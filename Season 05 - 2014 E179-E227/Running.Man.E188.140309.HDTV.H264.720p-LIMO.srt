00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,021
Let's go, Rain!

168
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,643
[Rain and Kwang Soo are already
finished changing.]

169
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:29,713
- Why are we wearing these life vests?
- Calm down.

170
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:37,870
[Boarding the boats to get closer
to the shipwreck.]

171
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:54,330
[The cool ocean air...]

172
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,436
There's the 'R' flag over there.

173
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:07,222
[Withstood so much to
become one with the element...]

174
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:11,897
[The shipwrecks are now an infamous
symbol of Tangalooma.]

175
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,473
We didn't build that ship, did we?

176
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,037
[You can't be serious...
That's just utterly absurd.]

177
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,258
Really ship?

178
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,333
[You're really humiliating...]

179
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:37,391
[Adventure in Australia-
Arrives at the center of Tangalooma.]

180
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:44,752
[Find the hidden treasure chest
beneath the shipwreck.]

181
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:48,949
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin's boat takes off
in second place.]

182
00:16:55,736 --> 00:17:01,310
[Find the pacific ocean's lost treasure.]

183
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:03,564
- We have to win no matter what.
- Fighting!

184
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,595
Can we do something?
Bi-Kwang Cross?

185
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:11,049
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

186
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,269
[Time to put the flippers on.]

187
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:22,499
We've been on a plane, helicopter, a car,
an ATV and a boat in all this short time.

188
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,804
And now you want us to dive too?

189
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:30,748
- This is no joke.
- Woo Bin is in total shock right now.

190
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,303
- This is a total blockbuster.
- This was my first time with everything.

191
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,345
First time doing all this
since I've been born.

192
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,708
You must put on your diving equipment, and
you'll find four treasure chests in the water.

193
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:43,711
[What will they find under the water?]

194
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:51,380
[There are four sunken treasure chests
beneath the waters of the Pacific Ocean.]

195
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:53,447
You must choose one of the treasure chests.

196
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,356
Choose one of the locked treasure chests.

197
00:17:56,357 --> 00:18:00,388
[Each of the treasure chests are
locked with their own padlocks.]

198
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,963
You will find many different keys
on the bottom of the ocean.

199
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:07,069
[Find the locks of keys that are
scattered about the bottom of the ocean.]

200
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:12,853
[Open the treasure chest by finding
the key that matches the lock.]

201
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:15,184
[What will they find in those chests?]

202
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:19,903
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha arrive
in third place.]

203
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:22,960
- What is this?
- What is all this?

204
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,440
- We have to put all those on?
- What are you guys doing?

205
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,998
What do you think this is for?
Put your flippers on and get in the water!

206
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,312
- We have to put the flippers on?
- What else would you put on? High heels?

207
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,885
[Muscle boy in high heels...
there goes the imagination.]

208
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,472
Hey, Gary. Do you think
that you can find the treasure?

209
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,204
- We have to find it.
- Okay, let's go find it!

210
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,788
- Are you good at diving?
- No, I'm not very good at it.

211
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,334
I'm not good at it either.

212
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:48,870
I was in the marines...
but I never did the diving.

213
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:55,643
[Meanwhile, all the other teams are already
in their gear and ready to dive.]

214
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:59,544
[Now that they're ready to dive,
the power of the ocean frightens them.]

215
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:06,315
[But athletic Rain jumps in
without any hesitation.]

216
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:19,487
[What will the underwater life
in the Pacific Ocean look like?]

217
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:27,585
[All the others follow Rain's lead,
and jump in the water as well.]

218
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:37,247
[Treading through the water
towards the shipwreck.]

219
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,671
Look at all the fish!

220
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:47,912
There are a ton of fish in the water!

221
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:54,778
[Sheltered between the coral,
and the shipwreck...]

222
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,483
[Fish of every color and size
are seen swimming in their habitat.]

223
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,639
- Why are there so many fish in the water?
- There are even more over here.

224
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,304
[All of the members are in awe of
the beauty found under the water.]

225
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:27,110
[The natural beauty and wonder of
the sunken ship, fish, and the ocean...]

226
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,120
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha also
get ready to dive.]

227
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:48,405
[This amazing sight is the first of many gifts
that they're receiving from Australia.]

228
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,427
[Rain swimming out to the furthest distance.]

229
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:09,540
[Leisurely enjoying the underwater scenery.]

230
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:24,519
[Just then-
He discovers a treasure chest!]

231
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,664
[Dives down immediately.]

232
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,384
[But... he's not gaining any speed?]

233
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:40,126
[Takes off his life-jacket, which is
deterring him from diving downward.]

234
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:50,636
[Dives down the right way.]

235
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:54,966
[He certainly is athletic-
Down to the ground in a blink of an eye.]

236
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:01,892
[Discovers all of the rings of keys!]

237
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:11,905
[Good plan! Back to the surface
with all the keys in hand.]

238
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:17,655
[Rain already discovers a treasure chest,
and gets all the keys in his hand!]

239
00:22:17,656 --> 00:22:21,275
- Rain found something!
- Already?

240
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:27,677
[Rain's already halfway complete with his
mission before others even get there.]

241
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,963
- Did you see the chest down below?
- I'm going to see if I can open it now.

242
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:36,959
[But... there are so many keys...]

243
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:44,317
[Will the ocean let go of
the lost treasure that easily?]

244
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:50,863
[Jae Suk is feeling anxious at seeing
Rain's progress.]

245
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,899
[This is our home!]

246
00:22:56,206 --> 00:23:01,497
[Is Jae Suk unable to dive down
because he's afraid of all the fish?]

247
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,483
[There's a treasure chest right
underneath Jae Suk!]

248
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:07,917
[It's a giant school of fish!]

249
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:11,097
[But he's unable to see the chest
because of the school of fish in his way.]

250
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:17,314
What do I do with all the fish?

251
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:21,313
[The formidable Pacific Ocean...]

252
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,531
I don't know if I can
get down there.

253
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,743
[Ha Ha attempts to dive down.]

254
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:32,705
[Lucky!
Discovers a treasure chest right away!]

255
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:40,032
[Head butts the sunken ship.]

256
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:50,799
[Attempts to dive down again
after regaining his wherewithal.]

257
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,479
[But... he's unable
to get down to the ground.]

258
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,689
[Why can't I get down there?]

259
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:05,335
[Even Yoo Hyuk with his phobia of the fish
makes another attempt to dive down.]

260
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,603
[But can't hold his breath long enough.]

261
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:21,822
[And Big-nose can't even stay afloat.]

262
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,352
[Woo Bin dives down as if
he's discovered something.]

263
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:31,619
[Kim Woo Bin is on his way!]

264
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:36,543
[Diving down below...]

265
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:43,084
[With one gulp of breath,
grabs a fistful of keys.]

266
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,317
[Dives back down with the keys
in his hand.]

267
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,835
[Dives down without hesitation.]

268
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:07,893
[Open sesame...]

269
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:18,021
[Ah... doesn't seem to be
the right key.]

270
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:30,227
[Yoo-ruce Willis takes a deep breath,
and dives down into the water.]

271
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,389
[Will this key be the right one?]

272
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,914
[Who are you?]

273
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:52,324
[Monster of the Pacific Ocean.]

274
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:55,845
[That poor thing...]

275
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,697
You want to try it, Kwang Soo?
Here, you go down and try it.

276
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:02,983
[And who's this character?]

277
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:09,816
[Fascinating world of the underwater
Pacific Ocean with diverse sea life.]

278
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:17,416
[Kwang-sea-cucumber dives down with the
key Rain chose for him in his hand.]

279
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,868
[It's the sea anemone monster
from earlier!]

280
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:43,116
[Yoo-anemone and Kwang-sea-cucumber -
Are the two sea monsters friends?]

281
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:48,989
[The first step in Adventure in Australia
isn't going as well as they'd hoped.]

282
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:51,343
The water is so salty!

283
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,697
What do we do?
This is too hard!

284
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:59,506
[Will they be able to beat this giant ocean
to get the treasure in their hands?]

285
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,141
[Ace Rain dives down again amongst
all the other floundering members.]

286
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:07,869
[Will he get the chest opened
this time?]

287
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:14,267
[It opened!]

288
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:23,191
[What will he find inside?]

289
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:27,719
[Is this the lost treasure of Australia?]

290
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,088
[Rain gets his hands on the glass bottle
from inside the treasure chest!]

291
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,533
We found it!

292
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:38,741
[Seriously?]

293
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:43,935
Okay, let's go.
I'm exhausted.

294
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,747
We got the orange treasure chest.

295
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:59,449
[Unbelievable!
Rain and Kwang Soo are first to leave.]

296
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,147
We're taking off!

297
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:08,739
- Where are you going?
- Rain really is amazing!

298
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,173
No, stay for a while.

299
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,783
Help me get over there.

300
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,527
[Where are you going?]

301
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:32,162
[The younger of the Easy Brothers is dragging
Big-nose off into the wrong direction.]

302
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,145
You can't hang onto me!

303
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:48,625
[Even Big-nose's personal VJ, Yoo Suk,
comes in to join the fray.]

304
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,355
Where are you going, Suk Jin?

305
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:51,985
Suk Jin!

306
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:56,755
[Big-nose is getting further and
further away from his treasure chest.]

307
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,968
I have to get back to my treasure chest.

308
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:07,577
[Exhausted Big-nose relies on the jet ski
to get him back to where he needs to be.]

309
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:10,679
- What are you doing?
- The thing is...

310
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:15,739
[He has a hard enough time on land,
so asking him to dive underwater is a bit...]

311
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,435
[But the man suffering the most
from Big-nose is...]

312
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:24,010
- We got ours, so let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

313
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:27,578
You two can take your glass bottle back
to the beach and receive your next order.

314
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:35,169
- How did you find that bottle?
- I somehow got one of the keys to open it.

315
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,015
[Check the contents of the glass bottle
once back on the beach.]

316
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,300
- Rain!
- What?

317
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,911
I should be saying that first, right?
You can just do it.

318
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,740
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

319
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,736
[What could be inside the glass bottle?]

320
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:52,728
You just wait, Gary.

321
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:58,136
[Gary has been the only member of this team
working hard for the past 20 minutes.]

322
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,758
[Wait just a little bit longer...]

323
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,464
[I'm coming to help you.]

324
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:12,777
[But... not the world's best swimmer.]

325
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:19,809
[Gary is working twice as hard as others to
make up for Big-nose's lack of participation.]

326
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:28,700
[Even the sand isn't helping me out today...]

327
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:34,136
[I want a different teammate!]

328
00:30:40,311 --> 00:30:44,010
[What? Why is he swimming in place?]

329
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:49,676
[He's making some progress.
Or maybe not.]

330
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,240
This is really hard.

331
00:31:01,522 --> 00:31:04,448
[Diver Woo Bin dives back down!]

332
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:07,118
[Random Mr. Capable dives back down too!]

333
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,530
[The ocean...
will I win, or will it beat me?]

334
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:19,355
[Gary vs Woo Bin-
Who will open up their chest first?]

335
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:31,557
[Woo Bin gets his chest to open!]

336
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,857
[The chest is opened!]

337
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,529
- I got it to open, Jae Suk.
- What?

338
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:50,404
[You got it open?]

339
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,550
[But he didn't bring the bottle
back up to the surface with him.]

340
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:57,266
[Jae Suk's turn to dive down.]

341
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,745
[The glass bottle is now in his hands!]

342
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:10,810
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin.
Tangalooma mission- Clear!]

343
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:17,832
[Runny nose from the excitement
of getting the chest to open.]

344
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:22,261
<i>[Runny nose pirate of the Pacific.]</i>

345
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:27,208
[Bi-Kwang Team arrives back on the beach
in first place.]

346
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:36,422
- I got lucky.
- What did I tell you? I told you I'll do it!

347
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,516
[What was it that you did, Kwang Soo?]

348
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,758
[Time to find out what's inside
of the glass bottle.]

349
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:52,494
[But it's not coming out...]

350
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:53,938
Can you do this for me?

351
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,720
- Look at how easy that was.
- You're so good at everything.

352
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,894
[On the other hand,
Rain gets it out in his first try.]

353
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:01,173
We're in total synch.

354
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:02,972
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

355
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,156
- I didn't know you liked things like that.
- Yeah, I like it.

356
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,762
[Finally able to check the parchment
found inside the treasure chest.]

357
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:14,390
[So this is Australia's lost treasure?]

358
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,667
What is this?

359
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:23,686
[Their next location?]

360
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:38,279
[Wait, it's not the treasure,
but a map to the next location?]

361
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,076
We have to go to the sanctuary
from Tangalooma?

362
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:42,748
- We have to get back on the helicopter?
- Yes, that's correct.

363
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:46,286
[Oh My God]

364
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:52,296
[No... this has to be a nightmare.]

365
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,230
Since your team came in at first place...

366
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:57,304
Remember choosing a card of one of
the four elements earlier?

367
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:58,503
Yes.

368
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:01,953
[Water, wind, fire, and earth...]

369
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:06,123
<i>In order to find the lost treasure,
you need to find earth's four elements first.</i>

370
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:09,319
<i>Water, fire, wind, and earth.</i>

371
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,702
<i>These four elements must be combined
in order for you to find the lost treasure.</i>

372
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:24,393
<i>Each of you may now step up to the table,
and choose one of the 8 cards on the table.</i>

373
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:29,425
<i>That will determine which of the four
elements you'll each end up with.</i>

374
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:30,907
[Kwang Soo chooses the element of wind.]

375
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:36,839
[Rain also chooses the element of wind.]

376
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,854
Since you came in at first place
during the first mission...

377
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,287
you are allowed to ask me
one question.

378
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:52,705
Of the four elements-
Water, fire, wind and earth...

379
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:55,988
- No one knows which card they picked, right?
- No, we don't.

380
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:59,608
You can ask me one question about your cards
because you came in at first place.

381
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:03,841
[And that question is...]

382
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:08,627
<i>[Of the four elements,
am I element 'X'?]</i>

383
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:11,839
You need to figure out who has
which element.

384
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,391
- You ask him about yours.
- About mine?

385
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,289
Rock, paper, scissors.

386
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,117
[You both can ask a question,
so why are you going through all this?]

387
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,545
- I thought you said ask him about mine.
- I really am so sorry.

388
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:25,551
- But you have to let me know.
- What my element is?

389
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:27,963
I really don't like to be betrayed.

390
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:29,829
- I'm going to put my faith in you.
- Then let's just do it this way.

391
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,969
- Let's play Rock, paper, scissors...
- Are you saying that you'll betray me?

392
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,987
No, that's not what I mean.
The winner asks, and no need to share.

393
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:42,096
[Agrees to have the winner ask the question,
and no need to share their answer.]

394
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,674
Rock, paper, scissors.

395
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,257
[Rain wins.]

396
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:53,376
[We're saying that both of you
can ask the question!]

397
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,810
Then that rock, paper, scissors
is meaningless.

398
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:58,091
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

399
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,923
We're going to get the answer together!

400
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,314
[In the end, they're going to hear
the answer together.]

401
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:04,817
Of the four elements, am I...

402
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:06,747
the element of 'water'?

403
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:11,826
[Rain asks the question-
Am I the element of 'water'?]

404
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,310
No, you're not.

405
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,122
- I can only ask one question?
- That's correct.

406
00:36:17,123 --> 00:36:21,606
Since you're not the element of water,
you're either wind, fire or earth.

407
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:23,196
So you're not water.

408
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,763
[How can these four elements be
correlated to the lost treasure?]

409
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,977
[Just then...]

410
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:34,543
[Those muscles...]

411
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:38,661
[Is the muscle boy in the midst of
chastising the padlock?]

412
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,993
[You didn't rip that lid open with
your strength, did you?]

413
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,627
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha
clear their shipwreck mission.]

414
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,638
[It's Kwang Soo's turn to
ask the question.]

415
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,528
No, together. You said
you were going to do it together.

416
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,175
- Hey!
- No, I didn't do anything.

417
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,516
Of the four elements...

418
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:28,324
Am I... the element of 'wind'?

419
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:31,624
[Of the four elements,
he Kwang Soo the element of 'wind'?]

420
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,125
Of the four elements...
am I the element of 'water'?

421
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,072
- What are you doing?
- I mean, am I the wind?

422
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm going to go with the 'wind'.

423
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:42,001
Think about this carefully.
You only get one chance.

424
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,764
- Trust me. Go with the wind.
- But if that's correct...

425
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:47,190
- What about it?
- Then you know what my element is.

426
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:50,641
Just hear me out.

427
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:53,016
- You really are something else!
- That's not what I mean!

428
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,784
No, that's not what I mean.

429
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:59,006
I'm going to ask him about the wind,
but can I talk to him privately?

430
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:00,818
No way!

431
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:02,513
Just hurry up and ask the question.

432
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,757
Think about this carefully.

433
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:07,368
If you betray me now, I will chase you down
to the ends of the earth and make you pay.

434
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:08,505
Am I...

435
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,777
the element of 'earth'?

436
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,328
No, you're not.

437
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:17,803
[That's why you should've
listened to him...]

438
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:19,387
So I'm either wind, water, or fire.

439
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,654
There you are.

440
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:26,132
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin land in second place.]

441
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:27,987
- Are you tired?
- I'm exhausted.

442
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:34,214
[This team confirms their next destination.]

443
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:35,692
We have to get back on the
helicopter again?

444
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:39,758
[Exact same response from all the
scaredy Running Man members.]

445
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,922
Okay, let's go.
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

446
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:44,610
[Bi-Kwang Team rushes off
to their next destination.]

447
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:47,770
You can ask me a question from this list.

448
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:53,004
<i>[Of the four elements,
is one of us the element 'X'?]</i>

449
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:55,510
- Want to go with 'fire'?
- Since we're wearing red?

450
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:56,692
Okay, let's do it.

451
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:59,445
Of the two of us,
is there the element of 'fire'?

452
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:00,658
- Fire?
- Yes.

453
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:02,675
Of the two of you...

454
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,036
the element of fire...

455
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:06,894
does exist.

456
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:12,229
[Jae Suk is the element of 'fire'.]

457
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,616
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

458
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:19,318
[What's the meaning of these
four elements?]

459
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:23,238
[The helicopters are on standby.]

460
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:28,374
[Bi-Kwang Team is off on their way to
Currumbin Sanctuary.]

461
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:39,181
[The massive land of Australia-
Chopper for transportation to save time.]

462
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,135
[Automatically breaks out in cry of fear
whenever he's in the chopper.]

463
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,766
[Second place winners, Jae Suk and Woo Bin,
also board their chopper again.]

464
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,447
Currumbin Sanctuary.

465
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:16,270
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha are confirming
their next place of destination.]

466
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:18,377
We have to get back on the helicopter?

467
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:21,094
Are we?
Tell me!

468
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:23,247
[Same response from everyone alike!]

469
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,380
Can we just swim there?

470
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,261
I think we can just swim over there.
I'd rather just swim over there.

471
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,626
[Australia is such a huge country,
and we're on a bit of a time limit...]

472
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,509
[Gary musters up his last bit of strength
to dive back down underwater.]

473
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:43,253
[The chest finally opens up!]

474
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:51,202
- You did it all.
- No, we did it together!

475
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:53,668
- You did it all.
- We did it together!

476
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:55,664
- No, you did it.
- Yes, I did it.

477
00:40:57,352 --> 00:40:59,748
[Still upset Gary.]

478
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,512
We didn't bring our bottle, did we?

479
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:08,835
[Oh My God]

480
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:12,909
[After all that hard work,
they forgot to bring their bottle.]

481
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,249
- I gave you the bottle!
- Let's go back and get it.

482
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,321
Let's go back and get it.
So sorry about that.

483
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:22,098
[Nothing seems to go right for this team.]

484
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,059
I can't believe we forgot to
bring our bottle.

485
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,537
- Sorry.
- Sorry, but one more time.

486
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:40,089
[Back they go on their boat...
and grasps the bottle tightly in his hands.]

487
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,902
When you two left Korea...

488
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:46,755
we asked you to choose a card
from the stack of four elements, right?

489
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:50,576
[Everyone's already gone,
and no one else is left on the beach.]

490
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:53,422
[Just like the third place winners,
this team doesn't get any hints.]

491
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:58,146
Australia!

492
00:41:58,147 --> 00:41:59,803

They're so gentle!

665
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:55,827
I thought that they'd kick me like they do in
the cartoons, but they're nothing like that.

666
00:53:57,551 --> 00:54:00,685
[People friendly kangaroos.]

667
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:06,738
[We're one big happy kangaroo family.]

668
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,066
Wow, I can't believe I'm doing this.

669
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:13,739
I've only seen this being done on TV.

670
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,144
I've never been able to touch them
in person like this before.

671
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:19,557
Wow... they really are super adorable.

672
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:23,753
They're so cute.

673

[He was afraid of them first...
but now he's even petting them.]

674
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:28,555
- Are you touching them?
- Yeah, they're so cute.

675
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,823
- I feel like it's going to hit me.
- No, it's not going to hit you.

676
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,949
I've seen too many kangaroos being
violent in cartoons.

677
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,904
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean, right?

678
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,825
They're usually kicking or punching on TV.

679
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:39,699
So I thought they were going to be violent,
but they're nothing like that.

680
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,013
I can't help but love these creatures.

681

with all these kangaroos in Australia.]

Then Gary can jump the difference.

686
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,285
- Okay, let's do this.
- You can jump that much, right?

687
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,869
[Will Gary's wish be answered?]

688
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,209

instead of running for it.</i>

[A comedic fail.]

692
00:55:24,602 --> 00:55:26,005

[Hopeless Big-nose Kangaroo.]

694

- Bye.
- Bye guys.

696
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,150
So cute.

697
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:42,425

[The cutie pie is scratching its back
just like a human being!]

699

Over here?

[He chooses one picture out of the bunch.]

706
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,060
Now, go find that koala.

707
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,874
[Must find the koala in the picture.]

708
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,686
If you go over there,
you'll find another zookeeper.

709
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:35,098
Take a picture with that koala, and show it
to the zookeeper for confirmation to pass.

710
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,051
Keeley?

711
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:39,841
But don't you get the feeling that
we'll be able to find Keeley easily?

712

come in at first place today.

Yes, I know the feeling.

715

able to do it.

716

[Kwang Soo succeeded his jump,
now it's up to Rain to succeed his part.]

717
00:56:53,718 --> 00:56:55,627
I know you can do it, but your costume
will deter you from succeeding.

718
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:57,947
- Okay.
- You're not going to succeed.

I should've taken my costume off
back there.

[You look pretty hot in that costume.]

731
00:57:48,951 --> 00:57:52,712
I really enjoyed the time that I spent
with the kangaroos back there.

Trying to imitate the animals even in
the way that they look...

open up their hearts to me.

734
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,254
So that's why I kept this on thinking
that it would help me with the koalas too.

735

- But I'm so hot now.
- What is that?

00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,486

- And what else?
- Riding the four wheeler.

745

from the drama, 'Heirs' is gone.

You know that you're
a bit of a bumbling klutz, right?

747
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:49,069
What?

748
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,654
You know that you're a klutz?

I never knew that about myself before,
but being on RM is making me realize that now.

I think all the things that we do may
look easy to the viewers out there.

751

so how are they supposed to find Keeley?]

760

about a competition between Suk Jin and I?

Between Suk Jin and Ha Ha, the one who
jumps higher will win the mission.

769
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,252

- Yes, that sounds good to me.

Why do you think it's called the captain?

799
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,072

Can we go in there?
Isn't that Harry?

807

No, that's not the right color of fur.

01:04:02,489 --> 01:04:04,338
I'm not telling?

830
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:08,911
This is seriously...
things that I used to dream about.

831
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:11,372
- Dream about what?
- Conversing with someone in English.

832
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:14,978
[But you barely said a few words.]

833
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,340
- Woo Bin.
- Yes?

834
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:21,197
Amanda says this isn't Keeley.
Let's go look over that way.

835
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:24,250
[Decides to look elsewhere in the zoo.]

836
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:28,322
[Is this... the right place?]

837
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,937
[I don't know.]

838
01:04:32,984 --> 01:04:36,094
[Oh? But...]

839
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,940
Amanda's face is getting red.

840
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,423
[Is her face alerting him to
the koala's location?]

841
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:43,459
- Come here, Woo Bin.
- Okay.

842
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,780
Did you see Amanda's face?

843
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,399
Amanda is... this is my brother.

844
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,075
- Woo Bin Kim.
- Hello.

845
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,714
He's very handsome.

846
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:55,506
I'm still not telling.

847
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,658
That Amanda.
I think it's over here somewhere.

848
01:04:59,659 --> 01:05:01,096
Let's look over here.

849
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,577
Because Amanda kept looking
over this way.

850
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:06,105
I think I'm right about this one.

851
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:08,075
[Just then, Suk Jin comes up for
confirmation on picture of Harry?]

852
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:11,872
[It does kind of look like him...]

853
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,965
Sorry, that's not Harry.

854
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,940
This one is 'Sorry'?

855
01:05:17,941 --> 01:05:20,170
- No.
- Sorry?

856
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:23,675
[Renaming the koala to 'Sorry'?]

857
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,516
[Amanda, we're so sorry...]

858
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,932
Baby... Baby!

859
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,812
[They're still calling out Baby's name.]

860
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:39,862
[But that koala hasn't moved from
that position for the past 15 minutes.]

861
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,302
Baby!

862
01:05:42,303 --> 01:05:44,806
Baby?
Please look over here just once.

863
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,135
Just once.

864
01:05:46,136 --> 01:05:48,008
Baby?

865
01:05:48,014 --> 01:05:50,854
[Finally shows off its face!]

866
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:54,636
[Bi-Kwang are convinced that
they've found their Baby.]

867
01:05:54,637 --> 01:05:56,536
You're amazing.
We have to go to the right.

868
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:57,977
- We have to go to the right.
- Really?

869
01:05:57,978 --> 01:05:59,658
She's over there.

870
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:04,659
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin are searching for
their Keeley in another area.]

871
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,496
- How did you beat them?
- We have to take a picture.

872
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:12,926
[They need to check and see if this one
has a dot on its chest...]

873
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:17,430
I don't know. If this doesn't work,
let's go around to the back.

874
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,572
[I hope that this one is Keeley...]

875
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:25,081
[Needs the zookeeper to confirm whether
their picture is of Baby or not.]

876
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:26,852
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

877
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:29,487
- Thank you, and you?
- This is Baby, right?

878
01:06:30,837 --> 01:06:33,060
[It sort of looks like Baby...]

879
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:38,973
Sorry.

880
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:42,094
- You have failed the mission.
- Sorry.

881
01:06:42,095 --> 01:06:45,391
How can she be so sure? And
you're not as cool as you think, Jae Suk.

882
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:47,786
Sorry, but since Amanda turned you down,
you two need to leave.

883
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:50,871
- We didn't get turned down.
- Yes, you've been turned down, so leave.

884
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,104
Amanda.

885
01:06:53,105 --> 01:06:57,090
[The world star is ruining his image
in so many ways throughout the day.]

886
01:06:57,091 --> 01:06:58,236
Baby?

887
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:02,277
Look at the long hair around
the ears.

888
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:04,028
I think it's my koala bear.

889
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:06,820
The way the ears are shaped...

890
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:09,806
[What will their hard earned
picture get them?]

891
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,530
Keeley?

892
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:17,675
[Is it... the real Keeley this time?]

893
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:19,752
- Yes, that is Keeley.
- Yes!

894
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,737
[They got it correct!]

895
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:25,806
[Lucky Jae Suk and Woo Bin.]

896
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:28,729
[How does she know that
just from seeing the picture?]

897
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:33,611
The ears cover the sides of his nose.

898
01:07:33,612 --> 01:07:36,547
She just said the same thing
that we were thinking of.

899
01:07:37,288 --> 01:07:40,319
The face is very similar.

900
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:45,538
[Whatever the case, Jae Suk and Woo Bin
successfully pass the mission.]

901
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:48,640
[The box contains their next mission.]

902
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,256
- There's a surprise in here. Ready?
- Yeah.

903
01:07:53,306 --> 01:07:56,203
[A mission card and
a picture of a license plate?]

904
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:02,969
[Prepare for tomorrow's adventure
by purchasing food from the market.]

905
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,068
- Bye, Amanda! Thank you.
- Thank you.

906
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:07,547
Bye, thank you.

907
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,720
Can I take this off now?

908
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:12,351
I had no idea that it would be
so hot like this.

909
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:17,135
I was wearing a windbreaker
underneath the costume too.

910
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:20,445
I'm so dumb.
I can't believe how dumb I can be at times.

911
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:22,069
I can't believe myself.

912
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,892
Hi, Amanda.
Is this Baby?

913
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:25,616
[Bi-Kwang are desperately
searching for their Baby.]

914
01:08:25,617 --> 01:08:28,046
[The shape of the ears are similar?]

915
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:31,532
Yes, you have Baby.
You have succeeded.

916
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:34,478
[They succeed in finding their Baby!]

917
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,372
Yes, that is our Baby.

918
01:08:36,373 --> 01:08:40,005
- Look at those big beautiful fluffy ears.
- See? I told you.

919
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:41,148
[The big and fluffy ears are
Baby's unique feature.]

920
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,586
- Thank you.
- Biggest ears out of all the koalas.

921
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:48,668
- Is there something else?
- Yes, this is for you.

922
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:51,746
[Prepare for tomorrow's adventure
by purchasing food from the market.]

923
01:08:51,747 --> 01:08:54,936
- Rain, we really are...
- We really are a good team.

924
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:12,145
[Cruising down the streets of Australia
in the jeep with the top down!]

925
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,102
I can't believe the scenery.

926
01:09:16,103 --> 01:09:18,988
- This is something else.
- This really is something, Woo Bin.

927
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:22,465
[The wheel is on the other side
in Australia.]

928
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:25,897
This is so nice.

929
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,656
We really are getting to do
all sorts of things today.

930
01:09:29,355 --> 01:09:33,009
[And what does Woo Bin say to
this situation?]

931
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:36,039
- This is my first time in this car too.
- It's my first time too.

932
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:40,034
[Everything today has been a
first time experience for Woo Bin.]

933
01:09:40,502 --> 01:09:45,489
This car calls for a trip down to the lake
or a river to go fishing.

934
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,738
But instead of something outdoorsy,
we have to go to the market in this car.

935
01:09:49,407 --> 01:09:51,632
- We have to go buy food.
- Food.

936
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,446
[I bet the market will shock you too.]

937
01:09:53,447 --> 01:09:56,019
- This is awesome to be driving in this!
- This is so cool!

938
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,054
- This is nice!
- This is a great experience.

939
01:09:58,055 --> 01:10:00,332
- This is what Australia is all about!
- That's right.

940
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:04,828
I wonder if the team that comes in
at last place will have to cook dinner?

941
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:08,174
I bet they either have to cook dinner,
or do the dishes.

942
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:10,644
[An unbelievable privilege
will go to the first place winning team!]

943
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:15,933
I think we need to come in at least at
second place to avoid having to cook.

944
01:10:15,937 --> 01:10:19,172
[Everyone wants to avoid
having to cook.]

945
01:10:23,703 --> 01:10:26,949
[Next destination- The market.]

946
01:10:29,704 --> 01:10:33,172
[Australian market full of food
and basic household necessities.]

947
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:36,013
[What will they buy?]

948
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,507
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin are first to arrive.]

949
01:10:41,508 --> 01:10:43,633
- Go pick out whatever you'd like.
- Really?

950
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,562
[A mission card inside the
shopping carts?]

951
01:10:49,838 --> 01:10:52,213
What is all this?

952
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:56,371
- Salt, and canola oil...
- Let's just go inside.

953
01:10:56,372 --> 01:10:58,506
- This is seriously...
- Let's go.

954
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:00,599
Are we at the right place?

955
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,427
Hello.

956
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,103
Yes, hello.

957
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:09,819
Hang on.

958
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:14,688
First... I think this is some kind
of a bean?

959
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,132
[Everything is in English,
so they're clueless as to what to buy.]

960
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:19,955
- Can we use a translating app?
- Can we have this translated?

961
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:22,027
[Rule- Prohibited
from using a translating app.]

962
01:11:23,528 --> 01:11:29,843
[Looks... and looks again,
but everything still looks unfamiliar.]

963
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,878
[Bi-Kwang are next to arrive.]

964
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:38,649
- You have to choose the right one.
- You do it. I chose earlier.

965
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,479
We picked the middle one earlier,
so let's pick the middle one again.

966
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,077
[Chooses the cart in the middle.]

967
01:11:44,825 --> 01:11:47,742
Zucchini?

968
01:11:53,265 --> 01:11:55,342
- Onion.
- Onion?

969
01:11:56,299 --> 01:11:57,502
- Onion?
- Pork.

970
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:02,759
[This team's list is also full of
unfamiliar words.]

971
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,538
[Rain is picking up the items
that he thinks is right.]

972
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,251
[But this mission doesn't seem to be
all that easy for the Hollywood star either?]

973
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:14,233
Excuse me, but is this beef?

974
01:12:15,985 --> 01:12:18,521
Blade steak.
I don't think you'll like it.

975
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:21,105
- Here's the onion.
- That is beef.

976
01:12:21,106 --> 01:12:23,375
- I got the onion.
- Thank you.

977
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:25,969
[Rule- Allowed to ask other shoppers.]

978
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,891
High-five!

979
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:37,455
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha
also start on their mission.]

980
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:39,402
There are so many delicious looking things.

981
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:49,762
[Even though the market is full of food...
they need to complete their mission first.]

982
01:12:50,358 --> 01:12:53,508
[Ha Ha's looking for the balsamic vinegar.]

983
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:55,999
- I can't help you, I'm sorry.
- Balsamic.

984
01:12:57,491 --> 01:13:02,525
[Repeats the word over and over
with his Korean accent.]

985
01:13:03,502 --> 01:13:06,281
[Has no clue what he's trying to say.]

986
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,907
Balsamic.

987
01:13:10,148 --> 01:13:12,887
Bal-sa-mic?
Bal-Sa-mic.

988
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,516
Bal-sa-Mic?

989
01:13:15,221 --> 01:13:18,255
[So close, yet so far...]

990
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:19,613
Hi.

991
01:13:20,306 --> 01:13:22,383
Where is balsamic sauce?

992
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:25,996
Balsamic.

993
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:28,837
- I don't know.
- Balsamic.

994
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,041
Balsamic.

995
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,942
- Balsamic sauce.
- I don't know.

996
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,757
Thank you.

997
01:13:37,134 --> 01:13:38,673
- Balsamic?
- Yes, balsamic!

998
01:13:38,674 --> 01:13:41,764
- Yeah, balsamic. Where is it?
- It's right over here.

999
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:44,818
- Thank you. You're so kind!
- Ha Ha?

1000
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:48,273
[This Australian guy even knows
Ha Ha's name!]

1001
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:50,177
He's like my Australian uncle.

1002
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:54,537
Balsamic?

1003
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:57,665
[Finally finds the balsamic sauce
thanks to the help of this kind man!]

1004
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,151
- Thank you. What's your name?
- Chris.

1005
01:14:00,152 --> 01:14:03,664
- Chris. Chris uncle. Thank you.
- Sure.

1006
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:05,497
- Thank you.
- Fighting.

1007
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:09,538
Jong Kook.
I found the balsamic sauce.

1008
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:14,815
[Gary and Suk Jin are also
busy shopping.]

1009
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:16,909
I can't believe that he's
making me do this.

1010
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,767
Why is he making me do this?

1011
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:22,365
[Gary is busy running on his feet while
Big-nose is left pushing the cart around.]

1012
01:14:28,759 --> 01:14:30,970
- Comedy?
- Yes, I'm a comedian.

1013
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,789
[Finds the milk while amusing
other shoppers.]

1014
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:39,505
[Finds the apricot thanks to the help
of other friendly shoppers!]

1015
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:41,349
- Do you want to double check?
- Yes.

1016
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:45,347
[Ha Ha found the prawns...]

1017
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:46,627
How many?

1018
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:50,017
How do you say, 'enough' in English?

1019
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:53,260
Enough.
(Said in Korean with an accent.)

1020
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:55,354
Thank you.

1021
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:58,338
[Succeeds in getting the shrimp.]

1022
01:14:58,339 --> 01:14:59,987
I got the shrimp.

1023
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,243
[Bi-Kwang succeeds in getting
the final item on their list.]

1024
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:11,679
- Can you get out of the way?
- Why?

1025
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,362
- Out of my way.
- Where are you going?

1026
01:15:14,273 --> 01:15:15,927
We're done.

1027
01:15:16,376 --> 01:15:20,287
[Bi-Kwang completes their shopping list.]

1028
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:24,653
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1029
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:28,568
[Bi-Kwang succeeds
their mission in first place.]

1030
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:30,655
I'm taking this to the car,
so put this all back.

1031
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:33,541
[Time to head to their dorm
for the night.]

1032
01:15:34,244 --> 01:15:38,291
- Tickin... tickin cream?
- Thickening cream? This way.

1033
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:41,297
Tickin... she understood what I said.

1034
01:15:41,298 --> 01:15:43,115
Wow, that's so amazing.

1035
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,665
This one?
Okay, here it is.

1036
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:48,179
[Big-nose finds the thickening cream!]

1037
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,259
- I found the penne, Suk Jin.
- I found the cream.

1038
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,895
- You got it?
- Then we're all done!

1039
01:15:54,148 --> 01:15:56,555
[Off to the cash register
now that they're done shopping!]

1040
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,772
[Checking each of the items
that they've bought.]

1041
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:04,681
- Tickin cream.
- Yes.

1042
01:16:05,787 --> 01:16:08,577
And this pepper is... peppercorn?

1043
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:13,622
- I think we're in second place.
- In second place?

1044
01:16:13,623 --> 01:16:16,105
[Suk Jin and Gary complete the mission
in second place.]

1045
01:16:17,436 --> 01:16:19,357
Help please.
Perch.

1046
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:21,709
I'm not sure, sorry.

1047
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:24,603
She keep smiling at me and
tells me that she doesn't understand.

1048
01:16:24,604 --> 01:16:26,099
Perch?

1049
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:28,549
Here's the perch right here!

1050
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,392
Nile perch.

1051
01:16:30,393 --> 01:16:32,973
[Jae Suk finds the perch.]

1052
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,495
Here it is right here.

1053
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,020
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin
complete their shopping list.]

1054
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,839
- Do you think that we were too quick?
- We're good.

1055
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,636
We're in second place right now.

1056
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:50,695
[Off to their final destination of the day-
The dormitory.]

1057
01:16:53,132 --> 01:16:56,116
[Who will be the first to arrive?]

1058
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:59,142
We have to keep choosing
whatever is in the middle.

1059
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:01,788
- Wow.
- Bi-Kwang-Cross!

1060
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:18,232
[Palm Beach- A famous beach on the Gold Coast.
One of the most famous beaches in Australia.]

1061
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,927
[And their dormitory is
right on the beach.]

1062
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:23,047
[Bi-Kwang is the first team to arrive.]

1063
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:25,725
- Rain!
- Bi-Kwang-Cross!

1064
01:17:25,726 --> 01:17:28,564
I told you to just trust me, didn't I?

1065
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:34,552
You are the first ones to arrive,
and as you can see, there are four boxes.

1066
01:17:34,553 --> 01:17:36,204
Opens up the first place box.

1067
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:39,238
[Different chests for each place holder?]

1068
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:42,430
[Another mission card instead
of a treasure?]

1069
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:48,839
<i>[You are allowed to pick your roommate,
and the person you want to team up with.]</i>

1070
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,496
- What does that mean?
- So this is where we're staying?

1071
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,990
[House of extreme luxury.]

1072
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,848
- Why aren't you even acting surprised?
- No, it's not that.

1073
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:15,986
Isn't this your first time
at a place like this?

1074
01:18:15,987 --> 01:18:18,315
- No, this is just like my house.
- Come on.

1075
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:20,569
How could they have copied it
so perfectly?

1076
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:25,039
How can this be anything like your house?
Look at the amazing view.

1077
01:18:25,907 --> 01:18:27,480
Look at all this.

1078
01:18:29,477 --> 01:18:38,878
[The amazing view...
has them shout out in shock and awe.]

1079
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:41,191
Wow, this seriously is no joke.

1080
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:46,167
It's a four story house.

1081
01:18:47,266 --> 01:18:50,172
[This is their dormitory for the night.]

1082
01:18:50,921 --> 01:18:52,377
Welcome.

1083
01:18:52,378 --> 01:18:55,941
What?
You're kind of cocky, aren't you?

1084
01:18:57,273 --> 01:19:00,146
- You were acting shocked earlier too.
- I'm welcoming you into the home.

1085
01:19:00,147 --> 01:19:02,292
It's pretty similar to my home.

1086
01:19:03,214 --> 01:19:07,824
- Anyways... we were a great team today.
- We were in perfect sync.

1087
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:10,202
I'm telling you this again,
but you can't betray me, got it?

1088
01:19:10,868 --> 01:19:15,159
[Awake or asleep,
must watch out for Giraffe's betrayal.]

1089
01:19:16,816 --> 01:19:19,770
[Suk Jin and Gary arrive in second place.]

1090
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:22,810
- Okay, let's go in.
- Of the four elements?

1091
01:19:22,811 --> 01:19:24,696
<i>Wow, this place is amazing.</i>

1092
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:28,906
[Lost out on their chance to ask the question
with Gary and Suk Jin's entrance.]

1093
01:19:30,924 --> 01:19:35,667
[Automatic gasp in awe at the view.]

1094
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:39,039
I can't believe this!

1095
01:19:39,971 --> 01:19:42,544
[While everyone else is
outside looking at the view...]

1096
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:44,539
[This is my chance!]

1097
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:49,653
Of the four elements...
am I the element of 'Fire'?

1098
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:52,192
- Fire?
- Am I the element of fire?

1099
01:19:52,193 --> 01:19:53,637
No, you are not.

1100
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,762
What was your first element
you asked about?

1101
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,828
Wait.
Rain!

1102
01:19:58,504 --> 01:20:00,019
What are you doing?

1103
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:02,421
- Did you just ask them?
- I'll tell you what I asked.

1104
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:05,015
- I can't believe you!
- What?

1105
01:20:05,016 --> 01:20:06,663
So this is what you're like?

1106
01:20:06,664 --> 01:20:10,292
[You may be the Giraffe, but I'm Rain?]

1107
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:12,953
No, I didn't ask him.

1108
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:14,970
- I don't believe you.
- Come on, Kwang Soo.

1109
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:17,787
[Once a friend, and now a foe?]

1110
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:19,733
You asked him if you're
the element of 'wind', right?

1111
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:23,154
I swear to God, I didn't ask that.
I asked if I was the element of 'earth'.

1112
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:25,210
[Kwang Soo's bluff and Rain's lie...]

1113
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:28,623
[They really are the perfect combo.]

1114
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:30,516
But I was told that I'm not.

1115
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:34,628
[Jae Suk and Woo Bin enter in third place.]

1116
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,508
This place is amazing.

1117
01:20:38,328 --> 01:20:40,960
[So I'm not fire either?]

1118
01:20:44,308 --> 01:20:46,540
I thought that this was your house.

1119
01:20:47,722 --> 01:20:50,100
[Attempting to ask his question
without Rain knowing.]

1120
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:55,160
- Am I the element of the 'wind'?
- Wind is...

1121
01:20:55,161 --> 01:20:57,070
<i>Wind is...</i>

1122
01:20:57,071 --> 01:20:58,835
Hey!

1123
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:03,628
You could've just told me!
Wait!

1124
01:21:03,629 --> 01:21:05,601
- Seriously!
- Why did you pause!

1125
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:07,746
- Hurry up and ask him.
- I'll ask the question again.

1126
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:10,752
[No choice but to ask the question
in front of Rain.]

1127
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:13,280
Of the four elements...

1128
01:21:15,048 --> 01:21:17,538
- Is water...
- Water?

1129
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,191
- Water is...
- No, just tell me only.

1130
01:21:21,192 --> 01:21:23,315
I'll tell you what I'm told.

1131
01:21:24,866 --> 01:21:28,806
You are... not the water.

1132
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:38,848
Since you came in at second place,
you have a question that you may ask.

1133
01:21:38,849 --> 01:21:42,299
You can ask if a certain element
exists between the two of you.

1134
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,754
And I can answer by either confirming,
or denying that the element exists.

1135
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:49,402
- One, two, three.
- Does the element of 'wind' exist?

1136
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:52,819
The element of the wind does not
exist between the two of you.

1137
01:21:54,371 --> 01:21:56,514
I have no idea then.

1138
01:21:57,074 --> 01:21:59,884
[Just what is the secret
of these four elements?]

1139
01:22:01,443 --> 01:22:04,608
- Is it okay to be wearing our shoes in here?
- Yes, it's okay.

1140
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,497
- This place is killer.
- It's amazing, isn't it?

1141
01:22:10,204 --> 01:22:14,343
[They feel bad walking around in this
beautiful place with their shoes on.]

1142
01:22:14,344 --> 01:22:16,784
- This is a total American drama, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

1143
01:22:16,785 --> 01:22:19,559
[The same concept as seen in
American dramas?]

1144
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,358
- Is it okay to be doing this?
- This is American style.

1145
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:25,498
- Should we swap the teams around?
- Yes.

1146
01:22:25,499 --> 01:22:29,696
The team that came in at first place will
have the first chance to swap out their team.

1147
01:22:29,697 --> 01:22:32,743
- Do we have to switch out our partners?
- Yes, you must.

1148
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:35,378
[Must switch our their partners.]

1149
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:37,620
You must keep
the four elements in mind.

1150
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:40,325
None of you know what you have
right now.

1151
01:22:40,326 --> 01:22:44,941
By switching the teams around,
you may be able to figure out what you have.

1152
01:22:44,942 --> 01:22:46,115
[A chance to figure out what their element is
by swapping out their partners.]

1153
01:22:46,116 --> 01:22:48,781
[Just what is the final mission
that awaits them?]

1154
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:51,286
I wonder if we have to play the name tag game
without knowing who our partner is?

1155
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:54,212
- Why are you...
- Why do you look so eager?

1156
01:22:54,213 --> 01:22:57,229
[Why take such a frightening guess
like that?]

1157
01:22:57,230 --> 01:23:00,317
I'm just talking out loud.
Can't I guess out loud like that?

1158
01:23:00,318 --> 01:23:03,265
Are you thinking about the
'My Love From Another Star' episode again?

1159
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:09,940
[The ultimate evil, Kkuk, was even more
evil than they had ever imagined.]

1160
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:11,877
I'm sorry, but let me just say
this right now.

1161
01:23:11,878 --> 01:23:14,543
Please let me take care of
Yoo Jae Suk myself.

1162
01:23:14,951 --> 01:23:18,210
Why must you be the one to
take care of me?

1163
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,427
Please let me take care of
Ji Suk Jin myself too.

1164
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:24,081
I must be the one to eliminate him.

1165
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:29,127
[Is he stressed out from having had to
take care of Big-nose all day?]

1166
01:23:31,137 --> 01:23:33,315
You did all the work today, Gary.

1167
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:35,559
Stop!
Stop saying that!

1168
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:41,899
And I didn't say this earlier, but
Woo Bin is here to seek his revenge too.

1169
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:45,394
- Revenge against whom?
- He was eliminated so easily the other time.

1170
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:50,726
[Woo Bin was eliminated in one blow
by Kkuk the last time he was on the show.]

1171
01:23:50,727 --> 01:23:52,645
[Just the thought of it still makes him
shake his head in shame.]

1172
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:56,453
First place winner must now state who
they'd like to team up with tomorrow.

1173
01:23:56,454 --> 01:24:03,181
Since Ji Hoon came in at first place,
he has to be generous and take Suk Jin on.

1174
01:24:03,182 --> 01:24:07,122
Ji Hoon needs to experience what
it's like to be teamed up with Suk Jin.

1175
01:24:07,724 --> 01:24:09,370
You need to know what that feels like.

1176
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:11,871
- Ji Hoon.
- You need to do it.

1177
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:14,495
If you don't pick me now,
I'm going to pick you when it's my turn.

1178
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:18,819
The person that you choose right now
will also be your roommate for the night.

1179
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,699
- Roommate?
- There are four rooms, and you'll share it.

1180
01:24:22,615 --> 01:24:25,453
You're going to have to clean the room,
and pick up after him.

1181
01:24:25,454 --> 01:24:27,697
Can you get me the towel, Ji Hoon?

1182
01:24:28,412 --> 01:24:30,918
[Just the thought of it is enough
to scare him out of his wits.]

1183
01:24:30,919 --> 01:24:35,311
There's no way that he can pick Jong Kook.
Then we'll all be finished tomorrow.

1184
01:24:35,312 --> 01:24:38,222
Are we going to swap out
our partners again tomorrow?

1185
01:24:38,223 --> 01:24:39,749
No, not tomorrow.

1186
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,334
[This is their last chance to
swap out their partners.]

1187
01:24:42,335 --> 01:24:45,366
- Is Ji Hyo not coming?
- She'll come even if it's just for Gary.

1188
01:24:45,367 --> 01:24:47,292
I'll give her a call later.

1189
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:50,534
- She doesn't take your calls, does she?
- No, she doesn't take my calls often.

1190
01:24:51,488 --> 01:24:54,460
Okay, I'm going to pick now.
I pick Jong Kook.

1191
01:25:01,717 --> 01:25:04,953
[The union of the two ultimate warriors!]

1192
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:10,362
Hey, you guys can't do that!
You need to stop them. That's not right!

1193
01:25:10,363 --> 01:25:14,232
We're all dead tomorrow!
No way this can happen.

1194
01:25:14,233 --> 01:25:17,137
[Where are you guys going to go?]

1195
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,654
I've always wanted to team up with him
and see what it would be like.

1196
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:24,633
[Kkuk looks to be extremely happy
with this turn of events.]

1197
01:25:24,634 --> 01:25:26,464
The two strongest guys are together?

1198
01:25:26,465 --> 01:25:28,999
[Kkuk and Rain- The ultimate combo.]

1199
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,537
Then we will combine our
traitorous instincts together.

1200
01:25:32,237 --> 01:25:36,526
[This is how they respond
to the ultimate warrior team?]

1201
01:25:36,527 --> 01:25:40,161
- No rules will exist tomorrow.
- I'm going to lay thumbtacks under your bed.

1202
01:25:41,998 --> 01:25:44,819
And you guys are going to
share a room together tonight, right?

1203
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,683
We'll see if you can sleep tonight.

1204
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:50,813
We're going to take turns to make sure
to keep the two of you awake all night.

1205
01:25:50,814 --> 01:25:53,303
We'll take turns and keep you guys awake.

1206
01:25:53,304 --> 01:25:56,981
- This is really unfair.
- This is the worst we've had.

1207
01:25:56,982 --> 01:26:00,821
[The ultimate team in history-
Kkuk and Rain.]

1208
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,415
- They're the Dream Team.
- I feel exhausted already.

1209
01:26:06,991 --> 01:26:10,385
Woo Bin's desire to get his revenge is all
gone at the sight of you two right now.

1210
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:13,164
[Woo Bin's desire for revenge has melted away
like melting snow at the sight of them.]

1211
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:18,362
What if Kwang Soo chooses Woo Bin now?
Then we really would be screwed.

1212
01:26:18,363 --> 01:26:21,855
[If Kwang Soo chooses Woo Bin now,
there would be no hope for the rest.]

1213
01:26:21,856 --> 01:26:24,475
You know what I'm thinking
right now?

1214
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:27,587
If Kwang Soo ends up choosing Woo Bin...

1215
01:26:27,588 --> 01:26:30,197
then you two will get the next chance
to make your selection.

1216
01:26:30,198 --> 01:26:34,799
Which means, Gary will choose Ha Ha,
and then it'll all be over for me.

1217
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,067
[Jae Suk will be stuck with Big-nose.]

1218
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,486
It'll be all over for me!

1219
01:26:40,823 --> 01:26:43,790
Kim Woo Bin!

1220
01:26:50,753 --> 01:26:53,967
[The strongest combo,
and the tallest combo.]

1221
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:55,741
- Go with Ha Ha.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

1222
01:26:55,742 --> 01:26:57,919
[Suk Jin chooses Jae Suk.]

1223
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,154
[Which leaves Gary and Ha Ha together.]

1224
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:05,591
I feel like I'm going to lose it!

1225
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:07,550
[Inescapable Big-nose roulette.]

1226
01:27:08,606 --> 01:27:10,878
- You need to rethink this.
- It's time to start cooking now.

1227
01:27:11,278 --> 01:27:14,501
[The long and arduous day
comes to an end.]

1228
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:17,371
[Preparing a relaxing dinner.]

1229
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:22,274
[On the dinner menu-
Australian style steak.]

1230
01:27:24,797 --> 01:27:26,890
So that's how you grill it.

1231
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:33,370
- Suk Jin.
- Yeah?

1232
01:27:33,371 --> 01:27:35,373
- Can I see your cellphone real quick?
- My phone?

1233
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:39,824
[Why is he asking for
his cellphone all of a sudden?]

1234
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:46,504
Have you decided which room we'll
be using tonight, Kwang Soo?

1235
01:27:46,505 --> 01:27:50,372
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo are planning to
throw Big-nose into the pool.]

1236
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:55,902
[Woo Bin joins in on their prank.]

1237
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:57,910
Have you seen the pool over
here, Suk Jin?

1238
01:27:59,082 --> 01:28:02,509
[Big-nose is too busy
sampling the steak he's cooking.]

1239
01:28:04,944 --> 01:28:07,686
[Finishes checking out the pool.]

1240
01:28:10,758 --> 01:28:12,401
[Just then, Jae Suk joins the fray.]

1241
01:28:12,402 --> 01:28:14,938
[Moving the lighting out of the way
so that no one gets hurt.]

1242
01:28:19,147 --> 01:28:21,455
[Preparations are complete!]

1243
01:28:30,376 --> 01:28:32,772
[Being considerate?
Taking off his shoes and socks.]

1244
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,887
This is the least we could do for you.

1245
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,083
[All the guys are cheering at
Big-nose's plunge.]

1246
01:29:01,946 --> 01:29:03,715
You're in the water already,
so you might as well enjoy it.

1247
01:29:03,716 --> 01:29:06,569
[Mr. Capable comes out to
see what's going on.]

1248
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:09,906
Have you ever seen him swim?
He looks so funny when he swims.

1249
01:29:21,484 --> 01:29:24,504
- No, it wasn't me.
- These are my pajamas. I've got nothing else.

1250
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,353
These are my pajamas.

1251
01:29:28,354 --> 01:29:30,330
I don't have any more clothes.

1252
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:33,021
Come over here right now.

1253
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:36,970
I'll give you my clothes.

1254
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:41,171
[Repaying the favor immediately.]

1255
01:29:42,408 --> 01:29:45,308
[What do you mean, no?]

1256
01:29:48,253 --> 01:29:50,417
[Turns around and tells on Woo Bin too.]

1257
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:52,561
[Woo Bin turns around and runs away!]

1258
01:29:52,562 --> 01:29:55,714
[So Jae Suk gets to take his place.]

1259
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,328
I had nothing to do with this!

1260
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:02,710
[Jae Suk gets pulled in from
his grilling duties.]

1261
01:30:09,142 --> 01:30:11,666
[Come here, Woo Bin.]

1262
01:30:14,014 --> 01:30:16,794
[Kkuk goes to get Woo Bin.]

1263
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:21,954
Go get Woo Bin.

1264
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,940
Okay, fine.
This is war!

1265
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,251
[The guys use steak to
lure Woo Bin in.]

1266
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:45,709
Why did you have to start that joke?

1267
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:55,964
[Just thinking about it gets them angry,
so back into the pool Ha Ha goes!]

1268
01:30:56,815 --> 01:30:58,222
Woo Bin!

1269
01:31:00,302 --> 01:31:02,665
- I'll go in myself.
- That's no fun!

1270
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,424
[Forced dunking that even the heir
himself can't escape from.]

1271
01:31:20,784 --> 01:31:22,977
Jung Ji Hoon is the only one
left to go!

1272
01:31:26,706 --> 01:31:30,602
[Escaping out of there after witnessing
Woo Bin's forced plunge in the pool.]

1273
01:31:34,497 --> 01:31:38,204
[Their next target
is freshly showered Gary.]

1274
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:42,574
[You should've showered later...]

1275
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:51,777
[A domino effect.]

1276
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:59,298
[The only person left dry is Rain!]

1277
01:31:59,299 --> 01:32:01,810
I even put lotion on after my shower!

1278
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:03,956
This is Suk Jin's idea, isn't it?

1279
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,491
Who's left?

1280
01:32:48,566 --> 01:32:51,227
[What was that noise?]

1281
01:32:54,548 --> 01:32:59,328
[Water zombies lock their gaze
on their prey.]

1282
01:33:03,865 --> 01:33:06,719
[They found me.]

1283
01:33:21,766 --> 01:33:24,561
[Their last target, Rain!]

1284
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:28,522
[Rain just changed into his pajamas.]

1285
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,830
[Saves his pajamas from their fate first.]

1286
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:51,082
That must be his favorite shirt.

1287
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:11,328
[Eight wet, and excited men having fun.]

1288
