<i>The treasure is hidden in

<i>In Tangalooma National Park.</i>

<i>In order to find the treasure, you must
find the four elements of Earth.</i>

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,104
<i>Water, fire, wind, and fire.</i>

6
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,560
<i>These elements must come together
in order to find the treasure.</i>

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,916
<i>Stay tuned!</i>

8
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,365
- We have to go.
- Run!

9
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:34,605
Find the treasure chest at
the ship wreck.

10
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:40,607
You won first place
in the first mission.

11
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,944
You may ask one question.

12
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,051
Is it water?

13
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,239
Is one of us fire?

14
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,719
Kangaroos!

15
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:02,237
Koala!

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,118
Balsamic.

17
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:06,751
We're trying so many things today.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,437
Bi-Kwang-Cross!

19
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:19,497
Tomorrow morning, starting at 5:15.

20
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,993
The team to wake up first will
start the missions first.

21
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:24,002
5:15?

22
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:29,071
Your missions may vary.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,915
The first team to wake up
may choose the mission.

24
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,480
Pick the easy ones?

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,229
More likely to pick the easier mission.

26
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:42,097
You will have the advantages
from waking up early.

27
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:45,494
We will give you two self cameras each.

28
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:48,480
- Just relax with it.
- Okay.

29
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,263
I'm in Gary's room right now.

30
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:04,295
Gary is ill from taking care
of Ji Suk Jin.

31
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,778
He's having a bad dream.

32
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:11,224
And... he is sleeping naked.

33
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:14,080
- Shh...
- Come in.

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,552
It's a secret.

35
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,209
The behind-the-scenes with
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha.

36
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,270
I will turn on the light.

37
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,142
I almost died.

38
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,450
I almost died.

39
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:10,025
Behind-the-scenes with
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha.

40
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,712
See you next time!

41
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:14,795
He scared me.

42
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,521
What are you doing?
Go to bed.

43
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,555
Go to bed!

44
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,194
What are you doing?
Go to bed.

45
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,685
Kwang Soo! Where are we?

46
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:41,287
- This is Ji Hoon's...
- Rain is here.

47
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,534
- You scared me.
- What are you doing here?

48
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:53,358
Everyone gets one big bed
except for them. They got twins.

49
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:57,643
And there's Marilyn Monroe in the middle.

50
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,483
Will you stop?
Go to bed!

51
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,663
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

52
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,978
Go to bed!

53
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,718
- Do you know what time it is?
- Excuse me!

54
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,014
Ji Hoon isn't getting involved.

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,408
We need to get everyone.

56
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,595
- Ji Hoon!
- Rip it!

57
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,569
Woo Bin is here.

58
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,514
Woo Bin! Come here.

59
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,194
Woo Bin! You want to experience
something new?

60
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,141
It's not like that.
Come here for a sec.

61
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,124
Come here Woo Bin.

62
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,994
This will make you sleep like a baby.

63
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,242
It's for circulation.

64
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,101
I already saw it.

65
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,555
Accept it Woo Bin.

66
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,430
Relax.

67
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:09,038
I don't even know why
we're doing this.

68
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:14,953
What are you doing?
Go to bed. We're shooting tomorrow.

69
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,866
Sleep inside, come on.

70
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,421
Set it to 4:40 AM.

71
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,730
Why are you arguing?

72
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,765
He's not doing anything!

73
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,701
He doesn't even want to
set the alarm.

74
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:31,133
Why are you always having fights?

75
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:34,051
- He's driving me nuts.
- Take credit for everything.

76
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:41,528
<i>[Real big nose]</i>

77
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,676
- You're so ugly.
- My nostrils are my weak point.

78
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,519
- How long is the dance party going to be?
- Let's have fun for about 30 minutes.

79
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,490
- What time is the festival going to end?
- I would have had more fun if I weren't so tired.

80
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,223
We can only have fun for 30 minutes.

81
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,772
I can't get up.
I'm tired.

82
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:38,815
This is it!

83
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,386
Rain come in!
It's a dance party.

84
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:43,928
Rain!

85
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,651
This is the dance party!
Rain!

86
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:19,599
<i>- Do I have to take a shower again?
- I think you should.</i>

87
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:34,307
<i>[Next morning 5:00 AM]</i>

88
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:49,685
What?

89
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,693
- Gary!
- Huh?

90
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:04,296
<i>[The ultimate combo, Jong Kook-Rain
wins first place.]</i>

91
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,265
That was close.

92
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,637
When did you get here?

93
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,537
Gary!

94
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:20,016
Are they keywords about the mission?

95
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,651
You think they are our vehicles?

96
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:31,364
- What if we have to cross a river?
- You guys have good team chemistry.

97
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:33,653
You don't know what's ahead
of us anyway.

98
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:36,242
What? It's none of your business.

99
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,054
Mind your own business.

100
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:41,292
Suk Jin! Come out! Come out!

101
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:46,318
- Gary!
- Okay I'm coming.

102
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,290
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

103
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,529
What's a Sea-plane?

104
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,583
Bread on the sea?

105
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,568
Pretzel?

106
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:06,551
- That's plain! Not plane.
- Yogurt.

107
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:09,233
What are you talking about?

108
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,931
- Go to the back, Jae Suk.
- Huh? We're the third place.

109
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,286
Suk Jin isn't here.

110
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,193
Isn't a Jeep the best in waters?

111
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:24,985
There may be two Jeeps because
it's the best choice.

112
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:28,109
Why are you so early?

113
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:31,818
- I think the sea-plane is the best.
- You can't let them see it.

114
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,282
You have to make blind picks.

115
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:37,998
Flip them and make them make
blind picks.

116
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:43,860
Let's depend on luck.

117
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,877
I picked it! Let's go.

118
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,537
- Did you pick a Jeep?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,418
I think it's the right choice.

120
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:58,403
- Be creative about it.
- We pick a Jeep too.

121
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,624
Give it up for me.

122
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,181
It's Gary's birthday.

123
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:08,302
Happy birthday to you.

124
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,750
Give us the Jeep for my birthday.

125
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,562
We got second place.
Wait! Shouldn't we get to pick?

126
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,812
Which one do you want Jae Suk?

127
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:20,852
Sea-plane? You don't think
it spins in the air, do you?

128
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,532
No way.

129
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,921
Because I really can't do
stuff like that.

130
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:27,352
You can't do anything!

131
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,606
Gosh! Why did you pick me?

132
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:34,611
It was between you and Ha Ha.

133
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,902
I was cornered too.
I had no choice.

134
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,688
I would have picked Ji Hoon
or Woo Bin if they were available.

135
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:44,606
Did you have to say that?
Cornered?

136
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,469
You have to destroy their
team chemistry.

137
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:56,636
Like, you have to go to Team A
and bond with them first.

138
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:59,004
Then go to Team B and do
something else.

139
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:02,566
Ji Hoon did a lot yesterday,
but I gave most of the orders.

140
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,869
- Really.
- Really?

141
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:11,201
I have to get my revenge
on Jong Kook.

142
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,646
He got even bulkier.

143
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,234
His weakness is the pit of
his stomach.

144
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:21,084
- Hit him there?
- Hit him there.

145
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:23,306
You have to elbow it.

146
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,612
Just say that you're sorry.

147
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,612
I did it often. I really did.

148
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,874
<i>[South Stradbroke Island
located in the northern Gold Coast.]</i>

149
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:44,711
<i>[The biggest forest in Australian Gold Coast
with wooden forests and sand hills.]</i>

150
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,451
<i>[Australian Adventure- Second Day]</i>

151
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,498
[Team Running Man arrived in McLarens.]

152
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,945
It's really an island.

153
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,697
If you and your partner has more than
900 ml of water after the beach race...

154
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:06,594
- You may get out.
- What does this mean?

155
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,843
I think we have to drive with
a cup in our car.

156
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,449
So we try not to spill water.

157
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,782
Let's go.

158
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,360
Do we just go?

159
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,486
So we got here first right?

160
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,671
No?

161
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,776
I can't believe this.

162
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,223
You're always late.

163
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:33,101
It wasn't us.
The plane came late.

164
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,888
It wasn't us.

165
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,984
It was you!

166
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,835
- Hello.
- Good morning.

167
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:45,516
- Here's your mission.
- Mission.

168
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:50,885
The person on the boat needs to answer seven
quiz questions given by the person parasailing.

169
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,936
What is parasailing?

170
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,791
There's a big chute.
You go up in the air.

171
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,658
Up? The parachute?

172
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:02,787
And we have to give and answer
seven quiz questions in a minute?

173
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,942
Wait, so one of us has to go
on the chute?

174
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,097
You! It's my birthday.

175
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:23,791
- Congratulations.
- Wait.

176
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:25,962
Thank you!

177
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:30,052
Good morning.

178
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,790
Here's your mission.

179
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:35,734
String 15 beads while flying
on a sea-plane.

180
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,953
Suk Jin!

181
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:42,277
We have to string 15 beads.

182
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:44,506
We're in trouble.

183
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:51,040
<i>[Australian Adventure McLarens.
Succeed on a sea-plane, parasail, or jeep.]</i>

184
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:55,049
Wow.

185
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,343
[Deep woods.]

186
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,113
We're lucky that it's not too hot.

187
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,280
This is... wow.

188
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:18,363
There you go. Go!

189
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,891
Amazing!

190
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:32,029
Look at the sea.

191
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,237
I feel like we're on vacation.

192
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,247
Dang!

193
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,751
It's amazing.

194
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:57,419
Everyone! Australia is beautiful.
Australia is very beautiful.

195
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,727
I love Australia!

196
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:04,461
I love Hoju Hosu!
(Australian lake)

197
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,901
Ha Ha, it's seven questions per minute.
Make it quick. I will answer them.

198
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:13,072
- It's already decided?
- Of course.

199
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,759
It was decided at five in the morning.

200
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:17,705
Why?

201
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,544
My birthday.

202
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:25,709
- I will give you something else.
- No, I want this.

203
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,237
- It's over when we get back to Korea.
- Call.

204
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,941
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah!

205
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:34,325
You're a great man.

206
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:36,973
I gave the best birthday present ever.

207
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:39,509
I will get it right quickly.
Don't worry.

208
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:48,565
I think you have to string both of them.

209
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,711
Have the younger ones do this.

210
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,670
It's hard enough to escort
this old man.

211
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,128
The kids who need to be on this
are on the Jeeps.

212
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,501
This makes no sense.

213
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,105
Let's wake up early.
Why take forever?

214
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:07,158
And stop pretending that you're
running with your upper body.

215
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:10,397
You always do this
while you're walking.

216
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,160
You saw it.

217
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,411
He's quick.

218
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,698
You always make this motion
when you're really walking.

219
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:19,599
I woke up only a few hours ago.

220
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:23,335
I'll do better!
Cheer up!

221
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:25,464
I'll do better.

222
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,482
We're in trouble.

223
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,585
What should I do?

224
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,670
Really? Are you the driver?

225
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:47,385
- No, no, no good driver.
- No, no, no, very bad.

226
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,248
We're leaving!

227
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,546
- Oh my God!
- We're leaving.

228
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:03,371
I only saw this in the movies.

229
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,619
This is some 007 stuff.

230
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:10,980
- Just focus on your beads.
- Okay.

231
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:18,074
You only see this in movies.

232
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,096
Wait, wait.

233
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,013
This is impossible.

234
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:46,123
I'm almost on my back.

235
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:53,814
Why is it so fast?

236
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:06,575
Why is it skidding?

237
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,192
This doesn't feel good at all!

238
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:43,920
[We're adventuring in McLarens from the
land, sea, and air at the same time.]

239
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,499
I love Australia.

240
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,874
I'm becoming one with nature.

241
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,789
<i>[Stay out of the shot for
a sec, Kwang Soo.]</i>

242
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,277
<i>[It's a photo shoot.]</i>

243
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:32,229
<i>[You're gorgeous too... or cute.]</i>

244
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,757
What's going on?

245
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,838
How's this even possible?

246
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:59,644
The mission to the team that
woke up first is...

247
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:05,496
This is the start line and it's divided
into three sections, R1, R2, and R3.

248
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:07,173
They are connected.

249
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,848
- I will give you a water cup.
- Wait one sec.

250
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:12,949
Wasn't it this?
I thought it was this.

251
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,313
I thought it this one would be okay.

252
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,523
I will give you 500 ml each.

253
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:22,217
You must keep 900 ml in aggregate
after the first section, R1.

254
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,989
500 ml? Then 100 ml?

255
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,092
Yes, you cannot spill more than 100ml.

256
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:32,328
- So if we fail, we have to try again for R2?
- Correct.

257
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:37,144
- Jae Suk is going.
- It's Jae Suk!

258
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,716
There's water right below us.

259
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:05,011
What's he doing?
What's he doing?

260
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:10,053
We're falling.

261
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,408
- We will not start the mission.
- No! No!

262
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,845
It started!

263
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:54,263
I knew it!
I knew this would happen.

264
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,508
What's up with the up and downs?

265
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,377
You have to tilt it in the
opposite direction of the car.

266
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,057
You have to tilt it.

267
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:51,679
Opposite! There you go.

268
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:57,797
Good! I think I can get it.

269
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:06,474
This is swerving way too much.

270
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:17,199
No! No!

271
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:22,597
Okay.

272
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,319
Wait! I'm still okay.

273
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,122
I'm still okay.

274
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:46,175
We're one with the car.

275
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:50,779
Don't think about it.

276
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:53,135
We have to tilt it along with the car.

277
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,314
That's cold.

278
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:09,524
I'm okay.

279
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:12,072
I'm still okay.

280
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,598
Hey! I'm good.

281
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:20,757
It's close.

282
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:25,734
- This isn't enough is it?
- Is this?

283
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,152
This is worse than roller coasters.

284
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:48,112
How can we string them?

285
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:50,552
This is impossible.

286
00:24:51,277 --> 00:24:54,504
- I couldn't get any.
- How can you not get any?

287
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,074
Gosh! What were you doing?

288
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,349
- Do something!
- Okay.

289
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:08,630
You have to keep on working.
First hold it.

290
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,155
Careful! You have to be careful!

291
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:38,580
You should be laughing right now.

292
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,347
Don't do anything.
Don't say anything.

293
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,363
Let's try one by one.

294
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,749
It needs to exceed the line.

295
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:11,552
Let's try one first.

296
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,542
This won't be enough.

297
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,649
- I thought it'd be enough.
- It wasn't enough.

298
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,141
I'm sorry, Woo Bin!

299
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,251
It's cold.

300
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,789
You think we have enough?

301
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:46,413
- No cheating!
- I won't. You don't have enough anyway.

302
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:51,658
Woo Bin! You did well.

303
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:57,701
- Will this be enough?
- No way.

304
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:03,718
It's raining!

305
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:06,832
Isn't rain going to energize Rain?

306
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,007
Ji Hoon is getting energy.

307
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,159
You've failed R1.

308
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:22,428
- Is it 850 this time?- I will try it.

309
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:24,546
Let's go for 900 ml one more time.

310
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:27,411
- Just once.
- Are you out of your mind?

311
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:29,484
- Just once.
- Are you out of your mind?

312
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:31,053
Why?

313
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:34,276
Trust me, I have a plan.

314
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:37,685
Let's go for 850.

315
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:39,787
Right?

316
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,685
And can you stop trying to be smart?

317
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:46,079
You guys won't get anywhere anyway.

318
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,215
Not you guys. Just him.

319
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,717
Yeah, I'm sorry.

320
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:55,740
Kwang Soo! We have the advantage
from the rain. So let's go.

321
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,247
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

322
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:59,826
So only Kwang Soo is doing it?

323
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,394
Can I have a cup of water?

324
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:07,009
Let's get going after this.

325
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:15,831
Kwang Soo!
You have something in your mouth.

326
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:18,914
I drank some water.

327
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:24,140
I got caught.

328
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:32,359
- I got caught.
- Okay, okay.

329
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:16,183
Aren't you going to talk?

330
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,974
We have high wakes.

331
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:26,785
How are we going to speed up
in this?

332
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,346
Unless you have to stand up, stay seated.
It's rough okay?

333
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,781
If you're feeling sick, look at the shore.

334
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:42,567
No wonder they wanted us
to take sea sick meds.

335
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:46,383
We have to get it right at once.
We have no other choice.

336
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,635
You're good at explaining.

337
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,938
I'm good at guessing.

338
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,193
But I'm bad at explaining.

339
00:29:56,183 --> 00:30:00,254
This is really scary. Oh my God.
This is no joke!

340
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:10,846
What is this?

341
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,878
Can we do it here?

342
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,017
Are we getting on that boat?

343
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:21,602
So let's board one person at a time.
He's on the parasailing boat.

344
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:27,173
Go, go, go.

345
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:02,264
Everyone just sit down. We have a
little problem with the boat.

346
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:15,751
[Are we going to be okay?]

347
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:19,056
In the middle of the ocean. Yeah.

348
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:26,776
Okay! Sit tight.
It's very very rough.

349
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:31,287
We cannot do the parasailing.
It's too rough in the ocean today.

350
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,441
Maybe next time. But not today.
Too rough.

351
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:38,913
Oh my lord.

352
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:49,066
Let's go to the inside coast.
Inside.

353
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,248
Calm area.

354
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:14,347
- We drank it from here.
- It was tactics.

355
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:20,054
It's more than we started with.

356
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,172
Is it my saliva in there?

357
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:26,977
Hey! You have more water
than you started with.

358
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,391
He has more water!

359
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,305
He has more water.

360
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,895
- How did you get more water?
- No one gave us any.

361
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:36,092
- What the heck?
- Let's go.

362
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,183
Look. Look.

363
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:41,279
- No one gave us water.
- Look at the line.

364
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,749
- You have more water.
- It's called tactics.

365
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,737
I got some rain water.

366
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,101
Is that how you want to play?
We're not going home then.

367
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,106
You know I can get dirty.

368
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:03,578
Okay! We made it.

369
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,515
Give us an explanation.

370
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:11,138
We had water in our mouths.

371
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:15,954
Okay, we will let it go. The part with
you carrying water in your mouth.

372
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:24,362
Did you put in more water
other than the one I gave you?

373
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:27,238
40 million Koreans are watching you.

374
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,072
- We will do it again.
- I didn't.

375
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,141
I wanted to drink the water
from the cup.

376
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,521
Woo Bin can get dirtier than me.

377
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:39,201
He asked to drink some water.

378
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:42,929
Then he put back the water in his mouth.

379
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:46,334
Kwang Soo wanted to do it too.
But then Ji Hoon saw him.

380
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,269
Yeah, I swallowed it.

381
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:54,999
Since we have to save water,
we will use this water again.

382
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:58,076
It's not like I can't do it.

383
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,438
Do you want new water Woo Bin?

384
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:05,437
Why special treatment for Woo Bin?
I'm going to throw this on you.

385
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,776
What did you just say?

386
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,768
Pay respect to the crew.

387
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:14,588
- Give me fresh water.
- We need to conserve water.

388
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:17,325
Give me fresh water!

389
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:21,943
Why do I have to string beads
on a plane?

390
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,357
How do we do this?

391
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,665
Stop! Dropping.

392
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,959
What is wrong with him?

393
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:51,564
One more! One! One!

394
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:54,311
Accomplished.

395
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,349
Hurry up.

396
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:05,573
Why isn't this working?

397
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:09,275
- I have 15.
- Count mine.

398
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:11,901
What is this?

399
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:14,988
You need to do four more.

400
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,345
- Hurry up!
- Stop tugging.

401
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,791
<i>[10 minutes later.]</i>

402
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:31,045

404
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:52,954
<i>[Oh yeah, fun enough to die.]</i>

405
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:47,358
- You have more water.
- No. I really didn't cheat.

406
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,432
We got it this time.
Something is wrong if we don't get it.

407
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:54,271
The water is so hot.
We can cook ramen in this.

408
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,001
We got it. I think we got it.

409
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:06,404
Go!

410
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:09,329
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

411
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:17,092
Congratulations.

412
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:19,615
We got it too.

413
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:27,446
- We got it!
- Thank you!

414
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,871
We shared our plan.

415
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,490
Dolphins! Get it!

416
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,007
Dolphins.

417
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:49,100
Where did it go?

418
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,364
Over there!

419
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,280
Hi dolphins!

420
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,080
They aren't sharks are they?

421
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,768
- Dolphin!
- We didn't do anything.

422
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:04,451
Let's get dolphins at least.
Over there! Our friends.

423
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,530
Let's name our friends.
Gary and Ha Ha.

424
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,613
Gary and Ha Ha!

425
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,782
Hi dolphins!

426
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:16,544
Hi Gary!

427
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,622
Dolphin!

428
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,772
Dolphins!

429
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:34,827
Are they gone? I think they left.

430
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:43,470
You came back first.

431
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,738
We almost died.
We deserve first place.

432
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:48,100
It was really close.

433
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:52,039
What is it?
Do we have to do something?

434
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:56,556
- You won first place. Did you forget?
- I never got to win first place with him.

435
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:00,694
Oh yeah!
We get to ask questions.

436
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:03,913
So this is our reward.

437
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,254
Am I water?

438
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:11,204
Correct.

439
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:13,846
I'm water.

440
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,411
- Am I fire?
- Fire?

441
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:19,289
Correct.

442
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,852
You and I are water and fire.

443
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:27,593
I'm water and you're fire.

444
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:30,565
We are the opposite.

445
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,486
I knew it.

446
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,957
Second place?

447
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,414
We get to ask,
'Do we have blank in us?'

448
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:47,141
Of the four elements, is
Earth among us?

449
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,454
Earth is not among you.

450
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,742
- I'm not earth.
- That was a decisive question.

451
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:00,282
Let me tell you.

452
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:05,498
First, I won first place twice yesterday.

453
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,213
I had the chance to ask them twice.

454
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:13,072
I was not water or fire.

455
00:40:13,593 --> 00:00:08,159
So I'm not earth either.

456
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:20,660
Then I'm likely wind.

457
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,408
- What again?
- Another plane?

458
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:33,012
This again?

459
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:36,057
We got last place again.

460
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,216
We're going to Melbourne.
We're going again.

461
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:42,380
- We're going to Melbourne?
- Again?

462
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:55,706
- Melbourne!
- I love Melbourne!

463
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,418
Melbourne!

464
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:03,349
I will tell you the last mission
of your Australia Adventure.

465
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,227
Water, fire, wind, and earth.

466
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:13,742
Collect all four elements and
put it on the final altar.

467
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,105
And the treasure will awaken.

468
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:23,963
The important thing is that you only need
one person on your team on the altar to win.

469
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:27,444
Okay.

470
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:32,122
We will pick starting with the first place.

471
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,889
Pick one.

472
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,796
<i>[Take a taxi to the following address.]</i>

473
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:47,361
<i>Hello.</i>

474
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:09,288
So only one of us needs to
be on the altar to win.

475
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,507
Let's really want it this time.

476
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,901
- Have you seen 'The Fifth Element'?
- I have.

477
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:20,720
It's just like that.
'The Fifth Element'.

478
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,328
Huh?

479
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:25,795
They put water, fire, wind, and
earth on the altar.

480
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:29,336
And the fifth element is the girl.

481
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:32,448
And it opens the door.
It's just like that.

482
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:34,059
Right?

483
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,528
It's 'The Fifth Element'.

484
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:41,764
You think Ji Hyo is here
as the fifth element?

485
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:46,673
We have to take Ji Hyo.

I'm here in Melbourne.

492
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:47,254
I just got here after a 13 hour flight.

493
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,052
I arrived in Melbourne.

494
00:43:49,052 --> 00:43:51,776
I'm not groomed.
I'm sorry.

495
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:54,773
I look shaggy.

496
00:43:55,236 --> 00:44:00,177

I'm lonely here.

Go to the mission restaurant and
eat to obtain the Earth Card.

499
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:11,937
Collect three Earth Cards...

500
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:19,049
and become one of the four
elements of Earth, earth.

00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:23,999
I'm human and I have to
become earth?

502
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:28,931
What does this mean? I have to
collect three Earth Cards?

503
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:33,482
The Running Men are three of the four.

504
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,645
Water, fire, and wind.

505
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,227
Remember when I said four?

506
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:40,726
They need earth.

507
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:44,459
- You're the earth.
- I am?

508
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:46,455
Only you are.

509
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:48,393
They need all four elements to
find the treasure.

510
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,813
You're the only earth element.

511
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:55,114
But you're incomplete earth.

512
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:59,377
So you need to go to the mission
restaurants in Melbourne.

513
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:04,401
And finish all the food there.

514
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:10,543
You will obtain your Earth Cards
from that.

515
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:14,316
- Collect the Earth Cards.
- And become complete Earth.

516

518
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:27,631

I'm hungry.

520
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:34,515
If you run into Running Members they
may steal your card. So be careful.

01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:22,850
Which way should I go?

711
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:27,538
There are two teams over there.
I don't know which is which.

712
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:32,547
I saw two teams in the
restaurant and I ran out here.

713
01:03:40,944 --> 01:03:43,105
I want to drink coffee in a
place like this.

714
01:03:45,102 --> 01:03:48,337
<i>[Famous street with
European cafes and restaurants.]</i>

715
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:56,131
The point is to drink a relaxing coffee here.
But I feel like I'm being chased.

716
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,354
I have two Earth Cards.
I just need one more.

717
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,162
[Australian Americano,
long black's unique taste.]

718
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:13,136
I'm finished.

719
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,599
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

720
01:04:18,008 --> 01:04:21,774
The last card to make me
become Earth.

721
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,392
I have become earth.

722
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:38,961
<i>First earth element of
four elements of the Earth.</i>

723
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:44,261
Find Song Ji Hyo, the woman
of Earth, doing missions in Melbourne.

724
01:04:44,526 --> 01:04:46,557
Ji Hyo is here.

725
01:04:46,557 --> 01:04:51,006
You need to find her and
put her on the altar.

726
01:04:51,776 --> 01:04:53,494
Find her?

727
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:58,091
- The goddess of earth is...
- We are fire.

728
01:04:58,719 --> 01:04:59,992
Wind.

729
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:02,706
We need to find Ji Hyo.
She's earth.

730
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:04,999
She's earth.

731
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:09,251
Now that I'm complete earth,
I can walk with my head high.

732
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:11,759
We need to find Ji Hyo.

733
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:13,740
How are we going to find Ji Hyo?

734
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:21,006
Oh no.

735
01:05:21,535 --> 01:05:23,902
We have the crowd coming.

736
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:33,265
Sorry!

737
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:36,361
How are we going to find Ji Hyo?

738
01:05:43,704 --> 01:05:46,002
Where is she?

739
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:55,618
Do you have Ji Hyo's number?

740
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,975
Yeah, I need to call her.

741
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:09,677
Where are we going to find Ji Hyo?

742
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:12,437
We need to find her.
Where should we find her?

743
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,850
But can we shoot here?

744
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:18,565
Yeah, we don't want anyone
to get hurt.

745
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,838
<i>[Due to safety issues, we
had to cancel street shooting.]</i>

746
01:06:31,262 --> 01:06:33,176
I sent a text.

747
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:40,230
If you are successful, then come
to the Royal Exhibition.

748
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:43,984
If you are successful, then come
to the Royal Exhibition.

749
01:06:43,984 --> 01:06:46,820
I have become complete earth.
You need to find me.

750
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,970
Hehe.

751
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,081
-  We need to find her.
- Okay.

752
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,547
How are we going to find Ji Hyo?

753
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:55,988
This is hard.

754
01:07:13,827 --> 01:07:15,867
[The Royal Exhibition]

755
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:21,573
<i>[Ji Hyo got here first.]</i>

756
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,495
It's huge.

757
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:39,572
<i>[This is where the treasure lies.]</i>

758
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:58,508
What do we do now?
I'm complete.

759
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:02,820
The other members need to
find their cards.

760
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,977
Then I just need to wait?

761
01:08:06,443 --> 01:08:08,810
Since you joined late today...

762
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,068
I feel like a princess today.

763
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,142
It's so high.

764
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:19,268
- Song Ji Hyo!
- She's over there.

765
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,476
Ji Hyo!

766
01:08:22,476 --> 01:08:24,719
Finding me is not what's important.

767
01:08:25,241 --> 01:08:27,433
It's not about finding me.

768
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:30,863
You need to find out which
elements you are.

769
01:08:32,452 --> 01:08:37,108
Find your card with your
name in the Royal Exhibition.

770
01:08:38,043 --> 01:08:39,452
Complete the four elements.

771
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:42,222
And step up on the altar.

772
01:08:46,254 --> 01:08:47,911
We know which elements we are.

773
01:08:48,178 --> 01:08:50,412
- Then go find the cards.
- We need to find the cards?

774
01:08:50,412 --> 01:08:52,536
Whose side are you on?
Are you helping someone?

775
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:55,304
I have become the complete earth.

776
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,632
- She's the earth.
- She is.

777
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,386
Then...

778
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:03,703
Like I said you need to hurry up.

779
01:09:04,684 --> 01:09:07,444
It's the goddess of earth.

780
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,766
Which cards do you have?

781
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,424
- Fire.
- Fire.

782
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:17,200
Then if Jong Kook is water,
we need to find the Water Card.

783
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:19,040
Yes.

784
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,145
So I need to carry all three cards
and go up on the altar with Ji Hyo.

785
01:09:23,712 --> 01:09:26,074
- Ji Hyo!
- Hurry up!

786
01:09:26,074 --> 01:09:27,820
Ji Hyo!

787
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,036
- Kwang Soo!
- Ji Hyo!

788
01:09:30,036 --> 01:09:32,027
How are you?

789
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:36,513
- Hi.
- Hi.

790
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:40,745
You need the cards you won.

791
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:44,499
The person who gets up on the
altar with me wins.

792
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:46,241
I'm the earth.

793
01:09:46,656 --> 01:09:48,616
Help us.
Be on our side.

794
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:50,369
I'm neutral.

795
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,353
So we can steal earth from Ji Hyo?

796
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:56,724
I was just wondering.
I didn't get the rules yet.

797
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:58,869
Do you know how important I am?

798
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:02,471
The mission depends on
who I go to.

799
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:04,820
I'm going to leave you out if
you don't behave.

800
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,030
Okay! I was just kidding.
Woo Bin is here.

801
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:09,441
You need to escort Ji Hyo to the altar.

802
01:10:09,888 --> 01:10:12,588
- I'm sorry.
- You little punk!

803
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:16,569
The first thing you think about after
I got to Melbourne is ripping me off?

804
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,175
Find your cards first.

805
01:10:25,524 --> 01:10:27,236
Watch out.

806
01:10:27,718 --> 01:10:30,541
We just need to find water and fire.

807
01:10:30,923 --> 01:10:32,679
We just need to find water and
fire and get up on the altar.

808
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:36,180
Not many guys know which
element they are.

809
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:38,123
- Really?
- Not many do.

810
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,538
Let's look in here.

811
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,141
Is it first floor only?

812
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:49,819
It's obviously not a place that's
too visible.

813
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,994
We have to find one as soon as possible.

814
01:10:55,557 --> 01:11:01,226
Check the pillars.
Find them quickly.

815
01:11:08,263 --> 01:11:10,047
<i>[Found an envelope.]</i>

816
01:11:13,655 --> 01:11:17,369
It's mine.

817
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:26,425
- Did you find it?
- No.

818
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:29,345
You look like you found it.

819
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:32,740
- Is it ours?
- It's mine.

820
01:11:33,764 --> 01:11:35,244
Dang!

821
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:37,872
You're so cool.

822
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:40,085
Let's hurry up.
Ji Hoon!

823
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:42,511
- Which ones did we get?
- It's fire and wind.

824
01:11:42,854 --> 01:11:45,273
We just need to find water.

825
01:11:46,662 --> 01:11:47,775
We have wind and fire.

826
01:11:48,342 --> 01:11:50,357
We just need to find water.

827
01:11:51,584 --> 01:11:53,866
Find water! It's not
in the trash can.

828
01:11:54,617 --> 01:11:57,217
Everyone! This is an emergency.

829
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,954
Ji Hoon found his own card.

830
01:12:00,307 --> 01:12:01,944
- Who did?
- Ji Hoon.

831
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,847
- He found his own card.
- Oh no.

832
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,724
We have to distract them.

833
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,708
Distract Team Blue.

834
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:14,469
Woo Bin! You find the cards.
I will stop Ji Hoon.

835
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:16,647
It's over when Jong Kook finds it.

836
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,127
We have to find it.

837
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,526
<i>[This envelope is Ha Ha's.]</i>

838
01:12:39,362 --> 01:12:41,573
<i>[Gary found one. And it's his!]</i>

839
01:12:45,316 --> 01:12:48,892
I'm going to check if it's mine.

840
01:12:49,416 --> 01:12:51,308
<i>[Gary and Ha Ha are both fire.]</i>

841
01:12:52,086 --> 01:12:54,221
<i>[So they need to find a Water Card to win.]</i>

842
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:57,466
- Who is it?
- We're in trouble.

843
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,496
- I found all of ours.
- All of them?

844
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,008
Really? Dang!

845
01:13:03,325 --> 01:13:06,950
- We need to find water.
- We need to find water.

846
01:13:08,442 --> 01:13:11,441
We just need to find water.

847
01:13:11,918 --> 01:13:13,973
Then no one can beat us.

848
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:17,287
Then we can win!
This is crazy.

849
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:20,451
We just need to find water.

850
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,255
<i>[So obvious]</i>

851
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,336
What are you doing?

852
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:41,372
Hey this isn't coming out.
It's here, but I can't get it.

853
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:43,837
It's here. Jae Suk!

854
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:48,035
- Jae Suk!
- Woo Bin!

855
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,651
What? What?

856
01:13:50,651 --> 01:13:52,842
Jae Suk! Stop Ji Hoon.

857
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:55,262
- How did you find this?
- I did.

858
01:13:55,262 --> 01:13:57,232
You should have been discrete!

859
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:00,139
I tried to be discrete,
but it wouldn't come out.

860
01:14:01,264 --> 01:14:03,065
Can you do anything right?

861
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:05,483
It keeps on going in.
It's all the way in now.

862
01:14:05,492 --> 01:14:08,214
Don't we have to use a tool now?

863
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,943
How did you push this in?

864
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:12,469
- It's not coming out.
- Go find something else.

865
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,078
I'm so tired.

866
01:14:22,341 --> 01:14:24,029
[Rain found an envelope behind
the camera.]

867
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,638
Ji Hoon! Where are you going?

868
01:14:33,327 --> 01:14:35,771
<i>[It's Kwang Soo's,
who is right behind him.]</i>

869
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:39,883
- Did you find it?
- Stop following me.

870
01:14:40,318 --> 01:14:42,271
Ji Hoon found a card!

871
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:44,334
Ji Hoon found a card!

872
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:47,164
Ji Hoon found a card!

873
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:50,668
- I said stop following me.
- I'm sorry.

874
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:01,635
What are you doing?

875
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:09,742
<i>There is an important rule
that you cannot forget.</i>

876
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:13,412
<i>When you find someone else's card.</i>

877
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:17,534
<i>Take off the name tag of the
envelope's owner.</i>

878
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:21,417
<i>Then you may win the card
inside the envelope.</i>

879
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:27,323
What are you doing?

880
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,238
Can I open it now?

881
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:33,500
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

882
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,398
Is it mine?

883
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:42,235
Woo Bin, you have to find the
rest on your own.

884
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:47,897
<i>[Kwang Soo and Rain are both wind.]</i>

885
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:50,530
It's someone else's wind.
Hide it.

886
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:52,817
Put it in your pocket.

887
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:07,901
<i>[Ha Ha and Gary need water.]</i>

888
01:16:11,509 --> 01:16:12,797
I found it.

889
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:16,468
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk]</i>

890
01:16:18,113 --> 01:16:20,297
I found one more.
I found Jae Suk's.

891
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:24,092
We have to rip the name tag.

892
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:26,310
Then we can take whatever
Jae Suk has.

893
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:28,884
He's our target now.

894
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,494
If you have the envelope,
then you have to rip the name tag.

895
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:33,906
- No, you have to do it.
- I have to do it?

896
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,583
Be my decoy.

897
01:16:39,032 --> 01:16:41,766
Hey go!

898
01:16:42,406 --> 01:16:46,223
He's coming. Go!

899
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:51,203
- He's coming.
- I will protect you.

900
01:16:54,752 --> 01:16:57,586
Jong Kook!

901
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:06,661
I got it off.

902
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:13,562
I couldn't find any envelopes.

903
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:20,425
- Water... please water.
- Fire!

904
01:17:21,414 --> 01:17:24,054
- Fire!
- We have all the fire cards.

905
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:26,101
You have fire, I have fire.

906
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:37,791
Woo Bin! Come here.

907
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:40,821
- Come here.
- Let me tell you something important.

908
01:17:42,183 --> 01:17:43,865
Neither of you can win.

909
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:45,862
You can't win.

910
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:49,595
Then help us. And we will
share the winnings with you.

911
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:53,114
Really? Which card do you need?

912
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:55,588
We just need water.

913
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:58,495
Water? I'm water.

914
01:17:58,771 --> 01:18:00,547
I'm water.

915
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:04,199
Then we just need to get yours.

916
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:06,700
But why can't he and I win?

917
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,975
You can't! There's no fire.

918
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,196
You and I need to team up.

919
01:18:11,215 --> 01:18:13,894
- There is no fire.
- Then we need to take it from whoever has it.

920
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:16,007
There is no fire.
You can't take it off.

921
01:18:16,828 --> 01:18:18,853
You want all three of us to team up?

922
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:23,020
I have one fire card.
Jong Kook.

923
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,166
- I have fire.
- How's that possible?

924
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:28,117
I got it from the mission.

925
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,813
Then he can win.

926
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,556
- You got it from the mission?
- He still has the possibility.

927
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:37,213
Then I also have a possibility.

928
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,570
- Jong Kook!
- Why did he reveal it?

929
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:41,552
He's too naive.

930
01:18:41,552 --> 01:18:43,972
Are you stupid?
Why did you reveal it?

931
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:46,836
- I've never seen anyone like him.
- You're so cool.

932
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:51,618
You should have pretended that you have
no chance and betrayed us later.

933
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:56,591
That was a big upset in the game.
You know you just gave that up.

934
01:18:56,591 --> 01:18:59,264
I couldn't even imagine.

935
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:02,618
It would have been hard for me anyway.

936
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:10,682
<i>[He hides the fire card.]</i>

937
01:19:41,392 --> 01:19:42,895
It's Jong Kook's.

938
01:19:49,473 --> 01:19:52,627
<i>[In the right shoe this time.]</i>

939
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,351
There are so many places to hide.

940
01:20:01,732 --> 01:20:04,955
- Wow Running Man is no joke.
- Woo Bin.

941
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:08,905
- Which one do you need? I will help you.
- Water and wind.

942
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,331
Water and wind?

943
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:12,102
I have fire.

944
01:20:12,326 --> 01:20:14,721
- You have water right?
- No.

945
01:20:14,721 --> 01:20:16,618
I will find you wind.

946
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:19,885
- Then I find just water?
- You need to find water.

947
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:23,243
But what good is finding it?
We can't beat Jong Kook.

948
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:25,762
- I will help you.
- I can't trust you.

949
01:20:28,614 --> 01:20:31,529
He trusts me. When you find the
water card, give it to me.

950
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:34,472
- Then I will just snatch it from him.
- I can't trust you.

951
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:38,502
- Woo Bin!
- I'm on my own now.

952
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:40,264
You have to use me.

953
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:46,337
- Which one do you have?
- I have nothing. That's why I'm searching.

954
01:20:47,196 --> 01:20:49,643
Then I would have ripped
the name tag.

955
01:20:49,643 --> 01:20:51,795
I have fire.

956
01:20:52,906 --> 01:20:56,385
I bet Rain has wind.

957
01:20:57,097 --> 01:20:59,226
Obviously Jong Kook needs water.

958
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,448
Take the wind card.

959
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:03,451
Then rip Jong Kook off.

960
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,727
I mean find the water card first.

961
01:21:07,484 --> 01:21:09,072
Then I will share the winnings with you.

962
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:11,119
- Help me.
- Okay.

963
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:13,532
- Can you do it?
- Of course.

964
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:14,964
I have fire and you have none.

965
01:21:14,964 --> 01:21:17,212
So my cut should be bigger.

966
01:21:17,212 --> 01:21:19,170
You're an Heir!

967
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:22,774
Act like an Heir!
You take the trophy.

968
01:21:22,774 --> 01:21:24,845
And I will take the gold.

969
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:27,110
Then let's do this.

970
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,590
Suk Jin...

971
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:33,192
It was 35 to 65.

972
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:36,524
But it's unlikely for us to beat Rain.

973
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:39,656
- We need all three.
- 30, 30, 30.

974
01:21:39,656 --> 01:21:42,882
30, 30, 40.

975
01:21:43,372 --> 01:21:46,245
You're an Heir!
No wonder you lost to Kim Tan.

976
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,008
We have 10 leftover.

977
01:21:48,102 --> 01:21:50,005
I have an offer from them too.

978
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:52,311
- We're a team!
- So what's my cut?

979
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:53,476
I will act according to my share.

980
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,037
25, 25, 25, 25.

981
01:21:56,549 --> 01:21:58,585
Okay, okay.
[One quarter including Gary.]

982
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,063
We're going to be obvious.
We have no choice.

983
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,012
Let's go over there.

984
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:24,860
- Did you find it?
- No.

985
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,633
That thing opens?
I had my arm stuck in it.

986
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:57,012
Did you find something?

987
01:22:58,731 --> 01:23:00,412
No?

988
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:02,253
Why aren't you telling me?

989
01:23:13,852 --> 01:23:15,356
He found it!

990
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:17,768
He found it!

991
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,364
Woo Bin!

992
01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:24,640
Wait Woo Bin!

993
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:35,251
<i>[That means Rain has Woo Bin's envelope?]</i>

994
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,417
What?

995
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:50,151
Is this right?

996
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:53,299
It's water.

997
01:23:55,143 --> 01:23:56,644
It's water.

998
01:23:56,644 --> 01:23:59,285
We have to stop them.
They've got it all.

999
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,661
I found them all.

1000
01:24:06,692 --> 01:24:08,607
It's lost.

1001
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:13,553
<i>[Jong Kook and Rain only need Ji Hyo.]</i>

1002
01:24:15,715 --> 01:24:19,759
Rain! Look at them. Oh no.

1003
01:24:20,316 --> 01:24:21,685
We have to stop them.

1004
01:24:22,054 --> 01:24:23,912
- Stick to them.
- This is like American football.

1005
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:30,032
Run Ji Hyo!

1006
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:32,456
Whoever wins, give me my share.

1007
01:24:34,772 --> 01:24:37,158
- Ji Hyo, run!
- Why is she running anyway?

1008
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:39,278
What? What?

1009
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:41,692
Why is she running?

1010
01:24:41,692 --> 01:24:44,222
I have my freedom of choice.
Did you find it or not?

1011
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:46,495
Gary, what's my share?

1012
01:24:46,509 --> 01:24:48,475
25, 25...

1013
01:24:48,475 --> 01:24:50,524
What's my share?

1014
01:24:52,745 --> 01:24:55,260
What? What? We have to go.

1015
01:25:00,107 --> 01:25:01,377
Why me? I'm a nobody!

1016
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:04,336
Hey! You can't stay there!

1017
01:25:10,993 --> 01:25:12,994
No! Gary!

1018
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:19,523
Water.

1019
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:28,182
Fire.

1020
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:34,430
Okay! Okay!

1021
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:44,813
Wind!

1022
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,854
<i>[Four elements complete]</i>

1023
01:25:58,542 --> 01:26:03,550
<i>[Water, fire, wind, and earth.
Four elements come together.]</i>

1024
01:26:04,555 --> 01:26:09,060
<i>[And finally awakens the hidden treasure.]</i>

1025
01:26:10,663 --> 01:26:14,740
Earth!

1026
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,115
I need my share, Rain!

1027
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:22,566
What do you mean?
You worked against us.

1028
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:24,529
He's not even funny.

1029
01:26:24,529 --> 01:26:26,387
- You were working against us.
- Keep your word.

1030
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,549
Give me my share.

1031
01:26:28,549 --> 01:26:30,521
- What is that?
- Is it this?

1032
01:26:30,847 --> 01:26:32,984
- This is all gold.
- Is it?

1033
01:26:33,514 --> 01:26:35,817
Yeah. It's all gold.

1034
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:37,772
Wow.

1035
01:26:38,204 --> 01:26:39,339
You can have this then.

1036
01:26:41,857 --> 01:26:44,020
- Let me see that.
- It's gold.

1037
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:51,889
I'm jealous.
Your girlfriend will be happy.

1038
01:26:53,204 --> 01:26:55,054
I'm jealous.
You've got it all.

1039
01:26:55,054 --> 01:26:56,999
You've got it all.

1040
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:58,295
You even took gold.

1041
01:26:58,295 --> 01:26:59,849
What about me?

1042
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:04,920
Anyway! Adventure Special.
The winner is...

1043
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,169
Kim Jong Kook and Jung Ji Hoon!

1044
01:27:09,922 --> 01:27:14,601
We came to Brisbane first
in Australia.

1045
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:17,591
And then the Gold Coast.

1046
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:20,474
- And here.
- Melbourne.

1047
01:27:20,839 --> 01:27:24,431
It was a long trip.

1048
01:27:24,902 --> 01:27:29,247
We'd like to thank our special guests
and others who have helped us.

1049
01:27:29,622 --> 01:27:32,526
Thank you!

1050
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:34,624
I love Australia.

1051
