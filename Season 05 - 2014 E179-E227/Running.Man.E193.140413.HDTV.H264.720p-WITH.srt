1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:05,773
[Last week- An adventure that took them
to the ends of the country.]

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,162
[A couple race where anything could
and did happen.]

3
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,983
[Haenam]

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,028
[A competition where no one
could predict the end.]

5
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:27,427
[The victors of the first day-
Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan.]

6
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:33,162
[And thus, the first day
comes to a close.]

7
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:37,364
[First night- 8 PM.
A cabin in Haenam.]

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,534
It started raining all of a sudden.

9
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:46,460
We were going to have our dinner
by the campfire.

10
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:51,380
I don't know about anything else,
but Min Jong won't get rid of his headphones.

11
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,983
These headphones are a
camping necessity.

12
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:57,735
- Really? Why?
- Of course.

13
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,875
What's the point of camping?
To embrace the nature outdoors, right?

14
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:06,317
[The baby faced man looks aged after
a full day of adventure in traveling.]

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,465
You look really exhausted.

16
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:13,426
We had to move the dinner indoors with
the sudden downpour of the rain.

17
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:17,926
- It really is raining pretty hard.
- We were hoping to have a campfire.

18
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,280
So we had to make some
sudden last minute changes.

19
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,220
Even though it's a bit of a tight squeeze,
we really hope that you enjoy your dinner.

20
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:26,666
[So the barbeque dinner is suddenly
transformed into an indoor cookout.]

21
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:30,710
Listen to that sizzling.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,621
This is the best part about camping.

23
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:39,891
- Now it feels like we're camping.
- Grilling is the best part of camping.

24
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:44,291
[The highlight of any campout?
The barbeque!]

25
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:47,635
Why does my face feel like it's burnt
when it's raining outside?

26
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:51,676
[One day is all it takes for this man's
skin to take on a deeper coffee hue.]

27
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,740
Just grilling the meat is making my skin
feel like it's burning.

28
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,166
That looks so good.

29
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,534
- You look like the owner of this place.
- What else can I get for you, Sir?

30
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,394
- You know how to speak Korean?
- I know how to speak a little bit.

31
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,052
I took the liberty of leaving some foil on
so that it'll help with your digestion.

32
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,995
Can you get me something for my eyes?
My eyes are starting to tear up.

33
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:21,051
[The hot coals...
bringing tears to my eyes.]

34
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:25,157
Make sure to eat your fill of it.
I'm sure you haven't had any meat in a while.

35
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,449
It's not easy to grill meat just
for yourself.

36
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,034
- You live alone?
- Yes.

37
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,064
[A single bachelor living alone,
Ryu Seung Soo.]

38
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,151
- You guys are really good at grilling.
- Does it taste okay?

39
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,156
It's really delicious.

40
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,189
- This is the best.
- Let's eat as much as we can.

41
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,339
[Finishing it off with a bowl of
spicy ramen.]

42
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:58,426
[20 servings of food disappears
in the blink of an eye.]

43
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,857
What are we doing tomorrow?

44
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,820
- How am I supposed to know that?
- You don't know?

45
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:07,782
It's because you want to go back to Seoul
if we're doing anything difficult, right?

46
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,869
[Cutting out in the middle of his very first
appearance on a variety show?]

47
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,138
- Did everyone enjoy their dinner?
- Yes.

48
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:21,294
We had everyone write down what they're
feeling earlier in secret, correct?

49
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:31,742
[A questionnaire which had them write down
what they truly felt...]

50
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:36,147
[about the person they were
partnered up with all day today.]

51
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,020
We will now take the time to read
your answers

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,233
and find out how you truly felt
about your partners.

53
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:48,635
Taking this opportunity to get to know
each other better and learn about each other

54
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,928
will be very beneficial to you during
your competitions tomorrow.

55
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,527
Since you were with
just your partners all day

56
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:56,417
I'm sure there are a lot of things that
you still may not know about other players.

57
00:03:57,283 --> 00:04:01,000
The person whom most people has said
that they want to be partnered up with is...

58
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:04,469
is Min Jong.

59
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,509
- He got a total of three votes.
- Congratulations.

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,519
And also... Seung Soo.

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,439
You can't keep peeking at
the answers.

62
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,865
- He must be very curious.
- I think he's very curious.

63
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,223
And in second place, we have a tie.

64
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:28,559
Dong Joon, Ji Hyo, and  Jong Kook.
They tied with two votes each.

65
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,350
Don't worry, you got a vote too.

66
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,918
- Did you write down your own name?
- And Kim Jung Nan.

67
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,751
- I don't have any? What the heck?
- You got zero votes.

68
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,699
Man Suk also has zero votes.

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,363
- Ha Ha and I also didn't get any votes.
- That's seriously very disappointing.

70
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,362
- Jung Nan really didn't get any votes?
- Suk Jin.

71
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:56,449
[Big-nose, are you really
going to be like this?]

72
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,329
Okay, I'll read what some of you wrote down
for your first impression of your partners.

73
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:03,413
- 'My partner is...'
- No, Jae Suk!

74
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,973
Is this you?

75
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,518
- Why are you acting all shy?
- This is supposed to be anonymous.

76
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,088
- This is all anonymous.
- Then this has to be Ji Hyo.

77
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,282
Other than a little awkwardness at first,
he's perfectly handsome

78
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,732
funny, kind, and a perfect partner
all around.

79
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:20,027
- It's nothing but positive things.
- Why not just tell him that you love him?

80
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,568
You purposely spoke up just so that he knows
you were talking about him, didn't you?

81
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,214
- I really didn't know this was anonymous.
- It is anonymous.

82
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,246
[Bitter]

83
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,991
'What was the most difficult moment
that you encountered with your partner?'

84
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>When I realized how enthusiastic
he can be.</i>

85
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,021
- Are you good at eating spicy foods?
- I really love spicy food.

86
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,876
I'll go first.
I can do that.

87
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:48,093
[Diving into missions without any fear...
Dong Joon's unending enthusiasm.]

88
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:50,965
All he has is his enthusiasm!

89
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:57,259
'If you could switch your partner'...
I can tell the initial answer was crossed out.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,511
<i>Kim Dong Joon.
I want to see how far his enthusiasm can go.</i>

91
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:01,631
What the heck is this?

92
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,561
- What are you doing?
- Why not tell him you love him?

93
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,620
[The inquisitive minds would like to know
what else she feels for the young man.]

94
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,469
- Look at how sad Gary looks right now!
- What are you doing?

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,591
Can you tell me who she initially wrote down
before she crossed out the name?

96
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:13,982
<i>Kim Dong...</i>

97
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:18,527
[The one and only Kim Dong Joon.]

98
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:22,052
<i>- 'First impression of your partner?'
- She's so beautiful and pretty. Very happy.</i>

99
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:29,467
I think you two must've had
too much fun!

100
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:33,294
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- This was a survey. It's not a love letter!

101
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,810
We were supposed to do this anonymously.
We weren't supposed to know who wrote what.

102
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,063
'What is your partner's one downfall?'

103
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:43,047
<i>Likes to sleep too much.
She pretty much slept all day.</i>

104
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:49,296
[Sleeps]

105
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,625
[Sleeps again]

106
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,763
[And sleeps some more.]

107
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,727
We all agree with you on that.

108
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,870
<i>I'm really happy with Ji Hyo
as my partner.</i>

109
00:06:57,871 --> 00:07:00,350
- He even wrote that he loves her.
- Love?

110
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,935
I'm really sorry.

111
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,919
Best of luck to you guys.

112
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,662
Let me see how some other people
answered these questions.

113
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:12,352
We keep reading the same people's answers.
Stop peeking at the answers.

114
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:19,371
[A very curious middle aged bachelor.]

115
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,659
<i>My first impression of my partner was that
she's very charismatic, and so dependable.</i>

116
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,792
Who could that be?

117
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,929
<i>Positives about my partner would be,
she's cute, affectionate, and has nice nails.</i>

118
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,361
[Sang Hwa's partner- Gary's survey.]

119
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:33,694
<i>My partner's downfall is that she
at times acts like a ferocious lion.</i>

120
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,672
'The most difficult moment that I've
experienced with my partner today?'

121
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:41,088
<i>Realizing that my thighs were skinnier and
weaker than hers was humiliating to my pride.</i>

122
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,506
That's not what I meant to say,
Sang Hwa.

123
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,310
I didn't get into the right position.

124
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,438
- Don't even think about falling down.
- Okay.

125
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,404
Sang Hwa, that's not really it.

126
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:07,575
<i>If I could trade my partner for anyone else,
then I would pick Song Ji Hyo.</i>

127
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,911
It's not me!

128
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,123
I feel so bad for him!

129
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:19,179
Okay, next survey.
'My partner's first impression?'

130
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,892
<i>He is like a scary looking guy
in my neighborhood.</i>

131
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:24,217
<i>My partner's downfall?
He keeps complaining that he's hungry.</i>

132
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,780
<i>He kept talking about
wanting to eat something.</i>

133
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,506
<i>I want to stay as Gary's partner.</i>

134
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:36,911
- I would choose Gary all over again.
- If I could turn back the time...

135
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,882
[Even her sense of loyalty is
gold medal worthy.]

136
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,529
'My partner's impression'...

137
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,572
What are you staring at?
Don't act like you weren't looking just now.

138
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,651
[His eyes automatically keep straying
to the survey sheets.]

139
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:57,733
<i>To be honest,
my first impression of my partner was...</i>

140
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,963
<i>he was much more ferocious looking than
his reputation deemed him to be.</i>

141
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,478
<i>But pretty soon,
I realized that I was mistaken</i>

142
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,250
<i>and if anything else,
that he and I were extremely compatible.</i>

143
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,495
<i>He proved to be coarse, mean,
and crass.</i>

144
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,988
<i>I found myself drawn to him as if
I had known him for most of my life.</i>

145
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,963
<i>He's a very warm person,
albeit a bit ugly.</i>

146
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:16,268
- What kind of an answer is this?
- Who is this?

147
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,631
Who wrote that?

148
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:23,292
<i>The best thing about my partner is that his
face kept getting darker even with the rain.</i>

149
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:26,615
[That would be none other than a survey
about Oh Man Suk.]

150
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,536
That's describing me right now!

151
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,118
- You're not the only one with dark skin.
- This is an anonymous survey.

152
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,484
- Why are you beating me?
- My skin got even more tan from grilling.

153
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,667
<i>My partner's downfall?
He's very ugly looking.</i>

154
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,446
<i>He's very ugly looking.</i>

155
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:44,150
<i>He's very nice,
but also very ugly looking.</i>

156
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,779
'The most difficult moment of the day?'

157
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,731
- I had to...
- The paper is blocking your face.

158
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,466
I'm just afraid that he's going
to peek again.

159
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,747
Stop looking at the survey!

160
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,484
<i>If I could trade my partner for anyone else,
I would choose Kim Min Jong.</i>

161
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,084
<i>Because he's good looking,
very good looking.</i>

162
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,050
[Kim Min Jong- Very good looking.]

163
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:07,046
That's a bit harsh!
Poor Man Suk.

164
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,825
- This is all anonymous!
- Yes, it is.

165
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,403
- It's anonymous.
- That's right.

166
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,220
'My first impression of my partner.'

167
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:17,096
<i>He was so warm, and I felt like I have known
him all my life even though I just met him.</i>

168
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:19,500
<i>He and I seem to be very similar
in character.</i>

169
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,822
<i>What I like about my partner is that he's
very positive</i>

170
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,509
<i>and he always seems to remain confident
no matter what the situation</i>

171
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,629
<i>as well as his unwavering sense of humor,
and we seem to be so well suited.</i>

172
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:30,996
<i>One negative about my partner is
his short stature.</i>

173
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,744
No matter what I try,
I keep planted pretty low to the ground.

174
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,297
<i>And I also feel nervous because I'm not sure
when he'll end up betraying me.</i>

175
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:42,176
<i>If I could swap out my partner for anyone
else then I'd like to choose Ji Suk Jin.</i>

176
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,658
<i>The reason being,
he'd be easy to order around.</i>

177
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:50,291
<i>He's the type of person who would be easy
to order around and discard when I'm done.</i>

178
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,696
<i>Ha Ha is...</i>

179
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,688
What is this that you wrote
down here?

180
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,705
[Directs the question to the person
who filled out the survey.]

181
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:01,173
<i>I like Ha Ha, but there's something that
I also fear about him.</i>

182
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:05,166
<i>My first impression of my partner.
'What is the deal with this kid?'</i>

183
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:09,982
<i>My partner's best attribute?
A strong sense of self-preservation.</i>

184
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,951
<i>My partner's downfall is that
he's very long.</i>

185
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,131
[Long would mean, Giraffe.]

186
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,262
Sense of preservation,
and what is with this kid?

187
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,858
This must be Joo Hwan's survey.

188
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,819
Next.

189
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,490
<i>My first impression of my partner.</i>

190
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,532
<i>I got cussed out and insulted
from the very first moment of meeting him.</i>

191
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,805
<i>I thought he would be a nice person,
but he's a very prickly person.</i>

192
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,894
Who could it be?

193
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:35,185
<i>What I don't like about my partner is that
he likes to torment his partner.</i>

194
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:39,527
<i>Most difficult part of the day was...
The whole day was very difficult.</i>

195
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,346
If I could swap my partner out for anyone else
then I would pick Kim Kwang Soo.

196
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:47,048
<i>[Kim Kwang Soo]</i>

197
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,107
Don't you think that's going too far?

198
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:53,364
[Kim Kwang Soo... not 'Lee Kwang Soo'.]

199
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,816
[Even with that huge name tag
on his back?]

200
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:01,061
<i>My first impression of my partner is her
always sunny disposition, positive attitude</i>

201
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,031
<i>and she's a cute little brat
with a lot of love and affection.</i>

202
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:05,675
<i>Another positive thing about her is</i>

203
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:09,544
<i>that even in moments of anguish,
she still sounds cheery and happy.</i>

204
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:15,390
[Big-nose's cheesy survey answers.]

205
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,082
- 'Most difficult moment with my partner?'
- 'None, I was happy all day.'

206
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:23,975
<i>If I could swap out my partner,
then I would choose Lee Sang Hwa.</i>

207
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,930
<i>Reason being, I would like to have her
become like my little sister.</i>

208
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,744
You wouldn't even have been able to rent
that car if it hadn't been for me.

209
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,886
Okay, I'm sorry.

210
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,574
<i>First impression of my partner?</i>

211
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,484
<i>I'll have to forget any dreams of
coming in at first place.</i>

212
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,156
<i>But I think it's going to be
a fun day.</i>

213
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,160
<i>If I could swap out my partner,
then I would choose Jong Kook.</i>

214
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,404
<i>I need to get on Jong Kook's
good side.</i>

215
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:46,596
- Who could this be?
- You didn't write my name down either.

216
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,838
[Bingo!
It's Jung Nan's survey.]

217
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:53,608
<i>My first impression of my partner
was that I felt a little uncomfortable.</i>

218
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:57,362
<i>Best thing about my partner is that
he's strong and quick on his feet.</i>

219
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,624
<i>My partner's downfall
is that he talks too much.</i>

220
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,444
<i>I wish that
he'd suddenly fall ill or something.</i>

221
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,077
- It's the best when he's sick!
- Min Jong!

222
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,399
I was just trying to be funny.

223
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,706
<i>If I could swap my partner out
for anyone else...</i>

224
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,483
<i>I would still choose Jong Kook.</i>

225
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,458
<i>I can't betray him.</i>

226
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,443
You're so warm hearted.

227
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:24,315
Even though I just met him
for the first time today

228
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:28,692
I really feel like I've known him all my life.
I'm not even kidding how close I feel to him.

229
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:31,830
Going through a tough day like this together
really makes me feel close to my partner.

230
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:33,844
[Going through tough times together
makes them feel closer to their partners.]

231
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,942
- I knew we'd be great together.
- We need to work better together.

232
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,241
[No matter what anyone else says,
my partner is the best!]

233
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,232
- You know, don't you, Seung Soo?
- Yeah, I know.

234
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,797
[These tightly knit partnerships...]

235
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:50,993
[come to betrayal and blame.]

236
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:59,645
[The biggest moment of uncertainty
in all of Running Man history!]

237
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:04,996
[Stay tuned for these unbelievable
turn of events.]

238
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:12,095
[The next day- 5 AM.]

239
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:19,045
[The breakfast table is already set.]

240
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:27,091
[A breakfast feast with
the best of Haenam's specialties.]

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,364
[But it's still the middle of the night
inside these tents.]

242
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:40,121
<i>Time for everyone to get up.</i>

243
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:43,319
<i>You have to come out of the tent holding
your partner's hand</i>

244
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,389
<i>to be able to get your breakfast.</i>

245
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:49,116
<i>You have to come out of the tent holding
your partner's hand</i>

246
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,156
<i>for you to be able to get your breakfast.</i>

247
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,055
<i>The sooner you get out here,
more food you'll be able to eat.</i>

248
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,841
<i>It's time to get up.</i>

249
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:04,070
<i>You have to come out of the tent holding
your partner's hand</i>

250
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,790
<i>for you to be able to get your breakfast.
Time to get up.</i>

251
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:15,177
<i>There's not a huge portion of food,
so the sooner you come, more you can eat.</i>

252
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,460
<i>The sooner you can get out here,
more food you'll be able to eat.</i>

253
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:23,958
[In just a matter of one single day,
they're already working perfectly in sync.]

254
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:28,143
<i>You have to come out of the tent holding
your partner's hand</i>

255
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,320
<i>for you to be able to get
your breakfast.</i>

256
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,517
[Even the middle aged bachelor wakes up.]

257
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,320
<i>Time to get up.</i>

258
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,617
<i>You have to come out of the tent holding
your partner's hand</i>

259
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,706
<i>for you to be able to get
your breakfast.</i>

260
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:50,033
[Thanks to the early rising baby faced man,
Min Jong and Jong Kook make it down first.]

261
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,084
- You can help yourself.
- We can just help ourselves?

262
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,305
[Ha Ha and Man Suk come down
in second place.]

263
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,581
[The sooner they make it down,
the sooner you can get your breakfast.]

264
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:09,253
[The natural faced beauties.]

265
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,172
It's not easy climbing out of that tent.

266
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,669
Come on, Seung Soo.

267
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,172
[The already long food line.]

268
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:45,242
Sorry for the lack of variety with the food.
I know you normally get better than that.

269
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:48,448
- There's no need to say all that.
- Is that abalone?

270
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,613
We have to take all the food so that we
can be entertained by Kwang Soo's reaction.

271
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:58,876
[Taking all the food is for Kwang Soo's sake.]

272
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:01,774
- Are you really going to be like this?
- Joo Hwan has to take all the remaining food.

273
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:05,404
So that Kwang Soo has nothing
but plain rice to eat.

274
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:08,951
But why are you being so nice to us
first thing in the morning?

275
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:11,225
I just asked why you're being so nice to us
first thing in the morning.

276
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:14,435
Are you trying to get us fed early so that
you can make us run that much earlier?

277
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,749
[Why don't you just enjoy
your breakfast for now?]

278
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:22,160
<i>While you're finishing up
your breakfast...</i>

279
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,268
<i>we will call you up one by one individually
to give you your orders.</i>

280
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:30,022
<i>We'll call you up one by one
while you finish up your breakfast.</i>

281
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:33,433
[Give us our orders individually?]

282
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,112
[Just what is going to be happening today?]

283
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,842
[Jae Suk walks into the ladies' tent
to receive his secret orders.]

284
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,889
This tent is so nice.
There are even beds in here.

285
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,302
I don't even know
if I got any sleep last night.

286
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,469
- You know the Mafia game, right?
- Yes, I know.

287
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,542
- We're going to play the Mafia game today.
- Really?

288
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:02,624
[Mafia Game?]

289
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,448
You can't let anyone else
find out your real identity.

290
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,802
I will now tell you
what your identity is going to be.

291
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,003
Today, you are going to be...

292
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,508
[Today, you are going to be...
either a civilian or mafia.]

293
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:17,860
We will tell you the rules more in detail
once we gather everyone up.

294
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,444
If the civilian captures the mafia,
then the civilian wins.

295
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:25,422
But if the mafia avoids getting caught,
then the mafia wins.

296
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:27,853
Today, you are going to be...

297
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,254
Ah... is that right?

298
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,586
Today, you are going to be...

299
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,470
Today, you are going to be...

300
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,734
Ah, it's the mafia game.

301
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:52,279
Today, you are going to be...

302
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,084
[Today, you are...
either a civilian, or the mafia.]

303
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,344
Today, you are going to be...

304
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:11,638
[Just which one of these members...
is the mafia member?]

305
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:18,204
[Today, you are going to be...]

306
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:23,934
[...]

307
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,297
That's it.

308
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:34,436
No hint of getting flustered,
but just calmly... 'That's it.'

309
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:42,636
[Orders are now complete.]

310
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:45,379
- So everyone received their orders?
- Yes.

311
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:50,949
Today's race is, the popular mafia game,
Mafia vs Civilians.

312
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,999
There are currently members of the mafia
hidden amongst the group.

313
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,085
The objective of the game
is to capture the mafia member.

314
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:58,769
At the end of each mission

315
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,225
you will choose two people whom you suspect
as being a mafia member and disqualify them.

316
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,357
If at the end of the final mission,
the mafia member is already disqualified

317
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,998
then it will be the civilians' victory.

318
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,578
But if at least one member of the mafia still
remains, then it'll be the mafia's victory.

319
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:16,722
But if you rank high on your missions

320
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:21,125
you will be abstained from being
eliminated during the mafia elimination round.

321
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,485
- Up to how many people?
- That's different for each mission.

322
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,097
Mafia members will have to work
very hard.

323
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:30,402
Once you're eliminated whether
you're mafia or civilian

324
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,419
you can no longer participate
in any further missions.

325
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,827
Two people will be eliminated
per mission.

326
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:40,684
The ones who are eliminated will have to
prepare lunch for the remaining survivors.

327
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:47,234
So they will have to have a delicious meal
prepared for the remaining survivors.

328
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:50,167
- That's a task for eliminated people.
- I really hate cooking.

329
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,883
You can all go on to the next location
with your partners.

330
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,373
You may get started now.

331
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:57,698
[Mafia game- Start.]

332
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,903
You won't have too much time to determine
who you suspect as being mafia.

333
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,685
I already know who it is.

334
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,848
[Already full of suspicions.]

335
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:21,062
Ji Suk Jin and Ryu Seung Soo
are the mafia members.

336
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,413
I don't care what he is,
but I'm going to eliminate Jong Kook

337
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:26,031
and make him cook my lunch
for me.

338
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,841
[Is that because he misses
Chef Kkuk's cooking skills?]

339
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:30,394
I second that!

340
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:34,700
- Lee Kwang Soo has a question.
- Do mafia members know who each other are?

341
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,049
- You should know that, shouldn't you?
- I'm sure you know the question to that.

342
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,501
[Even the slightest bit of weirdness
will immediately get you suspected.]

343
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:43,593
It really isn't me.

344
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,561
I recommend Lee Seung Soo.

345
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,319
Ryu Seung Soo.

346
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,754
The writers aren't going to be
that obvious.

347
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:55,938
[Why would that be an obvious choice?]

348
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,204
- Why would that be an obvious choice?
- Think about it.

349
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm sure that they know that
everyone will be suspecting me.

350
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,432
- They'll know you'll all be suspecting me.
- No.

351
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,143
Why are you stuttering so much like that?

352
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:12,170
- The writers aren't that stupid.
- Ryu Seung Soo!

353
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:16,288
Ryu Seung Soo!

354
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,771
If I had my choice,
I would say that it's Sang Hwa.

355
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,465
Yes, I like that choice.
That's a nice first guess.

356
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,442
- I think that Sang Hwa is a mafia member.
- I think we're half mafia, and half civilians.

357
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,793
I'm sure that Sang Hwa's going to be
working very hard today.

358
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,048
I always work hard at everything
that I do.

359
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:38,256
Mafia!

360
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:42,316
I think that it could be Man Suk too.

361
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:45,462
I think that you're going to
be it in the end.

362
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:48,253
[Trust no one.]

363
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,228
I think it could be Ha Dong Hoon.
I think it's Ha Dong Hoon.

364
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:55,640
- Don't you think so?
- Dong Hoon gets mad when he's cornered.

365
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:58,348
It's not me!

366
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,246
[Just which of these members
are members of the mafia?]

367
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:09,892
[Mafia vs Civilians-
First location- Mud flats of Haenam.]

368
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,439
Don't we have to finish this game
before the tide comes in?

369
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,045
He keeps talking about what we're going to do
if the tide comes in during the mission.

370
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:22,018
Everyone's pretty sure that
Seung Soo is a mafia member.

371
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,733
[Everyone's already sure that Seung Soo
is a member of the mafia?]

372
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:27,166
There's almost an invisible sign on your back
saying that you're a mafia member.

373
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,790
This is your first mission.

374
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:35,438
This will be a very important mission whether
you're a mafia member or a civilian.

375
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,476
We've already identified
one of the mafia members.

376
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,326
- Who?
- Ryu Seung Soo.

377
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,050
[This guy.]

378
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:45,249
Both the producer and Seung Soo both have an
identical expression on their faces right now.

379
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,297
- You're going to end up regretting this.
- No way.

380
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:50,885
- You're going to end up regretting this.
- No, not at all.

381
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,031
I will now explain your first
mission to you.

382
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,115
Just as it sounds...
it's a crab fight mission.

383
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,651
- What?
- A crab fight mission?

384
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,867
Don't you think that you're being
too harsh with your words?

385
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,948
Then can I just fight as I am?
('Gae'= Crabs or Gary's nickname.]

386
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:09,784
As I'm sure you saw on your way here,
we've prepared a lane platform.

387
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,592
I saw that.

388
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:14,578
There are a lot of crabs out in
the mud flats.

389
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:20,671
Each team has to go catch five crabs that are
the size of your two fingers or larger.

390
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:28,508
And you have to choose one crab out of
your five that you think will be the fastest

391
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,741
and you will place that crab
in one of those lanes.

392
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,394
- First and second place winners...
- Will be abstained?

393
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,720
- They will be abstained.
- You're so lucky!

394
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:39,218
[First and second place winners of this game
will be abstained from elimination.]

395
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,940
- You're so lucky!
- We're going to win this one.

396
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:45,643
[Mafia member or Civilian,
first and second place will be abstained.]

397
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:47,798
As soon as your five crabs
are approved

398
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,771
then you can place the crab in the lane
without having to wait for the other teams.

399
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:52,531
- Really?
- Seriously?

400
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,436
[Sooner they come back with the crabs,
the sooner they can get started in the race.]

401
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:58,481
- We have to go find five crabs.
- But the crab might have a mind of its own.

402
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:01,557
[First step in the process-
Change into appropriate gear.]

403
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,745
Everyone else's are new except for mine.

404
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,782
Yeah, something is a bit off.

405
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:11,686
[No matter what the situation,
everything is a cause for suspicion?]

406
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:17,210
[Everyone sets out to catch their crabs!]

407
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,058
Let's go.

408
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:27,828
[Check under all the rocks.]

409
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:35,260
- Jong Kook, I don't see any crabs.
- Do you see any crabs?

410
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,157
I don't even see anything moving.

411
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:40,403
What if all the crabs are hiding from us?

412
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:45,161
- They're all hiding in these holes.
- I think they're hiding in the holes.

413
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:52,154
[Kim-Enthusiastic is stuck in the mud.]

414
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:55,961
Hey, Kim-Enthusiastic.
Stop getting stuck and catch those crabs.

415
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,601
What is this!

416
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,664
- What is this thing!
- Did you catch something?

417
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:05,362
[Finds something long and lean
just like his own physique.]

418
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,752
- What is that?
- I caught a sea worm!

419
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:12,266
- That's not a sea worm.
- What is that?

420
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:16,959
[But aren't you going to catch any crabs?]

421
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,993
- That's not a worm, it's a clam of sorts.
- Crabs don't usually come out at this time.

422
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,459
They only come out once the sun is up.

423
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:33,884
[Discovers his first crab
even before the sun is up in the sky.]

424
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,937
[A big one!]

425
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,595
[Crab Doctor, Seung Soo,
finds one after another!]

426
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:48,149
- Jae Suk!
- Yeah?

427
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,225
- How many have you caught so far?
- I haven't even seen a single crab yet.

428
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,254
I haven't even seen a single crab yet.
Let me see what you have.

429
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,787
- I'm impressed with you.
- See how hard I'm working?

430
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,982
[Hard working Seung Soo.]

431
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:05,105
- We can't let Seung Soo find them all.
- Sang Hwa!

432
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:06,575
- Yes?
- Come here!

433
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,757
[Mud flats skating skills.]

434
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:11,615
Here's one.

435
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,563
This is where we should search.

436
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:18,444
[Discovers a field of crabs!]

437
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:24,703
- I got one!
- That's huge!

438
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:30,329
[Finds a plethora of crabs
out in Haenam's mudflats.]

439
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,755
[Even though catching the crabs
is important...]

440
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:40,468
[It's more important to catch ones
that are quick and speedy!]

441
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,507
Hey, I've already caught three.

442
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:52,023
It's huge!
This one is totally huge.

443
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:55,709
- I've already caught four.
- I have one big one, and two little ones.

444
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,637
Then we're all set.
We've got our five.

445
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,675
[King sized crab is discovered!]

446
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,608
This one is awesome!

447
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,724
What did you catch?

448
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:15,672
[Sheer size of the crab makes others
scream out loud in admiration.]

449
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,283
[Ta da!
Haenam's king crab.]

450
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:25,248
[Finder, Ji Hyo,
is more shocked at the sight.]

451
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,335
It can snip you.

452
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:31,725
This one is big.
We're all set.

453
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:35,123
[Suk Jin and Jung Nan also succeed
at catching their five crabs.]

454
00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:36,673
I'm telling you that this is plenty!

455
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:40,365
[Mafia vs Civilians- Crab race.]

456
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:47,575
[Jong Kook and Min Jong-
First to return with their five crabs.]

457
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,567
We can even make crab stew
with these guys.

458
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:51,507
Your five crabs are accepted.

459
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:55,882
[First and second place winners will be
abstained from first round of elimination.]

460
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:02,335
[Jong Kook and Min Jong are first to
enter their crab in the race.]

461
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,786
[But it keeps trying to go
in the opposite direction.]

462
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:11,523
- Can you get out of the way?
- Get away from me!

463
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,518
[The king crab gets thrown down
in the lane.]

464
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,445
Did you see that?

465
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:23,681
[Bigger the size,
the faster they should run...]

466
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:25,097
- We're here!
- Come on, guys.

467
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:30,454
[Jong Kook and Min Jong's crab
is currently in the lead.]

468

[Jae Suk and Seung Soo's crab
is taking a nap.]

469
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:39,698
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan are third
to enter the crab race.]

470
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:42,013
[Pinched by the crab.]

471
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,433
[Jong Kook and Min Jong's crab is
by far in the lead.]

472
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:56,451
[Kwang Soo, Joo Hwan, Jae Suk, Seung Soo's
crabs are loving their starting line spot.]

473
00:29:58,226 --> 00:29:59,628
You may get started.

474
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:01,507
[More teams join the race.]

475
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,202
[Jong Kook and Min Jong's crab is already
past the halfway mark.]

476
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,647
[Total and utter concentration.]

477
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,966
It pinched me!

478
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:19,003
[At this rate, Jong Kook and Min Jong will
abstain from the first round of elimination?]

479
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:20,836
It's not even moving.

480
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,696
[And this loyal crabby friend.]

481
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,757
[Not a single crab is following in Jong Kook
and Min Jong's crab's footsteps.]

482
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:38,796
[All the other crabs are still remaining
motionless at the starting line.]

483
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,968
[This crab may be moving slow,
but the movement remains constant.]

484
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,278
- That's moving really well.
- That crab is really moving!

485
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:57,152
[Jong Kook and Min Jong's crab is
almost at the finish line!]

486
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,806
[Falls into the mud flats.]

487
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:09,081
[Jong Kook and Min Jong's crab
finishes in first place.]

488
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,590
[And a fierce battle for second place.]

489
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:16,610
[They're all neck and neck.]

490
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:22,476
[Anxious crab directors...]

491
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:27,011
[And relaxed crab runners.]

492
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,716
It's moving!

493
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:37,684
[Kwang Soo and
Joo Hwan's crab is on the move!]

494
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,696
[Picking up some speed!]

495
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:45,202
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan's crab is all
of a sudden in the running for second place!]

496
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:47,896
This is your heaven!

497
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,504
The ocean where your home is,
is at the other end of this lane!

498
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:55,116
[The crab comes to a rest once again.]

499
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:03,159
I need a crash cart!

500
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,443
[Stay strong, little crabby friend.]

501
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:13,020
- Let's get you back to the ocean.
- Please!

502
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:18,255
[When one friend comes to a stop...
then everyone else also comes to a stop.]

503
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,503
[It's not like I can even run for them...]

504
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,270
It's moving again!

505
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:33,019
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan's crab resumes
its move after a brief rest.]

506
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,678
You can do this!

507
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,030
Just a little bit more.

508
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:42,490
[Just then... Gary and
Sang Hwa's crab starts to move.]

509
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:46,820
[Similar to Sang Hwa's speed
skating style.]

510
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,833
- You can't touch the crab, Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

511
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,772
Ugh, they're so loud.

512
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,836
Everyone seems so anxious.

513
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,241
All the mafia members must be
really anxious.

514
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:11,535
[Mafia vs Civilians-
Second place winners will be abstained.]

515
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,752
[Gary and Sang Hwa's crab
picks up its speed again.]

516
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:28,703
Please move.

517
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:31,389
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo's new crab runner
just remains at the starting line as well.]

518
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:37,930
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan's crab
takes the lead once more!]

519
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:43,491
[Human and the crab are as one.]

520
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:47,942
[Sang Hwa's expression looks as though
she's the one in the running lane.]

521
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,036
[Gary and Sang Hwa's
crab's last spurt of speed.]

522
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:03,861
[Gary and Sang Hwa's crab
takes the lead again.]

523
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:08,010
[Almost to the finish line!]

524
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:12,679
[Gary and Sang Hwa's crab is looking
promising for second place.]

525
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:17,758
[Back to its home.]

526
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,143
[Gary and Sang Hwa come in at second place
for the crab race.]

527
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,409
Gary and Sang Hwa in second place.

528
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,477
- We're doing five rounds, right?
- No, the race is over.

529
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:29,636
They're fighting amongst themselves
right now.

530
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:35,107
Our crab is just sitting there
and blowing bubbles.

531
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,203
Please return all your hard working crabs
back to their homes.

532
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,641
[Time to say goodbye
to their crabby friends.]

533
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,750
Go back to your nice homes.

534
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,806
Even though you didn't win first place,
you were still the best.

535
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,404
Time for you guys to get back
to the mud.

536
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:55,748
[Thanks for all your hard work!]

537
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,167
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

538
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:59,422
So this is what it feels like
to win first place.

539
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:04,715
I had a good feeling when we
started out this race.

540
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,733
Min Jong picked a really good runner.

541
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,231
We had a lot of potential runners,
but Min Jong picked a really good one.

542
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:14,303
- That was really close.
- I'm pretty disappointed.

543
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,068
But we had the biggest crab.

544
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:23,131
First and second place winners of this race
are Jong Kook, Min Jong, Gary and Sang Hwa.

545
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:25,705
[First and second place winners of this race
are Jong Kook, Min Jong, Gary and Sang Hwa.]

546
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,681
So no matter how suspicious the rest of
you are of these couples

547
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:33,249
they cannot be eliminated in the first
round of mafia suspect elimination.

548
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,872
- You guys are so lucky.
- There are others that I'm suspicious of.

549
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:38,464
- Can I say something?
- Yes, go ahead.

550
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:42,267
I didn't know it would feel this good
to come in at first place in a race.

551
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:44,440
- Say something, Seung Soo.
- Excuse me?

552
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,485
[Flustered?]

553
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:50,195
Seung Soo's so afraid of getting
eliminated right now

554
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:51,975
and that's why he's not even
able to say anything.

555
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,133
It's one uphill battle after another.

556
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:55,966
He didn't even stay anywhere near me
when we were catching the crabs

557
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,490
because he didn't want to
garner any suspicion.

558
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:58,966
Please listen carefully.

559
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:02,214
You will have exactly ten minutes
from this moment to freely question

560
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:04,698
whether or not someone is a mafia member,
or what they're reasoning may be

561
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,988
or any other questions you may have for
each other to see who the mafia member is.

562
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:11,546
Spend the next ten minutes to discuss and
find out who you think are mafia members.

563
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:15,894
Since this is all a couple mission,
you will choose one couple as your suspects.

564
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:19,002
[The couple that's suspected of being
the mafia members will be eliminated.]

565
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,440
Ryu Seung Soo isn't a mafia member.

566
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:27,710
[Protection mode of his partner as soon as
he hears that it's a couple elimination.]

567
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:30,794
- He really isn't a mafia member.
- I definitely am not one of them.

568
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:33,558
- You're a mafia member, aren't you?
- No, I really am not.

569
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,698
Jae Suk looks so pitiful right now.
I feel bad for him.

570
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,979
<i>One person that I'm sure of is,
Seung Soo.</i>

571
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:54,038
- But... that's not it.
- Give Seung Soo a chance to talk.

572
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,908
If you think about it once more,
you'll realize that I'm not a mafia member.

573
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:01,784
- Why?
- Everyone thinks that I look like one, right?

574
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,376
No, it's not because of your looks.
It's because of your behavior.

575
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,738
I'm positive that Seung Soo is it

576
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,226
but I want to keep want to keep seeing him
acting all anxious and nervous like that.

577
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:14,995
You're so cruel.

578
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:18,007
[They're all so sure of Seung Soo
being a mafia member?]

579
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:20,529
What good is there of suspecting
me of being a mafia member?

580
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,862
Just let him survive long enough
to go fishing in the next round.

581
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:27,394
- We'll just let you come with us.
- Let him go fishing at least.

582
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,277
I really want to go fishing.

583
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,433
- Let him go fishing.
- What are you guys going to do in the end?

584
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:37,482
- What if I end up being a civilian?
- Then we'll just tell you that we're sorry.

585
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,199
We'll give you our formal apology
if that ends up being the case.

586
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,770
Betrayals come as naturally as breathing
to these people.

587
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:47,308
These aren't the type of people to feel
guilty over something like that.

588
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,679
[Is Seung Soo a mafia, or is he a civilian?]

589
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,277
Why don't you guys suspect
some other people too?

590
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:55,589
- What about Man Suk?
- Sang Hwa can't be included in this.

591
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,870
- Man Suk.
- Man Suk, you're mafia, aren't you?

592
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:01,557
- I really want to be one.
- His voice suddenly sounds different.

593
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:05,036
[His voice is all of a sudden very different
from how he normally sounds?]

594
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,413
If I were to do my mafia voice,
then it would sound very obvious.

595
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,247
- It's obvious, you say?
- It's obvious to me right now.

596
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:18,315
[Jae Suk tries to divert their suspicion
onto the other couple.]

597
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:22,319
Our team may be obvious,
but your team is way more obvious.

598
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,829
[Diverting the suspicion back on Seung Soo.]

599
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,021
Ryun Seung Soo isn't it!

600
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:29,599
- The writers...
- Hold your tongue.

601
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:34,469
[Anything that he says gets him suspected
of being mafia even more...]

602
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:37,700
- What about Dong Joon?
- Yes?

603
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:42,602
[Directing his arrow at the silent
Dong Joon.]

604
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,686
- Lee Kwang Soo, I'm suspicious of you.
- I didn't even say anything until just now.

605
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,355
[Everyone is suspicious of one another.]

606
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:52,790
We have to suspect Jung Nan too.

607
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,539
- We're all suspects.
- You're right.

608
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,419
- Yes, we're all suspects.
- I think Min Jong is one.

609
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,687
I'm positive that Min Jong is one,
but we can't do anything about it right now.

610
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:04,826
Do you remember the survey we
took last night?

611
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:08,632
[Perhaps the surveys from last night could
be a clue as to who the mafia members are?]

612
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:12,247
We have to be suspicious of the people
whom we crossed paths with.

613
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,009
You're suspicious too.

614
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:18,417
[Even if they're suspicious of Jong Kook,
he's abstained from this elimination.]

615
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:22,549
Seeing how chatty Jae Suk is becoming,
I'm positive that Seung Soo is mafia.

616
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,963
[Their never-ending suspicion
of Seung Soo.]

617
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,163
Just let him go fishing at least.

618
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,672
What happens to the people who didn't receive
any votes for being a wanted partner?

619
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,581
Joo Hwan!

620
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:35,342
- Why weren't you one of them, Joo Hwan?
- Four people got more than two votes.

621
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:36,937
Why are you talking so fast?

622
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:40,760
This is how I normally talk.

623
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,016
Joo Hwan.

624
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:45,744
- Are you good at cooking?
- No, I'm not good at it at all.

625
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:48,361
Take this opportunity and learn
how to cook.

626
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:51,364
[Are you going to eliminate him
just so that he can make you your lunch?]

627
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:54,807
If I was the writer, I would definitely have
chosen either Sang Hwa or Joo Hwan.

628
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:57,591
[Man Suk suspects that either Sang Hwa
or Joo Hwan is a mafia member?]

629
00:39:57,592 --> 00:39:59,732
You're not making much sense
right now.

630
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,473
If I could say anything about it,
Man Suk is too ugly to have been chosen.

631
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:06,473
[He's not mafia because he's too ugly?]

632
00:40:07,515 --> 00:40:10,110
I abandoned my greed to be the star
of any show a long time ago.

633
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,682
I think that even the hat Man Suk is wearing
makes him look like mafia.

634
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:17,334
[Man Suk's hat looks mafia-ish?]

635
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:18,925
Get me a different hat.

636
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:23,501
- I'm sure of it now!
- He's definitely mafia!

637
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:27,818
[Every action that they take brings
on more suspicions upon themselves.]

638
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,237
There are one or two people
that I'm pretty suspicious of.

639
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:32,955
Who do you think they are, Min Jong?

640
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:36,017
[Min Jong's list of
possible mafia suspects are?]

641
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,635
Tell us who you think they are, Min Jong.

642
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:40,353
- There are two that I'm suspicious of.
- Who are they?

643
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,662
Just spit it out, Min Jong.
Tell the viewers who you think they are.

644
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:48,959
Joo Hwan is one of them,
and the other is, Ha Ha.

645
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:59,580
- We had forgotten about Ha Ha.
- Ha Ha's perfect for this type of role.

646
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:00,695
[The traitorous Ha Ha?]

647
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:04,521
I think Suk Jin could be one too.
See how his nostrils are flaring right now?

648
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:07,606
- No, he's not it.
- No, he definitely isn't one of them.

649
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,598
We're all sure that you're one of them but we
can't touch you because you won first place.

650
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,228
None of this matters to me right now.

651
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:16,939
[Did Min Jong do his best to win the crab race
because he knows that he's mafia?]

652
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,869
I don't care what any of you think.

653
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:24,835
But I can see all the real guilty ones
from my angle here.

654
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:28,996
I haven't said this in a real long time, but
don't act like you're quick to notice things.

655
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:32,793
- Seriously.
- I'm sure that Min Jong is mafia.

656
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:38,071
[But no matter how suspicious,
he's untouchable during this first round.]

657
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:41,817
- Don't you think that Seung Soo is it?
- What about Dong Joon?

658
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,982
- Dong Joon looks way too happy right now.
- And he's being way too quite.

659
00:41:44,983 --> 00:41:47,335
- Dong Joon looks way too happy.
- Your ten minutes are up.

660
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:49,745
- Wait, give us 30 more seconds.
- No, I can't.

661
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:54,067
You'll have ten minutes after each mission.
You can continue this later on.

662
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:56,096
I don't think I'll be around
for the next round.

663
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,627
I'm speaking from my 20 years of experience,
but it's always the quiet ones.

664
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:07,181
[They're certain that the quiet one
is a mafia member?]

665
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:09,036
We need to think about Dong Joon.

666
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:12,856
- There's Dong Joon to consider too.
- It's always the quiet ones.

667
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:16,411
[Mafia vs Civilian.]

668
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:22,060
[Will they choose the real mafia to avoid
sacrificing an innocent civilian's life?]

669
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:23,511
I don't think it's Jung Nan.

670
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:25,551
Song Ji Hyo, and Dong Joon.

671
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:29,791
Raise your hands if any of you thinks
that these two are the real mafia members.

672
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:35,672
[Ji Hyo and Dong Joon receive six votes.]

673
00:42:36,585 --> 00:42:42,712
Raise your hands if any of you thinks
that Joo Hwan or Kwang Soo are mafia.

674
00:42:42,712 --> 00:42:44,105
One, two, three.

675
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:47,169
All of you are very intelligent civilians!

676
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:50,599
It's not because of you guys,
but it's because another team is the focus.

677
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:55,776
Raise your hands if any of you thinks
that Kim Jung Nan or Ji Suk Jin are mafia.

678
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:58,704
[Suk Jin and Jung Nan- 0 points.]

679
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:02,020
Raise your hands if any of you think that
Yoo Jae Suk or Ryu Seung Soo are mafia.

680
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,825
[Are you kidding me?]

681
00:43:06,403 --> 00:43:10,999
Raise your hands if any of you thinks
that Ha Ha or Man Suk are mafia.

682
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,056
It really isn't me.
It's not me.

683
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,124
[Ha Ha and Man Suk- Seven votes.]

684
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:18,528
- The voting is over, right?
- Yes.

685
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:23,211
You two are mafia members!

686
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:28,020
[Ha Ha and Man Suk are convicted of
being mafia suspects.]

687
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:32,910
[Time to pull off their name tags to see
if they're really mafia or civilians.]

688
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:37,064
You did the right thing to choose Man Suk,
but you really made a big mistake with me.

689
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:45,261
[If a civilian's life was just sacrificed...
then it's more strength for the mafia.]

690
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:48,917
[Are Ha Ha and Man Suk civilians
or mafia?]

691
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:54,417
[They'll get their answer once
the name tag is ripped off of their backs.]

692
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:00,323
[Has a mafia member been placed
under arrest?]

693
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:03,104
[Or did an innocent civilian's life
just get sacrificed?]

694
00:44:06,138 --> 00:44:09,784
[Ha Ha was a civilian!]

695
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:13,686
[Fails to apprehend their mafia member.]

696
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:16,621
You sure are quick
to notice things, aren't you?

697
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:19,400
Sir, I mean, Inspector.

698
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,520
I just got eliminated from the whole race
and it's only 8:07 AM right now.

699
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:26,480
[Civilian Ha Ha's morning elimination.]

700
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,830
[Time to check whether Man Suk is
mafia or civilian.]

701
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,427
- No, he's not the mafia.
- All you people and your suspicions.

702
00:44:34,428 --> 00:44:36,665
- I think he's a civilian.
- No, he can't be.

703
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:40,605
- I really am sure that Seung Soo is it.
- I'm telling you that it's not me.

704
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:42,485
[The never-ending suspicion
of Seung Soo.]

705
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,417
This will be your last
fishing trip of your life.

706
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:47,883
Think about what you just did to Ha Ha.
You guys were so adamant about him.

707
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,535
Why are you stuttering so much?

708
00:44:51,658 --> 00:44:54,687
[His truly intriguing identity...]

709
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:57,009
- He just wants to go fishing.
- What if Man Suk is a civilian?

710
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:04,826
[Will Man Suk be a civilian or mafia?]

711
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:16,271
[Man Suk is mafia!]

712
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:23,269
[First mafia member is apprehended.]

713
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,720
<i>Today, you are... mafia.</i>

714
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:29,482
[Today, you are mafia.]

715
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,735
- I had a feeling about him.
- Coarse, crass, and deceitful!

716
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:47,232
[Mafia member, Man Suk,
had everyone completely fooled!]

717
00:45:48,306 --> 00:45:51,057
Ryu Seung Soo will be next!

718
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:57,173
Ryu Seung Soo!

719
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,553
We now have two eliminated players
and it's only 8:30 in the morning.

720
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:02,634
To the rest of my surviving mafia members,
kill lots of innocent civilians for me.

721
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:05,330
I swear I just heard Seung Soo say, 'okay'
to that request.

722
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:09,196
[That will only get you in more trouble...]

723
00:46:12,932 --> 00:46:15,137
- Why didn't you answer him?
- Why didn't you?

724
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:17,050
I'm telling you that it's not me.

725
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:19,154
It really isn't me!

726
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,861
Man Suk.

727
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,166
Even though it's disappointing
that we've been eliminated already...

728
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:35,713
you really are something else.

729
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,162
How could you have done that to me?

730
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:42,737
[Feeling betrayed as his partner.]

731
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:48,724
I was really hoping... that
you wouldn't speak up or anything.

732
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,768
Everything came down to a ruin because
you decided to speak up.

733
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,094
I can't believe that I, the Ace of the show,
got eliminated so easily like this.

734
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:03,200
They really are going to regret losing
their ace civilian player.

735
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:10,667
[Second mission location-
A mud flat harbor.]

736
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:17,332
[Will the civilians be able to place another
mafia member under arrest?]

737
00:47:18,011 --> 00:47:20,271
We wish you the best of luck in capturing
even more mafia members in this round.

738
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:23,438
You next mission is,
'My name is, King of Fishing.'

739
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:28,344
Starting with this mission,
it'll be an individual mission.

740
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:31,528
You will all board the boat with
your own fishing rod

741
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:37,179
and as soon as you catch your first fish,
then your mission is complete.

742
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,348
But the fish has to be bigger than
your hand.

743
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:41,784
- I have really big hands.
- This is so unfair!

744
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:46,346
- Your fish has to be bigger than your hands.
- Then I'd have to catch a tuna fish.

745
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:48,714
I'll try catching another rockfish.

746
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,922
You didn't even catch
a single one the last time.

747
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,068
In this round, first through fourth place
winners will be abstained from elimination.

748
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,719
You'll have to yell out a code
when you catch your fish.

749
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,267
What?

750
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:04,004
You're mafia, aren't you?

751
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:06,215
You really are acting very suspicious.

752
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,842
[Truly suspicious behavior.]

753
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,264
I'm sorry, but that just slipped out.

754
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,976
- Let's just yell out, 'Haenam'.
- Haenam.

755
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,491
- Let's get started.
- Mine has to be pretty big.

756
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:20,574
Only four of you per boat
as discussed earlier.

757
00:48:20,575 --> 00:48:23,925
[Only four per boat per instruction.]

758
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:30,816
I've never fished before in my life.

759
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:35,012
- Are you sure that you're not mafia?
- He really is suspicious.

760
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:37,699
[Seung Soo's naturally suspicious behavior
that even Sang Hwa is starting to doubt.]

761
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,276
- I'll be shocked if it's not Seung Soo.
- It really isn't me.

762
00:48:40,277 --> 00:48:42,420
- I think it could be Kwang Soo too.
- It's not Seung Soo.

763
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,650
- I think you're one of them.
- I swear that it isn't me.

764
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,691
[Even the infamously devious Giraffe
is on top of the suspect list.]

765
00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:50,984
It really isn't me.
I'll bet my whole life's savings on the line.

766
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:56,075
[Mafia and civilians' uneasy truce.]

767
00:48:56,076 --> 00:48:59,657
[With dreams of catching their big fish,
each of the boats head out to sea.]

768
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:05,803
- It's 'Dreams'.
- Oops, sorry.

769
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:10,218
[Into the mist covered Haenam ocean.]

770
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:12,705
- I'm a very experienced fisherman.
- Seriously.

771
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:15,820
- Are you kidding me?
- Watch how I catch all my fish.

772
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,794
- But you didn't catch any the last time.
- Come on.

773
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:25,109
I was about to catch a really big one,
but my line ended up snapping on me.

774
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:30,504
[Early 2014- First sea fishing expedition.]

775
00:49:32,643 --> 00:49:35,125
[These two men were all flustered over
the bent fishing rod.]

776
00:49:36,027 --> 00:49:39,164
<i>I'm sure that it's caught on
the seabed.</i>

777
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:51,461
<i>You got another one?</i>

778
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:54,103
[Soo Hong, on the other hand,
kept catching one right after another.]

779
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:56,255
<i>- Jae Suk.
- Yeah?</i>

780
00:49:56,256 --> 00:50:03,301
[Soo Hong caught all the fish...
and Jae Suk only caught humiliation.]

781
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,843
- That was just situational.
- We're all in the same boat.

782
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:08,910
Joo Hwan's the only one who knows how
to fish, and the rest of us are all the same.

783
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:11,296
- Joo Hwan knows how to fish?
- Yes, I know.

784
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,867
- How do you know how to fish?
- I used to go fishing with my dad.

785
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:16,804
He likes things like that.
Fishing, baduk...

786
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,093
[Revelation of Joo Hwan's affinity for
his less than age appropriate hobbies.]

787
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:24,668
[Just then, Seung Soo suddenly gets up
to head towards the head of the boat.]

788
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:26,396
[Huh?]

789
00:50:26,397 --> 00:50:28,407
His hobbies are the solitary type.

790
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:31,741
His hobbies are the solitary type.

791
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:33,462
What are you doing, Seung Soo?

792
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,479
I told you.
He's a bit of a goofball.

793
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:40,667
[Ryu Goofball.]

794
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:45,864
And I looked in his phone earlier,
and every picture in there is of himself.

795
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:48,818
I think I'll be able to relieve that same
moment from that scene in 'Titanic'.

796
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:50,196
- Titanic?
- Yeah.

797
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:52,206
Isn't it really nice up here?

798
00:50:52,207 --> 00:51:00,582
[The feeling of being freed with the rest
of the world rushing by beneath your feet?]

799
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,980
It's way too cold up here.

800
00:51:02,554 --> 00:51:05,606
[The cold ocean wind doesn't care
about the Goofball's romantic ideals.]

801
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,486
When else are we going to get to
experience something like this again?

802
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:09,891
- Then just come back again.
- What?

803
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:11,334
- Come back again.
- Come back where?

804
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:14,269
Come back on Running Man.

805
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,201
- How long are we going to be fishing for?
- Until you guys catch something.

806
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,299
All four of us?

807
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,638
Let's all each catch something then.
We can take all four winning spots.

808
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:22,615
Fighting!

809
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,456
[Something really is off here...]

810
00:51:29,096 --> 00:51:31,550
- I'll just go back over there.
- Yeah, go back over there.

811
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:35,460
He really is a good guy though.

812
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,341
It's just too bad that he's mafia.

813
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:46,199
[Enveloped in a veil of ocean fog...]

814
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:52,428
He really has a nice tone to his voice.

815
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,976
I bet there aren't many out of the 14 of us
who would even know that song.

816
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,102
[And the ones who know that song
are all on this boat right now.]

817
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,298
- That was a really great song.
- You know this song, right?

818
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,227
We all share a similar taste in music.

819
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,913
[This group's average age is 44...
resulting in similar taste in music.]

820
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,489
[These songs came out before Dong Joon
was even born in 1992.]

821
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,639
Remember this song?

822
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:45,038
I used to really love that song!

823
00:52:53,856 --> 00:53:00,515
[A romantic moment frozen in time
out in the midst of the foggy ocean.]

824
00:53:01,618 --> 00:53:04,855
- Look at all these fish farms.
- I wonder what they're for?

825
00:53:04,856 --> 00:53:10,153
- Maybe we can pull up a net full of abalones.
- Are those nets full of abalones?

826
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:14,661
- Can you show us?
- We have to catch our own fish.

827
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,706
I don't think Min Jong's mafia.

828
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:22,055
- He's not even thinking of winning the race.
- I don't think you're mafia anymore.

829
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:25,217
No, he's not it.
There's no way that he is.

830
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:29,847
- I just want to get off this boat.
- I would like to see that though.

831
00:53:29,848 --> 00:53:31,923
Can you show it to us just this once?

832
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:35,652
[The middle aged group wants to see
the abalone laden nets from this fish farm.]

833
00:53:35,653 --> 00:53:37,302
Do you by any chance have any
spicy pepper paste sauce onboard?

834
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,648
We don't care about catching the mafia.
Please just show us the abalone.

835
00:53:41,649 --> 00:53:43,703
[All they care about is the abalone fish farm
that they see in front of them.]

836
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:45,631
You could get eliminated from this round
if you keep wasting time like this.

837
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,198
- I don't think we're in any danger.
- I don't think anyone's suspicious of us.

838
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,021
- None of us are very suspicious.
- No one will suspect us.

839
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,547
- Please just show us the net.
- Nice!

840
00:53:52,548 --> 00:53:54,785
[The fish farm owner generously agrees
to show them the abalone.]

841
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,331
Please give us some abalone.

842
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:05,479
Just give us four that are laden
with love.

843
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:10,687
- This is so fun.
- Thank you for showing us all this.

844
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:12,597
[We'd like to thank you once more
for your generosity.]

845
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:28,997
[Haenam's freshest abalone,
pulled out right from the ocean.]

846
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:32,064
Haenam's abalone.

847
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:34,270
Wow, that's unbelievable.

848
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,510
[These giant sized abalones
aren't very easy to come by!]

849
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:44,098
[Slice them up right onboard the boat.]

850
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:49,129
[Or just bite into the whole piece.]

851
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,883
- Isn't it good, Jung Nan?
- You can't get this anywhere else.

852
00:54:58,884 --> 00:55:00,806
It's actually really sweet.

853
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:04,034
This is amazing.

854
00:55:05,014 --> 00:55:08,718
[This middle aged group is eating nature's
super food thanks to the generous farm owner.]

855
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:13,815
[Add another group of lucky boaters
to that list.]

856
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:16,539
This is so generous of him.

857
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:21,794
Is it good?

858
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:24,699
- It's unbelievable.
- Dip it in the sauce first.

859
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,833
You have to try it just as.

860
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,073
Even your reactions tend to be goofy.

861
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,646
Since we have to catch the fish anyway,
I really hope that I can catch a big one.

862
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:42,485
I really want to catch a shark.

863
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:46,132
Which one of these works better as bait?
The shrimp or the worm?

864
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:48,103
The worm works better.

865
00:55:48,104 --> 00:55:51,118
[Fishing novices trying their hands at
baiting their hooks for the first time ever.]

866
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:53,707
- How do we do it?
- Like this.

867
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,094
- What are those?
- Worms.

868
00:55:57,095 --> 00:55:59,797
[Fish's favorite bait- Worms!]

869
00:56:02,455 --> 00:56:04,331
I'll be the new Kang Tae Gong.

870
00:56:04,332 --> 00:56:06,809
[The very ambitious Blank Tae Gong.]

871
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:12,288
Come on, sharks!
Take the bait!

872
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,836
Come on, Sang Hwa.
Catch something.

873
00:56:16,162 --> 00:56:17,555
[Just then...]

874
00:56:17,556 --> 00:56:19,479
I think I'm getting a bite.

875
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,528
I got something.

876
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:27,563
I got something!

877
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:29,978
[Something's caught on the line!]

878
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:34,553
[Gary's bent fishing rod!]

879
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:38,587
It's a strong one!

880
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,692
- No!
- Why can't I reel it in?

881
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,573
- No!
- Why can't I reel it in?

882
00:56:44,574 --> 00:56:47,579
[Unbelievable strength!
Just how big can the fish be?]

883
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:52,001
[He lost the fish!]

884
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:55,530
That was way too strong.
He escaped after eating the bait.

885
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:57,957
[The mysterious giant sized something
that escaped after eating the bait.]

886
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,804
[Just what was behind all that force?]

887
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:04,939
- I think I must've pulled too hard.
- I'm not even getting any bites.

888
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,921
I can't take this.
I'm going to have to see this to the end.

889
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,710
[The giant fish put a dent in
Gae Tae Gong's pride.]

890
00:57:10,857 --> 00:57:14,528
- I'm going to be out here fishing all year.
- Just be a little bit more patient.

891
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:18,169
What if I really do catch a shark?

892
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,413
But I don't think any exist in this ocean.

893
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:22,701
Okay.

894
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,568
[These boaters start their fishing efforts
after their impromptu abalone party.]

895
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:27,465
I think I'm going to be the first one
to catch something.

896
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:29,053
I have a feeling.

897
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,080
- What did you just say?
- That I'll be the first one to catch a fish.

898
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,506
- Really?
- Yeah.

899
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:35,019
Luck is on my side.

900
00:57:36,951 --> 00:57:38,957
This will be the end for you
if you don't catch any fish right now.

901
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:43,275
You really need to catch something.
Otherwise, you're going to get eliminated.

902
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:45,628
[Seung Soo is at the top of the
mafia suspect list.]

903
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:49,884
What would you do if I catch
a really huge fish?

904
00:57:56,034 --> 00:57:59,710
I can see the tip of my fishing rod
starting to bob a little.

905
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:05,975
[The fishing rod's mysterious movements.]

906
00:58:05,976 --> 00:58:07,848
See how it's moving?

907
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:12,847
- Why is that moving?
- It's because the boat is moving.

908
00:58:17,644 --> 00:58:19,190
It wasn't because of
some fish biting the bait?

909
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,686
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk?

910
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:26,436
I'm just going to catch my one fish,
and leave the fishing world forever.

911
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:29,368
[Chances of their survival hangs on
catching this one fish.]

912
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,546
I'm really going to catch one this time.

913
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:36,691
It's a battle against time.

914
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:38,880
It's a battle against boredom.

915
00:58:38,881 --> 00:58:42,969
But this is the true essence of fishing.

916
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,313
- Have you ever even caught anything?
- Seriously?

917
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:57,725
[No way...]

918
00:58:57,726 --> 00:58:59,537
What's this?
What's going on here!

919
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,995
[The rod's bending over at
almost a 90 degree angle!]

920
00:59:04,996 --> 00:59:07,058
What if it's a tuna fish!

921
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:15,256
[Could Yoo Hyuk have caught
his much awaited first fish?]

922
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:19,262
[Huh?]

923
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:22,498
- It must've gotten caught on something again.
- That should've been a whale or something.

924
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:25,087
- Why is it always getting caught?
- Why are you trying to fool us?

925
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:27,644
Where did it caught now?

926
00:59:30,822 --> 00:59:33,076
Why is it always getting caught
on something?

927
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:38,475
I don't know if any of us will even
be able to catch anything today.

928
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:42,502
It's suspicious how serious
Jung Nan is being.

929
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:44,179
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

930
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:49,064
[Could Jung Nan, with her utterly focused
concentration be a mafia member?]

931
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:57,950
I got a bite.

932
00:59:58,988 --> 01:00:01,128
I think I got a bite.
I definitely got a bite!

933
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:04,275
[Could it be a real fish this time?]

934
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:10,470
[It's a fish!]

935
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:12,363
I got one!

936
01:00:12,364 --> 01:00:15,173
[Big-nose does it!]

937
01:00:18,726 --> 01:00:20,621
Haenam!

938
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:23,343
That's definitely bigger
than the size of my hand.

939
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:27,588
[The fish must be larger
than the size of their hands.]

940
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:31,447
Mission success.

941
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:34,623
[Big-nose succeeds the fishing mission.]

942
01:00:34,624 --> 01:00:37,144
I won first place? I caught one as soon as
I put the rod in the water.

943
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:40,358
- You even got to feast on abalone too.
- This really is a big one.

944
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:42,716
Look at how big this one is.

945
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:46,242
Look at the size of this thing.
It's huge!

946
01:00:47,746 --> 01:00:50,812
[Big-nose escapes the elimination round
for having come in at first place.]

947
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,365
- He caught something.
- I guess there are some fish in the water.

948
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:56,199
- Did you catch something?
- Yes!

949
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:01,576
- The top four winners, right?
- Only three spots left.

950
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:03,768
Then there are only four spots left.

951
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:06,901
Don't be too desperate about it.
That's not what fishing is about.

952
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:11,766
Fishing is all about patience.
You have to remain calm.

953
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:14,790
[Is he serious?]

954
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:18,251
You have to get the feel for it, Jung Nan.

955
01:01:18,252 --> 01:01:21,785
- Look at how I'm doing it.
- You caught one fish. Get over it.

956
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,274
You have to lightly bob it around
like this.

957
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:28,365
What were you saying right until
you caught that fish?

958
01:01:29,096 --> 01:01:32,261
Weren't you just saying that you've
never caught a single fish before?

959
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,725
But I just caught one.

960
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:38,909
You know those inflatable balloons that
the gas station has in front of their stores?

961
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,331
Do you prefer them to be moving,
or not moving?

962
01:01:41,914 --> 01:01:44,337
- I like them to be moving.
- So you should move your rods too.

963
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:47,009
You have to keep them moving
to grab the fish's attention.

964
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,518
- You want me to move it around that much?
- No, just slightly.

965
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,986
- Just lightly up and down.
- That's what I'm doing right now.

966
01:01:54,913 --> 01:01:57,441
Let me at least get a small one.

967
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:59,617
What are you guys doing down there?

968
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,335
You have to get a feel for the fish.

969
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:06,558
- Why don't you catch another one then?
- The last fish I caught scared the others.

970
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,477
Does it count if I just catch something
no matter what I catch?

971
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,811
- I got something.
- Really? You got something?

972
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:17,986
[Jung Nan seems to have gotten something!]

973
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,851
I really think that you did get something.
You have something!

974
01:02:20,852 --> 01:02:22,616
You really did get something.

975
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,225
[An unbelievable strength!
Enough to almost snap the rod in half!]

976
01:02:30,561 --> 01:02:36,013
[Could it be one of ocean's treasures
for this first time fisher?]

977
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,968
- I got something.
- It's huge!

978
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:50,290
[A gigantic flounder!]

979
01:02:58,127 --> 01:02:59,948
I did it, Suk Jin!

980
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:03,267
[An unbelievable flounder!]

981
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:07,013
[All natural flounder,
still alive and kicking!]

982
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:11,959
This is awesome.

983
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:16,509
- This would cost 10,000 won at the market.
- No, it would cost more than that.

984
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,913
- This is all natural too.
- It's a totally natural fish.

985
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:21,785
Here, grab it. I can't believe
she caught something this big.

986
01:03:21,786 --> 01:03:24,742
Look at this.
It's bigger than my face.

987
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:27,886
- Wow, that's amazing.
- I can't believe you caught a flounder.

988
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,409
You should take first place.
This is worth you taking first place.

989
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,452
At first, I felt something heavy
hitting against my line.

990
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:42,767
But I didn't pull it back at first because
I didn't think that it was even anything.

991
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:45,038
Then it started to bang against
my line again.

992
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,597
When I started thinking something was weird,
I found my line dipping really low.

993
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:49,836
That's when I finally realized it.

994
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:52,945
So this is how chatty one becomes
after they catch their first fish?

995
01:03:53,688 --> 01:03:57,107
[Fishing success' first side effect-
They become extremely chatty.]

996
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:59,951
- Wow, Jung Nan.
- I really am impressed.

997
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:03,781
This was my first experience of my life,
and I can't believe I caught a flounder.

998
01:04:03,782 --> 01:04:06,633
- It's beginner's luck.
- Yes, it must be.

999
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,918
Patience really paid off.
I was about to give up from being so cold.

1000
01:04:09,919 --> 01:04:12,579
You should take a picture of her
holding her fish.

1001
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,077
One, two, three.

1002
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,892
[Spring, 2014- Catching flounders in Haenam.]

1003
01:04:25,587 --> 01:04:29,011
[Jong Kook, the thing about fishing is...]

1004
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:32,574
You're standing there like some sort of
fishing master or something.

1005
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,086
No, I'm just watching to see
how you catch your fish.

1006
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:40,882
[Fishing success second side effects-
Always trying to give out their advice.]

1007
01:04:40,883 --> 01:04:43,564
- Like this?
- Yeah, they bounce around a lot.

1008
01:04:43,565 --> 01:04:45,734
I was being very gentle with
my movements.

1009
01:04:45,735 --> 01:04:48,173
I never imagined that I'd be getting
a fishing lesson from Jung Nan.

1010
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,538
Who would've ever thought that I'd be
getting a fishing lesson from her?

1011
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:53,477
[Coach Kkuk is the one getting coached.]

1012
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:57,389
You were totally right.

1013
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:00,446
- I was right, wasn't I?
- I wasn't so sure about it first.

1014
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:04,840
What he said about the dancing balloons
in front of the gas stations?

1015
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:07,491
[The inflatable balloon comparison.]

1016
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,313
You have to keep it moving
if you want to garner attention.

1017
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:14,856
[Big-nose and Jung Nan are as one now that
they've each caught their own fish.]

1018
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:18,645
- You have to keep it moving.
- You have to lure in the fish.

1019
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:20,905
So that's what I did, and I got my fish.

1020
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,437
I was just about to give up earlier
when I caught my big fish.

1021
01:05:26,438 --> 01:05:28,490
I think that's what life is
really all about.

1022
01:05:29,661 --> 01:05:31,419
You sure have become chatty.

1023
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:36,231
[Her chattiness is of Yoo Hyuk's level
after having caught her flounder.]

1024
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:40,771
I was just about to give up...
when that opportunity came knocking.

1025
01:05:40,772 --> 01:05:42,908
- That's what life is all about, isn't it?
- Yes, that's what life is all about.

1026
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:46,754
As soon as you're feeling defeated and about
to give up, that's when you get your chance.

1027
01:05:48,226 --> 01:05:51,045
You should try moving the work around
with the tip of your fishing rod.

1028
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,398
[I vow that I'll catch my fish!]

1029
01:05:58,364 --> 01:06:00,845
Who would've ever thought that Suk Jin
would try to school me on something?

1030
01:06:00,846 --> 01:06:04,588
You're moving it around too much.
Just move it around very lightly.

1031
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:09,228
Kim Jung Nan just caught something.

1032
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:12,450
- It was a really huge fish.
- Seriously?

1033
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:17,034
It's not even about catching the fish now.
I just want to give a shred of hope.

1034
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:21,342
- Who do you want to give that hope to?
-  To everyone standing around here.

1035
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:26,640
The expression on everyone's face right now...
it's so depressing right now.

1036
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,511
I want to give them hope.

1037
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:33,426
Maybe I'm not suited for fishing.
I can't ever catch anything.

1038
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:37,766
I don't know if what we're doing right now
is just some foolish waste of time.

1039
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:43,136
I don't know if I'm just wasting time.
I don't even know what we're doing.

1040
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:45,710
I just want to catch one.

1041
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,519
[Wait...]

1042
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,652
[and wait some more...]

1043
01:06:52,653 --> 01:06:54,597
[Oh?]

1044
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:56,327
What is that?
Anaconda?

1045
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,179
I don't know what that is.

1046
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,868
Wait.

1047
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,004
I think I need to make an alliance.

1048
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:08,031
[Is he giving up on fishing?]

1049
01:07:08,032 --> 01:07:11,326
What's so important about fishing?

1050
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,928
- Making these memories is what's important.
- You're so right.

1051
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:21,674
[Cast their fishing rods aside...
to enjoy a steaming pot of abalone ramen.]

1052
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:25,748
[Abalone ramen that the boat captain
cooked for them himself.]

1053
01:07:26,865 --> 01:07:30,776
[This is what fishing is all about!]

1054
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:37,388
[A delish bite for Gwon Yeol.]

1055
01:07:39,148 --> 01:07:40,696
He's a really good eater.

1056
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:45,618
How did you eat it like that
when it's still so steaming hot?

1057
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,071
[I was hungry...]

1058
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,247
[No matter how good the ramen is,
shouldn't you still pay attention to fishing?]

1059
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,689
We're just getting started.

1060
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,230
- We're just about to get started.
- You're just eating ramen right now.

1061
01:07:58,231 --> 01:07:59,293
No, we're going to get started
as soon as we finish eating this ramen.

1062
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:01,978
We're about to get started.
We're almost done with our preparations.

1063
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:08,168
Where did Min Jong go?

1064
01:08:10,718 --> 01:08:13,130
He's battling his motion sickness right now.

1065
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:18,593
- He must have really bad motion sickness.
- It's a battle with motion sickness for him.

1066
01:08:20,692 --> 01:08:24,036
[Min Jong is battling his bout
of motion sickness?]

1067
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:30,883
Why don't you spread out some life vests
and lie down for a while?

1068
01:08:30,884 --> 01:08:33,309
- I don't think I can even move right now.
- I think I might've gotten something.

1069
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,669
- Sitting like that... it helps?
- Yeah, I need to stay just like this.

1070
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,931
You poor thing.

1071
01:08:42,932 --> 01:08:44,696
- Min Jong.
- Yes?

1072
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:47,724
- Why don't you come and fish?
- Min Jong can't fish right now.

1073
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:49,731
He can't do anything right now.
He doesn't even have the energy to talk.

1074
01:08:49,732 --> 01:08:52,716
[Is Min Jong going to give up
on his fishing mission?]

1075
01:08:54,356 --> 01:08:56,621
Come on, shark!
Come take the bait!

1076
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:00,344
I thought she was calling out my name.

1077
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:03,706
[Blank Ji is still relentless about
wanting to catch her shark.]

1078
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,564
[Could it be?]

1079
01:09:12,556 --> 01:09:14,392
I really got something.

1080
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:17,942
Gary!
I really did get something.

1081
01:09:17,943 --> 01:09:21,817
- We don't know that for sure right now.
- I'm totally serious!

1082
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:25,308
Gary!
I'm serious, Gary!

1083
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:30,223
I got a sea eel!

1084
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:32,868
[It's an eel!]

1085
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,310
I got an eel!

1086
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:40,266
[Blank Ji catches an all-natural sea eel
instead of her shark.]

1087
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:46,970
[She really is our lucky Blank Ji!]

1088
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:49,757
See?
I told you that I caught something!

1089
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:53,716
[Not just anything,
but an arm length sea eel!]

1090
01:09:53,717 --> 01:09:57,000
- What do I do with this now?
- How did you get it, Ji Hyo?

1091
01:09:57,001 --> 01:10:00,339
[Kim-Enthusiastic grabs the fish for Blank Ji,
who's afraid of the fish.]

1092
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,119
- You just felt a tug?
- Yeah.

1093
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:04,970
This thing is really strong.

1094
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:08,521
[The eel wraps it's body around
Kim-Enthusiastic's arm.]

1095
01:10:08,522 --> 01:10:11,051
Not only does she catch a large fish,
but she catches an eel!

1096
01:10:15,095 --> 01:10:17,720
[Over 50cm long!]

1097
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:22,101
That's not just the size of your hand,
but it's longer than your own arm!

1098
01:10:22,799 --> 01:10:25,224
You remember what you said about
wanting me to catch you a shark?

1099
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,537
Come on, Great White Shark!

1100
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,601
I'm really great at casting out the line.
I'm unbeatable when it comes to that.

1101
01:10:36,636 --> 01:10:39,847
Are you standing there patting
yourself on the back right now?

1102
01:10:41,021 --> 01:10:43,875
Hang on a minute.
Look at my rod right now.

1103
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:45,545
See how it's being dragged down?

1104
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:48,194
- Look at that right now.
- That's what mine felt like earlier.

1105
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:51,391
- Look at that.
- I think you got something.

1106
01:10:56,522 --> 01:11:00,231
It's too light wheeling it back in
for there to be a fish on the other end.

1107
01:11:04,182 --> 01:11:05,772
I can feel something pulling!

1108
01:11:05,773 --> 01:11:09,197
[Could there be something on
the other end of the pole?]

1109
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:14,816
I got some seaweed!

1110
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:17,844
[Nice and plump seaweed.]

1111
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,993
Can't you get any credit for
catching that?

1112
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:26,298
[Hope you take that and make a delicious
pot of seaweed soup for yourself.]

1113
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:30,382
- Song Ji Hyo just succeeded her mission.
- Seriously?

1114
01:11:31,682 --> 01:11:34,703
- She caught an eel.
- She caught an eel?

1115
01:11:34,704 --> 01:11:37,072
Then I should try fishing for eels.

1116
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:40,181
She caught an eel that's
longer than her arm in length.

1117
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:43,086
Then why am I not able to
catch anything?

1118
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,090
This is the only boat where no one
has caught anything yet.

1119
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:47,818
It's because Jae Suk is onboard the boat.

1120
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,562
There's that old saying...
if someone of bad luck gets on a boat...

1121
01:11:52,284 --> 01:11:53,675
It's not me, but it's because
of Seung Soo.

1122
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,870
He's the icon of misfortune.

1123
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:59,117
[Icon of misfortune- Ryu Goofball.]

1124
01:12:01,842 --> 01:12:03,140
Stay very quiet.

1125
01:12:03,141 --> 01:12:05,770
What's going on?
Seung Soo is getting a bite?

1126
01:12:07,746 --> 01:12:11,243
[He may be getting a bite!
Staying quiet as to not to scare it away.]

1127
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,822
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- What?

1128
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:22,580
What else do you expect for me to do?
One of us has to get something.

1129
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,570
[Carefully lifts up the fishing line...]

1130
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:30,727
[But it's already gone.]

1131
01:12:32,096 --> 01:12:33,993
That was an eel.

1132
01:12:36,636 --> 01:12:39,353
[Evidence that it was an eel that
had been nibbling on the bait.]

1133
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:44,371
[In that case... steal!]

1134
01:12:44,372 --> 01:12:47,161
[Yoo Hyuk's steal.]

1135
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,061
You know that's not right.

1136
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:55,778
Why are you coming over this way?
What are you doing?

1137
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:58,504
- I can't believe you guys.
- I heard that there are eels over here.

1138
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:01,400
You guys took my spot.

1139
01:13:02,196 --> 01:13:04,712
[Original spot owner, Seung Soo,
is shoved back to the corner of the boat.]

1140
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,677
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing!

1141
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:14,011
If you do that,
it's going to tangle up our fishing lines!

1142
01:13:18,382 --> 01:13:20,964
Why are you dipping it right next to mine!

1143
01:13:20,965 --> 01:13:24,250
- What do you think you're doing?
- I heard that there are eels in this area.

1144
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:29,962
[Just then!]

1145
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:34,738
[Will it save this tall
and lanky fishing hyena?]

1146
01:13:35,564 --> 01:13:38,606
[That's what we thought...]

1147
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,521
I thought my bloated worm
was a small eel for a moment!

1148
01:13:44,707 --> 01:13:46,965
[Just then, Yoo Hyuk gets a bite
on his fishing line too!]

1149
01:13:47,981 --> 01:13:51,435
[Another bloated worm.]

1150
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:55,797
So this is why people love to fish.

1151
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:59,514
- Did you catch anything?
- I don't know if I even got a nibble.

1152
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,183
- What's that?
- That's where the eel went!

1153
01:14:04,563 --> 01:14:07,691
[A staff member was fishing out of boredom,
and caught a fish that they're hoping for.]

1154
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:10,233
[It's a rock trout!]

1155
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:13,705
- What the heck?
- I can't believe he caught something.

1156
01:14:13,706 --> 01:14:15,841
Why did you catch our fish?
It would've worked its way down to us.

1157
01:14:17,243 --> 01:14:20,025
[All he did was put
a fishing line in the water.]

1158
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:29,921
[An opportunity has finally come
knocking on Joo Hwan's door!]

1159
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:35,115
[Could it be more seaweed for
Joo Hwan too?]

1160
01:14:36,743 --> 01:14:40,053
[It's a real live fish!]

1161
01:14:44,657 --> 01:14:47,296
[A lively rock trout!]

1162
01:14:48,478 --> 01:14:51,329
Okay, I got it.
Take a good look at it, Kwang Soo.

1163
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,558
Stop it.

1164
01:14:53,559 --> 01:14:55,944
- Take a good look.
- There must be some fish in these waters.

1165
01:14:55,945 --> 01:14:58,294
I didn't think there were any
in the water.

1166
01:14:58,295 --> 01:14:59,971
[Joo Hwan saves his image at
the very end.]

1167
01:15:02,092 --> 01:15:05,020
When am I ever going to catch my fish?

1168
01:15:06,953 --> 01:15:10,096
[Joo Hwan closes out the mission by
catching their fourth fish for the day.]

1169
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:16,820
[With Joo Hwan's catch,
the mission now comes to a close.]

1170
01:15:16,821 --> 01:15:18,695
I didn't catch anything this time either.

1171
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,958
But at least one of you from this boat
was able to catch something.

1172
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:23,777
What does that have to do with me?

1173
01:15:23,778 --> 01:15:27,080
- That has nothing to do with me.
- I wanted to be the one to catch something.

1174
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,789
That's scary looking.

1175
01:15:33,002 --> 01:15:36,517
- Is it bigger than the size of your hand?
- Of course it is.

1176
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:38,456
[Joo Hwan is the last one to be abstained
from this round of elimination.]

1177
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:40,229
How does it feel?

1178
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:43,307
Don't even talk to me if you haven't
caught anything.

1179
01:15:44,614 --> 01:15:48,155
[Even Joo Hwan is showing the signs of
the side effects by starting to act cocky.]

1180
01:15:48,156 --> 01:15:50,713
Look at the way he's behaving.

1181
01:15:51,528 --> 01:15:54,791
[The ease of the victors.]

1182
01:15:56,057 --> 01:16:00,342
- You have to snap back the rod.
- Moment you feel it, snap the line back.

1183
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,317
[Fishing imitation by someone
who's never caught anything before.]

1184
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:15,303
- My steps feel so much lighter now.
- Are you reliving that moment again?

1185
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:18,107
My hands can still feel the
pull of the line.

1186
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:20,437
Really?
You should just give it a rest now.

1187
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:24,201
- You're going overboard.
- Have you ever caught anything before?

1188
01:16:24,202 --> 01:16:26,043
One would think that you just
caught a shark.

1189
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:29,509
I can't listen to your talking anymore.
This is going overboard.

1190
01:16:32,497 --> 01:16:35,036
You should go get checked out at the hospital
if your hands are still feeling tingly.

1191
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,847
- Fourth fish has been caught.
- It's all over now.

1192
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:42,985
- Min Jong, fourth fish has been caught.
- Who was it?

1193
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:45,417
I wonder if Min Jong is doing okay?

1194
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,583
- Is it over? Please let's get off this boat.
- Okay, we'll go back.

1195
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:54,008
Once you start feeling sick like that,
it's absolute misery.

1196
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,513
- We're going to head back.
- Yes, let's please go back.

1197
01:16:57,565 --> 01:16:59,321
It's all over now.

1198
01:17:04,526 --> 01:17:08,932
[But, just then...]

1199
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:13,660
[There's a fish dangling from Min Jong's line
that he left at the back of the boat!]

1200
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:16,502
He really did catch a rock fish.

1201
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:22,038
[But he doesn't even have the energy
to feel happy about the fish.]

1202
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:24,473
- Let's let the fish go.
- You must have really bad motion sickness.

1203
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:27,022
I don't even go out on a river.

1204
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:33,462
Min Jong's totally out for the count.

1205
01:17:33,463 --> 01:17:37,396
- Poor Min Jong.
- He just has really bad motion sickness.

1206
01:17:37,955 --> 01:17:40,168
He did mention that he gets
really bad motion sickness.

1207
01:17:40,638 --> 01:17:43,274
- Some people get really sick like that.
- Are you okay?

1208
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:47,827
He's going to be feeling sick all day.

1209
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:50,123
We're here.
Min Jong, we're back at the dock.

1210
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:57,590
You should feel a little better
once you get off the boat.

1211
01:18:03,481 --> 01:18:06,720
[The boat that Min Jong is on is the
first boat to get back to the dock.]

1212
01:18:08,745 --> 01:18:12,236
[Min Jong rushes off the boat even before
the boat is docked in its lot.]

1213
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,245
Let's go.

1214
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:27,957
[Will Min Jong be okay?]

1215
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:39,397
I have to keep up this pretense
to the very end, don't I?

1216
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:42,066
[What!]

1217
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:45,145
[He's putting on an act?]

1218
01:18:45,146 --> 01:18:47,027
It would've been okay if I could've
just caught the fish two minutes earlier.

1219
01:18:48,386 --> 01:18:52,377
I'm one hundred percent positive that
those three aren't suspicious of me.

1220
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,465
I totally have them fooled right now.

1221
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:03,671
[Out on the mud flats earlier
this morning.]

1222
01:19:07,856 --> 01:19:12,333
[The man who was ambitiously
searching for those crabs...]

1223
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,309
[His reason for working so hard to make
sure that his crab won the race?]

1224
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:27,226
Since you came in at first place,
it seems you'll be safe this time around.

1225
01:19:27,227 --> 01:19:29,058
Yeah, I was able to avoid it
this time.

1226
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:30,999
You're not going to get in my
way, are you?

1227
01:19:33,392 --> 01:19:36,060
[At the recent fishing mission...]

1228
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:41,755
[The man who couldn't focus on his fishing
because of his extreme motion sickness...]

1229
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:45,825
[However...]

1230
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:54,006
[Recruiting the help of the boat captain to
catch the fish away from others' eyes.]

1231
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:00,650
All three of these experts are trying,
but they still can't catch anything.

1232
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:08,492
[His motion sickness was all just an act
to avoid other people's suspicion.]

1233
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:13,362
[That's how he was able to completely
fool everyone on the boat.]

1234
01:20:15,918 --> 01:20:18,157
Putting on this act is really difficult.

1235
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:25,283
I have to keep up this act
to the very end.

1236
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:30,401
I have to keep up this act.
Don't laugh. You have to look serious.

1237
01:20:30,402 --> 01:20:33,634
[The reason why he went through
all this trouble is because...]

1238
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:40,729
[Today, you are... a mafia member.]

1239
01:20:42,819 --> 01:20:47,216
[Mafia, Kim Min Jong,
hiding behind a lamb's mask.]

1240
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:56,074
[Continuing to put on his motion sickness act
even after having gotten off the boat.]

1241
01:20:56,075 --> 01:20:59,482
Just two minutes sooner,
and I would've caught the fourth fish.

1242
01:21:00,081 --> 01:21:02,051
[Disappointed that he wasn't able to
win the free ticket from the elimination.]

1243
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:07,187
I think I got them totally fooled
for the moment, don't you think?

1244
01:21:08,144 --> 01:21:10,913
[He actually seems happy about
his deceit?]

1245
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:15,145
- Min Jong's feeling really sick right now.
- Is he okay?

1246
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,003
Do you know something?

1247
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:21,856
Can I pretend to smoke a cigarette?

1248
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:25,305
['Mafia fools the civilians'-
Starring Kim Min Jong.]

1249
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:30,323
- He has really bad motion sickness.
- Min Jong says he gets it bad.

1250
01:21:32,157 --> 01:21:35,115
Okay, take the camera off of me too now.

1251
01:21:35,116 --> 01:21:37,463
[Must you really go that far?]

1252
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:41,359
[Ordering his VJ to leave him to make
his acting seem even more believable.]

1253
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:46,286
We were never really that interested
in catching any fish from the beginning.

1254
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:49,295
We were just happy about eating
all the fresh abalone.

1255
01:21:49,296 --> 01:21:52,217
We just decided to fish when we had some time
leftover after all the eating and singing.

1256
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:53,674
But Suk Jin caught something as soon as
he dropped his line in.

1257
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,498
- I got a bite as soon as I dropped my line.
- That's amazing.

1258
01:21:56,533 --> 01:21:58,731
So is it that the ones who caught something
are always so chatty?

1259
01:22:00,947 --> 01:22:03,482
Even though that may have seemed like the end,
that was actually just the beginning.

1260
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:04,984
I don't even have anything to say.

1261
01:22:06,136 --> 01:22:09,788
[Just then, Min Jong slowly makes his way
back toward the other members.]

1262
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:14,162
[Keeping up with his act
with his head bent down towards his chest.]

1263
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:21,018
- Come sit down over here.
- Are you feeling okay?

1264
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,475
- Min Jong.
- Are you okay?

1265
01:22:26,564 --> 01:22:29,696
- Yesterday and today...
- He's had a tough couple of days.

1266
01:22:29,697 --> 01:22:32,623
I was thinking earlier today that he is
the most likeliest mafia suspect.

1267
01:22:32,624 --> 01:22:35,272
- I don't think he is anymore.
- But after this today, I no longer think so.

1268
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:36,915
He didn't seem to have any interest
in winning this mission whatsoever.

1269
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,291
He didn't seem to show any interest
in fishing whatsoever from the beginning.

1270
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:44,344
- But that could be his plan.
- He just wanted to eat some abalones.

1271
01:22:45,308 --> 01:22:48,376
- He was just excited to eat the abalone.
- And he got sick almost right after that.

1272
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:51,499
[Suk Jin and Jong Kook sound convinced
of Min Jong's innocence.]

1273
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,755
Once you start to feel sick,
it really makes you feel miserable.

1274
01:22:53,756 --> 01:22:56,043
He was fine until we ate the abalone.

1275
01:22:56,044 --> 01:22:57,350
[This is the art of 26 years of
acting experience.]

1276
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:58,801
Maybe you have very bad indigestion.

1277
01:22:58,802 --> 01:23:03,506
I will now tell you how many mafia members
are still left in the game amongst the group.

1278
01:23:03,507 --> 01:23:05,638
[Time to reveal the remaining number
of surviving mafia members.]

1279
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:08,363
There are currently...

1280
01:23:10,008 --> 01:23:12,284
a total of...

1281
01:23:13,949 --> 01:23:15,574
three mafia members still left
in the game.

1282
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:18,110
[Still a total of three mafia members
left remaining in the game.]

1283
01:23:18,111 --> 01:23:22,464
If even one mafia is still left remaining at
the end of the game, then it's their win.

1284
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:25,541
[Even if one mafia is left remaining,
then it's the mafia's win of the game.]

1285
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,729
Don't you think that Jae Suk could be mafia?

1286
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:39,991
- Jae Suk was extra chatty today.
- No, Suk Jin.

1287
01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:42,372
Look me in the eye.
It's not me.

1288
01:23:42,373 --> 01:23:45,735
I think there's at least one mafia member
left amongst the Running Man members.

1289
01:23:45,736 --> 01:23:47,891
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- It really isn't me.

1290
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,697
[The devious Giraffe is always a suspect.]

1291
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:52,992
You can just vote me out since I didn't
place anything during our last mission.

1292
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,981
We are going to vote you out.

1293
01:23:57,005 --> 01:24:00,710
It would really be funny if we eliminated
Seung Soo, but he ends up being a civilian.

1294
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:03,579
I'm telling you that it really isn't me.

1295
01:24:04,443 --> 01:24:06,919
If he really isn't, then this really would be
an injustice against him.

1296
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,672
- It really would be unfair to you then.
- Everyone thinks that you're mafia.

1297
01:24:10,673 --> 01:24:12,568
But what if you end up being
a civilian in the end?

1298
01:24:14,504 --> 01:24:17,874
[But is it really time to vote him out?]

1299
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:19,600
You have no idea what you're
doing right now, do you?

1300
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,744
- You really think that I'm it?
- What do you think of Jae Suk, Seung Soo?

1301
01:24:24,315 --> 01:24:26,897
It's not Jae Suk either. I'm sure of it.
I'm pretty sure that Sang Hwa is it though.

1302
01:24:26,898 --> 01:24:29,260
[Seung Soo suspects Sang Hwa
of being a mafia member.]

1303
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:31,520
- You!
- I'm not.

1304
01:24:35,324 --> 01:24:40,113
[Every word that comes out of his mouth
ends up sounding extremely suspicious.]

1305
01:24:41,473 --> 01:24:42,883
No, I'm not.

1306
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:46,041
- I think it's Lee Sang Hwa.
- I'm telling you that it's her.

1307
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:49,277
The reason being, I think that at least
one of us women has to be one.

1308
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:52,392
But why does that have to be me?

1309
01:24:52,393 --> 01:24:54,009
Lee Sang Hwa.

1310
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:58,467
[Just sit still, won't you?]

1311
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,776
- You're in no position to say that.
- I want to see if she is or not.

1312
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:06,080
- I vote that Lee Sang Hwa is it.
- I vote that you are.

1313
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:11,884
[Sang Hwa thinks that Blank Ji is casting
the suspicion on her because she's mafia?]

1314
01:25:11,885 --> 01:25:14,369
[Did she just nod her head?]

1315
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:18,995
[Is that a sign that
Sang Hwa's guess is correct?]

1316
01:25:18,996 --> 01:25:21,206
And you were working really hard
to catch that fish earlier.

1317
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:24,803
-I think one of those guys are it.
- It has to be at least one of them.

1318
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:27,999
Don't worry about us up here,
and you just worry about yourselves.

1319
01:25:28,664 --> 01:25:31,131
Just because you caught
a single fish earlier...

1320
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:38,271
- You just caught a tiny rock trout.
- No, it was this big.

1321
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:40,821
I thought it was just a minnow at first.

1322
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:45,090
You have one minute left on the clock.

1323
01:25:45,091 --> 01:25:46,240
[One minute left before they decide
who they want to vote out of the game.]

1324
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:49,670
Dong Joon was on the receiving end of
a lot of suspicions earlier in the day.

1325
01:25:49,671 --> 01:25:52,893
- I think it's Dong Joon.
- It really isn't me.

1326
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:56,700
[Is Dong Joon being really quite today because
he wants to avoid everyone's suspicions?]

1327
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:58,803
In my opinion, I think it's Jae Suk.

1328
01:25:58,804 --> 01:26:01,218
- Jae Suk is...
- I'm just a civilian!

1329
01:26:01,219 --> 01:26:04,724
Jae Suk kept insisting that
Seung Soo is guilty all day today.

1330
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:07,378
It is a little strange how he has been
so vocal about Seung Soo all day.

1331
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:09,931
I really think that it's Jae Suk.

1332
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,140
- I really think that it's Jae Suk.
- I'm only standing up because my legs hurt.

1333
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:19,566
[Any slight movement will earn
these people each other's suspicion.]

1334
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:22,184
- I vote for Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk has been acting strange.

1335
01:26:22,185 --> 01:26:24,435
This is so frustrating.
It really isn't me.

1336
01:26:24,436 --> 01:26:27,145
- I swear. I'm a civilian.
- I don't know about that.

1337
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:29,600
I'm telling you, Gary.
It really isn't me.

1338
01:26:30,347 --> 01:26:33,274
[Still keeping up his act of being in pain.]

1339
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:35,776
We will now take your vote.

1340
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:37,919
- Gary.
- Can you leave me out of this?

1341
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:40,998
[Gary- 0 votes.]

1342
01:26:40,999 --> 01:26:44,126
- Lee Sang Hwa.
- It really isn't me.

1343
01:26:44,127 --> 01:26:46,717
[Lee Sang Hwa- Three votes.]

1344
01:26:46,718 --> 01:26:49,837
- Dong Joon.
- I don't know about him.

1345
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,825
[Dong Joon- Four votes.]

1346
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,112
[Kwang Soo- 0 votes.]

1347
01:26:55,113 --> 01:26:57,313
- You're really going to regret this.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1348
01:26:57,314 --> 01:27:01,085
[Jae Suk- Four votes.]

1349
01:27:01,086 --> 01:27:03,384
- I'm telling you that I'm a civilian!
- Ryu Seung Soo.

1350
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,876
All the mafia members are
plotting together right now.

1351
01:27:05,877 --> 01:27:08,784
- You guys just let Seung Soo off the hook.
- You guys are very intelligent.

1352
01:27:08,785 --> 01:27:11,547
You're like a persistent weed.

1353
01:27:11,548 --> 01:27:14,147
[Seung Soo's very persistent existence.]

1354
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:17,872
[Min Jong gets zero votes with
his perfect show of acting.]

1355
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,000
- Who received the most number of votes?
- Jae Suk and Dong Joon.

1356
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:26,324
- It really isn't me.
- It really isn't me either.

1357
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:30,990
- No last minute change of minds?
- Mafia member is... Dong Joon!

1358
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:35,561
[Mafia member is Dong Joon?]

1359
01:27:35,562 --> 01:27:38,477
- Only one way to tell.
- It really isn't me!

1360
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:45,818
[Enthusiastic Dong Joon has been unusually
quite all day... his reason being?]

1361
01:27:49,522 --> 01:27:52,161
[Dong Joon was a civilian!]

1362
01:27:52,162 --> 01:27:54,875
[They fail to capture a mafia member.]

1363
01:27:54,876 --> 01:27:56,654
You should've been more insistent
that you weren't it!

1364
01:27:56,655 --> 01:28:00,812
[The members are now trying to
thwart the blame onto Dong Joon.]

1365
01:28:00,813 --> 01:28:04,353
Pay attention. Those of you that kept accusing
me and Dong Joon are the real mafia members.

1366
01:28:04,836 --> 01:28:06,584
Didn't Dong Joon accuse Jae Suk?

1367
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:09,369
No, I suspected Dong Joon.

1368
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:14,076
[You die, and I die...
these two accused each other!]

1369
01:28:16,236 --> 01:28:18,778
The mafia member is... Jae Suk!

1370
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:22,943
[Could Yoo Jae Suk be a
mafia member?]

1371
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:25,970
- I'm positive that it's Jae Suk.
- It's isn't me, Dong Joon.

1372
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:28,809
[Could Jae Suk be one of my allies?]

1373
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:33,363
- And even Gary...
- It isn't me!

1374
01:28:36,285 --> 01:28:41,130
[Could Jae Suk have been extra chatty today
to cover up his anxiety?]

1375
01:28:41,131 --> 01:28:43,912
[Three mafia members still remain.]

1376
01:28:43,913 --> 01:28:46,221
[If Jae Suk isn't a mafia,
then it puts the civilians in grave danger!]

1377
01:28:46,222 --> 01:29:00,401
[Jae Suk's real identity
is none other than...]
