it's the day of the athletic competition?

Taecyeon couldn't be here with us today due to
a scheduling conflict with his weekend drama.

60
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:38,155
But a nice older lady seems to be here
to fill in his spot.

61
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,339

- Hello.
- I really didn't think that you'd come today.

65
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,416
- I couldn't miss out on this.
- I can't believe that Nichkhun came.

66
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,869
I had to come and see you.

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,818
I'm so happy to hear that you came to see me,
but when it comes to Running Man...

68
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,836
- I think this may be my 7th time on the show.
- It might be closer to ten times on the show.

69
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:07,995
You even came with us to Thailand,
and that episode was such a huge hit.

70
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,138
Our show became such a huge hit after that,
and you became pretty big too, so it's nice.

71
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,219
You know that you've become quite
successful since that episode aired.

[Aww... how cute.]

75
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,547
If you're happy with your life,
then what else could you wish for?

76
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:28,466
What's going on today?

77
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,009
- What's what going on?
- What is she up to?

78
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,154
- The weekend dramas are on right now.

we've all been waiting for.]

- She has the day off.
- She has the day off?

- Yes, she's sleeping.
- She's sleeping?

84
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,062

will they be showing us this time?]

[His old 'door' dance moves which
he hasn't shown off in a while.]

<i>Hip hop isn't all that difficult.</i>

102
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:06,551
<i>Just think of there being an imaginary door,
and you just need to step through the door.</i>

103
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:10,373
[One step through the imaginary door,
and the dance move is over.]

104
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,869
Wow, I can't believe that
you're all here!

105
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,665
We've got the members of 2NE1,
and the two older delinquent boys here.

106
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,891
- What did you say?
- You're saying that you're not a delinquent?

107
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,513
You look like the bully that I used to see
during my school picnic outings.

108
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,377
I dressed with care today.

109
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,595
Is that tiger on your shirt
one of our guests today or something?

110
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,856
[MC Yoo's bratty behavior is trying
to put the tiger to shame.]

111
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,824
- Who's the participant here today?
- I am the Tiger!

112
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,458
What are you trying to do?

113
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,786
I'm just trying to live up to
my character.

114
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:48,533
This is seriously...

115
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,483
This is going to be an embarrassment.

116
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,681
- We want to see who the next guests are!
- Do they really have to come out?

117
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,777
- Ugh, seriously.
- We want to see who it is.

118
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,141
Let's welcome our last group of guests.

119
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,690
[The final group of idols who will
be the destroyers of the competition.]

120
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,365
[Wait, that song is...]

121
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:10,487
[They're idols?]

122
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:17,819
[Yoon Jong Shin and idols...

[Jong Shin- 45 ; Suk Jin- 48.

125
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:33,056
What are you guys doing right now?

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,958
[What kind of a performance do these
ancestor idols have in store for them?]

127
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:42,561
[Not too bad of a start.]

128
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:52,727
[Above anyone's expectation.]

129
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:58,939
[Ah... those were the days.]

130
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:02,501
None of you are in sync!

131
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,164
[Even though they've practiced the dance,
they can't remember the moves.]

132
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:07,921
[Crab dance?]

133
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,736
[Whatever, let's just circle around.]

134
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:22,370
[Jong Shin is finally starting to look happy.]

135
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:31,410
Okay, thank you for the performance.

136
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,264
[Protesting the end to their performance.]

137
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,059
- Your time is up.
- We had a grand finale!

138
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,040
- We still have this move left!
- We enjoyed your show.

139
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,872
Jong Shin, you should turn around and
take a look at what's on the screen.

140
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:48,734
[Jong Shin, 20 years ago in his prime.]

141
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,925
He's a part of our team as the leader.

142
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:57,318
Where are Yang Hyun Suk and
Park Jin Young?

143
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,596
Why do you ask?

144
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,671
I came out on the show because I was told
that they would be here today.

145
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,334
[He really didn't know...]

146
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,730
Thus, we have a total of three
teams today.

147
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:11,850
2PM, 2NE1, and Mystic89.

148
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,811
You will be divided into the three teams
that you see on stage here

149
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:19,340
and we will now start our
2014 Idol Athletic Competition!

150
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:23,706
[2014 Idol Athletic Competition.]

151
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:27,278
<i>Sirs?
Please move faster and come this way.</i>

152
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,456
Your shirt is made up of all our colors.

153
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:34,067
- I see that you're right. My shirt...
- Your shirt is all the team colors.

154
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:37,365
[The best kept secret that they're all
just starting to realize.]

155
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,962
- Ah, because there are three teams?
- Yes, that's right.

156
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,168
- Your shirt is hurting my eyes.
- Why?

157
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:43,893
- Your shirt is hurting my eyes.
- You should just go away.

158
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:46,636
<i>You will be traveling to your various
destinations in your team car.</i>

159
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:50,427
- What about Jae Suk?
- MC Yoo will have to drive by himself.

160
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,728
What? Why do I have to drive by myself when
everyone else is traveling with their teams?

161
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,646
- Are you a spy?
- What did you say?

162
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:58,492
- Are you a mafia member or a spy?
- Why would you travel alone otherwise?

163
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,969
<i>MC Yoo will have to be the first one
to arrive at each location</i>

164
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,778
<i>and get all the preparations ready
for each game and mission.</i>

165
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,686
Is he being punished or something?

166
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:09,383
[Must have everything prepped in
order for the show to go on smoothly.]

167
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,835
- I can't believe this. This is absurd.
- That's what you have to do as the MC.

168
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,718
[It's a lonely path that
MC Yoo must travel on.]

169
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,914
[On their way to first mission location.]

170
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:24,493
[Blank Ji is singing a duet with Jun K.]

171
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:28,095
[A true fan is showing her roots.
Blank Ji knows all the lyrics to a 2PM song.]

172
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:31,409
[Blank Ji is acknowledged as
a true fan of 2PM.]

173
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,896
That was awesome.

174
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:41,236
Just what are we doing today that
I have to drive there by myself?

175
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,190
How can I not be a part
of an athletic competition?

176
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:49,786
Seriously... how can you make me
dress in an outfit like this

177
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:52,262
when we have 2NE1 and 2PM
as our guests?

178
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,082
[It actually looks pretty good on you.]

179
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,154
We're here.

180
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,924
[Lone MC Yoo arrives at the destination.]

181
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,789
- Please come to the MC spot.
- Seriously.

182
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,878
What is all this?
Huh?

183
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,465
- And this is for you too.
- What is this?

184
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,984
[A vital tool for an MC-
A mini megaphone.]

185
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:15,967
- The first mission is a City Marathon.
- What's that?

186
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,001
All five members of each team will have to
come up with some sort of an act that is

187
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:22,355
befitting of the city and will have to run
in a marathon relay form.

188
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:27,453
And you will need to follow them along
and keep announcing what's going on

189
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,679
and lead them on to what they need to do.

190
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,965
[Iconic thoughtful MC Yoo-
A whole new way of MC'ing is on your way.]

191
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:36,075
- Let's go!
- You go on ahead, Ji Hyo.

192
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,169
Please pick up your speed.

193
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:44,373
Yes, that's right.
This is an athletic competition, so run.

194
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,771
- I think we need to hurry on over there.
- Are we in a rush?

195
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,261
It's 2PM.
Just as I had thought... very nice.

196
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,407
Ma'am, you must hurry.

197
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,651
Yes, that's right.
That's the 2PM I know.

198
00:11:56,652 --> 00:12:00,089
- We're the first ones here.
- When it comes to athleticism...

199
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,878
The competitiveness of this team
is so admirable.

200
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,592
[Team 2PM is overflowing with energy.]

201
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,500
That's right.
That's the spirit.

202
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,990
This is the energy that we need to see.

203
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,550
What are you guys doing when everyone else
is running over to their positions?

204
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,660
Come on, you need to hurry.

205
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:23,674
Come on, pick up the pace.
You need to hurry it up.

206
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:31,248
[This team looks as though they're about to
start an office athletic competition.]

207
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,673
- Mystic! Mystic!
- Come this way, Team Mystic.

208
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:37,254
- Come this way.
- No, our spot is in the middle.

209
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,554
[They're greedy for the center spot even
though they were the last ones to arrive.]

210
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:42,194
What are you guys doing?

211
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:48,942
Anyway, thank you to everyone
for being here today.

212
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,848
As for your first mission,
it's going to be a marathon.

213
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:53,215
- It's a relay marathon.
- Seriously?

214
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:58,316
- It's a real marathon?
- You'll be running in a relay form.

215
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:01,564
There will be several missions along the way,
and you'll have to complete each mission.

216
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,292
The first team to cross the finish line after
completing all the mission wins the race.

217
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,350
The marathon will be done in teams.

218
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,979
- How long is the path?
- How would I know that?

219
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,564
- Stop asking me such useless questions.
- Why are you being so rude?

220
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,428
[Crabby MC Yoo]

221
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,792
- No more of these types of questions.
- What happened to the old Yoo Jae Suk?

222
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:19,712
I thought you were
supposed to be a very caring MC.

223
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,890
- Please step back.
- Who do you think you're trying to hit?

224
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,615
- What is that?
- Is that for each of the teams?

225
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,707
[Each team's music video tape
will be used as their batons.]

226
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:35,268
The last runner must run into the editing room
and play the video inside the case

227
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,452
and that music video will be played on an
endless replay mode for the rest of the day.

228
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:43,488
[The winning team's music video will be on
replay mode on Prism Tower's screen.]

229
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,058
- That sounds great for the winner.
- We have to make sure to win.

230
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,620
Run until your lungs burst!

231
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,264
- That's so awesome.
- That's so great.

232
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,139
[An unbelievable offer to the singers.]

233
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,294
[Their competitive streak is
up even higher.]

234
00:13:56,295 --> 00:14:00,319
Okay, then I need everyone
to get in their position.

235
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,111
- Where is it?
- You need to tell us where we need to go.

236
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:06,196
- Just figure that out for yourselves.
- Tell us where we need to be.

237
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:09,264
Stop relying on your MC for everything,
and figure things out for yourselves.

238
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,061
- Where do we have to go?
- Just start walking and follow the cameras.

239
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:17,590
[MC Yoo is forcing them
to be more self-reliant.]

240
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,047
Only the first runners will remain here, and
the rest of you will have to find your spots.

241
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:25,019
[Who will be the lucky winners to
fill up this huge screen?]

242
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,717
When you round this corner,
around the corner of this building...

243
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,350
you're going to see a coffee shop.

244
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:37,316
You'll have to go into the shop and buy
a hot cup of Americano.

245
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,684
- Then give us some money.
- Look at him moving to the inner lane.

246
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,362
[Jung Chi slyly sneaks over
to the inner lane position.]

247
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,966
- Most men would concede that spot to a girl.
- Yes, that's right.

248
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,950
Why are you guys being like this?

249
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,161
[The inner lane is mine!]

250
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,195
What's that over there?

251
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,675
Number two is over there.

252
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,931
- Oh my goodness.
- What are those dogs doing there?

253
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,504
I see a bunch of dogs over there.

254
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:08,759
[What is the mission that they're going to
have to do with these large dogs?]

255
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,201
- I bet they've got something planned.
- Look at how big they are.

256
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:18,416
- Do you like animals?
- I like cats.

257
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,148
But dogs this size...
On my goodness!

258
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,959
Hi.

259
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,020
What do I do?

260
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:29,323
[In reality, Sandara is afraid of dogs.
What is she going to do?]

261
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:31,442
I think she's afraid of dogs.

262
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,582
The mission that you will have
to do here is

263
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,917
one member of the team will have to run
with the other member on their piggyback.

264
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,401
- Can I switch my spot?
- What are we going to do?

265
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:47,694
No, it's okay.

266
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,036
[Panic]

267
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:55,229
[But... there's someone who's more devastated
than any other at this bit of news.]

268
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,369
[Dear God...]

269
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,800
Is it going to be a pop quiz or something?

270
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,779
You have to run with these flippers on.

271
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,964
[R4- Run with flippers on.]

272
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,462
This is what a person naturally looks like
when they run with these things on.

273
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,145
[The final runner's mission.]

274
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:25,610
You have to run to the control room on
the sub terrain level to hand over your tape.

275
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:31,237
[Run to the control room on the sub terrain
level and hand over the tape to win.]

276
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:35,857
[Just who will be the winning team to
fill up this gigantic screen for the day?]

277
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,094
Okay everyone.

278
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:43,389
Okay, we will now be starting our marathon.
We've got Jung Chi, Park Bom, and Woo Young.

279
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,696
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes, we're ready.

280
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,603
Okay, ready...

281
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:53,387
set... not yet, Park Bom.

282
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:58,474
That's some fierce competitiveness.

283
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,222
Don't you think that you're
going overboard?

284
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,472
Ready, set... go!

285
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:08,573
[Idol Athletic Competition-
City Relay Marathon- Start!]

286
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:12,230
[MC Yoo also gets on his way on his bike.]

287
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:14,790
Woo Young, Jo Jung Chi, and Park Bom.

288
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,920
They're all well on their way.

289
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,908
[Current standing-
Jung Chi, Woo Young, Park Bom.]

290
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,683
Where is the second position?

291
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm at a total disadvantage.

292
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:33,981
[First mission-
Buy a steaming cup of Americano.]

293
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:39,005
- One cup of hot Americano, please.
- A hot cup of Americano.

294
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:44,760
You're not that far behind.
No need to lose hope for falling behind a bit.

295
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:50,089
[2NE1's Park Bom also arrives
at the coffee shop.]

296
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,245
Hello, one cup of Americano please.

297
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,909
Okay.

298
00:17:56,072 --> 00:18:00,282
Seriously, what am I doing on this bike?
I should be one of the runners!

299
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:03,050
Did everyone get their hot cup
of Americano?

300
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,002
I didn't order a cookie.

301
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,441
[In the end, he parks his bike
to enter the coffee shop himself.]

302
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,992
- Hello.
- What took you so long to get here?

303
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,471
As you may all already know, there's no reason
to feel nervous for being a little slow.

304
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,249
As soon as you get the coffee...
there's the coffee right now.

305
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,836
- You startled me.
- I see it coming.

306
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:24,543
You have to take the tray with you.

307
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,632
[Jung Chi, from Team Mystic89,
is the first to get on his way.]

308
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,564
Okay, here we go again.

309
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,727
[Woo Young is also headed towards
R2 in second place.]

310
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:45,539
This is really hot!

311
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,130
Wow, that's so hot!

312
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:51,011
Park Bom is taking her time, isn't she?

313
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:55,900
[Totally unexpected!
Team Mystic89 is in the lead!]

314
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,232
- Mystic89!
- Yeah!

315
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,737
Why isn't my team member coming?

316
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,998
- Mystic89!
- Mystic89!

317
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:06,212
No, not yet.
You can't pass it off yet.

318
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,192
You have to have the coffee
and the cookie first.

319
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,792
I have to drink this?

320
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:14,652
[This steaming cup of coffee?]

321
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,046
What did you say?

322
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,589
You have to drink it first.

323
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,357
I have to drink this whole cup?

324
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:23,984
- Hurry, Woo Young!
- Hurry up and drink it.

325

- Seriously?
- No, they don't.

[What are they going to do?
Neither Bom or Sandara drinks coffee.]

331
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:41,165
- If they have any coffee...
- They can't fall asleep?

332
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,914
- No, they can't.
- Do you have stuff going on tomorrow?

333
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,848
- No, we don't.
- Then they can sleep tomorrow.

334
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,299
Tell them to just study tonight.

335

[Navigation and personal cheerleader-
A diverse MC Yoo.]

337
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,052
The one thing I hate the most is running.

338
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,991
I hate running the most.

339
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:02,779
[First and second place holders are currently
struggling to finish their cups of coffee.]

340
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,010
- Can we drink it together?
- What did you get?

341
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:09,172
- Ouch, that's so hot!
- Run!

342
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:13,395
- You have to drink this whole thing.
- There's no need to feel disappointed.

343

- Your coffee may even be cool by now.
- I can't drink that.

344

- I have to drink this myself?
- You two can drink it together.

345
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,604
- I can't drink this.
- I can't drink coffee either.

346

[The problem is that neither one of them
can drink coffee.]

you have to shoot it into this basket.

359

Then you have to pick one of these dogs
and walk it over to R3.

[Come on, let's go!]

gulp down the coffee for 2NE1.]

[It bounced off the side!]

to make their shots.]

- Maybe against that tree?
- Where do we have to go?

445
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,442
- Can we sit on something while we wait?
- I can hang on this post.

[Runners in R4 are waiting anxiously.]

448

It's possible that the other team members
may be a while yet.

[They must answer MC Yoo's question.]

459
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:53,212
On your way to R4, there was something
about energy conservation.

460
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:58,794
The question is- Electricity is ___,
and the crude material is ___.

461
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:01,179
What are the missing words
in that question?

462
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,406
The answer was on your path to R4.

463
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:09,047
The question is- Electricity is 'blank',
and the crude material is 'blank'.

464
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:11,464
Electricity is...

465
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:16,849
Electricity has to be 'man-made',
and crude material is 'nature made'.

on my back.

[Giraffe transport with rock Jong Shin
is almost depleted of his energy.]

Wait!
Wait a second!

473
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:49,483

where I just had my surgery.

474

[A painful spot on his body...]

475

Someone help me!

478
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:05,664
I'm going to lose my balance if
you do that.

479
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,618
[Each and every step is purely
agonizing.]

480

[Team 2NE1 arrives at R4.]

484
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:24,491
- We're in first place right now!
- A little bit more, Kim Jong Kook.

485
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:26,620
I had no idea how important it would be to
choose the right order of runners.

486
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,599
Hurry!
That's not the issue right now.

487
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:32,855
You can put her down now.

488
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:34,751
- I will now give you your question.
- I'm so sorry, Jong Kook!

during her rushed apology.]

- I'm really muscly and big boned.
- You have such a great personality.

492

[Though she may be fierce on stage,
she's actually a cute softie in person?]

about energy conservation.

- HanJun's what?
- Customer care center.

497

- What are you doing?

- I can do whatever I want.

- You don't think they took the lead, do you?
- No, they don't have the answer either.

512

[Team 2NE1 is blindly guessing at their answer
to avoid having to go back.]

513

- Hurry up and tell us!

he sprinted off to R5!]

- Baton! He didn't take the baton!
- Gary!

and the crude material is ___.

really tight.

hanging on him like that?

- Please come this way.
- You have to answer the question.

- What were you doing while hanging onto me?

652
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:19,565
[Second round in
the Idol Athletic Competition.]

653
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,143
- What do you think all that is?
- I'm not really sure.

654
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:26,928
[For this round of games,
Eddie Kim will join Team Mystic89.]

655
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:29,557
Everyone needs to put on the costumes
that you all see laid out behind you.

656
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:32,880
[MC Yoo instructs everyone to put on
the potato costumes.]

657
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,806
[The potato costume is hilarious to look at
even without them doing anything in it.]

658
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,292
The men should help the women
with their costumes.

659
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,901
- How am I going to move around in this?
- This is really hard to move around in.

660
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,998
- I've never worn anything like this before.
- This is your first time wearing it?

661
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,788
- She can't fit her head through.
- I can get my head through the opening.

662
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,564
Stop teasing me, Jong Kook.

663
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,500
I will now explain the rules
of your next game to you.

664
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:59,028
It's MC Yoo's Survival Game!

665
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,314
[MC Yoo's Survival Game.]

666
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,322
[What could that be?]

667
00:40:06,086 --> 00:40:09,060
To explain MC Yoo's Survival Game simply

668
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:12,898
I will be the one to decide when and why any
one of you will be disqualified from the game.

669
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:17,295
[MC Yoo is in charge of deciding who will
stay and leave the game.]

670
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:20,526
There are several games that we've
prepared to determine who will stay or leave.

671
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:28,340
If you are not chosen or pass those games,
then those people will be disqualified.

672
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:31,416
The important thing is who will remain
to the end of the game.

673
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,585
The team whose member is the last player
remaining will be the winner of this round.

674
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:36,709
[A special advantage ticket will be given to
the team whose member is the last to remain.]

675
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,593
- I need all of you to yell out, 'Guess it'.
- Okay.

676
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:41,432
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

677
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,961
- Guess it!
- Yes, that's what you need to yell out.

678
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,508
Okay, the first game is...
Guess MC Yoo's taste buds!

679
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:51,023
- Yes, you need to guess my taste buds.
- Ramen.

680
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,306
- I know what he likes.
- You need to guess what I like to eat.

681
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:56,734
If you look over to your side,
there are five different dishes on the table.

682
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:57,958
He likes donkatsu.

683
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:03,208
You need to go and choose a dish
that you think I will like the best.

684
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:08,806
And of those five dishes, I will eat four
that I like, and I won't eat the other dish.

685
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,095
That's pretty cutthroat.

686
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:13,668
The person who brings the dish
that I don't eat will be disqualified.

687
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:17,406
- That's the way this game will be played.
- Why do we have to know what you like?

688
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,342
Just eat it!

689
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,301
- He's so unbelievable.
- Just eat whatever is brought to you.

690
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:26,048
I'm just going to pretend that
I didn't hear what he just said.

691
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,630
[He should be trying to get
on MC Yoo's good side...]

692
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:32,893
[Jong Shin immediately falls into
the butt-kissing mode.]

693
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:35,449
Yes, he's very whiney.
I'm going to tell you this right now.

694
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:38,731
I'm telling all of you this right now.
Don't bring the dish that Kim Jong Kook picks.

695
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:42,767
[All the decisions will be MC Yoo's choice.]

696
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,061
Go!

697
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,384
[Guess MC Yoo's taste buds!
Grab a flag while dressed in the potato suit!]

698
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,861
[Nude potato.]

699
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:05,950
[A fierce battle of the potatoes.]

700
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,486
[To be fair, MC Yoo
can't see who picks which flag.]

701
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,769
[Park Bom still hasn't been able to
pick up her flag.]

702
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,450
[She steals Jun K's flag instead
while he's incapacitated.]

703
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:21,060
- You shouldn't do that, Park Bom.
- There's another one right behind you.

704
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,649
[All their real personalities are
starting to shine.]

705
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:30,893
[Jun K potato is starting to show off
some gag moves while lying on the ground?]

706
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:34,249
Everyone needs to stand in a group with
others who have chosen the same dish.

707
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,173
[All the same dish holding people
must stand together in a group.]

708
00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:44,344
[Ice cream-
Suk Jin, Nichkhun, Junho, Sandara Park.]

709
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,693
[Ramen- Jong Shin, Ha Ha,
Woo Young, Minzy.]

710
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:49,976
[Sweet and sour pork-
Muzy, Eddie Kim, Jun K, Gary.]

711
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:52,339
[Sweet bread-
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, Park Bom, CL.]

712
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,686
[Chicken- Chansung, Jong Kook.]

713
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:57,480
Okay, I will now get started.

714
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:58,928
I'm pretty full at the moment

715
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:02,387
and just like Ji Suk Jin just said,
these are dishes that I normally really like.

716
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:07,101
- Okay, I will now get started.
- I really don't know what he'll choose.

717
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:08,950
That sweet bread looks really good.

718
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:12,694
[Hmm...]

719
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:15,839
I know that he likes fried foods.

720
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,701
[Picking up those chopsticks
must mean...]

721
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:25,355
[Opens the lid to the pot of ramen.]

722
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:32,175
[The ramen group is cheering Jae Suk on.]

723
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,793
Even though I normally already love ramen,
I didn't have any soupy food with my lunch.

724
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:36,031
[It seems as though he's craving
something soupy.]

725
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:38,712
Can't you eat something else first?

726
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:39,742
You chose that real quick.

727
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,377
I know that I could eat this later,
but then the noodles would get soggy.

728
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:44,059
That's right!

729
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,575
[Ramen is chosen.]

730
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:55,022
[Jong Shin, Ha Ha, Woo Young,
and Minzy pass the round.]

731
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,028
I knew that he'd pick ramen.

732
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:58,034
Okay, I ate ramen for my first choice.

733
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,943
[The second dish that his taste buds
are craving is...]

734
00:44:00,944 --> 00:44:02,854
Doesn't your mouth feel a little dry now?

735
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:05,756
I know what kind of foods you like.

736
00:44:05,757 --> 00:44:07,650
Ugh, I don't know what to choose.

737
00:44:07,651 --> 00:44:09,892
- Go for something sweet.
- Yes, satisfy your sweet tooth.

738
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:13,215
Right now... I don't want this to melt.

739
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:17,475
You should be saving that for the end.

740
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,347
[His eyes are locked on the ice cream.]

741
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:22,615
- You should save that for last.
- Just go ahead and eat it.

742
00:44:23,447 --> 00:44:26,396
- Ugh, I just don't know.
- You need to eat real food first.

743
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,184
- I don't know.
- That looks so good.

744
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:30,399
You should save the dessert for last.

745
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:35,405
- You don't know the right way to eat.
- There's an order to how you should eat.

746
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,978
- Just eat what you're craving.
- Take a big bite out of it.

747
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:43,308
[About to take a bite!]

748
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:54,699
[Got happy for nothing...]

749
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,567
Be a man and take a big bite.

750
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,411
[This time... take a big bite.]

751
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:04,733
<i>Stop being such a brat
and just eat it!</i>

752
00:45:05,598 --> 00:45:07,656
<i>Stop being such a brat
and just eat it!</i>

753
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:09,322
Who just said that?

754
00:45:09,323 --> 00:45:14,607
[MC Yoo and the Tiger's never-ending
mind playing games.]

755
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:17,178
Seriously.

756
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,440
Just bite it off.

757
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:21,024
It's in his mouth.

758
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:28,006
[Suk Jin, Nichkhun, Junho, and
Sandara Park passes!]

759
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:29,562
I think you're going to get
a stomachache.

760
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:33,161
[Two out of five dishes are selected.]

761
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:35,978
[Only two more dishes left to go.]

762
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:37,809
I would eat all of this if I wasn't
so full already.

763
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,214
[MC Yoo is heading towards
the chicken.]

764
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,082
- That's going to make you fat.
- What a difference.

765
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,257
You need to eat some more.

766
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:49,928
There's no bad time to eat chicken.

767
00:45:54,802 --> 00:45:56,572
That'll make you fat.

768
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:58,754
[About to take the bite.]

769
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:06,239
[Chicken is selected.]

770
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,897
[Jong Kook and Chansung pass
with their chicken selection.]

771
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,248
I didn't realize that was
Jong Kook's selection.

772
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:18,186
He's been ridiculing everything I do.

773
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,552
He's been ridiculing everything I do.

774
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:27,302
[This is so fun!]

775
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:30,251
[How can this be...]

776
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,124
[That food isn't going to sit well
in his stomach.]

777
00:46:35,646 --> 00:46:38,560
[Bratty Tiger is getting on
MC Yoo's last nerve.]

778
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:40,336
I feel like I'm going to get indigestion.

779
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:42,634
Ugh, I'm going to get indigestion.

780
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,978
[Three out of five dishes are selected.]

781
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:50,290
[Just one more dish left to go.]

782
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:55,313
It's one or the other.
Either the bread or the sweet and sour pork.

783
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:57,399
[Sweet bread vs Sweet and sour pork.]

784
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,117
One of these dishes will not be eaten by me.

785
00:47:03,118 --> 00:47:05,476
Those of you who chose that dish
will unfortunately be disqualified.

786
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:08,293
Make some noise for me.
Who chose the bread?

787
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:15,531
Yoo Jae Suk!
Yoo Jae Suk!

788
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,716
[Giraffe's ineffective cheering.]

789
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,412
Who chose the sweet and sour dish?

790
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:21,456
[Is that a girl screaming?]

791
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:26,376
- The bread?
- Yoo Jae Suk!

792
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,177
[Trying to sweeten him up?]

793
00:47:28,706 --> 00:47:30,417
Sweet and sour pork?

794
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,584
[Please pick the sweet and sour pork!]

795
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:39,210
[MC Yoo's final dish selection.]

796
00:47:39,211 --> 00:47:42,336
[Sweet and sour pork in the right hand,
and sweet break in the left hand.]

797
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:48,499
[MC Yoo's eating performance.]

798
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,891
[Please pick the bread.]

799
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:01,456
[Please pick the sweet and sour pork.]

800
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:06,014
[MC Yoo's explosive eating show.]

801
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:08,249
MC Yoo's decision.

802
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:12,701
Suk Jin's disqualified.

803
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:15,835
[MC Yoo's the one in power...]

804
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,585
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

805
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,484
Okay, I'm going to eat one
of these dishes.

806
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:25,419
[A very tense moment.]

807
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,537
Why do I feel so nervous
over such a trivial thing?

808
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:32,857
[Bread vs Sweet and sour pork.]

809
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:44,733
- So that's what he picked. Really?
- You have to swallow it.

810
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:48,724
[A bite-mark on the bread.]

811
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:54,501
[MC Yoo's final selection is the bread.]

812
00:48:55,853 --> 00:49:00,491
[CL, Kwang Soo, Park Bom, and Ji Hyo pass.]

813
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:02,601
Yoo Jae Suk!

814
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,450
How can you get eliminated right away
during your first game?

815
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,870
[Muzy, Eddie Kim, Jun K, Gary-
Disqualified.]

816
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:15,437
We will now start our second game.
You know which game it'll be, right?

817
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,144
We don't know anything.

818
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,085
Just what is it that we're
supposed to do?

819
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:25,749
- Just leave us alone.
- I'm just an MC doing as I'm told.

820
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,783
And you guys are assistant MC's
to me right now.

821
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:31,406
- We're supposed to be your assistants?
- Yes, you are.

822
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:36,610
Okay, our second game is,
Mr. Can Game!

823
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,505
Mr. Can game will be our second game.

824
00:49:38,506 --> 00:49:40,546
This is a random game of chance.

825
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,330
You will see several flags on the ground
with different numbers on each of them.

826
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,983
Just like with the earlier game,
you will each choose a numbered flag.

827
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,018
[Must select one of the flags on the ground
which are numbered from 1-14.]

828
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:54,836
The person who's holding the number which
pops out of the can will be eliminated.

829
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:57,736
[Starting with number one, the number that
pops out of the can will be eliminated.]

830
00:49:57,737 --> 00:50:00,268
- What does that mean?
- Do you still not understand the game?

831
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,046
No, I still can't understand it.

832
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:05,784
Once everyone has a flag in their hand,
I'm going to play the Mr. Can game up here.

833
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,786
- Then a numbered knife will be inserted...
- Ah, that can game?

834
00:50:08,787 --> 00:50:11,133
- Yes, that's right.
- I thought you meant the other Mr. Can.

835
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,518
No, that's not what we're doing.

836
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,276
[Not the Mr. Can from our distant memories.]

837
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:17,706
[It's the game, Mr. Can.]

838
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:20,338
- No, we're talking about the actual game.
- I get it now.

839
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,956
- I finally get it now.
- Is everyone ready?

840
00:50:22,957 --> 00:50:26,474
- Yes.
- Ready... get, go!

841
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,446
This is just a random game of chance.

842
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,242
[Everyone is carefully choosing their number
with intense focus and concentration.]

843
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:38,118
[Poor Giraffe and his tall height...]

844
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,587
Woo Young, and Bom still need to
pick their flags.

845
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:46,851
[Everyone completes their selection
of the flags.]

846
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,008
Okay, everyone has selected
their own flags.

847
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:53,450
[Mr. Can Pirate takes center stage.]

848
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,964
[They all line up in order from 1-14.]

849
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:59,103
Everyone needs to lift up their flags
so that we can all see your numbers.

850
00:50:59,104 --> 00:51:04,174
- As long as it's not my number, I'm fine.
- I need my assistants to help me out.

851
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:06,152
What's the point of having to put my hand
on his shoulder?

852
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:08,477
- What's the point of doing this?
- It means that we're doing this together.

853
00:51:08,478 --> 00:51:10,565
It means that we're doing this together.

854
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:12,534
It means that we're one as MC's.

855
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:15,436
We're MC'ing this game right now.

856
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:21,076
My arm is starting to hurt!
Just start the game already!

857
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:24,946
I thought it was the other Mr. Can.
I'm so disappointed now.

858
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:29,168
[Assistant MC's shoulder
is starting to hurt him.]

859
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,062
- His shoulder is hurting him.
- Then switch spots with him.

860
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:36,014
[MC army is switching up
their formation.]

861
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:39,214
It means that we're doing this together.
You're not assistant MC's for nothing.

862
00:51:39,942 --> 00:51:44,486
Okay, we're going to do this together.
We'll start with number one.

863
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:47,974
- Number one would be the best.
- That would be so awesome.

864
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:50,273
It would be so awesome if
number one pops out.

865
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:54,072
[Back to being the bratty Tiger.]

866
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,186
You know that I'm very unlucky when it
comes to things like this, right?

867
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:03,656
[Mr. Yoo with his infamous streak of bad luck
when it comes to these games...]

868
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,116
[Bratty Tiger passes the test!]

869
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:11,376
[Too bad.]

870
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:16,375
Please move to the back if you've passed.
Next up is our Sandara!

871
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,737
Number two.
Okay, Sandara.

872
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:30,049
[Sandara Park passes.]

873
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,019
This is really nerve wrecking.

874
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,598
[Such a simple game,
but the nervous level is through the roof.]

875
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,986
I like the reactions from my assistant MC's.

876
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:40,810
[His assistant MC's are starting to find
their roles in the game.]

877
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:43,495
- Okay, number three.
- Why am I getting so nervous?

878
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:46,249
Okay, Chansung.

879
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:52,934
[The knife doesn't seem to be going in?]

880
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,557
No, I got it.

881
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:04,197
[He was only number three,
so how can this be?]

882
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:11,528
- No, number three was right.
- Are you sure that was the right slot?

883
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:14,554
And thus, Chansung is disqualified!

884
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,971
[Chansung of Team 2PM is disqualified.]

885
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,604
[Team Mystic89's Ha Ha also gets
disqualified from this round.]

886
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:26,140
[Final round of MC Yoo's Survival Game.]

887
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:29,292
So the final tally is, there are
still four members of Team 2PM left.

888
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:34,369
Nichkhun, Junho, Woo Young, and Blank Ji
are still left in the game.

889
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,774
And the only team with five members
still left in the game.

890
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:40,552
One person still hasn't been disqualified,
and is still left in the game.

891
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:43,887
[Team 2NE1's members still left in the game-
Jong Kook, CL, Park Bom, Sandara, and Minzy.]

892
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:48,211
- And Team Mystic89, they're already...
- The chance of us losing is getting higher.

893
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,960
- Our team members keeps getting disqualified.
- There are only tree of you left.

894
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:55,286
But you won't know what'll happen
until the game is over.

895
00:53:55,885 --> 00:54:01,102
And for our third and final game,
it's MC Yoo's Challenge!

896
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:03,557
We will now start MC Yoo's Challenge.

897
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,296
Can you bring out the chin up bar?

898
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:08,493
Don't you think that puts us at
too great of a disadvantage?

899
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:12,105
[A giant metal bar is brought out.]

900
00:54:12,275 --> 00:54:15,544
[MC Yoo's final round of game is,
The Chin Pull Up Bar.]

901
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:18,357
- Can someone give us a demonstration?
- Can Chansung please step up?

902
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:20,938
Please watch Chansung and
get a sense of what you'll have to do.

903
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:24,106
- Chansung is good at things like that.
- He's pretty light, so he'll be good.

904
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:27,602
Wow, he's good.

905
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:34,061
[Physical strength befitting of his
beast idol image.]

906
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,736
But the expression on his face
is starting to turn sour.

907
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:41,300
[Beast-like expression is starting to
show through on his face?]

908
00:54:42,834 --> 00:54:44,864
- Chansung did 12.
- Chansung has 12.

909
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,482
Chansung is a very strong person,
with great athletic abilities.

910
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:50,738
[Chansung succeeds in getting 13.]

911
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:54,047
- Why don't we have Eddie give it a try?
- Show us how it's done.

912
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:55,947
Please show us how it's supposed to be done.

913
00:54:55,948 --> 00:54:58,819
One, two, three...

914
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,084
[Light and easy movements.]

915
00:55:03,457 --> 00:55:05,876
You're slowly starting to feel it, aren't you?

916
00:55:05,877 --> 00:55:07,108
He started off nicely.

917
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:08,919
You have to keep going as
long as you can.

918
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,532
[Keep it up for as long as he can to
increase his screen time?]

919
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:14,445
- Thirteen.
- Do one more.

920
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:16,567
- One more, and you'll win.
- That's the only way for you to win.

921
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:19,952
[Eddie Kim succeeds in getting 14.]

922
00:55:19,953 --> 00:55:21,947
- Okay, you will have to decide.
- Do we have to guess the number of pull-ups?

923
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:24,797
I will tell you how many I can do.

924
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:29,507
And you'll have to decide whether I'll be
able to do that many pull-ups or not.

925
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:32,308
[Must decide whether MC Yoo will be able
to do the number of pull-ups or not.]

926
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:35,089
Okay, I say...

927
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:41,396
[What's the number of pull-ups that MC Yoo
will decide on?]

928
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:45,534
18 pull-ups or more.
Yes, or no?

929
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:49,235
[Will he succeed in getting 18 or more
pull-ups or not?]

930
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:53,138
[MC Yoo calls out a pretty high number.]

931
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:56,020
How long has it been since you've
done chin pull-ups?

932
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:59,687
To be honest, it's been over a year
since I've last done any pull-ups.

933
00:55:59,688 --> 00:56:03,558
- How much do you weigh?
- I weigh about 66-67kg.

934
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:04,773
[Second piece of information- Weighs 67kg.]

935
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:07,162
- Can I touch your body real quick?
- My body?

936
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,755
Yes, just lightly.

937
00:56:09,674 --> 00:56:12,120
- Touches and checks his arms.
- Is your arm relaxed?

938
00:56:14,678 --> 00:56:16,773
Don't you think that you're touching me
a little bit too much?

939
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:18,944
I don't think you should be
touching me that much.

940
00:56:20,951 --> 00:56:24,153
[Coach Kkuk is checking out
the metal bar for himself.]

941
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,840
Okay, is everyone ready?

942
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:33,789
[The team with the most number of members
left at the end of this round wins the game.]

943
00:56:37,473 --> 00:56:41,136
[Just like earlier, all three teams seem to
be struggling to make their decision.]

944
00:56:41,137 --> 00:56:43,904
All three games we've played are all so simple
but they've all been so nerve wrecking.

945
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,295
He hasn't done it in a year.

946
00:56:47,296 --> 00:56:51,138
[Will MC Yoo be able to succeed?]

947
00:56:51,906 --> 00:56:53,658
What do we do?

948
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:57,915
[Will Jae Suk be able to do 18?
The result will determine the outcome.]

949
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,547
- Pick the higher possibility.
- Do you think this is a better bet?

950
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:05,497
[Fail- Jong Shin, Park Bom, Sandara Park,
Woo Young, and Nichkhun.]

951
00:57:05,498 --> 00:57:09,926
[Succeed- Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, CL,
Minzy, Ji Hyo and Junho.]

952
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:13,407
Okay, 18 was what I said.

953
00:57:13,408 --> 00:57:18,410
[Nation's beloved 43 year old MC
attempts at getting 18.]

954
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:28,753
[With everyone watching his
every move...]

955
00:57:37,939 --> 00:57:40,627
[Start the challenge.]

956
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,021
[With everyone counting along together...]

957
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:56,970
- He's shaking.
- Please! Come on!

958
00:57:58,112 --> 00:58:00,453
[Both his arms are already
shaking considerably.]

959
00:58:02,014 --> 00:58:03,611
What's wrong with him!

960
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:14,224
[Already succeeds in getting ten.]

961
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:16,846
Please show this nation
what you're capable of!

962
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,036
[Even though he may look like
he's struggling...]

963
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:24,112
[He's still not giving up on his challenge.]

964
00:58:26,026 --> 00:58:29,443
[The onlookers look as though they're the ones
attempting the challenge themselves.]

965
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:35,424
[With every last ounce of his strength...]

966
00:58:38,286 --> 00:58:40,859
[The ones who chose the 'Fail' side
are starting to look anxious...]

967
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:48,208
[A man who doesn't know
how to give up...]

968
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:52,583
[Just three more!]

969
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:55,340
[Everyone is cheering him on as one.]

970
00:58:56,376 --> 00:59:02,023
[Looking quite exhausted.
However...]

971
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:05,498
[With the energy from their cheers,
he does his 16th pull-up.]

972
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,580
[Just two more.]

973
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:21,067
Republic of Korea!

974
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:23,994
Republic of Korea!
Everyone's watching you right now!

975
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:27,123
[Just one more left to go...]

976
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,805
[They're all desperately
cheering him on as one.]

977
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:43,895
[He needs to make just one
more attempt.]

978
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:59,486
[Even though no one will blame him
even if he does end up failing...]

979
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:07,996
[But not even making the attempt
will be the true failure.]

980
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:14,073
[That's why...]

981
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:21,195
[I must try.]

982
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:47,799
[MC Yoo's challenge-
Succeeds in getting 18 pull-ups!]

983
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,958
[A truly admirable attempt
that they can't help but respect.]

984
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:57,851
[Never giving up in a battle
against himself...]

985
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:02,316
He's fierce.

986
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:06,453
[Fierce and admirable determination.]

987
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:10,498
Okay, everyone.
2NE1 wins!

988
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:13,527
[2NE1 wins with three members
still left in the game.]

989
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:21,416
[Team 2NE1 receives a special voucher.]

990
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:26,062
[Arrives at the final location.]

991
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:29,665
Can you hear me?

992
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,309
[Checking the mic in each of the rooms.]

993
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,508
Yes, we hear you.

994
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:36,587
Depressed Mystic Team,
can you hear me?

995
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:38,140
What is he saying?

996
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:42,830
[Seeing their angry reaction,
their mic seems to be working just fine.]

997
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:50,622
Okay everyone.
This is your ultimate final round.

998
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,645
We will now start one on one on one
name tag elimination game.

999
01:01:53,646 --> 01:01:58,326
[1:1:1 name tag elimination.]

1000
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:02,021
<i>Each team will draw a number.</i>

1001
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:06,952
<i>And the 1:1:1 name tag elimination will start
according to the number that you draw.</i>

1002
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:10,562
<i>As soon as a member is eliminated,
the next player will come in immediately.</i>

1003
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:12,727
<i>So the team with the last member still
in the game will win the whole competition.</i>

1004
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:14,702
[The team with the last member still left
in the game will win the whole competition.]

1005
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:17,346
2NE1 members aren't girls.

1006
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:19,950
- Why?
- They're just our chance at a win.

1007
01:02:20,442 --> 01:02:23,255
[This is CEO Yoon's competitive stance.]

1008
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:25,313
We can't go easy on them.
Think of ourselves as a corporation.

1009
01:02:25,757 --> 01:02:28,208
Do you think that Jong Kook will
be concerned about the 2PM guys?

1010
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:29,563
Yes, of course.

1011
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:31,962
Don't you think that it would be wise for us
to team up with 2PM to eliminate Jong Kook?

1012
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,670
- Yes, we should.
- Let's practice our sad face.

1013
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,567
Can you do that?
Let me see.

1014
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:41,665
You totally got it!
Keep that expression on your face.

1015
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:43,092
[All he did was to take off his glasses.]

1016
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:46,080
[I'm sorry for whatever I
may have done...]

1017
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:51,551
<i>You won a special privilege card when you won
the second round of games, right?</i>

1018
01:02:51,552 --> 01:02:52,873
Yes, we did.

1019
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:58,067
<i>You can choose one member from
either one of the other teams</i>

1020
01:02:58,068 --> 01:03:00,486
<i>and you can deprive that person from
participating in the name tag elimination.</i>

1021
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:02,915
[Choose one person form either of the other
teams and prohibit them from participating.]

1022
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:04,713
I think it would be wise to
choose one of the 2PM members.

1023
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,714
- Yes, I agree.
- You're choosing one of the 2PM members?

1024
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,234
<i>I have a bit of a bad news for you.</i>

1025
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:15,390
One of you will not be able to participate
in the name tag elimination game.

1026
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:18,587
[One member from Team 2PM will not be able
to participate in the name tag elimination.]

1027
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:20,808
Team 2NE1 chose your team.

1028
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:25,199
[The person who draws the 'x' ball will not
be able to participate in the game.]

1029
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:28,535
[Blank Ji is chosen.]

1030
01:03:28,536 --> 01:03:30,389
No, that's bad!

1031
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,319
- You're the best out of all of us.
- But are you really a 2PM member?

1032
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,000
But I'm a member of Team 2PM.

1033
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:38,923
Then I'll keep an eye on everything
and coach you guys through.

1034
01:03:38,924 --> 01:03:40,247
We should be okay then.

1035
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:48,805
<i>2014... Idol Athletic Competition.</i>

1036
01:03:48,806 --> 01:03:53,435
We will now start our 1:1:1
name tag elimination game.

1037
01:03:53,436 --> 01:03:58,269
Everyone... as you may all already know,
there's no such thing as mercy in this game.

1038
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:01,101
You will have to eliminate your opponents as
quickly as possible for you to survive.

1039
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:03,949
<i>You will have to eliminate your opponents as
quickly as possible for you to survive.</i>

1040
01:04:05,527 --> 01:04:10,711
<i>Team 2NE1, Team Mystic89,
and Team 2PM.</i>

1041
01:04:10,712 --> 01:04:14,825
The first player from each team
must now enter the game arena.

1042
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:21,020
[Time for the first player
to make their entrance.]

1043
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,901
The game will start as soon as
you come into the arena.

1044
01:04:24,936 --> 01:04:27,670
You have to rip off the name tag
from your opponents' backs.

1045
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:29,963
<i>It's the name tag elimination game.</i>

1046
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:33,266
[First player for Team 2PM- Woo Young.]

1047
01:04:34,573 --> 01:04:37,802
[First player for Team Mystic89- Muzy.]

1048
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:43,309
[First player for Team 2NE1- Sandara Park.]

1049
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:51,586
[The battle begins now.]

1050
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,820
There's only one rule.
Eliminate your opponent's name tag.

1051
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:05,588
Team 2NE1 with the most number of players,
with six members still left in the game.

1052
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:08,202
And here comes one of our first players.

1053
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:13,584
Here comes our players.
We've never broadcasted it live like this.

1054
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:17,297
- Muzy has made his entrance.
- Why are you telling the others that?

1055
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:19,376
I have to since I'm MC'ing this event.

1056
01:05:19,377 --> 01:05:22,865
Okay, Muzy is on the second floor
right now.

1057
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,632
<i>Okay, Muzy is on
the second floor right now.</i>

1058
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:28,486
[Teams in their own rooms can listen
to the live broadcast of the game.]

1059
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:30,639
He's broadcasting the whole game?

1060
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,539
[For the first time ever-
MC Yoo broadcasts the name tag elimination.]

1061
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:40,316
This is a live broadcast of the game.
I hope everyone enjoys the game.

1062
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:42,751
Even though I may not have looked like I was
doing anything today

1063
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,089
I've been busier than anyone else.

1064
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,134
I hope everyone recognizes that.

1065
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:50,870
[Walking around to keep broadcasting
the show live to all the listeners.]

1066
01:05:50,871 --> 01:05:52,948
Seeing that I haven't heard anyone
screaming out loud yet...

1067
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,294
It seems as though Muzy has gone down
to the first floor.

1068
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:57,742
<i>It seems as though Muzy has gone down
to the first floor.</i>

1069
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:02,307
I can hear his cackling laughter,
and here he comes right now.

1070
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:04,631
Muzy is passing by me right now.

1071
01:06:06,065 --> 01:06:09,345
Since this is a live broadcast,
he's now going to the third floor...

1072
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:11,219
No, he's going back down to
the second floor.

1073
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,177
- Okay, Muzy.
- Why are you telling everyone else all that?

1074
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:18,556
- Why are you only talking about our team?
- What's wrong with him?

1075
01:06:18,977 --> 01:06:21,998
What kind of a live broadcast is this?

1076
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:25,612
- He's only talking about Muzy.
- Not much has happened so far.

1077
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:28,867
I think a couple of our players have just
run into each other on the first floor.

1078
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,197
I think there's some action on the 1st floor,
and I'm going to go check right now.

1079
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,782
[MC Yoo runs down to where
all the action is.]

1080
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,836
It's getting to that time where we should
be getting our first elimination.

1081
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,262
Ah, I can hear something down here.

1082
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,835
There they are.
It's Woo Young!

1083
01:06:43,836 --> 01:06:46,168
[Muzy of Team Mystic,
and Woo Young of Team 2PM.]

1084
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,455
<i>It's 2PM's Woo Young!</i>

1085
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:52,206
[Total concentration.]

1086
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:55,508
We still don't know who the first player is
from Team 2NE1.

1087
01:06:56,344 --> 01:07:00,353
Seeing how we still don't know who the
first player from Team 2NE1 is yet...

1088
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:03,221
there's a high chance that it's
one of the female members.

1089
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:05,666
<i>There's a high chance that it's
one of the female members.</i>

1090
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,620
[Sandara's immediate plan is
to stay in hiding for now.]

1091
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:13,077
Why don't we shake hands
before we get started?

1092
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:16,011
There's no time for that.
You must get started right away.

1093
01:07:17,071 --> 01:07:20,383
- I just want to shake your hand.
- Muzy's not to be taken lightly either.

1094
01:07:20,731 --> 01:07:23,547
[After offering a handshake in peace,
Muzy immediately launches into an attack.]

1095
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:28,992
[Listening intently to the live broadcast.]

1096
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:37,315
[In extreme danger!
Muzy's name tag is in Woo Young's hand!]

1097
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:41,492
I don't know what's going to happen!

1098
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,565
[MC Yoo's highly excited voice is
conveying the level of anxiousness.]

1099
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:48,404
<i>I don't know what's going to happen!</i>

1100
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:50,299
I don't know what's going to happen!

1101
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:02,711
[Woo Young- Out!]

1102
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,011
Woo Young is out!

1103
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:07,760
Woo Young is ousted!
Woo Young is out!

1104
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:15,532
[A reaction similar to that
of a World cup win.]

1105
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:19,825
Woo Young is ousted!

1106
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:23,633
[A totally unexpected win by Muzy!]

1107
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:27,977
Muzy!
Muzy!

1108
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,936
Wow, Muzy!
That was totally unexpected!

1109
01:08:30,937 --> 01:08:33,089
How do you feel right now,
Woo Young?

1110
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:37,718
You must be extremely flustered right now.
I started it off so nicely too!

1111
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:39,250
How do you feel right now?

1112
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:43,849
- I just feel really, really...
- Really, really, right?

1113
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,706
I'm sure you must be quite
flustered at the moment.

1114
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:47,830
How can this be?

1115
01:08:47,831 --> 01:08:51,399
[Team 2PM's first player-
Woo Young is out!]

1116
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:54,940
<i>Okay, 2PM's second player will now come out.
Second player to make his entrance.</i>

1117
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:01,578
I got it now.
I got the feel for it now.

1118
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,484
I got the feel for it now.

1119
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:05,986
I still have one more chance.

1120
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,682
[Woo Young still has one more chance?]

1121
01:09:10,683 --> 01:09:12,119
<i>- Remember the certificate that you received?
- Yes.</i>

1122
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:17,420
[Team 2PM earned a certificate when
they won the City Marathon game.]

1123
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:19,771
That ticket will give one of the members
an extra life in the game.

1124
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,656
[One member of the team will have two chances
to play in the game.]

1125
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:25,896
[A lottery to pick who will get two lives
to play in the game.]

1126
01:09:26,303 --> 01:09:27,795
Oh no, what do I do?

1127
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:32,341
[Woo Young is chosen.]

1128
01:09:35,227 --> 01:09:37,971
Ugh... it should've been Nichkhun.

1129
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:41,131
Put your faith in me, Ji Hyo.

1130
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:46,753
[I will pay this humiliation back tenfold.]

1131
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:49,841
Woo Young was so very close.

1132
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:54,872
[Off on his way to find
the next hot action spot.]

1133
01:09:55,339 --> 01:09:57,712
I have a feeling that Team Mystic89 is in
an extremely good mood right about now.

1134
01:10:00,183 --> 01:10:01,574
Ah, number two!

1135
01:10:01,575 --> 01:10:03,954
It's 2PM's Chansung.

1136
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:06,038
- Yes, it's Chansung.
- Chansung is our second player.

1137
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,104
Chansung's good.

1138
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,705
You have to work together, Muzy.
Use your brain.

1139
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:16,396
[Work together with the other team, Muzy.]

1140
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:20,618
Okay, where could the 2NE1 player be?

1141
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:24,120
2NE1 could really win if they keep up
this battle tactic.

1142
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:26,511
I'm positive that the 2NE1 player
must be hiding out somewhere.

1143
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:30,264
Yes, this is 2NE1's room.

1144
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:33,737
Okay, so the first player...

1145
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:36,591
So Sandara is the first player?

1146
01:10:36,592 --> 01:10:38,924
- Please don't say that.
- Be quiet.

1147
01:10:38,925 --> 01:10:41,241
[Once MC Yoo knows something,
then the rest of the world will also know.]

1148
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:45,854
[Excited to hear that their opponent
is quite the easy prey.]

1149
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:48,025
This is what live broadcasting is all about.

1150
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:52,014
[Constantly moving live broadcast.]

1151
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:55,383
Muzy is heading back down to the first floor.

1152
01:10:55,763 --> 01:10:57,710
He's pondering whether he should or not.
I think someone is heading up here.

1153
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,687
I think someone is headed up
here right now.

1154
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,158
[Chansung and Sandara.]

1155
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,443
[And is that Sandara's name tag?]

1156
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:09,107
[Just five minutes ago.]

1157
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,979
<i>Let's work together
and eliminate the other player.</i>

1158
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:19,993
[Team 2NE1's first player,
Sandara is out!]

1159
01:11:19,994 --> 01:11:23,311
Chansung has ousted Sandara Park.

1160
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,403
<i>Chansung has ousted Sandara Park.</i>

1161
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:35,029
Unfortunately, Sandara must now go up
to the eliminated player holding cell.

1162
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:39,717
It's now time for Team 2NE1's
second player to come out.

1163
01:11:39,718 --> 01:11:44,866
[Team 2NE1's second player- Gary.]

1164
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,102
You have to stick it out in there.
Last as long as you can.

1165
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:52,343
With the exception of Team Mystic,
the other teams are now on their 2nd players.

1166
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,764
<i>No, I'm not going to do that.</i>

1167
01:11:57,088 --> 01:11:58,721
It sounds as though there's something
going on up on the third floor.

1168
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:00,184
Shall we go up and see what's
going on?

1169
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,774
Let's check and see what's going on.

1170
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:06,211
Gary.

1171
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:10,041
- Gary is the second player.
- It's Gary.

1172
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:12,247
It would be nice if Gary and Chansung
went at it against each other.

1173
01:12:13,887 --> 01:12:18,084
[All three players are now facing off
against each other on the third floor.]

1174
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:22,111
Something tells me that these players
have agreed to work together.

1175
01:12:22,511 --> 01:12:25,457
Why are you two working together
and leaving me out in the cold?

1176
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:28,076
They're right outside.

1177
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:32,779
Fighting, Chansung!

1178
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:36,660
Look at how relaxed they look.
None of our team members are smiling.

1179
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:39,291
They look like a crazed group of lions
who are just dying to come out here.

1180
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:42,358
Work together with them if you don't think
you can take them on, Chansung.

1181
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:47,468
- There's Muzy...
- Why are you two closing in on me?

1182
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:49,548
I have no other choice.
I already agreed that I would.

1183
01:12:49,549 --> 01:12:52,154
You have to be understanding, Chansung.
Your team has too many guys.

1184
01:12:52,155 --> 01:12:58,472
- Even though his team are also all guys...
- Mystic89 is still on their first player.

1185
01:12:58,909 --> 01:13:01,782
[His mouth never seems to take a break.]

1186
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:04,995
There's no mercy when it comes to
the name tag elimination game.

1187
01:13:04,996 --> 01:13:09,456
Since I feel that this fight may get
a little rough...

1188
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,085
Can you please keep it down?
You're making me feel even more nervous!

1189
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:15,474
- Why do you keep doing that?
- It's because this is a live broadcast.

1190
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:18,069
[What a bratty little MC.]

1191
01:13:18,585 --> 01:13:21,253
Chansung is slowly starting to
get backed into a corner.

1192
01:13:21,254 --> 01:13:23,843
Chansung is now being cornered.

1193
01:13:23,844 --> 01:13:25,807
[Gary and Muzy vs Chansung.]

1194
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:28,935
Chansung must somehow get himself out.
Muzy is attempting to grab his right hand.

1195
01:13:30,857 --> 01:13:33,214
But Chansung's strength
is nothing to scoff at.

1196
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,806
[Chansung's fierce defensive moves.]

1197
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:41,789
Gary!

1198
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,496
[As the battle escalates,
so does Jae Suk's voice.]

1199
01:13:45,999 --> 01:13:47,933
Muzy is now...

1200
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:49,690
Chansung is way too strong!

1201
01:13:51,312 --> 01:13:53,650
Seriously!
He's like tuna fish!

1202
01:13:54,868 --> 01:13:58,264
[Strong Chansung Tuna.]

1203
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:02,042
It's now or never!

1204
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:04,980
Will it be Muzy or Gary?

1205
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:09,408
[Muzy escapes another close call.]

1206
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,375
[And Chansung is ousted.]

1207
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,054
<i>Muzy's name tag is in his hands...
Oh, Chansung is ousted!</i>

1208
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,999
- Muzy's good.
- He's really good.

1209
01:14:29,602 --> 01:14:31,251
<i>Chansung is out.</i>

1210
01:14:32,086 --> 01:14:34,168
<i>Who will be 2PM's third player?</i>

1211
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,824
Amazingly enough,
Muzy is still left in the game.

1212
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,282
He's a perfect member of our team.

1213
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:48,001
You gave it your best shot, Chansung.

1214
01:14:48,002 --> 01:14:50,596
But it was nearly impossible to handle
those two by yourself.

1215
01:14:50,597 --> 01:14:53,341
It's not easy to be ganged up on, is it?

1216
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:56,801
Two members of your team have now been
ousted by Muzy's sly moves.

1217
01:14:56,802 --> 01:15:02,812
Whatever the case, Chansung is now ousted.
How disappointing for Chansung!

1218
01:15:10,249 --> 01:15:14,950
[Junho also gets ousted by
Gary and Muzy.]

1219
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:18,846
Gary and Muzy... I think it's about time
for those two to face off with one another.

1220
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,270
Yes, I think the time has come for them
to battle one another.

1221
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:27,009
If you keep this up...
Gary must make a cautious decision.

1222
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:30,223
If Gary keeps working with Muzy,
and makes any mistakes...

1223
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,273
then you might get betrayed and
get ousted by Muzy in the end.

1224
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:35,771
Gary is the one who usually gets
betrayed in situations like this one.

1225
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:39,833
- Do you know the idiom, Tosa-gu-pang?
- No, I've forgotten what that means.

1226
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:44,819
It means that once a dog wears out
his usefulness to his master...

1227
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,700
- Then I'll get abandoned?
- Yes, that's correct.

1228
01:15:46,701 --> 01:15:49,062
Come on, why would you say
something like that?

1229
01:15:49,063 --> 01:15:52,137
- Since we don't really know Muzy very well...
- Yes, you're right.

1230
01:15:52,138 --> 01:15:53,786
It's been fun.

1231
01:15:53,787 --> 01:15:55,415
There's nothing we can do about this.

1232
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:58,137
[Finally... It's Gary vs Muzy.]

1233
01:15:58,138 --> 01:16:03,490
They just shook hands even though they didn't
really mean it, and they're now going to

1234
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,059
start battling each other.

1235
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,145
Gary's speed and strength are
quite impressive.

1236
01:16:09,146 --> 01:16:11,140
[Muzy's ferocious attack.]

1237
01:16:12,837 --> 01:16:15,522
Did he get your name tag?
Gary!

1238
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,745
[Can Muzy really oust Gary?]

1239
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:21,614
Gary!
His name tag is in danger!

1240
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:25,221
[Gary is in an extreme state of danger!]

1241
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:27,937
No!

1242
01:16:29,858 --> 01:16:32,573
Gary!

1243
01:16:32,574 --> 01:16:35,901
Gary!
Gary's in big trouble right now.

1244
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,535
[By the split of a hair,
Muzy gets ousted first!]

1245
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:50,677
[That's our Random Mr. Capable, Gary!]

1246
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:52,977
<i>Muzy is ousted!</i>

1247
01:16:52,978 --> 01:16:55,730
<i>Muzy is ousted!
That's our Gary!</i>

1248
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:58,599
CEO Yoon went to the bathroom again.

1249
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:02,307
[Of all times, this is
when he has to go to the bathroom?]

1250
01:17:02,308 --> 01:17:04,195
<i>Muzy is finally ousted!</i>

1251
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:07,023
[Team Mystic89's first player,
Muzy, is finally ousted!]

1252
01:17:07,024 --> 01:17:10,181
Can you edit out the shot of my stomach?
I was so concerned my stomach would show!

1253
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:12,701
I'm seriously begging you.
Edit out that shot of my stomach.

1254
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:17,951
[Yes, we'll do it for you.]

1255
01:17:17,952 --> 01:17:20,398
His stomach was shown on screen.

1256
01:17:20,829 --> 01:17:24,096
Muzy lasted for quite a while.

1257
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:28,176
Team Mystic89's Muzy
has finally been ousted.

1258
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:30,190
Even though your team still has a lot of
players left

1259
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:32,155
but that still doesn't give you
a very good chance of winning.

1260
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:36,066
I may not know about anything else,
but if our CEO Yoon is about to come out...

1261
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:38,834
then I really pray that he won't come across
as looking sad or pathetic.

1262
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:42,078
Muzy definitely pulled your weight
by doing the best you could for your team.

1263
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:43,623
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Muzy.

1264
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:46,071
It's now time for Team Mystic89's
second player to come out.

1265
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:47,761
There he is.
Nichkhun is finally here.

1266
01:17:47,762 --> 01:17:49,163
What the heck!

1267
01:17:50,442 --> 01:17:52,361
Can't we talk a little bit first?

1268
01:17:52,362 --> 01:17:54,125
[Show no mercy!
Immediately launches into attack mode.]

1269
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:56,607
Gary is in big trouble now.
Nichkhun is in full attack mode.

1270
01:17:56,608 --> 01:18:01,331
Nichkhun already came out before
Muzy could even get out of here.

1271
01:18:02,713 --> 01:18:05,580
[Gary vs Nichkhun.]

1272
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,616
Gary is once again showing us his stomach.
We can now see Gary's stomach again.

1273
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:17,644
[Mr. Gary is so relatable.]

1274
01:18:19,014 --> 01:18:21,053
Nichkhun has very long arms.

1275
01:18:21,054 --> 01:18:24,151
But Gary's strength
is nothing to discount either.

1276
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:25,942
Even though Nichkhun is strong himself...

1277
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:29,235
If the next member of Team Mystic was to
come out now and join forces...

1278
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:33,393
Actually, I can see Yoon Jong Shin
carefully making his approach right now.

1279
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:35,276
[Just then, CEO Yoon makes his appearance.]

1280
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:39,620
[Fails at an ambush attack on Nichkhun.]

1281
01:18:39,621 --> 01:18:44,025
<i>He's eyeing Nichkhun's back.</i>

1282
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:46,565
[We told him not to do anything hasty...]

1283
01:18:46,566 --> 01:18:50,644
We can't forget that there's still Jong Kook
that we have to consider.

1284
01:18:50,645 --> 01:18:53,070
He's trying to talk this out.

1285
01:18:53,071 --> 01:18:57,345
Are you going to help me, Jong Shin?
If we oust that other team first...

1286
01:18:57,346 --> 01:19:00,202
Seeing how his stomach seems to have
more mass than his arms...

1287
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:02,547
[His stomach looks more distended than
when he used to be on Family Outing.]

1288
01:19:03,045 --> 01:19:05,369
I'm going to join forces with Nichkhun.

1289
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,155
[CEO Yoon and Nichkhun agree
to work together.]

1290
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:11,075
Yoon Jong Shin and Nichkhun
have now allied.

1291
01:19:11,076 --> 01:19:13,823
Gary is currently backed up
against the wall.

1292
01:19:13,824 --> 01:19:16,973
If those two gang up on Gary together,
that will make things very tough for Gary.

1293
01:19:17,932 --> 01:19:23,189
Gary... Yoon Jong Shin has his left arm,
and Nichkhun has his right arm.

1294
01:19:25,202 --> 01:19:27,609
[Gary's surprise counterattack.]

1295
01:19:28,122 --> 01:19:30,408
But Nichkhun has very long arms.

1296
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:36,470
[Gary escapes from imminent danger.]

1297
01:19:38,486 --> 01:19:39,748
Gary.

1298
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,074
You're really strong.

1299
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:46,086
[Is CEO Yoon trying to swap his
alliances with Gary this time?]

1300
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:53,325
[Even his own team members are
speechless at the absurdity of his actions.]

1301
01:19:54,395 --> 01:19:56,689
Wow... seriously.

1302
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,808
No, but we still need to get Jong Kook.
Sorry, Gary.

1303
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:02,762
The two are back to attacking Gary together.

1304
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:04,336
[CEO Yoon and Nichkhun resume
their alliances.]

1305
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:07,972
Gary is backed up against the wall.

1306
01:20:07,973 --> 01:20:10,166
The hand is on his back!

1307
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:14,288
[Gary is back in danger!]

1308
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:18,651
Yoon Jong Shin is... look at him.

1309
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:23,462
- Okay, I got it.
- I don't know what he thinks he got.

1310
01:20:23,463 --> 01:20:26,504
I don't know what he thinks
he's got right now.

1311
01:20:34,482 --> 01:20:38,253
[Yoon Jong Shin- Out!]

1312
01:20:39,737 --> 01:20:42,036
Yoon Jong Shin is out.

1313
01:20:44,348 --> 01:20:45,882
<i>Yoon Jong Shin is out.</i>

1314
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:55,950
Yoon Jong Shin.

1315
01:20:55,951 --> 01:21:01,906
Just as everyone had predicted,
in all history of Running Man...

1316
01:21:01,907 --> 01:21:04,468
he was most pathetically...

1317
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:07,229
He was most pathetically ousted.

1318
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:11,903
The most pathetically ousted in
all history of Running Man.

1319
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:15,738
I don't know what happened but
one arm just pulled me down.

1320
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:17,918
I thought you were battling an anaconda.

1321
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:20,280
- It was like you were battling an anaconda.
- Gary is amazing.

1322
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:23,850
This darned Running Man show!

1323
01:21:25,016 --> 01:21:27,415
He's heading back down after showing us
one very pathetic sideshow.

1324
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:30,510
One very pathetic show.
Swapping alliances here and there.

1325
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:34,970
It's time for the next player of
Team Mystic89 to come out.

1326
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:38,454
[Next player- Kwang Soo.]

1327
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:44,186
[Even though he's normally a weak player,
he's a strong force amongst these members.]

1328
01:21:46,908 --> 01:21:48,545
[Huh?]

1329
01:21:48,546 --> 01:21:50,693
The third player is Lee Kwang Soo.

1330
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,766
[Give me that mic!]

1331
01:21:56,485 --> 01:21:58,893
[Nichkhun rushes over immediately
after having heard the announcement.]

1332
01:21:59,203 --> 01:22:02,106
What are you going to do?
Are you going to attack me?

1333
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:04,982
[Nichkhun vs Gary vs Kwang Soo.]

1334
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:08,502
You need to think about this carefully, Khun.
We still have Jong Kook left to battle.

1335
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:13,315
- Once I'm ousted, there's Jung Chi...
- You're talking like Jong Shin.

1336
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:16,395
There's still Jung Chi, Dong Hoon, and
Suk Jin left.

1337
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:18,318
Do you think you could eliminate
Jong Kook with them?

1338
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:20,232
Let's say that you could
eliminate Jong Kook.

1339
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:22,960
- Then can you eliminate him?
- Why wouldn't you be able to?

1340
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:24,938
Are you going to eliminate
Kim Jong Kook or me?

1341
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:26,966
Who do you think will be easier?
You have to be smart about this!

1342
01:22:27,922 --> 01:22:28,991
As long as we can oust Jong Kook together,
I don't care if I get ousted.

1343
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,508
I like that idea too.

1344
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,369
- Okay, fine.
- Who does Kim Jong Kook think he is?

1345
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,331
I never said that.

1346
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,196
<i>Who does Kim Jong Kook think he is?</i>

1347
01:22:41,197 --> 01:22:43,738
[Unbelievable...]

1348
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,380
You can attack me if Jong Kook wasn't around,
but we still have Jong Kook left in the game.

1349
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:50,899
Lee Kwang Soo has long arms,
and he's quite strong as well.

1350
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,679
Trust me.

1351
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:56,942
[Kwang Soo and Nichkhun ultimately
decides to join alliances in the end.]

1352
01:22:56,943 --> 01:22:59,874
- You're going to get betrayed.
- Nichkhun is slowly making his move.

1353
01:23:00,484 --> 01:23:03,009
Lee Kwang Soo and Nichkhun
are joining their alliances.

1354
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:05,769
<i>Lee Kwang Soo and Nichkhun
are joining their alliances.</i>

1355
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:08,352
[How can this be?]

1356
01:23:08,353 --> 01:23:12,595
- No, that's not even right!
- He fell for it.

1357
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:15,776
<i>Lee Kwang Soo and Nichkhun
are joining their alliances.</i>

1358
01:23:16,689 --> 01:23:19,137
I'll stand in front of you.

1359
01:23:19,138 --> 01:23:23,030
They have joined their alliances,
and Gary is being cornered right now.

1360
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,197
[Gary vs Kwang Soo and Nichkhun.]

1361
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:29,661
This is very different from when Jong Shin
and Nichkhun were attacking him earlier.

1362
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:33,507
Lee Kwang Soo now has Gary locked
in his tight viselike grip.

1363
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:38,828
[Is that Nichkhun's hand on
Kwang Soo's back?]

1364
01:23:38,829 --> 01:23:41,100
[Nichkhun ambushes Kwang Soo!]

1365
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:47,128
[Kwang Soo- Out!]

1366
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:49,099
Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo!

1367
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,550
Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo!

1368
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,895
- Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo!
- Wow, Nichkhun...

1369
01:23:59,014 --> 01:24:00,827
Nichkhun betrayed Kwang Soo.

1370
01:24:01,614 --> 01:24:03,833
Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo!

1371
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:06,443
Nichkhun is the best!

1372
01:24:07,678 --> 01:24:10,234
<i>Even if Kwang Soo offers his alliance,
don't ever trust him.</i>

1373
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:12,846
<i>If he offers he alliance, agree to it,
then eliminate him right away.</i>

1374
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:16,009
[Their pre-race meeting.]

1375
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,542
[Okay... went just as they had planned.]

1376
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:24,688
[Betrayer Giraffe is betrayed by
his own deceitful plan.]

1377
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:27,715
Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo!

1378
01:24:27,716 --> 01:24:31,530
Team Mystic89's ace just
came down crumbling.

1379
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:35,970
Team Mystic89 is in an utter state
of bewilderment right now.

1380
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:39,905
- How can Nichkhun do that?
- Nichkhun betrays Kwang Soo.

1381
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:43,875
- We have to oust the 2NE1 Team.
- Nichkhun just betrayed Kwang Soo.

1382
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:46,425
[His fierce streak of competitiveness
behind the sweet and innocent face.]

1383
01:24:47,779 --> 01:24:51,918
[Okay, who's next?]

1384
01:24:57,343 --> 01:25:01,522
Okay, I'm searching around to see
where Gary could be hiding.

1385
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,097
But I still haven't been able
to find him.

1386
01:25:06,904 --> 01:25:08,893
Something is happening on
the second floor.

1387
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:12,157
I'm headed down right now to see
what's going on down there.

1388
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:17,244
At last, Gary is besieged on the ground.

1389
01:25:17,748 --> 01:25:20,328
[There they all are.]

1390
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:23,835
Ha Ha and Nichkhun are attacking Gary
together, but Gary isn't going down easily.

1391
01:25:23,836 --> 01:25:27,100
Nichkhun has Gary's left arm, and
Ha Ha is even using his legs to subdue him.

1392
01:25:28,146 --> 01:25:31,284
[Breaking out the arm bar move.]

1393
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:35,162
He's breaking out the arm bar move!

1394
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:39,402
I never realized that you needed moves
like that in the name tag elimination.

1395
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:46,070
[Ha Ha locks him down with the arm bar move,
and Nichkhun takes care of the rest.]

1396
01:25:46,071 --> 01:25:47,740
Gary is ousted!

1397
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:50,777
Gary is ousted.

1398
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:53,603
[Gary ultimately gets ousted from
being ganged up on by the other two teams.]

1399
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:58,302
[What cowards...]

1400
01:26:02,837 --> 01:26:06,794
I keep getting glances of this outfit,
and I really do not like it.

1401
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,695
I can't believe that I've been
wearing this shirt all day.

1402
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:13,269
I can't help but think that wearing this
outfit has been my real challenge.

1403
01:26:13,913 --> 01:26:16,983
We are now climbing up to
the third floor.

1404
01:26:17,701 --> 01:26:20,607
The next 2NE1 member that comes out
could be at a great disadvantage.

1405
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,075
Oh my, look who it is.
It's Minzy.

1406
01:26:28,076 --> 01:26:29,910
But you have to remember that
Minzy is not your average girl.

1407
01:26:29,911 --> 01:26:34,755
- Minzy.
- Minzy is quite strong herself.

1408
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,436
[It's not good to run into them
so quickly like that...]

1409
01:26:39,348 --> 01:26:42,347
- Ha Ha right now is...
- She's so strong!

1410
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,352
- Nichkhun is...
- Come help me, Nichkhun!

1411
01:26:46,353 --> 01:26:47,824
Ha Ha, can you not handle her
by yourself?

1412
01:26:47,825 --> 01:26:50,981
I'm sure that you can see for yourself that
he can't, and that's why he's asking for help.

1413
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,141
No!

1414
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:56,890
[I can't believe they're ganging up
on a girl like that...]

1415
01:27:01,392 --> 01:27:04,184
[Gong Minzy- Out!]

1416
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,666
- How disappointing for Minzy.
- Seriously.

1417
01:27:07,386 --> 01:27:09,676
[I can't take this anymore.]

1418
01:27:11,745 --> 01:27:15,360
<i>Minzy had to have the strength of
two men to oust her out of the game.</i>

1419
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:18,746
[Fueled by desire for revenge.]

1420
01:27:21,741 --> 01:27:24,104
How could they have done that to a girl?
I'll be back.

1421
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:26,750
- Fighting!
- See you later.

1422
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:31,132
[You just all wait.]

1423
01:27:31,133 --> 01:27:34,356
[Because I'm on my way.]

1424
01:27:37,775 --> 01:27:41,251
There's a very tense air in the atmosphere
at the moment.

1425
01:27:44,656 --> 01:27:46,517
It's Jong Kook.

1426
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,868
<i>Kim Jong Kook has finally
made his way out.</i>

1427
01:27:53,804 --> 01:27:56,053
<i>Kim Jong Kook has finally
made his way out.</i>

1428
01:27:56,393 --> 01:27:59,170
[Even the announcement is enough
to give them a scare.]

1429
01:28:00,543 --> 01:28:07,120
[Who will face off
against this ferocious Tiger?]

1430
01:28:07,121 --> 01:28:08,652
It's war now.

1431
01:28:08,653 --> 01:28:10,750
Let's go.
Let's go right now.

1432
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:15,623
After having listened to the live broadcast
of what just happened to Minzy

1433
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,702
it's possible that Kim Jong Kook is more
fired up than he normally is.

1434
01:28:17,703 --> 01:28:24,373
[I have to find a good spot.
I need to surprise them with my attack.]

1435
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:29,239
Come on in.

1436
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,321
- He sounds so scary.
- He wants us to come in.

1437
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:35,222
- Come on in.
- Kim Jong Kook is standing in the darkness.

1438
01:28:38,676 --> 01:28:41,354
- He's standing alone in the darkness.
- He's angry at us right now.

1439
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,240
[The Tiger's rage could be seen
in the fiery glint in his eyes.]

1440
01:28:47,844 --> 01:28:50,656
Even from this far away distance,
I can see the anger simmering off of him.

1441
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:55,607
This battle with Kim Jong Kook will be
the true highlight of today's competition.

1442
01:28:57,635 --> 01:29:00,666
[Jong Kook vs Ha Ha and Nichkhun.]

1443
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:03,552
If Kim Jong Kook is defeated now,
that will make things very tough for 2NE1.

1444
01:29:10,455 --> 01:29:12,617
[Ha Ha is ousted in a blink of an eye.]

1445
01:29:13,113 --> 01:29:15,000
