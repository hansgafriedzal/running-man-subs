172

She made a cameo appearance as
Jung Joon Ha's fake sister-in-law.

173
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,490
- Seriously?
- Yes.

174
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:27,954

She made an appearance as
the fake sister-in-law.

177
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,993
Next up, we have Mr. Park Seo Joon.

178
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,196
[A hot up and coming actor,
Park Seo Joon.]

179
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,729
You became a star
because of Running Man, right?

180
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,208
Yes, another actor that Running Man
has helped launch their career.

181
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,147
I have no doubt that he will become
a huge star in the future.

182
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:58,702
[Frigid negative temperatures
that will forever remain in his memory.]

183
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:02,053

185
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:07,830
- Yes, he always tries very hard.
- You're teamed up with Ji Hyo today.

186
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:08,963
How do you feel about that?

187
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:13,649
When I met her earlier today...
she was nodding off on the steps.

188
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,986
[Eating while sleeping-
A serious multi-tasker.]

189
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,918
Ji Hyo can fall asleep
pretty much anywhere.

190
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,883
She falls asleep in places that I never
thought were possible for humans.

191
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,042
She even fell asleep ten meters
off the ground.

192
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:31,792
- Next is Narsha!
- Narsha!

193
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:35,524
[A lovely mature idol, Narsha.]

194
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:39,845
- You have a unique helmet style haircut.
- She was imitating my haircut.

195
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:43,683
Yes, I got a haircut when I found out
that I was going to be on Running Man.

196
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:47,109
It's very pretty.
Look at the back.

197
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,754
I don't know what it is about Narsha,
but I always find her so attractive.

198
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:57,020
- Narsha is partnered with Kwang Soo today.
- Yes.

199
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,851
We will wait and see what you two
will have in store for us.

200
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:02,804
This is a couple race for all seven couples.

201

202

[It's a race that will test the
sturdiness of their love.]

203
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:12,677
We will be giving you a rock which you will
need for seven different courses.

204
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:13,926
Okay.

205
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:16,244
The rocks will vary from a very strong rock
which is practically indestructible

206
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:22,144
all the way down to a very weak rock which
could crumble from the slightest provocation.

207
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:25,339
[A total of seven different types of rocks.]

208
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:34,157
[The sturdiness of these rocks will prove
which of the seven loves are the strongest.]

209
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,178
- There's an egg.
- It's an egg.

210
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,779
- Look, that's an egg.
- That one looks like a rice cake.

211
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,117
After winning each of the missions

212
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:48,680
you will get the chance to see,
and swap out your rock with someone else's.

213
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,736
These two people are choosing which rock
each of the seven teams will be given.

214
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,524
Let's give the weakest rock to
the couple we dislike the most.

215
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,348
The strength of each couple's love will
be tested at the final location

216
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:03,580
and the couple who possesses the strongest
rock that remain unbroken

217
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,874
will be the ultimate victors.

218
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:06,597
The prize given out to the victors today

219
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,567
are on a different scale than anything else
from which you have ever seen before.

220
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,786
[A whole different scale
of prizes for the winners.]

221
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,639
- A diamond?
- Maybe it really is!

222
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,361
That is all I'm going to tell you.

223
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:20,489
[Winning prize- A one carat diamond.]

224
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,395
- Okay!
- It has to be a diamond.

225
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,436
- Give me a diamond.
- Do you want a diamond?

226
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:29,066
[Why... you can't handle that?]

227
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:35,161
[Chapter Eight- Pureness of Love.]

228
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:42,289
We will now get started with the first game.

229
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,309
Ultimate love's first mission.

230
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,942
It's the Purity of Love which will test
the strength of your male partners.

231
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,616
Something pure?
What's it going to be? Flour?

232
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,592
Why else would they call it that?

233
00:17:56,593 --> 00:18:00,246
The male partners will have to jump through
a course of hurdles from the starting line

234
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,252
and run over to the bouquet that you see
hanging up above in the middle of the field.

235
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:09,125
You will have to catch the bouquet and
bring it to your female partner.

236
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:13,553
But since only one man will be able to
get the bouquet hanging in the middle

237
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:17,062
the remaining partners, will have the
balloons above their heads pop open on them

238
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,727
which are filled with flour.

239
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,216
Oh my God!

240
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,415
Thus, the person who gets the bouquet
will come in at first place in this round.

241
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:27,284
Then there will be another round to determine
the second place, then another for third.

242
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:30,901
Then Hye Jin will become the White Witch,
and no longer be the Gangnam Witch.

243
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,888
- Se Yun!
- Fighting!

244
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,017
[Everyone is cheering on their own partners.]

245

- Seo Joon, it's going to be rough out there.
- Okay.

247

248
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,132
Don't get your hopes up at all.

249
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,869
We're just going to be
showered with the flour.

250
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,424
- We're going to be the White Witches!
- I'm going to win this!

grabbing the bouquet.]

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,636
- Ready!
- Watch out for Narsha.

337
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:25,864
We have to keep our heads up.

338
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,731
[Purity of Love's final round.]

339
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:36,457

[The tallest of the women
are leading the pack!]

341
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,617

342
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:46,060
Se Yun!

343
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,325
[Jin Se Yun takes over the lead!]

344
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,193
Narsha, what are you doing!

345
00:25:56,194 --> 00:25:58,065
What is she doing?

346
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:03,852
[Narsha is taking her sweet old time.]

347
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,656
[Could she possibly be planning
a flour revenge on her partner?]

348
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:14,665
[Could Se Yun take the victory
against everyone's prediction?]

349
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,150
[So close!]

350
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:28,267
[Who will get the bouquet?]

351
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:34,288
[Hye Jin uses her height to her advantage
to get the bouquet in her hands.]

352
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:39,575
[Se Yun steals the bouquet!]

353
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:46,471
[A war of the bouquet.]

354
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,545
[Very anxious partners.]

355
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:52,018
I'm the oldest one here!

356
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,297
My partner is 34 years old!

357
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,750
I'm the oldest one here!

358
00:26:57,986 --> 00:27:01,469
[Ultimately uses her age as her weapon.]

359
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,448
Don't give up!

360
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:08,684
[Who cares about your age!]

361
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:10,784
[Love must be fought for!]

362
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:15,777
[Narsha gets back into the battle of love.]

363
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,869
Get up!

364
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,682
Get up!

365
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:29,013
Young girls these days are so weird!

366
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:32,262
[Young girls of these days are
still battling over the bouquet.]

367
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,517
[Jae Suk now only needs to get
the bouquet in his outstretched hands.]

368
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:39,146
[Huh?]

369
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:42,642
[Against the rules!
Jae Suk steps off the platform.]

370
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:50,476
[Referee Kkuk blows the whistle.]

371
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:53,591
- No, we have to do it over.
- Yoo Jae Suk stepped off his platform.

372
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:56,249
- Why did you step off the platform?
- I had the bouquet in my hands.

373
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,489
[Yoo Hyuk's foul play means
the game has to be restarted.]

374
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,045
He has to be disqualified.

375
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,592
You have to call something
on the shrieker too.

376
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:12,042
'Ah! I'm the oldest one here!'

377
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:15,577
- Stop making her scream like that.
- I'm the oldest and the weakest one here.

378
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:19,067
We're the same age.
Be more understanding of her.

379
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,059
- What's there to be understanding about?
- You have to give her a break.

380
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:25,890
- She screeches like a dolphin.
- She was the only one down on the ground.

381
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:30,911
[The oldest woman cannot compete
in this battle of love.]

382
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,242
[There was a time when I used to be
young like these girls too...]

383
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,268
Young girls these days are so weird!

384
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,263
Okay, here we go.
Ready!

385
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,777
- We have to do this.
- You have to get the bouquet.

386
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,975
Get the bouquet.

387
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,433
[Round two of the bouquet battle.]

388
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,702

[Gangnam Witch is beginning
to show her true colors.]

391

Good, bring it to me.

392
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,798
Se Yun!
Over here, Se Yun.

393
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:24,478
[Witch Hye Jin activates her full power.]

394
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:28,763
[Holding on with all their might...]

395
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:32,025
[But the Witch... is smiling?]

396
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:37,171
[Who will be the ultimate possessor
of the bouquet?]

397
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,675
- Good, over here!
- Se Yun, I'm over here.

398
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:41,519
You're almost there!

399
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,529
[Hye Jin drags all the girls
over to where Ha Ha is standing.]

400

[Ha Ha and Hye Jin win.]

401

[A white Giraffe.]

[Snowy white flower boys.]

403
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,582
Gary, you look so hideous!

404
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:16,662
[He hears that quite often.]

405
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:18,916
Stop saying that!
I already hear that often enough.

406
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,829
Hye Jin!

407
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,740
[The kiddo is ecstatic over
what his partner has done for him.]

408
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:30,453

Gangnam Witch!

409
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:34,134
[This ugly white boy is watching
the scene without uttering a word.]

410
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,728
This bouquet is...

411
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,687
[The ferocity of this love battle
is proven by the state of the bouquet.]

412
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,072
What are we going to do?

413
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:46,446
Getting showered by the flour is one thing

414
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,385
but what's even worse is that Min Ah
was laughing and calling Gary ugly.

415
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:51,366
Gary, you look so hideous!

416
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:54,054
- Who was she saying that to?
- Me.

417
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:59,416
Congratulations to Hye Jin and Ha Ha,
who came in at third place.

418
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,461
[Third place winners- Ha Ha and Hye Jin.]

419
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:03,955
- Gangnam Witch is awesome!
- In second place...

420
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:06,279
We have Kim Jong Kook and Ha Yeon Soo.

421
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,268
And in first place,
we have Song Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.

422
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:15,691
- Get away from me.
- Why do your teeth look so yellow?

423
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:18,095
- What are you talking about?
- Your teeth are looking really yellow.

424
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,626
Yellow teeth are really popular amongst
all the celebrities lately.

425
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,708
[First to lead the new wave of style.]

426
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,171
- It's so yellow.
- Why do they look so yellow?

427
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:30,743
Yellow teeth are the new wave of style.

428
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:38,556
[His partner is gracious enough to
help him whiten his teeth.]

429
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:44,854
The couple that came in at third place can
step forward and receive their hint.

430
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:47,606
[A special hint regarding
the rock that they currently have.]

431
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:52,039
- You look like such an incompetent fool.
- You got lucky with your partner.

432
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,016
The width of Hye Jin's shoulders
are as wide as Jong Kook's shoulders.

433
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,136
How can you say something like that?

434
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:02,347
He really is something else.

435
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:07,506
[Rock exchanging coupon]

436
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:09,914
You see all the rocks, right?

437
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:11,640
Take a good look at all the rocks.

438
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,926
You can exchange your own rock,
or exchange someone else's rock.

439
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,804
- How many times?
- You can only exchange one.

440
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,344
They all look so good.

441
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:27,367
[Checking to see
which rock looks the sturdiest.]

442
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,895
I can't give you too much time, so you
have one minute to make your exchange.

443
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:34,998
[Must exchange it for the sturdiest rock.]

444
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:45,285
[Will the sturdiest looking rock
actually be the sturdiest rock?]

445
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,841
[They exchange their own rock
with Jae Suk's rock.]

446
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,162
I will first give you your own hint.

447
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:53,051
[Second place winners, Jong Kook and Yeon Soo
are given a hint and an exchange coupon.]

448
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,095
[The Moh's hardness scale determines
the hardness of ten different minerals.]

449
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:03,558
[Moh's hardness scale...]

450
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,276
[Sounds like a really big hint for
the unbreakable love mission.]

451
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,142
- Doesn't this look really hard?
- Yes.

452
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:12,631
This looks like a white pebble.

453
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:16,273
Let's swap this one out for this.

454
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:21,629
[They choose to go with the one
that appears to be a white pebble.]

455
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:25,280
That was a good choice.

456
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:26,786
Since you guys came in at first place

457
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,012
you'll get a better hint
than the second place winner.

458
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,429
[The Moh's hardness scale determines
the hardness of ten different minerals.]

459
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,085
[The hardness of your rock is
stronger than that of Jae Suk's team.]

460
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:40,463
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon's is tougher than
Jae Suk and Se Yun's.]

461
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:48,609
[They ultimately decide to exchange
theirs out for Ha Ha and Hye Jin's.]

462
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,793
Okay, first round is now over.

463
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,670
We will now move on to the next location
for our second round of the race.

464
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:57,517
[Unbreakable love- second mission location.]

465
00:33:58,132 --> 00:34:02,704
But Seo Joon, do you know what that hint
from earlier was indicating to?

466
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:06,511
I felt like it was indicating to which of
all the rocks was the strongest

467
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,271
but the wording of the hint
was way too tough to understand.

468
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:12,067
My understanding is that higher
the density rating, easier it is to break.

469
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:13,659
I think I know what you're saying.

470
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,591
Something that is tightly bound together
and really carefully cut into its shape is...

471
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:21,567
But I think that the rock we have right now
may be a pretty strong one.

472
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:28,560
I think that the rock we have and the one
that was right next to ours, are the strong ones.

473
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:32,947
- Which rock is the hardest of them all?
- I think that would be...

474
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:35,507
marble, don't you think?

475
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:39,067
[Isn't marble pretty easy to break?]

476
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:44,250
[Unsure of his questionable guess.]

477
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,111
- You're saying granite is the hardest?
- Of course it is.

478
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:52,775
- Suk Jin is such a weird driver.
- That elder is so frustrating.

479
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,800
Ugh, seriously.

480
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,424
Come on!

481
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:02,513
- He's such an aggressive driver.
- Seriously.

482
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,974
They say that the way a person drives
is a good indicator of their personality.

483
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:08,203
That's right, he's all just a show.
What you see of him is just a facade.

484
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:12,492
Why is he driving so slow when there
aren't even any other cars in front of him?

485
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:16,140
[What is the reason for Big-nose driving
so slow when there isn't even any traffic?]

486
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:17,985
It's because he's never been
in the lead before.

487
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,615
Because he's only used to
following someone else?

488
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:25,133
Maybe you're right.
Now that you say it, I think you're right.

489
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:28,477
[It seems as though Jae Suk
may have a point?]

490
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:31,173
That's why he's driving so hesitantly.

491
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,485
[King of ddakji drives in the path of others.]

492
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,755
Is this where we get off?

493
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:43,229
[Seoul's Samjungdong.]

494
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,808
[Streets filled with tiny shops and cafes-
the perfect spot for romantic dates.]

495
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,562
- What a beautiful day.
- What are we doing in here?

496
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:53,076
[Mission location- Arrives at a cafe.]

497
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,908
I think there's someone here just
to watch the recording of our show.

498
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:59,003
Me?
Are you referring to me?

499
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:01,423
- What are you saying?
- Okay, everyone's now here.

00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:10,944
We've asked you to come to this cafe so that
you could enjoy a nice date with your partner.

502
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,834
This round of games was designed to test
the compatibility of you and your partner.

503
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:17,878
This mission is titled,
Love is a Bounce Bounce.

504
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:21,339
- Love is a bounce bounce.
- You guys are good with the titles.

505
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:25,470
[Chapter Nine- Love is a bounce bounce.]

506
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:31,028
Did you all see what's below you outside?
A trampoline has been set up outside.

507
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:34,290
One person will pose the quiz questions
while jumping on the trampoline

508
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:38,417
while his or her partner can sit in here and
answer the question in ease.

509
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:39,425
Okay, I understand.

510
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:41,388
I think Hye Jin will have to be
the questioner for Ha Ha's team.

511
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,492
We'll figure that out for ourselves.

512
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,897
- You just worry about ourselves.
- Okay, fine.

513
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:49,160
You can also use your body
to pose the questions.

514
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,262
- Song Ji Hyo.
- I'm sorry.

515
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:53,678
Who is it?
I'm curious to know.

516
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:57,730
[Who could be calling her at this time?]

517
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:59,625
Did you get yourself a new boyfriend?

518
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:04,770
At least tell me when you
get yourself one.

519
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:08,710
That way I can be more cautious
of the things that I say to you.

520
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:12,716
[This is the respect between a work couple.]

521
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,315
You need to tell Gary about it
even if you don't tell us about it.

522
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,447
The drama between you two is
so entertaining.

523
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:20,711
[The Pedestrian Couple is enthralled
by the drama between the Monday Couple.]

524
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:22,876
You're breathing down on me too hard.

525
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:27,288
- I'm just breathing.
- My neck is getting cold.

526
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,435
[He's about to catch a cold from the gust
coming from the Giraffe's nose.]

527
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,168
[First challengers- Kwang Soo and Narsha.]

528
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:37,022
Even if Narsha were to ask the questions,
Kwang Soo won't be able to answer them.

529
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:38,548
He's really ignorant, isn't he?

530
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,418
Correct answer!

531
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:47,476
I'm really ignorant too.

532
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,196
[What will be Kwang Soo
and Narsha's category?]

533
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,172
I don't know things like this.

534
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:56,514
[Person and Character.]

535
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:59,932
It's about men who you become more and more
attracted to the more you see him.

536
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,387
[Who, me?]

537
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:05,665
Wow, we have to win this.
We have to place in the top three.

538
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:09,292
You look like the heroine
of a romantic comedy.

539
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:13,197
[The heroine of a bickering romantic comedy?
Kwang-Sha Couple?]

540
00:38:13,198 --> 00:38:15,409
It is a romantic comedy
but there needs to be different stars in it.

541
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:19,819
[The classic friend couple.]

542
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:23,933
They don't look like a couple in love.

543
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:30,209
[Outside the café window...
is a large trampoline for the questioner.]

544
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:34,861
[He must jump high enough to peek into
the cafe window on the second floor.]

545
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:42,877
- Look at Kwang Soo already.
- I can totally see him.

546
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,541
But he looks so scary.

547
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,127
[The Kwang Ghost.]

548
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:56,430
I'm scared!

549
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,860
[The concept was definitely
supposed to be romantic...]

550
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,082
Do it with a smile on his face.

551
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:07,147
[Like this?]

552
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,854
No, never mind.
Don't smile.

553
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,528
[Narsha... accept my love for you.]

554
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,352
- He looks like a monster.
- He really is something.

555
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:23,803
[Correctly answer the most number of questions
within 60 seconds to win the mission.]

556
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,328
Ready, set, go.

557
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:34,524
I think I know what it is.

558
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:37,854
[Wait, that's...]

559
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,890
Batman!

560
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,916
[Batman- Correct answer.]

561
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:52,020
[The next question is?]

562
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,612
Jo In Sung!

563
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,438
[Jo In Sung- Correct answer.]

564
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:03,230
- This is easy.
- This is way too easy.

565
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:10,245
I'm home all alone!

566
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,496

[Four correct answer already!
Spiderman- Correct answer.]

570
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,296
- He's really good.
- He's blowing his nose.

571
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,380
I think he's an elephant.

572
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,647
- He's blowing his nose.
- I think I know what it is.

573
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,347
Bruce Lee.

00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:48,837
[Bruce Lee- Correct answer.]

575
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,405
She's really good.

576
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,082
Loyalty!

577
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,725
[This man?]

578
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:02,138
- Loyalty!
- What?

579
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:04,892
Ah, Kim Bo Sung!

580
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:07,204
[Kim Bo Sung- Correct answer.]

581
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,260
[Time over]

582
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:14,432
[Kwang Soo and Narsha-
Six questions answered correctly.]

583
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:30,110
Kwang Soo and Narsha succeeded in
answering six questions correctly.

584
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,545
I think we got a quite a few
answered correctly.

585
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,599
But that really makes a person
a little bit teary eyed.

586
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,286
- That's going to be you soon.
- I'm not doing it.

587
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:45,954
I'm not doing it.
Hee's going to do it.

588
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:49,322
- I'm not doing.
- Your selfishness really is impressive.

[Men's idol: Big-nose, the Bad Boy.

[Big-nose, The Man!]

592
00:42:00,761 --> 00:42:02,863
You're going to be screaming
on that trampoline out there.

593
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:05,541
I'm not good at posing the questions.

- I think this is going to be hard.
- What is it?

[Songs]

597
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:14,996
You have to correctly guess the songs that
couples like to sing at karaoke bars.

598
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,599
You want us to use our bodies to
sing and describe the songs?

599
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,747
[It seems as though their category
was quite the easy one.]

600
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,635

We're in big trouble.

[I can't see...]

605
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:52,968
This is bad.

['Gangnam Style'- Psy.]

616
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,712

What did he say?

618
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:41,603

- My style!

[Time over]

00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,072
It was 'While Missing You'.

640
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,216
Gary and Min Ah correctly
answered two questions.

641
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:22,260

672
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:03,153
[Tiger- Correct answer.]

673
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:10,374
What's this?

674
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,276
He's going to lose.

675
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:17,086
- What's that sound?
- Suk Jin's collapsed out there.

676
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,473
- You don't know that sound?
- Ah, the woodpecker!

677
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:26,536
[Woodpecker- Correct answer.]

678
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:30,163
Alligator.

679
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:34,166
[Next question- Alligator.]

680
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,028
What's that?

681
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,924
- It's a slate.
- Slate?

682
00:47:44,188 --> 00:47:45,887
Purse!

683
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:50,342
[Losing strength from both
of his legs...]

684
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:52,166
- Hurry!
- He's collapsed out there.

685
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,113
Suk Jin!

686
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,637
- I'm tearing up.
- Where is he?

687
00:47:59,372 --> 00:48:00,594
Rabbit!

688
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:02,507
[Rabbit- Correct answer.]

689
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:05,290
[Three answers correct-
Better than expected.]

690
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:09,125
[All they can hear is his screams.]

691
00:48:09,685 --> 00:48:11,998
- What is that?
- It's because he's having fun.

692
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:14,720
It's because he's having fun
jumping on the trampoline.

693
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:16,810
[Big-nose is having fun jumping down
memory lane on the trampoline?]

694
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,240
Curly!
Animal with the curly hair!

695
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:25,634
Lion?

696
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,867
[Lion- Correct answer.]

697
00:48:30,546 --> 00:48:33,943
[What is he doing?
Sticking out his tongue?]

698
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:40,886
A fly?

699
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,870
Snake?

700
00:48:45,871 --> 00:48:47,998
[Snake- Correct answer.]

701
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,309
Hippo.

702
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,312
[Time over.]

703
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:55,115
Is 'Ah' all he can say out there?

704
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:09,392
[All the animals makes the same sound.]

705
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,715
This is way too hard.

706
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,693
- We'll go next. Hye Jin is going to do it.
- Why am I going out there?

707
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:20,334
Okay.

708
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:24,515
[Is Hye Jin really going out
to the trampoline?]

709
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:27,559
We have to show them how
good we are.

710
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,935
Hye Jin's going to get a workout.

711
00:49:29,936 --> 00:49:34,018
- Hye Jin is going to be better than Ha Ha.
- She was already 168cm tall in grade school.

712
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,027
- Why are you bringing that up?
- She was the tallest in her class.

713
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,103
- Love!
- How am I to express that?

714
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:46,640
- It's because she's much taller than me.
- I'm not that much taller than you.

715
00:49:53,731 --> 00:49:56,536
[Bratty little kid.]

716
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:57,926
Fighting!

717
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:00,586
[Gangnam Witch, Hye Jin!]

718
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:03,414
Se Yun, it seems as though this is the
way it's going to go. Get yourself ready.

719
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:11,429
[The bad boy concept seems to be
going wide spread on Running Man.]

720
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,219
[Due to the fault of being taller
than Ha Ha...]

721
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:18,949
Wow, this is really scary.
This is scary.

722
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,218
This is really hard.

723
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:21,616
Set, go!

724
00:50:22,744 --> 00:50:24,405
I can see her hands.

725
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:27,292
[What's he doing?]

726
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,207
[Question- Playing hard to get.]

727
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,765
[Is she cheering?]

728
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:38,087
[The shake?]

729
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:39,950
What is she doing?

730
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,720
[Pass]

731
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,147
[The next love question is?]

732
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,245
What is she doing?

733
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:59,001
Kiss!

734
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:01,088
[Kiss- Correct answer.]

735
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,317
I can't see her at all.
What was that?

736
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:08,029
What could that be?
What is this?

737
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:11,194
Put your hands up.

738
00:51:11,195 --> 00:51:12,967
Praying?
Is she praying?

739
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:18,406
Marry me!
Marry me!

740
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:22,674
Proposal!

741
00:51:22,675 --> 00:51:25,048
[Proposal- Correct answer.]

742
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,225
She's giving someone roses.
A ring!

743
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:30,742
Diamond ring!

744
00:51:30,743 --> 00:51:32,044
A wedding ring!

745
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:35,515
[It's very close...]

746
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:37,552
Why can't he get this?

747
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,159
Okay, a couple ring!

748
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,972
[Couple ring- Correct answer.]

749
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,497
[Three correct answers!]

750
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:45,610
What is that?
A paper?

751
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:47,990
Three?

752
00:51:49,012 --> 00:51:51,567
- I love three.
- Samgyetang.

753
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,449
Three?

754
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,977
Three?

755
00:51:57,978 --> 00:51:59,640
What about three?

756
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:05,122
[Time over.]

757
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,844
- Love triangle.
- Ah, a love triangle.

758
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:11,804
[A very sensible explanation.
Hye Jin is looking exhausted.]

759
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:18,546
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin- Three correct answers.]

760
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:20,976
[Kwang Soo and Narsha are currently
in first place.]

761
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,647
Ha Dong Hoon, get over here.

762
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:25,248
What?

763
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:27,970
- What's wrong?
- He correctly answered three questions.

764
00:52:27,971 --> 00:52:30,535
- I got three questions.
- He only got three questions correct?

765
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:33,175
You should've explained it better.

766
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:37,253
[Gangnam Witch definitely is
a force to be reckoned with.]

767
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,816
So we need to beat six?

768
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:41,779
It's person and character.

769
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,908
[Jae Suk and Se Yun get
the person and character category.]

770
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:47,499
I think they're going to do well.

771
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,657
He's doing well.

772
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:58,396
I just saw him fall.
He just fell so pathetically.

773
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:10,364
[Act up too much... and you'll
completely humiliate yourself.]

774
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:15,658
[But his jumping skills are quite good.
Able to see him pretty easily.]

775
00:53:18,706 --> 00:53:21,446
[Jae Suk and Se Yun- Start.]

776
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:26,479
[First question- Dooley.]

777
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,339
Jump rope?

778
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:32,167
[Interference]

779
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:34,486
[Dancing wildly.]

780
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:36,782
- I don't think I get it.
- What's he doing out there?

781
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:40,682
He's jump roping.

782
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,417
Pass.

783
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:46,956
[Next question- The Hulk.]

784
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:53,986
[I am The Hulk!]

785
00:53:57,884 --> 00:53:59,762
He fell down while screaming.

786
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:05,122
[Second fall.]

787
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,389
[How humiliating for him...]

788
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:23,604
[Describing The Hulk
with the use of his entire body.]

789
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:29,730
[Third fall.]

790
00:54:29,843 --> 00:54:32,879
This isn't going to work.
I'm going to have to explain it.

791
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,278
What's wrong with him?

792
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,741
An alien?
Yoda!

793
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:39,048
[Yoda?]

794
00:54:41,688 --> 00:54:44,854
[The Hulk is transforming himself
right in front of our very own eyes.]

795
00:54:44,855 --> 00:54:46,984
Don't you even feel sorry for him?

796
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,115
Dracula?

797
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:54,160
[Time over- Zero questions
answered for Jae Suk's team.]

798
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:58,697
[Yoda passes out.]

799
00:55:02,085 --> 00:55:05,819
How was I supposed to...
How am I supposed to describe The Hulk?

800
00:55:07,218 --> 00:55:09,240
You seriously didn't get it?

801
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,078
The first one was Dooley.

802
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,288
- What was this?
- The Hulk.

803
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,971
I barely stopped myself from
tearing my shirt open.

804
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,066
When you pulled the shirt over your head,
you looked just like Yoda.

805
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,644
- I almost ripped my shirt open.
- We thought you were ET.

806
00:55:24,414 --> 00:55:27,103
- I can't believe you didn't get any.
- I couldn't get any of it.

807
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:28,405
It's okay, there's the next game.

808
00:55:28,406 --> 00:55:30,029
Did you notice that
Jae Suk's not even looking at you?

809
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,843
He hasn't looked at you
for the past two minutes.

810
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:39,675
[Next- Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.
Category- Animals.]

811
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:43,231
[Seo Joon's impressive jumping skills.]

812
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:45,488
- He's such a great jumper.
- I'm sorry.

813
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,899
[Question- Giraffe.
How will be describe this one?]

814
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,758
[Seo Joon flies straight up into the air.]

815
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:56,029
[Huh?]

816
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,029
[That's supposed to be a giraffe?]

817
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:07,780
He's a really great jumper,
but he can't describe it at all.

818
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,541
[Great jumping skills,
but bad explanation skills.]

819
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:10,818
Pass.

820
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:19,545
[Much less...
can't even keep his balance.]

821
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,099
Wow, this is hard.

822
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:26,847
[Question- A frilled lizard.]

823
00:56:26,848 --> 00:56:29,030
[What is he trying to describe?]

824
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:31,320
[Blank Ji is slowly starting
to get angry.]

825
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,580
Seo Joon must be really struggling right now.

826
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:38,460
[Next question- Fly.]

827
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:43,366
[Comes... and goes...]

828
00:56:45,163 --> 00:56:46,943
[Oh no, what's he going to do?]

829
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:48,905
- A bug!
- A bug?

830
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:53,687
You're really bad at explaining things.

831
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:59,232
[Time over for Blank Ji.]

832
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:02,601
We actually did a good job with ours.

833
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:06,190
How is this a frilled lizard?
This is a frilled lizard!

834
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:09,758
[I'm dead.]

835
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,333
This is a fly!

836
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,322
How is this a fly?

837
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,731
[Ji Hyo... go easy on me.]

838
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,514
[Time to swap out their rocks.]

839
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:27,913
[Just what role will these rocks play
in the final mission?]

840
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:29,844
Suk Jin and Choi Hee may come up
for having come in at third place.

841
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:33,176
[Results of the mission:
Third place- Suk Jin and Choi Hee.]

842
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:36,926
[Second place- Gary and Min Ah.
First place- Kwang Soo and Narsha.]

843
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,057
You guys got lucky.

844
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:42,438
[Exchange coupon.]

845
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:45,146
[First, second and third place winners
are each given an exchange coupon.]

846
00:57:45,147 --> 00:57:46,825
Do you see anything that you
especially want?

847
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:49,354
He passes over all the difficult decisions
onto his partner.

848
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:51,971
[Bad Boy Big-nose passes on all
the tough decisions onto his partner.]

849
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:55,154
- He's such a guy.
- Women are better with jewels.

850
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:58,356
I don't think this is it.
This one looks weak to me.

851
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:01,708
[She thinks that Ji Hyo and Seo Joon's rock
appears to be too weak.]

852
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:06,351
[The final mission and the purpose of
these rocks are still unknown to them all.]

853
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:08,275
You choose.

854
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,867
That one?

855
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:13,261
No, that looks too weak.

856
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:19,017
Two.

857
00:58:19,018 --> 00:58:22,218
- One. Make your decision.
- No, Suk Jin! It's this one!

858
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:24,988
[Big-nose ultimately makes the decision
to swap theirs out for Ji Hyo and Seo Joon's.]

859
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:26,369
Go back to your own seats.

860
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:29,094
This one looks much stronger.

861
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:30,952
Let's trade it out with the egg.

862
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:33,074
[What?]

863
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:38,494
[Gary believes that there's something with
the egg and gambles on the chance.]

864
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:44,817
[What? An egg?]

865
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:46,787
Why would you have done that?

866
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:51,897
[What luck! Kwang Soo
and Narsha get rid of their egg!]

867
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:53,694
[Lastly, it's time for the first place winners
to swap out their rock.]

868
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:57,825
[Find the strongest looking rock.]

869
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,482
What the heck?

870
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:04,361
[Whatever!]

871
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:05,715
Let go!

872
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:09,416
[Giraffe explodes.]

873
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,091
What?

874
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:15,300
[They should be swapping theirs out
for a rock stronger than their own...]

875
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:18,780
You're asking me to trust you?

876
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,772
What happened with ours?

877
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:25,233
[Keeping the one they have.]

878
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:27,280
[Just trust me.]

879
00:59:27,842 --> 00:59:31,532
[All three teams complete
making their decision.]

880
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,725
The next mission will be
your final mission.

881
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:35,978
If we don't come in at first place,
then is that the end for us?

882
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:37,644
- Yes.
- I understand.

883
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,228
You heard what he said, right?

884
00:59:40,229 --> 00:59:43,651
Couples like Yoo Jae Suk's couple who
don't even know what they have

885
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,572
or haven't even been able to swap theirs out
are at a great disadvantage at the moment.

886
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:49,027
We haven't even been able
to get close to it.

887
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:50,775
This will be your final mission.

888
00:59:50,776 --> 00:59:52,766
This will be your last chance.
Okay, everyone on their way.

889
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:57,168
[Unbreakable Love-
Off to their next location.]

890
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:04,939
[Chapter Ten- Love is Hot.]

891
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,396
[Arrives at the next date spot.]

892
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:15,015
I can already smell all the spicy food.

893
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:22,315
It's a really popular dating spot.
Ddeokbokki restaurant.

894
01:00:23,761 --> 01:00:26,627
We really have to come in
at first place this time.

895
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:30,942
There is a team who hasn't even
been able to swap out their rocks.

896
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:34,522
[Jae Suk and Se Yun haven't had
any chance to swap out their rock.]

897
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:39,176
[Unbreakable Love- Love is Hot.]

898
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,938
We will give each of the teams
a steaming bowl of ddeokbokki.

899
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:47,129
[Each team is given 20 ddeokbokki pieces.]

900
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,426
[After the mission is over,
it's time for a ddeokbokki  party.]

901
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,090
We will announce a very simple
couple game

902
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:57,892
and we will do a drawing of the team
that will first come up to take the challenge.

903
01:00:57,893 --> 01:01:02,531
Then that couple will come forward and choose
the team they'd like to play the game with.

904
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:07,022
The teams that aren't playing the game will
choose which team they think is going to win

905
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:08,555
and bet as many ddeokbokki pieces
they'd like to bet on the game.

906
01:01:08,649 --> 01:01:13,544
[The first team to get rid of all their
20 ddeokbokki pieces will win the game.]

907
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:19,457
First game is, Love is a relay match.
The partners will tie their ankles together.

908
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:22,898
And they will push the other team down.
It's a sort of a push game.

909
01:01:22,899 --> 01:01:25,439
So the team that pushes the other team down
will win the game.

910
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,940
So it's two against two?

911
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:29,950
I will now choose the team who will
first participate in this game.

912
01:01:29,951 --> 01:01:31,719
[Time to draw the team
who will be playing the game.]

913
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:35,541
Who will be the first team to play?

914
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,490
Ha Ha and Han Hye Jin.

915
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,191
They're not of the same height.
Will that be alright?

916
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,377
So they'll have to choose the team that
they're sure they can beat as their opponents?

917
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:46,690
[In order to win the game,
they'll have to choose an easy opponent.]

918
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:49,715
[Who will Ha Ha and Hye Jin choose?]

919
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,213
One, two, three.

920
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:59,553
[Without a doubt- Suk Jin and Choi Hee.]

921
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,526
You think we're that easy?

922
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:04,473
- I'm going to bet on Suk Jin.
- I'm nervous.

923
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:07,243
I'm sorry to tell you this, but I'm
not shaking my hand on purpose.

924
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,432
[Big-nose's overly-obvious hand shake.]

925
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:16,941
I'm depleted of all my energy right now.

926
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:20,022
Just please go to the hospital.

927
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:22,352
Take yourself to the hospital!

928
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:27,928
[The winner of ddakjji war!
After effects of ddakjji efforts.]

929
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,178
And it's because you did too many
of this earlier too.

930
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:35,030
[And even all the animal charades
that he had to do earlier.]

931
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:39,339
[Middle aged man's hand shake
from all the strenuous activities.]

932
01:02:40,867 --> 01:02:44,223
We're going to bet on Ha Ha and Hye Jin.

933
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,836
We're going to bet on Dong Hoon and Hye Jin.

934
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:50,963
- Are you guys seriously?
- We're also betting on Ha Ha and Hye Jin.

935
01:02:51,774 --> 01:02:54,235
Do we just bet on
who we think is going to win?

936
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:56,439
- Then Ha Ha.
- Yeon Soo!

937
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,951
[Everyone's betting five ddeokbokki pieces
on Ha Ha and Hye Jin.]

938
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,150
[Every single team is betting
their pieces on Ha Ha and Hye Jin's win.]

939
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:03,438
Everyone that followed Jae Suk's bet
is going to end up regretting it.

940
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:06,143
- Jae Suk, who did you bet on again?
- I'm not good at things like this.

941
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:09,563
- I placed my bet on Ha Ha.
- He really is bad at things like this.

942
01:03:09,564 --> 01:03:12,068
I'm just asking out of curiosity,
but did anyone bet on us?

943
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:13,464
No, no one.

944
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,301
Not a single one of you?

945
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:18,791
[Other than themselves, not a single team
placed their bet on Suk Jin and Choi Hee.]

946
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:21,440
If you lose your footing at all,
then you fail the game.

947
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:23,092
Keep your legs strong.

948
01:03:23,093 --> 01:03:27,625
- Han Hye Jin!
- What the heck?

949
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:32,305
[Every single team is cheering on
Ha Ha and Hye Jin's team.]

950
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,018
Ready.

951
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:40,317
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin vs Suk Jin and Choi Hee.]

952
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:44,400
You can't let him beat you, Dong Hoon!

953
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,978
I'm going to win this!

954
01:03:45,979 --> 01:03:47,913
I'm not going to lose.

955
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:51,821
[Big-nose immediately launches
his attack on Hye Jin.]

956
01:03:51,822 --> 01:03:53,795
[Unreal.]

957
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:04,575
[The battle between the two men
to protect their own loves.]

958
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:17,324
- Ugh, I'm so angry.
- This is too much.

959
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,785
Let's all use both of our hands.

960
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:25,211
[Okay, let's do this for real!]

961
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:30,796
[Kiddo is put in danger
as soon as they start.]

962
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:35,640
[A fiery match between the two teams.]

963
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:49,108
[This is how it's supposed to be played!]

964
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:52,936
[This is the fiery match
which we've all been waiting for!]

965
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,011
[Oh? Everyone had placed their bet
on Ha Ha and Hye Jin!]

966
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:09,969
[We're ruined!]

967
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:15,447
[Suk Jin and Choi Hee win!]

968
01:05:18,355 --> 01:05:20,409
- Wait a minute.
- Choi Hee!

969
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,233
[Completely unexpected turn of events.]

970
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,300
You did good.

971
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:29,826
[Big-nose's miracle still continues.]

972
01:05:33,615 --> 01:05:35,901
[Meanwhile, ddeokbokki is cooking
deliciously on the stove.]

973
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:40,313
Ji Suk Jin and Choi Hee were the only ones
who were able to get rid of five pieces.

974
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:43,636
This really isn't going well.

975
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:46,278
Just bet the opposite of
whatever Jae Suk bets on.

976
01:05:46,313 --> 01:05:49,473
[A hundred percent guarantee that
whatever Jae Suk bets on will lose.]

977
01:05:49,474 --> 01:05:52,220
Here's your second game.
Second game is, Love's Sweet Radish.

978
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:54,980
- Is it like the cookie stick game?
- Yes, you're correct.

979
01:05:54,981 --> 01:05:57,288
We will be playing the cookie stick game
with a sweet radish piece.

980
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:59,373
The team with the shorter piece
will win the game.

981
01:05:59,374 --> 01:06:01,356
I will pick the team who will
come up first.

982
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:07,754
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.]

983
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:10,871
Wait a minute.
Are you sure?

984
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:12,630
Are you sure about this?

985
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:19,081
What are you guys whispering about?
Let's just get this over with!

986
01:06:19,752 --> 01:06:22,796
- Jong Kook.
- That's right.

987
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:23,896
[Jong Kook and Yeon Soo.]

988
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,341
I'm going to bet on you guys.

989
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:29,725
[Love's Sweet Radish-
Ji Hyo, Seo Joon vs Jong Kook, Yeon Soo]

990
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:31,677
Seo Joon, please take good care of me.

991
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:34,048
If you back away, then it's over for us.

992
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:35,965
- I know.
- I'm going to win this.

993
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,527
[Yeon Soo is showing off
her competitive streak.]

994
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,969
You need to stand up and announce
who you're going to place your bet on.

995
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,443
- Can Jae Suk place his bet first?
- Then everyone's going to bet against him.

996
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:47,802
[Everyone wants to avoid Jae Suk's curse.]

997
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,394
I...

998
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:53,403
Everyone's looking at me right now.

999
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:55,179
You're making us nervous.
Hurry up and place your bet.

1000
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,804
Yeon Soo will be the only one going here,
but both of them will go on this team.

1001
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:01,050
[Guessing that the two actors,
Ji Hyo and Seo Joon will be the safer bet.]

1002
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:03,049
Suk Jin, we're both actors.

1003
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:06,883
Okay.

1004
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:09,955
Se Yun and I are going to bet
on Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.

1005
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:12,889
Kim Jong Kook!

1006
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:16,495
[The rest of the teams are placing
their bets on Jong Kook and Yeon Soo.]

1007
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:18,725
We're ruined!

1008
01:07:18,726 --> 01:07:21,787
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon are looking
dismayed at Jae Suk's selection.]

1009
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:25,486
We're going to place all our faith
on you and Seo Joon.

1010
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:28,321
[Will Jae Suk's curse continue on?]

1011
01:07:28,322 --> 01:07:29,814
- We're placing all our faith in you two.
- Seriously!

1012
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:34,394
In order to keep it really short,
you have to bit it when your teeth touch.

1013
01:07:34,395 --> 01:07:36,218
Don't even think about biting off
until I tell you to do so, okay?

1014
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:41,816
[I'm going to win this!]

1015
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:43,728
- Okay.
- She's the best.

1016
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:45,858
- She's going to win this.
- We have to decide who'll go first.

1017
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:48,838
You decide who gets to go first yourselves.
You can decide however you want.

1018
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,657
How about we arm wrestle for it?

1019
01:07:51,093 --> 01:07:54,558
[That's a cheap shot.]

1020
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,272
Oops, I'm sorry.

1021
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:01,828
We'll play Rock, Paper, Scissors for it.

1022
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,172
Rock, paper, scissors!

1023
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,121
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon to go first.]

1024
01:08:13,701 --> 01:08:16,141
[Competitive Yeon Soo.]

1025
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:18,842
I think we're really going to win this
as long as we bet against Jae Suk.

1026
01:08:18,843 --> 01:08:20,096
Seo Joon.

1027
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,943
Seriously, Jae Suk!

1028
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,738
Don't worry, Ji Hyo.

1029
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:25,620
Do we pick it up with our fingers?

1030
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:29,423
Don't think about what kind of a relationship
you two guys have with each other.

1031
01:08:29,424 --> 01:08:33,177
Just play the game and you can just
end it after the game is over. There you go.

1032
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:35,059
- That looks good.
- This is so fun to watch.

1033
01:08:35,752 --> 01:08:37,051
Ready.

1034
01:08:37,052 --> 01:08:38,837
Why are you getting up so close?

1035
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,811
What are you doing, Narsha?

1036
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:44,918
- What is the matter with this lady?
- I want to get a good look.

1037
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:46,370
[We're ready to go.]

1038
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:59,574
[You never imagined that this would be
happening when you met this morning, did you?]

1039
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:01,872
<i>By any chance... are you my partner?</i>

1040
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:05,223
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1041
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:10,101
[Who knew that this fateful meeting...]

1042
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:15,066
[would lead to such a glorious event?]

1043
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:18,748
Good, they're doing great.

1044
01:09:34,324 --> 01:09:36,326
There you go.
You're doing really great!

1045
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:53,409
I told you that we're actors!

1046
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:58,208
[Jae Suk is the only one ecstatic
at the result of Ji Hyo and Seo Joon's turn.]

1047
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:00,320
How big is it?

1048
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:03,002
Wow, you guys really were amazing.

1049
01:10:03,003 --> 01:10:05,366
Look at how amazing this is.

1050
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,961
This is barely a slice!

1051
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:13,573
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon turned the
sweet radish into a barely even a slice.]

1052
01:10:14,486 --> 01:10:15,863
Wow, this really is...

1053
01:10:15,864 --> 01:10:18,498
This is barely even a slice!

1054
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,945
I can't help but laugh as I'm
measuring this.

1055
01:10:22,946 --> 01:10:25,211
[Unable to stop his laughter.]

1056
01:10:25,212 --> 01:10:26,868
- I'm so happy right now.
- Hurry up and measure it.

1057
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,907
You guys are couple of treasures.

1058
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:31,743
You guys are really...
Don't go anywhere today.

1059
01:10:33,414 --> 01:10:36,329
[Jae Suk just might take them out
for a steak dinner.]

1060
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,310
Wow, this really is unbelievable.

1061
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:42,138
- Four?
- 4 mm.

1062
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:43,750
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon- 4 mm.]

1063
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:47,781
[An unbelievable record
befitting of their actor status.]

1064
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:50,860
- Jong Kook...
- But...

1065
01:10:51,339 --> 01:10:54,254
It needs to be paper thin.
We need to be able to see through it.

1066
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,430
It needs to be see through.

1067
01:10:57,431 --> 01:11:00,437
[You have to do it like this.]

1068
01:11:02,497 --> 01:11:04,484
You have to touch each other's mouth.

1069
01:11:04,485 --> 01:11:08,732
[In the midst of all this,
Yeon Soo is busy picking out their radish.]

1070
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:11,034
- Yeon Soo.
- Hang on.

1071
01:11:11,035 --> 01:11:15,408
I'm going to say this right now, but you
know that our lips will have to touch?

1072
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,769
[Only thing Yeon Soo is thinking about
is how they can win the game.]

1073
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:24,640
- She's an actress too.
- I'm going to go with this one.

1074
01:11:25,826 --> 01:11:28,729
- We're going to go with this one.
- Pull the table up a little bit.

1075
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,110
Sure, let me do that for you.

1076
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:37,066
- When we both feel it, then let's...
- What are you going to be feeling?

1077
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:40,022
[Feel what?]

1078
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:42,852
I meant when we both feel that
it's down to a very small size.

1079
01:11:42,853 --> 01:11:45,806
You can't have just the lips meet,
but your teeth have to touch.

1080
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:48,631
[Must get close enough for
their teeth to touch one another's.]

1081
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:51,489
- I know, I know. We got it.
- Take it slow.

1082
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,310
Which way are you more comfortable.
Let me see here.

1083
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,813
- You can grab each other on the shoulder.
- Tap me on the shoulder as a signal.

1084
01:12:00,009 --> 01:12:02,610
It's because we won't be able to speak.

1085
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:05,826
When you feel that you're ready,
lift up one foot like this behind you.

1086
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:08,280
[Kkuk should lift up his foot
when he's ready?]

1087
01:12:11,072 --> 01:12:13,715
She's a professional.
Don't worry about her.

1088
01:12:13,716 --> 01:12:16,332
We'll go slow.
Okay, we're going to get started.

1089
01:12:16,822 --> 01:12:19,100
I don't know if this is going to be okay.

1090
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:20,582
Should we start?

1091
01:12:21,674 --> 01:12:23,879
I'm sorry, but why is everyone staring?

1092
01:12:24,311 --> 01:12:27,394
[So that we could all see better!]

1093
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:32,241
I'm sorry,
but this is just too good to miss out on.

1094
01:12:34,286 --> 01:12:38,030
[All the spectators are lining up to watch.]

1095
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:41,669
- We're going to win this.
- I'll go this way, okay?

1096
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,869
- You can bite it off, okay?
- Okay.

1097
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,053
Here we go!

1098
01:12:47,747 --> 01:12:50,471
[One competitive girl...]

1099
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:53,450
[And one very bashful man.]

1100
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:55,010
Please put down your hand.

1101
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:57,382
Set, go.
There's no need to be in a rush.

1102
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:15,466
[Stop!]

1103
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:24,958
What is this!

1104
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:27,608
It's like a piece of pulp.
It's totally pulp now.

1105
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,589
What the heck is this!

1106
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:33,818
[The tiniest sweet radish particle.]

1107
01:13:34,688 --> 01:13:36,696
This isn't sweet radish.
It's Jong Kook's tooth.

1108
01:13:37,631 --> 01:13:39,520
Jong Kook lost one of his teeth.

1109
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:42,434
[The radish is the size of
one of Jong Kook's teeth.]

1110
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:46,323
- I'm supposed to measure this part?
- What kind of a kiss was that?

1111
01:13:46,324 --> 01:13:48,411
That was a sweet radish kiss.

1112
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:50,565
The producers can decide on this one.

1113
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:52,890
Wow, Yeon Soo is something else.

1114
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:56,176
If I were to speak for
the rest of the producers...

1115
01:13:56,921 --> 01:14:00,350
- With only a 0.1mm difference...
- Be very precise about this.

1116
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:02,584
This is a very precise calculation.

1117
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:04,818
Kim Jong Kook and Yeon Soo win.

1118
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:07,400
[With only a 0.1mm difference,
Jong Kook and Yeon Soo wins.]

1119
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,730
[Jae Suk's curse continues on.]

1120
01:14:19,108 --> 01:14:21,073
What have you done to us!

1121
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:25,008
[Yeon Soo's impressive work!]

1122
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:34,627
[Jae Suk's never-ending curse.]

1123
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,343
We really are all over without even
having seen our rock even once.

1124
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,136
Currently in first place...

1125
01:14:43,137 --> 01:14:46,892
is Suk Jin and Choi Hee with ten less
ddeokbokki pieces than anyone else.

1126
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:50,211
Then there are two teams who share
the last place spot.

1127
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:53,973
Yoo Jae Suk and Song Ji Hyo teams
both each have 20 ddeokbokki pieces.

1128
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:55,870
- This isn't over yet.
- No, it's not over yet.

1129
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,960
- So they're tied?
- Seo Joon and Ji Hyo did so well too.

1130
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:05,189
[Ddeokbokki is almost finished cooking...]

1131
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,793
This is your third round.

1132
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:11,500
I had no idea that a simple game would
exhaust me out like this.

1133
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,048
Yeah, I bet it did.

1134
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:18,859
Yeah, I bet you're tired.

1135
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,201
Then have you finally decided
that your heart belongs to Yeon Soo?

1136
01:15:21,202 --> 01:15:23,920
- He's finally moved on from 'her'.
- Round three.

1137
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:25,388
Goodbye.

1138
01:15:25,389 --> 01:15:26,905
Seriously!

1139
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:29,842
- What?
- Stop it.

1140
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:34,148
Can't I even say goodbye
to someone I'm friends with?

1141
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,268
[Goodbye... it's all over now.]

1142
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:43,501
The next game is... Egg Love You.

1143
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:44,609
It must have something to do with an egg.

1144
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:49,247
You have to crack and peel a hardboiled egg
on your head and eat it.

1145
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:52,599
But there could be a raw egg.

1146
01:15:53,575 --> 01:15:55,156
<i>It's always Kwang Soo.</i>

1147
01:15:55,157 --> 01:16:00,158
[The very same game that the variety gods
have gifted Kwang Soo with.]

1148
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,599
- You have to crack it on your partner's head.
- This truly is all about luck.

1149
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,151
- Then you'll have to eat it.
- On your partner's head?

1150
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:10,583
- Yes, on your partner's head.
- This for sure will be Kwang Soo.

1151
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,712
Okay, us three teams will do it.
Let's all bet ten pieces each.

1152
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:17,129
[Gary-Min Ah, Kwang Soo-Narsha,
Jae Suk-Se Yun are up.]

1153
01:16:18,148 --> 01:16:22,243
You have to bet on the losing team.
- I bet ten pieces on Yoo Jae Suk.

1154
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:27,504
- We'll bet ten pieces on Kwang Soo.
- We bet ten on Gary.

1155
01:16:27,788 --> 01:16:29,967
There's no need to draw this out.

1156
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:32,291
- Let's just move this along.
- Do it quickly.

1157
01:16:32,848 --> 01:16:35,551
- Let's go, Se Yun.
- Once you grab it, then it's yours.

1158
01:16:35,552 --> 01:16:37,478
You can't touch it to test it out.

1159
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:39,983
[Jae Suk and Se Yun goes first.]

1160
01:16:42,074 --> 01:16:44,113
[Jae Suk and Se Yun- A hardboiled egg.]

1161
01:16:44,114 --> 01:16:46,301
Se Yun, you have to smash it harder.

1162
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:48,313
- Smash it harder.
- This is good.

1163
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:54,634
[Kwang Soo and Narsha's turn.]

1164
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:56,119
There's not much time.

1165
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,959
[Will Kwang Soo get it
in the first try again?]

1166
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,893
Two, one.

1167
01:17:00,894 --> 01:17:02,831
You have to smash it as soon
as you grab it.

1168
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:04,457
One, two, three.

1169
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:08,441
[Hardboiled egg.]

1170
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:12,594
[This is what you call entertaining.]

1171
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,374
That's how you do it.

1172
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,253
That's how you smash it, Se Yun.
Smash it really hard.

1173
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:18,375
You did good.
You did really good, Narsha.

1174
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,074
[Gary and Min Ah's turn.]

1175
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:27,779
[Hardboiled egg.]

1176
01:17:31,469 --> 01:17:33,340
[Sorry, Gary.]

1177
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,506
[One full round is made,
and it's back to Jae Suk and Se Yun.]

1178
01:17:37,507 --> 01:17:39,523
- This one is it.
- Raw egg!

1179
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:47,439
[Jae Suk and Se Yun get the raw egg.]

1180
01:17:50,853 --> 01:17:55,930
[Even though he's covered in raw egg,
Jae Suk and Se Yun still wins!]

1181
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,591
Wow, Suk Jin.

1182
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:02,088
Suk Jin's in first place,
and I'm in second place!

1183
01:18:04,421 --> 01:18:07,689
[They finally get to see their rock.]

1184
01:18:07,909 --> 01:18:09,241
I'm sure that you all must be pretty hungry

1185
01:18:09,242 --> 01:18:12,090
so enjoy your ddeokbokki
while we get your cars ready.

1186
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:16,869
[As promised, they finally get to
enjoy their ddeokbokki party.]

1187
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,960
[Along with the hardboiled eggs and
the sweet radish they just used.]

1188
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:32,131
[Enjoying the delicious snacks with
their partners and friends.]

1189
01:18:32,132 --> 01:18:37,857
[Enjoying a delicious snack with each other
is all part of the fun on a date.]

1190
01:18:38,603 --> 01:18:40,909
The cheese adds some richness to it.

1191
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,606
[Chapter Eleven- Unbreakable Love.]

1192
01:18:56,395 --> 01:18:59,538
[Final location.]

1193
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:04,755
Thank you to everyone for participating
in all the dating games today.

1194
01:19:07,006 --> 01:19:09,521
New love is budding everywhere.

1195
01:19:09,522 --> 01:19:14,498
Here are the rocks that have stood as your
symbol of strength of your love all day

1196
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:17,402
along with the egg that stood
as part of testimony to your love.

1197
01:19:17,403 --> 01:19:22,774
All these have been measured by
the Moh's Hardness Scale.

1198
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:24,572
Here's your final mission.

1199
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:27,188
It's the Rock Battle of Love.

1200
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:31,309
Each couple will have to smash their
rocks against the other team's rocks

1201
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:36,354
and the team who has the rock that still
remains unbroken to the end wins the race.

1202
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,106
So we smash it against others?

1203
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,717
Can you just throw our egg out?

1204
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:44,416
We thought we were being clever by
choosing to go with the egg.

1205
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:45,757
Gary chose to do that.

1206
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:50,038
First through third place winning teams will
be given a hint and an exchange coupon.

1207
01:19:52,732 --> 01:19:54,610
[Third place- Jong Kook and Yeon Soo.]

1208
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:57,536
[Will tell you which three teams has
the three of the weakest rocks.]

1209
01:19:58,453 --> 01:20:01,676
[Gary-Min Ah, Suk Jin-Choi Hee,
and Jae Suk-Se Yun.]

1210
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:04,064
- You have one chance to make an exchange.
- Just one?

1211
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,790
You have thirty seconds.

1212
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,894
I don't think it's this one.
It's way too shiny.

1213
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:12,695
I think you're right about this
one being hard.

1214
01:20:12,696 --> 01:20:14,938
- I think it could be this one too.
- Seriously?

1215
01:20:15,716 --> 01:20:19,613
[Contemplating between Kwang Soo-Narsha
and Ha Ha-Hye Jin's rocks.]

1216
01:20:20,301 --> 01:20:21,315
This one.

1217
01:20:28,826 --> 01:20:32,266
[Jong Kook and Se Yun swap
theirs out with Ha Ha and Hye Jin's.]

1218
01:20:33,776 --> 01:20:37,104
Wow, so this is what it looks like!

1219
01:20:38,815 --> 01:20:40,550
Take a good look.
Let's look through them all.

1220
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:43,499
[Fascinated by all the rocks
that they're seeing for the first time.]

1221
01:20:45,689 --> 01:20:49,557
[You can ask any one question,
and I will answer with a 'Yes' or a 'No'.]

1222
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:56,573
[Is our rock stronger than
Suk Jin and Choi Hee's rock?]

1223
01:20:57,547 --> 01:21:00,328
The rock that you have is weaker
than Suk Jin and Choi Hee's rock.

1224
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:04,782
I knew it.
I could tell that just from looking at it.

1225
01:21:05,857 --> 01:21:07,818
Okay, you do have a chance
to make a swap.

1226
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:12,420
It's either this one or that one.
It's one or the other.

1227
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:14,442
I'm pretty sure it's this one.

1228
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,350
We're going to swap it out for this one.

1229
01:21:20,446 --> 01:21:22,947
[Jae Suk and Se Yun swaps theirs out
for Ha Ha and Hye Jin's rock.]

1230
01:21:24,437 --> 01:21:26,644
- This is your final hint.
- We had no other choice.

1231
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:31,745
[Time for Suk Jin and Choi Hee's turn
to make their swap.]

1232
01:21:32,509 --> 01:21:36,808
[We will let you know which teams
have the four strongest rocks.]

1233
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:39,444
Listen carefully.

1234
01:21:39,445 --> 01:21:41,572
Here are the top four teams.

1235
01:21:41,573 --> 01:21:43,291
This is in no specific order.

1236
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:50,171
The teams are, Jong Kook-Yeon Soo,
Kwang Soo-Narsha, Jae Suk-Se Yun

1237
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:52,574
and finally, Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.

1238
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:54,569
So ours isn't one of them.

1239
01:21:56,228 --> 01:21:57,875
You have one chance to make a swap.

1240
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,500
Who were the teams again?

1241
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:04,547
[Must swap theirs out for one of the
four teams mentioned.]

1242
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,340
I think it's this one.

1243
01:22:10,088 --> 01:22:11,510
We've made our choice.

1244
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:15,502
[Suk Jin and Choi Hee swaps theirs out
for Jong Kook and Yeon Soo's rock.]

1245
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:24,257
[Final rock selection for all the couples.]

1246
01:22:24,258 --> 01:22:26,597
[Time for the Love Rock Battle to start!]

1247
01:22:26,598 --> 01:22:28,785
Okay, here's your first battle.

1248
01:22:28,786 --> 01:22:32,474
Gary and Min Ah vs Ha Ha and Han Hye Jin.

1249
01:22:33,341 --> 01:22:34,842
We'll for sure win this one.

1250
01:22:34,843 --> 01:22:38,242
Place one on the bottom and
smash down on the other from the top.

1251
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:40,462
We're going to win this.

1252
01:22:41,586 --> 01:22:44,755
We don't want all the egg yolk to splatter,
so we'll smash down on yours.

1253
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:47,658
Why are you so convinced that
this is actually an egg?

1254
01:22:47,659 --> 01:22:50,903
- I'm positive that it's an egg.
- One, two...

1255
01:22:50,904 --> 01:22:52,922
I doubt Running Man would be that simple.

1256
01:22:57,344 --> 01:22:59,476
Ugh, what are we going to do
with this now?

1257
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:02,647
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin wins.]

1258
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,580
Lee Kwang Soo and Narsha.

1259
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:09,450
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin vs Kwang Soo and Narsha.]

1260
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,242
Be careful of your hands.

1261
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:15,640
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin to go first.]

1262
01:23:19,267 --> 01:23:20,389
Okay!

1263
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,416
- We won this!
- That wasn't even a competition!

1264
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,737
[Kwang Soo and Narsha win.]

1265
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:32,904
- We just totally destroyed yours.
- What is this thing?

1266
01:23:32,905 --> 01:23:34,834
We turned yours into a pile of
powdered sugar.

1267
01:23:34,835 --> 01:23:38,946
Next up is Kim Jong Kook and Ha Yeon Soo.

1268
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,835
- I don't think that's going to do it.
- I thought that was going to be the hardest.

1269
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:46,057
Is that soap?
It smells really good.

1270
01:23:47,029 --> 01:23:48,428
Is it soap?

1271
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:53,650
Jong Kook can smash down even a boulder
with a bar of soap.

1272
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:56,371
- Please, please...
- I think Jong Kook will win this.

1273
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:58,236
I really want to beat Jong Kook!

1274
01:23:58,237 --> 01:24:01,423
Go ahead. I'm telling you
that Jong Kook has a good one.

1275
01:24:01,424 --> 01:24:02,995
I think I'm right.

1276
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:10,514
Okay, now the other way.
Lee Kwang Soo can smash his down.

1277
01:24:12,885 --> 01:24:15,709
What are you doing?
We have to have our turn now.

1278
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,606
You can't do that.

1279
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:21,486
[Two pieces]

1280
01:24:23,247 --> 01:24:27,158
[Kwang Soo and Narsha win!]

1281
01:24:27,861 --> 01:24:31,137
[Kwang Soo and Narsha must have
a very strong piece of rock.]

1282
01:24:31,138 --> 01:24:34,013
Ji Suk Jin and Choi Hee.

1283
01:24:34,014 --> 01:24:35,916
We're going already?
That doesn't sound right.

1284
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:38,839
- I thought Suk Jin would go last.
- That looks like it's from outer space.

1285
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,146
I don't know how this may end

1286
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:43,151
but if Lee Kwang Soo's rock remains in
that state, then he has the strongest rock.

1287
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:44,406
Is that understood?

1288
01:24:45,824 --> 01:24:48,558
[Suk Jin and Choi Hee to go first.]

1289
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,914
[Suk Jin and Choi Hee's rock
is shattered into pieces.]

1290
01:24:59,646 --> 01:25:03,474
[Kwang Soo and Narsha win.]

1291
01:25:05,128 --> 01:25:08,844
[Big-nose is not accepting his loss.]

1292
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:15,316
[Suk Jin and Choi Hee's rock is split in half,
and thus loses the battle.]

1293
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:17,366
Kwang Soo's rock must be the strongest.

1294
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:20,623
[Could Kwang Soo and Narsha really
have the strongest rock?]

1295
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,431
[Kwang Soo and Narsha
vs Ji Hyo and Seo Joon.]

1296
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,996
Ours isn't broken yet.

1297
01:25:33,358 --> 01:25:34,609
Okay!

1298
01:25:35,877 --> 01:25:37,997
[Ji Hyo and Seo Joon's rock
is also broken down in half.]

1299
01:25:39,828 --> 01:25:43,474
[Kwang Soo and Narsha's rock
beats four in a row.]

1300
01:25:43,475 --> 01:25:45,613
It's not that theirs is that strong,
but it's because of the large size.

1301
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:50,426
- Why does the size even matter?
- That's why it's breaking everything.

1302
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:54,036
[Kwang Soo and Narsha vs
Jae Suk and Se Yun.]

1303
01:25:56,057 --> 01:26:02,671
[It's time... for the final battle.]

1304
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:07,339
[The stronger of these two will be
the final winner of the day.]

1305
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,549
So if they beat us now,
then they win the whole race?

1306
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,442
The team with the unbroken rock
wins the whole race.

1307
01:26:12,443 --> 01:26:14,978
[This will determine who the
winner will be.]

1308
01:26:18,481 --> 01:26:23,617
[Please break... break...]

1309
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:33,512
[The winner is still undetermined.]

1310
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:36,349
This is not being broken.

1311
01:26:38,303 --> 01:26:40,642
This is just some dust falling off of it.

1312
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:42,882
- You need to really break it.
- They both must be really strong.

1313
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:45,269
Come on, just a little bit.

1314
01:26:46,278 --> 01:26:50,954
[Please... break!]

1315
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,881
[Kwang Soo and Narsha's rock
is shattered into pieces!]

1316
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:09,443
[Jae Suk and Se Yun win!]

1317
01:27:12,234 --> 01:27:14,071
Se Yun!
I can't believe we did it!

1318
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:16,608
- Se Yun!
- That's unbelievable.

1319
01:27:16,609 --> 01:27:18,413
I can't believe that even happened!

1320
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:23,358
[They win the whole race by swapping out their
rock with the one chance that they've had.]

1321
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:34,869
[The ultimate token of love...
a diamond ring.]

1322
01:27:36,993 --> 01:27:39,991
You're giving us this huge diamond ring?

1323
01:27:39,992 --> 01:27:42,414
It's a one carat diamond.

1324
01:27:42,415 --> 01:27:45,117
[The winning prize is a diamond ring.]

1325
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:47,697
- How much is that worth?
- That was our rock!

1326
01:27:49,461 --> 01:27:53,531
- That was our rock!
- I'm the luckiest one here today!

1327
01:27:59,763 --> 01:28:04,217
The strongest rock is the mineral
with elements of diamond in it.

1328
01:28:04,218 --> 01:28:09,052
But the rock you had was one step below
with elements of ruby in it.

1329
01:28:10,675 --> 01:28:15,885
One carat diamond ring!
