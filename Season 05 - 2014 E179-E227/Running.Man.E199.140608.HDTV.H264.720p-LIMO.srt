- What is that?
- You actually put that up there?

17
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,898

What are you doing?

35
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:29,094
- You really are something else.
- Why would you ask him about a diamond?

36
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,604
How many studs do you
have on the ring?

37
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:34,639
- He has once again returned to Running Man.
- He's a part of the RM family!

Can you say a word to our

41
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:44,923
It is that time of the year again
for me to return to the show.

42
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:47,931
Thanks for making me a semi-permanent
guest on the show, my name is Park Ji Sung.

he is now officially retired from the games.

46

I want to be his knees.
I want to be Park Ji Sung's knees.

47
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,678
But I don't want that.

48
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:09,931
[That's our MC Park!]

49
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,625

- Okay, I'll just use my own knees.

50

using his own knees.]

that Park Ji Sung is our guest for the day

following the tradition of 2012 and 2013

54
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:31,469
Running Man has been given the chance to
participate in the 2014 Dream Cup again.

55
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,535
Can we just not do that?

56
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:41,167
[The reason why Captain Park is
waving his hand in refusal is...]

57
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:44,497
[Running Man's shockingly bad performance
at the games last year and the year before.]

58
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:49,531
[Even Captain Park was shocked to see
how bad they played during the games.]

59
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:52,046
The past two years were embarrassing
enough that even Park Ji Sung

60
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:55,200
is hesitant to let you play
again this year.

61
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,385
- But we'll be much better this year.
- But Ji Sung knows us better now.

62
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,734
Now that he knows us better, I think he'll
choose the players differently this year.

63
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:05,048
- But that doesn't really mean much.
- He even grabbed Jong Kook by his collar.

64
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,944
[Kkuk showed that he's not very skilled in
soccer with his playing last year.]

65
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,725
- I couldn't see the goal without my glasses.
- Let's all just be honest here.

66
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,753
- Did anyone else try a heading shot?
- What did you say?

67
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,820
- You didn't do it either.
- You can't call what you did a heading shot.

68
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,622
[Not really much of a heading,
but more like a ball to the face shot.]

69
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:24,049
- Has anyone else kicked a penalty ball?
- You didn't even make the goal!

70
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,129
- You didn't even make the goal!
- Who cares when you didn't even make it!

71
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,762
[Jae Suk's golden opportunity to score
a point during last year's game.]

72
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:31,805
[But he didn't make the goal...]

73
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,089
You were 'Hollow Leg Yoo Jae Suk',
and 'Crap Ball Kim Jong Kook'.

74
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:38,236
Are they right, Ji Sung?
Was it really a bad kick?

75
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:43,193
Missing the penalty kick is purely
the fault of the player kicking the ball.

76
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,089
[Nice!]

77
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,210
He's saying this now after a whole year?
He knows how to hold a grudge.

78
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,795
So you've been holding that grudge
against me for the past year?

79
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,058
We will be preparing ourselves this year for
the Dream Cup game being held in Indonesia.

80
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:04,821
Today's mission is called, 'Boot Camp
Training Race' with Ji Sung in charge.

81

[Mission- Dream Cup Boot Camp Training.]

82
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:12,043
Today's mission will be a mixture of missions
from Running Man and from your captain.

83
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:16,288
[Separate Running Man missions,
and Captain missions.]

84
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,220
[Depending how whether or not they succeed
the Running Man mission...]

85
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,488
[the difficulty level of
the Captain's mission will vary.]

86
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:24,494
Also, depending on whether or not Ji Sung
succeeds the Captain's mission or not

87
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,306
you will be given a certificate that you'll
be able to use during the final mission.

88
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:33,842
In the event that Team Running Man wins
the final mission at the end of the day

89
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:40,666
the team will be given an extreme advantage
that can be utilized at the game in Indonesia.

90
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,764
We're not going to be given any psychic powers
on the soccer field or something, are we?

91
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,934
I can definitely use the Roll-Roll power.

92
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:53,522
[Flying through the air and move the goal post
at an international soccer game?]

93

<i>- What the heck is this!
- What are you doing!</i>

94
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,989
That would be an embarrassment
to the whole country.

95
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,997
- We can't do that.
- I'm not using any of those powers.

96
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,665
[I bet you're going to want to wear
a face hiding mask to do that...]

97
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't you think that we're going to need
someone else to help with the training?

98
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,545
- That's right, we had others come last year.
- How about Evra?

99
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:15,022
- Let's ask another legend to join us.
- That sounds good. Do you know someone?

100
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:18,056
- Why, do you know anyone?
- No, but just think about it.

101
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:22,247
- How about Cha Bum Geun?
- It would be amazing if Cha Bum Geun came.

102
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,554
- Isn't he a legend himself?
- Yes, he's totally a legend.

103

[If they can only get the soccer legend and
SBS sports commentator, Cha Bum Geun...]

[Kkuk knows Cha Bum Geun's wife,
Oh Eun Mi's number...]

106
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,496
- How about we try some real tough training?
- What do you mean, try?

107
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,273
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- Why don't you try giving him a call?

108
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,035
It would be awesome if he came
because he's the best forward ever!

109
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,516
He and Ji Sung would be amazing together.

110
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:46,385
[Calling Cha Bum Geun's wife.]

111
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,973

after initiating the call.]

- Hi!

00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,001

114
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:57,091
Yes, hello...
This is Park Ji Sung.

115
00:06:57,092 --> 00:07:00,654
<i>Okay, hang on a second.
Coach Cha is doing something right now.</i>

116
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,005
- Hang on just a moment.
- Yes, of course.

117
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:05,218
- She must be with him right now.
- I can't believe she answered!

118
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,687
Maybe Coach Cha is filming something.

119

- Hello, this is Park Ji Sung.

122
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:15,446
- 'Oh, okay. Hi.'
- Hello, Sir.

123
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,541
<i>That was a lot of great work
you did all these years.</i>

124
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:22,959
Yes, thank you for your kind words.
I'm actually on the set of RM right now.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,049
Sports Commentator Cha Bum Geun,
I love you!

126
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,780
I have nothing but the utmost
respect for you!

127
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:31,441
- Where are you filming right now?
- We're filming in Samahmdong right now.

128
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,451
- 'Samahmdong?'
- Yes, Sir.

129
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:38,113
- 'I'm doing something in Ilsan right now.'
- He's right by us.

130
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,094
Ask him if he's free at all today.

131
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:44,283
Coach Cha, we were wondering if you're
free at all later on today?

132
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:46,238
I've never seen you acting
so nervous before.

133
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,471
- 'Why?'
- Tell him why we want him here.

134
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,355
It's just that Running Man members are
such poor soccer players...

135
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,644
so I was hoping that you could come and...

136
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,842
- 'You're asking me to coach them?'
- Yes, Sir.

137
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,944
- Please help us, Coach Cha.
- We love you, Coach Cha.

138
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,098
<i>It's been a while since
I've quit coaching anyone.</i>

139
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,914
But there's no one else I know who could
even begin to help these guys unless it's you.

140
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:10,472
- We're total newbies.
- You're a legend to our country!

141
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,341
Please come and help us!

142
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,275
<i>Okay then.</i>

143
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,793
Is he really coming?

144

- I was just thinking that you could...
- He's really hesitating right now.

152
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,314
- Why are you hesitating so much?
- You really seem to be hesitating.

[Can't help but laugh at the sudden request.]

154
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,660

00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,715
I think he said okay.

159
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:33,585
- Tell him that you'll do it.
- Okay.

160
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:37,089
[Coach Cha agrees!]

161
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,025
- 'Once I finish up here...'
- Okay.

162
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:43,548
- 'I'll see you then.'
- Yes, thank you.

163
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,455
[We'll be waiting for you!]

164
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,288
But we're not sure if
he'll really come or not, right?

165
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,256
- He says he's in Samahmdong right now.
- That's really close.

166
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:57,174
I'll stop by there when I'm done here.

167
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:04,726
We have prepared your first mission to
determine who you'll be teamed up with.

168
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,472
- Yes, let's get started.
- Let's go!

169

[Dream Cup Boot Camp Training- Start!]

170

[Will the near hopelessness of RM's
soccer skills be improved in one day?]

171
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,270
<i>- Ji Sung's getting married in July.
- That's right around the corner.</i>

172
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:24,073
I bet your fiancée is really accommodating
to you right now, isn't she?

173
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,892
Yes, of course.

174
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,353
- Yes, I'm sure she is.
- I hope that she'll stay that way.

175
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:33,498
[The married men club's
unanimous understanding.]

176
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,999
- Do you want a daughter or a son?
- It doesn't matter to me at all.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,109
[Captain Park doesn't care if
they have a boy or a girl in the future.]

178
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,052
- If your son wants to be a soccer player?
- He should be encouraged.

179
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,648
If that's what my son wants,
then I'll encourage it.

180
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,863
- What if your daughter wants it?
- Then I'll encourage her too.

181
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:48,129
[Captain Park will encourage whatever
his children will want to pursue.]

182
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,887
- You're a very open-minded dad.
- Ji Sung will be a supportive dad.

183
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,617
His children will be capable of doing anything
with Park Ji Sung as their father.

184
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,321
- What if your son wants to be an MC?
- Then I'll tell him to rethink his decision.

185
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,608
- You're so stifling.
- You're a strict dad.

186
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,240
- He's already pretty strict.
- He's the boss of his family.

187
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,819
What if Hyun Woo says he wants to
become a Ddakji King?

188
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,472
As long as he can make money
from doing it.

189
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,610
But that wouldn't really earn him
any money.

190

[Boot Camp Training- Course one.

191

192
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:30,226
[What is that?]

193
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:33,768
They're training uniforms.

[Nervous energy...]

195
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,895
Are they drawstring pants?

196
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,568
[With the exception of the captain,
everyone else is changed into their uniforms.]

197
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,598
- You look so funny right now.
- I didn't know we'd have to wear this.

198
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,806
Gary's legs are too long for his pants.

199
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:53,465
[Drawstring fashionista.]

200
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:56,445
- Can't you warn us of things like this first?
- How far do we pull up these pants?

201
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,381
[Kwang Soo's first time ever
in a pair of drawstring pants!]

202
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:01,953
- Okay, here's your mission.
- What kind of a mission is it?

203
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,068
In order to train your mentality to avoid
getting flustered no matter what happens...

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,528
we are going to be playing,
Drawstring Telepathy Game.

205
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,494
Running Man members will disperse
separately on their own

206
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,392
to successfully complete each of the missions
on their own and come back to this spot.

207
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,444
There will be a time limit to
complete these missions.

208
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:22,271
While you're each completing
missions of your own

209
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:24,033
Park Ji Sung will be doing
a mission of his own right here.

210
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,489
But no matter how well you're doing
at your own mission

211
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,618
as soon as Park Ji Sung fails the mission
that he'll be doing on his own

212
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,312
then everyone as a whole
will fail the mission.

213
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,430
[Everyone must return to the starting line
before Captain Park completes his mission.]

214
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:33,986
- You have to make sure to do well.
- This is our first game.

215
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,234
Don't mess this up for us.

216
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,734
You will get a total of five chances

217
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:41,160
and if you succeed just even once,
then the mission is successfully completed.

218
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,245
[Successfully complete the mission within
five chances to pass the mission.]

219
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:48,974
[Captain missions' level of difficulty will vary
depending on the success of RM missions.]

220
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:52,238
Everyone understand the rules?
Then we will now start the missions.

221
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,982
- So it's an individual mission?
- Do a good job, Ji Sung.

222
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,976
[Everyone to their positions.]

223
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,271
So the members don't know what kind
of a mission I'll be doing?

224
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,151
This is making me feel nervous.

[Drawstring Army set - in position!]

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:11,735

in midair right now?

mission the members will be performing.]

229

While Park Ji Sung carries out his mission

230
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,232
each of the seven members must find costumes
of seven different colors

231
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,519
and come back to the starting point
dressed in the borrowed costumes.

232
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:40,237
- So no one can be in the same color?
- Yes, that's correct.

233
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:44,356
Here's the mission that you'll have to
carry out in the meantime.

234
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:48,002
You have to do the beanie toss (hacky sack)
without dropping the beanie on the ground.

235
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:50,361
[Hacky sack until all the members
make it back to the starting point.]

236
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:57,306
If you drop the beanie on the ground,
then everyone fails the mission.

237
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,280
- Do you understand?
- Can I catch it with my hand?

238
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,390
You will have two chances to
catch it with your hand.

239
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,393
I've never played hacky sack before.

240
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,215
Can I have a practice round first?

241
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,807
This is a really nice gym.

to the Drawstring Army.]

244

from other people?

[All seven members must borrow costumes
of different colors from other people.]

246
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,315
Can it be just any type of clothing?

247
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,704
We don't have to lend our clothes
out to those people, right?

248
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:33,338
We will now start
Captain Park Ji Sung's mission.

Look at all the clothes in the gym here.

255
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,782
I should choose a color that most people
don't usually wear often.

[Concentrate]

257

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,521
Wow, Ji Sung.
You're really good!

Park Ji Sung!
Okay, I'm leaving.

267
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,683
- You have to get back to hacky sack.
- What color can I find?

268
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,529
You've used up one of your two chances
to catch it in your hand.

269
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,578
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't talk to me!

270

I'm sorry, Ji Sung. Hurry back!

- What's so hard about this?
- What did you just do!

294
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:16,960
It's not his fault.
We just took too long.

I have to keep kicking the beanie
until everyone makes it back here.

- Until everyone makes it back.
- You have to keep kicking it?

297
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:24,512
- You can't drop it at all?
- Until everyone makes it back here.

298
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:25,944
He had two chances to catch the beanie.

299
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,290

to interrupt me the first time...

- What happened?
- We failed the first round.

302

- We failed?
- Yes, we failed.

[Everyone's acting so cocky
after having taken their sweet old time.]

305

- I was in the gym.
- You got that from the gym?

[That's our Drawstring Fashionista!]

307
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,871
- Where did you even find that?
- Where were you?

308
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,109
I found this.

309
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,739
I could've accepted everyone's colors since
they were all different in style and color.

310
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,348
- But since the Captain failed his mission...
- Ji Sung!

311
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,602
- Can't you do better?
- You have to do a better job.

312
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:11,391
Hey, this is all your fault!

00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:13,474
Come on, Ji Sung, let's concentrate.

314

I'm telling you that it isn't my fault.
Wow, seriously.

- Let's all work better.
- You need to work faster.

316

- We're just starting out.
- Don't forget this.

317
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,945
Don't forget the fact that I get to decide
who gets to play in the World Cup.

318
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,116
I was just joking, Ji Sung.

319
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,154
Yes, we know how difficult
this must be for you.

320
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:33,944
We did pretty well in the first round,
and I know that we can do this.

321
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,815
[Second attempt-
Everyone back to their positions.]

322
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,235
Hey, Park Ji Sung.

323
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,402
Let's get it done this time.

324
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,873
Okay, let's get it done.

325
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:49,163
[What will their mission be this time?]

326
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,261
While Park Ji Sung carries out his mission

327
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,934
<i>While Park Ji Sung carries out his mission...</i>

328
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:57,671
<i>You have to go find an item that starts with
these two characters and return to the line.</i>

329
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:03,355
<i>Find these items and get back to
your starting point on the first floor.</i>

330
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,018
- Okay, those two characters?
- Yes.

331
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,824
<i>All seven members must each bring back
a different item in order to succeed.</i>

332
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,434
What could I get?

333
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:12,727
[They all must be different items.]

334
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:15,012
<i>Here's your mission.</i>

335
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,013
<i>It's jump roping.</i>

336
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:23,448
<i>If you trip and fall before all the members
return, then you fail the mission.</i>

337
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,269
<i>We will let you choose which jump rope
you'd like to use. </i>

338
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,783
<i>We have two different ones.</i>

339
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,967
[Compares the two different jump ropes.]

340
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,544
I'll go with this one.

341
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,531
When's the last time you've
jump roped?

342
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,002
Middle school, I think.

343
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,933
I haven't jump roped since
I was in middle school.

344
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,391
<i>Okay, Park Ji Sung,
you may start your mission.</i>

345
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,252
What are some items that start
with those two characters?

346
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,837
A hat!
I've got a hat!

347
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:04,068
[Blank Ji is the first to arrive
with a hat as her item.]

348
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:07,406
Just a little bit longer.

349
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,372
What the heck?
Did you bring back a hat?

350
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:11,858
- Yeah, I have the hat.
- Darn!

351
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,582
- Hey, what did you bring back?
- A hat!

352
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,784
No, you can't be tired yet.

353
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:26,613
I'm sorry, but can you lend me
a water glass?

354
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,139
I'll bring it right back.

355
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,211
A water glass!

356
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:32,195
[But this guy is also going
after a water glass...]

357
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,413
By any chance, is there anyone here
by the name of, Myung Ja?

358
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,918
Is there a Myung Ja here?

359
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,477
- Mi Joo?
- No, it's not.

360
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,527
That's not your name?
A beer!

361
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,884
Thank you!

362
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,474
But where am I going to get a beer?

363
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,332
Concentrate.

364
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,627
- Ugh, I'm starting to get really tired.
- No, you can't.

365
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,504
You can't get tired.

366
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:54,251
A hat... what else is there
besides a hat?

367
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:57,638
Dust?
There's a lot of dust around here.

368
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,044
How about a marker?
Do you have a magic marker?

369
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:05,051
- What's taking everyone so long?
- Come on, hurry!

370
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,235
- Water glass. I got water glass.
- Water glass!

371
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,133
Get out of his way.

372
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,207
[Oxygen tank, Park Ji Sung,
is still going even after all this time!]

373
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,996
- What's taking everyone so long?
- I'm here!

374
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:15,281
- I got it!
- What did you bring back?

375
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:17,137
[What? He brought back a person?]

376
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,049
[Just then...]

377
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,904
[Oh... my... God...]

378
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,043
[Park Ji Sung fails the mission.]

379
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,444
- No!
- A magic marker!

380
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:35,284
I have a magic marker!

381
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:38,497
[How can this be...]

382
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,219
- You couldn't even do that?
- Jump roping is easy.

383
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,203
[Ah, I feel so alone...]

384
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,385
Foot fungus.
He says he has foot fungus.

385
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:50,572
- I'm serious! That's what he said.
- But still! Foot fungus?

386
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:53,031
- Foot fungus starts with those characters.
- What are you thinking?

387
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,016
He really said he has foot fungus.
I'm so sorry for this.

388
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:57,751
I'm sorry for asking this,
but do you by any chance have foot fungus?

389
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,270
- Do you have foot fungus?
- Yes, I do.

390
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,008
Can you come with me for a moment?

391
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,875
Thank you.
Thank you so much!

392
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,725
Come on!
We need to hurry!

393
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,558
Thank you so much.

394
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,547
Would you have had to confirm
that he really has foot fungus?

395
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:14,792
- We failed the mission anyway.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,174
- Thank you though.
- Here comes Gary.

397
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,278
- What is it?
- What did you bring back, Gary?

398
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,614
Blank Ji!

399
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,340
[Only thing Gary sees that begin with
those characters is, Blank Ji.]

400
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,698
- I couldn't think of anything else.
- There are ton of stuff like this beer.

401
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,038
But the real problem here is that
Ji Sung keeps failing his missions.

402
00:22:29,507 --> 00:22:32,334
[Blaming everything on the Captain?]

403
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,460
When I saw him jump roping,
I thought we were going to succeed for sure.

404
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:37,007
- I haven't jump roped since middle school.
- Seriously?

405
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,704
You should've done it more.

406
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:43,072
[As expected, Big-nose doesn't care about
mincing his words even to a living legend.]

407
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,861
Are you being all harsh to Ji Sung
now that he's retired from the game?

408
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:48,736
You know that Ji Sung will be the one
to pick who gets to play at the game, right?

409
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,527
Okay, we will now start your third
out of five chances to pull off this mission.

410
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:55,640
- Everyone back to your positions.
- Do better this time, Ji Sung.

411
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,551
- Okay, let's get this done.
- Fighting!

412
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,696
I feel like the missions are
getting easier though.

413
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:03,612
[They all seem to be pretty comfortable
in their drawstring uniforms now.]

414
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,830
- Good luck, Ji Sung.
- Choose your mission.

415
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:09,624
[The next mission for the members is...]

416
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:13,649
While Park Ji Sung carries out his mission

417
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,859
seven RM members must bring someone back
from each of the different age groups.

418
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,179
<i>Bring someone back
from each of the different age groups.</i>

419
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,859
[Example- Teens, 20s, 30s... etc.]

420
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,917
- Yes, of each different age groups.
- Okay, I got it.

421
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,919
I wonder how I need to do it
so it's different than anyone else's.

422
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,370
<i>Your next personal mission is...</i>

423
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,301
<i>to use your whole body to bounce a ball
without ever dropping it on the ground.</i>

424
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:40,049
<i>If the ball even grazes the ground,
then you fail the mission.</i>

425
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:43,946
<i>Okay, here's your ball.
You have to bounce it around.</i>

426
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,714
[Carefully compares the two balls again.]

427
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,710
If I fail this too...

428
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,766
Then we'll be in big trouble.

429
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:58,088
Ready, set, go!

430
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:01,180
[Drawstring telepathy- Go!]

431
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,029
Ma'am!

432
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,756
Ma'am, how old are you?

433
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:11,109
Excuse me, but can I take the baby?
I mean, can you and the baby come with me?

434
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,678
Yes, please come with me.

435
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:22,617
Excuse me,
but can you please keep it down?

436
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,340
How old are you?
Twelve? Okay, come with me.

437
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,474
- Come on, hurry!
- How old are you?

438
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,370
- I feel so nervous.
- Your baby is eleven months old?

439
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,040
- This baby is eleven months old.
- He's twelve years old.

440
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:38,180
Hello.

441
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,796
Ma'am, who's the oldest person
in this room?

442
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:43,052
- She's in her sixties.
- In her sixties?

443
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,925
- She's in her sixties.
- Where? Where is she?

444
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,456
[Big-nose is trying to convince a
coffee shop worker to come with him.]

445
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:49,099
How old are you?

446
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:53,068
[Mr. Gary chooses
a foreigner in her twenties.]

447
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:54,575
She's in her twenties!

448
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:58,471
[Steady and confident ball bouncing.]

449
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:00,610
[That's our Park Ji Sung!]

450
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:01,933
She's in her twenties!

451
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:05,102
Ji Young!

452
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:08,438
[Wait, that's...]

453
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:13,378
[The Queen of Ballads, Baek Ji Young.]

454
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,104
[Catch Baek Ji Young!]

455
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:18,162
- What?
- Come with me.

456
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,340
[A chance run-in with Ji Young, who
was waiting for the radio show to start.]

457
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:23,680
- You're in your late thirties, right?
- Yes.

458
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,745
- She's in her twenties.
- What?

459
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,123
She's in her twenties, so you have to go back.

460
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:32,650
[Double of twenties.]

461
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,892
- Mrs. Baek.
- Aren't you in your forties yet?

462
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,449
I've still got another year to go for that.

463
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,106
[Over five minutes have passed.
Park Ji Sung's skills are amazing!]

464
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,813
Is there anyone here who is
in their forties?

465
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,379
[The remaining members must now bring
someone back over the age of 40.]

466
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,206
- Anyone in their twenties here?
- Yes, there is.

467
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:54,036
- How about in their thirties?
- Go get someone in their fifties!

468
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:58,245
- Go back and get someone!
- We already have someone in their 30s here.

469
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,461
Director, I need you to
help me out for a minute.

470
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:02,472
You're the oldest one here right now.

471
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,586
Help me out for a minute.

472
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,765
[Then who's going to film the show?]

473
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:12,357
[Captain Park is slowly
starting to feel the fatigue.]

474
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,240
- Who is that?
- She's not a celebrity.

475
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,082
Why does that guy keep kicking the ball?
Wait, is that Park Ji Sung?

476
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,242
[Ji Young finally recognizes Park Ji Sung.]

477
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:24,315
- I just need you for three minutes.
- Is there anyone in their fifties here?

478
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:27,574
- She needs to get back to work.
- How old are you?

479
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:29,218
- I'm in my sixties.
- She's in her sixties.

480
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,422
We've verified her age,
so she can go back to work.

481
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,088
[Kkuk's guest in her sixties rushes back
to work after having her age verified.]

482
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:35,358
Get someone in their fifties!

483
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:38,822
[Eight minutes have now passed.]

484
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,135
[They'll succeed the mission if Kwang Soo
can bring back someone in their fifties.]

485
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,244
[They just need to verify
everyone's age now.]

486
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:52,223
[What?
You mean it wasn't over yet?]

487
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:58,404
[Will they fail the mission?]

488
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:02,968
[He saves the ball!]

489
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:07,312
[What amazing talent!
So dangerously close to having lost it!]

490
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:13,508
- He's eleven months old!
- He's in his teens!

491
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,492
- Who's in their twenties?
- She's in her twenties!

492
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:18,499
- Thirties over here!
- he's in his forties.

493
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,158
- Fifties here.
- The grandmother earlier was in her sixties.

494
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,272
- Is he in his fifties?
- You're in your fifties, right?

495
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,051
No, I'm in my sixties.

496
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,452
<i>No, I'm in my sixties.</i>

497
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,864
[Kwang Soo!]

498
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:35,406
Hold on just a little bit longer, Ji Sung!

499
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,358
[Will Captain Park Ji Sung be able to
hold out much longer?]

500
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:42,296
[Find a guest in their fifties!]

501
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:44,899
[Another dangerous moment!]

502
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,592
Oh no!

503
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:49,792
[The Queen of Ballads freaks out!]

504
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,822
Ji Young is freaking out over here.

505
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:58,134
[Drawstring Kwang Soo must find
someone in their fifties!]

506
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,191
- I'm over fifty years old.
- Really?

507
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,106
Then can you come with me for a moment?

508
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,709
[Now past the ten minute mark!]

509
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,135
[Even though he may be Captain Park,
even he has his limits...]

510
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:11,121
I'm on my way!
Wait just a little bit longer!

511
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:15,610
I've got sweat in my eyes,
and I can't even see the ball right now.

512
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:23,130
[Will he be able to stick it out...
or will he flail down to the ground?]

513
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:27,737
- Here he comes!
- Just hold on a bit longer.

514
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,519
- Just a little bit longer.
- Hold on, Ji Sung.

515
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:37,124
[Will Kwang Soo touch ground first...
or will the ball touch ground first?]

516
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,461
[Captain Park!
Just a little bit longer...]

517
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,213
- Eleven months!
- Teens!

518
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,265
- Twenties!
- Thirties!

519
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:52,655
- Forties!
- Fifties!

520
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:54,205
The grandmother from earlier
was in her sixties.

521
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:05,156
[Mission success!]

522
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,704
Thank you!

523
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:21,813
[Thank you to all those who participated
in helping out our Drawstring Army.]

524
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,625
Thank you.

525
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:31,694
[Thank you to Baek Ji Young for joining us
even with the radio show looming ahead.]

526
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:33,470
- Bye!
- I'll see you later.

527
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,995
- You have a new song out?
- It's titled, 'Still hot as ever'.

528
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,157
- Tell the viewers about your new song.
- 'Still hot as ever' is now out.

529
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,194
[Makes her exit after briefly
promoting her new song.]

530
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:45,687
[Captain Park kept up the bouncing
of the ball for over ten minutes!]

531
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,785
[The amazing Park Ji Sung!]

532
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,239
I thought that I had it the first time.

533
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,662
<i>Because all of you succeeded
this mission</i>

534
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:59,983
<i>the difficulty level of the Captain's missions
have now been lowered.</i>

535
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,403
<i>If you succeed the next mission</i>

536
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:06,135
<i>you will be given a great advantage which
you will be able to use at your final mission.</i>

537
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:11,721
[Mission One- Mental Reinforcement Training.
Success!]

538
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,474
<i>I will now reveal your next mission.</i>

539
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:17,281
[Time to reveal the Captain's mission.]

540
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:19,458
Does he have to pull the car
with the rest of us in it?

541
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:23,740
- But this is supposed to be an easy mission.
- This is something that I should be doing.

542
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,470
Captain's mission.

543
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:29,564
Shoot the ball through the car window.

544
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:31,612
You're saying this is the easy mission?

545
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,269
Then what's the hard mission?

546
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,485
<i>If Park Ji Sung succeeds this mission</i>

547
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:37,031
<i>then you will be given a huge advantage
which will be of great use at the final mission.</i>

548
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,094
<i>The difficult mission you almost had was</i>

549
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:42,074
<i>you would've had to kick the ball
through the window</i>

550
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:44,808
<i>and make it come out through
the window on the other side.</i>

551
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,569
- Thank you.
- This is definitely easier.

552
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,511
The way I see it,
today's your boot camp training day.

553
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,991
The way I see it, I don't think this is bad,
and you should be able to do it all.

554
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,369
There are no practice shots.

555
00:30:57,952 --> 00:30:59,824
This isn't even a soccer field,
and I don't even have soccer shoes on.

556
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,512
You have to say whether you're going to put it
through the front or the back window.

557
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:05,631
- That's going over the line.
- Please decide which window you want.

558
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,596
- I think the front window will be better.
- I'll kick it through the front.

559
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:09,008
The front window?
Okay, I understand.

560
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:12,871
[Then it's time to roll up the back window.]

561
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,295
But he could've been aiming for the front,
and had it end up going through the back.

562
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,484
- Okay, we're ready.
- Let's do this.

563
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:19,456
He doesn't even have soccer shoes on,
so this may be tough.

564
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,598
- Park Ji Sung, fighting!
- Fighting.

565
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:24,378
I have no strength left in my legs.

566
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:27,817
[He only has three chances to
shoot the ball through the front window.]

567
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:30,239
Challenge.

568
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,429
[Even after 20 years of playing pro soccer,
this is the first experience of its kind.]

569
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,819
Challenge.

570
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,633
This is making me feel really nervous.

571
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:46,041
[First attempt]

572
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,787
[The ball is directed perfectly!]

573
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:05,164
[Will it make the goal?]

574
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:18,667
[A clean goal without any hesitation.]

575
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:27,532
[Celebrating along to
Park Ji Sung's official cheer song.]

576
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,418
He's still got it.

577
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,195
- How did he do that?
- That's just unbelievable.

578
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:37,180
Then can we have the Captain come
forward and accept the certificate?

579
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,760
[Thanks to Captain Park Ji Sung,
the team wins the special certificate.]

580
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,280
- Would you like to try the difficult one?
- No thanks.

581
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,706
Seriously, Park Ji Sung.
That was amazing.

582
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:48,702
- Can I open this?
- Yes, you may open it.

583
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,333
- That was a clean shot.
- What is it?

584
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,183
A chance certificate?

585
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,627
This is going to be
advantageous for us, isn't it?

586
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:59,533
We will now head off to your second mission,
Crisis Management Training location.

587
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:01,888
[Dream Cup- Boot camp Training.
Crisis Management Training.]

588

[Headed off to somewhere quite remote...]

589
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,411
I'm getting a weird feeling about this.
We're going off to a very rural area.

590
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:13,458
- They're not going to...
- What do you think this is going to be about?

591
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:17,695
If we're to be honest, other than the farmers
who actually work the fields or marshes

592
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,415
we probably go in those places
more than anyone else we know.

593
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:23,112
- I see a goal post over there.
- What?

594
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:24,313
What's that?

595
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,789
[Boot camp Training Mission Two-
Crisis Management Training.]

596
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,759
[Specially built soccer field
on the farm field.]

597
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,496
I'm sure the goal post is for us
to shoot the ball through, right?

598
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,128
What is all this?

599
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:43,104
This is a soccer field.

600
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,265
This isn't a soccer field,
this is a farm field.

601
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:47,357
It may look like a farm field,
but it's actually a soccer field.

602
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:49,562
Who's that?

603
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:53,516
[Top world soccer stars are aligned
alongside the soccer field.]

604
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,906
Look at all those stars.

605
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:59,108
- Wow, I can't believe all this.
- Wow.

606
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:00,924
Kwang Soo is the water boy.

607
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:03,828
If anyone needs any water, just let me know.

608
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:08,177
This mission is to help you train
for crisis management.

609
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:13,663
For this mission, Captain Park Ji Sung
will also be participating with you.

610
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:16,022
[Captain Park Ji Sung to participate
along with the rest of the members.]

611
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,870
<i>If you look on the field</i>

612
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:23,324
<i>R1 will drop the ball on the blue 'R' mark
in the middle of the field</i>

613
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:26,870
<i>then R2 will dribble the ball down the field
with their arms held out to the side</i>

614
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,448
<i>and zig zag through all the star players
as quickly as they can.</i>

615
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,850
- Ji Sung has to do that.
- Yeah, Ji Sung has to do that.

616
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,077
Yeah, that will be Ji Sung's job.

617
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:36,702
<i>You will use the soccer ball as your baton.</i>

618
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:38,557
<i>Once you get through the player course</i>

619
00:34:38,558 --> 00:34:40,284
<i>you will then throw
the water balloon with your foot.</i>

620
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:43,947
That's going to be tough.

621
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,576
Even if the balloon pops, as long as it makes
it into the basket, we'll count it as good.

622
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:52,166
Then the person with the balloon basket
will dribble the ball over to R5.

623
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:58,364
Then the scarecrow in R5 position will lean
to the side to fill up the water bottle.

624
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,175
[Fill up the water bottle while
standing in a scarecrow stance.]

625

- That would be perfect for Kwang Soo.
- That's Kwang Soo all the way.

626
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:08,405
Then the person in R6 position
will get doused with the water

627
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,815
will ceremoniously bring the ball
to the person in R7 position.

628
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:19,952
Then the final person at the goal post
will use their feet to catch the ball.

629
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,934
[Five chances to complete the mission-
90 second time limit.]

630

[An unbelievably difficult mission.]

631
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:30,053
If you fail somewhere along the mission,
then you will have to start over.

632
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:33,466
If you succeed the mission, then
the Captain will have an easier mission.

633
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:36,948
- Ji Sung will dribble through the obstacle.
- Yeah, Ji Sung will do that.

634
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:39,533
- Should I do this one?
- Yeah, you do that one.

635
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,627
But my shoulder aches.

636
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,779
[Kwang Soo is chosen to do
the scarecrow portion.]

637

[Captain Park's first scarecrow experience.]

638
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,844
You look really funny with that thing on.

639
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:58,274
- You think it's funny too?
- Yeah, it's funny to me too.

640
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,672
So I just dribble the ball
through this course?

641
00:36:02,922 --> 00:36:06,889
[Captain Park's practice dribble.]

642
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,374
I just need to do it like this.

643
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,145
I'll be fine doing it like this.

644
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:29,892
- Ready!
- This is really high up.

645
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:32,115
- Fighting!
- We can do this!

646
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:36,616
[Fighting!
We can do this!]

647
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,061
Fighting!

648
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:45,385
[Crisis Management Training- First attempt.]

649
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,759
Wow, this is really fast!

650
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,608
[R1 must drop the ball precisely
on the 'R' mark.]

651
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,616
[Successfully drops the ball.]

652
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,478
[Returned to original starting position
in preparation for second attempt.]

653
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:15,351
[In a scarecrow stance
on top of the uneven farm field...]

654
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:18,256
[But he still dribbles the ball
at an amazing speed.]

655
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:19,943
- Here he comes.
- Okay, good.

656
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:23,527
[Arrives at R3 in no time at all.]

657
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,416
Okay, throw it.

658
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:29,955
[Throw the ball with the foot
into the basket in R4's head.]

659
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:38,045
[Succeeds at first attempt!]

660
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,660
Hurry!

661
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,536
- Good! You caught it!
- Hurry!

662
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,488
What am I supposed to do?
What do I do now?

663
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:47,147
The ball!
Bring the ball over to me!

664
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:50,431
[Dribble the ball down to R5 with
the basket on his head.]

665
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:53,507
Pass it over to me.

666
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,707
[Fill the cup with water while
remaining in the scarecrow stance.]

667
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,391
Kwang Soo,
you're pouring it all over your face.

668
00:38:03,392 --> 00:38:05,543
You're just pouring it on your face.

669
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:09,760
[Is he doing the mission,
or is he just washing his hair?]

670
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:13,784
- Stop pouring it on your face.
- Get your face out of the way.

671
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,469
Hurry up!

672
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:18,328
- Get your face out of the way.
- To where?

673
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,184
- You have to move your face out of the way.
- Hurry up!

674
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:24,744
- There you go.
- You got it! Hurry over to me!

675
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:27,019
[Scarecrow water pour.]

676
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,023
He wasted all our time.

677
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:36,993
[Finally manages to fill the cup...
But time over!]

678
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,482
We can definitely do this.

679
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,888
- You have to lean your face away.
- Try it again.

680
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,879
Instead of you looking where you're pouring,
Ji Hyo should just tell you where to pour.

681
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,572
Try doing it with your head lifted away.

682
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:57,601
[Even with his head lifted,
he still gets soaked...]

683
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:01,272
[Even with his head bent,
he still gets soaked...]

684
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:04,542
- Kwang Soo can't do it right.
- Then how else am I supposed to do it?

685
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:08,623
- Why can't you do it, stupid?
- How many times am I washing my hair?

686
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:13,233
- Ji Sung, switch spots with me.
- No, I don't want to do that.

687
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:15,818
No, you do it.

688
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,129
- No, you do it.
- Yeah, you just do it.

689
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,949
What did I ever do wrong!

690
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:22,425
Come on, Ji Sung!
Switch with me!

691
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,762
Just look at the state I'm in right now!

692
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,322
[Kwang-crow explodes after his shower.]

693
00:39:28,684 --> 00:39:31,415
Come on, switch with me!
Are you not listening to me?

694
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:32,784
[Kkuk swaps positions with Captain Park,
and practices his dribbling.]

695
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:34,311
[This isn't too bad.]

696
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:37,083
- Okay, let's do this!
- We can do this!

697
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,741
- Yes, we can do this!
- Let's get this done!

698
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,643
Let's think of this as our one last chance!

699
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,603
Kwang Soo, you and I have to
work together on this.

700
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:45,224
- I'll show you how it's done.
- Okay.

701
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,560
Tell me when to stop.

702
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:52,541
[Second attempt- Start.]

703
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,823
Drop it!

704
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,620
You got it!

705
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,757
[Ji Hyo drops the ball precisely
in the center of the 'R' mark.]

706
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:08,149
[Ji Sung, take a good look at
the Tiger's dribble skills.]

707
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:11,742
Where are you going!

708
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:18,682
- What are you doing?
- What's he doing!

709
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,450
Jong Kook!

710
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:24,819
Kim Jong Kook!

711
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:30,795
[Brawling with the life-sized boards.]

712
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:35,134
[Gary and Suk Jin combo who previously
succeeded their attempt on the first try.]

713
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,573
Once you're ready,
then just throw it to me.

714
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:44,187
[Succeeds on their first try
for the second time in a row.]

715
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:45,975
The ball!

716
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,453
[The water bomb explodes in the basket
on top of his head.]

717
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:55,484
[Finally arrives at their biggest hurdle, R5.]

718
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,968
What's wrong with you?
Are your arms too short?

719
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:02,712
[Nice plan! Spit the water out
from his mouth into the cup.]

720
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:13,135
[Giraffe speeds up the process,
and quickly succeeds the mission!]

721
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,631
I'm going to throw this in your face.

722
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:20,855
[Jae Suk gets hit in the face with the water
that Giraffe had spit out from his mouth.]

723
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,082
[Runs over to Ji Sung in R7 to
do the goal ceremony with him.]

724
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,386
We're doing great on time!

725
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,640
[R8 must catch the penalty kick ball
with his feet.]

726
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,501
[Checks and locks in the goal...]

727
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,836
[The ball is kicked
directly in Ha Ha's path...]

728
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:51,248
[He just needs to catch the ball
with his feet!]

729
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,321
[So close, yet fails the mission.]

730
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,787
[20 seconds still left on the clock!]

731
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:06,517
You should've kicked it harder.

732
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,638
Okay, I got it.

733
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,453
- We're out of time anyways.
- Let's try it though.

734
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:17,881
[Tiger's awkward dribbling-
The Tiger Butterfly's dance.]

735
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:25,720
- Kim Soccer!
- What? I got it done quickly!

736
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,018
- What are you doing over there?
- I made good time!

737
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,934
- How was that fast?
- That was pretty fast.

738
00:42:30,653 --> 00:42:34,083
- I was weaving through it like this.
- You're so much slower than Ji Sung!

739
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,952
Out of my way!

740
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:40,297
[Takes out his anger on Jae Suk.]

741
00:42:40,298 --> 00:42:42,764
- Wow, look at him lashing out.
- You really have a nasty personality.

742
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:44,604
Seriously.

743
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,511
- Wow, look at him.
- Don't talk to me.

744
00:42:47,785 --> 00:42:49,573
- What did you say?
- You're really awful at that.

745
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:53,620
But I'm not the problem here.
The final part is the problem.

746
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,478
But you take up the most amount
of time!

747
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:57,265
- Why are you taking so long?
- What?

748
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,210
- You can't even do it right.
- I told you not to talk to me!

749
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:02,721
- I'm working really hard right now.
- Park Ji Sung, let's you and I fight too!

750
00:43:03,212 --> 00:43:06,052
- Why can't you kick it to me better?
- Why can't you catch the ball?

751
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,821
- Okay, this is our last chance.
- Up or down?

752
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:16,471
- Let's decide which way to go.
- Let's go down.

753
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:17,716
Fighting!

754
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:21,222
- Okay, let's do it right this time.
- Let's do this.

755
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,367
This is our one last chance.

756
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:26,614
[Only one final chance is left.]

757
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,932
Let's please just end this game.

758
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:30,728
Let's go!

759
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:33,410
[There are no more chances!]

760
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:38,949
[We will succeed this mission,
and come out even stronger!]

761
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:42,444
[Their final fifth attempt- Start.]

762
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:48,724
Nice.

763
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,595
[Ji Hyo's steady ball drop.]

764
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:53,991
Kim Jong Kook.

765
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:03,317
[Tiger's bulldozing tactics.]

766
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,238
[This is American football style.]

767
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,970
[Arrives at R3 in lightning speed.]

768
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:17,044
Okay, that's good.

769
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:23,178
[Gary and Suk Jin combo never misses!]

770
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:24,686
Okay, let's succeed this mission!

771
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,438
Suk Jin is doing great.

772
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:35,953
[Kwang Soo's new method-
Dump it with the lid wide open.]

773
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,495
Okay, there you go.

774
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:43,539
[Time sucking Kwang Soo-crow]

775
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,292
You did it!

776
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,610
Okay, you got it, go!

777
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,683
[Full speed ahead!]

778
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:55,792
- Come on Ji Sung.
- This is our last chance!

779
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,444
This is our last chance.

780
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:02,880
- Take your time, Ji Sung.
- Calm down and stay steady.

781
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,757
[There are no more chances.]

782
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,727
This is our last chance.

783
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:36,999
[They succeed through all the courses!]

784
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:42,528
[The mission will be a total success
if they made it within 90 seconds.]

785
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:47,661
[Scarecrow shoulder battles.]

786
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,646
Stand straight in a line.

787
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,766
Okay, come in under my arms.

788
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:58,231
[Standing nicely shoulder to shoulder.]

789
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,050
Your final time is...

790
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,280
[Their final time is...]

791
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:05,169
Two minutes and 24 seconds.

792
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,394
[Final time- Two minutes and 24 seconds.
Mission fail.]

793
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:08,511
Just mix up all the parts that
we succeeded from the other attempts.

794
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:12,089
[When have we ever done that?]

795
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,781
Now that we're in this situation,
the Captain has a different mission to do.

796
00:46:15,782 --> 00:46:17,713
- We just need the Captain to succeed.
- Right?

797
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:20,367
- He just needs to succeed his mission.
- Yeah, we'll be fine then.

798
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,550
We could even say that Ji Sung is
the reason why we failed this mission.

799
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,719
- Because he didn't take it seriously.
- What did you say?

800
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:31,724
Since the last mission was about his skills,
it'll be about his luck this time.

801
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:34,571
[It's time to test the Captain's luck.]

802
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:36,893
Captain's mission is, random chance draw.

803
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,001
- What's going to happen?
- You have to pick the right one.

804
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,030
- You just need to pick the right one.
- Why is that thing so long?

805
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:43,825
- What is that?
- Is it an anaconda?

806
00:46:43,826 --> 00:46:46,144
How many things are there?

807
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:48,144
- It's not an anaconda or something.
- Why is that thing so long?

808
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:51,536
- What's this?
- Open it.

809
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:52,875
You want us to open it?

810
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,227
- One, two, three.
- I hope it's something to drink.

811
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,784
It's a chance game.

812
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:06,571
If you guys had succeeded in your mission,
it would've been a choice between two dishes.

813
00:47:06,572 --> 00:47:10,566
- See, that's what I thought.
- But now your chances have been lowered.

814
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:14,311
It's only in one of those dishes.
There is only one chance card.

815
00:47:14,312 --> 00:47:17,379
You have to choose the dish which you think
has the chance card under it.

816
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,231
Otherwise, you'll find a healthy herbal drink
which you'll have to down in one shot.

817
00:47:20,232 --> 00:47:23,472
- If it's healthy, then I'll drink it.
- It's probably the bitter tea.

818
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:28,706
I bet it's something very bitter.
The staff member is unwrapping the candy.

819
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:31,039
- What's that candy for?
- Okay, get yourself ready.

820
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,283
- I think it's the one in the middle.
- No, I don't think that's it.

821
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:37,041
I think it's the one at the end.

822
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,476
- No, I think it's either this or this.
- I think it's this one.

823
00:47:39,477 --> 00:47:42,136
- I think it's that one over there.
- You don't think it's the one in the middle?

824
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,892
- No, it's that one.
- This one?

825
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:49,485
No, don't listen to anyone,
and you just go with the one you want.

826
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:54,579
[The decision is Captain Park's to make.]

827
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,162
- Just go with whichever one you want.
- But it's not that one.

828
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:02,032
- No, it's not that one!
- No, just go with that one.

829
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:04,924
- Just do it.
- Open the lid.

830
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:10,693
[He opens the dish.]

831
00:48:19,518 --> 00:48:23,053
[Only a 20% chance,
and he picks the chance card!]

832
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:30,868
[Not only is he skilled,
but he also has luck on his side!]

833
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:43,972
[The rest are bitter teas,
and steeped root teas.]

834
00:48:43,973 --> 00:48:46,262
The rest are teas that are very bitter,
but also very good for your health.

835
00:48:46,263 --> 00:48:48,234
- Is it really good for your health?
- Yeah, it's very good for you.

836
00:48:48,235 --> 00:48:49,933
- It's extremely good for your health.
- Seriously?

837
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:54,317
As I've mentioned it to everyone before,
I've had the bitter tea before.

838
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,799
But there are a lot of other teas
that are just as good for you.

839
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,387
- He's drinking the whole thing.
- Give him a piece of candy.

840
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:03,256
- I'm going to have one too.
- Wow, that's nice.

841
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,392
You like it?

842
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,530
- I'm sure it's good for you.
- Then drink this one too.

843
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:14,092
- The aftertaste is even more bitter.
- I think it's good.

844
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:16,116
- The aftertaste is so bitter.
- Are they all the same thing?

845
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:20,945
- Wow, you really are something else.
- Drink it, it's good for you. It's okay.

846
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:24,271
[Captain Park downs his drink too.]

847
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:28,067
- It's good.
- That was good.

848
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:30,640
I'd take this over a piece of candy.

849
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:34,087
- Wow, seriously.
- I'd take this over candy any day.

850
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:39,888
[Dream Cup Boot Camp Training-
Off to their final location.]

851
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:47,129
[Dream Cup Boot camp Training-
Goal Precision Training.]

852
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,657
What's this?

853
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:51,911
- What are we doing here?
- You've completed your first two missions.

854
00:49:51,912 --> 00:49:55,452
- Yes.
- This is your third and final training.

855
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,979
You've gained chance cards from
your first two races.

856
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,475
- Yes.
- Unbelievable, wasn't it?

857
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:02,633
- It was unbelievable.
- There's nothing he can't do.

858
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:07,069
The next training is the most important aspect
when it comes to scoring points in the game.

859
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:10,996
It's a training that helps you hone your
precision skills in scoring goals.

860
00:50:10,997 --> 00:50:13,172
It's the one thing I'm very confident in.

861
00:50:13,173 --> 00:50:15,469
- Why would you have any confidence in that?
- You've never scored a goal before.

862
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,425
Even though you've had the chance to run
out on the field these past two years

863
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:23,893
none of you has yet to score a goal except
for Yoo Jae Suk who almost had his chance.

864
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:27,823
I guarantee that I'll score a goal this year
if you'll only give me the chance to do so.

865
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,032
Me too.

866
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:31,428
What's that over there?

867
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:34,190
- It's a limousine.
- Who's in there?

868
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:38,166
Is someone going to get out?

869
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,503
Is it an actress?

870
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:45,955
[Who will alight from the limousine?]

871
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,874
It's really him!

872
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:53,140
[He's here.]

873
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:58,129
[Korean soccer legend, Cha Bum Geun.]

874
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:06,331
[Caster- 'Cha Bum Geun is Germany's
top number one player.']

875
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:10,512
[At the time, he was the best player
the league has ever seen.]

876
00:51:13,245 --> 00:51:19,059
[1979- Frankfurt.
1983- Leverkusen.]

877
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:29,199
[Played in a total of 308 games.
Scored 98 goals.]

878
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,897
[But he never once kicked a penalty goal.]

879
00:51:36,003 --> 00:51:40,011
[Dubbed by the Germans as
'Brown Fire Bomber.']

880
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:50,217
[Twice won the UEFA Cup from the league.
In Frankfurt in 1980, Leverkusen in 1988.]

881
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:53,762
[Jürgen Klinsmann-
Germany's legendary forward.]

882
00:51:53,763 --> 00:51:55,492
[Won the World Cup in 1990
and led to victory of Euro Cup on 1996.]

883
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:59,518
['Even though I'm acknowledged as a pretty
good forward, but I'm no Cha Bum Geun.']

884
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:05,474
['There's the living legend in the stands.
He's Korea's Cha Bum Geun.']

885
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:14,800
[He rewrote the history of Korean soccer,
and he's here on Running Man.]

886
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:16,926
[He really came!]

887
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:20,740
[Flustered at seeing his most
respected senior here in person.]

888
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,590
Is this the car that you normally
ride around in?

889
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:29,429
[No, but we sent the car to him
when he graciously agreed to come here.]

890
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:32,084
[A visit from the living legend.]

891
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:36,655
[And a meeting with his former pupil.]

892
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:38,169
- Thanks for all your hard work.
- Thank you.

893
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:41,968
I really had no idea that he'd actually come
after our sudden call earlier this morning.

894
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:44,202
I came for Ji Sung.

895
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:48,487
['I came here for Ji Sung.']

896
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:53,856
[The man who made history in soccer...]

897
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:58,817
[And the one who followed in his footsteps.]

898
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:11,535
[Now... a legend meets another legend.]

899
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,701
When Ji Sung called for my help earlier...

900
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:17,015
I realized that I haven't seen him in a while,
and I really wanted to see him.

901
00:53:17,016 --> 00:53:20,063
I didn't even get the chance to go
to his retirement ceremony either.

902
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:23,852
And I wanted to thank him for
all the hard work that he's done.

903
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:25,994
- Wow, that's amazing.
- That's so kind.

904
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,856
But since you're already here,
can you teach us a few things?

905
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,966
But you've got this top star
here right now.

906
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:33,814
- But this is different.
- Your teaching is different.

907
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:36,878
Ji Sung is good, but
learning directly from you is different.

908
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:40,266
Would you be able to gauge our skills
if you see how we kick the ball?

909
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:42,725
I'll be able to tell somewhat
once I see you guys out there.

910
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:46,522
When you either pass or shoot the ball
during crucial moments

911
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,490
then the eyes have to be kept
directly on the ball.

912
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:52,862
Whether you kick the ball with the top
of the side of your foot...

913
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,206
[A bad kicking stance.]

914
00:53:55,207 --> 00:54:01,228
If you would've just kicked out your foot
like this, then it would've went straight out.

915
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:05,239
- The way he's explaining it is much better.
- Ji Sung never explained it like this.

916
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,876
- He just wants to be the only good player.
- He only cares about his own plays.

917
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:12,164
- He only cares about looking good himself.
- They still don't improve even if I do.

918
00:54:12,603 --> 00:54:15,283
You can't be that mean.

919
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:17,549
- I think what he's saying is important.
- Yes, I agree.

920
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,954
Should we take turns kicking the ball?

921
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,591
- Since we have Coach Cha here...
- Should we all take turns kicking?

922
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,913
It's a real honor to have Coach Cha here
to coach us like this.

923
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:27,342
I know that it's too late

924
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:31,593
but when he used to teach soccer,
I really wanted to take a lesson.

925
00:54:31,628 --> 00:54:33,626
I feel like I'm getting to live out
one of my dreams.

926
00:54:33,627 --> 00:54:37,850
Let's have Ji Sung show us a demonstration.

927
00:54:37,851 --> 00:54:41,954
[Park Ji Sung to show everyone
a demonstration of how it's done.]

928
00:54:41,955 --> 00:54:47,106
For amateurs, it's important for them to get
the right foot stance next to the ball.

929
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:48,616
That's right, make a firm stance.

930
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,599
Just think of it as swinging your leg out
directly forward from the back.

931
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,970
Let's have Park Ji Sung show us all
a demonstration of how to do it.

932
00:54:57,286 --> 00:55:00,293
- Shoot your leg out straight.
- Don't hurt yourself while doing it.

933
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:08,575
[Make a firm stance next to the ball...]

934
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,841
[And swing out the other foot
straight ahead.]

935
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:18,448
Don't move that foot on the side of the ball
until you've finished swinging your kick.

936
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,404
No, don't move that other foot.

937
00:55:25,938 --> 00:55:27,967
No, don't move that foot
and just swing it out straight.

938
00:55:27,968 --> 00:55:31,584
- No, just leave that foot alone.
- We can't move the foot.

939
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,865
[An explosion of practices.]

940
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:38,233
You have to have a firm footing.
Make a firm stance with that foot.

941
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:41,212
Think of standing up tall with
a slight lean off to the side.

942
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,705
[Lean the body weight slightly off
to the side when kicking the ball.]

943
00:55:44,117 --> 00:55:47,995
[No matter what Coach Cha says,
they immediately fall into practice mode.]

944
00:55:48,837 --> 00:55:52,426
- That's the way to do it.
- Coach Cha, I'd like to try it as well.

945
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,572
- Okay, give it a try, Ji Hyo.
- I'd like to give it a try as well.

946
00:55:57,012 --> 00:55:58,826
Be careful with your foot
so that you don't hurt yourself.

947
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:00,521
[Blank Ji takes her turn with the kick.]

948
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:10,388
[Even though her kick may have been weak,
her direction was precise.]

949
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:12,434
It actually went towards the goal.

950
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,572
That was good.

951
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:17,372
- It went towards the goal.
- Coach Cha just said that it was good.

952
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:21,354
[A model student-
A firm stance and footing.]

953
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:23,326
It's different now that
we've had proper training.

954
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:26,345
You have to have a steady stance,
and find your balance.

955
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,683
[Coach Cha demonstrates the kick himself.]

956
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:34,703
[Steady stance... and a clean swing.]

957
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,460
- He's a hundred times better than us.
- He's on a whole different level.

958
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,602
[He's that good while wearing dress shoes.]

959
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:41,750
Go!

960
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,569
- He keeps interfering.
- He keeps playing around.

961
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,887
You can't kick if you're that sensitive.
Don't pay him any attention and just do it.

962
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:53,743
- Don't pay him any attention and just do it.
- No, then you won't be able to do it.

963
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,501
You have to forget about everything else.
[I love you, Coach Cha.]

964
00:56:56,502 --> 00:57:00,473
[Mentality is just as important as skills
when playing out on the field.]

965
00:57:03,406 --> 00:57:05,356
You have to keep going even if
he were to spit at you.

966
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:12,554
I'll just endure it.

967
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,192
Okay, here I go.
I'm really going.

968
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:18,967
[Ha Ha's kick.]

969
00:57:24,205 --> 00:57:26,266
- That was too much.
- Not what you had intended.

970
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,398
- It wasn't totally bad.
- Thank you!

971
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:30,830
- Just need more practice. You have potential.
- Thank you!

972
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:32,467
[Haroro is showing some potential!]

973
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,446
Okay, Gary's going to go.

974
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:42,155
[Decent stance and a strong kick.]

975
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:43,890
Good, that was a good kick.

976
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:48,748
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, I'll kick this time.

977
00:57:48,749 --> 00:57:50,045
[Last up is Kwang Soo.]

978
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:52,106
Knees bent, body forward,
and leg straight out.

979
00:57:52,107 --> 00:57:54,285
- Yes, that's correct.
- He's a model student.

980
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:55,894
Wow, let's see this.

981
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:05,921
[Knees bent, body forward,
and leg straight out.]

982
00:58:06,973 --> 00:58:09,752
[Huh? Something looks funny...]

983
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:13,052
[He did everything that he just said,
but something looks a little off.]

984
00:58:13,053 --> 00:58:14,526
The stance was pretty good.

985
00:58:15,398 --> 00:58:18,840
But your footing was
too far behind the ball.

986
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:21,223
[The problem was that his footing was
too far behind the actual ball.]

987
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:23,014
The footing should be more forward,
okay, I think I got it.

988
00:58:23,015 --> 00:58:25,694
But your form wasn't bad.

989
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:30,873
[One point kicking lesson-
Don't cower the body, but kick naturally.]

990
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,089
- Okay, I got it.
- Can you show me, Jae Suk?

991
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,757
- There you go.
- I get it now.

992
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,514
- The way you use your shoulder is...
- You swing out your arms.

993
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:42,709
Stretch your arm out, and swing.

994
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,971
You didn't tell us anything about
stretching the arm out at first.

995
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:52,840
I'll try it again in that position.
Thank you.

996
00:58:53,306 --> 00:58:54,882
Stretch out your arm.

997
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,173
There you go!

998
00:59:01,344 --> 00:59:03,280
There you go!

999
00:59:05,648 --> 00:59:10,211
[His kick improves drastically with
one piece of advice from Coach Cha.]

1000
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:12,536
- This is how you coach.
- This is how you do it.

1001
00:59:12,537 --> 00:59:15,321
[The effects of a one point lesson
that could be felt with their whole body.]

1002
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:25,469
[Amazing- The only thing he did differently
was to stretch out his arm in front of him.]

1003
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,095
Stretch out your arm.

1004
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,619
Can you tell us who you thought
did the best job of kicking the ball?

1005
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,771
- I'm your loyal pupil.
- Coach Cha, I'm your apt pupil.

1006
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:38,242
- I didn't get to do that at first.
- Can you tell us some more pointers?

1007
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:40,390
Him over there and this one.

1008
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:45,707
[He chooses Kwang Soo and Gary.]

1009
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,613
- I love you!
- Thank you!

1010
00:59:48,187 --> 00:59:51,354
[A kissing ceremony.]

1011
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:52,937
Thank you so much!

1012
00:59:52,938 --> 00:59:55,762
- No, you didn't do that.
- Yes, I did.

1013
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:58,527
If you're this good during your first lesson,
then you guys are really good.

1014
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:01,980
I'm starting to feel the passion for soccer
bubbling up inside me right now.

1015
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,171
- I really want to play now.
- Me too.

1016
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:06,985
Coach Cha will be staying to watch
your mission to the end.

1017
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:09,579
I will now reveal your next mission.

1018
01:00:10,695 --> 01:00:12,997
It's a kicking related mission.

1019
01:00:12,998 --> 01:00:16,399
You will all take turns
kicking the penalty kick.

1020
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,233
But instead of a goal keeper

1021
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:25,270
there will be two baseball players with
a baseball bat standing in front of the goal.

1022
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:30,060
Those two players will bat the balls which
you'll try to kick into the net.

1023
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:34,601
[If four out of the eight kickers can kick
the ball in, then the mission is a success.]

1024
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,680
They're both currently baseball players
at a local university.

1025
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:40,868
- Please take good care of us.
- Take good care of us.

1026
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:43,017
Fighting!

1027
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:49,691
[Kicker number one- Kim Jong Kook.]

1028
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:50,979
Keep your eye on the ball.

1029
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,023
- Kim Jong Kook, fighting!
- Fighting!

1030
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,426
If you kick it just like that, then
they won't be able to stop the ball.

1031
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:57,832
Okay, here I go.

1032
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:02,771
[Locking in on where
he'll be kicking the ball.]

1033
01:01:17,938 --> 01:01:20,217
[Homerun]

1034
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:28,299
[Jong Kook fails.]

1035
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,804
- You're way too good.
- You really must be a baseball player.

1036
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:33,076
- They're no joke.
- No, this is no joke.

1037
01:01:36,077 --> 01:01:39,022
[Kicker number two- Yoo Jae Suk.]

1038
01:01:39,023 --> 01:01:41,024
There's no reason why
we even need to have Ji Sung kick.

1039
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:43,852
[Now only seven kickers are left.
Still has four goals to make.]

1040
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:05,119
But it was a good kick.

1041
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,104
[Nice kick, but still fails.]

1042
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:10,750
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook have both failed.]

1043
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:13,601
The penalty zone is too far.

1044
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:17,881
[There you go, time to protest.]

1045
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,602
The penalty kick is only eleven meters.

1046
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,962
[Huh?]

1047
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:29,493
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven.

1048
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:31,815
[Checking to make sure it's only 11 ft.
to help out his pupils.]

1049
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:34,103
- I think it's pretty much the same.
- It's not much of a difference.

1050
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:36,929
[No kidding...]

1051
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,087
- That's a little bit closer.
- But that's not much of a difference.

1052
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:43,728
[The only way for them to repay his kindness
is to make the goal.]

1053
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:45,675
Thank you, Sir!
We vow to succeed the mission.

1054
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:48,095
We will make sure to repay you
for all your kindness and grace.

1055
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:50,301
[Don't just try to fill it with words.]

1056
01:02:51,337 --> 01:02:53,347
Please... God of Ddakji!

1057
01:02:53,348 --> 01:02:55,579
Why are you talking about ddakji
when we're playing soccer?

1058
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,047
[Kicker number three is praying to
the god of ddakji on a soccer field.]

1059
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,639
[Team Running Man's first goal!]

1060
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:19,692
[It's a miracle!
Big-nose scores a goal after his lesson!]

1061
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:23,552
[God of ddakji... thank you!]

1062
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,090
I can't believe that just happened!

1063
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:30,493
[Only five chances now remain,
and three more goals must be made.]

1064
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,793
[Kicker number four- Gary.]

1065
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:36,411
- Come on, Gary!
- Gary!

1066
01:03:36,845 --> 01:03:39,947
[Gary, with an approval from Coach Cha...]

1067
01:03:39,948 --> 01:03:42,191
[Will he be able to live up to
the expectation as a star pupil?]

1068
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:49,532
[A direct kick right through the center.]

1069
01:03:56,383 --> 01:03:59,807
[A great kick befitting of a star pupil.]

1070
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,837
Thank you for your teachings!

1071
01:04:02,994 --> 01:04:05,695
Wow, that was amazing.

1072
01:04:09,355 --> 01:04:11,745
We only need two more, Ha Ha.

1073
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:25,533
[The ball didn't even get close...]

1074
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:28,020
That was almost insulting.

1075
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,082
He was almost insulting with
the way he hit the ball out of there.

1076
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,957
[Only three kickers left,
and they still need two more goals.]

1077
01:04:33,475 --> 01:04:35,406
Be careful and keep your eye on the ball.

1078
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,697
[Kicker number six- Song Ji Hyo.]

1079
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:46,031
[My foot...]

1080
01:04:46,032 --> 01:04:48,371
- That has to hurt.
- I bet that hurts.

1081
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:53,092
- No, you did good.
- It's okay.

1082
01:04:56,576 --> 01:04:59,313
[The only kickers left remaining now are
Park Ji Sung...]

1083
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:01,776
[... and Giraffe.]

1084
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,800
[This isn't good.]

1085
01:05:06,108 --> 01:05:08,861
[Kicker number seven- Park Ji Sung.]

1086
01:05:08,862 --> 01:05:10,371
If Ji Sung doesn't make it in,
then we're in big trouble.

1087
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:14,670
[Captain Park, with a high probability
of succeeding, but the problem is...]

1088
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,849
[...him.]

1089
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:31,150
[A precisely clean kick.]

1090
01:05:41,774 --> 01:05:46,364
[That's our Eternal Captain!]

1091
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:49,320
[One more goal is needed in order
for them to succeed the mission.]

1092
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,214
[Final kicker- Lee Kwang Soo.]

1093
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,829
- You saw where to kick, right?
- Yes, I saw.

1094
01:05:56,065 --> 01:05:59,300
Knees bent, body forward,
and leg straight out.

1095
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,830
- Fighting!
- Find the right footing.

1096
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:08,336
[The footing... the footing...]

1097
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:14,259
[Kwang Soo has shown that he's a good
follower of Coach Cha's instructions.]

1098
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,385
[He was even chosen to be one
of the best kickers of the team.]

1099
01:06:19,034 --> 01:06:23,052
[Just do... as I've been taught.]

1100
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:30,742
[Fail or succeed...
Everything rides on the Giraffe's kick.]

1101
01:06:48,966 --> 01:06:51,389
[Giraffe actually did it!]

1102
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:56,315
[It's all thanks to your teachings!]

1103
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:01,419
[Team Running Man improves their
kicking precision after just one lesson!]

1104
01:07:04,435 --> 01:07:08,925
Let's give a big round of applause to the two
players who came out to help us today.

1105
01:07:08,926 --> 01:07:11,412
[Thank you for your participation.]

1106
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:15,899
More than anything else, let's give a huge
round of thanks to our Coach Cha.

1107
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,275
[A heartfelt gratitude to Coach Cha.]

1108
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:22,586
- With just one lesson from Coach Cha...
- Our skills have greatly improved.

1109
01:07:22,587 --> 01:07:24,938
[The miraculous effects of
the one pointer lesson.]

1110
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:29,946
Since you've succeeded this mission,
there's an easier Captain's mission for you.

1111
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,316
- Okay, bring it in.
- What's that now?

1112
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:38,273
[A ring of fire?]

1113
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:41,504
- This is the easier mission?
- Then what's the difficult mission?

1114
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:45,603
The difficult mission was with a smaller
and a taller ring of fire.

1115
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:48,348
Wow, that's not going to be easy.
To score a goal through that...

1116
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:51,348
Even Coach Cha is saying that
making that goal isn't going to be easy.

1117
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:54,370
[Captain's mission-
Kick the ball through the ring of fire.]

1118
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:56,604
- For an amateur to make that goal...
- No, Ji Sung will be doing it.

1119
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,794
Coach Cha, would you like to
give it a try?

1120
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:02,354
- How about you give it a try?
- What do you do it with?

1121
01:08:02,355 --> 01:08:06,577
- Kick the ball through the ring.
- That's going to be tough.

1122
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:11,139
Cha Bum Geun.

1123
01:08:11,165 --> 01:08:15,978
Only someone as good as
Park Ji Sung can do this.

1124
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:19,981
- Wow, that's really high up there.
- Coach Cha! Coach Cha!

1125
01:08:19,982 --> 01:08:21,248
[For a living legend... it may be possible.]

1126
01:08:21,249 --> 01:08:23,208
- Let me practice first.
- Okay.

1127
01:08:23,835 --> 01:08:25,848
Coach Cha!

1128
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:29,213
[Legendary Coach Cha
will do this mission himself!]

1129
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:33,598
Then Coach Cha will do this mission himself,
and he'll have three chances to get it done.

1130
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:36,760
[Kick the ball through the ring of fire
to succeed the mission.]

1131
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:39,679
The last time I really kicked a ball...

1132
01:08:40,774 --> 01:08:44,026
I think it's been over ten years
since I've last kicked a soccer ball.

1133
01:08:47,064 --> 01:08:52,831
[Legendary Cha Bum Geun...
meets the ball for the first time in 10 years.]

1134
01:08:53,494 --> 01:08:55,690
[First attempt.]

1135
01:08:55,691 --> 01:08:57,710
I don't know about these dress shoes.

1136
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,629
[No matter how difficult, if it's him...]

1137
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,825
[Bounces off the rim!]

1138
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:21,438
[How can this be!]

1139
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:25,335
[Fails the first out of his three chances.]

1140
01:09:26,693 --> 01:09:31,107
[He truly is a legend! Almost
makes it in on his very first attempt!]

1141
01:09:32,395 --> 01:09:35,403
It's because I have these dress shoes on
and the ground is uneven.

1142
01:09:39,065 --> 01:09:40,900
See?
Did you see that?

1143
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:44,642
<i>It was the uneven ground...</i>

1144
01:09:46,274 --> 01:09:50,682
- Can you try it one more time?
- Let me change into my soccer shoes first.

1145
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:52,957
- Soccer shoes.
- Hand me a pair of soccer shoes.

1146
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:55,322
Wow, Coach Cha is putting on
the soccer shoes.

1147
01:09:55,323 --> 01:09:58,401
[His competitive streak
is starting to peek out.]

1148
01:10:03,482 --> 01:10:09,033
[Legendary Cha Bum Geun...
He puts on the soccer shoes.]

1149
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:20,573
[Cha Bum Geun's second attempt
after changing into his soccer shoes.]

1150
01:10:24,143 --> 01:10:27,036
- I think you've got this now.
- Let's give him some space.

1151
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:30,800
Can you guys even out the
ground for me?

1152
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:33,687
[Everyone jumps in to follow his wishes.]

1153
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,755
Now that I've got the soccer shoes on...

1154
01:10:36,622 --> 01:10:38,101
Okay.

1155
01:10:38,102 --> 01:10:41,089
I'm starting to feel
my competitive streak coming out.

1156
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:45,394
[Second attempt.]

1157
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:56,737
[Will it... make it in this time?]

1158
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:11,809
[Bounces off the ring again!]

1159
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:18,272
[Precise direction! Everyone
thought that it was going to make it!]

1160
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:22,043
[Fails the second out of three chances.]

1161
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:29,007
[If it had been just a little bit lower...]

1162
01:11:31,384 --> 01:11:35,627
[His one last chance.]

1163
01:11:42,887 --> 01:11:47,178
[Throws the ball with his hands...]

1164
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:14,016
[The ball with
everyone's hope riding on it...]

1165
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:22,824
[He shoots it through!]

1166
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:41,455
[Even though 25 years have passed
since his retirement...]

1167
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:45,232
[His skills haven't diminished one bit.]

1168
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:54,272
[A clean shot for the joy
of all his juniors and pupils.]

1169
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:01,988
[The level of a legend's skills has been shown
right in front of everyone's eyes.]

1170
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:11,176
This is the first time he's touched
a soccer ball in over ten years.

1171
01:13:12,258 --> 01:13:16,695
[A cheer of respect that bubbles up
from the bottom of their hearts.]

1172
01:13:17,585 --> 01:13:20,567
Let's give our Coach Cha another
big round of applause.

1173
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,956
I guess Coach Cha was happy about it too
because he threw his hands up in cheer.

1174
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:31,225
- He was so excited about it.
- That was a hard shot.

1175
01:13:34,008 --> 01:13:37,145
Since you succeeded the mission,
you win another chance card.

1176
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:41,118
[Another chance card is won thanks to
the legend succeeding their mission for them.]

1177
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:47,527
[Dream Cup Boot Camp Training ends.]

1178
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:49,231
The only thing we have left to go
is the final competition.

1179
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:53,682
[Only final competition remains-
A soccer match with the top idol athletes.]

1180
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:57,089
[The bloody battle is about to start.]

1181
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,101
I had a wonderful time today.

1182
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:05,088
And to our beloved Park Ji Sung,
who has brought all of us in this country...

1183
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:10,444
so much joy.

1184
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:15,952
It truly has been the greatest gift.

1185
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:19,891
It's a bit disappointing that we won't get to
see him play anymore now that he's retired

1186
01:14:19,892 --> 01:14:26,574
but I wish that our soccer fans will continue
to give their love and support to Ji Sung.

1187
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,139
Thank you.

1188
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:32,683
Please give another huge round
of applause to Coach Cha Bum Geun.

1189
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:36,376
[Representative of Korean soccer,
Coach Cha- Thank you so very much!]

1190
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:43,190
[Dream Cup Boot camp Training- Course Four.
Match against the top idol athletes.]

1191
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:47,013
[Incheon soccer field.]

1192
01:14:47,014 --> 01:14:48,966
Thank you to everyone for all
your hard work.

1193
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,918
This is your final mission of the day.

1194
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:56,831
It's a soccer match against all the top
idol athletes.

1195
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:59,194
[Soccer match against the top idol athletes.]

1196
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:03,162
These are the idols who are rumored to be
quite good at playing soccer.

1197
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:05,726
We carefully selected each player to
put together a formidable soccer team.

1198
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:08,478
Please look off to the side to see
who your opponents are.

1199
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:10,921
- Who is it?
- Look at the size of their shoulders.

1200
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,325
[They don't look nervous in the least
even with Captain Park out on the field.]

1201
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:24,712
[Chang Min, Dong Jun, Doo Joon, Ki Kwang,
Yoseob, Min Hyuk, Leo, and Baro.]

1202
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,861
[It's nice to see you all!
A fierce battle waits for them ahead.]

1203
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,077
- Wow, these guys are really good.
- These guys are great runners.

1204
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:44,212
[Team Park Ji Sung is feeling the pressure.]

1205
01:15:44,213 --> 01:15:46,114
Doo Joon is a really good soccer player!

1206
01:15:46,115 --> 01:15:48,144
[Doo Joon and Leo
actually used to be soccer players.]

1207
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:54,192
The star of 2002 World Cup who will
lead the Idol Team is...

1208
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:55,468
Who is it?

1209
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:58,752
[The star of 2002 World Cup?]

1210
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,729
[His charismatic walk...]

1211
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:09,654
<i>The star of 2002 World Cup...</i>

1212
01:16:10,585 --> 01:16:14,367
<i>He's nicknamed The Sniper,
his name is Seol Ki Hyun!</i>

1213
01:16:16,954 --> 01:16:20,989
[The Sniper, Seol Ki Hyun.]

1214
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:24,472
[Can still remember
the excitement of the match.]

1215
01:16:24,473 --> 01:16:29,330
[The 2002 World Cup game against Italy-
The star of that miraculous moment.]

1216
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:35,862
[Swept through all of Europe
including England and Belgium.]

1217
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:39,767
[The real sniper, Seol Ki Hyun.]

1218
01:16:41,077 --> 01:16:44,372
Sniper Seol Ki Hyun is here
to coach the Idol Team!

1219
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,813
But he's not going to
actually play in the game.

1220
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:57,775
[Sniper Seol Ki Hyun...
reunites with Park Ji Sung.]

1221
01:17:05,056 --> 01:17:06,327
It's good to see you.

1222
01:17:07,693 --> 01:17:09,109
He looks like a model.

1223
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,626
Hello, my name is Seol Ki Hyun,
and I'll be coaching the Idol Team.

1224
01:17:14,615 --> 01:17:16,086
He's so cool.

1225
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,687
If you're going to be tall,
that's the right way to be tall.

1226
01:17:18,688 --> 01:17:20,333
Just being tall like Kwang Soo is no good.

1227
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:24,663
- That's the way to be tall.
- We just have different styles.

1228
01:17:24,664 --> 01:17:27,611
[Even though your styles may be different,
we vote for Seol Ki Hyun's style.]

1229
01:17:28,373 --> 01:17:32,757
The main reason that I'm here is because
I haven't seen Ji Sung in so long.

1230
01:17:32,758 --> 01:17:35,604
It's been so long since I've had the chance
to see Ji Sung in person myself.

1231
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,577
- Go stand next to him.
- Go stand over there.

1232
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:41,682
Why are you being so shy?

1233
01:17:41,683 --> 01:17:44,334
[Former co-players who are finally reunited.]

1234
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:48,552
I'm reminded of 2002 again.

1235
01:17:48,553 --> 01:17:50,908
The combo play between you two...

1236
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:53,440
How is this game going to be played?

1237
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:57,241
I will explain the rules of the games to you.

1238
01:17:57,242 --> 01:18:00,934
Running Man Dream Cup Idol Match.

1239
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:04,612
First and second half of the game will
last 15 minutes each.

1240
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,665
You can swap out the players anytime
you'd like at any given time.

1241
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:12,673
How many chance cards have you won?

1242
01:18:12,674 --> 01:18:14,337
- Three.
- We have three of them.

1243
01:18:14,338 --> 01:18:16,139
The chance cards you have in your hands...

1244
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:22,650
can be used to buy play time for
Park Ji Sung during this game tonight.

1245
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,529
Each chance card will buy him
five minutes.

1246
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,114
[Five minutes per card,
hence a total of 15 play time for Ji Sung.]

1247
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:33,870
[His soccer uniform is at the dry cleaners.]

1248
01:18:47,714 --> 01:18:49,646
We will now start the first half!

1249
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:59,952
[Team Seol Ki Hyun's Idol- Forward.]

1250
01:18:59,953 --> 01:19:02,980
Bring it down!
Bring it down here!

1251
01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:06,375
Let's take it easy!

1252
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:11,939
[Coach Seol takes his coaching very seriously
as soon as the game starts.]

1253
01:19:12,772 --> 01:19:15,308
Ki Hyun, why are you taking this so seriously?

1254
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:17,302
- Why are you taking it so seriously?
- Because you're going to be playing too.

1255
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:18,732
It's because you'll be playing too.

1256
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,676
We have to score as many goals
as we can before you get in the game.

1257
01:19:21,409 --> 01:19:23,024
Go, go!

1258
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:33,135
[Baro's impressive footwork.]

1259
01:19:34,648 --> 01:19:36,556
Wow, they're so fast.

1260
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,127
Why are there so many of them out here?

1261
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:46,130
[Ki Kwang's solo play that requires
two players in an attempt to block him.]

1262
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:50,896
[Attempts to kick in a goal
as soon as the game starts.]

1263
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:00,008
[Much more formidable than
Team RM had ever imagined.]

1264
01:20:00,977 --> 01:20:02,878
Just hang out here, and don't move.

1265
01:20:02,879 --> 01:20:04,333
Just leave him.

1266
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:06,210
He's no joke.

1267
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:10,023
[A clean kick straight over to Ki Kwang.]

1268
01:20:10,024 --> 01:20:11,981
Get on him!

1269
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,497
Get on him!

1270
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:28,429
[Ki Kwang scores the first goal!]

1271
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,600
[Team Park Ji Sung: 0
Team Seol Ki Hyun's Idols: 1]

1272
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,243
[Even Coach Seol is impressed
with the goal.]

1273
01:20:39,244 --> 01:20:40,733
Score another one.

1274
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:43,804
Let's score ten more before
Park Ji Sung gets out here.

1275
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:47,168
[Score as many as they can
before Captain Park comes out to play?]

1276
01:20:56,721 --> 01:21:00,107
[Oh no... you'll be able
to help them out, right?]

1277
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:05,670
[Team Ji Sung is on the offense for once,
and they're immediately intercepted.]

1278
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:11,392
[Blank Ji's ball is stolen from her.]

1279
01:21:15,124 --> 01:21:17,352
[Giraffe's hands are kept frantically busy.]

1280
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:24,062
[Min Hyuk scores another goal
for Team Seol's Idols.]

1281
01:21:25,237 --> 01:21:28,227
[Team Park Ji Sung is getting beaten!]

1282

[Captain's wasted boot camp training.]

1284
01:21:37,568 --> 01:21:39,652
Should we bring Ji Sung in?

1285
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:43,490
I don't think it'll make much difference
even if I were to go in the game.

1286
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:46,794
Why do they all look so fresh
and cheerful?

1287
01:21:48,387 --> 01:21:53,403
[Fresh Idols- Singing is their hobby,
and soccer is their specialty.]

1288
01:21:53,886 --> 01:21:55,208

No, it's just me.

1292
01:22:10,395 --> 01:22:14,165
[We have to be more sparing
with the Captain.]

1293
01:22:15,919 --> 01:22:20,441
[Player swap-
Gary- in, Ji Hyo- out.]

You have to block the center.

1295

[One on one against the goal keeper.]

1304

1314
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:53,614
[Without any hesitation... he shoots!]

1315
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,700
[Please miss... please miss!]

1316
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:06,818

[Will he be able to turn the current score
of 3:0 around?]

1325
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:53,612
He's in the game!

1326
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:56,732
I'm so scared!

1327
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,495
[What do we do now?]

1328
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,319
Don't kick the ball towards Park Ji Sung!

1329
01:25:11,449 --> 01:25:15,854
[Attempts to pass the ball over to Ji Sung.
His attempt fails.]

He's so fast!

1341
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,504

[Ten years are shaved off their lives.]

1349

[Just amazed at his footwork!]

1354
01:27:36,182 --> 01:27:39,042
When Park Ji Sung runs out there,
I feel like a rampant bull is running.

[The ball is passed back to Ji Sung.]

1356

Go back!
Go back and catch him!

1357
01:27:57,571 --> 01:28:01,608
[Lets the ball fly toward the goal keeper?]

1358
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:11,393
[Passes the ball directly over to Gary!]

1359

scores their first goal!]

- This is good!
- It's okay, it's just one.

1364
01:28:43,588 --> 01:28:45,507
It was just one.

1365
01:28:45,809 --> 01:28:48,121
Can you count that as two points for us?

1366
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:53,494
[First half is now over.]

1367
01:28:57,509 --> 01:29:01,796
The problem is...
we're not playing offense at all.

1368
01:29:01,797 --> 01:29:03,806
We have to play offense too.

1369
01:29:03,807 --> 01:29:07,770
The other team has a lot of guys who know
how to kick the ball around.

1370
01:29:08,245 --> 01:29:10,532
Let's think about the lesson
we received earlier.

1371
01:29:10,533 --> 01:29:13,462
- They're all real soccer players.
- We're so sorry, Coach Cha.

1372

We really didn't want to disappoint you.

1373

I don't know if I can use
the teaching that I was taught today.

1374

[Please watch over us, Coach Cha.]

1375
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:23,699
- We don't have much time.
- We have to keep running hard.

1376
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,407
I think I can put myself on one person
and just stay on that person like glue.

1377
01:29:27,371 --> 01:29:30,022
- Just bite him down.
- Stick to him like a wad of gum.

1378
01:29:30,383 --> 01:29:33,701
Even if you end up kicking your opponent,
it's not a foul if the referee doesn't see it.

1379
01:29:34,181 --> 01:29:39,229
[He's slowly starting to think like
a true Running Man member.]

1380
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,779
It's just that he's never been
caught yet.

1381
01:29:43,239 --> 01:29:44,766
Let's all do this.

1382
01:29:45,104 --> 01:29:49,850
[Second half- Start.]

1383
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:52,210
Get out there.
Everyone get out there.

1384

[Coach Seol is getting even more
serious about his coaching.]

1385
01:30:03,405 --> 01:30:06,800
[Oh my gosh- He gets greedy
about scoring on his own team.]

1386
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:08,929
What in the world is the matter with you!

1387
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,414

his own mistake.]

[Two chance cards are still left.
A total of ten play minutes for Ji Sung.]

1395
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:55,266
[Team Ji Sung can't get the ball
past the center line.]

1396
01:31:06,793 --> 01:31:09,729
[Is he playing 'alkkaggi'
with the soccer ball?]

1397
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:14,333
[Team Park Ji Sung: 1

take this off.

[Park Ji Sung decides to enter the game!]

1404
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:46,765
[With only ten minutes left in the game,
will he be able to turn the game around?]

1405
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:49,912
- He took his jacket off.
- This is crazy!

1406
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:53,967
[Does it mean that Captain Park
is really going to bring it?]

1407
01:31:53,968 --> 01:31:55,651
We made him take off his jacket.

1408
01:31:56,694 --> 01:31:59,115
Wow, this is crazy!
We made him take off his jacket.

1409

too much, Ji Sung.</i>

if they get scared.

['Kim-Enthusiastic' is already
wanting to escape.]

1414
01:32:14,966 --> 01:32:18,328
- Get out of his way if you're scared.
- Get ready to play defense!

1415
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,255
[Should I get this game started?]

1416

put me in a tough spot.

Do it!
