00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:06,568
Wow, this isn't even right.
This is just...

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,415
What's that?
It's moving!

4
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:11,019
It's staring at me.

5
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,923
It's staring at me right now.

00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,833

00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:32,200

[All the members are heading out to
participate in the upcoming Dream Cup.]

12
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,860
I love you, Jakarta.
I love Indonesia.

13
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,652
We'll see you in Indonesia.

14
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:02,134

[Last week's boot camp training
with Captain Park.]

00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:12,303
[Each and every one of those
challenging moments...]

18
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,723
[And the special lesson that they've
received from legend himself, Cha Bum Geun.]

19
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:23,152
[Cha Bum Geun and Captain Park-
The training camp led by two legends.]

20
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:28,106
[We will not be the same
as we were last year.]

21
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:39,166
[Indonesia- a place where nature and
people coexists in harmony.]

22
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,100

of people are alive and breathing.]

soon open its doors.]

[Jakarta- Soccer stadium.]

25
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:57,872
This is the field where
I'm going to score my very first goal.

26
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,661
- Why do you think it's going to be you?
- I'm going to score my first goal here.

27

[The largest soccer stadium in Indonesia
with seats for 80,000 spectators.]

00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,154
Suk Jin, are you okay?

33
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,546
- Where is Park Ji Sung?
- I saw him arriving a little while ago.

34
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,998
- What's taking him so long?
- There he is right now. Ji Sung!

35
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,069
[Captain Park makes his appearance.]

36
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,721

[Everyone's starting to suck up to
Captain Park for a place on the field.]

38

- What have you all been doing?
- We've been practicing.

39
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,855
- We were warming up a bit.
- We were practicing our kicks.

40
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,755
- We were warming up.
- You're just now warming up?

41
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:54,515
I think you'll be quite surprised when you
see us running out on the field.

42
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:57,391
We've been practicing,
and we're so much lighter on our feet now.

43
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,480
- You look exhausted already.
- No, not at all.

44
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:03,776
I would like to sincerely welcome
all of you to Jakarta.

45
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,167
Today is the day of the much anticipated
Dream Cup game.

46
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:10,222

[Special boot camping training under their belt.

will be out on the field competing for
the honor of taking home The Dream Cup.

50
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:26,474
- Park Ji Sung has invited some guests...
- Oh my gosh!

51
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:37,041
[Wait, that man is...]

52
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:46,407
[The legend of Korean soccer-
Cha Bum Geun!]

53
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:48,473
- Have you been well?
- It's Cha Boom!

54
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:51,382
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the World Cup right now?

55
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:54,246
[Not only is he a soccer legend,
but he's the lead sportscaster for Korea.]

56
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:58,452
[But what is he suddenly doing here in Jakarta
instead of being at the World Cup games?]

57
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:02,069
I came because I was worried
about you guys.

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,653
- I came because I was worried.
- We're so glad you're here.

59
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:06,207
We're so glad that you came,
and thank you!

60
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,555
We're working very hard with
the teachings that you gave us.

61
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,575
Coach... hello!

62
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,552
[Haroro is greeting the coach in
the shooting stance that he's been taught.]

63
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,905
<i>Knees bent, chest forward,
and straighten out the leg.</i>

64
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,933
[A one pointer lesson from the legend
that they all took to heart.]

65
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,109
<i>Step up next to the ball,
and then make your move.</i>

66
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,900
[Even received some pointers on how
to dribble the ball more skillfully.]

67
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,166
I had no idea why
you were doing this at first.

68
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,843
But we seriously have improved our skills
greatly since your lesson.

69
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:34,169
- I heard that you guys have improved a lot.
- Yes, we've improved greatly.

70
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:37,861
The one pointer lesson you gave us greatly
improved all of our skills.

71
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:41,056
I felt like everyone took to the lesson from
the coach well and have improved their skills

72
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:43,260
and I thought that you guys would perform
better if Coach Cha was here in person.

73
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:46,681
- I can't believe that he's here!
- Thank you, Coach Cha!

74
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:52,421
[Captain Park paid a personal visit to Cha Bum
and invited him to attend the Dream Cup.]

75
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,657
I wanted to see all of you play in the game

76
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:59,462
and I also wanted to see for myself
how much your skills have improved.

77
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:02,559
- We really have improved greatly.
- We can even do heading shoots now.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,867
- I'm going to watch you play in the game.
- Okay!

79
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,471
We will keep your lesson fresh
in our minds.

80
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,359
You have to play well in the game so that
the lesson I gave you guys feels validated.

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,387
- Yes, of course.
- I feel like their skills are still lacking.

82
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,506
If you feel that you're up for it...

83
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,973
I was wondering how you would feel about
playing in the game yourself today.

84
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:21,588
- Are you going to play in the game?
- Well, I...

85
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,002
[Will the legendary Cha Boom play
in the game himself?]

86
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:27,109
- Well...
- Cha Bum Geun! Cha Bum Geun!

87
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,752
- Seriously?
- Is he really going to play?

88
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:34,865
- I'm 62 years old right now.
- But still, you're The Cha Bum Geun.

89
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:38,057
- How about just for ten minutes?
- Not even just ten minutes of playing?

90
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:39,682
[Age is nothing but a number
to a legend like Cha Boom.]

91
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:44,672
[Legend will never fade away.]

92
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:47,872
- I think you will be a huge help to us.
- We will help you any way that we can.

93
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:51,538
- Who's going to pass the ball over to me?
- I'll pass the ball over to you.

94
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,635
[Player number 11.]

95
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:12,259
[The Brown Bomber, number 11,
who took the world of soccer by a storm.]

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,559
[That number 11 will
once again fly on the field...]

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,890
[With a new legend, number 7.]

98
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,961
I will now explain
your Dream Cup mission to you.

99
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,920
The Dream Cup race today will be
carried out a bit differently

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,030
than what you have seen
the past two previous years.

101
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:35,789
In a few hours, the game against
Indonesia's representative soccer team

102
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,926
will take place on this field.

103
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:41,234
You will each be given a mission to carry out
during the Dream Cup game.

104
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,745
You just have to succeed the mission
that you've been given.

105
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,847
- It's simple as that.
- During the game?

106
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,507
- Yes, during the game.
- During the game!

107
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:51,441
If Park Ji Sung had to delegate the positions
which the Running Man members would play

108
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:54,311
then which position out on the field
would you assign to the members?

109
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:59,641
Based on our current situation,
I'd assign the wing position to them.

110
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,641
That's the toughest position!

111
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:06,801
- One wing position, and a shadow striker.
- Okay, I like shadow striker.

112
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,564
- I think a shadow striker would be good.
- How about a one-top position?

113
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,782
If one of you were put in
that position...

114
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,784
then I can 100% guarantee
that we'd lose the game.

115
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,344
Wow, Ji Sung normally wouldn't say
something like that.

116
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,164
He says he can guarantee it.

117
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,783
Since Park Ji Sung is the captain
of the Running Man team

118
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,168
he will also have a mission
of his own to carry out.

119
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,182
Park Ji Sung's mission is to score a total
of three goals during the game.

120
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:29,090
[Captain Park's mission-
Score a total of three goals.]

121
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,540
- And also do a hat trick while playing.
- Wait.

122
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:36,808
I've never once done a hat trick
during a game soccer.

123
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,430
- Then you can do it today.
- Today will be your first time.

124
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:42,202
- That's going to be so fun to watch!
- His first and last hat trick during a game.

125
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,799
Was it the game against Malaysia years ago
that Coach Cha played in?

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,078
You know the game where he scored
four points within the first seven minutes.

127
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,239
No, it was three goals
within the first five minutes.

128
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,381
But it's pretty much the same thing.
Four in seven minutes or three in five.

129
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,479
Coach Cha, don't you think that
you could probably do that again?

130
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,457
Look at him!
Did you just see his reaction?

131
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,785
How do you expect us to
carry out these types of missions?

132
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,763
I heard that our opponents
are really formidable.

133
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:12,077
I heard that they're the most formidable
team we've yet to face in these games.

134
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:16,524
The opposing that we'll be playing today
isn't a team made up of some amateurs.

135
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:22,203
They're all players who are respected to be
the best of the best soccer players.

136
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,203
To be honest, scoring even just two goals
would still be quite a feat.

137
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,723
- Yes, let's settle for two.
- I think two is a good number.

138
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,122
[Through Cha Boom's negotiations,
they settle on two goals.]

139
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:37,967
And although we don't know which
one of you will be playing in the game

140
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:41,187
but in the case of either Song Ji Hyo
or Ji Suk Jin playing in the game...

141
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,122
Let's let Ji Hyo's mission be
not falling asleep out on the field.

142
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:47,389
Their mission will be to get in touch with
the ball at least five times within the game.

143
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,209
But that's way too easy!

144
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:54,771
Then are they allowed to kick the ball around
five times once they have it for the mission?

145
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:57,478
- No, five different times.
- Ah, get it five times from other players?

146
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,925
[Not an easy mission to succeed
for first time participants.]

147
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,794
Then I guess I won't pass them the ball.

148
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,958
[Please, Ji Sung...]

149
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:11,225
Other than the players already mentioned,
everyone else who's already played before...

150
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:15,827
Yoo Jae Suk, Lee Kwang Soo,
Ha Ha, Kim Jong Kook and Gary...

151
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,507
Since you've had the experience of being
out on the field already

152
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:21,563
and have experienced the cheer of
the fans from the stands...

153
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:24,573
I believe that you will be able to play
with confidence and ease this time.

154
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,961
With that thought in mind, you
each have to score a forward point.

155
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:31,329
- What do you mean by that?
- You either have to assist or score a goal.

156
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,183
We have to either assist or score a goal?

157
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,811
Then if Jong Kook assists Gary,
and Gary scores, then they both succeed?

158
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,514
That's never going to happen.

159
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:42,915
[Just as the game states,
that's just a dream.]

160
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,463
- We can give it a try.
- Just pass the ball to each other.

161
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,012
Think of everyone else as our opponents.

162
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,840
If I don't let them out on the field,
then they all fail the mission?

163
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,134
- Yes, if you don't let them out on the field.
- Yes, then they all fail the mission?

164
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,996
[If they don't make it out on the field,
then they automatically fail the mission.]

165
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:56,401
- Why are you even saying that?
- Just in case I don't succeed my own mission.

166
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,148
If I feel that I may not get to
succeed my own mission.

167
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:02,556
Coach Cha,
you believe that it's possible, right?

168
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:05,348
I think the die has already
been rolled out.

169
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:08,406
I don't think there's any way for us
to avoid the inevitable.

170
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,334
The most important thing for any player
to have is self-confidence.

171
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,490
Yes, you're right.

172
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,284
Even if it doesn't quite work out,
you still have to play with confidence.

173
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,028
- We can do it!
- We're going to think positively.

174
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,026
You've all learned a lesson from me.

175
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,168
I feel very confident.

176
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:29,416
I would like for everyone to play with
confidence and show what you can do.

177
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,670
- Yes, we understand.
- We won't disappoint you!

178
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:33,936
- We will show you what we can do.
- We will show you with our actions.

179
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:36,286
- I will be watching all of you.
- Let's give a round of applause!

180
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,926
[Time for the spectators
to enter the stadium.]

181
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:58,307
[The stadium fills up with over
60,000 spectators.]

182
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:00,346
[Dressing room.]

183
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,342
[Italy's legendary defensive player-
Jean Luca Zambrotta.]

184
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:12,202
[Italy's newest ace- Stefan El Shara.]

185
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:17,256
[First, it's time for some pictures.]

186
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:24,102
[Reunites with a familiar face.]

187
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,314
Please help me score a goal.

188
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:28,947
I'll help you to the best of my abilities
so that you don't have to pay a penalty.

189
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,451
- You two won't get to play together.
- Ji Sung, wait!

190
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,590
[Twins Gae and Jung.]

191
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,030
I can make it so that none of you
get to go out on the field.

192
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,390
[Immediately apologizes.]

193
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,108
Coach Cha, you're here!

194
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:47,212
Coach Cha, you're here!
You should change into your uniform.

195
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,061
Everyone get up on your feet!

196
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,600
<i>Cha Boom!</i>

197
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,616
[Wow, Cha Boom is here?]

198
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,389
Hey, Mr. Jam.
My teacher.

199
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,031
He's my teacher.

200
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:06,451
[The world star soccer players pays
their respect to their legendary senior.]

201
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,670
- Your uniform is right here.
- It's right here.

202
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,370
You really expect me to wear this?

203
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,282
Ji Hyo's right here.

204
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,258
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Coach Cha is right over there.

205
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,895
[Ji Hyo's ready to go out onto the field.]

206
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,364
Coach Cha, you're in your uniform too.
Wow!

207
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:29,938
I have to dress the part
as your coach.

208
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,691
Ji Hyo's here.
Hi, Mr. Jam.

209
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,522
This is my sister.

210
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,126
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Wow, I've never seen him smile before.

211
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,154
I can't believe that he's actually smiling.

212
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,695
This is the first time I've ever seen him
smile like that.

213
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,890
[Wow, she's so beautiful.]

214
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:51,154
There's been a change to the list of players.

215
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,002
- What kind of a change?
- One of the RM members will be starting.

216
00:12:56,322 --> 00:13:00,084
[Kwang Soo is chosen to stand
in the starting line.]

217

- Please think about it one more time.
- Lee Kwang Soo!

218
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:04,154
Please stop him from doing this to me!

219
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:07,214
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- Why are you suddenly acting so scared?

220
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:10,715
- But I'm just not ready for this yet!
- What are you talking about?

221
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,250
How can a player facing a match
not be prepared to play?

222
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:20,262
How can a player who's about to play in
a match say that he's not ready?

223
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,139
I can be prepared to play
by the start of the second half.

224
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,773
What did you say to me earlier?
You said you wouldn't disappoint me.

[Where did the confident Giraffe
from earlier go?]

226
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,806
- Or you can just not play at all.
- No, I'll play!

227
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:33,650
[Giraffe comes to his senses from
one stern warning from Cha Boom.]

228

[Time for everyone to become one
and bring each other's dreams alive.]

be a game of everlasting memories.

make his entrance from the bench.]

248
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:38,523

a face full of humiliation.]

249

special training...]

250

- They wouldn't give you the ball, would they?
- They were a bit ruthless today.

312
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:26,459
- That's because it's a tight competition.
- It's because of their formidable opponents.

00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,731
I wouldn't have played it like that
had I been in the game.

322
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,928
- Be quiet.
- You wouldn't have even gone near it.

323
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:13,792
Suk Jin, it's your turn to go in.

324
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:19,408
[The time has come!
Big-nose's first time in the game.]

325
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,291
Good luck, Suk Jin.

326
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:30,502
[A look full of worry.]

327
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,824
My heart is pounding in my chest.

328
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:42,182
[Even in the midst of his nervousness,
he still manages to greet his fans.]

329
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:45,360
<i>Ji Suk Jin!</i>

330
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,372
I'm so nervous right now.

331
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,004
Ugh, I'm so nervous.

332
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:00,811
- You're switching out Captain Park.
- What?

333
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,467
[Like a bolt of lightning.]

334
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,956
I'm supposed to take Ji Sung's place?

335
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,611
But Ji Sung has to stay in the game to
pass me the ball.

336
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:10,066
I can't take over Ji Sung's spot.

337
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:13,073
[First time playing in the Dream Cup-
Takes over the Captain's spot.]

338
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:22,955
Ji Sung is coming out?

339
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:26,339
[Since it's an unofficial player swap,
he can come back out onto the field.]

340
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:36,824
[Swap of the captains.
Captain Park- Captain Ji.]

341
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:39,753
He's totally dead!

342
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,041
[This is Captain Ji's time!]

343
00:23:56,837 --> 00:24:01,217
[Full of confidence!
Captain Ji!]

344
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:04,899
[Suk Jin's mission-
Touch the ball five times.]

345
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,521
I don't care who's watching, but Suk Jin
totally runs like a middle aged man.

346
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:14,521
[Looks like a middle aged man
playing neighborhood kickball.]

347
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:18,709
Hey, Suk Jin looks like he's trying to
flag down a cab.

348
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:26,833
[Taxi!]

349
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,422
[Please go towards the goal post!]

350
00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:31,417
Taxi!
Taxi!

351
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:36,022
[Captain Ji is desperately trying to
flag down the taxi ball.]

352
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:43,071
[Suk Jin's mission- Touch the ball five times.
Current count- Zero.]

353
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:52,329
[The soccer ball is way too fast for
Captain Ji to follow.]

354
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,951
[I will show you what I can do
as the captain!]

355
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:02,039
Suk Jin!

356
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,812
[Trying to figure out where to go.]

357
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,674
[Definitely too much for him.]

358
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:22,010
[Jung Dae Se comes out of nowhere
like a beacon of  light.]

359
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:26,750
[So close!]

360
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,514
[I have to touch the ball.]

361
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:38,826
[Zambrotta's long center ring kick.]

362
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,326
[Jung Dae Se scores his second goal!]

363
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,045
[What a great offensive player!]

364
00:25:57,688 --> 00:26:00,464
[Shares his joy
with the Running Man members.]

365
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:02,026
My brother!

366
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:07,446
He hasn't even been near the ball yet.

367
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,370
He's just wandering around
out on the field right now.

368
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:17,868
[He's showing us how one can still play
soccer even without a soccer ball.]

369
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:21,080
I hope that I'll get a chance to get
to the ball once I'm in the game.

370
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,538
[A very sad looking back.]

371
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,439
Suk Jin's done now.

372
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,513
His hand is already on his side now.

373
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:34,404
[Evidence of his battery having run out.]

374
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,494
[Moment before the first half is over,
the opposing team scores their first goal.]

375
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,736
I bet he's going to touch the ball now.

376
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,174
- He can touch the ball now.
- Oh no, the first half is all over!

377
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,348
[Ball touch count- One.]

378
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:05,578
[Captain Ji- Penalty guaranteed.]

379
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,785
[Halftime after the end of first half.]

380
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:13,382
[Giraffe- Having played hard in the game.]

381
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,777
I want to get back out there.

382
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,971
[The Prince of off-sides,
Captain Ji.]

383
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,894
- Everything just happens so fast.
- Do you know what it felt like out there?

384
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:28,029
I noticed that I was always off to the side
whenever the other team was on the offense.

385
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,792
So I'd run to chase after the ball

386
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,782
but by the time I'd get there,
the ball would already be on the other side.

387
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,214
[Always running in the opposite direction
of the ball.]

388
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:38,926
There's no such thing as 'off-side'
in neighborhood soccer.

389
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:42,557
No, there is no such thing.

390
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:45,802
[Dream Cup Game- Second Half.]

391
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:56,196
[I'll be going out there
during the second half...]

392
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,160
[Gary takes it upon himself
to start warming up for his entrance.]

393
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:18,099
[Cha Boom's vote of confidence
in Gary's skills.]

394
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,063
[Stretching]

395
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,589
[Monday Couple even helps
each other stretch out!]

396
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,019
[Looking back...]

397
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:41,764
[Gary's first Dream Cup appearance
was two years ago...]

398
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,856
[But he was full of mistakes.]

399
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,410
[He had to console himself with
just having been part of the game.]

400
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:53,429
[Will he show the world a different
side to him this time?]

401
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,731
[Go get them, Gary!]

402
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,596
- Get the ball!
- There he goes!

403
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:18,135
[The ball is passed directly over to Gary!]

404
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,979
[A low and speedy pass!]

405
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,480
[Nice course!]

406
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,297
[If the ball makes it in the goal,
then Gary succeeds his mission!]

407
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,652
[Really?]

408
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:50,607
[Goal... so close!]

409
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,319
[By the split of a hair!]

410
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:03,054
[Mission- Score a forward point.
Gary could've assisted in a goal!]

411
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,651
He almost had it!
It almost made it in!

412
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,532
[That's my boy.]

413
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,283
<i>- Gary, cross kicks!
- Okay, Gary!</i>

414
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:21,583
<i>- Shoot!
- Gary almost had a goal assist.]</i>

415
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:24,004
<i>That could've been a great assist.</i>

416
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,317
<i>Even Davao just gave Gary
a thumbs up.</i>

417
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,869
<i>Of all the Running Man members
we've seen so far</i>

418
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,010
<i>I'm getting the best feeling
from Gary.</i>

419
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:35,237
[Great job, Gary!]

420
00:30:37,818 --> 00:30:42,475
[Haroro's turn to step out onto the
dream field in place of Jung Dae Se.]

421
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:46,901
Go up front!

422
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:56,885
[Haroro is running with all his might.]

423
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,849
Cut him off!
Cut him off in the middle!

424
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,896
[A dance instructor's pose.]

425
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:17,915
Ha Dong Hoon, fighting!

426
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:22,178
[Full of energy and vigor-
Straight on ahead!]

427
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,076
[Shoved out of the way.]

428
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,618
That's what we look like
most of the time.

429
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:34,108
- That's not just Ha Ha, but that's all of us.
- That's our natural form.

430
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,084
How like you that was, Ha Ha.

431
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,107
[That's so like you.]

432
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,286
[Team JS on the offense.]

433
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,154
[Kicks the ball over to Gary.]

434
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:51,696
[Wow!]

435
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,016
<i>This is the stance you should take
when you're either passing or dribbling.</i>

436
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:02,784
<i>- Yes, that's very good.
- He's good.</i>

437
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,664
[Gary showing off his best
duck butt moves.]

438
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,084
[And...]

439
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,306
[Gary's butt kicks into gear in Indonesia!]

440
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,825
[With a professional soccer player
as his opponent!]

441
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:27,252
[Gary-butt isn't letting his opponent
steal the ball away from him!]

442
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,712
That was great.

443
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,600
Jong Kook, get ready to go in.

444
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,542
[Time for Running Man's Ace to go in!]

445
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,936
Kim Jong Kook, fighting!

446
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,932
[Jong Kook has the honor of playing in
the game for the third year in a row.]

447
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:08,077
[Swaps Gary out.]

448
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:16,121
You did great.

449
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:19,013
- You almost had a goal assist.
- Ugh, I was so close!

450
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:23,408
[Even though he was so close,
he still failed to succeed his mission.]

451
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,863
[Team JS' offense.]

452
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,075
[Haroro kicks the ball to the center.]

453
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,103
[A super save!]

454
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,943
Fighting!

455
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,415
Kim Jong Kook, fighting!

456
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,420
[Jong Kook shows off his team playing skills.]

457
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:59,227
- That's it! That's good!
- Good!

458
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:00,937
Jong Kook's doing well.

459
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,387
[A kick resembling that
of a professional player.]

460
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,884
- Good job!
- He must know his way around a soccer ball.

461
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,856
- He's changed a lot since last year.
- This is all thanks to you, Coach Cha!

462
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,758
[Playing with determination.]

463
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:28,064
- He's totally different from last year.
- What has he been doing this past year?

464
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:31,305
[Other than when you were filming the show,
have you only been practicing soccer?]

465
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:34,718
Jae Suk, it's time for you to go in.

466
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,970
You want me to go in the game?

467
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,424
Good luck.

468
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,942
I'll be back, Coach Cha.

469
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:48,650
[Jae Suk is off to study soccer
abroad out on the field.]

470
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:58,090
Don't make another mistake
like you did last year.

471
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:04,113
[Last year's Dream Cup game- The nightmare
of having missed the penalty kick.]

472
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,697
I'm so nervous that I think
I need to go use the bathroom.

473
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,274
I wasn't nervous at all earlier.

474
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,125
[But now that the moment has come...]

475
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,903
I borrowed Kwang Soo's contact lenses.

476
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:18,913
[He even borrowed Kwang Soo's
contact lenses!]

477
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,163
So I guess you can't use the excuse of not
having been able to see this time around.

478
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,223
Why do you keep saying
things like that to me?

479
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:26,372
I'm seriously going to go out there
and score a goal.

480
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,094
[Swaps Haroro out- Out to hunt down his
goal for second year in a row.]

481

[Ji Sung, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk
stand together on the dream field.]

483
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:04,609
[Captain Park attempts to pass
the ball over to Jae Suk.]

484
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:09,408
- Off side!
- Get over to the off side!

485
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,640
[Come on.]

486
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:21,714
[Jae Suk ran too far ahead of the ball.]

487
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,648
[Retreats back towards the ball.]

[At last...]

514
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:12,614
[The legendary Cha Bum Geun
steps onto the field once again.]

Cha Bum Geun will be playing together.</i>

[The mentor and the pupil,
20 years in the making.]

520
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:41,757

legendary players gets to play together.]

Never in all my life...

523
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:48,978

Cha Bum Geun play in a game like this.

524
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:54,405
[The two legends stand together as one.]

[If he had been just a bit quicker...]

538
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,890
That pass was spot on.

539
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:14,921
[An unbelievably accurate
and straight pass.]

540

He truly is a legend.

541
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,834
[Every offense move...
starts with Cha Boom.]

542
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,762
He's trying to give Jong Kook a chance.

[Jae Suk shoots the ball!]

548
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:09,822
[Ah... he unfortunately misses the goal.]

[That was so close!]

550
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:24,353
[His passes are in a class of their own.]

551
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,296
Wow, he really is set apart from others.

552
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,615
We're so different from last year's game.
We're actually doing really good.

553
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,328
We're actually really good.

554

555
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:47,328
[A lost ball.]

the whole atmosphere of the team.]

558
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,256
[Current score- Team JS and Friends: 2
vs Team All-star: 3]

559
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:13,274
Coach Cha needs his chance.

560
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,290
[Cha Boom makes a perfect pass.]

561
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,137
The way Coach Cha keeps passing the ball,
it's always so spot on and accurate.

562
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:24,418
[The ultimate legend,
blazing his trail out on the field.]

563
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:34,310
[A chance for the captain
to even out the score.]

564

[Honey!]

00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,698
[Ji Sung...]

566
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,602
[The ball unfortunately gets
blocked by opposing defensive player.]

567
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:04,556

00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:32,263
[Succeeds at faking his move.]

572
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,511
<i>Jong Kook!</i>

573
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:44,069
[A move equivalent to that of a pro!]

574
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:50,020
[The perfect opportunity!]

575
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:53,195
[If he scores this goal,
then he can tie the score!]

576
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,278
[If this goal makes it in, then
Jong Kook and Jae Suk both succeed!]

577
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:06,673
[Will they make history in RM Dream Cup
and make the goal with another's assist?]

578
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:11,721
[Will he make the goal?]

579
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,119
[Misses his footing!]

580
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:27,107
[How can this be!]

581
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,663
[Loses the perfect opportunity!]

582
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:37,121
[But his manners are still world class.]

583
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:40,149
He could've scored the goal
if he hadn't lost his footing.

584
00:45:41,098 --> 00:45:43,455
[Game over]

585
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:49,171
[Final score- Team JS and Friends: 2
vs Team All Stars: 3]

586
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:54,395
[Everyone gives a part of encouragement
to one another.]

587
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,174
[Exchanges their uniform with one another.]

588
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:10,505
[Thank you to all the Indonesian players
who played in the match with us!]

589
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:15,962
Captain.

590
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:22,682
[All the members unfortunately
fail each of their own missions.]

591
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:26,294
Can we do it again next year? Can
you give us one more chance next year?

592
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:28,904
- Give us one more chance next year.
- I'm only going to play soccer from now on.

593
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:31,132
- Just give us one more chance.
- Just let us play again next year.

594
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,000
[Please give us another chance, Captain.]

595
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,886
It was unbelievable to see you
out on the field, Coach Cha.

596
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:40,665
[To think that they got to see Cha Boom
playing out on the field in person!]

597
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,680
How do you feel about playing on
the same field as Cha Boom, Captain Park?

598
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:45,962
- Yeah, I want to hear how he felt.
- I never even dreamt that it was possible.

599
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:50,536
It was truly an honor to have been given
the chance to play with him tonight.

600
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:54,024
When I received my trophy from Coach Cha
as a little kid back in elementary school

601
00:46:54,025 --> 00:46:56,306
he felt like a giant mountain that
I'd never be able to approach

602
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:59,623
and I realized today that there was a real
legitimate reason why I felt that way.

603
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,176
Just the fact alone that I was able to
play in a game tonight with Ji Sung

604
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:09,465
was not even fathomable to me before.

605
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:15,734
I'm just so thankful and grateful
for having been given this opportunity.

606
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:19,505
[Cha Bum Geun and Park Ji Sung-
Legends are forever.]

607
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:23,030
[For those who failed their mission...]

608
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:28,852
[It's time to face the wild.]

609
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:36,003
[Day Two in Indonesia-
An ominous morning approaches.]

610
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,396
What kind of a mission
are we going to be doing here?

611
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:43,213
- It's not a mission, but it's a penalty.
- Penalty? We're doing that right away?

612
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:46,202
Ah, I really could've avoided
having to pay any penalties.

613
00:47:46,203 --> 00:47:48,106
Keep in mind that I did kick
a ball towards the goal.

614
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:50,510
I made two shots.

615
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,443
- Can you guys not talk about soccer?
- Why?

616
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,488
- Can we just not talk about soccer?
- We're in big trouble today.

617
00:47:57,489 --> 00:48:01,180
- We're going to have to pay our penalties.
- What kind of a penalty is it going to be?

618
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:04,822
Not a single one of us succeeded
our mission last night.

619
00:48:04,823 --> 00:48:07,594
- No, we didn't.
- Is this a safari?

620
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:10,514
- It says that it's a safari over there.
- Oh, this is a safari?

621
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:14,250
[Their penalty... is at a safari?]

622
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:16,792
What kind of a penalty
is there going to be here?

623
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,814
- This is a safari?
- Wow, it's so huge.

624
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,502
[Welcome to the jungle.]

625
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:29,203
[Taman Safari- Largest safari in Indonesia for
animals in their natural rainforest habitat.]

626
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:33,945
[A wondrous world where 2,500 animals of
270 different species co-exists.]

627
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:44,474
[Free beasts of the wild-
What will they be made to do here?]

628
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,166
What do they have planned for us here?

629
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:53,248
Welcome to your second day here
in beautiful Indonesia.

630
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,672
- I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.
- Can we play another soccer match tonight?

631
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:00,626
- It was too much.
- I'd like to play again next year.

632
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:03,530
My body is getting more and more
used to the role of being a striker.

633
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,724
I think I'd be able to do
a better job next year.

634
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:09,602
Even though you all played so well
at the game last night

635
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:13,406
none of you were able to succeed
the personal mission given to you.

636
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:16,048
So you all have quite the penalty to face.

637
00:49:16,534 --> 00:49:20,212
Before you head off to do
your own penalty mission

638
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:23,284
we have prepared a small consolation game
which may exempt you from your penalty.

639
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,761
[Consolation for the losers in Safari.]

640
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,411
Why does everyone look so smug?
The penalties must be really stiff.

641
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:33,868
[No one...]

642
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:36,761
[Could even...]

643
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:40,831
[Have fathomed...]

644
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:45,840
[The stiffest penalty they've yet to face
for the 200th episode special.]

645
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,156
[Today's penalty-
Skydive from 10,000 feet in the air.]

646
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:53,310
[The head PD went through the experience
of the penalty himself.]

647
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:57,754
[A battle with one's self to
conquer the terrorizing fear.]

648
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:09,134
[Those who fail to carry out their safari
mission must become one with the sky.]

649
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:12,314
- Can you all guess where you are right now?
- We're at the safari.

650
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:17,643
This is a zoo of a massive scale that's set
right in the heart of the wild.

651
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,413
Your mission will be carried out
with the animals that exist in this habitat.

652
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,632
The mission you'll have to do will be sent to
the cellphone you have in your possession.

653
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:32,823
Whenever the name of a type of
an animal appears on your phone

654
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:37,708
you'll have to respond with your name to
the animal species you feel confident about.

655
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:41,494
For example, if the text says, Elephant,
then Yoo Jae Suk will respond with his name.

656
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:45,011
Thus the first person to respond with
their name will get to do that mission.

657
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:48,643
[Key is to respond before anyone else when
they see an animal they feel confident about.]

658
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:51,679
Since these missions involve animals,
there is no way for us to...

659
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:56,525
[Baby elephant's enthusiastic greeting.]

660
00:50:56,526 --> 00:50:58,612
[Welcome to the safari.]

661
00:50:58,613 --> 00:51:00,737
If you can successfully complete your safari
mission within thirty minutes

662
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,791
then you are excused
from the ultimate final penalty.

663
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,367
So the quicker we finish the mission,
then better it is for us?

664
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:07,377
- Okay, let's get started.
- What if we make a typo?

665
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,553
We will not accept a typo.
If you make a typo, then it won't count.

666
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:12,179
- Okay, we understand.
- Let's do this.

667
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:14,607
Okay, here we go.

668
00:51:15,503 --> 00:51:16,802
What is it?

669
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:19,289
Tiger?

670
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:27,748
[The same species as Tiger Kkuk?]

671
00:51:27,749 --> 00:51:30,505
- I'm not going. No way I'm going.
- It's a tiger.

672
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:31,513
[Everyone turns down the tiger.]

673
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:34,430
[Everyone's fingers are frozen in place.]

674
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:37,757
Ha Ha?
You're taking the tiger?

675
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:43,564
[Ha Ha... good luck.]

676
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:45,770
No, I didn't do it.
It really wasn't me.

677
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,493
I sent both of those texts.

678
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:49,772
I sent both Ha Ha and Jong Kook's name.

679
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:52,547
- I sent in Ha Ha's name.
- Shouldn't I have had to respond myself?

680
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:55,485
- Congratulations, Ha Ha. You got the tiger.
- Congratulations, Ha Ha.

681
00:51:55,486 --> 00:51:57,780
[How in the world!]

682
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,261
But I didn't do it.
Someone else can't sign for me.

683
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:02,439
[Nice... as long as it's not me.]

684
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:07,090
- It could be a very simple mission.
- But they're not going to put you in danger.

685
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:09,049
I bet you're going to have to play
some sort of a kissing game with the tiger.

686
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:13,389
[Wait and see what sort of an unforgettable
memory you'll be making with the tiger.]

687
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,933
[What will be the second animal?]

688
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,759
A deer!

689
00:52:20,047 --> 00:52:23,481
[A gentle deer-
Everyone's fingers start to fly around.]

690
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:30,528
[Deer mission- Captain Park.]

691
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:34,933
- Yes!
- Hey, what's this 'Deer Kwang Seun'?

692
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:36,470
[Kwang Soo's typo.]

693
00:52:38,204 --> 00:52:39,750
- An alligator?
- It's an alligator.

694
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,287
It's an alligator!

695
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,391
[Wow, that's coming out strong!]

696
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,543
No, I didn't do it!

697
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:52,269
[Kkuk signs Kwang Soo up
for this particular mission.]

698
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,211
- The alligator mission is Kwang Soo's.
- Nice!

699
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:59,647
I think I know what it's going to be.
Stick your head in the alligator's mouth.

700
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:01,971
- No, there's no way.
- Keep your head in the mouth for 5 seconds.

701
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:06,767
I can't do the snake.
I seriously can't even touch the snake.

702
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:09,968
I can't even touch it with my finger.
Snake, Jong Kook?

703
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,683
- Snake Gary.
- Who did that!

704
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:17,928
[Blank Ji looking after her
Monday boyfriend.]

705
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:20,381
Why are you doing this to me!

706
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:22,393
[Snake mission- Gary.]

707
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:26,226
Hey, flower snake! (a.k.a. Gold digger)
I already have a snake of my own here!

708
00:53:27,695 --> 00:53:29,991
- We'll get started with you two first.
- Okay.

709
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:33,817
[Tiger Ha Ha and Deer Captain Park
to head off into the safari first.]

710
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm so scared.
A tiger? I'm going to lose my mind.

711
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:39,074
How did I end up with the tiger?

712
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:43,524
- Which one of these do we take?
- You'll personally drive this car.

713
00:53:43,525 --> 00:53:45,600
We have to drive ourselves?
Are we going in the same car?

714
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:48,298
I'm personally going to drive the car?

715
00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:52,261
[Special feature of the Taman Safari is the
experience of driving themselves around.]

716
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,967
How in the world am I going to do
a tiger mission?

717
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:58,278
I'm seriously going to lose my mind.
A tiger!

718
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,332
I'm going to lose my mind.
Seriously, a tiger?

719
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,295
Ugh, that Lee Kwang Soo!
But a tiger may not be so bad.

720
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,500
Lion, alligator...
they're all pretty much the same.

721
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,705
Let's just go.
I can't do a snake either.

722
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:11,913
There's not a single thing that
I can do in this place.

723
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,449
If it's a safari...

724
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:16,389
then we're driving through areas
where the animals roam free?

725
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,582
I feel like I'm going to have to drive
to where all the wild beasts are.

726
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,813
- It's a baby zoo.
- Baby zoo can't be that bad.

727
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:24,466
Don't you think that it'll be safer here?

728
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:42,608
I wonder if the tiger slept well last night.
I hope that he's in a good mood.

729
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:47,584
Wow, we're already in the thick
of the jungle.

730
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,774
[Safari Adventure!]

731
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:58,539
[In the thick of the wild...
into the heart of the jungle.]

732
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,280
- You may stop the car now.
- What?

733
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:03,216
It's time for your mission.

734
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,416
[Ha Ha's tiger mission.]

735
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,849
<i>[Take a picture of yourself which also
shows the tiger's full frontal features.]</i>

736
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,659
That's just absurd!
How can I take a selca with a tiger?

737
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,949
What if in my attempt to take the picture...

738
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:19,509
I could end up losing my head!

739
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:28,840
[You want me to take a picture of myself
with this fearsome beast?]

740
00:55:28,841 --> 00:55:31,134
Just keep the doors locked
and take the picture from the car.

741
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,021
- Ah, from inside the car?
- Yes.

742
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:36,895
- So I'm going to stay in the car?
- Yes, take the picture from inside the car.

743
00:55:36,896 --> 00:55:38,984
I'm so relieved to hear that.

744
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,315
[Tears of relief.]

745
00:55:41,536 --> 00:55:43,290
Okay, everyone shut your doors.

746
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,073
And roll up all your windows.

747
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:47,806
Lock all your doors too.
Okay, we're all set!

748
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:50,175
No, this is just fine.
Whew!

749
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:53,849
[In a much better mood!
Now off to start the real safari tour.]

750
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,541
Look, there's a hippo.
I've never seen a hippo up close like this.

751
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:04,743
Hey, hippo!

752
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,675
Hi, hippo.

753
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:08,499
[Can you throw me something to eat?]

754
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,245
Wow, I've never seen these animals
so close up like this before.

755
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:14,585
[First time seeing these wild beasts
up close in person.]

756
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:16,947
Wow, they must be the baby hippos.
They're so cute.

757
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:19,819
If we jump over that ridge,
then we'll be able to touch those hippos.

758
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:23,207
Look!
It's a camel!

759
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:29,698
Wow, look at them!
They're just freely roaming around.

760
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:32,186
[What's that loud mouthed penguin
doing here?]

761
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,896
This really is a safari.

762
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:38,808
Wow!
That's a rhino over there!

763
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:42,098
Wow, that's big enough to
send our car flying into the air.

764
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:48,562
Look, it's a deer!
They're headed our way!

765
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:51,693
[Animals are walking right past all the cars.]

766
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:53,648
They're all just freely roaming around here.

767
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:56,366
If that had been a tiger,
I don't think I could've taken the picture.

768
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:59,146
What am I going to do?
The deers are right over here.

769
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:03,470
Oh my goodness.

770
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:06,674
[Totally fascinated.]

771
00:57:07,072 --> 00:57:09,117
Wow, look at this!
What if it kicks our car?

772
00:57:09,118 --> 00:57:11,680
Wow, this is unreal.

773
00:57:13,503 --> 00:57:20,771
[Deer mission- Captain Park.
Discovers a group of deer.]

774
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:22,576
Aren't those deer over there?

775
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:25,996
- Park Ji Sung, here's your deer mission.
- Okay.

776
00:57:25,997 --> 00:57:27,510
[Park Ji Sung's deer mission.]

777
00:57:28,315 --> 00:57:34,280
<i>[Take a picture of yourself with
a deer and also a zebra from the car.]</i>

778
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:38,009
What other animals do you see listed
on the card besides the deers?

779
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,441
Zebras.

780
00:57:39,442 --> 00:57:41,210
- The deer are in this area.
- Okay.

781
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:45,196
And in order to find the zebras,
you have to drive past the wild beast zone.

782
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:48,718
<i>You have to drive past the
wild beast zone...</i>

783
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,751
[You're telling me that I have to
drive past these guys?]

784
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:01,376
But there was no mention
of any zebras before.

785
00:58:01,932 --> 00:58:03,855
You can't do this to me now!

786
00:58:04,354 --> 00:58:05,902
That's just a guarantee...

787
00:58:06,126 --> 00:58:07,798
I have to take a selca?
(Selca= A picture of yourself.)

788
00:58:08,097 --> 00:58:10,996
[Captain Park immediately makes an attempt
to carry out his mission.]

789
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:13,163
Hey, deer!
Come over here.

790
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:16,334
[Tries to engage the deer in a conversation.]

791
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:18,161
I'm for sure going to fail this mission.

792
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,565
[What is he babbling about?]

793
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:22,134
Can you guys get up from over there?

794
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,460
Come here!

795
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:25,870
Hi!

796
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,660
Come here.

797
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:32,806
All these deer...
I think these are all just baby deer.

798
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:35,534
[He only sees small baby deer.]

799
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,502
I need to go look for some bigger deer.
Bye guys!

800
00:58:37,779 --> 00:58:40,084
You guys are too little,
so I don't think you guys will work.

801
00:58:40,728 --> 00:58:43,235
I'll be back some other time.
Bye!

802
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:46,911
Wow, all these deer.

803
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:50,322
This mission is too much.

804
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,282
But you were happy about
having picked the deer mission.

805
00:58:54,283 --> 00:58:55,665
Yes, I'm fine.

806
00:58:55,666 --> 00:59:00,552
If I fail the mission,
then I'll just pay the penalty for it.

807
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:02,161
Just to warn you,
it's our 200th episode special penalty.

808
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:07,619
[200th episode...
A penalty like you've never seen before.]

809
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,780
Yes, 200th episode special penalty.

810
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:11,459
[Unaware of what the penalty is,
but he's getting a bad feeling about it.]

811

[Meanwhile, Kwang Soo arrives
in the alligator zone.]

812
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:23,876
What is this?

813
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:26,337
Why is that guy missing his head?

814
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:30,405
[It's just a special photo zone to
create an optical illusion...]

815
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,290
It's a real alligator!

816
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:39,857
[A real alligator!]

817
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:46,630
[A terrifying visual-
A fierce looking herd of alligators.]

818
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:53,052
[Mental stupor]

819
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,136
What is he doing over there?

820
00:59:56,137 --> 01:00:00,549
[But... what is he doing over there?]

821
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,971
[Why is he tying a ribbon
onto an alligator's tail?]

822
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,380
Are you okay?

823
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:14,415
[This portion of the show was filmed under
the supervision of trained professionals.]

824
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:19,601
It's a real alligator.

825
01:00:19,602 --> 01:00:22,491
[Such a frightening visual that all he can
do is repeat that they're real alligators.]

826
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:25,485
[Welcome, Giraffe.]

827
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:32,316
<i>Succeed the mission by untying the ribbon
that's tied around the alligator's tail.</i>

828
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:39,721
[Why... are you doing this to me?]

829
01:00:39,722 --> 01:00:41,710
<i>It's a very gentle alligator.</i>

830
01:00:41,711 --> 01:00:44,467
How do you know if that
alligator is gentle or not?

831
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:47,116
[Gentle?]

832
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,677
<i>They're nice animals.</i>

833
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,734
How do you know if he's nice or not?

834
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:54,140
What if he's in a bad mood today?

835
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:56,138
What if it got into trouble
with its mother yesterday?

836
01:00:58,103 --> 01:01:00,057
What if he got into a fight
with his girlfriend yesterday?

837
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,479
[I live a celibate life.]

838
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:06,451
It's moving!

839
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,341
[That's because he's alive.]

840
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:14,229
This is a real crocodile!

841
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:17,115
Very nice.

842
01:01:18,248 --> 01:01:20,691
- Want to come?
- He's not a doll?

843
01:01:22,385 --> 01:01:24,601
- Is it a real crocodile?
- Yes.

844
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:27,507
[Just accept your reality.]

845
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:32,197
[I won't cause you any trouble.]

846
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:34,195
No crocodile?

847
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:35,963
- No crocodile?
- No, don't worry.

848
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:44,007
Wow, look at my goosebumps.

849
01:01:45,613 --> 01:01:48,377
It's staring at me.
It's staring at me right now.

850
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,921
[Meanwhile, while Kwang Soo is starting to
have a mental breakdown in alligator zone...]

851
01:01:56,525 --> 01:02:00,675
[Seal mission- Ji Hyo.
What does her mission entail?]

852
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,003
What's this?

853
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:08,819
[Jump!]

854
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:12,505
[Flies out of the water
like a bolt of lightning...]

855
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:15,327
[and grabs the fish out of
the trainer's mouth.]

856
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:19,015
[Oh my God!]

857
01:02:19,577 --> 01:02:24,879
[The seal mission that she thought
was going to be easy...]

858
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,053
You're telling me that I need to do
what he just did?

859
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,954
Okay.

860
01:02:32,955 --> 01:02:37,697
[Okay, seal, let's do this.]

861
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,311
Name?

862
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:43,958
Hiromi?
Hiromi!

863
01:02:44,753 --> 01:02:46,975
[First introduces herself to Hiromi.]

864
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,962
Hi.

865
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,894
Hiromi, give me a kiss.

866
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:58,039
[I like this girl.]

867
01:02:58,719 --> 01:02:59,882
Hiromi.

868
01:02:59,883 --> 01:03:01,876
Would you like to dance with me?

869
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:04,056
[Asks Hiromi for a dance.]

870
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:09,168
[Oh!]

871
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:12,000
[Succeeds on her first attempt!]

872
01:03:13,385 --> 01:03:17,663
[Blank Ji immediately earns the trust
and affection of shy Hiromi.]

873
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,352
Hiromi, I love you.

874
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:26,170
[Hiromi and Blank Ji's dance time.]

875
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:30,967

Ends the dance with a kiss on the cheek.]

876
01:03:33,218 --> 01:03:35,030
Thank you.
I love you.

877
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:42,533
[Greets Boto, whom she'll be doing
the fish feeding mission with.]

878
01:03:45,227 --> 01:03:47,494
Boto, it's just me.
It's just me, okay?

879
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:52,061
[Blank Ji starts to climb up the ladder
without an ounce of hesitation.]

880
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,835
[At the tippy top of the ladder.]

881
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:01,370
Boto.

882
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,254
Let's get this done on our first try.

883
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:08,903
Boto, fighting!

884
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:13,989
[Blank Ji signals the start of
the mission to Boto.]

885
01:04:16,631 --> 01:04:19,418
[Here he comes...]

886
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:31,041
[Boto flies straight into
the air like a bullet.]

887
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:34,083
[Will Blank Ji succeed her mission?]

888
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,898
This sounds like a pretty fun mission.

889
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:40,365
Look at him yawning.
How cute are you!

890

with the orangutan.]

891

- Chelsea.
- Chelsea?

892
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:47,337
Oh, Chelsea.
Hi, Chelsea.

893
01:04:47,338 --> 01:04:50,293
- How old?
- She's four years old.

894
01:04:50,294 --> 01:04:52,752
- Four? Okay, four.
- She's four years old.

895
01:04:52,753 --> 01:04:54,598
[Four year old orangutan, Chelsea.]

896
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:00,317
She's like a little baby.
She just jumped into my arms.

897
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,437
Chelsea.
Sweet Chelsea.

898

[Daddy Big-nose croons to Chelsea
as he would a baby.]

899

What are you eating?
What's that?

900
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:11,413
[When did she get the mic cover in her mouth?]

901
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,681
That's my mic.
No, you can't eat that.

902
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,369
That's for my mic.

903
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,632
You can't eat that.
That's dangerous for you to eat.

904

It's dangerous for you to eat that.
Want to do some jump rope?

905
01:05:21,706 --> 01:05:22,845
Jump rope.

906

one of Chelsea's favorite activities.]

907

No, come over here, Chelsea.

908

what is going on.]

910

No, not that. That's not for you to eat.
Come here, Chelsea.

911

[He's actually worried that
an orangutan will fall off the post.]

917

Wow, I totally feel like
I'm chasing after a little kid.

No, you can't do that.
Don't do that.

921

Chelsea, come here.

922

in the cabinet!]

Here we go.

931

Please!
Come on, Chelsea.

933

Want some carrots?

946

[Captain Park tries to lure them over
with a bunch of carrots.]

947

Hey, guys?

948

You over there.
The one who looks like the king.

949
01:07:15,233 --> 01:07:18,147
You have to show some interest in these.
Don't you want to eat the carrots?

950
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,568
Guys.

951
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,221
Look, I've got carrots.

952
01:07:22,222 --> 01:07:24,052
Here, come and get these carrots.

953

[Just then... a deer shows some interest.]

954
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,655
No, you're way too short!

955
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:33,423
Do you think that you could climb up here?

956
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,161
Here, come eat your carrots.

957
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,447
I'll give you one.

958
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:41,231
You can eat this carrot
and lure other deer over here.

959
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:45,490
[Asks the deer to tell the others
how tasty the carrot is.]

960
01:07:45,735 --> 01:07:47,755
Hey, big kid.
Aren't you hungry?

961
01:07:47,756 --> 01:07:50,878
[But the one that Captain Park wants
is the king deer.]

962
01:07:51,593 --> 01:07:54,026
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
I really like you.

963
01:07:55,106 --> 01:07:57,084
Don't you want to try one of these?

964
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,629
[Captain Park is actually
quite the chatterbox.]

965
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,675
I've got delicious carrots for you.

966
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:04,235
You're too greedy.
Why are you eating so much?

967
01:08:04,236 --> 01:08:06,243
You need to share with your friends.

968
01:08:06,555 --> 01:08:10,553
[He's all of a sudden trying to teach
the deer some manners.]

969
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:12,075
I'll give you one too.

970
01:08:12,662 --> 01:08:14,415
These are delicious.

971
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:18,817
I need to get a bunch of them here
to get that big one's interest.

972
01:08:19,301 --> 01:08:21,214
Here, one for you too.
There you go.

973
01:08:21,215 --> 01:08:23,553
But why is it that only the little ones
are coming up to the car?

974
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:27,788
Can you get those guys over here?
I need those guys over here.

[Guys?]

976
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:31,415
You actually look rather big.
Come over here for a minute.

977
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:33,702
Yeah, I think you might be big enough.

978
01:08:33,703 --> 01:08:35,772
[Discovers a bigger sized deer.]

979
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:41,032
Can you stick your head out further?
Don't you want this? There you go.

980
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,940
A little bit more.
Put your feet up on the car.

981
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:45,703
Come on, use your head.

982
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:48,173
[Tries to convince the deer
into using its head.]

983
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:51,192
You're going to give up?
You're giving up on me right now?

984
01:08:52,618 --> 01:08:55,285
What are you so afraid of?
Here it is right here.

985
01:08:55,286 --> 01:08:59,626
[Psychologically challenging the deer
as if he's training his soccer juniors.]

986
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,345
You just tasted these yummy carrots, right?
Come and I'll give you more carrots.

987
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:05,275
We just need to take a picture together.

988
01:09:05,276 --> 01:09:07,713
Yeah, just a picture.
Come here.

989
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:09,480
Come here.
I just need a shot of your head.

990
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:11,455
Just a shot of your head.
Come on.

991
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:13,382
Here, try a taste of this.

992
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,562
I feel bad about teasing you
with this carrot too.

993
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:21,395
Can you try doing this with me?

994
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,855
You just need to stick your head in.
Can you come forward a little bit more?

995
01:09:25,597 --> 01:09:26,815
Here.

996
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:36,298
This isn't strong enough to withstand you.

997
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:38,069
Okay, just your head.

998
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,500
Okay, I just need your head.
A little bit more.

999
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,535
A little bit more.
Just a little bit more.

1000
01:09:45,665 --> 01:09:48,992
I just need to take a picture of us.
Do you not want to take a picture with me?

1001
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:53,078
You keep that up,
and you'll be licking my face next.

1002
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:56,391
Hey.

1003
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,747
It would've been easier to kiss the deer
for my mission.

1004
01:09:59,317 --> 01:10:01,114
Right?
There you go.

1005
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:04,663
Guys!
Don't you guys want some carrots?

1006
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:06,451
Here's a carrot.

1007
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,143
Come get your carrot.
You big kids over there.

1008
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:12,539
[Back to advertising his tasty carrots.]

1009
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:14,744
Hey, horns!

1010
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:16,551
Please, come here, horn.

1011
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:20,987
[Who keeps calling me?]

1012
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:23,593
The deer with the horns.

1013
01:10:23,881 --> 01:10:27,007
Can you please look at me?
I've got a carrot over here for you.

1014
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:32,008
I think I'm going to fail my mission.

1015
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:35,575
I shouldn't have picked the deer mission.

1016
01:10:38,028 --> 01:10:42,170
[Then are the other animals any better?]

1017
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:46,287
[Snake mission- Gary.]

1018
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:47,713
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

1019
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:50,278
<i>Think of myself as just another snake.</i>

1020
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,450
<i>I've always loved snakes.</i>

1021
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:54,374
<i>I've always been one with the snakes.</i>

1022
01:10:55,146 --> 01:10:57,530
<i>Relax.
It's all about mind control.</i>

1023
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:02,560
[His terrifying phobia of snakes-
A battle he must win against himself.]

1024
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:05,966
<i>I love snakes.</i>

1025
01:11:09,377 --> 01:11:11,368
<i>I've always slithered around
like a snake.</i>

1026
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,893
I... I've always loved snakes!

1027
01:11:15,894 --> 01:11:17,834
[His mind control flies out the window
as soon as he sees the snakes.]

1028
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:19,431
I love snakes!

1029
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:24,312
[Dance of the tongue in welcome.]

1030
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:30,146
What am I going to do!

1031
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:34,425
Is it dangerous?

1032
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:36,384
- No, not dangerous.
- No dangerous?

1033
01:11:36,385 --> 01:11:38,550
Really?
You're a liar!

1034
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:40,727
You're a liar.

1035
01:11:43,148 --> 01:11:45,087
- What's my mission?
- Here's your mission.

1036
01:11:45,088 --> 01:11:47,210
[What is Gary's snake mission?]

1037
01:11:47,211 --> 01:11:49,235
My hands are shaking so badly right now.

1038
01:11:49,236 --> 01:11:51,144
<i>Succeed the mission by
wrapping one snake around your waist</i>

1039
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:54,417
<i>and wrap another around your neck,
and kiss the snake wrapped around your neck.</i>

1040
01:11:55,419 --> 01:11:57,575
How do you expect me to kiss a snake!

1041
01:11:58,275 --> 01:12:02,514
[Doesn't everyone like kissing a snake?]

1042
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:04,234
How old is the snake?

1043
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:06,582
- It's four years old.
- Four years?

1044
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:09,012
- It's a baby?
- Yes, it's a baby.

1045
01:12:09,013 --> 01:12:10,834
Okay, a baby.
A baby?

1046
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:12,969
Baby, I'm Gary.

1047
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,858
We are friends, okay?

1048
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:19,391
I should try touching it first.

1049
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,779
It feels like there's something
on the underside.

1050
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:30,000
It's actually surprisingly soft.

1051
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,519
- Is it a cobra?
- No, it's nice.

1052
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,984
[It's a yellow python constrictor.]

1053
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:40,607
How do I do this?

1054
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:47,289
[I want to cry!]

1055
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:51,843
[There's another man who's close
to crying right at that moment.]

1056
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:56,147
[Sitting next to him...]

1057
01:12:56,148 --> 01:12:59,157
[is a lion king.]

1058
01:13:05,599 --> 01:13:12,362
[This is Taman Safari's hottest attraction-
Gets to take a picture with a real lion.]

1059
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,127
[With the exception of this one man.]

1060
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:30,423
Wait!

1061
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,009
Did you all just see that?

1062
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,668
[Even the divine Mr. Capable
can have that terrified look on his face.]

1063
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:37,504
He just opened his mouth at me.

1064
01:13:37,505 --> 01:13:40,728
He just... he just
opened his mouth at me.

1065
01:13:41,094 --> 01:13:42,904
[He's a bigger scaredy cat than he looks.]

1066
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,306
He's not dangerous.

1067
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,440
[Come on, Tiger.]

1068
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:59,302
[Jong Kook's lion mission-
Brush the lion's mane ten times.]

1069
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:05,410
Everyone!

1070
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:07,208
Everyone.

1071
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:09,882
That's just seriously...
That wasn't just a yawn.

1072
01:14:09,883 --> 01:14:13,210
Anyone who saw that would say...
What do you think of what just happened?

1073
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:15,402
He opened his mouth at me
as if he was ready to bite me.

1074
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:16,995
He was about to lunge for my hand.

1075
01:14:16,996 --> 01:14:19,348
- It looked like a yawn to me.
- How was that just a yawn?

1076
01:14:19,349 --> 01:14:21,851
[Even the camera PD's are on our side.]

1077
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:25,071
[Just trust me.]

1078
01:14:25,786 --> 01:14:27,000
I really thought...

1079
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:31,338
that this mission wasn't
going to be difficult.

1080
01:14:33,717 --> 01:14:34,859
I really thought that.

1081
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:37,243
[On the same token, there's
another bewildered man nearby.]

1082
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:39,624
Chelsea, why are you so strong?

1083
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:41,882
Chelsea.

1084
01:14:41,883 --> 01:14:43,198
Chelsea!

1085
01:14:48,754 --> 01:14:51,246
I'm highly sensitized right now.
I don't want anyone to make any moves.

1086
01:14:53,852 --> 01:14:56,822
[What's he doing?]

1087
01:14:58,698 --> 01:15:00,714
I think I need to disguise myself.

1088
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:05,334
[Bushman?]

1089
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,338
Do I look like a tree?

1090
01:15:08,941 --> 01:15:10,524
- Do I look like a tree?
- No.

1091
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:13,544
- No.
- No, you don't look like a tree.

1092
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:15,286
- They're asleep?
- Yeah.

1093
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:17,772
I should go untie the ribbon
while it's asleep.

1094
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:22,520
[Attempting to untie the ribbon from
the tail of a sleeping alligator.]

1095
01:15:40,206 --> 01:15:42,271
[Nerve wrecking moment.]

1096
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:47,596
[I've got my eye on you!]

1097
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,310
[The ribbon is in his hand!]

1098
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:15,884
[Or not.]

1099
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,657
[His hand isn't moving
like his mind wants him to.]

1100
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,756
[Just untie the ribbon already!]

1101
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:32,606
[Makes another attempt.]

1102
01:16:33,496 --> 01:16:37,358
[Succeeds at untying the knot.]

1103
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:41,794
[Now he just needs to pull it free!]

1104
01:16:43,798 --> 01:16:46,835
[A total of three ribbons to untie.
Succeeds at untying the first ribbon.]

1105
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:55,163
I feel really dizzy right now.

1106
01:16:57,382 --> 01:17:01,657
[Meanwhile...]

1107
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:07,813
[Haroro is so engrossed in the sights that
he's almost forgotten about his mission.]

1108
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:10,880
This is so amazing.

1109
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:18,311
[Slowly drives right past a real zebra.]

1110
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:20,667
I can't believe how close he was.

1111
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:23,367
That was a zebra.

1112
01:17:23,368 --> 01:17:27,567
Wow, it's unreal to see an animal like that
so up close like we did, isn't it?

1113
01:17:27,568 --> 01:17:29,357
I feel like I'm dreaming.

1114
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:32,509
This is crazy.

1115
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:38,677
[Finally arrives at the gates of
the wild beast zone.]

1116
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:43,479
Wow, I'm a little scared right now.

1117
01:17:46,999 --> 01:17:49,681
There are wild beasts in this area.
I should roll up my window.

1118
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:58,471
Wow, that's a lion!

1119
01:17:58,472 --> 01:18:02,313
Oh my gosh.
Did everyone lock up their doors?

1120
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:09,229
[Frozen in place.]

1121
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:15,803
[The king of the jungle-
The lion is sitting right in front of him!]

1122
01:18:15,804 --> 01:18:17,632
Don't look over at those guys.

1123
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:22,659
[The formidable force of the lions.]

1124
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,836
They're not dogs, they're real live lions.

1125
01:18:27,322 --> 01:18:32,126
[A huge herd of lions...
Right in front of his eyes!]

1126
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,762
I've never seen a lion
so up close like this before.

1127
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,234
I'm about to break out in hives.

1128
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:43,615
I have to be in this zone to
get a picture with a tiger, right?

1129
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,446
[Haroro is driving past these beasts
in a speedy pace.]

1130
01:18:48,802 --> 01:18:49,993
Oh my goodness!

1131
01:18:49,994 --> 01:18:51,760
They're all out in the open?

1132
01:18:52,293 --> 01:18:57,465
[The real experience of driving past the lions
that roam free without any boundaries.]

1133
01:18:59,172 --> 01:19:01,622
Are those guys gentle?

1134
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:11,057
[Haroro finally arrives
at entrance of the tigers' den.]

1135
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:16,805
Look, it's a tiger!

1136
01:19:18,565 --> 01:19:22,075
[It's a tiger!]

1137
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,931
[Full of frightening charisma.]

1138
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,647
It's a real live tiger.

1139
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:34,617
There's a real live tiger
right in front of my eyes.

1140
01:19:35,236 --> 01:19:36,899
Wow, it's a real tiger!

1141
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:41,291
Hey, do you see that?
It's a real live tiger!

1142
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:45,938
Look, it's a snow tiger!

1143
01:19:48,153 --> 01:19:50,201
How am I going to take a selca
with that?

1144
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:54,489
It really is a tiger.

1145
01:19:54,551 --> 01:19:58,476
Wow, I'm just so fascinated that
I don't even feel any fear right now.

1146
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,668
Look at that tiger over there.

1147
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,824
Wow, there's another tiger
right in front of us.

1148
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:08,636
[A surreal experience that
one only dreams about.]

1149
01:20:09,882 --> 01:20:12,789
They won't come near the car
just like those deer.

1150
01:20:14,804 --> 01:20:17,639
[Who dares to come here!]

1151
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:21,415
There it is.

1152
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,893
[Tiger mission- Take a selca with
the tiger's face alongside of his own.]

1153
01:20:25,894 --> 01:20:27,173
No, don't go away.

1154
01:20:29,643 --> 01:20:31,951
I can't even really see.
How am I going to do this?

1155
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,973
[In order to succeed his mission,
he'll have to lure the tiger over to the car.]

1156
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:35,960
There it is!
It's coming closer.

1157
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,852
[The snow tiger is making its way
closer to the car!]

1158
01:20:43,017 --> 01:20:46,517
[The tigers are slowly starting to
surround Ha Ha's car.]

1159
01:20:52,486 --> 01:20:59,626
[Just then... the snow tiger starts
to approach even closer.]

1160
01:21:06,355 --> 01:21:09,667
[Right outside Ha Ha's window!]

1161
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,246
[All his fear dissipates!
Haroro lures it even closer to him!]

1162
01:21:24,753 --> 01:21:27,290
Even though I'm scared,
I'm not going to get flustered.

1163
01:21:44,662 --> 01:21:47,500
[Haroro is in the midst of a tiger field.]

1164
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:49,585
Snow tiger,
I came all the way here from Korea.

1165
01:21:49,586 --> 01:21:51,833
Do you know the friendly tiger
from our '88 Olympics?

1166
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,452
Hey, can you look towards me once more?
Wow, look at the size of his paws.

1167
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:58,985
Hey, look over here.

1168
01:21:58,986 --> 01:22:02,678
[Snow tiger slinks away
after his photo session.]

1169
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:04,956
All these pictures are a total success.
Look, this is a good one too.

1170
01:22:04,957 --> 01:22:08,881
[Verifying the pictures he took
of himself with the tiger.]

1171
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,810
Success... success...

1172
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:20,334
[Wow, a complete success!]

1173
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:23,218
- Ha Ha, you have succeeded your mission.
- Okay!

1174
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:25,914
[Ha Ha clears his tiger mission.
He is now exempt from final penalty.]

1175
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:27,436
Thanks so much!

1176
01:22:28,363 --> 01:22:32,070
[Thank you, Tiger!]

1177
01:22:34,252 --> 01:22:36,933
Wow, I never knew that I could be so brave.

1178
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:42,607
[Back to Ji Hyo
and her mission with the seals.]

1179
01:22:44,332 --> 01:22:49,998
[Will Boto be able to snatch the fish
from Blank Ji's mouth?]

1180
01:23:00,103 --> 01:23:02,744
[Boto was a little too short on his jump.]

1181
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,302
Should I bend down even further?

1182
01:23:04,303 --> 01:23:06,195
[Blank Ji has to bend a little further down.]

1183
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,366
Sorry, Boto.

1184
01:23:09,704 --> 01:23:11,622
Sorry, I'll just give it to you.

1185
01:23:16,722 --> 01:23:19,330
[Gets herself back in position, and
makes a second attempt at the mission.]

1186
01:23:25,364 --> 01:23:28,344
[An energetic jump.]

1187
01:23:28,345 --> 01:23:31,983
[Will he get it this time?]

1188
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:43,058
[Blank Ji and Boto- A perfect success!]

1189
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:44,782
[Even the trainer is impressed.]

1190
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,169
[A perfect harmony between
Blank Ji and Boto.]

1191
01:23:52,108 --> 01:23:54,342
Boto, I'll give you another fish.

1192
01:23:54,343 --> 01:23:55,463
Boto!

1193
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,388
[A fish treat in joy.]

1194
01:23:57,389 --> 01:23:59,064
I love you!

1195
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:05,191
[The Blank Ji Show now comes to a close.]

1196
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:12,734
<i>Song Ji Hyo always succeeds her mission.</i>

1197
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:17,480
Why are you doing the hoola hoop in
the eagle training zone?

1198
01:24:18,684 --> 01:24:20,989
I'm absolutely terrified right now, Ji Hyo.

1199
01:24:21,388 --> 01:24:24,530
Why do I have to do the hoola hoop
with the eagle sitting on my head?

1200
01:24:32,623 --> 01:24:38,661
[A majestic flight...
right onto the top of Yoo Hyuk's head.]

1201
01:24:41,635 --> 01:24:43,066
Hang on.

1202
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:47,293
[Must start doing the hoola hoop
before the eagle flies away.]

1203
01:24:47,911 --> 01:24:50,453
I'm sorry, but I need you to stay still.

1204
01:24:56,572 --> 01:24:58,730
[Ah... he only got one full swing
before the eagle flew away.]

1205
01:24:58,731 --> 01:25:01,592
That is one awful trainer out there.

1206
01:25:01,593 --> 01:25:05,490
- You just be quiet over there!
- Can we get a bigger eagle on his head?

1207
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:07,690
Seriously... please.

1208
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,014
Help me out just this once.

1209
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:12,684
- Help me out just this once.
- Can you use a larger sized eagle?

1210
01:25:12,685 --> 01:25:16,522
- You just be quiet. What are you doing?
- I saw a really big one over there.

1211
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,388
Eagle, he's not your food.
You can't snatch him away, okay?

1212
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:24,421
- Hey, you just be quiet!
- I wonder what Kwang Soo is up to.

1213
01:25:25,147 --> 01:25:27,630
- Have fun hoola hooping with the eagle.
- Seriously, that girl...

1214
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:35,160
[Takes another flight.]

1215
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:37,022
[A last minute U-turn.]

1216
01:25:41,778 --> 01:25:44,050
[This eagle is going to bring
the Grasshopper down to his knees.]

1217
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,650
I'm breaking out in cold sweat over here.

1218
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:47,474
My whole body is covered in cold sweat.

1219
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:52,748
Alligator, there's your food over there.

1220
01:25:52,749 --> 01:25:55,246
- Alligator, there's your food over there.
- Stop doing that and just go away!

1221
01:25:55,247 --> 01:25:57,184
- That's a giraffe!
- No, I'm not a giraffe!

1222
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:59,639
- Giraffe!
- No, seriously! Stop doing that, Ji Hyo.

1223
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,497
Seriously, stop doing that!
I have to get two more.

1224
01:26:04,163 --> 01:26:07,670
[Still has two more ribbons left to untie.]

1225
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:14,359
[Trying to untie the ribbon...]

1226
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,729
[While keeping a close eye on the alligator.]

1227
01:26:19,776 --> 01:26:22,411
[Using a stick to
pull the ribbon off the tail.]

1228
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:25,717
[He's got it!]

1229
01:26:25,718 --> 01:26:27,427
Hey, don't go over there!

1230
01:26:27,428 --> 01:26:31,508
No, don't go that way!
You have to go the other way!

1231
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:34,330
[Giraffe almost headed straight
toward another alligator!]

1232
01:26:34,331 --> 01:26:37,307
- That could've been big trouble.
- What were you thinking heading that way!

1233
01:26:38,349 --> 01:26:41,122
You should've come back this
way, you fool!

1234
01:26:41,123 --> 01:26:45,640
Anyways, good luck,
and don't go back to the other alligators.

1235
01:26:45,641 --> 01:26:47,573
- Okay.
- That was your second one?

1236
01:26:47,574 --> 01:26:49,857
- I just need to get one more.
- Good luck, Kwang Soo.

1237
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,635
Let's try to get this done, okay?

1238
01:26:53,636 --> 01:26:56,258
Okay, grab the ball.
Now throw it back to me.

1239
01:26:56,259 --> 01:26:58,835
No, it's not something for you to eat.
You're going to pop the ball!

1240
01:26:58,836 --> 01:27:00,969
Come on, that's the only ball we have.

1241
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:05,570
[Mission- Catch the ball that
the orangutan throws in his direction.]

1242
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:11,515
[Can never predict in which direction
the orangutan will throw the ball.]

1243
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:13,115
Are you playing with me right now?

1244
01:27:13,116 --> 01:27:14,921
Okay, look over here.

1245
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:17,565
[Another attempt.]

1246
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,280
Grab the ball.
There you go.

1247
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:21,120
Okay, there you go.
Now throw me the ball.

1248
01:27:21,121 --> 01:27:23,151
Stop teasing me and just
throw me the ball.

1249
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:25,663
No, no more teasing.
Throw it to me.

1250
01:27:25,664 --> 01:27:28,217
No, throw it gently.
Throw the ball!

1251
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:32,327
[Can never predict his throws.]

1252
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:34,315
He's seriously so smart.

1253
01:27:35,073 --> 01:27:38,107
How am I going to get this done?
Okay, let's try it again.

1254
01:27:38,108 --> 01:27:40,963
[These animals are unknowingly making
it very tough for all these members.]

1255
01:27:44,877 --> 01:27:48,441
[Gritting down on his teeth
to brush the mane ten times.]

1256
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:59,186
[That feels really nice.]

1257
01:27:59,187 --> 01:28:00,491
I did it.

1258
01:28:01,105 --> 01:28:04,083
[Kkuk succeeds his mission of
brushing the lion's mane ten times.]

1259
01:28:10,606 --> 01:28:12,665
Thank you.
I'm going to be going now.

1260
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:14,300
[Goodbye, Tiger.]

1261
01:28:17,483 --> 01:28:20,992
[Flustered Kkuk behaves strangely by climbing
over the fence instead of using the entrance.]

1262
01:28:21,776 --> 01:28:22,957
Bye.

1263
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:25,968
[Kkuk also escapes from having to
pay the ultimate penalty.]

1264
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,438
I love you.

1265
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,153
I've always loved you.

1266
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:44,443
Why isn't this one getting close to me?

1267
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,443
[But he's already past the point
of any mind control.]

1268
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:54,095
Come here.

1269
01:28:55,165 --> 01:28:56,282
Okay, I'm going to do it.

1270
01:28:56,283 --> 01:28:57,966
[Gary's kiss with a snake!]

1271
01:28:59,487 --> 01:29:00,698
I did it!

1272
01:29:01,152 --> 01:29:05,976
[Snake kiss... successfully passed!]

1273
01:29:05,977 --> 01:29:07,270
Hurry it get them off of me!

1274
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:10,286
I love you guys, and thanks.

1275
01:29:10,287 --> 01:29:13,109
[I love you, but please get away from me!]

1276
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:15,427
Please get it off of me right now!

1277
01:29:17,204 --> 01:29:20,124
[A playful snake trainer.]

1278
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,134
Thank you.
Thank you, snake.

1279
01:29:28,824 --> 01:29:32,878
Oh, my baby.
I feel much closer to it now.

1280
01:29:37,266 --> 01:29:39,217
I'm curious to know
what my penalty is going to be.

1281
01:29:39,977 --> 01:29:42,523
I'm already thinking of what my penalty is
going to be before the mission is even over.

1282
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:46,392
Zebras!
I finally found them!

1283
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:51,259
You guys are my last hope.

1284
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:56,383
I have delicious carrots for you guys.

1285
01:29:56,384 --> 01:29:59,304
[All movement is ceased.]

1286
01:30:00,023 --> 01:30:01,639
You're not a statue, are you?

1287
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:06,343
Okay, you're not a statue.
But can you fit your big head through here?

1288
01:30:06,344 --> 01:30:08,728
[The zebra sticks its head in through
the window without any hesitation.]

1289
01:30:09,977 --> 01:30:12,693
Wow, look at your mouth.

1290
01:30:12,694 --> 01:30:14,707
No, not me.
You can't eat me.

1291
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,571
No, it's not me.
Don't blow your nose on me.

1292
01:30:19,197 --> 01:30:20,723
Come back here.

1293
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:22,597
I've got your carrot right here.

1294
01:30:22,598 --> 01:30:25,170
Stick your head in through the window,
and you'll have your carrot.

1295
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:36,205
What's wrong with you?
I've got your carrot right here.

1296
01:30:38,336 --> 01:30:40,941
[Fails the first attempt- Turned
its head away right before the shot.]

1297
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,401
I don't think I got the shot.

1298
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,387
[Fail! Both of their faces must be
fully captured in order for it to count.]

1299
01:30:53,388 --> 01:30:54,679
You want another one?

1300
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:57,803
[Stamps down his fear
to make another attempt.]

1301
01:30:58,173 --> 01:31:00,259
Come on, I told you not to
breathe on me.

1302
01:31:03,645 --> 01:31:05,066
Hey, where did you go?

1303
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:08,161
[Full after his carrot snack,
the zebra just walks away.]

1304
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:10,088
Wow, this is really hard.

1305
01:31:17,876 --> 01:31:20,000
[Unsure of what to do.]

1306
01:31:20,001 --> 01:31:23,114
[There's only three minutes
left on the clock!]

1307
01:31:26,317 --> 01:31:29,953
[Jae Suk successfully completes
his eagle mission.]

1308
01:31:29,954 --> 01:31:33,766
[Sharing his joy with the trainer
and the eagle.]

1309
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:35,256
Can I get going now?

1310
01:31:35,257 --> 01:31:38,173
- Four are still missing.
- Four members still need to make it back.

1311
01:31:38,174 --> 01:31:40,014
[Must make it back to the meeting spot
before the time is over to be validated.]

1312
01:31:42,156 --> 01:31:44,655
[Just then, a bus drives by in the back.]

1313
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:46,976
Than man totally ruined it.

1314
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:48,645
Mister!

1315
01:31:48,646 --> 01:31:50,074
I almost had it.

1316
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:56,138
[Come on, ribbon...]

1317
01:31:56,139 --> 01:31:59,424
[Smile, zebra.]

1318
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:01,994
Did I get it?

1319
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,651
[Unties the last ribbon... and runs out
of there without even a backwards glance!]

1320
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,764
I did it.

1321
01:32:14,589 --> 01:32:17,159
[Kwang Soo's alligator mission-
Successfully unties three ribbons.]

1322
01:32:17,768 --> 01:32:19,658
I did it.
Thank you!

1323
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:25,052
[Run away, my friend!]

1324
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:26,741
Run!

1325
01:32:26,742 --> 01:32:29,987
[Must run if they want to avoid
having to pay the ultimate penalty!]

1326
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:38,337
- You've succeeded your mission.
- Yes, I did it!

1327
01:32:38,338 --> 01:32:40,469
[Captain Park finally succeeds his mission.]

1328
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,017
Here, enjoy your carrot.

1329
01:32:42,697 --> 01:32:46,059
[But they must arrive back at the spot
before the time is up to be validated!]

1330
01:32:49,183 --> 01:32:53,962
[The Captain is now the only one left!]

1331
01:32:54,632 --> 01:32:56,301
Can you pull your head back out?

1332
01:32:58,702 --> 01:33:00,751
Is it over already?

1333
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:04,415
What is Ji Sung's mission
that he still isn't back yet?

1334
01:33:05,108 --> 01:33:06,935
- Ji Sung!
- Is he here?

1335
01:33:06,936 --> 01:33:09,465
- Did you succeed your mission?
- Kwang Soo!

1336
01:33:09,836 --> 01:33:11,128
What's that?

1337
01:33:13,146 --> 01:33:14,368
What are you doing?

1338
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:16,291
[The moment he's back, he attempts
to take a selca with a giraffe.]

[Every members successfully
completes their safari mission.]

01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:26,904
[Since we didn't get to do the skydiving,
be sure that it'll be coming your way soon!]

1342
01:33:26,905 --> 01:33:30,623
[Don't walk, but Run!
Already the 200th episode.]

1343
01:33:30,624 --> 01:33:33,190
I truly don't know how we've made it
to our 200th episode already.

1344
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,286
Yes, you're right.

1345
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:37,094
But we've had help from a countless
number of great guests.

1346
01:33:37,095 --> 01:33:39,685
We were only able to make it here with help
of great friends like Park Ji Sung.

a great guest to have on the show.

allowed us to continue our run...]

We will continue to run hard
every week for you.

1353
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:04,721
We sincerely thank everyone for allowing us
to run every week for the past 200 episodes.

1354
