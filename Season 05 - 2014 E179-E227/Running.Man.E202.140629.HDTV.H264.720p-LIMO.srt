33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,130
[A train trip? All the stars gather
together on the train platform.]

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,400
I need everyone to gather together.

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,750
Jae Suk, you're our guide
today, right?

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,930
You're our guide, right?
You're dressed the part today.

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,570
- You might be hot in that outfit.
- I'm your MC for the day.

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,630
[Not a guide, but the MC host for the day.]

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,630
You will all be taking the train to Gyungjoo.

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,280
[Gyungjoo is their destination for the day.]

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,010
I know I've told you this earlier,
but Gary got lucky with his team.

42
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,540
I guess he's a part of the Idol team?

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,970
Why don't you come over here
and take care of your own teammates?

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,110
No, it's not like that.

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,270
She kept nudging me on my shoulder earlier
saying that I was blocking her from view.

46
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,540
- He's just so big.
- Is 'Otswiri' your real name?

47
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,180
Yes, it's pronounced like
'572' in Korean.

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,290
- He's '160'.
- Why is he '160'?

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,450
[He's 160cm tall.]

50
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,400
No, I'm 170cm tall.

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,600
What do you want your number
to be, Ji Sung?

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,340
- What do you want your number to be?
- You should be 'Zero' for Lee Bo Young.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,520
[Lee Bo Young, his new bride.]

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,480
Lee Bo Young.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,220
[Their train pulls up to the platform
making everyone anxious for what's to come.]

56
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,380
[A cheerful start of the trip to Gyungjoo.]

57
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,970
[Just what kind of an event
awaits them in Gyungjoo?]

58
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,870
Today's race is 'The Race of the Stars'
Played by the top stars of our country.

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,540
We will start off by revealing what your
final mission is going to be.

60
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,620
- Already?
- Yes, here's your final mission.

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,800
[Final competition- A quiz battle.]

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,810
- It's a quiz competition.
- Are you serious?

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,580
- A quiz battle?
- My teammates can't handle that!

64
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,280
[From Ghana and France.]

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,640
Ha Ha, Fabien and Otswiri are
better than you.

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,030
[No response to that remark.]

67
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,130
Can we play a game of pocket ball?

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,010
It's not going to be
your run of the mill quiz battle.

69
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,180
What kind of a quiz battle will it be?

70
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,140
Once you get off at your train station

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,790
you will have to complete a variety
of missions related to the quiz battle.

72
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,130
Depending how well you do
with each of those missions

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,330
you will be given an MC chance card,
which could be of great advantage to you.

74
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,590
- What's the MC chance card?
- I can't tell you that right now.

75
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,910
But these chance cards will be of great help
to you at your final mission

76
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,850
so you have to make sure not to
lose your chance cards.

77
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,270
[Is that so?]

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,400
[The key to today's race is, MC Yoo.]

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,880
[The team with MC Yoo on their side
will rule the game.]

80
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,390
Today's Race of the Stars,
which all you stars are participating in...

81
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,020
Since this is the Race of the Stars

82
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,870
we have prepared a prize for the victors
in the likes which have never seen before.

83
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,920
[Greatest prize in the history of the show.]

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Awesome!

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,490
We even had a diamond ring as
the winning prize on a recent episode.

86
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,150
[Jin Se Yeon recently won a one carat
diamond ring as her winning prize.]

87
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,530
Our team is going to win today's race!

88
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,290
Everyone's in such a good mood already.

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,660
Wow, everyone's in such a good
mood right now.

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,620
I think that teamwork is going to be the key
to winning the race today.

91
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,190
Thus, even though it's a short ride

92
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,790
I think it would be wise for each of the teams
to get to know their teammates well.

93
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,520
That's why we're going to come up with
a battle cry for each of the teams.

94
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,570
- Come up with your own battle cry.
- What should ours be?

95
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,360
Now that you know that a prize is on the line,
everyone's moving at a much faster pace.

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,730
Everyone's jumping right into action.

97
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,130
[Everyone's busy trying to come up
with a battle cry for their own team.]

98
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,270
Suk Jin's even trying to come up with
our own team dance moves.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,970
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes!

100
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,040
Then we will now hear team by team
to see what you've all come up with.

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,370
We will start with Gary's team.
Ready, set, go.

102
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,050
- Mr. Gae.
- Gae!

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,440
- On our lips is Gae.
- Gae!

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,590
Pink, Pink, Gary, Pink!

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,080
[An adorable battle cry for Team Idols.]

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,600
[Next up us the Global Team.]

107
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,650
Fabien!
Ha Ha Ha...

108
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,450
[Still unable to overcome the border
that surrounds each of their nations?]

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,700
[Time to hear Team Beautiful's battle cry.]

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,090
The flowers are blooming,
where the flowers are blooming.

111
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,250
Team Beautiful... Yay!

112
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,740
Kyung Hwan, you've got really
sweaty armpits.

113
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,370
Okay, next team.

114
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,110
- Ready, set...
- Sorry, but Suk Jin came up with it all.

115
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,220
You can't be embarrassed by it.
Stare directly into the camera.

116
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,080
[Team Sports All-stars' battle cry.]

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,710
In the pocket, in the pocket,
want to put Cha Yu Ram in our pockets.

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,750
[Finishes off the battle cry with
a billiards pose by Yu Ram.]

119
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,080
[Team Film Stars bursts out laughing
before they even get started.]

120
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,440
Set, go.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,020
- Good friends...
- Good friends...

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,060
- Good friends...
- Good friends...

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
- Good friends!
- That's so dull.

124
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,110
Let us give it another try.

125
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,590
- What are you doing?
- Just give us one more chance.

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
Forget it, we'll just skip you guys.

127
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,450
That's the kind of stuff that I used to
come up with when I was in middle school.

128
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,090
Joo Ji Hoon's 'Joo', Ji Sung's 'Ji',
Lee Kwang Soo's 'Soo'!

129
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,890
We are, Joo Ji Soo!

130
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,650
Joo Ji Soo?

131
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,650
[What the heck is that?]

132
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,050
What the heck is, 'Joo Ji Soo'?

133
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,480
Ji Hoon and I should do our own parts,
so why are you doing it all?

134
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,120
- Let's all do it together.
- Don't try to do it all, Kwang Soo.

135
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,920
- We came up with something new.
- You got something new? Ready, set, go.

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,310
Ghana's Ghana!

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,260
[Short but effective battle cry
for the team.]

138
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,880
Otswiri can't go back to Ghana right now.

139
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,900
[Otswiri is planning on using the prize money
to return to his home in glory?]

140
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,290
We have such a huge prize
for the winning team on the line.

141
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,310
As you've all been told before,
you will be getting off at Shim Station.

142
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,760
But all five of the teams will have to
participate in simple games along the way.

143
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,250
And the team that comes in last will have to
stay on this train all the way to Busan.

144
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,670
So the team that ends up taking the train
all the way to Busan Station

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,900
will be behind the other four teams no matter
what kind of other missions you'll be doing.

146
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,780
[A huge disadvantage of time being wasted
and falling behind the other teams.]

147
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,960
I was looking at Joo Ji Hoon earlier when
the camera wasn't rolling

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,930
and I was wondering why you keep staring out
the window with that glazed look in your eyes.

149
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,170
Did you have to come on this show
against your own will or something?

150
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,480
- Ji Hoon's usually a chatterbox.
- Ji Hoon just keeps staring out the window.

151
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,430
He's guzzling down that water
like it's alcohol.

152
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,770
Are you sure that's just water
in that bottle?

153
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,640
[With his sad doe-like eyes...]

154
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,570
[He only keeps staring out
the window.]

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,880
Just what is it that you're
thinking about?

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,580
I just feel a little awkward being here.

157
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,870
Who do you feel most awkward and
uncomfortable around here right now?

158
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,130
- Ah, Gary?
- Me?

159
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,630
[Scent of awkwardness is
wafting off of Mr. Gary.]

160
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,530
[Of all people, the person he most feels
awkward around happens to sit next to him.]

161
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,820
[Gary pretends to fall asleep
the moment he sits down in his chair.]

162
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,010
Why are you making him feel
so uncomfortable?

163
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,610
[The train arrives at Dongdaegu Station.]

164
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,250
We will now start a simple round of games
which I've mentioned to you earlier.

165
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,520
[Time to start the game.]

166
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Are we at a disadvantage for
sitting way in the back?

167
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,300
No, not at all.

168
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,260
It's a very simple game which you're all
familiar with and play frequently.

169
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,760
It's a very easy game.

170
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
All three members of the team have to play.
Please sit down.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,660
- Do we sit down for the game?
- Yes, you have to be sitting down.

172
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,400
Is it noonchi game?

173
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Is it noonchi?

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,960
What are you saying right now?

175
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,650
I feel like there's an old Korean man
sitting behind me right now.

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,280
Everyone, we will be playing
the noonchi game.

177
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,080
- We will now start the game.
- You'd better stand up at one.

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,760
- I'm going to stand up at two.
- You have to listen to me carefully.

179
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,440
We will get started as soon as
you hear me say, 'Ready, set, go'.

180
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,500
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

181
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,650
- Start.
- One!

182
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,760
Okay, you're disqualified.

183
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,750
You're disqualified.
I said, we'll start at 'Ready, set, go'.

184
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,980
[Not 'Start', but at 'Ready, set, go'.]

185
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,320
[Haroro is immediately disqualified.]

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,020
[Whatever MC Yoo says goes for the day.]

187
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,960
- But I said, 'Start', so it's not valid.
- He just didn't know. Give him a break.

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,500
- Ha Ha is disqualified.
- It's because one of us is foreign.

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,810
Fabien just said that one of
them is foreign.

190
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,330
[The French boy is looking after
foreign Ha Ha.]

191
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,030
It's because he's not very good at
understanding Korean yet.

192
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,600
To Otswiri and Fabien,
Ha Ha is the foreigner.

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,300
[That actually kind of makes sense.
To Otswiri and Fabien, Ha Ha is the foreigner.]

194
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,290
- Please give us a break.
- Sorry to say this, but Ha Ha is disqualified.

195
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,150
[Rules are rules!
Ha Ha is unfortunately disqualified.]

196
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,310
Okay, at 'Ready, set, go'.

197
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,710
Ready, set, go.

198
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,090
One.

199
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,850
Two.

200
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,220
- Three.
- Four.

201
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,540
- Five!
- Five!

202
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,490
[Cha Yu Ram and Yoon Bo Mi
are simultaneously disqualified.]

203
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,280
- Cha Ru Ram and Yoon Bo Mi are disqualified.
- I told you not to do it.

204
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,110
You're the one who got disqualified,
so why are you hitting me?

205
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,070
Cha Yu Ram and Yoon Bo Mi
are unfortunately disqualified.

206
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,160
Ready, set, go.

207
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,480
- One.
- One.

208
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,160
[As soon as the game starts,
Blank Ji and Ji Sung are disqualified.]

209
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,720
And with that last round, one
member from each team is disqualified.

210
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,230
[One member from each team is disqualified.]

211
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,450
[Who knew that noonchi game
was such a fierce battle?]

212
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,050
Are you all ready?

213
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,480
Ready, set, go

214
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,070
[Joo Ji Hoon succeeds while everyone's
too busy looking at Kwang Soo.]

215
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,210
One!

216
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,990
One!

217
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,640
[Ji Hoon just said one...]

218
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,650
Disqualified!

219
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,280
[Ah... Big-nosed Brother...]

220
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,390
I couldn't hear anything back there!

221
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,510
But he said it loudly.
He said it loudly enough.

222
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,690
[Big-nosed Brother brings about laughter
with his hard hearing.]

223
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,880
But I really didn't hear anything.

224
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
Your team still has a chance at survival as
long as Jong Kook doesn't get eliminated

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,970
so don't worry about it.

226
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,110
I'll take care of it myself.

227
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,220
I guess your team is heading to Busan.

228
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,270
I guess your team will be heading
to Busan.

229
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm sure it's been a while since
you've last visited Busan.

230
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,640
- So you can take a trip to Busan.
- But we really didn't hear anything.

231
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,910
It's not that you didn't hear,
but you decided not to hear.

232
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,120
Everyone had better speak up.

233
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,800
- How many players are still left in the game?
- Ready, set, go.

234
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,720
One.

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
- Two.
- Three.

236
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,530
- Four.
- Five.

237
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,920
[Sung Hyun gets flustered
and pops up from his seat.]

238
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,040
He really needs to go to the bathroom.

239
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Sung Hyun is disqualified!

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,370
Fabien and Otswiri are quite impressive.

241
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,130
Otswiri is really good at this game.

242
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,840
And they're like experts of this game.

243
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,250
- They seem so relaxed.
- So relaxed while playing the game.

244
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,540
- I will do the best I can.
- Where did you learn to play this game?

245
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,290
Don't you think that
you're too good at this game?

246
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,490
Otswiri just said that he'll represent
Korea in this game.

247
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,690
Ready, set, go.

248
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,970
One.

249
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,420
Two.

250
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,290
- Three.
- Three.

251
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,600
[Team Sports All-stars' wins
the Busan trip!]

252
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,040
[Remaining stars are celebrating not
having to go all the way to Busan.]

253
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,810
[It's going to take some time to go to Busan,
then having to double back to Gyungjoo.]

254
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,980
Let's give a round of applause to
Team Sports All-stars' for going to Busan.

255
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,090
[Rubbing salt into the wound
by asking for a round of applause.]

256
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,300
Bye, Jong Kook!

257
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,550
[Playing music from his speaker?]

258
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:32,640
[The music you hear is Grasshopper playing
a song to aggravate the tiger even further.]

259
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,310
[The music ends, and Otswiri now gets up
to dance along to the music.]

260
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,230
[You just wait and see...]

261
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,790
We will soon be arriving at Shin Station.

262
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,410
Your mission will start the moment
you get off this train.

263
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,860
Do you see what's been set up on
the platform?

264
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,200
Don't have too much fun without us.

265
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,980
[Arrives at Shingyoung Station.]

266
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,910
They're all getting off.

267
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,580
[With the exception of Sports All-star Team,
everyone else gets off the train.]

268
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,120
What's this?

269
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,560
[A mission card as soon as
they get off the train.]

270
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,720
Kim Jong Kook and the rest of his teammates
will continue on with their train ride.

271
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,410
[The one team that weren't able to
get off the train with the others...]

272
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,670
Bye.

273
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,830
I can't even see them from here.

274
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,160
What's going on here?
They're filming out there on the platform.

275
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,180
I told you guys not to
shout out too prematurely.

276
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,330
- Yes, we had a plan.
- We actually had good seats for that game.

277
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,220
We could've observed others and
predict what they were going to do.

278
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,510
- Did you hear Ji Hoon earlier?
- No, I didn't hear him either.

279
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,710
- I couldn't hear a thing from back here.
- To be honest, I actually heard him.

280
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,930
You heard him?

281
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,360
[Even though she heard Ji Hoon,
she still argued that she didn't.]

282
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,260
You did good.
I like that kind of mentality.

283
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,200
- We are a team.
- I need to dispute it if I can.

284
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,960
[Have fun conversing amongst yourselves,
during your train ride to Busan.]

285
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,040
We will now start picking your mission cards.

286
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,680
[The rest of the teams busy themselves
choosing their first mission cards.]

287
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,320
Do we just choose whichever one we want?

288
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,770
Yes, all four cards are the same.

289
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,540
<i>[Go to '__' house, and find the 'R' flag.]</i>

290
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,780
<i>If you go to the three locations
listed on the card</i>

291
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,930
<i>you'll be able to find a hint
to help you solve this mission.</i>

292
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:20,590
<i>[Go to '__' house, and find the 'R' flag.]</i>

293
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,590
If we can figure it out after
going to just one of these locations

294
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,670
then can we just go to the location
that the clue is indicating to?

295
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,090
[Can guess at any time that they want.]

296
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,510
Everyone.

297
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,600
- I will see you all in a little bit.
- Okay.

298
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,430
- Is it a celebrity's home?
- No, it's not.

299
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,150
We need to go to those three locations to
get clues to the home this is indicating to.

300
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,140
If we go to these three locations

301
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,250
I bet someone will be there to tell us
one letter to the three letter word.

302
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,980
That's my best guess.

303
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,070
- I really want to ride this.
- Can we go ride this?

304
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,190
- I really want to go on that ride.
- Can we please go, Gary?

305
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,890
Why are you girls doing this to me?
I really don't want to!

306
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,820
Can we please go?

307
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,600
- It has to be a less crowded space.
- Where are you guys going?

308
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,220
[MC Yoo's thoughtful surprise hearing test.]

309
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,660
Hello, Driver.

310
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,770
We're going to Ahnapji Pond.

311
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,460
I just lied to them thwart them off.

312
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,210
[I don't think anyone was even
listening to you.]

313
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,410
[Off to find their hints!]

314
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,890
Since Gyungjoo was the capitol city
during the Shilla period...

315
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,870
- Seriously? This place?
- Yes, you're right.

316
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,610
- Bulkuksa Temple is very famous.
- Yes, that's right.

317
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,450
- There are so many beautiful things there.
- Yes, you're right.

318
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,200
[Amazing! Fabien is so well knowledged
in Korea's history!]

319
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,530
I wanted to learn as much as I could
about Gyungjoo before coming here today.

320
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,840
If the final mission is going to be
a quiz battle

321
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,500
aren't you pretty good at
things like that?

322
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,060
- No, I don't know much about anything.
- But you read a lot.

323
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,650
But it doesn't matter because
most of the books I read are fiction.

324
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
What about you, Ji Sung?
You're good at quiz questions, right?

325
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,310
- Good at what?
- Quiz questions.

326
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not good at thinking on my feet.

327
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,130
How would you describe your ideal man?

328
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,050
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- You like men like Jae Suk?

329
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,150
- He's so amazing.
- What is it about him that you like?

330
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,150
- He really is amazing.
- What do you like most about Jae Suk?

331
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,700
- He's so kind.
- He is so kind.

332
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,960
- He is exactly what you see.
- Totally.

333
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,340
[Gary's first impression was much more
chic and impressionable than expected.]

334
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,140
A man needs to be chic
and kind of mysterious too.

335
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,570
- If a man is too nice...
- Yes, you're right.

336
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,330
- It's not as attractive.
- But there's something about Jae Suk, right?

337
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,590
There's just no way to beat
Yoo Jae Suk.

338
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,340
[This unbeatable man is busy
taking in the sights of Gyungjoo.]

339
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,930
I think we've already been here before.
We've been here before, haven't we?

340
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,670
[Gyungjoo, a city full of history-
Historical ruins as far as the eye can see.]

341
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,680
It's Ha Ha.

342
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,130
- Yes, hello?
- Hello, Jae Suk.

343
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,150
- Excuse me?
- It's Otswiri and Fabien calling.

344
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,530
What is it, Otswiri?

345
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,120
Well, it's nothing important,
but you know how Ha Ha is on our team?

346
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,370
- Yeah.
- But Ha Ha really doesn't know anything.

347
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,590
No, he really doesn't know anything.

348
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,040
We're on our way to the first location,
but we had to call you for some help.

349
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you by any chance have any hints
that you can give us?

350
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,350
I really am sorry to tell you this,
but I really don't know anything either.

351
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,250
- But you must know something...
- Ask him where he's going right now.

352
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,970
- Where are you going right now?
- Put Ha Ha on the phone.

353
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,190
- Ha Ha's in the bathroom right now.
- What?

354
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,720
- He's pooping in the bathroom right now.
- Come on, don't lie to me like that.

355
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,340
He's not feeling very well right now,
we don't know where we're going.

356
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,280
In that case, call me back
once Ha Ha comes back.

357
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,400
- Ah... oh, here he is right now.
- Hello?

358
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,740
- Hello?
- Jae Suk.

359
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,720
- There you are, Ha Ha.
- No, I just got here.

360
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,060
That was all a lie, wasn't it?
You guys lied to me, didn't you?

361
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,540
Where are you going right now?

362
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,400
[MC Yoo is headed to the '__' home right now.]

363
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,890
Come on, help us out here.
Just tell us where you're going.

364
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,730
Just follow me.

365
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,770
[Hangs up on Ha Ha and his team.]

366
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,660
[Where is Jae Suk headed?]

367
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,490
[Question- '___' home.]

368
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,760
[Just then, Team Film Stars arrives at
the Palace of the Crown Prince.]

369
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,540
- Thank you.
- I think this is the place.

370
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,660
[Hurried inside the palace
to find their hint.]

371
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,480
I wonder what we'll have to do in here.

372
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,230
[King Munmu's second palace that he had built
to commemorate the unification of Shilla.]

373
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,570
[The palace where King Munmu entertained his
most valued guests and hosted events.]

374
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,910
[Team Film Stars starts to run without
a clue as to what they're looking for.]

375
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,990
- Let's go check it out.
- Did we make a mistake coming here?

376
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,890
[Where could their hint be?]

377
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,890
- That other team is here too.
- This is where all the parties used to be.

378
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,910
Yes, that's right.

379
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,730
- This is where all the royals would gather.
- And they'd drink together.

380
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:22,920
[Impressively breathtaking views.]

381
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,400
I feel so at peace in here.

382
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,680
- I think that's Kwang Soo over there.
- Yes, I just saw them too.

383
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,920
[Discovers Team Film Stars.]

384
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,130
[Sooner they find the hint,
sooner they can move on.]

385
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,190
Here it is!
I see the 'R' mark.

386
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,440
- I see it too.
- Where? Oh, right over there.

387
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
[This place is...]

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,650
We're not going to have to
go up in that, are we?

389
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,450
We don't have to go up in that, do we?

390
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,190
[Yes, you will have to go up.]

391
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,440
[Not just that, but very high!]

392
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,660
- We can do it, Gary!
- 150m?

393
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,230
- We really have to go up?
- Come on, we're all friends now.

394
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,600
[On the other hand, the girls
are excited about the balloon ride.]

395
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,380
- This is going to be so much fun.
- Women are always causing trouble.

396
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,080
[Giant hot air balloon ride.]

397
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,780
Gentle!

398
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,340
[It's off the ground!]

399
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,800
Which way are we going?

400
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,250
We're going 150m up into the air
in this thing?

401
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,090
[Flying up into the sky!]

402
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,020
[A wide open view of everything
from the sky.]

403
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,380
We're up really high right now.
You should try looking down below.

404
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,760
Do you think that the hint is
somewhere down below?

405
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,350
- You need to look around you.
- See? We need to search below.

406
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,890
- Hey girls.
- I don't see anything yet.

407
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,000
Hey, since we have to do that thing
from up here...

408
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,880
I mean, down below and from afar...

409
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,630
[Being 150m up in the air makes
Leader Gae tongue tied.]

410
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,300
Wait a minute, why is that music playing?

411
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,780
- I'm starting to feel sick.
- Do you know the song that's playing?

412
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,650
- No.
- Do you know this song, Bo Mi?

413
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,730
Don't you think that the song
means something?

414
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,880
- I think it's our hint.
- Listen carefully to the lyrics.

415
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,200
[The sound of the song fills up the open sky.]

416
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,240
Careless jokes we tell?

417
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,090
Do you know who sings this song?
Do we have to know who sings it?

418
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,180
[I know I've heard this song before...]

419
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,850
<i>Of all the things that I've lost...</i>

420
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,210
Hey!
There it is!

421
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,210
[Did he discover something down there?]

422
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,210
[This is the hint to finding out which
house the mission is indicating to!]

423
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,240
There's an app for the QR code.
Go into the app store.

424
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,740
Ji Hoon, I doubt it's something
technical like that.

425
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,480
We just need to find the hint somewhere.

426
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,160
- Really?
- Yeah, it doesn't require deep thinking.

427
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,070
We're not going to have to solve riddles
regarding the palace or anything.

428
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,180
The hint is probably hidden somewhere.

429
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,870
Ji Hoon!

430
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,430
I'm telling you that's not it.
You're not even listening to me.

431
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,760
[Please listen to me!]

432
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,130
[Okay, let's go look for clues.]

433
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,460
Ha Ha!

434
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,120
[Did they find something?]

435
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,740
Here it is.

436
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,570
[Fabien pulls a trick to throw them off.]

437
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,150
[It was a trick...]

438
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,240
- Did he really trick us?
- Let's go the other way.

439
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,870
A foreigner tricked us in our own language.

440
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,540
Just where in the world is it hidden?

441
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,210
Hey!
Did you find something?

442
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,060
[Just where could their hint be hidden?]

443
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,070
[Just then, Ji Hoon starts heading off
towards something.]

444
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,500
Here it is!

445
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,720
[He discovers the written hint!]

446
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,370
Okay.

447
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,560
Is there only one hint?

448
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,660
This wasn't a game that
required intelligence.

449
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,600
I read too deep into it for nothing.

450
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,610
Be careful not to rip it.

451
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,240
[What kind of a hint is written on the note?]

452
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,970
Chang... Soo?

453
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,610
Bu-chang-Bu-Soo.
(Conjugal harmony.)

454
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,040
[Smart Ji Hoon guesses it correctly
as soon as he sees the hint.]

455
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,020
This has to be the answer.

456
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,760
['__' home-
Palace of the Crown Prince- 'Bu'.]

457
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,460
- We have to go find the hint.
- You go that way and we'll go this way.

458
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,770
- Are you trying to leave me?
- Let's talk only in English from now on.

459
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,120
Do you think that I won't be able to
understand you if you spoke in English?

460
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,810
- Fine, speak in English!
- How about we speak in French instead?

461
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,440
French?
You think I don't know French?

462
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,980
He's going to keep following us.

463
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,100
Watch your language!

464
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,650
Kwang Soo!

465
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,290
[The other two smart guys call out to
Kwang Soo after having found the hint.]

466
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,930
- Did you find something?
- Hurry up, Kwang Soo.

467
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,350
Just come on.
We found it.

468
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,830
[The variety leader who's
not any sort of help.]

469
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,030
They must've found it.

470
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,050
Otswiri.

471
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,730
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,350
- I have to go, but it was fun.
- Okay.

473
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,770
[Puts on a haughty act
after having done absolutely nothing.]

474
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,420
- I think they found something.
- What? Let us come with you.

475
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,350
- Let's just all go together.
- No, you can't.

476
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,280
- We have to remain loyal to each other.
- Our shirts are different colors.

477
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,390
- But we should still remain loyal.
- I can't do that.

478
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,920
[Ghana and France are pressing
Kwang Soo for his loyalty.]

479
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,980
I told you that he's the worst
kind of traitor there is.]

480
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Where's Ha Ha right now?

481
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,870
[I said, come right now!]

482
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,550
- Sorry!
- Let us come with you!

483
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,260
- We're on different teams.
- Let us come with you.

484
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,160
[Giraffe gets dragged off by
enthusiastic Ji Hoon.]

485
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,830
[Just where is Ha Ha in the
midst of all this?]

486
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,630
['The foreigner' has lost his way...]

487
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,740
[Finds the hint from having gotten lost.]

488
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,280
'__' Chang, '__' Soo.

489
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,790
[Bu-Chang- Bu-Soo. Conjugal harmony.
Wife follows the lead of her husband.]

490
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,150
The clue said, Bu-Chang- Bu-Soo.
But the 'Bu' was omitted.

491
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,730
What's Bu-Chang- Bu-Soo?

492
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,740
- Then should we...
- Let's go to one more place.

493
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,380
[Off to find their second hint to figure out
where the mission was indicating to.]

494
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,340
One was a little park by the pond

495
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,450
and the other was some sort of
hot air balloon.

496
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,200
- Is it close by?
- Yes, it's close.

497
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,410
[Team Beautiful is currently
taking their turn on the hot air balloon.]

498
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,450
When you feel scared,
just stare off into the distance.

499
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,110
Can you see your house from here?

500
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,020
Can you see Tongyoung from here?

501
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,670
[While this team is busy
searching for their hint...]

502
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,680
- We're going to be 100 minutes behind.
- If we calculate all the times...

503
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,430
We have to catch up to them if we can.

504
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,670
- We have to get off.
- Do we have to get off this ride?

505
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,720
[Finally arrives at Busan Station.]

506
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,340
- We can do it.
- Don't worry, Yu Ram.

507
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,450
[Yu Ram is feeling anxious
to get to where they need to go.]

508
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,870
[Must find the train that will get them
to Shinkyung Station as soon as possible.]

509
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,320
I never would've guessed that
I'd be coming to Busan today.

510
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,750
- So this is Busan?
- Yes, this is Busan.

511
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,960
- Wow, seriously.
- There it is.

512
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,460
What time is it right now?

513
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,970
- We can take the 3:30 train.
- 3:30 train?

514
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,400
It's in 15 minutes.
We can take the 3:30 train.

515
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,380
- Okay, this is good.
- Hello.

516
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,040
- How much to Shinkyung Station?
- There are three of us.

517
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,860
[They get lucky and find
three empty seats on the train!]

518
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,370
The train is scheduled to arrive at 3:56.

519
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,650
[A high speed train which will get them
to Shinkyung Station in only 26 minutes!]

520
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,840
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day!

521
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,840
- Good, we're all set.
- I think we should get going right now.

522
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,750
[Not much time before
the high speed train takes off.]

523
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,790
- Let's take a quick picture before we go.
- Okay.

524
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,750
[Even though they didn't want it,
since them came all the way here...]

525
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,240
Let's take a picture with the
Busan Station sign in the background.

526
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,700
[A quick trip down to Busan without even
stepping foot outside the train station.]

527
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,080
[In memory of their quick visit to Busan.]

528
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,220
- Wow, this height is no joke.
- Look carefully below you.

529
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,870
We need one person to look to the right,
and one person to look to the left.

530
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,800
[Just like the last mission, only
these two are carrying on the mission.]

531
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,420
Listen carefully to the song.

532
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,290
- I hear some song in the background.
- Why are they playing a song?

533
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,940
It's 'Here's to Romance' by Choi Baek Ho.

534
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,450
What's the name of this song?

535
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,240
[Team Beautiful seeks help from onlookers.]

536
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,910
Does anyone know what this song is?

537
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,320
- Choi Baek Ho's 'Here's to Romance'.
- Choi Baek Ho!

538
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,960
- Yes, Choi Baek Ho!
- It's Choi Baek Ho!

539
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,460
[That's right! Choi Baek Ho!]

540
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,280
[Smart Ji Hoon correctly guesses
the answer again in first try!]

541
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,460
There it is down there too.
Baek Ho.

542
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,230
[Confirms their answer with
the hint on the hot air balloon.]

543
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,160
- Choi Baek Ho!
- Thank you!

544
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Thank you and we love you!

545
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,110
- Thank you. The hint is, Baek Ho.
- But what does that even mean?

546
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,030
Is it Choi Baek Ho's house?
Is that what it means?

547
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,910
So Choi Baek Ho has to fit
somewhere within this riddle somehow.

548
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,380
[Time to start piecing the clues together.]

549
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,540
['__' home-
Palace of the Crown Prince- 'Bu'.]

550
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,330
[Giant hot air balloon- 'Choi'.]

551
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,600
Ji Hyo!
I found it!

552
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,570
[Team Beautiful heads off to
Palace of the Crown Prince.]

553
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,980
- Bu-Chang- Bu-Soo.
- Bu-Chang- Bu-Soo?

554
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,930
[Sung Hyun figures it out
as soon as he sees it.]

555
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,910
Choi, Bu... Choi Bu Ram?

556
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,730
Choi Bu...
It's supposed to be someone's home.

557
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,920
[Clues they've earned so far-
'Bu' and 'Choi'.

558
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,510
Sir, the final place that we
have to go to is

559
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,910
is a home with the letter,
'Choi' in it.

560
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,810
[Meanwhile, Team Idols is trying to figure out
their hint at Queen Sundeok's garden.]

561
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:34,370
['__' home.
Clues pieced together- 'Bu-Choi-Ja'.]

562
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,510
- It's someone with the last name of Choi.
- That would be Choi Bu Ja.

563
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,020
[Choi Bu Ja's home?]

564
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,840
Choi Bu Ja?
Who's Choi Bu Ja?

565
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,070
- Choi Bu Ja.
- Who's Choi Bu Ja?

566
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,300
[Other teams slowly start to
piece the puzzle together.]

567
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,880
- Come on, we need to hurry!
- But who's Choi Bu Ja?

568
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,250
[It's now all about who can get there first!]

569
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,550
Is there a Choi Bu Ja home in the area?

570
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,670
- There is?
- It's in Gyochon.

571
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,500
Choi Bu Ja's home is in Gyochon?
Is it a famous place?

572
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,030
[Choi Bu Ja's home is known by
anyone who lives in Gyungjoo.]

573
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,210
Okay, we understand.
Thank you so much.

574
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,460
It has to be it.
I'm sure of it!

575
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,760
Come on, let's go!

576
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,970
Do you know where Choi Bu Ja's home is?

577
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,850
[Then could that be where
MC Yoo is right now?]

578
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,030
Gyungjoo's Choi Bu Ja home?

579
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,530
[Bingo!
This is Choi Bu Ja's home!]

580
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:36,170
[Choi Bu Ja's home.]

581
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,260
[Other members have to find their way to
old Gyochon town where Choi Bu Ja's home is.]

582
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,880
[Town of Gyochon and Choi's old residence.]

583
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,350
I thought that the driver was going to
answer all our quiz questions for us.

584
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,270
Okay, here's your question.
When I asked him about the house...

585
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,830
[Driver's correct answer was full of
eagerness and enthusiasm.]

586
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,590
You got the correct answer.

587
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,010
[Just which of the three teams
will get there first?]

588
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,640
Time to get off.

589
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,790
[Team Sports All-stars' finally arrives
at Shingyoung after their Busan detour.]

590
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,250
Yu Ram is a perfect fit for Running Man.

591
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,470
[Just who will be the first to touch ground
at Choi Bu Ja's home?]

592
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,130
[Which of these six teams
will get there first?]

593
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,370
There they are.

594
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,650
[That winning team is none other than...]

595
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,080
[Team Beautiful.]

596
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,550
[Reunited with MC Yoo after
only two hours.]

597
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,690
- You guys got here way too early.
- We figured it out pretty quick.

598
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,940
- Why don't you go get a cup of coffee?
- How about a cup of Americano?

599
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,140
- Americano?
- Yes, Americano.

600
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,070
Choi Bu Ja was a very famous nobleman.

601
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,740
- I had no idea who he was.
- No, he was a real man.

602
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,400
- I came here in a daze...
- This is what's so great about Running Man.

603
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,090
You all made it here even though
you didn't know anything about this man.

604
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,920
- We really didn't know anything.
- Go find the 'R' flag quickly.

605
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,700
[Must hurry and find the 'R' flag!]

606
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,710
- Somewhere in this village...
- In the village?

607
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,530
- In this traditional village?
- Yes, somewhere within this entire village.

608
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,000
There is an 'R' flag
hidden within the village.

609
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,410
You have to find the flag and
bring it back to me to win this mission.

610
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,280
[Wait... somewhere within this huge village?]

611
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,870
[And we have to search through
the whole entire village?]

612
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,930
[We thought having solved
the riddle was the end of it!]

613
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,960
[Now we have to tackle
an even bigger mountain!]

614
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,060
Please search carefully for the 'R' flag.

615
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,090
Wow, but you guys are impressive.

616
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,820
How did they ever find this house?

617
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,660
How are we going to search through
this entire village?

618
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,640
This huge village... this whole place?

619
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,750
Just how in the world
are we ever going to find it?

620
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,520
We're here.
No one else is here yet, right?

621
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,880
We're the first ones here, right?

622
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,340
We're the first ones here, right?
What? We're not the first ones here?

623
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,550
Are we the first ones here?

624
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,920
Just stand still.
No, you're not the first ones here.

625
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,830
Another team already beat you here,
and this is not the end of it.

626
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,680
How did a foreigner like you
find your way here?

627
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,110
[Haroro is the designated foreigner
of this team.]

628
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,460
Then we found the second clue,
Jang-Hwa Ja-Chang.

629
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,140
- Yes, that's right.
- So we pieced the two clues together.

630
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,630
Since he's not from this country,
he was mistaken about the clue for a while.

631
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,390
[It was Fabien
who correctly figured out the clue.]

632
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,870
Once we pieced it all together,
we were able to get 'Choi Bu Ja'.

633
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,980
Now you have to go and find
the 'R' marked flag.

634
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,240
Now you have to go and find
the 'R' marked flag.

635
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,630
'R' marked flag.

636
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,770
- Let's split up!
- That's what I love about Otswiri and Fabien.

637
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,420
They have the greatest reactions.
Look at how surprised they looked.

638
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,340
[The best reactionary couple.]

639
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,590
- Where have you guys been?
- We just got here. What about you guys?

640
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,670
- I was looking over that way.
- You're looking for the flag, right?

641
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,380
- Kimbap?
- No, the flag. (Word play.)

642
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,550
No, we're going to go on the
amusement rides.

643
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,140
[Tripping up so many native Korean speakers
with his Korean speaking skills.]

644
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,400
- You guys actually went to Busan?
- Yes, we went all the way to Busan.

645
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,910
[Team Sports All-stars' finally joins others
after taking a detour to Busan.]

646
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,710
- You guys made really good time.
- Seriously?

647
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,750
The other teams got here
less than five minutes ago.

648
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,750
You guys got here really fast
for having gone all the way to Busan.

649
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,150
- How did you get here so fast?
- Are you trying to tease us right now?

650
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,130
- How's Busan?
- We just turned around and came right back.

651
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,410
We just hopped on the return train back here
as soon as we got off the train.

652
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,830
- We didn't even get to look around.
- But wasn't it fun?

653
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,180
Yes, maybe for you.

654
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,410
- Just tell us what we need to do.
- You must find the hidden 'R' flag.

655
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,340
You have to find the 'R' marked flag
and bring it back to me.

656
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,080
- Just one?
- Yes, you only need to find one.

657
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,070
- Just one for our entire team?
- Yes, that's correct.

658
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,730
Have you guys seen any flags yet?

659
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,380
- Have you seen any flags yet?
- No, we haven't seen any.

660
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,570
No, I was asking Jae Suk.

661
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,910
[Kkuk leaves all his personal belongings
on the table with Jae Suk.]

662
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,950
- Excuse me, Jong Kook?
- Yes?

663
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,990
This isn't guest services.

664
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,100
- But it really weighs down my pockets!
- Why are you always so angry?

665
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,570
- Let me just leave these here.
- Then why do you even work out?

666
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,710
Why do you even work out if
things like this are too heavy for you?

667
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,740
- Seriously.
- Did you hide the flag somewhere, Jae Suk?

668
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,850
- No, I didn't hide anything.
- Did you try looking for the flag?

669
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,530
No, I didn't look for the flag.
I'm just relaying what the writers told me.

670
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,400
- Don't you think that he hid it somewhere?
- No, I'm serious. I didn't hide anything.

671
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,940
May the heavens strike me down
if I hid the flag somewhere myself.

672
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,410
You've already been struck down
several times.

673
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,560
['R' flag is hidden in a place where no one
could've even fathomed...]

674
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:38,410
So we're just looking for the flag without
any directions of where we're looking?

675
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,260
- Yeah, we're just on the search for it.
- Seriously?

676
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,690
[From QR code to tracking devices-
He is just too smart for our level...]

677
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,990
Hey, what is going on with this?
Where's the flag?

678
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:53,690
[No matter how hard they search,
the 'R' flag is nowhere to be seen.]

679
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,410
No one's found it yet, right?

680
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,100
No, no one's found it yet,
and that's why I'm out here.

681
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,920
- Do you not know where it is either?
- No, I don't know.

682
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,240
Had I known, I'm sure I would've
told you two already by now.

683
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,410
- Ha Ha is busy searching too.
- You haven't found it either?

684
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,020
Just look harder.
Search hard enough and you'll find it.

685
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,600
- Hand it over.
- What?

686
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,820
Look here, foreigner.

687
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,380
Foreigner, you need to start doing better.

688
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,400
- Fighting.
- Thank you.

689
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,590
How am I ever going to find it?

690
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,940
- Look very carefully.
- Do you know where it is?

691
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,390
No, I don't know.

692
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,480
- Yes, you do know.
- No, I really don't know.

693
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm in the same boat as you.
I just found out myself when I got here.

694
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,370
It's hidden somewhere unexpected?

695
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,030
[It's hidden in the most unexpected place!]

696
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,890
Could it be on Jae Suk somewhere?

697
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,010
[Can't be...]

698
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,490
[Could the flag really be on Jae Suk?]

699
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,110
[Eyes locked on target.]

700
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,390
No, that's not it.

701
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,910
[Aims straight for Jae Suk's handkerchief.]

702
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,220
No, that's not it.

703
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,260
There it is!
I knew I was right!

704
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,450
[What?]

705
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,080
[Wait, that's...]

706
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,220
[The handkerchief MC Yoo
had in his pocket all day...]

707
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:41,410
[MC Yoo's handkerchief... is the 'R' flag!]

708
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,680
I knew it!

709
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,950
I saw Jae Suk's handkerchief in his pocket
and this feeling just came over me.

710
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,870
I knew something was weird about it.

711
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,700
- And I knew it had to be on Jae Suk.
- I seriously had no idea.

712
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,800
- I thought it was under your name tag.
- I really had no idea.

713
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,180
- I got it!
- Stop doing that. Someone will steal it.

714
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,760
Someone will steal the flag away from you.
- Huh?

715
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,570
Someone will steal the flag away from you.

716
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,900
[Keep up the screams of cheer, and
Mr. Capable will snatch it out of your hand.]

717
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,290
You have to be careful.

718
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,420
[Tie the flag onto the flagpole
to win the mission.]

719
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,530
- This is awesome.
- How come no one told me about it?

720
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,280
[Just then, Ji Sung comes onto the scene
and catches sight of what's going on.]

721
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,320
Get him.

722
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,630
That's the flag.

723
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,550
[Flees the scene!]

724
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,120
Everyone, Ha Ha is fleeing
with the flag in his hands.

725
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,160
Everyone!

726
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,770
Wait, let's talk.
We need to talk.

727
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,270
Come on, let's talk.
You really shouldn't be like that.

728
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,230
Jae Suk took it from me.
Jae Suk took it and he has it now.

729
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,770
- Is that right?
- Yes, I'm telling the truth.

730
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,110
I'm being totally serious right now.

731
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,980
- I'm serious. Jae Suk took it from me.
- I just saw you with it.

732
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,470
- I'm serious. Jae Suk has it.
- I know you have it on you.

733
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,880
Let's hide the flagpole for now.

734
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,230
[Something doesn't feel right...]

735
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,030
Come on!
He's somewhere around here.

736
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,370
Come on, and bring Jong Kook with you.

737
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,410
- What did you say?
- Oh, there you are.

738
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,720
- Where is it?
- My handkerchief was the 'R' flag.

739
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,210
- Who took the flag?
- Ha Ha did.

740
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,960
- Ha Ha took the flag.
- Where is it, Ha Ha?

741
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,700
- Ji Sung has something behind his back.
- What do you have?

742
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,490
Is that the 'R' flag?
No, the flag still has to be found.

743
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,160
So the flag has to be found
and tied to this flagpole?

744
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,580
Yes, you have to find the flag
and tie it to this flagpole.

745
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,990
So Ji Sung has the flagpole
and Ha Ha has the flag.

746
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,150
That's right.
Ha Ha took my handkerchief.

747
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,330
Wow, but Ha Ha really is a clever one.

748
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,200
- You have it on you right now, right?
- Yes, he has it on him right nw.

749
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,440
- I think he has it in his pants.
- No, I threw it.

750
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,820
Okay, I would like to
reiterate myself one more time.

751
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,480
My handkerchief was the 'R' flag.

752
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,300
- I was totally shocked.
- Did you bring this?

753
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,270
- Who took it?
- Give me the flagpole, Ji Sung.

754
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,330
- Why?
- I need to put it over there.

755
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,690
You're not supposed to be
carrying it around with you.

756
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,700
- I'll put it back.
- Okay.

757
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,490
I have a feeling that he put the handkerchief
in a place where he never should've put it.

758
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,890
- No, because that would be cheating.
- It's okay because I can still get it.

759
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,870
- It's okay, he can get it.
- I have no qualms about getting it.

760
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,170
I just stick my hands wherever
I need to.

761
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,560
But to tie the flag onto that pole would
result in a bit of a physical struggle.

762
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,690
Yes, but he needs to overcome that.

763
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,590
Yes, I understand what you mean.

764
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,030
I seriously had no idea that I've been
carrying the flag around with me all day.

765
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,360
See?
Everyone's starting to crowd around him.

766
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,670
[The Reactionary Duo makes their appearance.]

767
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,820
Take it from him.

768
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,420
[All sorts of hands starts to search
Ha Ha's body without any hesitation.]

769
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,740
Okay, fine.
Wait, hold off.

770
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,720
Wait, look at all the people
around me right now.

771
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,080
This is turning out to be
quite a scene right now.

772
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,840
But anyway,
I was quite shocked myself.

773
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,300
[Still unable to believe what just happened.]

774
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,940
I had no idea that
my handkerchief was the flag.

775
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,940
Run over that way right now.

776
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,580
[Ha Ha makes an attempt to flee.]

777
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,400
No, You can't take that with you!

778
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,710
No, You can't take that with you.
Wow, Ji Sung.

779
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,620
- What am I doing this for?
- Why are you taking that with you, Ji Sung?

780
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,090
[Why does he keep
lusting after the flagpole?]

781
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,580
- You have it on you, don't you?
- I think he has it.

782
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,780
- I think he has it on him.
- No, he doesn't.

783
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,520
[Second round of flag search.]

784
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,600
[Did Ha Ha somehow manage to hand
the flag over to Fabien during the melee?]

785
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,910
Hey, we have to play defense.

786
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,610
- Speak English.
- No, you can't speak in English.

787
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,720
- Did he find it?
- You can't speak in English.

788
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,840
- Someone found it, I think.
- You know where it is?

789
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,920
[How embarrassing to have them discuss their
plans in front of them and not understand.]

790
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,310
[Time to switch over to French.]

791
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,690
I have no clue what they're saying.

792
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,720
I feel really left out right now.

793
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,930
[Are they speaking in French?]

794
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,630
You speak French?

795
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,230
[Just what is going on here!]

796
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,660
[Unbelievable!
Ji Hoon knows how to speak French!]

797
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,110
Do you know what he just said to me?
He told me to get lost!

798
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,640
[Sorry, but that's all I know!]

799
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,340
Otswiri.

800
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,450
You're going to have to speak in Ghanaian.

801
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,980
[Attack of foreign language.]

802
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,730
What language are you all speaking in?
Why are you doing this in Choi Bu Ja's house?

803
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,880
Why are you doing this in
Choi Bu Ja's home?

804
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,870
- Okay, everyone.

- Why would you say his name?
- He kept saying Joong Ki's name.

Couldn't you say, 'coloring' instead?

No, I couldn't not answer it.
It was too obvious that it was curling.

We can't all become champions.

I will now explain
the rules of this competition.

1029
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,280
There are three members to each team.

1030
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,160
You have to choose who you think
wrote down the wrong answer

1031
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,400
by one member from each team stepping forward
to point out that person.

1032
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,750
And the other two members who are not
up here solving the question

1033
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,640
will just remain in the back
by your respective station.

1034
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,670
[One member per teams steps forward to solve
the question and the last team remaining wins.]

1035
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,860
Otswiri is up first.

1036
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,920
Defense players will write down
their answers to the question

1037
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,310
and the person on the attack will have to
choose who they think answered incorrectly.

1038
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,710
- Okay, who will Otswiri choose?
- Na Eun.

1039
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,990
Otswiri will choose one person whom he thinks
wrote down the wrong answer.

1040
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,050
If the person Otswiri chooses
wrote down the wrong answer

1041
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,480
then the person he chose will
receive a water shower.

1042
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,820
But if the person has the correct answer,
then Otswiri will be disqualified

1043
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,530
and receive the water shower instead.

1044
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:39,140
[In case of having written down
the wrong answer...]

1045
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,880
[This is... what'll happen to you.]

1046
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:56,540
[Son Na Eun is the first to be eliminated.]

1047
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,660
But Na Eun's makeup is totally waterproof.

1048
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,910
Her makeup isn't ruined whatsoever.

1049
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,410
<i>And with each question</i>

1050
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:11,600

which you've worked so hard to earn today.</i>

whenever they choose to.]

from having won the last round.

1053

[Otswiri maintains his attacker status
from having won the previous round.]

1054
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,670
And Na Eun's miniature towers now belongs to
Otswiri's team from having

1055
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,750
beat her in the previous round.

1056
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,820
If Otswiri happens to lose this round,
then both of his towers

1057
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,300
will go to the new winner.

1058
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,970
[If Otswiri loses, then both of his towers
will go to the new winner.]

1059
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,520
Bo Mi has stepped forward to
replace Na Eun for her team.

1060
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,850
But one can never guess
what the final results will be.

1061
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,460
Otswiri will now choose a category.

1062
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,590

Arts, History, Science, and Psychology.

1063

1064
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,060
Go with the arts category.

1065
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,980
- Linguistics.
- Linguistics!

1066
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,330
[Better for the attacker to choose
a more difficult category.]

1067
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,510
- Linguistics is your next category.
- I feel confident in this category.

1068
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,830
- Did you just say that you feel confident?
- Just a little.

1069
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,930
Okay, here's your question.

1070
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,890

of sumptuous abundance.</i>

1072
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,750
<i>In that case...</i>

<i>what do you call a meal that
simply consists of only a bowl of rice</i>

1074

<i>and only one or two side dishes
as the whole meal?</i>

1075

I know that you've all seen
the answer to this question before.

1076

[We've seen the answer to this
extremely difficult sounding question?]

1077

Okay, you all have 20 minutes
to study your questions.

not much time to memorize the answers.]

1083

Ji Hyo, you can't fall asleep.
You have to wake up, Ji Hyo.

1084

[Eureka!]

1085
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:21,490
With only one bowl of rice,
and a simple side dish or two...

1086
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:25,800
What do you call this simple
and humble meal table?

1087
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,680
You know this answer, right?

1088
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,430
Yes, maintaining
a stoic face is very important.

1089
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,300
[Who would've guessed the wrong answer?]

1090
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:39,780
[Escalate the chances of survival by pretending
to know the answer even if you don't.]

1091
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,000
[The attacker has a very confused
look on his face.]

1092
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,790
If I pretend not to know even if
I actually do know the answer

1093
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,460
then the chance to become the attacker
gets handed over to me, right?

1094
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,680
What?

1095
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,470
What are you talking about?

You seem not to know the rules whatsoever.

If you keep this up, then you have to
start over again from Kwangmyung Station.

1100

- Yes, I understand.
- Please be more cautious.

Bo Mi studies the book backwards.]

1110

[From having studied the material backwards,
would she know what the answer is?]

1111
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,510
- But this question wasn't in the back.
- It was somewhere in the middle, right?

1112
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,780
- No, it was in the front.
- It was towards the front.

1113

[So confusing!]

[What could he mean by that comment?]

1118
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,270
You can always use your chance card.

1119
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,410
You're always welcome to use
your chance card.

1120

What about Ms. Blank Ji Hyo?

1121
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,410
Don't you think that you're being
too overly confident right now?

1122
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,150
Why?
It's the correct answer.

- Did you memorize the answer?
- Yes, I have memorized the answer.

1126

Let me ask the others in the back.
Do you know the correct answer?

[Does Giraffe know
the correct answer to the question?]

No, that's not the correct answer.

1130

Okay, Otswiri will now make his selection.

1131

This is the nerve wrecking moment.

Just who...

1133
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,660
[If the person he chooses has the wrong answer
then that person is then eliminated.]

1134
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:02,560
[But if the person he chooses has the correct
answer then Otswiri will be eliminated.]

1135
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,880
[Who will Otswiri choose?]

1136
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,190
Song Ji Hyo.

1137
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,460
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Song Ji Hyo!

1138
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,510
We will take a moment to see what
others have wrote down for their answers.

1139
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,340
We will start off with Cha Yu Ram.

1140
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,150
Yes, just show us your answer.

1141
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,960
Jwi-ko Bapsang.
That is the correct answer.

1142
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,740
[Had she been chosen, then
Otswiri would've been eliminated.]

1143
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,510
Okay, Ji Sung.

1144
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,310
Jwi-ko Bapsang!
Correct answer.

1145
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,030
[What a relief!]

1146
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,670
[Time for Bo Mi to reveal her answer.]

1147
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,910
Simple bapsang!

1148
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:47,420
[Had Bo Mi been chosen,
then she would've been disqualified.]

1149
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,900
[Seeming nervous, the attacker
prepares himself for what may come.]

1150
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,800
We still don't know what the
outcome may be.

1151
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,970
We still don't know what Song Ji Hyo
has written down for her answer.

1152
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,380
Song Ji Hyo,
let's get the wrong answer!

1153
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,790
Okay, the correct answer is,
Jwi-ko Bapsang.

1154
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,860
Time to see if Song Ji Hyo
wrote down the correct answer!

1155
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,560
[What did Blank Ji write down for her answer?]

1156
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:18,050
[Otswiri vs Ji Hyo-
What is the result of their battle?]

1157
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,160
Jwi-ko Bapsang!

1158
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,060
[Waterfall!]

1159
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,560
Thus, Sam Otswiri is eliminated!

1160
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,350
[Ji Hyo wins Otswiri's two towers.]

1161
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,300
Now that Otswiri is eliminated

1162
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,790
all of his towers are now in
possession of Song Ji Hyo's team.

1163
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,470
[Ji Hyo is now the new attacker.]

1164
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,840
What are you all saving your
chance cards for?

1165
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,020
[Please start using your chance cards!]

1166
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:06,470
So far, Na Eun of Gary's team
has been eliminated

1167
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,600
and Sam Otswiri has been eliminated.

1168
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,360
Song Ji Hyo is now the new attacker.

1169
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,960
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

1170
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,330
Time to select the new category.

1171
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,230
- Psychology,
- Okay, psychology.

1172
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,690
Please give us the question.

1173
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,440
<i>What is the food that Casanova has said
is the best when seducing a woman?</i>

1174
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,040
People in the back can't say
what he answer is.

1175
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,790
People in the back can't say
what the answer is.

1176
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,130
I know what the answer is.

1177
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:41,670
Song Ji Hyo is the new attacker

1178
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:44,010
and she's watching the expression
on everyone's face right now.

1179
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,950
[Does Ji Sung know
what the correct answer is?]

1180
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,550
Can you repeat the question?

1181
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:56,960
<i>Okay, here's your question.</i>

1182
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:02,560
<i>What is the food that Casanova has said
is the best when seducing a woman?</i>

1183
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,030
Stir-fried anchovies.

1184
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:08,360
The four of you must now
write down your answers.

1185
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,160
Does everyone in the back
know the correct answer?

1186
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,120
Ha Ha, do you know the answer?

1187
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,890
You have to tell me what the answer is,
not tell me to go away.

1188
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:28,760
Okay? Tell me if you don't know the answer,
but don't tell me to go away.

1189
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:33,690
It's now time for Song Ji Hyo
to make her attack.

1190
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,410
Please choose whom you think
wrote down the incorrect answer.

1191
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,660
One, two, three.

1192
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,080
- Ji Sung.
- Okay, Ji Sung.

1193
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,300
Ji Sung's well known for being a romantic.

1194
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,390
She just chose to attack Ji Sung.

1195
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,800
Let's check other people's answers.
Bo Mi?

1196
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,350
Chocolates.

1197
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,660
- Fabien?
- She didn't fall for my trick.

1198
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,930
Chocolates.

1199
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,550
Cha Yu Ram?

1200
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,510
[Three people in a row wrote down
chocolates as their answers.]

1201
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,920
Ji Hyo.

1202
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,360
You thought this question was too easy,
and you yourself knew the correct answer.

1203
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,510
[Question was much easier than
she had expected...]

1204
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,470
[Correct answer- Chocolate.]

1205
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,640
Ji Sung!

1206
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,600
She's already preparing herself
for the water shower.

1207
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,600
Okay, Ji Sung.

1208
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,700
He really knows how to maintain
a poker face.

1209
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,760
One.

1210
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,860
[What is that expression on his face?]

1211
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,330
[A smile full of ease?]

1212
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:50,130
- I couldn't remember.
- He doesn't know!

1213
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,040
[Goodbye, Ji Sung.]

1214
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,980
[Song Ji Hyo's attack succeeds!]

1215
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,190
- Song Ji Hyo.
- How could you not have known that?

1216
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,230
What were you doing?
How could you not have remembered that?

1217
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,230
I'm so sorry!

1218
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,650
I couldn't remember!

1219
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,190
I saw Ji Sung earlier during
the study period

1220
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,780
and he was so focused on his studies
without even saying a single word.

1221
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,710
He really was so focused on his studies.

1222
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,000
Okay, let's study hard.

1223
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,610
[Ji Sung really was focused on his studies...]

1224
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,380
[I know everything else other than
the chocolate question.]

1225
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,390
Song Ji Hyo really is impressive with
her ability to read people.

1226
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:43,620
- I'm so proud of you!
- She chose one out of the four people.

1227
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,340
- That really is impressive.
- Fabien's bluff was amazing.

1228
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,060
Can you repeat the question?

1229
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,250
[Fabien bluffs to confuse Ji Hyo.]

1230
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,600
I knew he was faking because
he was so serious about it.

1231
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,930
As you may all have noticed already

1232
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,890
all the gold is starting to stack up
at Song Ji Hyo's feet again already.

1233
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,170
[The gold temples are coming home
to their rightful owner.]

1234
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,570
It's usually not the case when
it's just one gold prize on the line

1235
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,980
but when there's a lot of gold on the line
or a huge gold prize on the line

1236
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,340
then it's always Ji Hyo.

1237
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,730
Ji Sung is now eliminated.

1238
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,450
Now it's time for our next contestant,
Kwang Soo.

1239
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,930
[Ignorance is bliss-
Giraffe steps up to the plate.]

1240
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,960
[Giraffe's ability to last in these
types of games is a cause for concern.]

1241
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:31,520
[Song Ji Hyo- Eliminated.]

1242
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,090
[Bo Mi- Eliminated.]

1243
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,190
[Fabien- Eliminated.]

1244
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,330
[What in the world is going on?]

1245
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:49,970
Okay, the competition is really
starting to heat up.

1246
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,060
One team is already in danger
of being eliminated as a whole.

1247
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:56,260
Cha Yu Ram's team is the only team
with all the members still in the game.

1248
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,600
They are at a great advantage at the moment.

1249
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,730
We'll just use our chance card.

1250
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,210
Unless you use your chance card,
Yu Ram will continue to be the attacker.

1251
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,640
I will use my chance card to
steal her attacker position.

1252
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:14,960
[Ha Ha uses his MC Yoo chance card
to steal the attacker position.]

1253
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,470
Okay, Ha Ha.

1254
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,990
It's time for you to choose the category.

1255
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,740
Science.

1256
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:28,240
<i>It's a species of trees that grows in
a damp and humid environment.</i>

1257
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,300
<i>These trees provide fruits
which are sweet to the taste and the nose.</i>

1258
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,340
<i>Thus, fruits from these trees can either be
eaten raw or cooked.</i>

1259
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,440
<i>These trees also provide Chiclet,
which can be made into chewing gum.</i>

1260
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,070
<i>So what is the name of this tree?</i>

1261
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,040
Please write down the name
of these trees.

1262
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,120
I think this is going to be an easy question
to eliminate a player with.

1263
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,210
- Come on.
- What?

1264
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,640
[Is he laughing because Gary
wrote down an obviously wrong answer?]

1265
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:06,060
Okay, Ha Ha has the chance card which allows
him to see the first letter of the word.

1266
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,140
- So you can use this chance card.
- No, I don't want to use that.

1267
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,970
If you don't use this and
choose the wrong person

1268
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:12,040
then your team is done for.

1269
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,910
No, it's not being ridiculous to use it now.
If you don't pick the right person

1270
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,120
then it's all over for your team.

1271
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,310
- It's obvious who it's going to be.
- Really?

1272
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,860
[Could it be this guy?]

1273
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,550
[Or him?]

1274
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:29,060
Okay, then please make your selection.

1275
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,940
You two play rock-paper-scissors.

1276
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,040
[Play for who's going to get
the water shower?]

1277
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,450
I really hope that he chooses me.

1278
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,320
[Is he trying to play reverse psychology?]

1279
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:47,660
Lee Kwang Soo, your face is beet red.
Why is your face so red?

1280
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,200
[Kwang Soo's extremely red face.]

1281
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,860
You want to get picked?

1282
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,110
Don't pick either one of us.

1283
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,990
Okay, who is it going to be?

1284
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:09,760
[Time for Ha Ha to attack
and make his selection.]

1285
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,500
Huh Kyung Hwan.

1286
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,610
- Ha Ha, I really know the answer.
- Okay.

1287
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,420
Okay, we'll start with Cha Yu Ram.
Cha Yu Ram?

1288
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,330
[Cha Yu Ram to reveal her answer first.]

1289
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:26,040
- I got really confused.
- Let's see your answer.

1290
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:35,210
[Focused like she focuses on her sport-
Studies with a laser sharp focus.]

1291
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,320
[Chewing gum tree- Sapodilla tree.]

1292
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,200
Chewing gum tree is the correct answer.

1293
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,880
- Is there even such a thing?
- Yes.

1294
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,970
- Correct answer is, chewing gum tree.
- I guarantee...

1295
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:49,630
[I'm telling you that I know the answer'.]

1296
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,630
I bet every penny I have!
He definitely doesn't know the answer.

1297
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,820
[Ha Ha is too happy about his attack?]

1298
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,380
[He could have the right answer...]

1299
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,000
Okay, let's see Gary's answer.

1300
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,150
He got the correct answer!
The chewing gum tree!

1301
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,420
I can be pretty random like that.

1302
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,380
Okay, next.

1303
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,050
Next up is, Lee Kwang Soo.

1304
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,180
Coconut?

1305
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,200
[He doesn't disappoint.]

1306
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,120
I was going to swing out with an upper cut
when I just saw your answer.

1307
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,070
I'm just not familiar with this category.

1308
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,190
- I just didn't know.
- You don't know the answer to anything.

1309
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,940
[Please Kwang Soo...]

1310
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,160
- I'm not even nervous about this.
- Let's check and see his answer.

1311
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,120
- Huh Kyung Hwan?
- Who doesn't know the answer to this?

1312
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:39,670
Let's see what you have wrote down
for your answer.

1313
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,650
[Time to check Kyung Hwan's answer.]

1314
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,840
[Oh?]

1315
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,800
[He couldn't possibly...]

1316
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,960
What kind of a tree?
[Totally ridiculous answer.]

1317
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,650
[Goodbye...]

1318
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,300
[Ha Ha's attack succeeds.]

1319
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:12,250
I was pushed back here by the water.

1320
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:16,370
- I really don't want to get hit by the water.
- Ha Ha gets the towers!

1321
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:20,100
[Ha Ha is given the possession of
Kyung Hwan's towers.]

1322
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,140
[Team Beautiful's Baek Sung Hyun
takes the stage.]

1323
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,580
Ha Ha still has the attacker position.

1324
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,490
Please select your next category.

1325
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:32,680
- Common sense.
- Okay, common sense.

1326
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,210
Please give us the next question.

1327
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:38,250
<i>The '@' mark,
which is used when emailing someone</i>

1328
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,070
<i>is commonly known as,
the 'snail' in our country.</i>

1329
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:44,360
<i>In Denmark, they refer to that mark
as the 'Elephant nose'.</i>

1330
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:47,570
<i>In Hungary, they refer to the mark as
the 'Worm'.</i>

1331
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:52,020
<i>In that case, what is the mark referred
to as in the Netherlands?</i>

1332
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,930
I know this one.
I remember studying this one.

1333
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,540
You know the answer to this one?
What is it?

1334
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,900
Ha Ha does know the answer.

1335
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,680
[Even Ha Ha knows the answer
to this question!]

1336
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,210
Na Eun does know the correct answer!

1337
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:17,280
[What is the '@' mark referred to as
in the Netherlands?]

1338
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,670
[Correct answer- Monkey's tail.]

1339
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:26,110
Shall we check your answer?
Do you know what it is?

1340
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,550
[MC Yoo checks the answer.]

1341
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,150
It's time to send Kwang Soo out.

1342
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,730
Don't you think that Kwang Soo
probably doesn't know what it is?

1343
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,680
I just memorized all the answers.

1344
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,620
How can you memorize all the answers
without knowing the questions?

1345
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,290
[Even his own teammate
has no response to that.]

1346
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,550
How can he memorize the answers without
knowing what he question is?

1347
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:53,370
[Is that the Giraffe's special secret?]

1348
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,400
So I'll get the water shower if
everyone gets the correct answer?

1349
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,900
- Shall we check the answers?
- That question was way too easy.

1350
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:01,280
If Ha Ha doesn't choose the right person,
then it's the end for him and his team.

1351
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,080
This is no time to save your chance card.

1352
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,970
- I'll use my chance card.
- Okay.

1353
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:09,920
[MC Yoo's chance card is used to check
the first letter of the word.]

1354
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,050
- Can you only see the first letter?
- But I can see everyone's first word, right?

1355
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,490
I'll be taking a look at the answers
to let you know what the first letter is.

1356
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,380
You can only choose two teams.

1357
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,520
Which teams will you choose?
You can only choose two.

1358
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:27,300
- Look at the expression on their faces.
- Get Kwang Soo out of the game.

1359
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,090
Take a good look at their expressions.

1360
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,230
Okay, let's go with Kwang Soo first.

1361
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,960
Kwang Soo and...

1362
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,250
Cha Yu Ram.

1363
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,380
We'll start with Kwang Soo,
and I'll let you know the first letter.

1364
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,010
[Answer- Monkey's tail.
MC Yoo takes a look.]

1365
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,840
Won.
(Won-soong-Yi= Monkey.)

1366
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:52,890
[Then there's a high chance that
he probably has the correct answer.]

1367
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,860
First letter of her word is... won.

1368
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,590
[Yu Ram's first letter is also, 'won'.]

1369
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,400
No!

1370
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,440
Even if they both have the same letter,
wouldn't Kwang Soo be a better chance?

1371
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:11,180
[That's the truth.]

1372
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,430
It's time for Ha Ha to make his decision.

1373
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:18,200
Could this be the first question to which
Kwang Soo knows the correct answer to?

1374
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,260
[Come on!]

1375
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,910
I think everyone knows.
I think everyone knows the answer.

1376
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:34,150
Three, two, one.

1377
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,930
[Ha Ha's turn to choose and
make the attack.]

1378
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,410
Baek Sung Hyun!

1379
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,580
Could he have answered incorrectly?

1380
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,650
Okay, time to check Bae Sung Hyun's answer.

1381
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,760
Okay, time to check Bae Sung Hyun's answer.

1382
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,540
[An unreadable expression.]

1383
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,520
[Young Sung Hyun showed just how
competitive he could be.]

1384
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:13,730
[Even though others joked around him,
he showed how focused he can be.]

1385
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,820
Okay, time to check Bae Sung Hyun's answer.

1386
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,880
[Bae Sung Hyun's answer]

1387
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,130
- Monkey's tail.
- That's the correct answer!

1388
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,270
That's the correct answer!

1389
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,230
[Kiddie monkey gets soaked.]

1390
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:40,500
Thus, Otswiri, Fabien and Ha Ha
are eliminated as a team!

1391
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,080
[The other teams break out in cheer.]

1392
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:49,210
[Sung Hyun now possesses three towers
and the position to attack.]

1393
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:51,250
- This is the first answer Kwang Soo knew.
- Monkey's tail.

1394
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,790
[Giraffe knew the answer!]

1395
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,810
Sung Hyun.
It's time to select your category.

1396
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,040
- I'll go with, Global.
- Global.

1397
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,890
<i>Here's your question.</i>

1398
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:10,000
<i>Even though this act is tabooed in India
since it's viewed as an act of insult...</i>

1399
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,370
<i>but in our country, it's viewed as a
type of drinking game.</i>

1400
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,180
<i>What is this act the question is referring to?</i>

1401
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,740
Please write down the act.

1402
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,500
It's time for you to choose a team.

1403
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,040
I'd like to use my chance card.

1404
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,170
[Using MC Yoo's chance card to
eliminate one team.]

1405
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,990
This is the chance card to tell which
team has written down as the answer.

1406
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:40,440
Okay, I will let you know which team you pick
has the correct or the incorrect answer.

1407
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,350
Cha Yu Ram.

1408
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,660
[Chooses Cha Yu Ram.]

1409
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,600
Okay, Cha Yu Ram's answer is...

1410
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,850
'Wink'.
It's the correct answer.

1411
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:54,870
[Cha Yu Ram has the correct answer.]

1412
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:59,030
Okay, you have to choose
one of the other two teams.

1413
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,500
[Sung Hyun to choose one of
the other two teams.]

1414
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:05,290
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo!

1415
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:15,610
Kwang Soo hasn't had a single correct answer
except for the recent monkey's tail.

1416
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:19,300
[Could the Giraffe pull off another miracle?]

1417
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,010
Let's check Gary's answer.

1418
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,730
[Time to check Gary's answer.]

1419
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,430
- I didn't know.
- He didn't know!

1420
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,760
- Gary didn't know the answer.
- But you're always out drinking.

1421
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,490
But I don't usually wink at anyone.

1422
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,730
I've been keeping my eye on Gary

1423
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:37,300
and this is the first time that Gary
hasn't provided the correct answer.

1424
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,800
So it's now Kwang Soo's turn.

1425
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,620
Please show us your answer!

1426
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:47,330
[Could the Giraffe pull off another miracle?]

1427
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,820
- This is really hard.
- Yeah, it looks hard.

1428
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,620
I think I'm just going to
memorize the answers.

1429
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:55,800
What use is it if you only
memorize the answers?

1430
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:01,600
[A special technique used only
by the Giraffe.]

1431
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,380
[He only... memorized the answers!]

1432
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,900
Please show us your answer!

1433
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:16,060
[Giraffe only memorized the answers
during the study period.]

1434
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:23,260
[Did he memorize the answer?]

1435
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,620
Wink!

1436
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,700
[Correct answer!]

1437
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,670
[Crap!]

1438
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,300
[Sung Hyun falls trap to Kwang Soo's trick!]

1439
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:43,590
Wink!

1440
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,220
How can this be?

1441
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,440
[Team Beautiful eliminated as a whole.]

1442
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,010
I was wrong about you, Kwang Soo.
I'm sorry.

1443
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:00,420
[Shocking new contender of the Quiz Battle.]

1444
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:05,340
Wow... this really is unexpected.

1445
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,050
I think it's time...
to show what I'm truly made of.

1446
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,560
There are people who are good test takers
even if they're not normally good students.

1447
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,380
[Giraffe is just a good test taker?]

1448
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:20,030
Lee Kwang Soo finally
has the attack position.

1449
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,800
This really is unexpected.

1450
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,090
Cha Yu Ram still is in the lead
with all the members still in the game.

1451
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:30,050
Kwang Soo, please choose your category.

1452
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,680
- Art!
- Okay, art.

1453
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,480
Okay, here's your question.

1454
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:44,360
What is the skill called when a glyph
is hand drawn freestyle?

1455
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:58,080
[Answer- Calligraphy.]

1456
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,890
[Did everyone memorize the correct answer?]

1457
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,130
But what Kwang Soo needs
to really think about

1458
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:08,540
is that Joo Ji Hoon is still left
remaining on his team.

1459
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:13,890
So he must carefully use his chance card to
surpass the team that's currently in the lead.

1460
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,460
Why are you saying things like that?

1461
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,610
- Are you going to use your chance card?
- I'm going to use my chance card.

1462
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:21,480
Which chance card would you like to use?

1463
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:24,990
The chance to be notified of
one of the incorrect answers.

1464
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,160
- Chance to be notified of the wrong answer.
- Let you know if there's a wrong answer.

1465
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,700
[If MC Yoo sees an incorrect answer,
then notify the attacker of it.]

1466
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,460
[Are there no wrong answers?]

1467
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:44,620
I'll know who has the wrong answer
if you just tell me if there even is one.

1468
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,650
- See if you can guess who it is.
- Okay.

1469
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,340
One person's answer is,
Sign Language.

1470
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:52,210
[One of the two answered,
Sign Language.]

1471
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:56,260
- Am I free to choose now?
- Yes, please make your selection.

1472
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:00,220
Who would've ever thought that
a day like this would come to find Kwang Soo?

1473
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,680
[Think of this as your one and only day,
and enjoy it while you can.]

1474
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,430
Use one more chance card.

1475
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,290
I don't know what chances you have,
but use it.

1476
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,510
[Both defense players avoid
meeting Kwang Soo's gaze.]

1477
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,250
- This is a very crucial selection process.
- Can I use another chance card?

1478
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:14,740
- No, don't use it.
- Yes, you may use it.

1479
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:19,290
[Going to use another chance card
to ensure his successful attack?]

1480
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,580
- I'm going to use another chance card.
- What is it?

1481
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,280
The chance to see the future!

1482
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:29,400
MC Yoo to tell me how many people
has the incorrect answer.

1483
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,720
You are so stupid!

1484
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,740
That's pretty much the same thing!

1485
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,810
I told you not to use it.

1486
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:39,890
You really are using
your chance card so uselessly.

1487
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:43,710
So I have to let you know how many correct
and incorrect answers there are?

1488
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,690
There are...

1489
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,060
no correct answers.

1490
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:58,380
Then couldn't you have just used that one
in the first place?

1491
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:01,510
[Just leave me alone!]

1492
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,330
[They both have incorrect answers!
Who will Giraffe choose to eliminate?]

1493
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,490
What are you even hesitating about?
You have to eliminate her!

1494
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:18,400
It's not a bad idea to go one on one either.

1495
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,180
That's ridiculous.
All their members are still alive.

1496
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,370
[Who will Kwang Soo choose?]

1497
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:24,520
Cha Yu Ram!

1498
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,370
[Team Sports All-Stars' first elimination.]

1499
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,830
Calligraphy is the correct answer.

1500
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:44,730
[What a moment for the Giraffe!
A total of 11 gold towers!]

1501
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:49,970
Even though Kwang Soo was able to save
his team from a moment of danger

1502
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:53,390
on the other hand, he totally wasted away
both of the team's chance cards.

1503
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,690
[A total waste of the chance cards.]

1504
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:01,860
[So as his punishment...
he's eliminated at the very next round.]

1505
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:08,240
[The true face of tragedy.]

1506
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,460
Ji Suk Jin and Kim Jong Kook are still alive
for Team Sports All-Stars

1507
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:19,330
and Gary and Joo Ji Hoon are the only ones
left remaining for their respective teams.

1508
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,890
It's time for Gary to make his attack.

1509
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,180
[Gary, Jong Kook, Ji Hoon-
Down to the wire!]

1510
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:32,360
- Literature.
- Okay, Literature.

1511
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,880
Okay, here's your literature question.

1512
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,790
<i>Irish poet, William Yates...</i>

1513
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,800
<i>I really studied this category too.</i>

1514
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:50,620
<i>What was he referring to when he said,
'Mistake of an angel'?</i>

1515
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:54,270
- This isn't that hard.
- Shall I take a look?

1516
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,140
[Correct answer- Dimples.]

1517
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:09,320
- I'd like to use MC Yoo's chance card.
- The chance to see the future.

1518
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:13,360
[Uses the chance card to see
how many incorrect answers there are.]

1519
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,740
There are...

1520
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:25,000
[A precise and useful chance card-
How many incorrect answers are there?]

1521
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,140
There are...

1522
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,920
Two correct answers.

1523
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,740
[Two correct answers.]

1524
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,120
- There aren't any wrong answers?
- No, there aren't any wrong answers.

1525
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,100
Goodbye.

1526
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:45,420
[Shower right now.]

1527
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:51,570
Thus, Son Na Eun, Bo Mi and Gary
are all eliminated as a team.

1528
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:55,910
Now there are only three people left with
Joo Ji Hoon, Ji Suk Jin, and Kim Jong Kook.

1529
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:59,400
[Team Film Stars- One vs
Team Sports All-Stars- Two.]

1530
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,000
Okay, Joo Ji Hoon!

1531
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,760
<i>Let's go home nice and dry.</i>

1532
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,180
<i>Let's not get wet,
and go home nice and dry.</i>

1533
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:11,760
As the rules states,
category can no longer be selected.

1534
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,540
If you both answer incorrectly,
then we'll move on to the next question.

1535
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,920
Okay, let's give these two
a huge round of applause!

1536
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,830
[The final battle between
Team Film Stars and Team Sports All-Stars.]

1537
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:26,970
Who will take home 15 gold towers?
Please give out the next question.

1538
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,470
<i>In the royal court
during the Joseon era</i>

1539
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,530
<i>a king's face was referred to as 'Yong-Ahn',
his lips, 'Goo-Soon'</i>

1540
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:37,640
<i>and his farts, 'Ventilation'.</i>

1541
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,760
<i>In that case, what did they refer to
the king's stool as?</i>

1542
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,990
This is the question that could
change it all!

1543
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:48,340
The answer to this question
was actually even in a movie.

1544
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,920
'Yong-Byun' is incorrect.

1545
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,680
Okay, time to reveal your answers.

1546
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,280
'Mae-hwa' and 'Ki-chim'.

1547
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,050
['Ki-chim' vs 'Mae-hwa'.]

1548
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,120
One of the two answered correctly.

1549
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,630
The correct answer is...

1550
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,170
Mae-hwa!

1551
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,960
[Tiger is eliminated.]

1552
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,360
Mae-hwa.

1553
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,860
Joon Ji Hoon's 'Joo', Ji Sung Ji's 'Ji',
Lee Kwang Soo's 'Soo'!

1554
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,320
Joo-Ji-Soo!

1555
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,580
[We are, Joo-Ji-Soo!]

1556
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,930
It's now Ji Suk Jin's turn at the podium.
Will be he able to go home in dry clothes?

1557
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,020
[Dry Big-nose finally takes his stand.]

1558
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,080
I already feels nervous for him.

1559
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:51,190

[The final face-off.]

01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:03,610
[Ji Suk Jin vs Joo Ji Hoon.]

1562
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,850
[Question with the victory of
the Quiz Battle hanging on the line.]

1563
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:13,190
<i>A lone man in the midst of many women
is referred to as, 'The Only man'</i>

1564
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:17,060
<i>and a lone woman in the midst of many men
are referred to as, 'The Only woman'.</i>

1565
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,770
<i>'The only woman' means,
the single red blossom.</i>

1566
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,560
<i>- So which flower blossom does it refer to?
- Write down the type of flower.</i>

1567
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,510
I know this answer!
I have to remember it!

1568
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,480
I'm not positive if this is the right answer.

1569
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:33,160
Ji Suk Jin has written down his answer.

1570
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:41,290

01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,810
Sorry, but I memorize better
when I say it out loud.

Red pomegranate flower.]
