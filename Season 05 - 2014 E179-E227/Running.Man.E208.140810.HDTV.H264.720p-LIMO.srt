Hello, it's a beautiful morning.

00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,277
Hello.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,984
<i>Here is your first mission.</i>

11
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:19,086
[Everyone starts
their first mission on their own.]

00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh. Hallyu star race.

13
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:24,511
<i>A race with the top Hallyu stars.</i>

14
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,538
Choose between the two Hallyu stars, and
go to the location where one of them waits.

15
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,350
Choose between the two Hallyu stars...

16
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:38,304
[Choose the Hallyu star whom
they are a fan of!]

17
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,950
Wow, so we're going to meet
a Hallyu star?

18
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,798
But we're Hallyu stars too, aren't we?

Southern end of the Seokang Bridge.]

22
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,701
Hallyu giraffe?

23
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:05,131
Kwang Soo's not a Hallyu star.

24
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,161
Hallyu giraffe.

25
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:10,082
Giraffe?
That giraffe of ours?

26
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:14,879
This has to be a total dud.
This one is a total dud, isn't it?

27
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:18,112
Rabbit.

28
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,297
Who could this rabbit be?

29
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,127
Who wore the rabbit mask?

30
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:31,648
I know that there was a rabbit.
Impala, tiger, grasshopper...

31
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,266
Gary was the monkey.

32
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,255
- Hey, Gary.
- Where are you going to go, Suk Jin?

33
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,117
<i>I'm going to go to the rabbit.</i>

34
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:45,718
I have this feeling that the rabbit
is going to be really cute.

35
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,097
- Ji Hyo?
- No, I said, I think the rabbit will be cute.

36
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,715
Ah, you think the rabbit will be cute?

37
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,655
I've made my decision.

38
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:02,173
Giraffe!
Rabbit!

39
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:04,599
- Which one?
- Giraffe!

40
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,377
Rabbit!

41
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:11,880
I'm positive that everyone's
going to go to the southern end.

42
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:15,425
The rabbit is going to be a girl, isn't it?

43
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:19,532
I know who the giraffe is going to be,
but I'm not sure about the rabbit.

44
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:25,279
I'm too uncertain to trust the rabbit.
I'm nervous that it'll be Song Ji Hyo.

45
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:28,313
Let's just get going.
But where are we right now?

46
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,695
I slept the whole way here,
so I'm not sure where we are right now.

47
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:35,919
Are you studying right now?
You're not one of our staff members, are you?

48
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,675
I thought you were one of
our staff members.

49
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,455
I'm sorry for disturbing your studies.

50
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,227
This is how we usually start off.

51
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:49,616
I'm positive I know who
the giraffe is going to be.

52
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:53,320
And since I personally really like rabbits,
I'm going to go see the rabbit.

53
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,322
[Blank Ji is a fan of Hallyu rabbits.]

54
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:58,669
Forget it.

55
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,102
Let's just go.

56
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:05,140
I think I should go see the giraffe.
Because the rabbit...

57
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:09,474
It's possible that the rabbit could be a ruse,
and I might be on the losing end by going.

58
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,144
Oh, you girls startled me.

59
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,216
- What are you ladies doing?
- Are you for real?

60
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:21,896
Can I shake your hand?
Are you exercising or something?

61
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:23,666
- Are you out exercising?
- Yes.

62
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,740
- Then why aren't you exercising?
- Can we get a picture?

63
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,150
Wouldn't it be more meaningful
to be in the picture together?

64
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,952
We should be in the picture together.

65
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:33,562
Wait, you forgot to take this!

66
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:38,911
[What bashful couple of girls...]

67
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:41,423
Bye, ladies!

68
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:44,240
Have a nice workout.

69
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,249
That was funny.
Those girls are really funny.

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,427
Those girls were so cute.

71
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,868
Ugh, I don't know where to go.

72
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:55,196
Your gut instinct is always the right one.
The Hallyu rabbit.

73
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,312
Okay, let's get going.

74
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,500
I want to go to the northern end
of the Seokang bridge.

75
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,937
It's past Mapo-Gu near Sinjungdong.

76
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:09,419
[Hallyu giraffe or Hallyu rabbit-
Decision making process is now complete.]

77
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,776
[With the exception of Jong Kook and Jae Suk,
everyone else decides to go to the rabbit.]

78
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:18,120
South and North...

79
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:21,168
So it must be across from each other.
Someone is trying to call me.

80
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:24,940
Song Ji Hyo is calling me.
She can't be calling me right now.

81
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,122
Hey, Ji Hyo.

82
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,244
- Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

83
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:34,169
- Where are you right now?
- I'm headed out somewhere right now.

84
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,145
Ah, you're already on the move?

85
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,972
- Yeah, I'm on the move.
- Okay, Jong Kook.

86
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,746
Hurry, okay?

87
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:50,582
After that phone call from Ji Hyo...
I don't think Ji Hyo is the rabbit.

88
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:57,401
So it makes me wonder if it'll be a good idea
to check and see who the rabbit is.

89
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:01,259
So I think I may go to the
southern end now.

90
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,277
[Jae Suk heads to the northern end
all by his lonesome.]

91
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:20,155
[Jae Suk arrives at the northern end
where Hallyu Giraffe awaits his arrival.]

92
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:30,415
[The piano melody can be heard
playing softly from the tent.]

93
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:40,094
[A romantic melody that can be heard
along the banks of Han River.]

94
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:49,098
[Where this piano melody can be heard from...]

95
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:59,637
[In this place...
a Hallyu giraffe awaits.]

96
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:03,169
[Could it... really be Kwang Soo?]

97
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,637
[On the southern end,
a Hallyu rabbit also lies in wait.]

98
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,219
[Gary is the first one to arrive.]

99
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,066
Am I the first one to arrive?
Am I the first?

100
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,387
I'm suddenly feeling a little bit bashful.

101
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,332
I suddenly feel really
embarrassed and nervous.

102
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,718
- Are you the only one here?
- Yes.

103
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,180
[Old man Big-nose,
and Muscle boy Kkuk also arrive.]

104
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,430
Do you think this is what our fans feel like
when they come to our fan meetings?

105
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,463
- Feeling this nervous energy?
- Are you nervous?

106
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,584
Yes, I'm nervous.
Who's that?

107
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:43,545
[All the fans rush over
to meet their Hallyu rabbit.]

108
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,415
[Everyone with the exception of Jae Suk
arrives to meet the Hallyu rabbit.]

109
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,217
I'm so curious to find out who the rabbit is.
I thought you were going to be the rabbit.

110
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:54,701
- No, I'm not the rabbit.
- I knew you weren't it when you called.

111
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,501
Welcome to all of you who made it
here to meet your Hallyu rabbit.

112
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,942
Thank you.

113
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:02,378
Hallyu rabbit, whom I'm sure all of you
are curious to find out about...

114
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,013
Okay, it's time to meet the Hallyu rabbit.

115
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:08,657
Please welcome our Hallyu rabbit who has
become a household name.

116
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:13,309
She'll soon be making her appearance.

117
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,452
- Hallyu rabbit!
- Look at all the bubbles!

118
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,180
I'm positive that it's a girl.

119
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:22,179
[A pink heart in the midst
of all the floating bubbles.]

120
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,140
- Rabbit!
- Look at all the bubbles!

121
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,933
[At last...]

122
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,595
[It's the moment where they get to meet
the Hallyu rabbit they've been waiting for.]

123
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,656
[It's Suzy!]

124
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,984
[The goddess of Asia- Suzy.]

125
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:57,038
Rabbit!
It's Suzy!

126
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,072
[Everyone rushes forward to greet Suzy.]

127
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,382
[Welcome Suzy onto the show!]

128
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,675
You look prettier every time I see you!

129
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,703
[Sensible enough to greet everyone
with a cheerful high-five.]

130
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:20,116
- Are you the sign of the rabbit?
- No, I'm the sign of the dog.

131
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,402
- Then why are you a rabbit?
- Because she's cute as a rabbit.

132
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:25,242
- And her front teeth are like a rabbit's.
- Is that why?

133
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:29,631
- Yes, I've heard that a lot of people.
- All rabbits should now be called 'Suzy'.

134
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:32,573
So all of us are Suzy's fans today.

135
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,959
This is like a fan meeting.

136
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:40,035
Why... how are you this pretty?

137
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,446
- How do you get prettier every day?
- What's your secret?

138
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,351
We're not giving you lip service right now.

139
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,545
How could she have gotten
so much prettier just in the past year?

140
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,139
Yes, you're so much prettier than last year.

141
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,996
- Then the other one really must be Kwang Soo?
- Jae Suk is the only one there?

142
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:58,384
[In that case...]

143
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:05,373
[At the other end of the bridge-
It's the Hallyu giraffe and Jae Suk.]

144
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:07,449
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

145
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:21,699
[Could... the Hallyu giraffe...
really be Kwang Soo?]

146
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:33,332
[Curiosity... killed the cat.]

147
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:40,335
[Our very own Prince of Asia,
Lee Kwang Soo.]

148
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,420
[Fitting of the moment...]

149
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:52,786
- What are you doing!
- Jae Suk!

150
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,536
- I was serenading you!
- What are you doing right now!

151
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:58,172
- Jae Suk, it's a Hallyu star special.
- Do you want a beating?

152
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:02,748
You called me way out here...
a taxi won't even come out here!

153
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,640
What do you think you're doing!
You are such a schemer!

154
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,712
You called me way out here
for this?

155
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:11,095
- What are you doing?
- Just wait, we have more fans coming.

156
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:14,139
[Hallyu Giraffe isn't aware that
no more people will be showing up.]

157
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,451
I only came here because I didn't know
who the Rabbit was going to be.

158
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:20,139
I knew you'd come.
You're the first guest to show up.

159
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,479
Thank you to my first fan.

160
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:26,145
How am I your first fan?

161
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,633
If I have to choose just one moment
when I've felt the happiest...

162
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:32,011
then it would be this moment
that I get to spend with my fan.

163
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:40,502
- What are you doing?
- What did you do that for?

164
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,078
[He just wanted to touch the face
of this Hallyu star.]

165
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,670
[The Hallyu star wave.]

166
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,578
Put your hand down!

167
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,988
Everyone, I now have a girlfriend.
You want to know who that is?

168
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,514
My girlfriend is none other than...
all you ladies out there.

169
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,206
- What are you doing, Jae Suk!
- Knock it off!

170
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,876
- What are you doing!
- Just knock it off!

171
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:04,052
- This is my fan meeting!
- I'm not your fan!

172
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,244
- No, you are my fan.
- No, I'm not your fan.

173
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:09,856
I don't know who else will be coming,
so please be a little bit more patient.

174
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:12,620
- I could be the only one.
- No, that can't be true.

175
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,296
Who's the Hallyu Rabbit?
I came here only because I didn't know.

176
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,354
I don't know either.

177
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,944
<i>All the members have arrived
at the other side.</i>

178
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,928
<i>- The fan meeting is now over.
- What?</i>

179
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,700
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, you are Kwang Soo's
only fan.</i>

180
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,918
- You're the only one.
- What?

181
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,624
Who's the Hallyu Rabbit?

182
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,390
<i>It's Suzy.</i>

183
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:38,005
[Seriously angry.]

184
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:41,132
- I can't even pick my own team?
- Suzy!

185
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:44,646
- Suzy!
- Suzy! I wanted to pick Hallyu Rabbit!

186
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,966
- Can I go back to Suzy?
- Where do you think you're going?

187
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:51,904
Suzy texted me a couple of days ago,
but I never got to text her back.

188
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,520
- There's no way you got a text from her!
- I have to go to Suzy.

189
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,674
You schemer! I'm missing my
time with Suzy because of you!

190
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,158
- Is it really Suzy?
- Is it really Suzy?

191
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,698
- Suzy!
- Suzy, I'm sorry!

192
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,444
Suzy!

193
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,298
Suzy, I'm sorry!

194
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,832
[Can you see her?
Suzy's smiling on the other side.]

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,171
[One the other side of the river,
people here are on cloud nine.]

196
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:22,415
<i>This show is Prince of Asia,
Lee Kwang Soo's fans...</i>

197
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,670
<i>vs the goddess of the Hallyu wave,
Suzy's fans.</i>

198
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:32,511
[Hallyu star race.]

199
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:37,550
<i>The race will take place by utilizing public
transportation in the city of Seoul.</i>

200
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:44,271
<i>The team that passes the mission first will
be given a chance card for winning.</i>

201
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:50,959
<i>The Hallyu star of the winning team can
bring someone on from the other team.</i>

202
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:55,134
<i>Or the winning star also has the choice
to kick someone off their team.</i>

203
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,904
This is dangerous because
Jae Suk is on the other team.

204
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,858
<i>Or you also have the choice to keep
the team just as it is right now.</i>

205
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,362
You have to keep it as is.
It can't get any better than this.

206
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,297
- Please choose your mode of transportation.
- Go get it, Kwang Soo.

207
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:14,231
[Team Giraffe- Bus vs
Team Rabbit- Subway.]

208
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,341
It's the subway!

209
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,264
[Nation's first love, whom men
all around the world fell in love with.]

210
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:25,189
[Goddess of our nation, Team Suzy.]

211
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:28,497
[Prince of Asia...]

212
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,156
[Prince of Asia, Team Giraffe.]

213
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,957
[A fierce competition!]

214
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,123
Our uniforms have a Hawaiian feel to them.

215
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:41,451
- This is supposed to be a fan meeting.
- You're right.

216
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:45,076
So we're dressed the part,
as if we're going to a fan meeting.

217
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,844
Should we come up with
a name for our fan club?

218
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,374
- How about Suzy's Club?
- We love Suzy?

219
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,222
- What do you think?
- How about... 'A day of Suzy'?

220
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,282
Okay, A day of Suzy.

221
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,908
Yes, it really is a day of Suzy.

222
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,561
I feel like we've just won
the lotto or something.

223
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:03,754
So it's like a special date
with the star or something.

224
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:07,131
[A dream-like date
with the goddess of Hallyu.]

225
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:17,698
[Just having Suzy by their side...
is more than they could've asked for.]

226
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,674
We can take those stairs over there.

227
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,664
[Makes their way to the subway station.]

228
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,829
We have to get some ice cream
later too, okay?

229
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,155
- Your treat, okay?
- Okay, it'll be my treat.

230
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,506
- Are you filming any movies right now?
- Movie?

231
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:39,383
- Yes, I'm going to start filming soon.
- No, don't do it!

232
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:42,572
There's probably going to be
a kiss scene in the movie!

233
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,668
- A kiss scene?
- Don't do it.

234
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,437
- We're not going to be able to stand that.
- Let's be supportive of her career.

235
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:53,863
- Let's accept her stardom.
- What are you saying right now?

236
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,336
[Sincerity of a true fan.]

237
00:15:56,337 --> 00:16:00,410
- We have to be supportive of her.
- Don't you have a lot of older male fans?

238
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,471
- I'm not sure.
- I bet you do.

239
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,458
[Astounded by the sight of
Suzy in the subway station.]

240
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:15,188
- Let's take a look over here.
- This is set up like the airport.

241
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,891
[That's our ace!
Blank Ji calmly takes a look at the route.]

242
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,574
- We can take this one.
- Okay, let's get on the train.

243
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:24,066
- Let's get on the subway.
- I bet Kwang Soo's team is pretty depressed.

244
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,320
Can you buy me something to eat?

245
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,608
I don't have any money.

246
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,736
Don't you have any money?
Seriously?

247
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:40,142
- Look here...
- I'm going to kick you off my team.

248
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:43,246
Yes, do it!
Please kick me off your team.

249
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:47,089
Because I really want to go.
I want to go to Suzy.

250
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,721
It makes me so angry that I have no way
of getting you back right now!

251
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm your one and only fan right now.

252
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,429
- I'm your one and only fan for the day.
- Thank you.

253
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:09,264
[A one on one date with the Giraffe...
A dream he wishes he could snap out of...]

254
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:16,265
Buy me something to eat! Don't
you think that you're being too stingy?

255
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,025
No, I've made up my mind.
I'm definitely kicking you off the team.

256
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,805
- I'm definitely going to kick you off.
- Then you'll be left all alone.

257
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,545
A star can't exist without their fans.

258
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,482
Ugh, seriously.
You can't be a star without your fan.

259
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,410
- I wasn't thinking clearly, I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

260
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:35,196
Hello ladies.

261
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,069
- Hi girls.
- Where are you girls going?

262
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:40,023
- We're going to school.
- Aren't you on summer vacation?

263
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:43,717
You're going to school even though
you're on summer vacation?

264
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:48,013
- Do you want an autograph?
- We're heading to Sang-Su Station right now.

265
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:51,751
Do you know how we can get to
Seonyu Park from that station?

266
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,617
- Do you know?
- No.

267
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:58,533
- Where are you girls headed?
- Sung San Middle School.

268
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,973
[Time to board the bus.]

269
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,600
Hello.

270
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:12,661
[This bus route seems to be
heading towards Seonyu.]

271
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,711
We just need to go two stops.

272
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,176
What were you doing?

273
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:23,363
- Were you taking our pictures?
- Were you taking pictures of us?

274
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,697
- You need to be in the picture too.
- Want to take it together?

275
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:28,155
- Let's just take it together.
- Come here.

276
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,750
Come on, let's take it together.

277
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,409
- Let me see the camera.
- I'll take the picture.

278
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,305
- Will you take the picture for us?
- What?

279
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:39,666
[Jae Suk wants the Hallyu star
to take the picture of him instead.]

280
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,459
No, not like that. But can
you take one of me with the girls?

281
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:47,156
[Hallyu star seems bewildered by the request
that Jae Suk seems to be making.]

282
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,706
One, two, three.

283
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:52,456
[With the President of
Hallyu Giraffe's fan club.]

284
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,682
- Thank you.
- You need to take a picture of me too!

285
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,639
[Refuses to take one of the Hallyu star.]

286
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,204
Don't you want to take one
with me too?

287
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,139
[No, it's okay.]

288
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,826
- Why are you so pushy?
- I'm not being pushy.

289
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,200
- They said they don't want one.
- But this is a Hallyu star race.

290
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,559
I really want you girls to cheer me on.

291
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,853
[There's your cheer.]

292
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,567
That was funny.
These girls are really funny.

293
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,373
Hey, kid.

294
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:25,252
Come sit down over here.

295
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:27,499
Come sit down over here.

296
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,208
[Is this really happening?]

297
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,480
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:36,640
He scared you, didn't he?
Come sit down over here.

299
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,770
[Yoo Hyuk steps up to rectify the situation.]

300
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,861
You're on your way to school too?
Is everyone going to school today?

301
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:45,396
- Isn't it still summer vacation?
- We have to get off the bus now.

302
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,988
[Yoo Hyuk is keeping the Giraffe
segregated until they get off the bus.]

303
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,427
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:55,912
[Goodbye, Hallyu star.]

305
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,407
The energy is so upbeat
and happy on our team.

306
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:06,488
How are your more aggressive fans?
Some of them seem like really fervent fans.

307
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,065
- Aren't they kind of cool?
- Yes, somewhat.

308
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,254
Yes, I like it when they do that.
Because I'll do the same thing to them.

309
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,950
- We're here.
- This is where we get off.

310
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,731
We're here already?

311
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,878
[In the midst of all their cheer and laughter,
they didn't even notice that they've arrived.]

312
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,310
Let's take the second exit,
and head toward the river.

313
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:31,073
What would you like Suzy?
Which one of these do you like, Suzy?

314
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:33,585
- I want this one.
- Okay.

315
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,223
- I'll pay for this.
- Suzy's paying.

316
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:39,433
- The star is buying her fans ice cream.
- Stars like you are rare.

317
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:41,741
- You are a rarity for sure.
- That's so sweet!

318
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:45,780
There should be a newspaper article about
Suzy buying her fans ice cream.

319
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,657
I'm going to upload this on SNS.

320
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:53,348
[Picture proof.]

321
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,574
I see the sign over there.
Let's take the second exit.

322
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:07,240
[Both teams arrive at Seonyudo.]

323
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:12,502
[Run to the park without wasting any time.]

324
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,070
We're the first to get here?

325
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:18,606
- Are we the first ones here?
- Hello everyone.

326
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,140
<i>Here's your first mission.</i>

327
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:23,132
<i>'I'm your paparazzi'</i>

328
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,262
<i>You've had experiences with
paparazzi as a Hallyu star, don't you?</i>

329
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:29,399
<i>From this moment on, you
yourselves will become the paparazzi.</i>

330
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,451
<i>Even though you've always had
your pictures taken</i>

331
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:34,097
<i>you will now have the chance to be
the ones to take the pictures.</i>

332
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:38,211
<i>There are several cameras
hidden throughout this park.</i>

333
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:41,410
<i>You will have to find those cameras
to become the paparazzi yourselves</i>

334
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,435
<i>and covertly take pictures of your
opposing team members.</i>

335
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:50,141
<i>The pictures have to be a full
and clear shot of their faces</i>

336
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,230
<i>and the team who successfully takes a picture
of all their opponents first wins the mission.</i>

337
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:54,405
Okay, we understand.

338
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,303
Then the other team wins the mission once
they get a picture of us two?

339
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:58,445
- Yes, that's correct.
- That's too big of an advantage for them.

340
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:01,203
- But you were the first ones to arrive.
- Maybe we can wait for them in hiding.

341
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:02,991
Okay, let's go find those cameras first.

342
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:10,169
[Photo-shoot with the Hallyu star.]

343
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,583
This place is so big.
Where are we going to find the cameras?

344
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:16,337
[It is imperative that they get
their hands on the cameras first.]

345
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:21,266
If the other team tries to get a picture,
then let's jump in each other's shots.

346
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,033
Yes, that's what we should do.
We should stick together.

347
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,172
So they can't get a shot of
our face alone.

348
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:28,002
- You know that we're at a disadvantage?
- Yes, I know.

349
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,612
This is all your fault!

350
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:32,259
This is all your fault.
I'm getting really angry all of a sudden.

351
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,295
No, it's not my fault.
We're going to win.

352
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Let's go!

353
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:40,535
[Team Suzy finally arrives at the park.]

354
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:52,310
[This fervent fan tries to do whatever he can
to stay ahead and protect his star.]

355
00:22:57,993 --> 00:22:59,561
- Jae Suk!
- I found it.

356
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:03,189
[Yoo Hyuk discovers a camera.]

357
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,524
[Hallyu Giraffe also finds a camera,
and teams up again.]

358
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:09,414
[All they have left to do now,
is plan their attack.]

359
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,842
- Let's go hide.
- How do you work this thing?

360
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:15,254
[He is so high maintenance!]

361
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,095
<i>The other team arrived just
before you did.</i>

362
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:21,800
<i>I will tell you about your mission right now.</i>

363
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:25,685
<i>Hallyu star race's first mission is,
'I'm your paparazzi.'</i>

364
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:28,585
<i>You yourselves will now
become the paparazzi.</i>

365
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:32,263
[Become the paparazzi and capture
a picture of your opposing team members.]

366
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:35,320
Kwang Soo, I think there are
two entrances to the park area.

367
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:38,310
Since we haven't seen any of them yet

368
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:40,604
there's a good chance
that they'll come through here.

369
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,688
- We should hide somewhere around here.
- That's right.

370
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:48,414
Kwang Soo.

371
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,776
[Discovers Team Suzy receiving their mission.]

372
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,000
[Erase all traces of themselves.]

373
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,128
[Places themselves in hiding.]

374
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:10,122
[Waits in hiding to capture
images of their opponents on their camera.]

375
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,196
So they're already waiting for us in hiding?

376
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,463
Do we have to do it from hiding?
Or can I look at them in the face?

377
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,519
- That is up to you.
- So we can get in their faces?

378
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,778
You can hold them down,
and we'll take the pictures.

379
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:21,636
<i>You have to find the cameras first.
You may get started.</i>

380
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:24,906
We're at an advantage here because
they won't be able to get you easily.

381
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:26,386
[Come on...]

382
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:32,454
[Plans of attack are now in place.]

383
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,198
I have to get their pictures
as they're entering the park.

384
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:42,930
[The prey enters the lion's den
while staying oblivious to their plan.]

385
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:49,891
[Preparations are now complete.]

386
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:55,224
[Let's finish this off in one shot!]

387
00:24:57,918 --> 00:25:01,153
[Paparazzi's complete camouflage.]

388
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,932
Don't look over there!

389
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,710
[Discovered right away!]

390
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,290
- He's over there.
- Don't look that way.

391
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,774
- There it is over there!
- Where?

392
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:26,363
[Fails at their initial plan, and
immediately starts chasing after them.]

393
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:31,370
[Transforms themselves into
the in your face paparazzi duo.]

394
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,325
[Capturing pictures of a moving target is
proving too difficult for these amateurs.]

395
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:40,928
Suzy!

396
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,852
Suzy!

397
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:47,332
- Suzy! I'm a huge fan of yours!
- Suzy, can I just can a picture?

398
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,492
Let us get just one picture!

399
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:52,820
- Let me just get one picture!
- Suzy!

400
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,862
Come here, Suzy!

401
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,665
- Suzy!
- No, you can't!

402
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,617
[This Hallyu star is used to
avoiding the camera lens.]

403
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,234

steps in to protect Suzy.]

404
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:15,330
[A parade of shots of Ha Ha
trying to avoid the camera lens.]

405
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,635
[Why are you taking pictures
of your own fan?]

406
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:19,512
[Pins him down to take the picture.]

407
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:27,038
[Needs a clear shot of the full face
in order for the picture to count.]

408
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,756
No!

409
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,633
[The flash keeps going off without any rest.]

410
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,522

[Ha Ha's face is captured.]

412
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:41,838
Yeah, that's enough.

413

[Just then, Kkuk comes rushing in.]

414
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,585
[Kkuk is after Kwang Soo's camera.]

415
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,322
Jae Suk!
Take the picture!

416
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:54,561
- Hurry up and take the picture!
- I'm doing it!

417
00:27:00,546 --> 00:27:04,392
[The terror of Kkuk is captured on film.]

418
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:14,929
[Hallyu Giraffe ultimately loses
his camera to Kkuk.]

419
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,332
Why would you let him take that
away from you?

420
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,370
How could you not even protect me?

421
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,804
- Huh?
- What were you doing?

422
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:25,257
Weren't you even going to protect me
while he attacked me for my camera?

423
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:28,094
Look at how scary Jong Kook looks.

424

Look at his mouth and teeth.
He's a total monster.

426
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:44,023
[Kwang Soo distracts the opponents
for Jae Suk to sneak in for a picture.]

427
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:53,375
[At this distance,
even an amateur may be able to pull it off.]

428
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:58,722
Watch out!
He's trying to take it from up above!

429
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:04,721
[Their plan is foiled by Ace Ji Hyo!]

430

431
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,990
Be careful!

434

Let's get one of them.
Come on, Gary.

435
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:23,452
Get her!
Get Blank Ji.

436
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:28,106
[Attacks Ace Ji Hyo.]

437
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,958
Ji Hyo, let me get a picture of you.

438
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:35,670
[Covers her face with her hair.]

439
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:41,104

[A face-off between the two paparazzi.]

442

[Doing everything he can to protect his
face from the camera lens.]

449
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:46,686
[Goddess of Hallyu's sole chance.]

450
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,772
Do you know where the judging table is?

451
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:00,195
- Got it.
- You got it all?

452
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:05,756
- That's good, right?
- You took 51 pictures.

453
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:11,694
You got a clear shot of Lee Kwang Soo.

454
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,876
There should be one of Jae Suk too.

455
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:18,770
[Jae Suk's picture fails since
it's not a complete shot of his full face.]

456
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:21,759
You succeeded with the shot of Lee Kwang Soo,
so you only have Jae Suk left to go.

457
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,667
You just need to get one of Jae Suk.

458
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:27,461
[Back to the scene of
Hallyu Giraffe's humiliation.]

459
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:33,066

[Kkuk heads over to the judging table.]

465
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,562
We're at too big of a disadvantage.

466
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,292
[Unable to win against
their six on two attack.]

467
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,767
- This is just absurd.
- Do you owe them anything?

468
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,328
- Why would I owe them anything?
- Maybe that's why they're after you.

469
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:29,776
This is all your fault!

470
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,566
- How is this my fault?
- This is all your fault!

471
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,764
- I got a clear shot of Kwang Soo.
- Really?

472
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,709
Take a look at the pictures.

473
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,230
It was a total war out there.

474
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:46,366
Take a look through all the pictures.

475
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,730
I took some too.

476
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,736
- Suzy already captured Kwang Soo earlier.
- Really?

477
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:58,427
So in that case...

478
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:04,357
Suzy, what are you doing?
Where's the police station around here?

479
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:08,459
We had our camera stolen,
and... come here, Kwang Soo.

480
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,752
[The biggest victim of the mission.]

481
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,223
- This is my camera.
- He had his camera stolen away from him.

482
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:21,886
This team is full of delinquents
with two girls and four boys.

483
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:25,167
- They all attacked us.
- That's too bad.

484
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:27,828
They pushed down on our pressure points.

485
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,822
Don't you think that's going overboard?

486
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,737
[Suzy busies herself by taking
pictures of their angry disposition.]

487
00:32:32,738 --> 00:32:36,243
[Project title-
'This is unfair' by Suzy.]

488
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:39,140
[Judging of Kkuk's pictures.]

489
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,878
This one?
Let me reenact it for you.

490
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,160
[An immediate reenactment.]

491
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,126
I was right.

492
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:50,759
- Is this what you're referring to?
- This is the perfect reenactment.

493
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,788
- Is this the shot?
- Yes, this is the shot.

494
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,030
This is really hurtful to my pride.

495
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:03,922
- Suzy got the shot of Kwang Soo's face.
- When did Suzy take the picture?

496
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:08,485
And Kim Jong Kook captured a successful
shot of Kim Jong Kook's face.

497
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,379
Team Suzy wins this mission.

498
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,529
[Team Suzy wins!]

499
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,828
- How could you all have gone to the Rabbit?
- Then why would you go to Giraffe?

500
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,439
Had I known that Suzy was the Rabbit,
then I totally would've gone there too!

501
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:25,699
This Hallyu star doesn't even have any money.
He wouldn't even buy me anything to eat!

502
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,941
- Why are you bringing that up?
- The fan should be taking care of the star!

503
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:33,068
I have a feeling that you'll
soon be joining our team.

504
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:38,411
[First candidate to be kicked off the team?]

505
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:40,117
You may be going back
and forth between the teams.

506
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,668
I do feel a bit nervous about that,
but I've been really nice to Suzy all day.

507
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:52,147
As mentioned earlier, Suzy now has
a team member chance card.

508
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:55,260
[A chance to swap out a member
should she choose to do so.]

509
00:33:55,261 --> 00:33:58,506
I ran in and saved you
from a dangerous situation.

510
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:03,268
You can either bring someone in,
or send someone out of your team.

511
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:08,956
- What happens if I bring someone in?
- If I go, then he loses his Hallyu stardom.

512
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:11,656
Suzy would never be that cruel.

513
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:15,498
[What do I do about this situation?]

514
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:18,322
I'll give you some time
to think about it.

515
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:22,966
- I've always admired you from afar.
- I've always loved and supported you.

516
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:27,969
- I think...
- State your decision on the count of three.

517
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:32,271
- I'll send someone out.
- You're sending someone out?

518
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:37,694
- Just tell me who you're going to send out.
- It could be you that she sends out.

519
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:39,806
[You could be the one.]

520
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:42,572
Suzy's already turning her back on you.

521
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:45,909
- Suzy keeps turning her back on you.
- What are you talking about?

522
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,914
It's going to be one of you two!

523
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:51,338
I bet my whole fortune
that she picks Suk Jin.

524
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,793
You just have to say who it is,
and that person will leave your team.

525
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:57,162
[Time to reveal her decision.]

526
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,356
- I don't think it's going to be me.
- Okay, I understand.

527
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,496
Thank you, Suzy Bae.

528
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,004
[Suzy steps away from the situation.]

529
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,054
Suzy, we'll be able to look at each other
with smiles on our faces again, right?

530
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,700
- We can do that, right?
- Sure!

531
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,733
I've never been wrong about
these kinds of premonitions before.

532
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,858
I'll whisper it in your ear,
so just step away from the team, okay?

533
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,915
- Step out where?
- Just over there.

534
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,317
So the last person to stand remaining
will be joining our team.

535
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:27,451
[The last person remaining
will be the one to get kicked out.]

536
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:29,375
He's already the president of my fan club,
so the new person will be the VP.

537
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:33,559
I'm the president of his fan club.

538
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:37,179
[Gets the uniform ready for the new member.]

539
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,666
I would sincerely like to thank everyone
for coming here today

540
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:47,083
to welcome a new member to
Hallyu Giraffe's Fan Club.

541
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:50,642
One of you five members will
soon be joining our team.

542
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:55,530
So the new member to join our team
will have to pay a small joining fee.

543
00:35:55,531 --> 00:36:00,380
That's because we're a new fan club too.
Song Ji Hyo, go join Suzy over there.

544
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:02,739
- Thank you.
- It's disappointing, but we'll see you again.

545
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,191
Hallyu Rabbit is the best!

546
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,125
Suzy, I'll see you soon!

547
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:09,685
Hallyu Rabbit is the best!

548
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:17,251
- Ha Ha, you may also step aside.
- Thank you.

549
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:19,731
- What the heck?
- I have a feeling he'll be joining us later.

550
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,333
Out of my way!
Rabbit!

551
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,470
- Ji Suk Jin?
- Yes?

552
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,372
Can you step aside a little?

553
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,337
Are you playing with me right now?

554
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:42,089
- Don't play with me!
- You're just moving aside, that's all.

555
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,105
[Extremely sensitive at even
having to move over to the side.]

556
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,809
Next up is, Gary.
You may go join your team members.

557
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,304
Now it's between you two.

558
00:36:56,305 --> 00:37:02,857
We will now make the final announcement
and welcome a new member to our team.

559
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:06,739
This is a pretty big shirt,
so even Kim Jong Kook could fit into it.

560
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,249
I don't know why Suzy chose
the person she did.

561
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:14,211
- Ji Suk Jin?
- Yes?

562
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,990
Can you move back over here?

563
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:23,843
Why do you keep making me go
back and forth like that?

564
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:26,069
Just make it quick!

565
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:35,316
Once we announce the decision that
Bae Suzy has made between these two

566
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:39,601
this new member of our team will be
honored with an official spot on our team.

567
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:41,695
Yes, this person will be
honored with the VP position.

568
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,697
- 30,000 won is the joining fee.
- Yes, that's correct.

569
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,995
- The fee has to be paid right away.
- Do we get something for the fee?

570
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,988
- No, that will pay for our meal.
- You'll get this shirt for it.

571
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,113
That'll be the cost
for the shirt and the meal.

572
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:56,845
- I thought there would be something else.
- We're not really set up for that yet.

573
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:59,751
[All they have to offer in this fan club
is the mutual love for their star, Giraffe.]

574
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,272
Then I will now make the announcement.

575
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:07,201
- Ji Suk Jin, can you please say a word?
- I don't believe that Suzy will betray me.

576
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:12,483
- Yes, I have always been a fan of hers.
- How about you recite a poem with her name?

577
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:14,779
- Su.
- Suzy, I love you.

578
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,510
- Zy.
- Ji Suk Jin loves you.

579
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:21,731
- Wow, that's very touching.
- I don't regret my decision.

580
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,863
Okay, Kim Jong Kook.
Your turn with the poem.

581
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,654
- Su.
- Suzy is...

582
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,540
- Zy.
- Is the prettiest girl on this earth.

583
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:33,207
Okay, Kim Jong Kook...

584
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,374
[Will he leave... or stay?]

585
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,803
Okay, Kim Jong Kook...

586
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,664
Please go join your teammates.

587
00:38:44,665 --> 00:38:47,131
[Kim Jong Kook remains on Team Suzy.]

588
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:50,661
[Ji Suk Jin is kicked out.]

589
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:59,434
<i>Congratulations...</i>

590
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:05,072
<i>We congratulate you on
getting kicked off the team.</i>

591
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:15,893
Now that you've become a member of our team,
let's take a picture to commemorate this.

592
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:21,249
[A picture to commemorate having become
the VP of Giraffe's fan club.]

593
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,853
Give me a piggy back ride.

594
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:26,843
I said, piggy back ride. This should
be a perk for being on your team.

595
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,472
Had I known that Suzy was the Rabbit,
then I would've joined her team.

596
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:35,427
[Paparazzi mission- Team Suzy wins.]

597
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:43,570
If we win the next mission,
we're going to send him back to you.

598
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,561
You should just carry both the shirts
around with you all day.

599
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:51,715
You just wait and see. I'm going
to make you regret your decision.

600
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,135
You just wait yourself.

601
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:57,008
- Should we get going?
- Let's go.

602
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:59,177
I took the subway train earlier.

603
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,976
- We have to get there before them.
- Yes, of course.

604
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:05,470
What are the benefits of being on this team?
Suzy bought us all ice cream.

605
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:09,261
- He won't even buy us food.
- Come on.

606
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:11,902
Buy us a bowl of soup or something.

607

[Team Suzy- Bus vs Team Giraffe- Subway.]

608
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,427
I haven't taken the bus in so long.

609
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:21,055
- Is this the bus stop?
- Come stand over here in the shade.

610
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:23,523
- Stand over there.
- Come stand over here too.

611
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:27,237
This is a direct route to where
we need to go.

612
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,760
- They'll all take us there.
- We can take this one, or that one.

613
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:34,573
The bus is here.

614
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:39,750
- Can we pay with a card?
- You don't need that cash.

615
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:43,144
- Don't you even know that?
- Didn't you take the bus to school?

616
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:45,962
- No, I didn't.
- Don't you have a card?

617
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:53,731
The innocence about you makes me
want to protect you even more.

- No, it's okay. We'll be getting off soon.

so much about Kwang Soo?

647
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:49,868
You have to spin the hula hoops
while hanging off the bar behind you.

648
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:54,847
[Rule- Spin the hula hoop while
hanging off the bar.]

649
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:59,522
This is a loyalty game.
You must do a total of 60 seconds or more.

650
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:04,630
[Since it's a healthy club,
Mr. Muscle Head will start them off first.]

651
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:08,142
[The clock will start once they
get on the bar first.]

652
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:13,352
Kwang Soo's record was four seconds.

653
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:16,072
You're doing it!

654
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:20,251
[With this being Kkuk's background,
he already shows a strong knack for it.]

655
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,741
You got this.
You did ten seconds.

656
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,225
But I have a feeling that I looked
awful while doing it.

657
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,034
[Team Giraffe arrives.]

658
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:44,615
- I think we need him off our team.
- These guys are depressing.

659
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,349
No one even recognizes me.

660
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:51,771
All anyone even cares about is Jae Suk.

661
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:56,185
- I don't know why this fan club even exists.
- Excuse me, VP Ji.

662
00:43:56,186 --> 00:43:58,531
Please stop insulting our fan club.

663
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:02,163
I'm trying my best here.
So what's this all about?

664
00:44:02,164 --> 00:44:06,059
For this mission, we have to spin
the hula hoops while hanging off this bar.

665
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,621
I can't do the hula hoop even
while standing flat on my feet.

666
00:44:08,622 --> 00:44:11,298
I can get maybe three at best.

667
00:44:12,223 --> 00:44:15,073
If we win this mission,
I can kick Suk Jin off my team, right?

668
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:20,031
Seriously, I already told you earlier,
but he'll be bouncing back and forth.

669
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:24,755
[Team Suzy's first official turn.]

670
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:27,534
- Take your time.
- He's actually quite good.

671
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:29,826
There you go!

672
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:32,807
- He's actually quite good.
- There you go!

673
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:38,861
- He's such a beast!
- This is what we have to do?

674
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:41,315
[Kkuk is working out his whole body.]

675
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,637
- I feel really weird doing it.
- You're a total monster.

676
00:44:48,638 --> 00:44:51,067
- I really can't stand even looking at you.
- You really are like a beast.

677
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:55,811
[Immediately launches into an attack mode
on their opposing team.]

678
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,009
- Your record is 13.5 seconds.
- Is this actually even feasible?

679
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:04,001
- Suzy's really good.
- Hold onto the bar.

680
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,086
Lower your body as if
you're hanging off of it.

681
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:11,665
- There you go!
- She's doing really well.

682
00:45:13,772 --> 00:45:16,827
- Not bad at all.
- Even Suzy looks awful while doing it.

683
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:19,506
Even Suzy looks awful while doing it.

684
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:23,394
What did you just say?

685
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:32,098
Aren't you in my fan club?
Aren't you going to stand up for me?

686
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,727
Even though we're in your fan club,
we have our own lives to protect too.

687
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:37,901
Even though we exist as your fans
because we have you

688
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,144
we still have our own lives to live too.

689
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:47,920
[Team Suzy- 43.5 seconds left to go.]

690
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:50,850
There you go, Ha Ha!

691
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:55,056
[Abilities that they've never shown before
emerge in front of their star.]

692
00:45:57,237 --> 00:46:00,027
[Kiddo fan's record- Eight seconds.]

693
00:46:00,028 --> 00:46:03,268
Can you play me some music?
I seriously think that'll help me do better.

694
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:10,232
This is like club music.

695
00:46:14,056 --> 00:46:16,527
[Transformed into Rhythm Gary.]

696
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:27,055
[Gary's record- Four seconds.]

697
00:46:27,056 --> 00:46:30,447
- I think the music will help me.
- Ji Hyo, are you good at this?

698
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:33,507
I don't know why,
but I feel like I'm still on their team.

699
00:46:34,534 --> 00:46:37,079
It makes me feel good when
I see you guys doing well.

700
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,797
- Ji Hyo's good.
- Wow, she's good.

701
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:47,857
[Ace takes her time and
is showing some staying power.]

702
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,997
[Ace's record- Eight seconds.]

703
00:46:57,561 --> 00:47:00,485
- You guys are really good.
- So who wants to go first?

704
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,587
Want to give it a try?

705
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:04,576
[Team Giraffe's turn.]

706
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:08,442
- Spin this for me.
- Even though you may be older than me...

707
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:11,133
- You still need to speak in honorifics to me.
- You're the newbie in our club.

708
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:17,947
Spin it to the left like this.

709
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,271
- Like this?
- Yes, like that.

710
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,763
- Ready, set...
- Spin it.

711
00:47:22,764 --> 00:47:26,295
Come on, can't you do it right?

712
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:29,277
- We'll do it again.
- I'm trying to be as patient as I can.

713
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:31,053
[Star himself steps up to help.]

714
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:34,283
I told you to spin it the other way.

715
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,845
[Seemed to be relieved that he's no longer
a part of their team.]

716
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,505
To the left!

717
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:43,417
[Big-nose is proving to be tough to please.]

718
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:52,525
[Mr. Bounce in the house.]

719
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,537
[Record- Six seconds.
Not too shabby for this VP.]

720
00:47:59,347 --> 00:48:01,409
He's better than I thought he'd be.

721
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,325
That's good.

722
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:07,025
There you go.

723
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:10,535
[Our Kwang Soo doesn't even have to jump
for him to become one with the bar.]

724
00:48:10,536 --> 00:48:13,616
[But his feet need to be off the ground
for the clock to start.]

725
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:16,292
[He needs to get his feet off the ground.]

726
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,168
It's time.

727
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,688
[A very determined look on his face.]

728
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:27,814
[One more foot!]

729
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:34,890
[He's got the feel for it now!]

730
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:40,574
You're doing good!

731
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,164
[Fan club cheer.]

732
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:57,170
[Hallyu Giraffe- A whopping 21 seconds!]

733
00:48:57,171 --> 00:49:00,192
- That was good.
- I couldn't have done it without you two.

734
00:49:00,193 --> 00:49:03,560
- I think I got the feel for it now.
- I think we can do this.

735
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:05,932
What were you staring at
when you were up there?

736
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:08,500
Why do you even care what
my star was staring at?

737
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:11,416
- It's because I found him pitiful.
- You are unbelievable.

738
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,728
We're bringing you onto our team
if we win this mission.

739
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:16,582
And we're going to make you
do all our errands.

740
00:49:19,178 --> 00:49:21,524
- That's a frightening thought.
- Scary, isn't it?

741
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,840
We're going to bring you on,
and make you our errand boy.

742
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:26,595
We're going to make you do all our errands.

743
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:31,406
One, two, three.

744
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,852
- What are you doing!
- I'm sorry, President Yoo.

745
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:48,224
[A special training tactic
just for his President Yoo.]

746
00:49:48,225 --> 00:49:50,680
What were you doing!

747
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:56,172
You can only exist because of fans like me.

748
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:58,062
This is no way to treat your fans.

749
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,618
Ugh, seriously.

750
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,212
- Spin it with your waist.
- Why are you moving your whole body?

751
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:05,129
- Spin it to the left.
- There you go!

752
00:50:06,322 --> 00:50:08,214
There you go!

753
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,785
[All thanks to the help of his star.]

754
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:26,172
[President Grasshopper is ready to take flight.]

755
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:29,670
Don't make me laugh.

756
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:38,465
[A surprisingly unexpected performance
by President Yoo.]

757
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:41,082
- I was totally shocked.
- 22 seconds.

758
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:46,266
- I was totally shocked.
- You just need to get the feel for it.

759
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,470
Don't make me laugh.
That's why I failed.

760
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,390
[Team Giraffe unfortunately fails
with a record of 49 seconds.]

761
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:54,041
- We were just cheering you on.
- I was completely shocked.

762
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:57,061
- You were shocked, weren't you?
- Yes, I was very shocked.

763
00:50:57,062 --> 00:50:59,085
Yes, this will surprise you for sure.

764
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:03,466
[Team Suzy- Ji Hyo to lead them off.]

765
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,624
You look very natural doing that.

766
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:12,028
[Not so natural looking anymore.]

767
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,154
[But our Ace doesn't disappoint!]

768
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:25,788
- You're not called an 'Ace' for nothing.
- Yes, you're very good.

769
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:28,395
[Record of seven seconds.
That's our Ace!]

770
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,899
[Captain Kkuk to spin the hoop for Ha Ha.]

771
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,770
No, lift up your knees.
Your knees!

772
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:43,602
[This fan club gets you in trouble
if lacking in physical stamina.]

773
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:45,709
[I'll just have to do better.]

774
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,602
How does she look so natural
doing that?

775
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:01,535
[Even escapes the moment of danger
by making it look like she's dancing.]

776
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,542
- Remember the bar dance she did?
- Of course, I do.

777
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:11,529
[This Hallyu star makes even
the bar exercise look lovely.]

778
00:52:15,952 --> 00:52:19,274
[Oh, my goddess.]

779
00:52:21,512 --> 00:52:24,657
- Remember the bar dance she did?
- Of course, I do.

780
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,768
[Suzy's record- Two seconds.]

781
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:30,934
You did great!

782
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,607
[We'll just make up for your slack.]

783
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:41,161
You keep your arms straight
when you hang off the bar, don't you?

784
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:45,034
You want to give
Suzy some pointers, don't you?

785
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:48,539
No, it's not that.

786
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,514
- She's still our star.
- You want to say something to her.

787
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:53,454
Want to spin it after getting on the bar?

788
00:52:53,455 --> 00:52:55,218
- Want me to spin it for you?
- No, that's okay.

789
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,771
[Spins the hoop on his own.]

790
00:53:00,283 --> 00:53:02,580
- I'll spin it for you.
- No, let me start over.

791
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:08,604
- Get on the bar, and I'll spin it.
- No, I think my way is better.

792
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,320
Listen to us for once.

793
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:17,705
[Buried resentment from
the other members of the fan club.]

794
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:20,444
It took him four years to say that.

795
00:53:20,445 --> 00:53:24,170
[It took him four years to say that, Suzy.]

796
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,353
We've all been wanting to
say that to him for four years.

797
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:28,631
Too bad I couldn't get it earlier.

798
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,970
[Resurrection of King Kong!]

799
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:35,718
There you go!

800
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:46,269
He seriously is a total monster.

801
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:52,155
[A true king of fitness.]

802
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:56,117
[30 seconds and counting.]

803
00:53:57,232 --> 00:54:00,336
[Hula hoop monster.]

804
00:54:02,432 --> 00:54:06,114
[Record of 38 seconds. Team Suzy
unfortunately fails with 58 seconds]

805
00:54:07,588 --> 00:54:09,731
Wow, you guys are something else.

806
00:54:09,732 --> 00:54:11,652
- Can you help me spin this?
- Okay.

807
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,260
- This is much better.
- Here we go.

808
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:16,817
One, two, three.

809
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,345
Concentrate.

810
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,722
[His hips have gotten the feel
for the moves.]

811
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:28,259
Concentrate.

812
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:36,880
[The Grasshopper has still got it.]

813
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:45,180
[Yoo Hyuk's record- 25 seconds.]

814
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,007
You do 30 seconds, and I'll do five.

815
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,653
Just do all 35 seconds yourself.

816
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:54,341
[Giraffe's turn.]

817
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:57,549
There you go.

818
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:10,038
[His physical awareness that he's
showing off to his fans.]

819
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:14,064
[Way to go, Hallyu Giraffe.]

820
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:17,911
[A stressed out expression on his face.]

821
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:26,183
[The love from my fans
is what keeps me going!]

822
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,708
- 33 seconds.
- Then how many more seconds do we need?

823
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:32,786
[Hallyu Giraffe- 33 seconds.
Only two more seconds are needed to win!]

824
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,626
What if I can't even get two seconds?

825
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:38,036
[Then you'll definitely
get kicked off the team.]

826
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:40,333
You know how long two seconds
can be, right?

827
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:43,223
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
About that long.

828
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:46,086
Didn't you see how long two seconds
can be at the London Olympics?

829
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:49,210
Please let me last for two seconds.

830
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,854
[His fate rests on those two seconds.]

831
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:53,744
If you can get this, then you win.

832
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:57,574
- Just spin it.
- You could just end this right now.

833
00:55:57,575 --> 00:56:03,361
[Two seconds could mean failure
when it comes to Big-nose.]

834
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:14,866
[The victorious pelvic thrusts!]

835
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:19,474
[Team Giraffe wins
with a record of 63 seconds!]

836
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,159
- We can kick Ji Suk Jin off our team!
- We did it!

837
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,376
- We can get Ji Suk Jin off our team!
- You're going to kick me off the team?

838
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:31,000
- You can go back to the team.
- No, you did great.

839
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:35,458
- Okay, I think we did great together.
- I think we've found the rhythm.

840
00:56:36,882 --> 00:56:39,895
[Team Giraffe now has the chance
to utilize their chance card.]

841
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,984
Who can either bring someone on
from your opposing team

842
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,841
or you can kick someone out,
or keep your team as is.

843
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:46,661
When I think of an errand boy,
that's definitely Ha Ha.

844
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,813
But when I think about winning,
then it's Jong kook.

845
00:56:48,814 --> 00:56:53,511
But if Jong Kook comes...
then we're all dead.

846
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:56,979
Because we won't have any say in anything
and we'll just have to do what he says.

847
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,050
[No fan club to speak of anymore.]

848
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:03,257
It would be best if we could bring Suzy.

849
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:08,590
- Just take me.
- One, two, three.

850
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,208
[Decision time.]

851
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:13,800
[Sounds like it'll be either
Ha Ha or Jong Kook...]

852
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:18,451
You, come here, Ha Ha.

853
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:21,225
[Team Giraffe's chance card-
Brings Ha Ha on board.]

854
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:23,195
- Suzy!
- Come here.

855
00:57:23,196 --> 00:57:27,247
- What are you going to do without me?
- What are you going to do with us?

856
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:30,981
[Why don't you just worry about yourself?]

857
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:34,597
You guys must've lost your minds!
Get your hands off of me.

858
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:36,861
[Forcefully welcoming him onto the team.]

859
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:38,802
- I'll do it myself.
- Just take it off.

860
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,749
Can't you at least
act like you're disappointed?

861
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:47,501
Suzy did the whole crying bit
without a bit of emotion behind it.

862
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:52,934
[Seconds mission- Star's physical fitness.
Team Giraffe wins.]

863
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,600
- Hey, newbie.
- Yes?

864
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:04,058
[Destination- SBS.
Team Giraffe to take the taxi.]

865
00:58:06,323 --> 00:58:10,967
If all four of us are to get in the cab, then
you have to sit up front with the camera.

866
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:13,454
- I have to do what?
- You have to film us.

867
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:22,772
[Team Suzy- Bus.
Team Giraffe- Taxi.]

868
00:58:27,956 --> 00:58:30,455
We're here.
You can let us out here.

869
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:32,950
Thank you, have a good day.

870
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,624
[Team Giraffe are the first ones to arrive.]

871
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,252
Thank you.

872
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:43,197
- SBS! My place of work.
- There it is.

873
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,006
- I bet they're already here.
- Since they took a cab...

874
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:49,921
I bet it took them no time to get here.

875
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:53,921
- Come on, hurry.
- I think I see something.

876
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:57,429
[The sooner you arrive,
more advantageous it'll be for the team.]

877
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,874
<i>You have the advantage for arriving first.
Here's your mission.</i>

878
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:03,592
<i>This is an event that all stars get to
experience from Hollywood to here.</i>

879
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:07,297
<i>It's the handprint event
that you see behind you.</i>

880
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:13,742
<i>We have hidden several hand printing
boxes throughout the SBS building.</i>

881
00:59:14,296 --> 00:59:17,443
<i>As you can see here with my handprint,
you can get an impression of your own hand.</i>

882
00:59:17,444 --> 00:59:23,957
<i>You have to bring the box back to this
hand printing zone and make an impression.</i>

883
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:26,337
- All four members of the team have to do it.
- All four of us?

884
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:29,776
- Then we need to find four?
- Yes, that's correct. You may get started.

885
00:59:29,777 --> 00:59:31,914
- Where are they going?
- What is this?

886
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,403
- We have to take this?
- Here are your rules.

887
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,972
<i>We have hidden several hand printing
boxes throughout the SBS building.</i>

888
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,369
We can't do the hand printing in advance.

889
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,142
- We have to come back here and do it.
- Come back to the zone.

890
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:45,326
- There are four men on our team.
- You're right.

891
00:59:45,984 --> 00:59:49,245
- Don't worry.
- You may now get started.

892
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:51,942
- Let's get going.
- Will our names be on the ground too then?

893
00:59:51,943 --> 00:59:54,124
- You think?
- That would be nice to see my name.

894
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,800
- That's not going to happen.
- No, it's not.

895
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,649
No, that's not going to happen.

896
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,222
There it is.

897
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,632
We should've taken the next one.

898
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:07,732
- I'm sorry about that.
- We wanted to ride with Suzy.

899
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:12,446
- We feel the same way.
- We want to be with her too.

900
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:15,127
But we're all Lee Kwang Soo's fans.

901
01:00:15,128 --> 01:00:17,631
- Let's get off here.
- Let's get off on the third floor.

902
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:21,959
- Want to check out the sixth floor?
- Let's pair off in two's.

903
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,229
- Be careful not to get it taken from you.
- Get what taken?

904
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:29,304
- This?
- No, the hand printing box.

905
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:32,490
- You don't get it on the first try, do you?
- She's not good at understanding things.

906
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:37,627
I don't know if she has bad hearing.

907
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:40,283
She has slightly bad hearing.

908
01:00:41,063 --> 01:00:43,423
My father has bad hearing too.

909
01:00:44,604 --> 01:00:48,357
[Team Giraffe is busy looking
for the hand printing boxes.]

910
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:52,050
Wow, the search is on again.

911
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:54,835
I think it's going to be on the second floor.

912
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:56,439
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

913
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,367
Let's search through this whole place.

914
01:01:06,065 --> 01:01:07,277
I found one!

915
01:01:07,278 --> 01:01:11,744
[The prince of Asia!
Hallyu Giraffe finds the very first box.]

916
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:14,545
Once you find the box, you
have to go back to where we started.

917
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:18,971
[Must go back to the hand printing zone
to make an impression of their hand.]

918
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:23,668
- I saw Jae Suk earlier.
- There they are. They're over there.

919
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:26,505
[Suspicious to anyone looking.]

920
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:30,821
- Let's get off here.
- I'm going to go up to the sixth floor.

921
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:32,931
[Jong Kook and Gary gets off to
get their hand on Giraffe's box.]

922

Here they come.

923
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:39,160
[Target in sight.]

924
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:42,503
Take the stairs and go back to the zone.

925
01:01:47,597 --> 01:01:51,797
[Let's act natural... act natural.]

926
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:53,483
He's going out the door.
Come on, Gary!

927
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:57,673
[But you can't fool the Tiger!]

928
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,723
[Hallyu Giraffe is captured!]

929
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,935
Kwang Soo!
That fool!

930
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:13,435
- That Lee Kwang Soo.
- Where did you come from!

931
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:17,819
[Anti- fan.
Steals the box from the Hallyu star.]

932
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,879
- I'll do it first.
- Okay, go ahead.

933
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,557
- I'll be back again.
- Where did you two come from!

934
01:02:23,891 --> 01:02:28,755
[Team Suzy-
Muscle fan succeeds his mission.]

935
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,664
- Pass. You may now take a seat.
- I can't go back there?

936
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,067
No, take a rest.

937
01:02:33,844 --> 01:02:39,243
[Rule- Once you succeed your portion,
then you can't go back into the building.]

[Kwang Soo re-enters the building
to find another box.]

939

[Even he himself can't believe his luck!]

941
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:04,297
Wow, how did this even happen?

942
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,037
[I vow to succeed this time.]

943
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:12,271
[Step one- carefully monitor the area.]

944

[Step 2- And go straight out the door.]

945
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:22,772
[But...]

946
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:26,913
[His unlucky streak
doesn't seem to be ending...]

947

[Purposely calling out Gary's name
towards the building for distraction.]

948
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:33,038
Why are you doing this!

949

[Hallyu Giraffe gets his box stolen
for the second time.]

950
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:43,537
- Do I have to do this now?
- What else can you do? Just do it.

951
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:46,701
[Leaves them worrying for
their remaining female members.]

952
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:49,523
[Team Suzy- Gary succeeds with imprinting.]

953

[Unbelievable...]

954
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:55,309
- Where do you keep finding these?
- Did you find one?

955
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,587
I found two,
and they stole both of them away from me.

956
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:00,157
What are we going to do about the girls?

957
01:04:01,514 --> 01:04:04,071
I didn't even see you guys around.

958
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:09,883
[Oh?
The box was hidden behind his back!]

959
01:04:09,884 --> 01:04:12,097
So I should just hide it in the back?

960
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:16,020
- How did you know that?
- It was obvious.

961
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:19,811
[Ha Ha is the first to succeed
for Team Giraffe.]

962
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,208
So Ji Hyo and Suzy are the only
ones left now?

963
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:27,056
[Hallyu Giraffe heads back
inside the building.]

964
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:29,091
Hello.

965
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:34,439
- You're so pretty.
- Thank you.

966
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,753
[It's a fan meeting no matter where she goes.]

967
01:04:40,772 --> 01:04:43,457
I'm really bad at finding things.

968
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,822
[Suzy's especially bad when it comes
to finding things.]

969

[Searching through every nook
and cranny of the editing room.]

970

Isn't that Kwang Soo?

971
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,387
That looks like Kwang Soo.

972
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:07,027
Awesome!

973
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,703
[Discovers a box in the editing room!]

974
01:05:12,172 --> 01:05:14,042
I feel like I should hide this.

975
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:22,299
The boxes aren't going to be easy to find.

976
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,281
There's Suzy.

977
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:26,459
There she is over there.
Which floor is she on?

978
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,399
[Big-nose discovers Suzy holding the box.]

979
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,969
So I pass once I go back
and make an impression?

980
01:05:34,273 --> 01:05:37,441
Was it the fifth floor?
This is the floor.

981
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,594
There she is.

982
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:49,356
[The attack of Big-nose hyena.]

983
01:05:49,357 --> 01:05:52,477
[Once a fan now attacks.]

984
01:05:52,478 --> 01:05:54,543
- Let's carry it together
- This box?

985
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:56,845
- Just show me what it looks like?
- This?

986
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:01,161
- I'm not going to steal it away from you.
- You stole my pillow the last time.

987
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:05,541
[Suzy escapes away from Big-nose's grasp.]

988
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:07,299
Suzy, I'm a huge fan of yours.

989
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,866
Suzy, I really am a fan of yours.
Just tell me where you found it.

990
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:14,294
Let's play for it.

991
01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:16,381
[Shamelessly asks her to play for it.]

992
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:19,177
- Why would I have to do that?
- I can't fight you for it.

993
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:22,171
[Just then, Blank Ji runs in to her rescue.]

994
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:24,201
- Get out of here, Suzy!
- Suzy!

995
01:06:24,202 --> 01:06:26,669
- Get out of here, Suzy!
- Bring that back!

996
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:30,209
- Hey, Suzy!
- Suzy.

997
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:33,420
[But she's blocked off by Jae Suk.]

998
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:35,497
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm sorry, Suzy.

999
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:37,601
Suzy.

1000
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:41,319
[Blank Ji reappears to her rescue.]

1001
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,069
- I have to protect Suzy.
- I need to take that from you.

1002
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:48,210
[Blank Ji appears out of thin air
whenever her star is in need of rescuing.]

1003
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:50,912
Let's put the box down and play for it.

1004
01:06:50,913 --> 01:06:53,474
- Put it down?
- Yeah, put it down and play for it.

1005
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,356
[Just as expected.
Big-nose sneaks a steal!]

1006
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,104
Run!

1007
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:14,543
Move!

1008
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:19,827
[Jae Suk isn't letting up
on his grip on Blank Ji.]

1009
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:24,277
[Big-nose takes the chance
and makes his escape.]

1010
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:27,559
[Suzy stays hot on his trail.]

1011
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,122
Suzy!

1012
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,519
Hurry up and run!

1013
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:37,502
[Star chaser for the hand printing box.]

1014
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:39,717
- I need to win this mission.
- Suzy.

1015
01:07:41,036 --> 01:07:44,295
I had a feeling I found that box too easily.

1016
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:46,586
I'm going to get you back for this!

1017
01:07:48,694 --> 01:07:51,737
Kim Jong Kook!
Kang Gary!

1018
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,639
Kim Jong Kook!

1019
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,514
- Kang Gary!
- That Blank Ji Hyo!

1020
01:07:56,515 --> 01:08:00,404
- Kim Jong Kook! Get Ji Suk Jin!
- Be quiet!

1021
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:03,249
[But Kim Jong Kook and Kang Gary
are already outside...]

1022
01:08:04,302 --> 01:08:08,538
[Thanks to that, Big-nose safely
arrives at the hand printing zone.]

1023
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:10,971
- Suzy hasn't found one yet, has she?
- She did and I stole it away from her.

1024
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:12,969
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1025
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,002
[Angry Suzy's fan club.]

1026
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,889
[Big-nose succeeds
his portion of the mission.]

1027
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,378
I was acting very casual about it.

1028
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:26,793
[Hallyu Giraffe is on the search
for his third box.]

1029
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:29,182
I've used up all of my luck
for this next year.

1030
01:08:32,084 --> 01:08:36,039
[Carefully opens up the door...]

1031
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:43,794
[Oh? Another box!]

1032
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:48,522
[Now two years of luck have been used.
Boxes are just rolling in for the Giraffe.]

1033
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:54,668
[I will not have this
stolen away from me again!]

1034
01:08:54,669 --> 01:08:57,932
[Carefully hides away the box.]

1035
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:05,185
[Blank Ji is seen heading this way.]

1036
01:09:13,027 --> 01:09:16,343
[She fortunately doesn't seem to notice.]

1037
01:09:17,907 --> 01:09:21,996
[How can you not notice with
the look he has on his face?]

1038
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:26,417
You haven't found one?
You really haven't found one?

1039
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:29,237
[No one's going to believe that!]

1040
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:31,210
- Come on, let's get out of here first.
- Just hear me out.

1041
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:33,820
[Agrees to step out of the room first.]

1042
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:36,990
I'm starting to get really pissed.

1043
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:38,642
This will be the third time
it's stolen away from me.

1044
01:09:38,643 --> 01:09:41,597
Come on, Kwang Soo.
Let me just take it.

1045
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,155
No, hear me out.

1046
01:09:43,156 --> 01:09:47,790
Jong Kook and Gary waited for me outside,
and took the first two boxes away from me.

1047
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,686
- That's really not nice of them.
- That's what I'm saying.

1048
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,633
- That's not very nice of them.
- Let me just go.

1049
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:55,528
But that was Jong Kook and Gary,
I had nothing to do with it.

1050
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:58,449
- Just hear me out.
- Just give it to me.

1051
01:09:58,863 --> 01:10:00,210
But...

1052
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:01,849
[Will Kwang-Star be able to
leave his own handprint?]

1053
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:07,230
[Suzy goes back on the search after
having her first box stolen by Big-nose.]

1054
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:14,567
[Discovers a box in the studio!]

1055
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:23,357
[Kwang-Star's number one fan
discovers a box of his own!]

1056
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:30,463
[Suzy's on the move!]

1057
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,455
- It's Suzy.
- Suzy!

1058
01:10:32,456 --> 01:10:33,928
Be careful and hurry!

1059
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:39,035
- Okay, we're all good.
- What about Ji Hyo?

1060
01:10:39,036 --> 01:10:42,981
[Suzy also successfully imprints her hand.]

1061
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:45,395
Did Jae Suk pass too?
There's Jae Suk over there.

1062
01:10:45,396 --> 01:10:48,527
[Kwang Soo and Blank Ji are still
fighting over the box.]

1063
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:50,168
Jae Suk!

1064
01:10:50,169 --> 01:10:52,493
- I hope that I'm not too late.
- Jae Suk!

1065
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,682
Jae Suk!

1066
01:10:55,683 --> 01:10:58,135
[Kwang-Star desperately shouts out for help.]

1067
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:00,966
Yoo Jae Suk!
Jae Suk!

1068
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:02,711
[Please!]

1069
01:11:06,603 --> 01:11:08,429
Jae Suk!

1070
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:12,614
[Pretends not to hear?
Runs out of the building.]

1071
01:11:13,615 --> 01:11:15,564
Why is he running away?

1072
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:18,289
Jae Suk!

1073
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:23,074
[Sorry, but I'll be going first.]

1074
01:11:24,552 --> 01:11:27,668
[Kwang-Star is abandoned.]

1075
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:29,600
You can't bite me!

1076
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:32,086
[Kwang-Star bites down hard.]

1077
01:11:33,105 --> 01:11:35,802
[Bites down on each other.]

1078
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:38,100
[Tooth for a tooth!]

1079
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:41,662
I can't believe you bit me!

1080
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:44,528
Jae Suk!

1081
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,969
- Jae Suk!
- Who's that?

1082
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,934
[President Yoo makes it over
after abandoning his star.]

1083
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,682
- I barely made it.
- So it's down to Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

1084
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:07,919
[Now the only ones left are...
Blank Ji and Kwang-Star.]

1085
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,560
[The one to get their hand printed first
wins the mission!]

1086
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:16,665
[Who will be the one to win?]

1087
01:12:21,156 --> 01:12:25,082
[Blank Ji safely wins the battle.]

1088
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,100
What are you doing!

1089
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:29,474
She bit me and stole the box
away from me!

1090
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:33,489
[A strong way to express their
caring for the star.]

1091
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,462
- I kept calling out for you.
- Kwang Soo found a total of three boxes.

1092
01:12:36,463 --> 01:12:38,668
- He found three of our boxes.
- And you had all three taken away?

1093
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:42,198
- Thanks for all your hard work, Kwang Soo.
- What in the world are you doing?

1094
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:48,183
- What kind of a Hallyu star are you?
- You're so kind to help us out like this.

1095
01:12:48,184 --> 01:12:51,446
Isn't he so nice? You
should've just brought the first box down.

1096
01:12:51,447 --> 01:12:54,373
[Thanks to Kwang-Star for finding
three of their boxes for them.]

1097
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:57,336
<i>The victory goes to Team Suzy!</i>

1098
01:12:57,337 --> 01:13:00,597
[Hand printing mission- Team Suzy wins!]

1099
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:07,563
<i>You have another team member chance card,
but the number of members will be important.</i>

1100
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:09,872
Will having more be advantageous,
or will having less me more advantageous?

1101
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:12,634
Bring me back onto the team.

1102
01:13:14,214 --> 01:13:17,397
You can't go.
You're the star of this team.

1103
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:19,082
[Wants to abandon his own fan club?]

1104
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:21,584
What will become of us if you
were to leave?

1105
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:24,708
Since you're the Hallyu star,
you can't leave your team to join the other.

1106
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:26,405
I'm not a Hallyu star.

1107
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:28,741
- I want to go.
- Think about this very carefully.

1108
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:32,316
[Will Suzy get rid of a member,
or bring someone in?]

1109
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:33,362
I'm sorry for taking this box from you.

1110
01:13:33,363 --> 01:13:36,062
No need for you to apologize because
we're not even considering you.

1111
01:13:36,063 --> 01:13:37,977
I thought I'd mention that
just in case.

1112
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:40,326
Then I'll just come over there.

1113
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:45,345
- You can't go over there!
- In that case...

1114
01:13:45,346 --> 01:13:47,354
I'd like to...

1115
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:50,554
[Time for a decision.]

1116
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:57,599
- Suk Jin.
- What!

1117
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,088
[Did Suzy just choose Suk Jin?]

1118
01:14:01,089 --> 01:14:03,814
- She just said it.
- She meant to say, not Suk Jin.

1119
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:07,135
- Anyone other than him.
- Why are you speaking for her?

1120
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:10,023
- Suk Jin.
- What?

1121
01:14:10,024 --> 01:14:11,623
Me?

1122
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:14,422
[Even he himself is shocked.]

1123
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:18,306
[Completely unexpected!]

1124
01:14:19,382 --> 01:14:21,898
Suzy has a very unique side to her.

1125
01:14:23,022 --> 01:14:27,844
[Brings Suk Jin back since
they started the day out together.]

1126
01:14:27,845 --> 01:14:30,885
She's finally believing in
my unfailing love and loyalty to her.

1127
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:37,608
[Member chance card-
Suzy brings Big-nose in.]

1128
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:44,724
<i>We will move onto the final mission
with the existing members.</i>

1129
01:14:44,725 --> 01:14:47,025
<i>You will be walking over
to your next mission site.</i>

1130
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:49,022
- Really?
- It's right over there.

1131
01:14:49,662 --> 01:14:51,744
- It's the department store.
- Where?

1132
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,495
<i>The first team to arrive at the store
will be given a useful advantage.</i>

1133
01:14:58,496 --> 01:15:00,650
- Let's get going.
- Come on.

1134
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:03,309
[In that case, it's time to run!]

1135
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,413
- Are you sure this is the right way?
- Yes, this is the right way.

1136
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:11,553
[Suzy is hot on Team Giraffe's trail.]

1137
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:19,099
[Running through the city!]

1138
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:22,779
Hurry!

1139
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,613
[Team Giraffe is in the lead.]

1140
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:32,679
I'm only 21 years old,
but I'm the slowest!

1141
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:36,759
[Almost at their destination!]

1142
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:44,432
[Team Giraffe is the first to arrive.]

1143
01:15:44,988 --> 01:15:46,415
What's this?

1144
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,349
We're in big trouble now.

1145
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:52,227
[What is their final mission?]

1146
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:55,785
- What's this?
- Isn't this bell hide and go seek?

1147
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:01,535
[All-kill bell hide and seek race.]

1148
01:16:01,536 --> 01:16:03,026
<i>This is your final mission.</i>

1149
01:16:03,027 --> 01:16:07,587
<i>The ultimate Hallyu game.
All-kill bell name tag elimination.</i>

1150
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:10,901
[All-kill bell name tag elimination game.]

1151
01:16:10,902 --> 01:16:16,285
<i>Even though Suzy's been on the show a lot,
she's never played the name tag elimination.</i>

1152
01:16:16,286 --> 01:16:19,038
[First name tag elimination game for Suzy.]

1153
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:20,648
I'll get rid of you first.

1154
01:16:21,422 --> 01:16:24,496
- Why are you saying that to her?
- That's because she's our opponent.

1155
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:28,590
- You won't get away with it.
- It'll be split into two halves.

1156
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:33,621
<i>The two teams will take turns playing
the offense and defense side.</i>

1157
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:38,751
<i>It'll be played in an all-kill style until
all the opposing members are eliminated.</i>

1158
01:16:38,752 --> 01:16:40,771
We only have three members
on our team.

1159
01:16:40,772 --> 01:16:45,620
<i>The team who eliminates the opponents in
the shortest amount of time wins the game.</i>

1160
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:47,363
[Shortest amount of time wins the race.]

1161
01:16:49,206 --> 01:16:52,497
<i>You are free to roam between
the fourth and the seventh floor.</i>

1162
01:16:52,498 --> 01:16:55,984
Five members really is...

1163
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:58,095
Not only that, but they
also have Jong Kook on their team.

1164
01:16:58,096 --> 01:17:00,627
I haven't seen these bells in a long time.

1165
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:04,565
I've never wanted to win anything
so badly as this in my entire life.

1166
01:17:08,211 --> 01:17:12,531
[A forceful way to show his support
to his star.]

1167
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:15,948
- That's not it.
- Shut up!

1168
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:18,473
[Gives the Giraffe a water shower
to stop him from complaining even further.]

1169
01:17:18,474 --> 01:17:20,921
- Aren't you my fans?
- This is so maddening.

1170
01:17:20,922 --> 01:17:22,805
Ugh, this is so maddening.

1171
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,644
So the only plan is to drag this out
for as long as possible.

1172
01:17:25,645 --> 01:17:28,705
We can't stay together.

1173
01:17:28,706 --> 01:17:32,716
Let's drag this out until
those guys just give up.

1174
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:37,993
- Until they give up and wants to go home.
- It won't be easy with those three.

1175
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:40,382
<i>Ten seconds until the attack.</i>

1176
01:17:40,383 --> 01:17:43,193
[Ten seconds until the start of the race.]

1177
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,543
Hiding around here won't be easy.

1178
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,784
I think I'll hide right here.

1179
01:18:03,785 --> 01:18:05,699
Are you playing right now?

1180
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,197
[It's been awhile since I've had to
film a race too...]

1181
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,819
[All members of Team Suzy finish hiding.]

1182
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,616
<i>Start the attack!</i>

1183
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:17,012
We're going to have to start running.

1184
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:19,629
Fourth through the seventh floor?

1185
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,826
[You just wait!
We're coming for you!]

1186
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:26,153
[Time is of the essence!]

1187
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,598
Where are you going?
Come down one floor below.

1188
01:18:29,599 --> 01:18:31,492
Dong Hoon, he wants us to come down.

1189
01:18:31,493 --> 01:18:33,968
They could be hiding on the eighth floor.

1190
01:18:34,598 --> 01:18:36,668
- Aren't you the Hallyu star?
- Huh?

1191
01:18:36,669 --> 01:18:38,467
You want to start searching
from the seventh floor?

1192
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:41,858
[Extreme state of nervousness.
First ever bell race for Suzy.]

1193
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:44,615
I think I'm going to
run this way if I'm caught.

1194
01:18:49,443 --> 01:18:53,838
[Just then, Ha Ha comes down to
the fourth floor, where Suzy's hiding.]

1195
01:18:58,626 --> 01:19:00,175
I can hear the bell.

1196
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:04,151
[First time experiencing the terror
of the bells.]

1197
01:19:06,934 --> 01:19:12,888
[Ha Ha is coming up to the room
where Suzy is hiding.]

1198
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:21,193
[President Yoo is searching
through the toy department.]

1199
01:19:21,194 --> 01:19:24,156
[The sound of the bell is getting closer.]

1200
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,314
[Blank Ji's hiding spot!]

1201
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:32,250
[But Jae Suk just walks by it.]

1202
01:19:35,718 --> 01:19:40,674
I feel like I'm hearing an echo.
A constant echo of the bells.

1203
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,560
[It's not an echo,
but it really is the sound of the bells.]

1204
01:19:43,124 --> 01:19:46,424
That wasn't it, right?
I think I'm hearing things.

1205
01:19:46,425 --> 01:19:49,928
[All the members are on edge from
not having played the game in so long.]

1206
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,884
[Jae Suk is about to get on the elevator
after having passed by Blank Ji's hiding spot]

1207
01:19:56,321 --> 01:19:57,894
Where are they all hiding?

1208
01:19:58,654 --> 01:20:00,958
Should I just stay in the elevator?

1209
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:06,186
I just won't stay in the same spot.
I'll constantly keep moving.

1210
01:20:06,187 --> 01:20:08,738
I'll just go back and forth.
What do you think?

1211
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:10,749
That might not be a bad plan.

1212
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:15,014
If I see anyone, then I'll just do this.
Like Jung Min did in his movie.

1213
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:17,809
Come in.
All of you, come in.

1214
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,622
I can just do it like this.
Right?

1215
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,428
[Another man is hiding in the elevator.]

1216
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:26,396
What's going on here?

1217
01:20:26,397 --> 01:20:28,314
This is really scary.

1218
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,068
Did someone press the elevator button?

1219
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:33,598
[That means someone must've
pressed the elevator button.]

1220
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:41,315
[The whole Giraffe team.]

1221
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:43,507
You can't all go around together like this.

1222
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:52,259
[That's our race starter!
Big-nose is out!]

1223
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,937
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1224
01:20:56,938 --> 01:20:58,718
[Gary barely manages to escape
the danger of the elevator.]

1225
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,744
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1226
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:11,305
Hey, I can't even find anyone.

1227
01:21:13,303 --> 01:21:16,466
[Since they're weak in man power,
they've decided to stay together.]

1228
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:19,201
I think I hear something.

1229
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:22,675
[Ha Ha goes in to search
through the kitchen area.]

1230
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:30,061
[That's where Blank Ji was hiding!]

1231
01:21:31,003 --> 01:21:34,473
[But Ha Ha misses seeing her
and just passes her by!]

1232
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,023
[Is he gone?]

1233
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,651
[Ten years shaved off her life.]

1234
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,291
[This time, Kwang-Star
walks towards Blank Ji.]

1235
01:21:47,321 --> 01:21:51,209
[Looks into the room once again.]

1236
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:58,288
[Please... just go!]

1237
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:04,257
[Startles each other!]

1238
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:07,317
[Blank Ji is shocked.]

1239
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:13,415
- I just looked in there.
- I saw you.

1240
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:15,551
I just looked in there,
but I didn't even see anyone.

1241
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:20,651
[Song Ji Hyo- Out.]

1242
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:23,250
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1243
01:22:23,975 --> 01:22:27,579
[Hallyu Suzy lets her hair down.]

1244
01:22:29,272 --> 01:22:31,421
The reason why I let my hair down...

1245
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:34,077
is so that it won't be as easy
for them to rip off my name tag.

1246
01:22:35,003 --> 01:22:37,417
Let them try to pull my hair out.

1247
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:40,515
Kim Jong Kook might be hiding
in the emergency exit area.

1248
01:22:41,472 --> 01:22:44,576
[Searching through all the emergency exits.]

1249
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:48,028
[As predicted!]

1250
01:22:50,823 --> 01:22:52,114
Jae Suk!

1251
01:22:52,115 --> 01:22:54,956
[Kwang-star discovers Mr. Capable.]

1252
01:22:54,957 --> 01:22:57,008
- Where?
- Up above!

1253
01:22:57,009 --> 01:22:58,588
Up above?

1254
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:01,664
- Sixth or the seventh floor?
- Seventh floor!

1255
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,322
Up above!

1256
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:05,961
He's upstairs!

1257
01:23:07,854 --> 01:23:12,912
[Must corner Mr. Capable!]

1258
01:23:16,468 --> 01:23:18,654
[Looking for me?]

1259
01:23:19,524 --> 01:23:21,490
Kim Jong Kook is right here.

1260
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:24,630
[Even though they're on the attack,
when it comes to Jong Kook...]

1261
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:27,308
Look at what he's doing.

1262
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,706
Can't you just let us eliminate you?

1263
01:23:33,338 --> 01:23:35,441
Come on, stop doing that
and just let us do it.

1264
01:23:39,785 --> 01:23:43,183
[It's three against one, right?]

1265
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:48,034
[Not even able to budge.]

1266
01:23:48,766 --> 01:23:51,312
- Why are you doing this?
- Just let us go!

1267
01:23:52,512 --> 01:23:55,546
[The attack team is humiliated.]

1268
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,135
- What is the matter with you?
- Seriously!

1269
01:24:01,264 --> 01:24:05,632
[Angry Tiger throws
the Giraffe down to the ground.]

1270
01:24:05,633 --> 01:24:08,097
[And similar service to his fans.]

1271
01:24:08,098 --> 01:24:11,436
Ha Ha, you know what the worst thing
about this whole thing is?

1272
01:24:12,044 --> 01:24:14,703
It's the fact that this is for real.
None of this is acted out.

1273
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:18,291
He really made me crumble down
on the ground.

1274
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:20,846
This is so maddening.

1275
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,452
- This is making me mad.
- Let's go again on the count of three.

1276
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:27,864
- We can do this!
- One, two, three.

1277
01:24:27,865 --> 01:24:29,970
[A full-on attack.]

1278
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:33,219
[Muscle Tiger is surrounded.]

1279
01:24:34,645 --> 01:24:37,864
[The lives of these three are in danger.]

1280
01:24:45,938 --> 01:24:49,914
[Sounds of agony even after
having eliminated the Tiger.]

1281
01:24:50,456 --> 01:24:52,962
- Can't you just let us oust you?
- What?

1282
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:56,076
- Must you really do all this?
- Why do you make us go through all this!

1283
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:58,778
Seriously.

1284
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:01,016
[Kim Jong Kook- Out.]

1285
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:08,070
[Only two more left to go
before Team Suzy is ousted.]

1286
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:17,100
[Jae Suk closes in on Suzy.]

1287
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:21,336
[A nerve wrecking moment!]

1288
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:29,120
[But he doesn't see Suzy and
just passes by her hiding spot.]

1289
01:25:29,121 --> 01:25:30,584
I don't think anyone's here.

1290
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:35,752
[Uses this chance... to attempt an escape.]

1291
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:41,400
[With Kwang Soo right in front.
Very bold Suzy!]

1292
01:25:41,946 --> 01:25:47,582
[But... he spots her fleeing tail!]

1293
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:51,913
[Calls in members of his fan club
to take off on her trail.]

1294
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,788
It's Suzy!

1295
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:55,866
[Suzy desperately tries to hide.]

1296
01:25:57,116 --> 01:25:59,554
- She's around here somewhere.
- Who was it? Suzy?

1297
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:02,622
[Positive that this is where she's hiding...]

1298
01:26:07,344 --> 01:26:09,749
There's Suzy!

1299
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,244
- Hello.
- Hi Suzy.

1300
01:26:12,245 --> 01:26:14,349
I'm sorry, but there's no time.

1301
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:17,087
No, don't do that!
Please don't do that, Suzy.

1302
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:22,099
[Suzy does what she needs to
in order to ensure a win for her fan club.]

1303
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,498
I'm sorry, Suzy.

1304
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:26,825
[She tried to do what she could
to buy the team more time...]

1305
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:32,024
- Where have you been hiding?
- You did a good job of hiding.

1306
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:35,505
[Suzy's surprisingly good hiding skills.]

1307
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:38,232
I only saw her because she
ran out of her hiding spot.

1308
01:26:38,233 --> 01:26:41,113
[Suzy's surprising transformation into
a hunter will soon be revealed.]

1309
01:26:45,579 --> 01:26:50,243
[No more time to waste!]

1310
01:26:50,244 --> 01:26:54,207
[Gary is the only one left to eliminate.]

1311
01:27:02,329 --> 01:27:03,553
- Jae Suk.
- What?

1312
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:09,339
This light on the door indicates
that someone is in the room.

1313
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,300
It says that the room is occupied.

1314
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:15,388
[Darn!]

1315
01:27:15,389 --> 01:27:19,047
Don't you think that he's in there?
The light wouldn't be on otherwise.

1316
01:27:19,048 --> 01:27:21,415
The door was open earlier.
Open the door.

1317
01:27:21,798 --> 01:27:24,029
[No...]

1318
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,061
I know that the door was
unlocked earlier.

1319
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:31,565
[No matter how hard he tries
to keep it closed...]

1320
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:38,229
[Excuse us.]

1321
01:27:38,839 --> 01:27:40,643
No!

1322
01:27:42,603 --> 01:27:44,522
Don't do this!

1323
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:48,083
Gary's a really good hider.

1324
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,932
- You almost had us.
- But the light was lit.

1325
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,018
[Team Suzy's last survivor is caught.]

1326
01:27:55,093 --> 01:27:57,368
- The occupied light came on?
- The light was on.

1327
01:27:57,369 --> 01:28:00,547
- Why would the light turn on?
- I really had no idea you'd be here.

1328
01:28:00,548 --> 01:28:02,296
[The darn green light...]

1329
01:28:05,641 --> 01:28:08,346
[Onto the second half-
Time to switch the attack team.]

1330
01:28:08,347 --> 01:28:10,524
You need to know what this is all about
since you've never done this before.

1331
01:28:10,525 --> 01:28:12,090
I'll hold them down,
and you can rip off the tags.

1332
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:15,294
It's actually quite fun.
Give it a try.

1333
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:20,026
You're good at that.
You have to just rip it off like that.

1334
01:28:20,113 --> 01:28:22,934
I've only done it about two times myself.

1335
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:27,389
[Suzy's highly anticipated hunting skills.]

1336
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:30,288
Suzy, Suzy, fighting!

1337
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:34,436
[Team Suzy's attack.]

1338
01:28:34,437 --> 01:28:37,433
[Faster time gets them the win!]

1339
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:40,861
I hear the bells.

1340
01:28:45,207 --> 01:28:47,084
There are a lot of pretty clothes in here.

1341
01:28:47,085 --> 01:28:49,968
I need to get out of here
because I can't concentrate.

1342
01:28:49,969 --> 01:28:52,644
There are way too many pretty
clothes in here.

1343
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:58,181
[Kkuk is on the search for
all the emergency exits.]

1344
01:29:00,818 --> 01:29:02,616
Emergency exit!

1345
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:06,944
[As predicted, Ha Ha runs over
to the emergency exit.]

1346
01:29:09,672 --> 01:29:13,638
[Just then...]

1347
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:16,382
[Makes a fast escape away
from the sound of the bell.]

1348
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:19,040
[But he runs into a dead end!]

1349
01:29:20,283 --> 01:29:23,528
[Gary closes in on Ha Ha.]

1350
01:29:23,529 --> 01:29:26,252
[Decides to escape head on.]

1351
01:29:26,952 --> 01:29:29,683
[Where do you think you're going?]

1352
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:33,390
Come here, let me see your back.

1353
01:29:37,943 --> 01:29:40,738
[Ha Ha is ousted within three minutes.
A record breaker!]

1354
01:29:42,616 --> 01:29:44,299
Sorry, I had no choice.

1355
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:49,194
[With only three members on the team,
every single member is precious!]

1356
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:52,438
<i>Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.</i>

1357
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:56,066
[We're in trouble!]

1358
01:29:56,684 --> 01:30:00,294
<i>Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.</i>

1359
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:01,912
[Already?]

1360
01:30:03,385 --> 01:30:06,568
[Hunter Suzy is getting fired up with
the announcement of the first elimination.]

1361
01:30:08,961 --> 01:30:13,161
[Suzy's on the sixth floor,
where Jae Suk and Kwang Soo are hiding.]

1362
01:30:14,914 --> 01:30:18,345
[The sound of the bell is getting closer...]

1363
01:30:42,711 --> 01:30:46,394
[But Suzy isn't about to let them get away!]

1364
01:30:48,815 --> 01:30:50,538
Suzy, just go.

1365
01:30:50,539 --> 01:30:53,061
Ji Hyo!
Over here!

1366
01:30:53,062 --> 01:30:55,182
Over here, Ji Hyo!

1367
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:58,514
[Kwang-Star abandons his fan
to flee by himself.]

1368
01:30:59,957 --> 01:31:02,057
- Where?
- Over here in the elevator!

1369
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:03,765
Which floor?

1370
01:31:03,766 --> 01:31:05,386
In the elevator!

1371
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:09,631
[President Yoo also attempts
to make his escape.]

1372
01:31:12,526 --> 01:31:14,698
Why isn't this working!

1373
01:31:16,342 --> 01:31:19,300
[President Yoo can't let his star
go off on his own.]

1374
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:24,234
[Suzy keeps her firm grasp on Jae Suk.]

1375
01:31:24,235 --> 01:31:25,829
Ji Hyo!

1376
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:28,378
[Doesn't give up on her chase.]

1377
01:31:29,725 --> 01:31:32,655
- They're heading down!
- There they are!

1378
01:31:34,517 --> 01:31:36,347
Go up!

1379
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,793
[Suzy corners Jae Suk onto the escalator.]

1380
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:43,247
[Kkuk runs up the steps after
seeing Jae Suk at the top.]

1381
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:51,264
[Suzy successfully eliminates
her very first name tag!]

1382
01:31:52,304 --> 01:31:54,163
Okay, only one more left to go.

1383
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:58,742
[Suzy successfully corners
Jae Suk all by herself.]

1384
01:31:59,612 --> 01:32:01,809
Where did Kwang Soo go?

1385
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,400
Where did he run off to?

1386
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:06,770
- Here you go.
- Come on, Suzy!

1387
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,789
You did great, Suzy.

1388
01:32:09,472 --> 01:32:11,634
This really isn't right.

1389
01:32:11,635 --> 01:32:14,812
I really hope that my star
remains alive.

1390
01:32:15,394 --> 01:32:18,031
[Jae Suk- Out.]

1391
01:32:21,838 --> 01:32:25,704
[Kwang-Star is the only remaining survivor!]

1392
01:32:25,705 --> 01:32:27,700
Turn off the light!

1393
01:32:29,318 --> 01:32:31,412
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
ran off at the same time, right?

1394
01:32:31,413 --> 01:32:34,902
They split up like this. Jae Suk
one way, and Kwang Soo, the other.

1395
01:32:34,903 --> 01:32:38,440
- Then where did Kwang Soo go?
- I think he went that way.

1396
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,944
I'll go check the emergency exit areas.

1397
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:43,102
I'll go check the other one.

1398
01:32:43,103 --> 01:32:45,362
Where could he be?

1399
01:32:46,573 --> 01:32:49,644
Kwang Soo, make it easy on yourself
and just surrender.

1400
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:55,678
[Kwang-Star is hiding in the darkness of
the restaurant storage on the sixth floor.]

1401
01:32:56,284 --> 01:32:57,996
Can you not see me?

1402
01:32:58,548 --> 01:33:00,070
Where did he go?

1403
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:04,908
[Suzy is headed up to the sixth floor,
where Kwang Soo is hiding.]

1404
01:33:04,909 --> 01:33:07,216
He ran up here, didn't he?

1405
01:33:07,217 --> 01:33:09,429
[Gary is also on the sixth floor.]

1406
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:15,946
He ran up here...
and I saw him running across.

1407
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:17,728
In there, I think.

1408
01:33:19,398 --> 01:33:25,615
[Not in any of the open rooms,
or in the hallways either.]

1409
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:29,357
[Wait, that's the storage room
where Kwang Soo is hiding!]

1410
01:33:29,358 --> 01:33:31,096
Someone's coming!

1411
01:33:33,647 --> 01:33:35,192
I'm getting a weird vibe in here.

1412
01:33:39,597 --> 01:33:44,735
[Wait, those are... a pair of shoes?]

1413
01:33:44,736 --> 01:33:47,840
[Did I see it wrong?]

1414
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:53,884
[Discovers a crumbled up figure of
Kwang Soo behind the curtain.]

1415
01:33:56,283 --> 01:33:58,096
How did you know that I was in here?

1416
01:33:59,132 --> 01:34:01,160
Come on, I'll let you go.

1417
01:34:01,161 --> 01:34:03,021
I won't eliminate you right now,
so follow me out here.

1418
01:34:03,022 --> 01:34:05,472
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm taking you out of here.

1419
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,508
Just follow me.

1420
01:34:07,509 --> 01:34:09,551
So that's where you've been hiding?

1421
01:34:09,552 --> 01:34:11,946
You have nowhere to run anyway,
so just follow me.

1422
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:14,868
[Attempts to talk to him
away from the eyes of others.]

1423
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,262
[Once a traitor, always a traitor!]

1424
01:34:20,263 --> 01:34:22,863
[Shuts the door and runs!]

1425
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:28,146
[Escapes into one of the dining rooms.]

1426
01:34:29,809 --> 01:34:31,389
<i>Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

1427
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:33,388
<i>Over here!</i>

1428
01:34:33,977 --> 01:34:37,283
[Kwang Soo crawls under the table to hide.]

1429
01:34:38,344 --> 01:34:42,480
[Gary sets off again in search of Kwang Soo.]

1430
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:44,974
- Which floor?
- Lee Kwang Soo's up here!

1431
01:34:44,975 --> 01:34:47,278
[All members of Team Suzy gathers
at the sound of Gary's voice.

1432
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:49,175
- I should've just eliminated him.
- Gary.

1433
01:34:49,176 --> 01:34:51,193
He's up here somewhere.

1434
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:54,002
- He's around here somewhere.
- Where is he?

1435
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,372
Where did he go?
Is he in the emergency exit?

1436
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,911
[All Kkuk's been talking about all day
are about the emergency exits.]

1437
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,718
He was in the restaurant?

1438
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:08,732
I'm sorry, President Yoo.

1439
01:35:08,733 --> 01:35:12,993
And to Director Ha Ha... I'm so very sorry.

1440
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:18,409
But today is the last day of my fan club.

1441
01:35:21,103 --> 01:35:22,850
Kwang Soo.

1442
01:35:26,984 --> 01:35:33,922
[That door was definitely open earlier.]

1443
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:36,097
Don't you think that he would've
went out this way?

1444
01:35:37,796 --> 01:35:39,934
[Please...]

1445
01:35:42,742 --> 01:35:45,051
I don't think he's in this restaurant, do you?

1446
01:35:45,052 --> 01:35:47,965
This is the only room he could be in.

1447
01:35:47,966 --> 01:35:49,594
I think he's in here.

1448
01:35:49,595 --> 01:35:51,676
- There he is.
- He's in there, isn't he?

1449
01:35:51,677 --> 01:35:54,219
He's in there, isn't he?
Jong Kook!

1450
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:56,663
- No, just keep the door shut.
- We'll keep it shut.

1451
01:35:56,664 --> 01:35:59,023
[Keeps the tricky Giraffe locked up inside.]

1452
01:35:59,024 --> 01:36:01,943
[Calls for Jong Kook with
the Giraffe locked up in the room.]

1453
01:36:01,944 --> 01:36:04,170
- Where is he?
- In here.

1454
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:06,410
[Jong Kook is on the way!]

1455
01:36:06,411 --> 01:36:08,200
[Doing whatever he can to get out.]

1456
01:36:12,127 --> 01:36:14,338
Come on and rip it off, Suzy.

1457
01:36:15,996 --> 01:36:20,443
[It's a battle against time.
Time to get the Giraffe.]

1458
01:36:20,444 --> 01:36:24,273
[Giraffe's attempt to escape
out the side door.]

1459
01:36:25,576 --> 01:36:28,055
[Time to end the battle.]

1460
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,574
I'm sorry to all my fan club members!

1461
01:36:33,567 --> 01:36:36,825
[Hallyu star Suzy herself eliminates
minor star, Kwang Soo.]

1462
01:36:38,977 --> 01:36:40,881
- Is it over?
- It's all over.

1463
01:36:40,882 --> 01:36:42,669
It's over.

1464
01:36:46,182 --> 01:36:48,297
Here are the final results.

1465
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:51,540
I will now reveal the time it took
to eliminate Team Kwang Soo.

1466
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:54,615
- I don't think it even took 20 minutes.
- We were eliminated very quickly.

1467
01:36:55,369 --> 01:36:58,191
14 minutes and 16 seconds.

1468
01:36:58,192 --> 01:36:59,697
[Elimination time- 14 minutes and 16 seconds.]

1469
01:36:59,698 --> 01:37:02,991
[They lasted longer than expected.]

1470
01:37:02,992 --> 01:37:06,466
The time it took for Team Kwang Soo
to eliminate the members of Team Suzy was...

1471
01:37:06,467 --> 01:37:10,811
- Is it pretty close?
- It's in the tens.

1472
01:37:10,812 --> 01:37:13,205
In the tens?

1473
01:37:13,206 --> 01:37:15,874
[Could it be?]

1474
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:17,898
19 minutes and 8 seconds.

1475
01:37:17,899 --> 01:37:20,772
[Team Giraffe- 19 minutes and 8 seconds.
Team Suzy- 14 minutes and 16 seconds.]

1476
01:37:20,773 --> 01:37:24,457
[Team Suzy wins!]

1477
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,577
[Sorry, Kwang-Star...]

1478
01:37:29,578 --> 01:37:32,037
- Suzy's the best.
- You guys worked hard.

1479
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:36,357
As a prize for winning,
Suzy will receive a trophy.

1480
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:39,273
[A special gift for Suzy for winning
the Hallyu star race.]

1481
01:37:41,373 --> 01:37:43,537
- Is that real gold?
- This is huge!

1482
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:46,443
[A gold trophy!]

1483
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,147
Wow, that's pretty.
That's really pretty.

1484
01:37:49,148 --> 01:37:52,015
That's really befitting of a Hallyu star.
It's a pretty trophy.

1485
01:37:52,016 --> 01:37:54,919
Bae Suzy!

1486
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:00,195
I will continue to work hard
as not to disappoint anyone.

1487
01:38:00,196 --> 01:38:02,147
Thank you, Suzy.

1488
01:38:02,148 --> 01:38:04,267
Let's all get old together.

1489
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:08,283
[Yes, let's continue to see each other
for long time to come.]

1490
01:38:08,284 --> 01:38:10,243
Can Kwang-Star also say a word?

1491
01:38:10,244 --> 01:38:15,964
- Winning wasn't what was important.
- No, it was very important to us.

1492
01:38:16,863 --> 01:38:18,930
Why are we even bothering to do this
if winning isn't important?

1493
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:21,319
You really are so maddening.

1494
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:29,159
Congratulations to the winner of the race,
Bae Suzy!

1495
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,921
Thank you!

1496
01:38:30,922 --> 01:38:34,193
[Wishing nothing but luck to our
very own Hallyu star, Suzy!]
