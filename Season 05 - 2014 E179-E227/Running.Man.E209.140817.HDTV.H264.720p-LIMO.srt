Why are you all so tired?

108
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:11,058
I'm so tired.

109
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:18,687
You're drenched in sweat!

110
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,299
Ma'am!

111
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,208
You look like an old woman!

112
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,893
Anyway...

113
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:26,742
All these young kids were so good
with their jumping...

114
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:29,545
But how come all your jumps were
so erratic?

115
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:32,348
Some of you were too forward,
some were too back...

116
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,882
In the 90s, it was customary
to jump and land forward.

117
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,331
That's right!

118
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:38,559
We had to jump and land forward!

119
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,324
Then every one of you
should've landed forward.

120
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:45,643
How come only a few of you landed forward
and the others landed backward?

121
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:49,506
And what is this Jikiri dude doing here?

122
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:52,052
[Jikiri: Ha Ha's former group of three men]

123
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,902
And a dude from X-Teen is here too!

124
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,633
That's a false accusation!

125
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:59,661
My popularity is a recent development!
[Gary used to be X-Teen's Guest Performer]

126
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,506
I'm still considered
as a new singer!

127
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:02,975
We have so much history!

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,922
Hee Jun is still cute.

129
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,829
Is that so?

130
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,541
You did get a bit shorter.
But it's okay.

131
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,304
Everyone's pants got tighter, right?

132
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:15,871
- We used to use pins to hold them up!
- Right! And rubber bands!

133
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,469
I used to wear size 40 pants.

134
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:22,587
They don't sell those pants anymore,
so I had to patch some things up last night.

135
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:27,556
My fashion coordinator did
a lot of work last night.

136
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:31,451
I couldn't refuse the result of her hard work,
so I had to wear these.

137
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:37,117
And I couldn't find real goggles,
so I just pasted something here.

138
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,916
What are these?

139
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:49,422
Do you think SM Entertainment
couldn't afford a pair of goggles back then?

140
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,768
<i>Ji Won isn't wearing his
real costume either!</i>

141
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,794
- This is my real costume!
- Really?

142
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,318
Don't you think this is too new?

143
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:00,248
To be honest, I made this from
a regular dress shirt.

144
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:03,845
So you can see my undershirt.
This needs more work...

145
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:07,201
That's fine! We'll be running on Running Man,
so your undershirt is fine...

146
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,346
I'm sorry...

147
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:14,268
Because they had me dressed like this,
even my jokes are from the 90s!

148
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,177
Damn it!

149
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,604
<i>That joke would've worked in the 90s!</i>

150
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:22,078
Take a good look, you guys.

151
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:28,589
You should save some of your costumes just in
case you go on a variety show decades later!

152
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,944
[Learn from Hee Jun's mistake!]

153
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:34,830
Every team has a girl.
How come my team doesn't have one?

154
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,836
Your team has you!

155
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,013
[He looks like an old lady
who came out to take a stroll]

156
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:43,696
You are definitely the old lady
of the team!

157
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:46,572
Fine, just wait and see what it feels like
to be killed by an old lady.

158
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:50,254
Say what?
Just wait and see?

159
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,161
So why are we divided into
three teams?

160
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,468
So we have
Team Running Idol...

161
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,736
Team Original Idol...

162
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:01,190
And Team New Idol.
Three teams.

163
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,244
Then what is he doing there?

164
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:06,003
[We'll treat him as the manager
of Team New Idol.]

165
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:10,000
<i>So the theme of today's games
will be the number three.</i>

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,847
<i>It's called the Triangular Mystery Race.</i>

167
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,506
[Triangular Mystery Race.]

168
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:19,838
<i>The team which solves the mystery
related to a triangle will be the final winner.</i>

169
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:25,705
<i>Each team will get different hints according
to how successful it was after each round.</i>

170
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:31,111
<i>The team that solves the triangular mystery
in the end with all the hints will be the winner.</i>

171
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,110
Just like a triangular sushi.

172
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,911

That can end your tenure on this program!

178

You might get kicked out
of this program forever!

179
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,303

180
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:56,729

[What...]
[What is he saying...]

182
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,019
She could neither open
her mouth nor close it!

- Soyou! Come to our team!
- Let her speak!

- Am I stuck with him until the end?
- Yes!

- I don't get to choose?
- No!

186

- We're the guests!

Please take care of us!

200

[All of us used to be friends and rivals
back in the 90s...]

belonged to us with our fans.]

[We'll revive the passion
from our past together!]

204

back in the day.

205
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:01,036
- And we've made it so far!
- That's right.

206
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:05,044
Just look how he turned out.
He must have gone through a lot...

207
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:09,192
I'm still swollen from the fatigue
from my heyday.

208
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,706
My body won't go back!

209
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,507
Pumpkin can help with swelling.

210
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,026
Pumpkin?
I should eat more?

211
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,529
You want to eat even more?

212
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,159
- Pumpkin is good for you.
- Really?

213
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:27,191

<i>You came with your goggles?</i>

218
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:48,694
My coordinator says she had no idea
the opening segment would be that short.

219
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,860
She says I should use them more.

220
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,759
<i>She did spend the
whole night making them!</i>

221
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,051
She told me to not waste them!
So I put them on here.

222
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:59,071
It was inconceivable to see you all
together back in the 90s.

223
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,803
How could you all be here together?

224
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,652
Jong Kook is our focal point.

225

[Everyone under me!]

226

[Intimidated]

228
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:16,096
Look at Hee Jun. He'll forever
be a junior in front of Jong Kook!

229
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,552
When I was changing with Gary...

230
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,304
I saw that on Ji Won's knee.
So I asked him why he has it on.

231
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:24,455
He said, "Old age."

232
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,041
- You have other health problems too.
- My shoulders.

233
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,407
Because of too much popping...

234
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:36,268
Be careful of this, Tae Min.

248
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,052
We got this.

249
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,573
- We're really bad at basketball.
- That's fine.

250
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,900
- Do you know how to play?
- Yes...

251
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,390
Did you see how he was befuddled?

252
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,344
As soon as he started talking about basketball,
the whole team said they're bad at it!

253
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,787
Soyou was the best.

254
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:37,789
She closed by saying
"Do you know how to play?"

255
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,172
That was probably unexpected.

256
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,364
<i>Every team will send one member
on the yellow pad.</i>

257
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:50,875
<i>Each team will get one of the pads and
try to send the ball to their teammate on the yellow pad.</i>

258
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,997
<i>Only the shots from the team's own
pad will be counted.</i>

259
00:16:54,997 --> 00:17:01,186
<i>And no matter who the shooter is, a point
will be given to the team that catches the ball.</i>

260
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,075
<i>For example, even if Kim Jong Kook
shoots the ball towards his teammate...</i>

261
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,848
<i>if the other team's member catches it,
the point will be given to the other team.</i>

262
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,944
- So the goalie is the most important one.
- That's right.

263
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:14,684
The goalie doesn't matter for you.
Just do what Jong Kook tells you.

264
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:18,269
Running Man is all about
dishonor, slyness, and deception.

265

Kook is dictating over everyone.
What is he telling you to do?

271
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:46,497
He can just tell us nicely,
but he continues to talk like this!

272
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,655
I told you already!

273
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:51,105

00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,855
Where did you blowdry your hair?

521
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:09,136
Team New Idol is quite competitive!

522
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:13,337
You need to talk the talk and
walk the walk!

523
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,343
What?
Talk the talk?

524
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:20,492
- You would've lost without Soyou!
- That was our whole strategy!

525
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:22,696
Soyou did very well!

526
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:26,827
<i>Team Original Idol used to be
very energetic like that...</i>

527
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,824
Let's stop talking about our past.
We're still alive and well!

528
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:34,438
We're still here, making this show!
We're not dead yet!

529
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:37,455
I'm still alive!
[How dare you!]

530
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,822
He just made us laugh out so hard!

531
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:44,577
You know we have those
sunscreen sprays, right?

532
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:46,997
My coordinator brought me one.
So...

533
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,799
Suk Jin closed his eyes
and asked me to spray it on him.

534
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:52,807
So I went like this with my mouth...

535
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:54,856
Then he went...

536
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,304
[Maintaining his skin with
Yoo Hyuk's saliva!]

537
00:37:57,304 --> 00:37:59,996
I was totally fooled!

538
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,317
[Embarrassed]

539
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:08,026
I couldn't feel anything!

540
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:10,442
But he kept going like this!

541
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:17,449
Hold on.
Why are there thigh bands?

542
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,939
- Perhaps...
- Could it be that...

543
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,085
<i>I said number three would
be the theme of today.</i>

544
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,779
<i>This is Triangular Wrestling!</i>

545
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:29,762
<i>The second stage will be Korean Wrestling.</i>

546
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:36,265
<i>We have three different rings
as it'll be Triangular Wrestling.</i>

547
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:39,522
<i>One is just a regular sand ring.</i>

548
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:44,413
<i>But there is something special
about the other two rings.</i>

549
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:50,620
<i>We'll do the wrestling in one of
these rings picked by you.</i>

550
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,840
<i>Since we have three teams, we need to
pick a team that will skip to the final round.</i>

551
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,947
<i>You'll play at the corresponding ring
after choosing one of these blocks.</i>

552
00:38:57,947 --> 00:39:00,690
<i>The objective would be to
take the name tag.</i>

553
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,058
[Which ring would be their fighting ground?]

554
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:05,547
[Ring Number Two!]

555
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:10,395
<i>Let's reveal the rings!
Please reveal!</i>

556
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:14,889
[What kind of special rings are they?]

557
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,756
[Ring Number One is a water ring]

558
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:24,308
[Ring Number Three is a regular sand ring]

559
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:28,126
The Ring Number Two must be the weird one!

560
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,443
[Ring Number Two is making everyone scream.]

561
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,692
[A mud ring]

562
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:41,821
Is it mud or cement?

563
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:45,031
If it's real cement,
the loser won't be able to get out!

564
00:39:45,655 --> 00:39:48,638
[Full of mud that's good for skin!]

565
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:54,244
<i>We brought 2.4 tons of mud from
Boryeong Mud Festival.</i>

566
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,125
This is good for your skin!

567
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,166
<i>Please send a person to
represent your team.</i>

568
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,549
Come on, Hee Jun!

569
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:06,131
I just dried my hair!

570
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:10,860
I can't put mud on myself
in front of these young guys!

571
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,952
I can't be a dirty fattie!

572
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:17,957
- Just do it!
- You shouldn't have dried your hair!

573
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,820
We'll send Kai!

574
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,917
Come, Kai.
Go, Kai.

575
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,857
I'll let it slide because
he's SHINee.

576
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:31,834
Such a joke will not work
in ten years!

577
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:35,317
You have to keep working hard!

578
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:37,794
Tae Min only learned from you!

579
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:40,302
- Suk Jin should do it.
- Why me?

580
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:43,408
Unless they're going to pick a girl,
Suk Jin is a good choice.

581
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,904
What are you talking about?

582
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,106
He's the next best thing
to facing a girl.

583
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:54,971
Kai, Suk Jin, and Hee Jun will fight to decide
which team advances to the final directly.

584
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:57,468
I'll show you
what tag ripping is all about.

585
00:40:57,781 --> 00:41:01,019
There'll be a moment
when you'll be facing someone directly.

586
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:04,037
That's when you just need to go in!

587
00:41:05,612 --> 00:41:07,804
- How handsome...
- Just go in!

588
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:10,852
You need to go in more than you think.
Also...

589
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,452
He won't be able to use
what Jong Kook tells him.

590
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:16,129
His skills are only for
those with a lot of power.

591
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,508
Don't waste your energy!

592
00:41:21,508 --> 00:41:24,035
[Ha Ha's prediction is correct...]

593
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:26,946
I think you're just too strong.

594
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:29,457
If you worry about your inside,
the tag will be gone.

595
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:33,127
So don't worry about your tag.
Just focus on ripping the other tags!

596
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,638
Go inside when the opponent
is putting his guard down.

597
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:39,979
Make it as dirty, evil, and
deceitful as possible.

598
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:43,577
Remember our motto.
We have to do them too.

599
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:46,509
<i>Representatives, please enter the ring.</i>

600
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,885
Players, please go in!

601
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,566
- Are you going to wear them?
- Should I go barefoot?

602
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:57,656
I think they'll come off.

603
00:41:57,656 --> 00:42:01,492
You're wearing shoes that look like you!
Very round!

604
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:05,240
My mom got them for me!

605
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:09,006
<i>The winning team will
advance to the finals directly!</i>

606
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:15,337
[Mismatched]

607
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:17,990
Roar!

608
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,274
[Their inharmonious cheer
is not helping...]

609
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:24,257
Please get ready.
Only one match!

610
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,588
Kai, think carefully!

611
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:33,470
Stop talking and just go in!

612
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,754
Give Hee Jun a nice mud bath!

613
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,170
No thanks!

614
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,838
Quit talking and just come at me!

615
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:43,824
Don't provoke them!

616
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:46,712
Step aside, Kai.

617
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:50,366
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't say things like that!

618
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:52,853
[He must be out of his mind.]

619
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:54,166
I love EXO!

620
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,821
<i>Don't do things like that!</i>

621
00:42:56,821 --> 00:43:03,868
- Don't do this!
- Ji Suk Jin!

622
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,176
Defense!

623
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:09,347
I'll get rid of this old man first!

624
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:14,289
Who are you calling an old man?
You fattie!

625
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,876
Fattie!
[Cutesy]

626
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:21,414
Remember what Jong Kook taught you!

627
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:24,436
[Hee Jun charges forward!]

628
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,101
[He got it!]

629
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:29,781
[Can he do it?]

630
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:36,755
[What?]

631
00:43:36,755 --> 00:43:38,844
[Big Nosed Brother grabbed the tag too.]

632
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:45,353
[Big Nosed Brother was quicker!]

633
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,715
He's out.
Get him out of here!

634
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:49,735
Go away!

635
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,719
Wow, Suk Jin!
I couldn't even see it!

636
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,929
Suk Jin was so quick!

637
00:43:56,929 --> 00:44:00,408
Let's win!

638
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:04,238
He's done this quite often.

639
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:08,448
[Using deceitful tricks
just as Haroro taught him.]

640
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:10,760
Don't cut him any slack
because he's EXO!

641
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,358
EXO is dead to me!

642

643
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:19,262
<i>You've been doing this
for four years!</i>

644
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:22,419
- You need to lose your shoes!
- It's fine! Just continue!

645
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:28,186
[Kai is pushing forward]

646
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:32,559
Rip it!

647
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,731
No!

648
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:39,607
[They both grabbed each other's
name tags!]

649
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:42,573
[Who'll rip it first?]

650
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:48,606
[Kai was faster!]

651
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,426
[Kai ripped it first...]

652
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:59,572
[Then Big Nosed Brother!]

653
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:03,210
Kai did it first!

654
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,644
[Great performance by Kai!]

655
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:09,366
We're going to be killed
by Jong Kook!

656
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,083
Look how angry he is!

657
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:16,184
- Great job!
- Well done!

658
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,543
Very cute!
[Posing as if nothing happened]

659
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:24,301
He just danced.

Let's just do it in mud!

664
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,150
I liked playing in mud.

667
00:45:46,607 --> 00:45:49,333
We need a ring that
might cause Jong Kook to slip!

668
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:54,160
I'll put your face in it

That was just a performance
from him!

678

Jong Kook is so angry right now!

679
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:31,434
He's become quite spiteful!

680
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:34,418

like him!

That's why you need to let go of them!

- What if it's three?
- I don't think it is!

01:32:49,371 --> 01:32:53,041
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine!

1389
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:55,723
[Mysteriously, they all think
a rectangle is a triangle.]

1390
01:32:55,723 --> 01:32:57,418
I hate rectangles!

1391
01:32:57,418 --> 01:33:00,844
I'm sick of rectangles...

1392
01:33:00,844 --> 01:33:03,134
- That's good!
- No, this isn't it.

1393
01:33:03,134 --> 01:33:06,690
- One, two, three...
- Another triangle right here!

1394
01:33:08,801 --> 01:33:13,652
But these are not triangles.

1395
01:33:14,973 --> 01:33:16,883
This is driving me crazy.

1396
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:20,278
[If you're stuck, take a sneak peak
at the room next door.]

1397
01:33:21,839 --> 01:33:24,780
They're behind us.

1398
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:29,189
[Brain overload]

1399
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:32,505
[And schizophrenia]

1400
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:37,765
If we do this,
this still is a rectangle.

1401
01:33:37,765 --> 01:33:40,674
Why are you laughing?

1402
01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:44,115
You should try it!
It's not easy!

1403
01:33:44,115 --> 01:33:46,635
Do you know the answer?

1404
01:33:48,651 --> 01:33:52,505
Let's take some steps back.
Here...

1405
01:33:52,913 --> 01:33:55,576
- I think it's a star.
- Let's make it again.

1406
01:33:55,576 --> 01:33:59,736
This is a star.
My wife.

1407
01:34:00,782 --> 01:34:02,169
This isn't it.

1408
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:05,079
This is driving me nuts!

1409
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:07,029
[Schizophrenia is happening.]

1410
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:08,685
Let's start from here.

1411
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:11,690
We have three...

1412
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:14,775
Let's think again...

1413
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:23,497
- Let's think again.
- We can have three lines.

1414
01:34:24,718 --> 01:34:27,016
We only need three lines.

1415
01:34:27,016 --> 01:34:30,653
I think the longest one
should go up here.

1416
01:34:30,653 --> 01:34:31,613
It should go.

1417
01:34:31,996 --> 01:34:36,337
[These guys only need two more lines...]

1418
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:41,495
[They have four triangles
with six lines.]

1419
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:46,502
This way...

1420
01:34:46,502 --> 01:34:48,372
We had nine before!

1421
01:34:48,372 --> 01:34:50,346
No, we didn't.

1422
01:34:50,346 --> 01:34:54,646
[Big Nosed Brother puts the last line on.]

1423
01:34:55,947 --> 01:34:59,141
This isn't a triangle...

1424
01:34:59,346 --> 01:35:03,152
We have eight.
We need one more.

1425
01:35:03,152 --> 01:35:06,306
Can they give us
one more line?

1426
01:35:06,306 --> 01:35:09,186
It can happen with what we have...

1427
01:35:11,212 --> 01:35:13,606
Right here...

1428
01:35:13,744 --> 01:35:18,638
- In the middle...
- What if...

1429
01:35:18,638 --> 01:35:22,308
What'll happen if we move this?

1430
01:35:22,308 --> 01:35:26,604
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

1431
01:35:26,604 --> 01:35:30,523
Nine!
We have nine!

1432
01:35:30,523 --> 01:35:33,092
We got it!

1433
01:35:33,653 --> 01:35:39,877
[Will they be able to escape the castle
by solving the mystery?]

1434
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:44,827
We have nine!

1435
01:35:48,504 --> 01:35:51,782
[Nine triangles, completed!]

1436
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:59,063
[The door is open!]

1437
01:35:59,981 --> 01:36:05,412
[They've escaped after solving the problem!]

1438
01:36:05,412 --> 01:36:10,244
[No way]

1439
01:36:15,304 --> 01:36:19,989
[Congratulations on your escape!]

1440
01:36:20,913 --> 01:36:24,166
- It's similar to ours!
- That's a rectangle!

1441
01:36:25,874 --> 01:36:29,917
Goodbye!

1442
01:36:31,234 --> 01:36:34,767
It's very similar to ours!

1443
01:36:34,767 --> 01:36:39,095

1444
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:42,881
[Tae Min is utilizing the beauty of curves.]

1445
01:36:44,114 --> 01:36:47,638

let's all leave!

1446
01:36:49,584 --> 01:36:50,989
[I'm going to freeload!]

1447
01:36:50,989 --> 01:36:53,056
Goodbye!

1448
01:36:56,546 --> 01:36:58,967
How can they close it right here?

1449
