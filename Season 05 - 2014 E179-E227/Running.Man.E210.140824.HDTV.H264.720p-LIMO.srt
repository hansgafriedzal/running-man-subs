00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:19,502
The reason why I'm here today...

166
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,805
it's because I'm facing
an alkkaggi challenge later on today.

167
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:26,826
[Alkkaggi?
That's what all this is about?]

168
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,821
[Seriously?]

169
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:31,150
Maybe I should give Ji Min a call.

170
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:35,247
- Why are you doing that?
- Just use one of us here!

171
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:41,747
- There's a gag concert rehearsal going on.
- Then what are you all doing here?

172
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,561
[Business skill-
Make your clients feel desperate.]

173
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,636
- You three are the only ones here right now?
- Are you not happy with us?

174
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:53,309
- No, it's not that.
- Stop beating around the bush and be honest.

175
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,086
- Just get to the point here.
- You guys are misunderstanding my point.

176
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,728
- Wait a second, you guys.
- Are you feeling flustered?

177
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:05,198
Wait, just take this.

178
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,494
[Flustered Employee Yoo hands out
his business card to the group.]

179
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:11,370
- Why did you give me two business cards?
- Wait!

180
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,987
I only need one,
but why did you give me two?

181
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,255
- He's trying to push himself on us.
- I'm not that type of a person!

182
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,685
Don't misunderstand my intentions.

183
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:24,097
- In case you don't have any work...
- I thought you were a good senior.

184
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:28,283
I'm not being picky with people,
so I don't want you to think that.

185
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:30,535
Where's Ji Min right now?

186
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:33,920
- I told you that he's at gag concert!
- Oh, I forgot you told me that.

187
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:39,005
Kwang Sup hasn't eaten yet, right?
Although I'm here on business...

188
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:42,015
Don't try to buy yourself more time by
feeding us so you can wait for more people.

189
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,499
- Just pick one of us now!
- Wow, you're really quick witted!

190
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:47,540
How did you know that was my plan?

191
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,082
I was debating whether I should
do the alkkaggi challenge or not

192
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,999
but I'm going to do it for sure.

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,470
- You've wounded my pride too much now.
- Don't you know me at all?

194
00:10:55,471 --> 00:11:00,753
It took me years before I was able to
find my success too.

195
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:04,421
I can't stand it when people try to get
their job done through connections.

196
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,703
Where's Ji Min?

197
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:14,724
[While Employee Yoo's busy wrestling
with his people connections...]

[Employee Kkuk arrives at SBS Building
with the spirit of the Tiger.]

199
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,218
Is this my battleground for the day?

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,546
Isn't that Tuna?
Tuna!

201
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,386
Tuna!

202

[He runs into Sa Yeon at the front
of the SBS building!]

203
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:40,291
- It's so great running into you!
- I didn't even do my hair today!

204
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,424
Is something going on here today?

205
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:46,234
[A surprise visit even from former
R Group shareholder, Jung Chan Woo.]

206

207
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:53,775
[Running into so many familiar faces
even before he enters the building.]

208
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:59,323
It's around here somewhere.

209
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:00,869

[Discovers some models shopping
at the clothing store on the first floor.]

213
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:15,075
I should walk on my tippy toes.

214
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,088
I should just walk like this.

215
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,105
I'm an employee of Running Man's
R Group for the day.

216

[Employee Gae gets to work
on these two beauties.]

[Employee Giraffe arrives at
JYP Entertainment.]

221
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,678
So this is where it's at.

222
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:52,013
[Front of JYP Entertainment is always full of
fans waiting for a glimpse of a celebrity.]

223

[Wonder Girls, 2PM, Miss A, Sun Mi etc...

- So I'm here for work.
- Seriously?

235
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:42,681
Is that why you look so handsome today?

236
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,451
I don't think anyone's told me that
in over 20 years.

and I was hoping that you could help me.

241

Alkkaggi?
Are you really playing that game?

242
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,107
I'm not quite sure of it myself
since I didn't find anything out myself.

243
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:12,988
[Who cares about alkkaggi...
Just as long as you'll be with me.]

244

and it's nice to meet you.

252

[Employee Blank Ji is almost to
her destination at Roxta Muzik.]

276
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,028

to a residential area?]

and win the game as well as a prize.

This is a very crucial event.

312
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:53,394
Every one of us plays the guitar,
so we're very good at using our fingers.

313
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:58,567
[That's so true!]

314
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:01,616
Your guitar playing does make you more skilled
in the way you manipulate your fingers.

315
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:04,978
It's not just a play thing,
but it's almost scientific for you.

Can't you feel their energy?

321
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:36,009
Okay, let's put the nervous energy aside
and go into the building.

00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,827
So this is the place.

325
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:58,620
[2012-2013 season's winning trophy.]

326
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:04,621
These are the handprints of
all the great players.

327
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,136
[A wall plaque of
all the players' handprints.]

328
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:10,135
His hand isn't that big.

329
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:13,182
His three point shooters
are like works of art.

330
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,794
[Heads toward the office with
excitement and anticipation.]

331
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,930
[The legendary Coach Moon Kyung Eun
is standing right in front of his eyes!]

332
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:33,943
[The pioneer of Korean basketball
with his explosive three point shooters.]

333
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:38,765
[The legendary Rambo shooter,
Moon Kyung Eun.]

334
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,186
I'm such a huge fan of yours,
and I greatly respect your work.

335
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,525
You're still pro ball player,
Moon Kyung Eun to me.

336
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,345
- Can I drink this?
- Yes, of course.

337
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,580
- You didn't put anything in here, did you?
- No, I didn't.

338
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,920
What would I have put in there?
I just put some of my love in there.

339
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,334
I really love you, Brother!
I was such a huge fan of yours!

340
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,412
[Back to CoKo Entertainment.]

341
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:09,252
I'm here to do my job, but I
feel like you're auditioning for me.

342
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:11,669
You guys are so forward.

343
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,177
Where's Joon Hyun?

344
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:21,058
I was just asking because I don't know
which one of you are good at alkkaggi.

345
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,834
The three of us are the best at that
of everyone here at CoKo.

346
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:28,523
We play alkkaggi all the time because
we don't have any other gigs to get to.

347
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:31,735
It's not like we're professionals
when it comes to alkkaggi either

348
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:33,780
and I'm sure that everyone else
is pretty much the same.

349
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:36,506
That's why your day to day
condition is most important.

350
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,005
So can I see how your luck is today?

351
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:43,012
Let's read up on our horoscope.
I'm the sign of the rat.

352
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,269
<i>Luck is shining down on you today</i>

353
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,016
<i>and there's a good chance
to earn great fortune.</i>

354
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:50,356
- Today's the day.
- See? Today's fortune looks great for me.

355
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:54,527
- Management of people is crucial.
- See? I knew it!

356
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:58,817
<i>Don't be anxious at heart because
what you need the most is already beside you.</i>

357
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,587
See? It says that what you need
is already right beside you.

358
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,446
<i>What you need is already
right beside you...</i>

359
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:11,364
But, this is what's important.
Here's the sign of the rat for 1972.

360
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:14,177
<i>Someone in your surroundings may try to
entice you into an undesirable result.</i>

361
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,249
[Someone in your surroundings may try to
entice you into an undesirable result.]

362
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,700
See?
It's written right here!

363
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,878
- But we're not trying to do any of the sort.
- Why don't we read our fortune?

364
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,362
Okay, let's read yours.
What year were you born?

365
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:25,586
I was born in '81.

366
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,757
<i>Everything starts by being in isolation.</i>

367
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,024
Then you should be in isolation today.

368
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,544
- What about you, Kwang Sup?
- I'm the sign of a monkey.

369
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:36,782
The sign of the monkey?
That's a good sign.

370
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:39,470
- Here it is?
- Really?

371
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,720
Listen to this carefully.

372
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:45,053
<i>Harder and tougher things get,
don't try to face the challenges head on.</i>

373
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:47,632
<i>Instead, learn ways to
go around your challenges.</i>

374
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:52,155
- This doesn't sound very good.
- Maybe you should go around this.

375
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:59,238
Even though this is just a mere baduk board
and baduk pieces that you're facing...

376
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:05,844
What you'll soon be joining me for in
Sangahmdong isn't just a mere alkkaggi game.

377
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:10,912
But we will be heading towards a dream...
towards a common goal...

378
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:16,596
But I am in search of a companion who will
help me bring home the dream and victory.

379
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:19,245
- A companion...
- Everyone, tell me where Ji Min is.

380
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:28,368
[Meanwhile, this building is filling up
with sounds of laughter and music.]

381
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:53,721
[Everyone's so full of cheer and excitement.]

382
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:56,476
[This impromptu concert's next song is...]

383
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:02,474
['You're just my style' by
Jangmi Yeogwan.]

384
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:14,402
[May I have this dance?]

385
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:36,664
<i>I'm sorry, but you're not my style.</i>

386
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,373
[Yes, I see...]

387
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:47,534
<i>You're not my style.</i>

388
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,561
[This rock star office is so full of
high spirited energy and excitement.]

389
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,768
[Time to choose the alkkaggi player.]

390
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,217
[Representative for Garlixx-
Jun Kyung Joon.]

391
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,540
[Very close to the finish line!]

392
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:11,009
[No Brain's Hwang Hyun Sung
is disqualified.]

393
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,495
Okay, let's go!

394
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,952
[Last but not least-
Jangmi Yeogwan's Yook Joong Wan!]

395
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,901
[Roxta Muzik's attic room
is overflowing with love and laughter.]

396
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,331
[Almost in the same line as
Garlixx's Kyung Joon's cap!]

397
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:41,214
[Time for some serious judging.]

398
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,123
I don't have a ruler,
but I do have a line we can use.

399
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:47,393
[That's the best he has?
A cord from a hairdryer?]

400
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:53,268
[First measures Jangmi Yeogwan
Joong Wan's distance.]

401
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,889
Okay.

402
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:58,117
[Compares that distance to that of
Kyung Joon's cap from Garlixx?]

403
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:00,388
[It's a bit further off!]

404
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:07,225
[Jangmi Yeogwan wins!]

405
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:13,737
Okay, we got it.
Joong Wan from Jangmi Yeogwan.

406
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,478
[Roxta Muzik's representative is,
Yook Joong Wan of Jangmi Yeogwan.]

407
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,929
Let's go.

408
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,063
[Blank Ji and Yook Joong Wan-
Team Roxta Muzik.]

409
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:32,403
[While Employee Blank is the first
to recruit her partner...]

410
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,188
Coach, I'm heading out.

411
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,954
[Yay, it's Haroro!]

412
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:47,471
[Employee Ha is in player Sims' uniform-
Like a kid wearing his daddy's clothing...]

413
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,843
[All the other players are bursting out in
laughter over Ha Ha's fashion statement.]

414
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,395
I'm looking for a volunteer
or an applicant.

415
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:01,874
A player who's willing to participate in
an alkkaggi competition with the honor

416
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,419
of SK Knights' name on the line
in a race for victory.

417
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,775
I would like to see who would
be interested in volunteering.

418
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,654
[SK Knights' forward position,
Choi Bu Kyung.]

419
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:13,262
Why don't you step forward too?

420
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:17,034
Your hands are so large.
I was only going to choose one player...

421
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,790
But I would like to nominate
Coach Moon Kyung Eun as well.

422
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:21,194
Let's give him a huge round of applause.

423
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:23,576
I have some say in this matter as well.

424
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:27,412
We're going to play a round of
free-throw game.

425
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:31,001
[A free-throw game where the penalty
is to get snapped in the forehead.]

426
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:34,296
[Coach Moon and the players to throw
3 pointers, and Ha Ha with the free throws.]

427
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:38,787
[Coach Moon makes his attempt
at his first three pointer.]

428
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,396
- How old are you?
- 25.

429
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,960
25?
I'm 36 years old.

430
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:53,315
I'm brother,
and you're my younger brother.

431
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:55,059
[Bragging about being older while
staring way up at him.]

432
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:59,821
[He shoots...]

433
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:04,186
[And scores!]

434
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:06,834
[Choi Bu Kyung shoots from the side.]

435
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,283
Yes, that's great.

436
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,053
[I think he's going to get
smacked on the forehead.]

437
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:22,673
[Kiddo Ha attempts to make
his free-throw shot.]

438
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,774
That's going in.

439
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:32,064
[It's going in?]

440
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:36,671
[So close!
It bounces off the rim!]

441
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:40,213
He's just like you, Jung Sung Ji.

442
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:42,955
Hold still.

443
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:47,743
[A forehead smack from his childhood hero.
A resounding smack of honor.]

444
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,337
Scratch under, okay?

445
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:58,700
His smack was harder
than I expected it would be.

446
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:00,310
[Much harder than expected!]

447
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,455
I'm sorry, but this is going to hurt a lot.

448
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:05,352
I'm afraid that your neck
might snap backwards.

449
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,978
Grab onto the back of my head
so that I don't run away.

450
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,957
Grab onto the back of my neck
because I may end up running away.

451
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:20,873
[The smacking sound is enough
to echo through the court.]

452
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:23,782
[Bu Kyung's unbelievable power.]

453
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:38,092
[With the power of those fingers...
let's rule the alkkaggi competition!]

454
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:42,931
[SK Knights' Choi Bu Kyung to
represent in the alkkaggi competition.]

[One by one, they're each recruiting
their own partners for the competition...]

457

[Employee Kwang has tracked down
Woo Young and Chan Sung of 2PM.]

459

We're going to play a game to determine
who will come with me to the competition.

460
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,396
[Playing the cola-cider game to
determine who will play in the competition.]

461
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,517
[Amazing!]

462
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:20,025
[Unbelievable!
Woo Young's pebble stops on the line!]

463
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,964
That was amazing, Woo Young.

464
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:28,137
- Woo Young, are you free today?
- I'll have to check.

465
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:35,477
[I'm just kidding.
Of course, I'll come.]

466

[Employee Big-nose has yet to
recruit anyone as his partner.]

Please help me. I want to
be my company's best employee.

470

I want to become the best,
and I need AOA's help.

471
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:02,102
I want to become the best.
Thank you.

472
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:04,596
My name is Ji Suk Jin.

473

[CNBlue's Min Hyuk is also
a possible contestant.]

474
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:13,621
Kwang Soo wanted me to tell you
that he'd really love to meet you.

475
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:18,835
But I'm sorry that it's Kwang Soo.

476
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:22,431
- Are you free at all today?
- My schedule is open.

477
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,476
- Really?
- Yes, I don't have any other plans.

478
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:27,532
- Seriously? You can come with me?
- Yes, I can.

479
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:34,570
In that case, I will decide
whether it'll be Min Hyuk or Sul Hyun.

480
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,848
If it's Sul Hyun, then can it be of help
when you play against Kwang Soo?

481
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:39,145
Yes, that could be very possible.

482
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,553
- We should try for that.

[Without a doubt, it's Sul Hyun of AOA.]

486
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:04,448
- Ugh, I'm just going to play ddakjji!
- Let's play a ddakjji competition together.

487

when you're modeling?

[But...]

523
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,408
How long is it going to take for me
to be able to recruit someone?

524
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,782
Why is this taking so long?
Let's just do it like this.

525
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,021
This is all about luck.

526
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:36,995
Since I can't really choose anyone,
let's let luck decide for us.

527

- This is the last time, right?
- Yes, let's make a promise to each other.

marked with the pen wins the draw.]

to see if you have the marked piece.

or just to be on the show?

543

- I've never been on SBS before.
- Are you serious?

544

order whatever you'd like to eat.

552

- Seriously? Whatever I'd like?
- Of course.

- You seem hesitant about that.
- No, not at all.

554
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,660
Order whatever you'd like to eat.

555
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,617
Won't the cost of this meal be
just a drop in the bucket if we win?

- Should I really hit you or not.
- Don't hit me, but hit the piece.

570

I never knew that
he could be so focused like that.

571
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,227
No wonder he became an announcer
and had to quit playing sports.

572
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:35,294

What do you mean, it's small?
This is a big group of people.

613
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:23,010
It's just that they're sitting in two rows,

Kwang Soo is the best.

630

- Yes.

- You already did it?

637
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,393
Which means that three other people
voted for us!

638

Please note that we've had other people
vote for our team.

639

It's possible that six people from
other teams have voted for you.

640
00:43:01,452 --> 00:43:04,093
No, it couldn't have been six people.

641

very different from the actual reality.

642
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,922
No one can guess just who will
come out the winner of this competition.

643
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:16,267
[Team Roxta Muzik moved up to
the playoff round through an earlier game.]

644
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:28,579
The goddess of alkkaggi will be joining us
to announce the game for us.

645
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,709
Please welcome announcer, Jang Ye Won!

646
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:36,713
[The goddess of alkkaggi, Jang Ye Won.]

647
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,266
[Enters the arena with a fervent
cheering from the male crowd.]

648
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:46,740
- Wow, Jang Ye Won is no joke.
- You're on our side, aren't you?

649
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:50,637
- She didn't hesitate to take his hand.
- Hello, my name is Jang Ye Won.

650
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:52,396
It's nice to meet all of you.

651
00:43:55,564 --> 00:44:02,126
- Can you please tell us how old you are?
- I'm 25 years old.

652
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,231
- Jong Kook is eliminated!
- Why?

653
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:09,812
Kim Jong Kook is eliminated!
You're too old.

654
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,920
Without any regard to the age,
Yang Sang Kook is also eliminated!

655
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:15,651
[Yang Sang Kook is also eliminated
with no regards to his age.]

656
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:25,881
We will now get started with the first round.
Team CoKo and Team SK Knights!

657
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,363
[Big Seven's first round-
Team CoKo and Team SK Knights.]

658
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:36,396
We will now get started with the first round.

659
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,693
Jang Ye Eun will now commence
with the first round proceedings.

660
00:44:42,694 --> 00:44:45,603
We will now get started with
the alkkaggi competition.

661
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:48,552
Please give a huge round of applause.

662
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,275
[Big Seven's first round-
Yoo Jae Suk vs Ha Ha.]

663
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,526
It's tough to predict who'll win just
by seeing how they start off the game.

664
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:06,967
Just take a look at how player Ha Ha
is lining up his pieces.

665
00:45:06,968 --> 00:45:09,287
[Yoo Jae Suk's line formation
vs Ha Ha's 'W' formation.]

666
00:45:09,688 --> 00:45:13,444
[A fierce mental game
is already in the works.]

667
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,958
The way I see it, one of the pieces
will be knocked out right away.

668
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:21,925
This will be a very fierce game
of alkkaggi.

669
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,596
They will each have five pieces.

670
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,996
Ha Ha will make the first move.

671
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:32,680
- This will be an interesting game.
- Yes, I agree.

672
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:36,516
Please commence the game.

673
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,664
[Start the competition.]

674
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:45,316
[The baduk board...]

675
00:45:45,317 --> 00:45:49,180
[The unavoidable match...]

676
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:51,434
Fighting, Jae Suk!

677
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:55,617
You are all welcome to cheer for them.

678
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,912
[Yoo Hyuk starts off with a sliding move.]

679
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:06,810
He started off with a sliding move.

680
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:14,303
[Haroro responds with a scattering move.]

681
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,036
[Each showing off their own unique moves.]

682
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:19,476
Please watch carefully.
This is where it all starts.

683
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,832
Is he really going to attack?

684
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,700
[Yoo Hyuk's piece barely manages
to stop at the board's ledge.]

685
00:46:33,462 --> 00:46:35,818
[Unbelievable!]

686
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:42,192
[Haroro's chance.]

687
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:44,625
[Just the slightest tap,
and Yoo Hyuk's piece is off the board.]

688
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,660
[Please...]

689
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:57,032
[Too strong- His own piece is eliminated.]

690
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,149
[CoKo Entertainment advances
without even lifting their finger.]

691
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:05,452
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Suk- Four vs Ha Ha- Four.]

692
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,101
Is that the best Ha Ha can do?

693
00:47:10,987 --> 00:47:13,522
[Ha Ha's grave mistake.]

694
00:47:13,523 --> 00:47:16,479
It's now back to Yoo Jae Suk.

695
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,598
[Lures Ha Ha by tapping the piece.]

696
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,064
- What's 'tapping'?
- Don't you know that move?

697
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:25,680
- How many different moves are there?
- There are a total of 240 moves.

698
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:31,938
[Ha Ha looks to be getting ready for
a forward attack move.]

699
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,278
You're making me nervous!

700
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:40,999
He doesn't seem to be too sure of himself.

701
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,142
- He's not playing around right now.
- He learned his moves in Germany.

702
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:47,904
[Ha Ha studied his moves in Germany?]

703
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:51,111
If he succeeds with his attack,
then it'll put him at an advantage.

704
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:59,526
He missed very slightly with his attack.
He should've been a bit more forceful.

705
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:01,936
[Jae Suk also assumes an attack position.]

706
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:06,373
Will Yoo Jae Suk be able to
succeed this time?

707
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:10,994
[A clean successful attack.]

708
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:14,267
This puts Yoo Jae Suk's team
at an advantage.

709
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:17,707
Yoo Jae Suk!

710
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,482
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Suk- Four vs Ha Ha- Three.]

711
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:24,522
- All the black pieces are in a group.
- Black pieces aren't in a good position.

712
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:27,112
White pieces are scattered about
which puts it in an advantage.

713
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,178
When the pieces are grouped together,
it makes it tough to attack as well.

714
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:43,284
[Two pieces at once!]

715
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:52,642
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Suk- Four vs Ha Ha- One.]

716
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:56,451
That move just put CoKo Entertainment
at a great advantage.

717
00:48:56,452 --> 00:48:59,005
- But the outcome is still unknown.
- Fighting!

718
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:03,334
Ha Ha is still in the game.
He needs to knock this piece out.

719
00:49:06,037 --> 00:49:09,015
[Succeeds the attack with a perfect aim.]

720
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,844
The outcome is still unknown.

721
00:49:10,845 --> 00:49:13,486
[The game isn't over yet!]

722
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,984
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Suk- Three vs Ha Ha- One.]

723
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:19,122
But Ha Ha is still at a great disadvantage.

724
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:23,403
- This is extremely disadvantageous to Ha Ha.
- I agree.

725
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:27,541
This is similar to a game of soccer.

726
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,881
[No need to drag this out any further...]

727
00:49:29,882 --> 00:49:33,389
[I'll finish it with this one move.]

728
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,832
Remember the game when the France scored
four goals in the second half of the match?

729
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:44,722
[Jae Suk succeeds his attack and wins.]

730
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:48,537
[Final score-
Jae Suk- Two vs Ha Ha- Zero.]

731
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:55,611
[CoKo Entertainment wins the first game.]

732
00:49:55,612 --> 00:49:59,323
CoKo Entertainment wins the first round.

733
00:49:59,785 --> 00:50:02,054
The first team to win two games
will move onto the next round.

734
00:50:06,886 --> 00:50:12,838
[Big Seven Alkkaggi- Second game:
Kim Won Hyo vs Choi Bu Kyung.]

735
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,271
- That was really...
- Choi Bu Kyung, fighting!

736
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:20,899
No, cheer for Kim Won Hyo.

737
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,388
- Kim Won Hyo.
- We will now start the game.

738
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,805
What kind of a formation is this?

739
00:50:31,806 --> 00:50:34,347
[Even the formation is taken
with a serious level of concentration.]

740
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:38,867
How about putting one of the pieces
up front to make the attack easier?

741
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,344
- What kind of a formation is this?
- I would've put a piece up front.

742
00:50:42,345 --> 00:50:47,944
- It's too bad that they didn't do that.
- It's almost like a basketball positioning.

743
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,080
- You must not know much about basketball?
- That's correct, I don't know.

744
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:54,864
That's not what they do in basketball.

745
00:50:59,028 --> 00:51:01,038
[Won Hyo's cautious tap.]

746
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:03,415
What is he doing?
What is that move?

747
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,426
[Huh?]

748
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:11,003
[What is this move?]

749
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,246
[What is this?]

750
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:22,880
[A forceful sweep move!]

751
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:27,601
[A forceful power befitting
that of the size of his hand.]

752
00:51:27,602 --> 00:51:30,354
What was that move?

753
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:32,803
He only used one finger.

754
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:36,616
- Sure, we'll allow that.
- Formal name for that move, one hand sweep.

755
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:40,388
[I will sweep it all off the board.]

756
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:47,290
[The white piece is swept off the board
with one monstrous sweep.]

757
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:54,013
[An unbelievable turn!
Kim Won Hyo is easily taken down.]

758
00:51:55,222 --> 00:51:58,359
[Next game-
Yoo Jae Suk vs Choi Bu Kyung.]

759
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:05,596
[Jae Suk isn't going down without a fight!]

760
00:52:07,522 --> 00:52:09,043
Yoo Jae Suk!

761
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,432
[However...]

762
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:18,387
[The giant's advances cannot be stopped.]

763
00:52:21,043 --> 00:52:23,633
[Jae Suk ultimately ousts himself.]

764
00:52:24,213 --> 00:52:27,174
[With two wins in a row,
Team SK Knights moves onto the next round.]

765
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:29,472
Team SK Knights wins!

766
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,803
[How are we going to stop that giant?]

767
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:36,776
Team Choi Bu Kyung will move on
to the next round.

768
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:38,788
[Team SK Knights to
move on to the next round.]

769
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,682
- You're awful, Won Hyo!
- What are you doing?

770
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:46,166
[First round of Big Seven Alkkaggi-
Team SK Knights wins.]

771
00:52:53,362 --> 00:52:57,298
[Team FNC- Suk Jin and Sul Hyun.]

772
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,017
[Team ESteem- Gary and Hye Jung.]

773
00:53:01,018 --> 00:53:04,776
- Let's start the game.
- We will now start the game.

774
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:11,429
[Big Seven Alkkaggi- Round Two.
FNC's Sul Hyun vs ESteem's Hye Jung.]

775
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:21,637
Sul Hyun is in the 'M' formation,
and Hye Jung is in the 'W' formation.

776
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:24,616
They have assumed opposite formations.

777
00:53:24,617 --> 00:53:27,136
You can't lose.
You lose and it's over for us.

778
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:31,250
- Then it's the end for AOA as well.
- Suk Jin is threatening his own partner.

779
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:33,279
Why would it be the end for AOA?

780
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,923
If Sul Hyun loses this game,
then it's the end for their team.

781
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:40,303
That's a nice formation for an attack.

782
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,310
She has to win this game.

783
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:44,985
- Sul Hyun is about to make her move.
- I'm so nervous!

784
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:47,740
- Will it be a forward attack?
- She has no other choice.

785
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:50,760
She has to remain calm.

786
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:54,403
- She can't be feeling nervous.
- Do it when you're no longer nervous.

787
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,578
This move is...

788
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,671
[Bu Kyung's sweep move.]

789
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,326
[Not a bad attack for Sul Hyun.]

790
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:14,519
The closer the pieces are together,
more cautious one must remain.

791
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,199
[Controlling the force of the attack
is key in this situation.]

792
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,939
It's very easy to oust yourself
along with the opponent's piece.

793
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,704
It would be very easy
to oust herself as well.

794
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:27,007
[Team ESteem plays it safe.]

795
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:29,005
Eliminate the one you want.

796
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,637
[Using all the proper
terminology for this game.]

797
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,864
I'm just telling her to do
what she feels comfortable with.

798
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:42,146
If she wants to remain defensive too,
then she needs to start eliminating.

799
00:54:42,147 --> 00:54:46,168
Nine, eight, seven, six...

800
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:55,282
[Team ESteem's plan of defense worked!]

801
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:01,778
[Hye Jung follows it up
with a successful attack.]

802
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:08,897
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Sul Hyun- Three vs Hye Jung- Five.]

803
00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:11,416
We've already lost, so just remain calm.

804
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:15,605
- We've already lost, so just be calm.
- That's a lie, don't you think?

805
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:26,500
[Sul Hyun makes a huge mistake
in such a crucial moment!]

806
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:28,412
She's sacrificing herself for their win.

807
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,047
It can't get any worse for them right now.

808
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:35,026
- Will this be the end for them?
- She's making it easy for their win.

809
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:38,173
- All five of their pieces are still left.
- But you still don't know what'll happen.

810
00:55:38,174 --> 00:55:43,129
Since Hye Jung is at an advantage,
her moves look to be very much at ease.

811
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:46,675
Think back to when you were struggling.

812
00:55:47,454 --> 00:55:50,356
She's struggling right now as is.

813
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:52,513
Think back to your training days.

814
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:55,868
It's like her father is reprimanding her.

815
00:55:57,382 --> 00:56:00,224
Have you forgotten what took you to
get here? How can you not beat this?

816
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:06,446
[Yes, I can do this...]

817
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:11,968
[The battle isn't over yet.]

818
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:22,686
[A clean sweep of the attack!]

819
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:27,202
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Sul Hyun- Two vs Hye Jung- Four.]

820
00:56:27,203 --> 00:56:31,157
- She's showing some improvement.
- In a competition like this...

821
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:35,279
This isn't to show your experience,
but it's to showcase your skills.

822
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,464
Why are you doing that?
Why are you copying my words?

823
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:41,484
You just copied my own words!

824
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:44,368
- Wow, you're so shameless.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

825
00:56:47,096 --> 00:56:49,660
[Succeeds in two attack moves in a row.]

826
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,539
[Remaining number of pieces.
Jae Sul Hyun- Two vs Hye Jung- Three.]

827
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,877
You can't predict the end result.

828
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,448
[Sul Hyun is in the groove.]

829
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:07,365
[Sul Hyun successfully sweeps
three pieces out in a row.]

830
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:10,337
[Team FNC, fighting!]

831
00:57:10,683 --> 00:57:13,020
She's now getting used to her move.

832
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:15,889
- That's amazing.
- It truly is amazing.

833
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:24,727
[Now it's down to one on one.]

834
00:57:24,728 --> 00:57:27,791
[Team ESteem is now on the defense.]

835
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:30,621
- The outcome is unknown!
- It's down to this one last move!

836
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,929
- It's down to this move!
- She needs to be more aggressive!

837
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,945
- She needs to be more aggressive!
- She is being told to eliminate Sul Hyun.

838
00:57:45,502 --> 00:57:48,429
[How can this be...]

839
00:57:49,493 --> 00:57:53,073
[Sul Hyun's complete game changer!]

840
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:58,480
[Big Seven Alkkaggi- Game Two.
FNC:1 vs Esteem 1.]

841
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:03,243
It's a miraculous win for Team FNC!

842
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,105
It's okay.

843
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:09,500
AOA's Sul Hyun saves her team
from the danger of elimination!

844
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:17,419
[Big Seven Alkkaggi-
FNC's Suk Jin vs ESteem's Gary.]

845
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,039
Are you finished?

846
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:24,225
Jang Ye Won isn't normally like that.

847
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,548
Big-nose is starting to listen to
Coach Sul Hyun's instructions.

848
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:37,277
Sul Hyun, Hye Jung and
Ye Won are all so beautiful.

849
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,323
They're all such beauties.

850
00:58:39,324 --> 00:58:42,889
Suk Jin and Gary are making the beauties
look even more beautiful in comparison.

851
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:49,598
[You ladies are like roses,
and we are like babies breath.]

852
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,386
And Yook Joong Wan is supporting
my statement as well.

853
00:58:52,387 --> 00:58:55,048
Yes, he is fiercely supporting
your statement.

854
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,843
Ji Hyo looks even more beautiful
than usual.

855
00:58:56,844 --> 00:59:00,291
Actually, his company as a whole is
making Ji Hyo look so much more beautiful.

856
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:03,684
[Roxta Muzik will do whatever we can to
make your beauty shine even more brightly.]

857
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:07,897
[Team ESteem Gary's attack.]

858
00:59:07,898 --> 00:59:10,748
This game really grabs your attention.

859
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:15,678
[A precise and powerful attack.]

860
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:20,976
Gary is one hundred percent in his zone.

861
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:24,598
Gary really enjoys shooting pool
in his spare time.

862
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,890
Yes, that could be helpful in this game.

863
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,249
Suk Jin is really good at bluffing.

864
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:38,516
[Ah...]

865
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,526
Maybe my statement had an effect?
Did my statement influence the outcome?

866
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:50,342
- Is he about to reveal a new move?
- What is Ji Suk Jin doing?

867
00:59:50,343 --> 00:59:53,120
Ji Suk Jin is showing a new move.

868
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:56,253
[Succeeds in the one finger sweep attack.]

869
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:59,383
[Big-nose successfully attacks
Gary's piece with the sweep.]

870
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:04,783
Ji Suk Jin and Gary both usually
attacks with the thumb flick.

871
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:08,166
- Can he get it done?
- Let's see if he can eliminate the piece.

872
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:11,517
[Gary successfully eliminates
another piece!]

873
01:00:11,518 --> 01:00:14,078
Gary is one hundred percent in the zone!

874
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,264
Yes, he is very much in the zone.

875
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:19,642
It's absolutely unbelievable.

876
01:00:19,643 --> 01:00:23,192
Three, two, one!

877
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:27,479
[I won't let you win! Big-nose
eliminates before the buzzer sounds!]

01:00:27,822 --> 01:00:31,390
[A very tight competition.]

880
01:00:40,881 --> 01:00:45,449
[Gary is a professional alkkaggi player!]

881
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,645
- He is one hundred percent in the zone!
- He is truly unbelievable.

882
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:49,919
Sul Hyun, forgive me if I lose.

883
01:00:51,222 --> 01:00:54,008
[Why are you apologizing now?]

884
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:55,925
Maybe it would've been better for
Sul Hyun to play this game too.

885
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:07,832
[Big Seven Alkkaggi- Game Two.
Team ESteem wins!]

886
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,233
I'm sorry.

887
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:12,744
Team ESteem will move up to semi-finals!

888
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,011
[Gary and Lee Hye Jung-
Team ESteem into the semi-finals!]

889
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,285
They're very focused about their formation.

890
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,731
[Round three-
JYP's Woo Young vs SBS' Kim Jong Kook.]

891
01:01:31,732 --> 01:01:34,742
[The winner of this game will move on
to the semi-finals round.]

892
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:36,398
[Woo Young's pinky attack.]

893
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:38,982
This is Woo Young's promise finger move.

894
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,786
Don't you think that your names
for these moves are too much?

895
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,293
Maybe you should be more selective
about the words you choose to use.

896
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:50,097
I hope that Ms. Ok Joo Hyun doesn't
take offense to your comments.

897
01:01:50,098 --> 01:01:53,082
[Ok Joo Hyun move to Pinky promise move?]

898
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,466
[Woo Young is feeding off the
'Pinky promise move' statements.]

899
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:04,592
[Wow, two pieces with one flick!]

[Team JYP moves onto the semi-finals.]

902
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,797
We will now immediately  move
onto the semi-finals round.

903
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:23,510
[Big Seven alkkaggi competition-
Semi-finals.]

904
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:30,312
- It is the semi-finals round.
- Yes, that's correct.

905
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,728
It's Choi Bu Kyung vs Gary!

906

[First round of semi-finals:
Choi Bu Kyung vs Gary.]

907
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:40,807
[The strong vs The strong!
A formidable match!]

908
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:44,128
I know this since I've competed
against Kang Gary myself.

909
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:50,594
As you all already know,
Gary has been 100% accurate.

910
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:53,951
Choi Bu Kyung on the other hand is
the pioneer of the sweeping moves.

911
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:58,318
- It's in a straight line formation.
- It's a push move.

912
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,622
No, don't do that!
That's way too aggressive.

913
01:03:04,642 --> 01:03:07,802
He's moving the pieces back further
hopping that Gary will make a mistake.

914
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:10,697
We'll see who will make
the first aggressive attack.

915
01:03:10,698 --> 01:03:13,043
I know from first hand
that he is very highly skilled.

916
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:19,927
[Perfect aim!]

917
01:03:20,353 --> 01:03:25,557
[Random Mr. Capable is drawing
a loud cheer from the crowd.]

918
01:03:25,558 --> 01:03:30,021
- The crowd can't help but cheer for him.
- He can be a national representatives.

919
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:33,611
[Choi Bu Kyung's sweep move.]

920
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:42,956
[He loses his own piece as well
in the process!]

921
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,998
He still boasts a 100%
success rate.

922
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:56,461
[Zero mistakes!]

923
01:04:01,532 --> 01:04:03,816
Kang Gary!

924
01:04:03,817 --> 01:04:07,169
- Wow, he really is remarkable.
- Amazing!

925
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:10,004
I wonder if he's aware of just how good
he is at the game himself.

926
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:12,597
[Choi Bu Kyung succeeds.]

927
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:17,999
[Remaining number of pieces.
Choi Bu Kyung- Two vs Gary- Three.]

928
01:04:18,918 --> 01:04:21,002
This truly is a great game.

929
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:28,709
[Player Gae unfortunately loses
his own piece as well in the process.]

930
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:32,817
Choi Bu Kyung must successfully
eliminate one of the black pieces.

931
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:35,213
If he doesn't,
then Team SK Knights will be in danger.

932
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,997
Just lightly tap it.

933
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,919
[Chooses to go with a defensive move.]

934
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,035
In my opinion, I think an
attack would've been a better move.

935
01:04:45,036 --> 01:04:47,680
If he fails his attack...

936
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:52,824
[How can this be!]

937
01:04:52,825 --> 01:04:57,029
[Precise Gary's missed shot!]

938
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,568
[He seems to be on edge from having
to compete against Choi Bu Kyung.]

939
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:05,035
That could've been a detrimental mistake.

940
01:05:07,368 --> 01:05:11,226
[Trying to lure Gary into another attack,
Choi Bu Kyung makes another defensive move.]

941
01:05:13,689 --> 01:05:16,604
[Only one piece left for both players.]

942
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:19,155
- This could be the move.
- Will he be able to get it done?

943
01:05:19,156 --> 01:05:22,897
[Will he be able to make
a successful attack?]

944
01:05:22,898 --> 01:05:24,488
He's getting ready to make his attack.

945
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:29,859
[Another missed shot!]

[SK Knights moves onto the finals
in the Big Seven Alkkaggi Competition!]

950
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,739
[Second semi-finals game.]

951
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,389
Please welcome Song Ji Hyo
and Yook Joong Wan!

952
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,229
[Roxta Muzik finally
makes their entrance!]

953
01:05:58,189 --> 01:06:01,824
[Team JYP is their opposing team.]

954
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:07,771
It's Lee Kwang Soo and Yoo Young
vs Song Ji Hyo and Yook Joong Wan.

955
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:11,805
How Yook Joong Wan-like of him.

956
01:06:11,806 --> 01:06:15,395
- That's very like him.
- Very befitting of his own name.

Jang Woo Young!
Jang Woo Young!

960

Jang Woo Young!
Sorry, but you're not our style.

961
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:34,185
[Attack on the opponent under
the disguise of it being a cheer.]

962
01:06:34,186 --> 01:06:38,084
- Yes, this is great.

963
01:06:39,057 --> 01:06:44,324

01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:47,294
[Yook Joong Wan's mountain formation.]

965
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:50,904
- What is this?
- What kind of a formation is that?

966
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,151
What is this?

967
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:55,198
[Woo Young's unbalanced formation.]

968
01:06:55,714 --> 01:06:58,343
What kind of an obscure
alkkaggi move is that?

969
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:02,072
- What is he doing?
- I have no idea what that is.

970
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:05,030
[Right from the formation,
this is a very unusual game.]

971
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:10,203
[Joong Wan's skills are still unknown.]

972
01:07:10,204 --> 01:07:13,295
Yook Joong Wan's first move.

973
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:17,711
[First move will show
the level of his skillset.]

974
01:07:24,702 --> 01:07:27,033
It almost became two birds with one stone!

975
01:07:27,034 --> 01:07:29,474
[Skillset befitting of being
moved up to the semi-finals.]

976
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:33,443
- It could've been two with one move.
- His impressive skills are unveiled.

977
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:38,513
Yook Joong Wan showed some impressive
skills during the earlier game as well.

978
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:41,065
One of the white pieces
are hanging on the ledge.

979
01:07:47,983 --> 01:07:51,818
[Idol, Woo Young, shows impressive
targeting and shooting skills.]

980
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:53,545
Yes, he is very good.

981
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:56,537
- Yes, that was very good.
- Impressive skills.

982
01:07:57,732 --> 01:08:02,191
Yook Joong Wan seems to favor
the sweeping move.

983
01:08:08,927 --> 01:08:10,872
No, it's okay.

984
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,946
- It's okay.
- Three white and three black pieces left.

985
01:08:13,947 --> 01:08:18,697
The important thing to realize is that
even though the white piece is on the ledge

986
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:21,471
that position could actually prove to be
advantageous in the end.

987
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:25,055
Yes, it can definitely lure in the enemy.

988
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:28,788
- What, 'the enemy'?
- This isn't a war.

989
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:31,774
What kind of a term is that?
How is he the enemy?

990
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,842
- It means to lure in the opponent.
- Go easy with your comments.

991
01:08:37,878 --> 01:08:39,810
Your skills are really lacking
compared to theirs.

992
01:08:39,811 --> 01:08:42,886
[Quiet hackling from the back.]

993
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:49,511
[The seriousness of the move can be felt
through his fingertip.]

994
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,801
[Unfortunately misses ousting
both pieces with one shot!]

995
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:04,834
[A fierce competition befitting
of the semi-finals round.]

996
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:08,609
This is very nerve-wrecking,
and very aggressive attacks.

997
01:09:10,707 --> 01:09:12,730
[Tries to lure Woo Young into attacking.]

998
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,301
Yes, that move wasn't actually half bad.

999
01:09:14,302 --> 01:09:16,650
If we had to compare
Joong Wan to a soccer player

1000
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:18,574
then he'd resemble Rooney very closely.

1001
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:21,240
Yes, Rooney of Manchester.

1002
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:26,049
- They each have two pieces left.
- Will it be an attack or defense?

1003
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:32,281
- The positioning is very important.
- Which of the two will he do?

1004
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:34,004
It looks as though he's on the defense.

1005
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:36,131
[Defense?]

1006
01:09:36,132 --> 01:09:38,608
[A very successful attack!]

1007
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:43,007
[TKO!]

1008
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:48,086
[Please give me your strength!]

1009
01:09:48,087 --> 01:09:51,125
He has the quickest speed
of everyone else I've seen.

1010
01:09:51,126 --> 01:09:53,039
[Ceremonial dance.]

1011
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:56,247
The speed he puts into his moves
are the quickest I've seen.

1012
01:09:56,248 --> 01:10:02,333
Even though I haven't measured it,
his speed is at about 130km.

1013
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:05,396
[Piece speed racer.]

1014
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:09,881
Yes, the speed of how he attacks
could be very important.

1015
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:14,644
[Yook Joong Wan is down to his final piece.]

1016
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:19,037
You can't predict what he can do
with his one final piece.

1017
01:10:19,038 --> 01:10:20,583
[Succeeds the attack.]

1018
01:10:22,028 --> 01:10:25,177
[Yook Joong Wan's
responsive ceremonial dance.]

1019
01:10:28,287 --> 01:10:31,388
This is a very skilled competition.

1020
01:10:31,389 --> 01:10:34,089
- This is a highly skilled competition.
- Yes, the best we've seen so far.

1021
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:38,034
- That's a very difficult position.
- Jang Woo Young!

1022
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:45,989
[Speed racer butts his white piece
right up against the black piece.]

1023
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,235
This is a very skilled move.

1024
01:10:48,236 --> 01:10:54,125
Being too close to the opponent's piece
could actually be even more difficult.

1025
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:57,260
Yes, you can never guess
what could result.

1026
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:59,458
[His explanations needs a rest.]

1027
01:10:59,459 --> 01:11:01,348
Move out of that spot.

1028
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:08,402
[Yook Joong body checks Woo Young
to take his spot.]

1029
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:12,643
- Woo Young just got pushed out of his spot.
- Yook Joong Wan body checked him.

1030
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,970
He shows strength when it comes to
bodily moves.

1031
01:11:16,952 --> 01:11:20,592
[A worrisome distance and moves.]

1032
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:22,889
Will he succeed or terminate himself?

1033
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:28,999
[Too close of a distance is proving
difficult for elimination.]

1034
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,806
[This is my chance.]

1035
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:35,460
That could've been a detrimental mistake.

1036
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:40,052
- This could be his chance.
- Woo Young and his lightning speed.

1037
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:42,702
This could be the final attack.

1038
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:47,801
What is that sound?

1039
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:51,405
[Player Yook starts to chant.]

1040
01:11:51,406 --> 01:11:53,277
Yes, that is allowed.

1041
01:11:53,278 --> 01:11:56,618
[Starts to chant to fluster his opponent.]

1042
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,311
[All his friends runs over
to join in on his chant.]

1043
01:12:02,253 --> 01:12:06,981
[Please...
we pray for you to make a mistake.]

1044
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:12,738
[A group chant and prayer.]

1045
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:21,130
It's almost like a chanting of a spell.

1046
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:26,025
[Please miss... please miss...]

1047
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:30,890
[Player Yook is praying for
Woo Young to make a mistake.]

1048
01:12:30,891 --> 01:12:34,891
'Please miss?'

1049
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,502
[First time anyone has ever chanted
a spell during an alkkaggi game.]

1050
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:40,990
No, don't listen to him!

1051
01:12:40,991 --> 01:12:43,296
Just do it!

1052
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:46,774
You need to stay focused!
Stay focused!

1053
01:12:46,775 --> 01:12:48,564
It's okay, you can do it.

1054
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,124
[Everyone's caught up in the chanting.]

1055
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:57,182
Will our Speed Racer be able to succeed?

1056
01:12:57,183 --> 01:13:02,657
Speed is very important,
but precision is just as important.

1057
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:06,118
- Will he make it?
- Put your life on the line.

1058
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,676
[This is one very serious game!]

1059
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:15,888
Okay, he bets his life on the line.

1060
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:18,725
This move will determine whether
he lives or dies.

1061
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:23,656
[The fierce look of determination-
Scanning of the board now complete.]

1062
01:13:30,944 --> 01:13:33,941
[It's a tie!]

1063
01:13:37,715 --> 01:13:44,358
[Ji Hyo vs Kwang Soo.
This game will determine the winner.]

1064
01:13:48,839 --> 01:13:52,705
- What a fierce competition!
- We're in love with Song Ji Hyo!

1065
01:13:54,049 --> 01:13:56,646
[What great atmosphere!]

1066
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:58,862
Thinking of you, Kwang Soo!

1067
01:14:00,162 --> 01:14:02,091
What are you talking about?

1068
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:05,282
Lee Kwang Soo is very well known for
his streak of misfortune.

1069
01:14:05,283 --> 01:14:06,981
- He's the icon of betrayal, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

1070
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:10,679
When he was deep into his traitorous days,
he said he'd betray even his own parents.

1071
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,340
[Kwang Soo moves out of his seat
right from the start?]

1072
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:21,406
- Why do you think he's doing that?
- Do you really need to do that?

1073
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,878
[The ease of knowing that
they're already in the finals.]

1074
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:26,227
You are such a dirty player.

1075
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:32,140
[Giraffe moves over to the opposite side.]

1076
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,756
No, he can't do it.
I can almost guarantee that he'll fail.

1077
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:44,397
We can safely assume that he
can't do it.

1078
01:14:46,223 --> 01:14:48,410
[Blank Ji's attack.]

1079
01:14:49,911 --> 01:14:52,900
[Attempting to squeeze in between
her own pieces.]

1080
01:14:53,444 --> 01:14:55,998
[A difficult move
due to the very narrow space.]

1081
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:58,240
- Concentrate!
- She's going for it.

1082
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:01,329
She could very well oust herself
in the process.

1083
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:06,159
[She does it!]

1084
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,274
She's better than most men.

1085
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:11,426
[An ace at anything that she does!]

1086
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:15,289
- There's nothing she can't do.
- Can she win this?

1087
01:15:23,147 --> 01:15:26,118
[Grazes Ji Hyo's piece,
but ultimately ousts himself.]

1088
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:32,819
He's losing out in every single category.

1089
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,414
[Remaining number of pieces-
Ji Hyo- Four vs Kwang Soo- Three.]

1090
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:47,539
[Precise aim and strength.]

1091
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,890
Yes, it's all about the sweep
when it comes to alkkaggi.

1092
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:56,486
Now that the competition is getting fierce,
Team JYP is starting to look grim.

1093
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,634
[Fighting, Giraffe.]

1094
01:15:58,635 --> 01:16:01,871
Lee Kwang Soo is also attempting
to make the sweeping move.

1095
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:03,593
[Giraffe gets his finger in position.]

1096
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:06,920
This is his chance to show off his skills.

1097
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:10,502
He eliminates his own piece!

1098
01:16:10,503 --> 01:16:13,639
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

1099
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,430
[This is the first time that an opposing team
has shown a sign of gratefulness.]

1100
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:18,228
Sum Mi is actually pouting right now.

1101
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:23,423
- As mentioned before, he has no chance.
- No, he really is awful.

1102
01:16:23,424 --> 01:16:26,481
[Remaining number of pieces-
Ji Hyo- Four vs Kwang Soo- One.]

1103
01:16:28,987 --> 01:16:31,085
I hope that she'll show us something
grand for this one final move.

1104
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,991
The final move by Ji Hyo!

1105
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:36,737
[Ace's clean finish!]

1106
01:16:37,915 --> 01:16:43,695
[Song Ji Hyo and Yook Joong Wan
move onto the final round.]

1107
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:49,664
[I'm sorry for losing...]

1108
01:16:49,665 --> 01:16:52,885
A female player wins the game!

1109
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:58,899
It's the final round!
Ha Ha and Choi Bu Kyung...

1110
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,290
vs Song Ji Hyo and Yoo Joong Wan!

1111
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:05,061
[Big Seven Alkkaggi Competition-
The final competition!]

1112
01:17:05,062 --> 01:17:09,539
[Song Ji Hyo and Yook Joong Wan
vs Ha Ha and Choi Bu Kyung.]

1113
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:14,236
[Only one final round
to determine the victor.]

1114
01:17:14,237 --> 01:17:18,213
[The key is to choose the right player
to lead the team into victory.]

1115
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:21,267
For this final round,
we will be playing with seven pieces.

1116
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,995
Players may now enter the arena.

1117
01:17:24,996 --> 01:17:27,649
[Time for the players to enter.]

1118
01:17:31,622 --> 01:17:34,574
[Yook Joong Wan for Team Rock stars.]

1119
01:17:34,575 --> 01:17:37,942
[vs Choi Bu Kyung of SK Knights.]

1120
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:42,638
[Face-off between two strongest players.]

1121
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:48,809
[Will it be the pioneer of the sweep move,
Choi Bu Kyung...]

1122
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:51,838
[Or the pupil of the sweep move,
Yook Joong Wan.]

1123
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:59,381
[Eliminate the anxiety...]

1124
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,132
Look at how many new fans of
alkkaggi we're gaining.

1125
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:06,994
[Time to assume the formation.]

1126
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:09,845
- Are you finished with the formation?
- The formations are very similar.

1127
01:18:10,781 --> 01:18:15,297
- It's a very safe looking formation.
- Maybe push it towards the edge a bit.

1128
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:19,246
[Joong Wan to make the first move.]

1129
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:22,942
[Plans to eliminate two pieces
with his first shot.]

1130
01:18:23,425 --> 01:18:28,979
[Even though he misses eliminating two,
he succeeds in eliminating one.]

1131
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:35,023
[Bu Kyung's turn to make a sweep attack.]

1132
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:36,523
Sweep it off the board!

1133
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:43,326
[A clean sweep.]

1134
01:18:43,327 --> 01:18:46,052
This leaves the black piece with a chance
to eliminate two whites pieces at once.

1135
01:18:48,152 --> 01:18:49,843
Is he not going for that?

1136
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,972
[Succeeds the attack.]

1137
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:54,902
It's a very clean game, isn't it?

1138
01:18:56,843 --> 01:18:58,899
[The target piece.]

1139
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:03,665
[Perfect aim, but too weak of a shot.]

1140
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:08,531
[Now it's back to Yook Joong Wan.]

1141
01:19:09,326 --> 01:19:14,344
[Follows it up... and ousts his own piece.]

1142
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:20,554
[Remaining number of pieces-
Joong Wan- Five vs Bu Kyung- Four.]

1143
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:25,624
[Time for Choi Bu Kyung to turn the tide.]

1144
01:19:36,768 --> 01:19:41,273
[Remaining number of pieces-
Joong Wan- Four vs Bu Kyung- Four.]

1145
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:43,022
Any mistakes can be deadly.

1146
01:19:43,023 --> 01:19:47,027
[Team Roxta is back in the lead.]

1147
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:55,132
Yes, he needs to hit it
a little off to the left.

1148
01:19:55,133 --> 01:19:56,835
[A chance to eliminate two pieces at once.]

1149
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:03,414
[But he fortunately succeeds in
eliminating one of the pieces.]

1150
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:07,971
[Joong Wan switches his position.]

1151
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:14,822
[Choi Bu Kyung follows along
to run interference to Joong Wan.]

1152
01:20:16,068 --> 01:20:19,078
[Basketball player's alkkaggi defense moves.]

1153
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:26,080
- It's down to the physical blocks.
- Joong Wan isn't easy to block physically.

1154
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:29,011
He's screening Joong Wan
just like a basketball player would.

1155
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:38,395
[Joong Wan overcomes the block
and succeeds in his attack.]

1156
01:20:38,396 --> 01:20:41,978
[Remaining number of pieces-
Joong Wan- Three vs Bu Kyung- Two.]

1157
01:20:42,962 --> 01:20:46,203
- This isn't an easy position to attack.
- What kind of a move will he make?

1158
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:49,483
[A move that he enjoyed making
during the semi-finals round.]

1159
01:20:49,484 --> 01:20:51,844
- He had fun with those moves earlier.
- I don't know what to do here.

1160
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:55,847
- This is an easy time to make mistakes.
- Joong Wan needs to be cautious.

1161
01:20:57,694 --> 01:21:01,200
If he's able to eliminate both with one move,
then it'll be a game changer.

1162
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:04,136
[Attempting a two in one move.]

1163
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:07,684
[If he succeeds,
then he'll turn the game around.]

1164
01:21:13,854 --> 01:21:16,673
[Ousts one piece!]

1165
01:21:18,566 --> 01:21:21,735
[Very closely misses ousting both pieces!]

1166
01:21:21,736 --> 01:21:24,360
- He's so good!
- That was so close!

1167
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:28,815
[A single mistake can turn into defeat.]

1168
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:34,666
[Yook Joong Wan successfully attacks.]

1169
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:38,363
It could be down to this one final move!

1170
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:42,736
[A serious playoff game!]

1171
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:50,238
- Choi Bu Kyung, fighting!
- If he misses, then it could be the end!

1172
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,301
This could determine
whether the game will end or go on.

1173
01:21:53,302 --> 01:21:56,052
They're betting on Choi Bu Kyung right now.

1174
01:21:57,624 --> 01:22:00,447
I can start to see the end.

1175
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,095
[Fails! A soft shot
in fear of self destruction.]

1176
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:10,864
[Remaining number of pieces-
Joong Wan- Two vs Bu Kyung- One.]

1177
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:14,855
If Yook Joong Wan succeeds,
then that's the end of the battle.

1178
01:22:14,856 --> 01:22:19,878
[Success of this attack would
mean their victory!]

1179
01:22:21,057 --> 01:22:25,886
[Will this attack mean their victory?]

1180
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:30,217
This really could be the final attack.

1181
01:22:30,218 --> 01:22:32,286
[Complete focus.]

1182
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:43,492
[Everything is riding on this one attack.]

1183
01:22:43,493 --> 01:22:45,330
Song Ji Hyo really is amazing.

1184
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:48,475
Okay, he's about to make his move.

1185
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,433
[Putting all his energy into this one sweep.]

1186
01:22:56,361 --> 01:23:01,759
[If he fails at this attack...
then the other team still has a chance.]

1187
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,815
[Succeeds in his attack!]

1188
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:17,886
[Team Roxta wins
the Big Seven Competition!]

1189
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:19,645
Song Ji Hyo and Yook Joong Wan wins!

01:23:20,618 --> 01:23:27,421

and their crowd of fans wins the game!]

1191
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:31,382
[Team SK Knights comes in at second place.]

1192
01:23:31,383 --> 01:23:34,281
- You guys were amazing.
- I can't believe we won!

1193
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:42,288
[A huge round of applause to
all the teams.]

1194
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:47,046
Ye Won will now present a prize
to the winning team.

1195
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:53,811
[A prize for the winning team.]

1196
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:59,826
Who guessed that this team
would win the competition?

1197
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:05,821
[FNC's Juniel get a prize for predicting
the win for this team.]

1198
01:24:05,822 --> 01:24:07,757
Who else?
Please step forward.

1199
01:24:09,073 --> 01:24:12,183
[Two people from Team ESteem.]

1200
01:24:14,851 --> 01:24:16,985
No one from this team?

1201
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,557
[We had no idea that they'd win...]

1202
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:24,997
[Only one member from their team
predicted the win.]

1203
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:30,227
[A gold bar to the seven people
who guessed correctly.]

1204
01:24:30,228 --> 01:24:32,556
Let's check and see what the prize
for the winning team is.

1205
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:34,766
[Time to reveal the prize.]

1206
01:24:36,467 --> 01:24:40,677
[A baduk board.]

1207
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:45,346
So that you can play this game at home.

1208
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:50,558
That's why you're getting this prize,
and congratulations again for winning!
