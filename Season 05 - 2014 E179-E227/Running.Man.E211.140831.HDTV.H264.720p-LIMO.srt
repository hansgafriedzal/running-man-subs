You used to be the youngest of the bunch.

166
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,828
<i>Kang Gary's over here!</i>

167
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,487
Where's my partner?

168
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,479
Where's my partner hiding?

169
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,993
Guest?

170
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,583
My guest for the day?

171
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,175
What the heck?
Skull!

172
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:49,687
- Skull!
- It's you, isn't it?

173
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,966
[Ha Ha's partner is found.]

174
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,363
Come on, let's go.
We need to find the 'R' flag.

175
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:57,549
[Top reggae artist in the country- Skull.]

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,078
- Come on, we need the 'R' flag.
- You're my partner? We have the same shirts.

177
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,289
We have to find the 'R' flag.
We don't have much time.

178
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,738
I can't believe that I'm on Running Man
when I'm horrible at running.

179
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,989
- We need to find the 'R' flag.
- Green!

180
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,525
- Green!
- Why are you two together?

181
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,935
- Green!
- Over here!

182
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:17,855
Over here!

183
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,845
Oh my goodness!
Green!

184
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Hurry!
Over here!

185
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,310
Who is it?

186
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,903
- Gary!
- Ailee!

187
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:33,471
[Soul Diva- Ailee.]

188
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:37,179
- Ailee! We need to find the flag.
- Gary, we need to get to the flag.

189
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,952
[On the search for the flag
without any hesitation.]

190
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,025
- It's Ailee.
- Hello.

191
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,167
- Are you two a team?
- Yes, we're a team.

192
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:47,449
- We need to find the flag.
- We haven't even greeted each other yet.

193
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,661
- All we're doing is running right now.
- It's been a while.

194
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,623
Wait, let's check over here.
Here it is!

195
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,881
I found it!

196
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:59,883
[Ha Ha and Skull arrives at the 'R' flag.]

197
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:02,442
- I think we went over our time limit.
- No, we haven't gone over the limit.

198
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,938
You went over by 42 seconds.

199
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,826
[Ha Ha and Skull fail.]

200
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,140
He has waited for four years
to come out on our show.

201
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:13,960
Can you please give him a break?

202
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:17,742
- Here it is, Ailee.
- Seriously?

203
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,486
Here it is.

204
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:22,099
[Eight minutes- Gary and Ailee fail.]

205
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,442
Do you have any idea
how big this amusement park is?

206
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:28,510
Who's my partner!
I think I see someone.

207
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,378
I think I found my partner.
Hey!

208
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,852
- I'm not doing it! I'm going home!
- Who is it?

209
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,439
- Song Eun! Come here!
- I'm not doing it!

210
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,463
[For the first time in the show's history,
a guest refuses a member.]

211
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:44,095
[The little giant of the comedic world-
Song Eun Yi.]

212
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:47,366
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi fail.]

213
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:51,281
Did you do your hair?
Why did you do your hair?

214
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:53,445
It's the singer's style.

215
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,449
- I'm glad that you're my partner.
- Ugh, seriously!

216
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,689
I feel very comfortable.

217
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,774
I think two minutes...
two minutes isn't enough.

218
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:14,974
Kwang Soo and I did a drama
together a few years ago.

219
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,616
Kim Jong Kook?

220
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,312
He and I went to the same middle school
and high school together.

221
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,856
Yes, we did.

222
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:26,721
I won't make you wait too long.

223
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,331
I think I smell her scent.

224
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,449
Her scent is wafting towards me.

225
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,471
Wait, there's my partner!

226
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:36,310
- What the heck?
- Kwang Soo!

227
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:41,813
[Kwang Soo and Chang Wook
are reunited.]

228
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:43,430
Where do we go now?

229
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,682
- What's an 'R' flag?
- A flag with the 'R' mark on it.

230
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,674
Wait!
We have to find the 'R' flag!

231
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,835
- 'R' flag!
- Wait, you have to wait for me.

232
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:55,265
[Where's the 'R' flag?]

233
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:57,444
Where's the 'R' flag?
I don't think it's here.

234
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,830
I didn't know that you were
my partner.

235
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:03,311
- Did you grow even taller?
- I thought that you were going to be a girl.

236
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,760
Why are we doing this all the way
in Gwangju?

237
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:10,055
We have to find a flag
that has the 'R' mark on it.

238
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,984
- An egg? ('R' sounds like an 'egg')
- No, the letter, 'R'.

239
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:13,483
There it is!

240
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:15,717
- There it is over there.
- Where?

241
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,749
[Kwang Soo and Chang Wook
finally find the 'R' flag.]

242
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,341
[Ah... 'R'?]

243
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,233
- Did you think that it was an egg?
- Yes.

244
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,749
- This is it?
- You've been looking for an egg?

245
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,013
Yes, an egg. Because I
thought you said, 'egg flag.'

246
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,798
I passed by this spot
a couple of times already.

247
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,188
[Kwang Soo and Chang Wook
completely fail.]

248
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,079
I heard that you chose the number two?

249
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,240
I liked the number two.

250
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,375
[What is the deal with this guy?]

251
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:46,833
- You didn't know it was me, right?
- Okay, here's your real mission.

252
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,217
[Time for the real mission.]

253
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,205
Here we go again.

254
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,047
What is it?

255
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,349
- 1470?
- What is this?

256
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:00,199
- What does '1470' mean?
- 1470?

257
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,751
- 1470?
- 1470?

258
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,623
<i>1470.</i>

259
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:17,539
[The mysterious number... 1470...]

260
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,901
This is a numbers race.

261
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:22,884
<i>You will earn a variety of numbers by playing
several different missions today.</i>

262
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,783
<i>Through the usage of the numbers you
earn, and different numeric symbols</i>

263
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:31,648
<i>you have to turn the number, 1470,
into the number, zero.</i>

264

[Rule- Turn the number, 1470,
into the number, zero.]

265
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,171
<i>You have to turn it into a zero.</i>

266
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:38,497
What does that mean?

267
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:42,756
They're going to give us different symbols
such as 'divide', 'add', 'subtract'.

268
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,383
So we have to use those symbols to
turn '1470' into a zero.

269
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,079
- What did you say? Explain it again.
- Think about it.

270
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,309
[Frustrated]

271
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,160
[I have no idea what you're
talking about...]

272
00:14:57,161 --> 00:15:00,277
- So you have to either subtract or add.
- Ah! So we're going to get these numbers?

273
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,459
<i>You may earn these numbers if you
were to pass your missions</i>

274
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,673
<i>or you may end up finding them too.</i>

275
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:07,845
- This can get very complicated.
- I'm not good with numbers.

276
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:11,187
This can get extremely complicated.
We have to find the multiplication sign.

277
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:14,835
<i>If you aren't able to turn the number
into a zero as you are told to do...</i>

278
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:19,239
<i>then you will receive an extremely difficult
punishment, which will go into tomorrow.</i>

279
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,747
[Unfathomable portions of...]

- I'm really bad with numbers.
- I'm bad with them too.

282
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,234
What do we do?

283
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,242
So we have to subtract, add, or divide
to come up with that zero?

284
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,312
- I'm an engineering student.
- Seriously?

285
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:43,470
Jong Kook, don't even worry about it.
I'm really good at math.

286
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,178
- I'm amazing with arithmetic.
- Are you lying? Seriously?

287
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,523
- I'm really good with math.
- That is totally unexpected.

288
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:53,280
Don't you remember that I was
always the brains of g.o.d?

289

here's your first mathematical sign.</i>

[A 'minus' sign is given out to the teams
that succeeded the guest mission.]

291
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,461
It's a plus?

[A 'plus' sign is given out to the teams
that failed the guest mission.]

293
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,173
[The 'minus' sign is extremely advantageous
in succeeding the ultimate mission.]

294
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,040
This is an 'R'?

295
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,581
[The sign is on the back...]

296
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,859
Who is this guy?

297
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,609
He's making me nervous.
Are you being like this on purpose?

298
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,269
- No, I'm going to do my best.
- Yes, you have to.

299
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,961
Ah, so we have to either multiply,
divide, or something like that?

300
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,498
[A deep sigh...]

301
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,179
If we had a multiplication sign with
a zero, then it would be game over.

302
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,014
Aren't I so clever?

303
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,436
He's gotten pretty smart.

304
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,787
It's a 'plus' sign.

305
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:50,062
[Kwang Soo and Chang Woo get the 'plus'
sign for having failed the guest mission.]

306
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:53,400
But I just told you...
we just need a 'times zero' sign.

307
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,509
- We get that sign, and it's game over.
- Okay.

308
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:58,003
<i>We would've given you the 'minus' sign
if you had succeeded</i>

309
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,819
<i>but you got the 'plus' sign
because you failed the mission.</i>

310
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,032
[What is she talking about?]

311
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:08,649
- It's because we failed the mission.
- Ah... so we have to win something?

312
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,489
He's really bad at
understanding things, isn't he?

313
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,940
<i>You can just explain it
to him yourself, okay?</i>

314
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,681
I've never been in this situation before.

315
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:21,235
I feel like I've become the teacher here.

316

[For the first time ever on the show,
Kwang Soo seems smarter than the guest.]

317

Okay, we will now start
with your first mission.

318
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,595
- Okay, what is it?
- It's the wooden roller coaster behind you.

[Are you kidding me right now?]

325
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,446

quite a challenge for me.

expert is full of anticipation.]

327
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,756
- Here's your first mission.
- My stomach is starting to cramp up.

328
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:18,690
<i>Your mission is, 'Wow, it's a celebrity.'</i>

329
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,321
<i>As the two of you enjoy your ride
on the rollercoaster</i>

330
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:26,660
<i>you will notice that we have attached several
pictures of various actresses on the rails.</i>

331
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,647
<i>I'm going to give you the names
of different actresses</i>

332
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:32,554
<i>whose pictures you'll have to capture
every time you go on the ride.</i>

333
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,305
You want us to take pictures?

334
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:38,202
<i>If you come back with the pictures of
the actresses whom I've mentioned</i>

335
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:39,913
<i>then you'll succeed the mission.
Is that understood?</i>

336
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,212
How do you expect us to take the pictures
when we're going to speed by them?

337
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:44,740
- You have to take them however you can.
- The camera will have a sports mode.

338
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,333
- Really?
- It's a quick succession of pictures.

339
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,140
[Very optimistic ride enthusiast.]

340
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:51,898
<i>We'll give you numbers one through nine if
you succeed on your first attempt.</i>

341
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,757
<i>If you succeed on your second attempt,
then you'll be given seven numbers.</i>

342
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,240
<i>Five numbers on your third attempt,
and three numbers for all the rest.</i>

343
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,209
[Seven numbers on the second attempt,
and three numbers for all the rest.]

344
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:05,513
I'm not good with amusement rides.
To assign this task to someone like me...

345
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,855
[Come on.]

346
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:14,213
- You really don't like these rides?
- No, I don't like rides like these.

347
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,767
I really hate heights.
Do you not fear heights?

348
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,257
- I really love these rides.
- You like this stuff?

349
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:27,516
[Confident Actor Lee and
Crybaby Yoo Hyuk enter the platform.]

350
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,739
Wow, it's so nice
having this all to ourselves.

351
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,817
I think we need to get way up front.

352
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,014
I can't even open my eyes
on rides like these.

353
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:37,142
Then can I take both the cameras?

354
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,674
That's what I'm saying.
Do you think you can handle two at once?

355
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:45,471
[What will result of his confidence?]

356
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,792
- Yoo Jae Suk is assigned with Park Shin Hye.
- Okay, Park Shin Hye. Okay, I understand.

357
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:56,982
- For Sung Jae, it's Jeon Ji Hyun.
- Yes, I've worked with her in the past.

358
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:59,434
- When did you ever work with her?
- We did a movie together.

359
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:03,456
- The movie was titled, 'Daisy'.
- Ah, that movie?

360
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:05,092
You just don't know because
you've never seen the movie.

361
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,324
[Flustered]

362
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:11,880
Yes, I'm sorry.
I haven't seen that movie yet.

363
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:18,265
[Time for talk is over.
It's now time to face the speed.]

364
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,956
[Carefully places himself in his seat.]

365
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,035
I'm in big trouble.

366
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:31,072
- Wow, I haven't done this in a whole year.
- I feel like I'm going to lose it.

367
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,440
- Do I really need to do this?
- What are you doing?

368
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,386
I'm just testing out the camera.

369
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,698
[Very prepared and detailed.
Practicing his picture taking skills.]

370
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:42,547
What do you mean, am I ready?
Are you kidding me?

371
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,261
I seriously... ugh.

372
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:50,570
[No matter what he says,
the ride will get on its way.]

373
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:53,397
[The fateful ride gets on its way with
their numerical cards on the line.]

374
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:56,628
- Wrap the camera cord around your wrist.
- I can't do this.

375
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,693
- Wrap it around your wrist like this.
- I'm really scared right now.

376
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:03,558
[Whether Jae Suk is scared or not,
Sung Jae's just excited about the ride.]

377
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,354
[Nonstop nagging.]

378
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:11,581
I really hate this.
I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

379
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,299
How are we going to do this?

380
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,101
- It's fun!
- How is this any fun?

381
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:20,502
See?
See, we're going up!

382
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:28,965
[Heads higher into the sky...]

383
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,712
Sung Jae, I really can't do this.

384
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:34,804
[Arrives at the highest point of 56m.]

385
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,738
- No, I don't think I can do this.
- It's faster than anything else I've been on.

386
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:41,912
I feel like we're moving really fast.

387
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,892
[A face to face meet with the sky.]

388
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:50,600
[Please, stop!
I'll be good from now on!]

389
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:54,476
[It's not time yet.]

390
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,592
[State of extreme nervousness and terror.]

391
00:21:57,014 --> 00:22:00,940
Sung Jae, I don't like things like this.

392
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:04,207
[Slowly heading towards the dropping point.]

393
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,299
- You can let go.
- No, I can't.

394
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,785
[Thinking about the mission-
Thinking about his mommy.]

395
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:20,439
[It's now time... to face your fears.]

396
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,973
- No, you can let go.
- Look at this!

397
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,964
[A dead drop.]

398
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,821
[A sudden drop from the height of 56m.]

399
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,685
[Even his soul has left his body.]

400
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:59,319
[The wooden rollercoaster speeds on
without any hesitation.]

401
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,226
[Thanks, but we'll pass on the ride!]

402
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,882
[Did you all see the pictures?]

403
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:10,839
[They just passed Jeon Ji Hyun's picture.]

404
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:16,065
[Did the ever-so confident
Sung Jae get the picture?]

405
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,096
[What was the mission again?]

406
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,055
[Before they can even recover,
it's now time for the second drop.]

407
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,617
[A face full of terrorizing fear.]

408
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,403
[A sudden twist in the course.]

409
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,705
[Screams out in utter terror and fear.]

410
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:47,274
- Did you take the picture?
- I didn't even see the picture.

411
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:52,565
[Time for another sudden death drop.]

412
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,919
[Park Shin Hye,
with a bright smile on her face.]

413
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:06,212
[Sung Jae is clicking on his shutter
as fast as he can.]

414
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:09,414
[But did he capture the picture?]

415
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:14,091
[Even the famed actress can't stop
this nonstop train!]

416
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,161
[A little bump on the road!]

417
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:32,619
I don't think I got any pictures,
so I'll just take one of you instead.

418
00:24:34,781 --> 00:24:37,309
[Stay strong, guys!]

419
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:40,127
[I can't even keep my own head up anymore...]

420
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,463
Who's this?

421
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:47,997
[That's our Gook Joo!]

422
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:49,495
Who is this?

423
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:51,567
[Now that he's starting to come to,
Gook Joo is all he manages to see.]

424
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,401
I can't even see anything.

425
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:06,937
[These photographers
didn't even get anything.]

426
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,072
There's no way to take the pictures.
You did good though.

427
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,437
[The ride ends after
three minutes of screaming.]

428
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:16,620
There's just no way to take
these pictures.

429
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,320
Sung Jae, I can't do this.

430
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:23,294
- It's fun.
- You're having fun?

431
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:26,158
I heard you cursing during the ride.

432
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,664
Don't lie about it having been fun.

433
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:32,941
- You didn't get any pictures, did you?
- No, taking pictures is impossible.

434
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:36,147
- I can't even see anything.
- Taking pictures is impossible.

435
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,828
- It's just way too fast for that.
- I can't even see anything.

436
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,136
I can see just fine,
and even I can't take the pictures.

437
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,578
He told me that he likes these rides,
but even he started cussing.

438
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,626
- He started cussing in a foreign language.
- No, I didn't.

439
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:54,764
- The camera has it recorded.
- What are you talking about?

440
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,736
Sung Jae... wow, seriously?

441
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:00,784
- Show me any pictures that you took.
- I don't have anything.

442
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:03,183
- I don't have a single one.
- You don't have any?

443
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,132
These are the pictures that you took?

444
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,640
[Photographer, Sung Jae's work.]

445
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,806
[His taste seems to run more towards
the ride than the female actresses.]

446
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:15,071
Something flew in my mouth earlier,
and I think it was a bug.

447
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,640
[No way...]

448
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,134
I think there's a fly in my shirt.

449
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,719
[Something inside his shirt?]

450
00:26:27,077 --> 00:26:30,254
[A dragonfly!]

451
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,854
[A dragonfly flew in Sung Jae's mouth!]

452
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:38,181
- When did a dragonfly fly in there?
- I think it was while I was screaming.

453
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,469
- A dragonfly?
- I'm not sure if it was a dragonfly.

454
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,848
What do you mean, you're not sure?
This is a dragonfly.

455
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,105
[While his only memory of the 104km ride
was a kiss with the dragonfly...]

456
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,635
[Gyunggi-do Gwacheon.]

457
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:58,016
- We're ruined, Ji Hyo.
- What are we going to do?

458
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,280
- But you're good at things like this.
- No, I'm not.

459
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:05,485
- I've gotten weaker, much weaker.
- Why? Is it because you've gotten older?

460
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:13,749
[Sky X]

461
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:21,036
[50m midair... enjoy flying through
the sky at 100km an hour!]

462
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:24,354
[Bungee jump has nothing on this ride!]

463
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:30,664
<i>The mission you'll be doing on this
ride is, 'Midair padlock.'</i>

464
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:35,405
- Here's your padlock.
- Are they going to ask us to unlock this?

465
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,786
[Nothing but a deep sigh of breath...]

466
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:42,203
<i>Do you see the different
colored boards in front of you?</i>

467
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:47,659
<i>Red, orange, yellow and green.
There will be different items on these mats.</i>

468
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:51,779
<i>The number of items on the red mat
will be your first digit.</i>

469
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,237
<i>The orange one will have the second digit,
the yellow one will have the third digit</i>

470
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:57,561
<i>and the green mat will have
the fourth digit to the combination.</i>

471
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:59,825
I have a 2.0 eyesight.

472
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,422
I can see things very clearly.

473
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:06,364
You know what I'm nervous about right now?
I'm suddenly reminded of 'Kim Enthusiastic.'

474
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:08,982
Dong Joon... Kim Enthusiastic.

475
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:11,516
Are you Kim Enthusiastic No. 2?

476
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:14,228
- Are you 'Im Enthusiastic'?
- No, I can do this, Ji Hyo.

477
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:15,538
[Seulong, The King of Enthusiasm.]

478
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,652
[50m in midair...]

479
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:23,686
- Seulong, you can do this, right?
- Yes.

480
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:27,506
[The padlock is locked around
Ji Hyo and Seulong's waist.]

481
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:31,756
[It's time to take the feet off the ground.]

482
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,299
Mom!

483
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:42,378
[Lifting off the ground!]

484
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:46,510
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do about this?

485
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:49,302
My hands are shaking.

486
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:56,457
[Baby Blank Ji cries for her mom again.]

487
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,428
[Who is she calling 'Im Enthusiastic'?]

488
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:02,683
[So high up in the air already that
people on the ground look tiny as ants.]

489
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:07,650
- Wow, this is really high up.
- Ugh, seriously... are you serious?

490
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:11,548
[Almost up to the top already.]

491
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,402
[Can't help but laugh at the situation.]

492
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:19,627
What are we going to do?

493
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:25,071
You can't get nervous on me.

494
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:26,430
[Arrives at the top height of 50m.]

495
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:30,362
[Ready for takeoff.]

496
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:33,799
- You can't get nervous on me.
- Are you ready?

497
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,531
Go!

498
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:43,270
[They have to pull the lever themselves.]

499
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:47,441
No, don't do it.
No, not yet!

500
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:52,464
[Not an easy height to pull the lever
of their own will.]

501
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,314
Mind control.

502
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,918
[Accurately count the number of
the items on these colored mats.]

503
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,298
- Are you ready?
- No.

504
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,975
[Mind control, fail.]

505
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,199
Okay, I'm ready to go.

506
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,998
[It's time to pull the lever!]

507
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:21,686
- Okay, here we go!
- Why are you shaking like a leaf?

508
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:26,643
- Stop shaking, Seulong. Don't shake.
- You're about to break my hand, Ji Hyo.

509
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,607
Okay, here I go!

510
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,558
Challenge!

511
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,578
Challenge!

512
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:40,966
One, two, three!

513
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:43,887
Three!

514
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,248
[The lever is pulled!]

515
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,808
[Flies through the sky like Iron Man!]

516
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:03,835
[Iron Woman's shouting from 50m midair.]

517
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,684
[The items on the mats.]

518
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:12,049
[They have to count the number of
the items placed on the mats.]

519
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,710
How are we supposed to count that?

520
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,426
Pull yourself together!

521
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:23,069
[Did they see the items?]

522
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:26,135
Hang on, I have a cramp on my side.

523
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,450
Hey, this isn't the time for that right now.
Get yourself together!

524
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,445
[Iron Woman's second shouting.]

525
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:37,826
[Hard to count the number of items
at the speed that they're flying.]

526
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:41,884
- Oh my God.
- I can't see.

527
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,913
[They have to see the items
in order to unlock the padlock.]

528
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:53,479
[Time over]

529
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,897
Five for the red.

530
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,936
- What about the green?
- I didn't get to see.

531
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:04,154
Green... I think it was eight.

532
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,714
- Eight?
- Yes, eight.

533
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,283
[Flight is now over.]

534
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,363
- That wasn't right, Seulong.
- Eight.

535
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,521
- Green was eight.
- I did do eight for the green.

536
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,764
[Unable to unlock the padlock.]

537
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:19,222
<i>You have failed the mission.</i>

538
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:21,041
[Fails the first attempt of the mission.]

539
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,613
<i>You have failed the mission.</i>

540
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,793
<i>You can get started on your
second attempt.</i>

541
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,962
[Nothing... but a feeling of hopelessness.]

542
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,332
[Gwangju Metropolitan]

543
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,794
<i>The ride you'll be doing your mission on
is the only one that exists in this country.</i>

544
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:48,664
- It's a ride called, Chaos.
- Do you know what 'Chaos' is?

545
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:51,036
Doesn't that mean, chaotic?

546
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,923
Yes, I know what that means, too.

547
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:58,445
I just asked if you knew what that was.
I was going to tell them myself.

548
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:03,043
It means, to be chaotic.
Is it going to make me dizzy?

549
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,230
[Chaos- the infamous
amusement ride in Gwangju.]

550
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:17,045
[Experience the thrill of a complete
360 degree turn.]

551
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:21,918
[Welcome to, Chaos World.]

552
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,399
Do we sit together?

553
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,405
I don't think people
with big heads can fit in here.

554
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,945
- Don't you think so?
- Yes, it's very narrow.

555
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:31,444
Here's your mission.

556
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:36,254
It's 'Eat the dried persimmon' game.
This is my favorite game!

557
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,358
I played this game this morning
before I left the house.

558
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,093
You know this game, right?

559
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:44,892
[A rich history of having played
this game in the past.]

560
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:48,257
[Giraffe is an expert
when it comes to this game.]

561
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,956
[Leave the dried persimmons to me.]

562
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:55,701
You have to eat the persimmons.
You look good in the hat.

563
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,915
I was a king.

564
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:03,654
<i>I really want some dried persimmons.</i>

565
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:05,768
<i>Bring me some dried persimmons.</i>

566
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:10,584
<i>I really want some sweet and
chewy dried persimmons.</i>

567
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:15,214
[King of dried persimmons, Chang Wook.]

568
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:20,868
[Eat the dried persimmons dangling from
the hat while being spun around in the ride.]

569
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:25,872
<i>Okay, we will now start
the persimmon mission.</i>

570
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:28,744
- Let's get this done on the first try.
- I'm scared of the ride.

571
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,449
If we fail it on the first try,
then we have to do it again.

572
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,455
It's spinning.

573
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,760
Can we start eating now?

574
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,264
[The ride slowly starts to turn and spin.]

575
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:45,769
- It goes up, too?
- I told you that it goes up.

576
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:50,851
[The mission can start only after
the whistle has been blown.]

577
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,229
[Once the ride has reached its height,
that's when the real spinning starts.]

578
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,061
If it just stays at this pace,
then I think we can do it.

579
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:02,520
- I'm sure it's going to start going faster.
- If we fail, then we'll have to do it again.

580
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,813
We have to get this done.

581
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,963
[Flying Giraffe... and King of persimmons.]

582
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:21,368
Mine disappeared.

583
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,700
[It got tangled up!]

584
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:28,756
Wait, my dried persimmon!

585
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:38,570
[Their cries for the dried persimmon
can be heard echoing through the park.]

586
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,888
[Truly getting into the spin now.]

587
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,997
[This is the real world of Chaos!]

588
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,206
Wait!

589
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:53,843
[The ride is enough to stimulate
one's salivary glands.]

590
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:58,823
[Mission aside, they're too busy just trying
to keep their sanity intact.]

591
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:03,815
- My dried persimmon!
- My dried persimmon's disappeared.

592
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:06,537
<i>I really want some dried persimmons.</i>

593
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:09,250
- Where's my dried persimmon?
- My dried persimmon's disappeared.

594
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,082
- Dried persimmon...
- I want to give up!

595
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,716
Please!

596
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,623
[Please let me off of this ride...]

597
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:20,337
[First attempt- Time over.]

598
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:30,912
What the heck is this?

599
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:35,914
[Gloomy dried persimmon brothers.]

600
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:40,216
Don't you think that
these games are just too much?

601
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,939
- My dried persimmon disappeared right away.
- My dried persimmon...

602
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:48,743
Can we not even get off?

603
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:51,021
What did you do?
How did this even happen?

604
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:57,587
[Unraveling the tangled persimmon lines.]

605
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:00,369
This ride is too much.

606
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:04,005
- You have stuff in your eye.
- That's because I was crying.

607
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,739
[The hot tears of a man who has
experienced true chaos.]

608
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,357
How about I turn my head,
and flick my persimmon over to you?

609
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,694
When I do, eat the persimmon.

610
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:17,833
[Something about it is a bit pitiful.]

611
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:21,368
How about this?
Okay!

612
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:24,297
You're getting too much spit on it.

613
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:27,640
It's going to be mine anyways, right?
Since we're going to feed it to each other?

614
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:30,315
Just try to eat it cleaner
since I could end up eating it too.

615
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:33,015
[Practice, and practice some more.]

616
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:36,315
Once we get up there,
I'll flick it over to you first.

617
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:38,734
Hold on to your hat, too.

618
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:47,865
[Time... we vow to succeed.]

619
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,892
- No, it's not time yet.
- Focus your mind on the persimmon!

620
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,622
Okay, here we go.
I'll give it to you first.

621
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:58,467
Here, eat it.
Eat it, Kwang Soo.

622
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:01,066
[Is it a success?]

623
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:09,348
[So close, but he fails to catch
the persimmon in his mouth.]

624
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:15,389
My persimmon flew off my string!

625
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,267
[The persimmon is gone!]

626
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:20,019
My persimmon flew off my string!

627
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,379
[The persimmon disappears again!]

628
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:27,203
[The moment he lost the persimmon...]

629
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,097
Stop the ride!

630
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:34,610
[We don't even have a persimmon...
so why must we...]

631
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:36,965
[Keep on spinning on this ride?]

632
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,002
[Kyungsan Yangsan.]

633
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,079
I really am horrible with numbers.

634
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,802
- I think I'm going to be the black hole.
- No, I'm going to be the real black hole.

635
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:53,822
She got unlucky with her partner.

636
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:54,847
[The black hole couple is
feeling bad for one another.]

637
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:58,991
- I'm really bad with numbers.
- Minuses and pluses still confuse me.

638
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:03,531
The mission which you'll be doing is,
'High altitude karaoke room.'

639
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:10,289
You must score over 90 points by singing
while riding on the amusement ride.

640
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,985
We have to sing?

641
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:16,071
[This is where you'll be singing!]

642
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:19,729
[Three cyclone twists in a row,
and two 360 hairpin spins in a row.]

643
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,576
[An all in one rollercoaster.]

644
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:27,431
[On top of the water pond-
A fantasia special.]

645
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:32,138
Is it okay to be sweating like this already?

646
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:35,001
- I'm so scared.
- Okay, you are ready to go.

647
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:37,271
Okay, get ready to takeoff.

648
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:39,001
[Singer couple must get ready to sing.]

649
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,444
What do I do?

650
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:44,465
[Accompanying music starts.]

651
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,183
[Ailee's new song, 'I will show you.']

652
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:55,551
- Yes, just sing it like that.
- Really? You want me to just scream it?

653
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:58,053
[Screaming is how he can best
help succeed the mission?]

654
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:05,098
[Ailee's midair stage performance.]

655
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,051
[Rollercoaster karaoke bar is on the move.]

656
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:18,471
[Time to take a deep breath before
the ride really takes off.]

657
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:24,467
[Ever the pro, Ailee focuses on her singing
even in the state of extreme nervousness.]

658
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,806
[Entering the pitch dark cave.]

659
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,647
[Have fun!]

660
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,952
[Steadily climbs up to the peak.]

661
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,568
[A vocal explosion.]

662
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:03,166
[The train keeps climbing,
and her voice also keeps on climbing.]

663
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:07,246
[The train continues
to head towards the sky.]

664
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,991
[Concentrates on singing.]

665
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:17,245
[Focus is shattered.]

666
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:24,112
[Supersonic sound.]

667
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,740
[A fan in awe.]

668
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,788
I forgot the lyrics!

669
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:34,044
[A dead drop.]

670
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,615
[Time for the twists and turns!]

671
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,673
<i>[Even if it's a chance meeting...]</i>

672
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:57,994
[Ailee's powerful vocals.]

673
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:01,961
[Overcome with emotions while singing?]

674
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,099
[Nothing but empty laughter.]

675
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,814
[From twists to the flips.]

676
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,952
[Seven octaves.]

677
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:21,335
[This fan is about to lose his
consciousness.]

678
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:26,877
[Time for the second flip.]

679
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:41,489
[Now that his sanity has returned,
he resumes his cheer.]

680
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,073
[Ailee's singing shines on
through to the end.]

681
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:52,236
[Karaoke bar returns to base.]

682
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:20,198
[The Diva... and her fan
are both about to pass out.]

683
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:24,257
[If they succeed at first attempt,
then they earn all nine of the numbers.]

684
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:29,440
64 points?

685
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,597
[Fails the first attempt at karaoke mission.]

686
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:35,312
- Wait...
- Both of you have to sing together.

687
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,597
[It seems as though it may be because
Ailee was the only person singing.]

688
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:40,957
I'm too scared to go again.

689
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,219
Even in the midst of all this,
Ailee still sang so well.

690
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,490
[That's our Ailee!
The amazing, and unbeatable voice.]

691
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:51,908
[Second attempt for seven number cards.]

692
00:43:57,074 --> 00:44:00,369
You can't go already when
the song hasn't even started yet.

693
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,628
No, I'm not ready yet.

694
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:06,216
[The ride takes off on a melodic tune.]

695
00:44:06,217 --> 00:44:07,866
Okay, start singing.

696
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,900
[Their two voices seemingly
meld very well together.]

697
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:41,188
[Today, it'll be with the rollercoaster...]

698
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:45,224
[Witnessing the rare visual of
Gary, the rapper.]

699
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:52,707
[Getting closer and closer to that point...]

700
00:44:57,844 --> 00:45:02,066
[Here it comes... it's coming...]

701
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:06,066
[Up the speed!]

702
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:09,707
[Time for the drop!]

703
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,110
No!

704
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,698
[The frozen expression on his face.]

705
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,698
[The terrorizing twist.]

706
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,495
<i>A woman I can't break up with!</i>

707
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,036
[An angry woman...]

708
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,793
[The melodic screams that
echo throughout the pond...]

709
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:48,194
Isn't Ailee one of the guests?

710
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:49,969
- She and I go to the same salon.
- Seriously?

711
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,920
I was told when I went in this morning
that Ailee came in at two for her makeup.

712
00:45:55,446 --> 00:45:59,846
So I was thinking that I'd get a chance to
meet Ailee when I came on the show.

713
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:03,416
- She came in at two in the morning?
- She left after her makeup at two.

714
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:06,702
<i>Through the use of the numbers you've
earned and various numeric symbols</i>

715
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,630
<i>you have to turn the number 1470,
into a zero.</i>

716
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:13,945
- Through the numeric symbols?
- The mission which you'll be doing...

717
00:46:13,946 --> 00:46:16,311
<i>The mission is called,
'Word telepathy.'</i>

718
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:20,033
<i>While you two are enjoying yourselves
on the amusement ride</i>

719
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:23,015
<i>you have to correctly guess the word that's
written on the bottom of each other's foot.</i>

720
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:26,577
<i>You have to correctly guess all the words
in order to successfully pass the mission.</i>

721
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,855
<i>If you succeed the mission
on the first attempt</i>

722
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,864
<i>then you'll be given all the numbers,
one through nine.</i>

723
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,422
[Quicker you succeed the mission,
more number cards you can earn.]

724
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,430
Let's just get it done, and move on.

725
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:39,604
- I'm not good with rides.
- Hello.

726
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,710
- Which seat is the least scary?
- They're all scary.

727
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:46,621
[A very blunt ride operator.]

728
00:46:46,622 --> 00:46:48,376
- You can sit over there.
- Why?

729
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:51,536
- Because the outer seat...
- You think that'll be scarier?

730
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:53,755
- Yeah, I think it'll be scarier.
- Wow, seriously.

731
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:57,263
How are we supposed to see like this?
- Is it on the left foot?

732
00:46:57,264 --> 00:46:59,609
But my legs are really short.

733
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:01,889
You can't peek right now.

734
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:04,592
- How can we show it to each other?
- Is it on both feet?

735
00:47:04,593 --> 00:47:07,339
How am I to show it to her?

736
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:12,660
[Eun Yi- Chul Long.
Suk Jin- Ssuk Dduk.]

737
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,894
- We will now start your first attempt.
- Okay, let's succeed.

738
00:47:14,895 --> 00:47:20,752
Let's just finish this at once
and remain as good friends.

739
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:24,108
- Taking too long won't do us any good.
- Okay, let's just get this done.

740
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,789
Okay, that sounds good.

741
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:31,845
[Let's Twist is on!]

742
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:33,953
Wait, wait.
I must be crazy.

743
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:37,559
I really hate things like this.

744
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,667
I hate it when my feet
can't touch the ground.

745
00:47:40,062 --> 00:47:42,325
It doesn't matter to me since my
feet usually can't touch the ground.

746
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,679
No, I really can't do this!

747
00:47:47,802 --> 00:47:51,167
Please!
Don't do this!

748
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,818
Wow, this is really high.

749
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:02,521
[Let's twist.]

750
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:12,391
[Are they screaming?
Or laughing?]

751
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,249
[A great view of both
the sky and the ground.]

752
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,968
[Start the mission!]

753
00:48:27,919 --> 00:48:30,326
- Lift up your legs!
- Wait.

754
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:33,728
[They have to show each other
the bottoms of their feet.]

755
00:48:34,724 --> 00:48:38,003
[But the Twist King
isn't giving them any chances.]

756
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:51,441
[Correct answer- Chul Long and Ssuk Dduk.]

757
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,563
Your left foot says, 'Dduk'.

758
00:48:54,073 --> 00:48:57,268
[Another twist.]

759
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:04,603
I can't see my own feet.
You look at what my foot says.

760
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:07,143
[Eun Yi shows Big-nose her foot.]

761
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,564
- I think it says, 'Sul'.
- Is it, 'Sul Lae Beol Dduk'?

762
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:11,633
- What is that?
-  'Sul Lae Beol Dduk'?

763
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:13,793
Show me the other foot.

764
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:19,023
[First attempt is over.]

765
00:49:28,774 --> 00:49:31,485
[Did he pass out?]

766
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:39,427
<i>Say what the writing on your own foot
says on the count of three.</i>

767
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:42,243
- Hul Lae.
- Beol Dduk.

768
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,597
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi fail
their first attempt.]

769
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:48,778
- I think we're wrong. Can we see now?
- Yes, you may take a look.

770
00:49:54,113 --> 00:49:56,858
[Dumb and dumber.]

771
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,917
How are we ever going to turn 1470
into a zero at this rate?

772
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:02,624
When are we ever going to do that?
I bet someone else is on that.

773
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:04,553
I wonder who's on that ride.

774
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,605
[Just then, they discover T-Express
off in the distance.]

775
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,992
- It's climbing up right now.
- They can't hear us, can they?

776
00:50:10,993 --> 00:50:13,138
Fighting!

777
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:17,857
[Can't hear you.]

778
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:24,013
[Jae Suk and Sung Jae are on their
second attempt of the paparazzi mission.]

779
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:30,176
- There they go! It's going down.
- Jae Suk's really scared of rides like that.

780
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:32,109
Jae Suk should be on it.

781
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:36,391
[No need to worry about that.]

782
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:40,554
Once it goes down a couple of times,
it starts to twist like this.

783
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:43,068
- It's a twist and turn like this.
- That's what that one does.

784
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:48,129
[But Eun Yi's friend isn't having
any fun at all.]

785
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:58,332
[Please let me off!]

786
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:08,931
[Incheon Weolmi Island.]

787
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:12,460
So this is why Michael Jackson had
an amusement park built at his home.

788
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:16,277
<i>Here's your first mission where you can
earn your number cards.</i>

789
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:19,438
<i>This mission is called, 'Hurray Viking.'</i>

790
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:21,322
What?
You want us to get on the Viking?

791
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:23,955
You want us to get on this ride?

792
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:28,286
[This is... the infamous...]

793
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:32,014
[Weolmi Island Viking.]

794
00:51:32,015 --> 00:51:36,355
[Speed and height...
This has got both!]

795
00:51:36,356 --> 00:51:38,876
[The ride of terrorizing fear?]

796
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:45,248
- Hurray Viking.
- Okay.

797
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:49,810
<i>You will get on the ride with a water balloon
placed between your cheeks and your arms.</i>

798
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:54,313
- If the balloon falls, then you fail.
- We're not going to let that happen.

799
00:51:54,314 --> 00:51:57,684
- Can the water balloon even get in there?
- What if it doesn't?

800
00:51:57,685 --> 00:52:02,319
My shoulders are like rocks
when I lift up my arms like this.

801
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,117
- His shirt is about to rip right here.
- Okay, you may now get on the ride.

802
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:08,989
[Time to board the Viking ship.]

803
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,084
- It's okay, we can do this.
- Yes, I feel confident about it.

804
00:52:13,118 --> 00:52:16,149
This isn't even a game compared to
some of the other stuff I've done.

805
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,952
Why is the balloon so small?

806
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:22,909
I'm sorry, but my arm can't
even do this.

807
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,367
[Then lose some of your muscle...]

808
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,591
My arms are starting to hurt already.

809
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:34,864
You look really cute like that.

810
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,280
Okay, we will now get started.

811
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:43,952
[The balloons pops before they
even get started on the mission.]

812
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,716
That's because you're too strong.

813
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:49,640
- You have to be more careful.
- I'll hold onto it for you.

814
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,872
It just popped.

815
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:55,601
[But that's not the end of it. The
water gun snipers will also lend a hand.]

816
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:58,537
They're going to be shooting at us?
What will you guys think up next?

817
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:04,154
We will now get started.
Get ready, the ready will start.

818
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:11,978
[The legendary Viking of Weolmi Island.
Time to get on the move.]

819
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:15,814
[Riding the waves with some force.]

820
00:53:15,815 --> 00:53:18,939
- Here it comes!
- Already?

821
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,540
I can feel it.
Here it comes.

822
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,971
[The Viking starts to pick up
speed and height.]

823
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:38,583
[It's only up to half the height.]

824
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:42,049
Place the balloon in its position.

825
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,241
Wait a second.

826
00:53:46,425 --> 00:53:48,569
Wait a minute.

827
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:52,625
[Nothing but empty laughter at the
terror that they're starting to feel.]

828
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:57,756
[The waves are only
starting to get rougher.]

829
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:03,137
[Places the balloons in position
with Tae Woo's help.]

830
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:05,027
Wait, wait a second.

831
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:11,151
You have to lift up both your hands
up towards the sky.

832
00:54:13,979 --> 00:54:16,085
[Come with me!]

833
00:54:17,497 --> 00:54:19,813
[Mission start.]

834
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,683
[Up into the sky!]

835
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:25,584
[Mommy!]

836
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:29,393
[Add in a couple of water gun snipers.]

837
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,645
This is absurd!
Just absurd!

838
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,838
[Reaches the final height of the ride.]

839
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,431
[A staccato scream.]

840
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:48,559
[This is the full glory of the Viking.]

841
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:53,433
[Just then...]

842
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:58,677
I dropped the balloon!

843
00:54:59,477 --> 00:55:01,885
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo fail
the first attempt.]

844
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,897
- I dropped it!
- Running Man!

845
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:09,090
I said, I dropped it!
I dropped the balloon!

846
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:13,007
- I said, I dropped the balloon!
- Stop the ride!

847
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:17,395
I dropped it!

848
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:20,411
I said, I dropped the balloon!

849
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,189
[While Kkuk continues to cry out,
down in the southern region...]

850
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:29,127
For the first time of Running Man history

851
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:31,160
I'm going to use every dirty
little trick I have up my sleeve.

852
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,660
The first mission that
you will be doing today is

853
00:55:34,695 --> 00:55:36,651
'Shoot the water glass.'

854
00:55:36,652 --> 00:55:40,825
- Shoot the water glass?
- Take a look at the ride to your left.

855
00:55:40,826 --> 00:55:42,820
[Apollo- The most famous ride
in Gyungsan Namdo.]

856
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:47,515
While you two enjoy your ride,
fill the pitcher with water to the line.

857
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:52,485
- Just fill it up to the line to succeed.
- Okay, we'll give it a try.

858
00:55:52,486 --> 00:55:54,709
- Let's finish this at once.
- Okay, let's get this done.

859
00:55:57,173 --> 00:56:00,579
- I think this is going to be scary.
- I hate rides like this.

860
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,557
It's even worse having to go on a ride
with another guy like Skull.

861
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:09,085
I've never even brought my wife
to an amusement park before.

862
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:12,251
[Oh my goodness... you scared us!]

863
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:14,990
[Who are you?]

864
00:56:14,991 --> 00:56:20,820
This is the moment where the infamous
Skull lifts up his curtains.

865
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:24,825
[Reggae Skull opens up his curtains
to board the Apollo.]

866
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:33,096
How far do you think this is
going to go up?

867
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:35,420
Yes, we're ready.

868
00:56:35,421 --> 00:56:40,857
[If you're ready... then let's go!]

869
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:46,498
[The mission is just starting,
and it's already looking not so good.]

870
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:48,374
Okay, we have to get this done
on our first try.

871
00:56:50,484 --> 00:56:54,133
[The angle's starting to
get deeper and deeper.]

872
00:56:54,134 --> 00:56:58,704
Okay, tip it towards you
a bit when it goes up.

873
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:01,373
[Has to tip the glass along
with the angle of the ride.]

874
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:05,466
Okay, I think I got it.
This is scary!

875
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,710
[But the problem is,
this is one terrifying ride.]

876
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:11,964
- This is really scary.
- We can do this!

877
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,458
- You have to endure through it, Skull.
- Let's get this done.

878
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:20,514
How are we supposed to do this?

879
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,578
[Something that they're used to
hearing in the bathrooms.]

880
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:36,398
- No!
- This is not even right!

881
00:57:38,691 --> 00:57:42,762
[This angle makes it impossible
to follow their plans.]

882
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,984
I'm so sorry.

883
00:57:47,985 --> 00:57:52,270
All my water spilled out.

884
00:57:52,756 --> 00:57:55,804
[Both water glasses
are now completely empty.]

885
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,902
- How can we do this upside down?
- You guys are a bunch of crooks!

886
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,051
I said, this ride's over!

887
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:08,913
I said, we failed the mission!
Mister!

888
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:13,532
[Sounds awfully similar to Kkuk.]

889
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,230
How are we ever supposed to do this?

890
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:20,006
- Please come to the weighing station.
- We've got nothing to bring.

891
00:58:20,978 --> 00:58:24,432
We've got absolutely nothing.
It's all gone.

892
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:31,456
[Ha Ha and Skull's second attempt-
Block the water in with their mouths.]

893
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:34,427
[If they can only stand
the 360 degree turn...]

894
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,157
It totally went up my nose.

895
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:45,739
Ugh, it went up my nose.

896
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:50,270
[But...]

897
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:52,813
[Ha Ha stuck it out.]

898
00:58:53,926 --> 00:58:57,726
[Will it be enough to fill up to the line?]

899
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:59,837
We'll never succeed unless we both do it.

900
00:59:06,648 --> 00:59:08,841
[Back in Gwangju.]

901
00:59:10,282 --> 00:59:13,649
[These two men are still
wrestling with their dried persimmon.]

902
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,608
Eat it.
Did you get it?

903
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:18,400
- Did you get it? I'm not moving.
- Don't move.

904
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,386
Did you get it?

905
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:27,409
It's caught.

906
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,303
Just a little bit more!

907
00:59:29,304 --> 00:59:31,415
[Bye, persimmon!]

908
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,393
[A 360 degree battle with the persimmon.]

909
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:37,397
Okay, one more time.

910
00:59:42,998 --> 00:59:46,244
[Finally succeeds at eating the persimmon
on their third attempt.]

911
00:59:46,245 --> 00:59:48,916
- Okay, you got it.
- Your turn next.

912
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:51,305
[If Chang Wook can succeed,
then they will earn five number cards.]

913
00:59:51,306 --> 00:59:53,492
- Eat it!
- Wait, hang on.

914
00:59:54,317 --> 00:59:56,365
- This is it.
- Eat it!

915
00:59:56,366 --> 00:59:58,342
Eat it!

916
00:59:58,343 --> 01:00:00,396
[Time over- Fails the third attempt.]

917
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,985
[The persimmon he so desperately
wanted 700 years ago...]

918
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:10,141
[Will he not get to eat it today either?]

919
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:13,231
- Okay, on the count of three.
- No, no.

920
01:00:13,232 --> 01:00:15,137
- I'm going to count to three.
- No, not yet.

921
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:18,559
- One.
- Wait, let's say 'Challenge' first.

922
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,845
[Count the items to unlock the padlock
to succeed the mission.]

923
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:24,593
- Challenge!
- One, two, three!

924
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:32,891
[Time to count the items!]

925
01:00:32,892 --> 01:00:35,057
How many are down there?

926
01:00:35,058 --> 01:00:38,585
How many are down there, Seulong?
Hurry up and count.

927
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:41,704
[Focus]

928
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:56,575
[How many?]

929
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,196
I think I got it. Eight on the
yellow and six on the green.

930
01:01:03,653 --> 01:01:05,867
Did you see that?

931
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:08,579
Did you see anything?

932
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,487
[Time's up.]

933
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:16,207
[Only one chance
to get the correct combination.]

934
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:19,345
I think there were eight on the red.
Wait, let's get off this thing.

935
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:26,013
- Let's get off this ride, Seulong.
- I thought I was going to pass out.

936
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,603
We got it!

937
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:36,069
[Wow, Ace Ji Hyo gets it unlocked
on only her second attempt!]

938
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,749
8786!

939
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:47,623
[Ji Hyo accurately counts all those
items in that short amount of time.]

940
01:01:50,525 --> 01:01:52,396
We did it!

941
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:54,721
[Ji Hyo and Seulong succeed the mission.]

942
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:57,983
We succeeded on our second try.

943
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:03,087
[No matter how scared she may have
been, Ace is still the Ace.]

944
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,091
Come on, Seulong.

945
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:13,283
We just succeeded our mission!
There is no time to waste.

946
01:02:13,284 --> 01:02:16,247
I don't care.
I feel like I'm going to die.

947
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:19,857
I really do feel like I'm going to die, too.

948
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:22,589
How many are there?
One, two, three, four, five... nine.

949
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,066
- Then how many do we get?
- Since you succeeded on your second attempt

950
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:29,981
<i>you can choose seven out of
the nine cards that are on the table.</i>

951
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:32,541
Seven cards?
Okay.

952
01:02:35,957 --> 01:02:41,069
- Are these only numbers?
- Yes, numbers one through nine.

953
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,087
[Numbers one through nine.]

954
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,234
- 1470.
- Ah, 1470.

955
01:02:46,957 --> 01:02:50,683
Then isn't it all over if we were to
choose 1, 4, 7, 0?

956
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,891
[Ji Hyo and Seulong have a
'minus' sign in their arsenal.]

957
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:55,347
Okay, let's choose seven cards.

958
01:02:56,111 --> 01:03:00,445
[First number is... six.]

959
01:03:00,446 --> 01:03:06,555
The sign we end up getting later on is
what's going to make all the difference.

960
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:08,828
- Let's just choose.
- We've made our selection.

961
01:03:09,674 --> 01:03:12,452
[Finishes making their selection
of the seven numbers.]

962
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:18,685
[Ji Hyo and Seulong's numerical cards.]

963
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:25,740
[But they were still unaware...]

964
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,612
[of just how crucial that the numbers
they just chose will become.]

965
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:36,384
[A battle of the minds to turn
1470 into a zero.]

966
01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:41,390
[This is where it all started.]

967
01:03:43,532 --> 01:03:47,285
Okay, let's move on to the next location.
I have to get out of here.

968
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:49,660
- I think...
- Bye.

969
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:54,325
If any of you are seeking sheer terrorizing
fear, then I highly recommend this ride.

970
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:58,467
[Come back again soon!]

971
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,382
You have to wear things like this
when you come to an amusement park.

972
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,401
- Here, try this on.
- You can put it on me.

973
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:04,765
[Puts the headband on Seulong.]

974
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:08,906
- Wow, it looks really good on you.
- Are you sure?

975
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:10,699
[Adorable]

976
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:16,350
[Ji Hyo and Seulong's
amusement park date.]

977
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:21,806
I knew you were going to do that.

978
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:24,659
[Playing around like lovers.]

979
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:29,965
Couples always start off like this,
but end up fighting in the end.

980
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:33,798
- 'I told you not to do that.'
- And come back with someone else after that.

981
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,455
[Angel Blank Ji.]

982
01:04:42,975 --> 01:04:46,183
[The new Monday Couple
are awfully cute together.]

983
01:04:46,184 --> 01:04:49,383
[August 11, 2014- Ji Hyo and
Seulong's amusement park date.]

984
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:56,486
[The highlight of their date-
A haunted house.]

985
01:04:56,487 --> 01:04:58,378
Why is it so dark in here?

986
01:04:58,379 --> 01:05:00,708
[Nighttime camera is used-
Pitch darkness inside the building.]

987
01:05:04,848 --> 01:05:08,233
[Masked Grim Reaper.]

988
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,655
You scared me even more, Ji Hyo.

989
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:17,822
[The fear is the beauty of a
haunted house.]

990
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,639
[The kind Grim Reaper gives
a bonus round of scare.]

991
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:33,518
[Now that they've been frightened properly.
it's time to solve the mystery of the puzzle.]

992
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,942
[These two comedian friends are
screaming side by side.]

993
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:47,988
[Succeed the mission by correctly guessing the
words written on the bottoms of their feet.]

994
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,464
[The moment she glances
down at their feet...]

995
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:57,238
[The ride takes them around
for a twisting turn.]

996
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:00,208
Kkae.
kkae sal.

997
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,227
Do you see mine?
Do you see what's written on mine?

998
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,118
Let go of my foot!

999
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,657
[Twists her foot around to see
what's written on her foot.]

1000
01:06:11,363 --> 01:06:13,586
- Hong, Kkae, Sal.
- I think I know it.

1001
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,888
I know what it says.

1002
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:24,132
[Time to correctly guess the answer.]

1003
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,229
- You know it, right?
- One, two, three.

1004
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,455
- Hong Du.
- Kkae Sal.

1005
01:06:28,456 --> 01:06:30,378
That's the correct answer.

1006
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:31,990
[Hong Du Kkae Sal- Correct answer.]

1007
01:06:34,587 --> 01:06:37,006
- That's right?
- What was that all about?

1008
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:39,462
<i>You are now allowed
to make your card selection.</i>

1009
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:40,972
<i>You may get off the ride.</i>

1010
01:06:42,012 --> 01:06:45,002
<i>There are a total of nine cards,
and you may choose seven.</i>

1011
01:06:45,003 --> 01:06:48,535
- We can pick?
- You have to ultimately get to a zero.

1012
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:54,608
Let's try to pick 1, 4, 7, 0.
There has to be a way.

1013
01:06:55,264 --> 01:06:57,064
- Those two are out.
- Okay, they're out?

1014
01:06:57,065 --> 01:06:59,820
- I don't like this one.
- Okay, you pick.

1015
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:02,261
Five.

1016
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:05,366
[These numerical cards will be the key
to solving the 1470 mystery.]

1017
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:08,078
- We have to get 1470.
- If that's the case, then wait...

1018
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:11,304
[Closer they can get to the numbers, 1470,
the more advantageous it will be for them.]

1019
01:07:11,305 --> 01:07:13,131
[They have one!]

1020
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:15,772
- Four...
- Four!

1021
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:20,456
- We have one, and four.
- Now we need a seven!

1022
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,049
[A disappointing eight.]

1023
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,700
Okay, the last card.

1024
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:29,230
[Time to reveal the final card.]

1025
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:34,455
[There's the seven!]

1026
01:07:35,955 --> 01:07:40,316
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi's cards.]

1027
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:44,480
[The more cards they have in their arsenal,
the more advantageous it'll be.]

1028
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:46,989
I'm getting a good feeling about this.

1029
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:52,712
<i>You now have to take a picture of
No Sa Yeon and Lee Gook Joo.</i>

1030
01:07:52,713 --> 01:07:55,986
I think I know where that is.

1031
01:07:55,987 --> 01:08:01,271
I'll just hold onto my glasses,
and put them on when I see Gook Joo.

1032
01:08:01,272 --> 01:08:04,881
- I know where Gook Joo's picture is.
- You're going to put them on later?

1033
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:06,714
- You won't be able to do that.
- Yes, I can.

1034
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,905
- No, you won't be able to do that.
- I can put them on later when I need them.

1035
01:08:08,906 --> 01:08:10,938
You're going to pass by the picture
before you can even get them on.

1036
01:08:10,939 --> 01:08:13,827
I can't go on this ride again.
This has to be our last attempt.

1037
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:16,756
So we have to succeed this time.
You have to get Sa Yeon's picture, okay?

1038
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,930
Okay? I'll make sure
to get Gook Joo's picture.

1039
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:21,328
Let us know when you're ready,
and we'll start the ride.

1040
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:26,841
[A huge sigh.]

1041
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:30,377
- I feel like I'm going to lose it.
- Okay, we're ready.

1042
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,655
Are you ready?
Are you okay?

1043
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:35,538
What does it even matter
whether I'm ready or not?

1044
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:39,647
- What does it matter if I am or not?
- This is faster than it normally is, right?

1045
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,293
The ride is faster than it
normally is, right?

1046
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:43,373
- It's normally slower than this, right?
- No.

1047
01:08:43,374 --> 01:08:49,666
I feel like it went up slower at first,
but it was faster the second time around.

1048
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,757
- It's not?
- No, it's the usual speed.

1049
01:08:51,758 --> 01:08:54,406
- So this is the usual speed?
- Okay, get ready for takeoff.

1050
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:00,693
You know exactly where
Lee Gook Joo's picture is, right?

1051
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:03,741
I'm sure you'll be able to see it even
without your glasses at that point.

1052
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:07,340
I'm taking my glasses this time.
Don't curse this time, okay?

1053
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:10,262
- I told you that I didn't curse!
- Yes, you did! You cursed earlier.

1054
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:13,017
[Just don't be so frightened.]

1055
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:19,787
- This is the scariest part for me.
- I'm going to lose my mind.

1056
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:24,251
[Slowly being seized by the terror.]

1057
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:31,028
[Ready?]

1058
01:09:31,441 --> 01:09:35,347
The picture is right down there as soon as
the first drop is over.

1059
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:37,731
Just press down on the shutter
as soon as the drop is over.

1060
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:41,927
[Keep your eyes wide open
and look closely!]

1061
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:53,961
[Already about to pass out.]

1062
01:09:55,987 --> 01:10:00,655
[Their third attempt...]

1063
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:04,257
[Feeling pretty unsure
of their success rate.]

1064
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,799
[Time to pick up the speed.]

1065
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:12,160
[Sanity is no longer in his vocabulary.]

1066
01:10:16,898 --> 01:10:19,137
Just tell me when we're close to
Gook Joo's picture.

1067
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:28,252
[The question that pops up in their hands...
Was that really Gook Joo earlier?]

1068
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,656
[The speed of the ride makes it almost
impossible for them to keep their eyes open.]

1069
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,402
It's okay, this isn't that difficult.

1070
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:37,597
Put your glasses on.

1071
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:43,614
[In the midst of this...
he still manages to get his glasses on.]

1072
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:47,857
[They're getting close
to the 'Gook Joo zone'.]

1073
01:10:47,858 --> 01:10:49,243
There it is!

1074
01:10:50,628 --> 01:10:52,639
Take the picture!

1075
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:57,809
[Total focus.]

1076
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:05,375
[Were they able to get the picture?]

1077
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:11,301
I got it.
I got the picture.

1078
01:11:11,302 --> 01:11:13,449
I think I got Sa Yeon's picture too!

1079
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:18,933
[Is that Sa Yeon?]

1080
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:25,394
[No, I don't think you got it...]

1081
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:26,977
What the heck!

1082
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:31,328
- You didn't get it?
- No, I don't think I did.

1083
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,425
You should've gotten the picture!
What were you doing?

1084
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:37,162
- I got the picture!
- I got it too!

1085
01:11:37,973 --> 01:11:41,086
[They're saying that they got
the pictures...]

1086
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:45,023
[But they needs to be judged to make sure
that the pictures are acceptable.]

1087
01:11:47,352 --> 01:11:49,391
My eyes are tearing up.

1088
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,712
Wow, that's seriously so scary.

1089
01:11:54,672 --> 01:11:57,967
[Time to check the pictures.]

1090
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,276
- Gook Joo.
- Okay, there's Lee Gook Joo.

1091
01:12:02,655 --> 01:12:04,550
[I can't go on that again.]

1092
01:12:05,426 --> 01:12:08,623
[Jae Suk gets an accurate picture
of Lee Gook Joo.]

1093
01:12:10,603 --> 01:12:13,747
[Wow, a very close up picture of Sa Yeon!]

1094
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:15,527
Mission success.

1095
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:18,117
[Jae Suk and Sung Jae succeed
the mission.]

1096
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:22,625
[At last... they get to make their escape.]

1097
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,210
[Jae Suk and Sung Jae's cards.]

1098
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:28,134
- You get annoyed easily, don't you?
- No, I don't get annoyed.

1099
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,857
Come on, be honest.
You do get annoyed.

1100
01:12:30,858 --> 01:12:32,485
[Are you two on a date or something?]

1101
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:34,243
It would annoy you if I took
this off, right?

1102
01:12:34,244 --> 01:12:35,781
Yes, it would.

1103
01:12:36,845 --> 01:12:39,408
You're the exhausting type.

1104
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:42,897
This is what you're supposed to do
when you're at an amusement park.

1105
01:12:42,898 --> 01:12:47,893
Who does things like this?
I could understand if we were a couple.

1106
01:12:47,894 --> 01:12:50,500
But why do two grown men
have to walk around like this?

1107
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:55,195
- You want to try this ride?
- Okay, let's get on the ride.

1108
01:12:55,196 --> 01:12:56,413
[Riding on the cable car
to get to their next location.]

1109
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:01,125
It's leaning way too much over on this side.

1110
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,787
Hey!

1111
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:05,991
It's leaning too much on your side.

1112
01:13:05,992 --> 01:13:08,862
[The camera must be very heavy.]

1113
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,543
Sitting like this still won't even it out.

1114
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:17,832
This should be a smooth and steady ride,
but it won't stop swaying with you on it.

1115
01:13:22,204 --> 01:13:24,389
A bag of popcorn would be perfect
right about now.

1116
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:30,289
Eat it!

1117
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:31,933
Eat it!

1118
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:34,940
We need to do it this time.
I really hate amusement park rides.

1119
01:13:37,194 --> 01:13:40,298
[Ha Ha and Skull are trying to save
their water by various different tricks.]

1120
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,040
[At this rate... their lips are going to
end up looking like duck bills.]

1121
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:01,873
[The ride starts to come to an end.]

1122
01:14:01,874 --> 01:14:04,304
Okay, we got this!

1123
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:06,279
[The water glasses still look pretty full.]

1124
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,139
[Both of their waters combined must fill up
at least to the waterline mark.]

1125
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:18,112
[Please...]

1126
01:14:18,113 --> 01:14:21,988
Okay!
We got it!

1127
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:27,057
[Ha Ha and Skull succeed their
water saving mission.]

1128
01:14:29,294 --> 01:14:31,897
[Succeeds the mission on their fourth try.]

1129
01:14:31,898 --> 01:14:34,002
<i>You can choose three cards
out of the deck.</i>

1130
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,604
[Select three cards.]

1131
01:14:36,782 --> 01:14:39,024
We've got 4, 8, and 7.

1132
01:14:39,025 --> 01:14:42,647
[Ha Ha and Skull's cards.]

1133
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,198
<i>You can choose five cards
off the table.</i>

1134
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,537
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo successfully completes
the mission on their third attempt.]

1135
01:14:50,538 --> 01:14:52,302
- Five cards?
- Want to turn them over one by one?

1136
01:14:55,338 --> 01:14:59,234
[The key to solving the 1470 mystery.]

1137
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:02,053
- But there's no zero.
- That's not until the end.

1138
01:15:03,556 --> 01:15:06,645
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo also get
a great selection of cards.]

1139
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:10,767
[This is Gary and Ailee's world.]

1140
01:15:10,768 --> 01:15:13,230
- Hello!
- What are you doing here?

1141
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:14,498
[Ha Ha and Skull comes over to

1142

What's taking you guys so long
when Ailee's such a great singer?

1143
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:20,570
- I'm scared of these rides.
- You're scared of them?

1144
01:15:20,571 --> 01:15:24,108
- Want to come along for a ride?
- No, no way.

1145
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:26,864
- We've already completed our mission.
- How many attempts have you made already?

1146
01:15:26,865 --> 01:15:29,178
- Four times.
- This is our fourth attempt.

1147
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:31,932
- That many times already?
- Come on, come with us.

1148
01:15:31,933 --> 01:15:34,666
- Okay, let's go!
- No, Dong Hoon. Wait!

1149

I'm not ready yet.

1150
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,809
- I'm really scared.
- Sorry, you poor thing.

1151
01:15:41,014 --> 01:15:43,480

then we have to go on the ride again.]

- No, don't show it to him!

Can I take a look in a mirror?
Are my nose, eyes, and lips still there?

1192
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,605
I can't believe how much you've changed
in the past 15 minutes.

1193

[Is my face still there?]

1194
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:25,168
- Is my face okay?
- No.

1195

My face isn't okay?

1196
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:29,104
No, to be honest, you're
not looking so good right now.

1197
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:32,054
[How absurd.]

1198
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:35,896
Can't you give us a break since
one of us ate the persimmon?

1199
01:19:36,834 --> 01:19:38,452
Then how about...

1200
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,610
Since I already ate Chang Wook's persimmon,
how about we just eat one more?

1201
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:45,194
- Okay, we'll do that.
- I'll just go on by myself.

1202
01:19:45,195 --> 01:19:47,765
I'll go since we already ate yours
and we just need to eat one more.

1203
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,396
- Do you think that you can do it alone?
- I'll try.

1204
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,353
So...

1205
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:02,731
[Giraffe, the lonely persimmon hunter.]

1206
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:04,461
[Thank you, Kwang Soo.]

1207
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:06,623
I got it with my nose!

1208
01:20:06,624 --> 01:20:08,648
Wow, I can't believe that he somehow got it.

1209
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:14,602
No!

I got it with my ear.

1214
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:30,221
[This time, it's with his ear?]

1215
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,573
I can't lose it this time!

1216
01:20:33,574 --> 01:20:35,529
[Good luck, Kwang Soo.]

1217
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,118
I got it!

1218
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:40,954

1219

- I succeeded!
- He ate it. He just succeeded.

01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,906
I succeeded!

1222
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:58,075

Okay, I succeeded.

1226

[The ease of being a pro.]

1233
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,801
I play this game all the time.

1234

I doubt anyone else in this country has
played this game as much as I have.

1235
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,392
You really are very good at it.

1236
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:55,213
- Just give us our three cards.
- Come over this way.

1237
01:21:55,247 --> 01:21:58,282
I'm sorry to ask of this, but
can you please come over to me?

1238
01:21:58,283 --> 01:22:01,418
I'm sorry, but I really beg of you.

1239
01:22:01,419 --> 01:22:03,349
I really wish I could go, too.

1240
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:05,495
[Showing some consideration to
this variety veteran.]

1241
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:10,505
- You just need to select your three cards.
- You pick two, and I'll pick one.

1242
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:12,791
No, you just pick all three.
I can't even get up.

1243
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:15,955
No, you pick the cards.
I'm serious, you pick them.

1244
01:22:17,753 --> 01:22:18,883
Five.

1245
01:22:18,884 --> 01:22:20,571
Is that good, or bad?

1246
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:23,599
Six.

1247
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:27,279
- Are these good numbers?
- We don't know that yet.

1248
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,220
[Unsure of which numbers are
the good ones.]

1249
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:34,197
- This could be good.
- Okay, four, five, and six.

1250
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:37,782

[Final location]

1253
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,082
We have to make a zero, right?

1254
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:01,321
I have a feeling that we're going to have
to end up stealing it from each other.

1255
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:09,532
I think that we're going to have to steal
some number and signs from other teams.

1256
01:23:09,533 --> 01:23:14,781
[The unavoidable truth of having to
compete against one another.]

1257
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:19,136
If you subtract 1468 from 1470,
then you're left with two.

1258
01:23:19,137 --> 01:23:22,704
So if we find another subtraction sign,
then we'll be left with a zero.

1259
01:23:22,705 --> 01:23:25,110
Yes, that's the way to do it.
We both get it, right?

1260
01:23:25,111 --> 01:23:28,160
I think the key to winning this thing
is to find the zero.

1261
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:30,377
- Yes, I think you're right.
- We have to find that zero.

1262
01:23:30,378 --> 01:23:33,280
- Zero and the multiplication sign.
- Yes, that's what we need to find.

1263
01:23:34,103 --> 01:23:36,909
- 1470.
- 1470?

1264
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:43,088
Since we already have 4, 5, and 6...
maybe divide it by 1470?

1265
01:23:47,534 --> 01:23:49,002
I have no idea.

- You should see what we had to do.

So what do we have to do now?

1282

- I've been hearing some rumors.
- We're all very curious right now.
