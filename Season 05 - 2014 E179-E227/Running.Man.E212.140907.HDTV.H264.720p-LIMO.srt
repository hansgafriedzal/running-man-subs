- Ji Hyo made him fall.

163
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,795
[Extremely determined not to travel to
Taiwan to face the punishment.]

164
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,988
Would you like to play another round
if you want to earn some more numbers?

165
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:14,936
One more time!

166
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:19,891
<i>But if Gary and Ailee win again,
then they'll end up earning two numbers.</i>

167
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:23,720
[Everyone unanimously agrees
to play one more round.]

168
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:30,318
[The winning couple of this round
will also earn a number card.]

169
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:39,330
[Please let it be my own partner...]

170
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:50,060
[Everyone in position.]

171
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,526
[Must be fate.]

172
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,125
[Bye, Gary.]

173
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,418
[You can't go, Ailee!
Seulong drops down to the ground.]

174
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,415
[I'm glad it's you!]

175
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,832
[This time, Giraffe kidnaps Big-nose.]

176
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,457
[Yes!
It's lightweight Ji Hyo!]

177
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,046
[It's the Iron Man!]

178
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,255
[Lucky!]

179
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,612
[Running at top speed to avoid
having to face the Taiwan punishment.]

180
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,121
[No matter what she does...
his strength takes over.]

181
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,881
[Chang Wook does his best
to withstand it...]

182
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:54,014
[But ultimately ends up falling down
to the ground once again.]

183
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:58,402
What do you think you're doing!

184
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,244
[We're not facing the punishment!]

185
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,917
[Currently in the lead-
Tiger with Eun Yi on his back.]

186
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:10,822
[Running as if his life is on the line.]

187
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:22,964
[Jae Suk and Sung Jae win.]

188
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,098
[Song Eun Yi ends up getting her Tiger.]

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,579
What luck is this!

190
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,637
- Where were you?
- In the fifth spot. Where were you?

191
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:39,528
- I switched out of that spot!
- What did you do that for!

192
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,500
Why couldn't you get it done?

193
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,187
She's really good at interfering.

194
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,678
I was really shocked at how
good she was.

195
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,553
This round's victory goes to
Lee Sung Jae and Yoo Jae Suk.

196
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,669
[Winners-
Jae Suk, Sung Jae, Gary, Ailee.]

197
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,147
[Able to choose any number of their liking.]

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,685
- He just clung himself onto my back.
- I shouldn't have switched spots.

199
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:06,431
We came in at second place both times.

200
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:09,040
That's too bad, but there's
nothing we can do about it.

201
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:13,265
[Here's to hoping that
you win next time around.]

202
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,831
[The two teams are now trying to decide
which number to pick.]

203
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:23,571
[Each number that they possess will play
a very crucial role in the race.]

204
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,862
There's not much time left
until the flight.

205
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:32,657
What's so important about this race that
you're making all the guests feel so anxious?

206
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:36,585
[1470 Race...
You'll feel even more anxious later on.]

207
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:39,945
- I think we really are going.
- The final mission could be over quickly.

208
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,379
Yes, I'm sure that it won't
take long.

209
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,866
[Gary and Ailee are very cautious
about their number selection.]

210
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,802
<i>Okay, the numbers have been selected.</i>

211
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:53,809
<i>Now that the numbers have been selected,
it's time to start your final mission.</i>

212
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,176
[Time to reveal the final mission.]

213
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,774
<i>The building we will be going into
is Incheon's Children's Museum.</i>

214
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:05,593
<i>Within that building, you will find a variety
of numerical symbols and numbers.</i>

215
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:11,369
<i>You will either have to find the symbols
or steal them from other teams</i>

216
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,648
<i>to form a zero out of the numbers
that your team has in possession.</i>

217
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,778
[Transform 1470 into a zero through
the usage of different numerical symbols.]

218
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,755
<i>Once the time limit is up, the
door leading to the outside will open.</i>

219
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:27,436
<i>Which means that even though you're able
to transform your number into a zero</i>

220
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:30,309
<i>within the time limit of five minutes</i>

221
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,181
<i>it has no meaning until those doors
leading to the outside are opened.</i>

222
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:36,542
<i>You will have to either protect your numbers
or stay hidden until the doors are opened.</i>

223
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:40,776
[A final battle of wits, brains,
and physical strength.]

224
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:48,224
[Which couples will get lucky
and escape the punishment?]

225
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,776
[The final numbers mission.]

226
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,098
[The final destination of where the
mission will take place.]

227
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:02,221
[Each team will be given their numbers
and symbols before entering the building.]

228
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,594
[Gary and Ailee have chosen the number,
one, from having won the previous mission.]

229
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,306
- That's the number we chose.
- What is this?

230
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,659
[Jae Suk and Sung Jae have chosen the number,
'three' from the previous mission.]

231
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,293
Let's see if you'll be having your dinner
in Taiwan or in your own home.

232
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,121
Do you have it?

233
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:29,773
[Time to start the final race.]

234
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:32,334
[Time given- 30 minutes.]

235
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:36,291
[The doors to the building
will now be padlocked.]

236
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:40,166
[Only those who successfully transform
their number into a zero...]

237
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:46,574
[Will be able to escape
this terrifying punishment.]

238
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:50,800
[Current standing of the teams.]

239
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:55,573
[The countdown has begun.]

240
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,540
[A variety of numerical symbols are
hidden throughout the building.]

241
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:08,405
[Must protect the numbers and symbols in hand
and find other needed numbers and symbols.]

242
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:10,609
Shove them down your pants so that
no one can take them away from you.

243
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,125
[Shoving them down his pants.]

244
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,929
I thought you said liked amusement rides,
but I guess you don't want to go to Taiwan?

245
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,433
[This amusement ride maniac seems to
have a change of heart in half a day.]

246
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,878
We have to go find more symbols.

247
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:30,761
Shove them down my pants?
What if it falls out?

248
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:32,573
Inside my pants?

249
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:34,828
[Even the Giraffe starts to shove the numbers
down his pants without any hesitation.]

250
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:37,403
[And eager Chang Wook follows
Kwang Soo's lead in anything he does.]

251
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:40,490
- Not down front, but in the back.
- But what if it falls out?

252
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,647
[Always such a hard worker.]

253
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,559
Just make sure not to have it taken away.

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,248
We need two minus signs,
and one and a five.

255
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,431
It would be awesome if I can find
a multiplication sign.

256
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,328
[Ha Ha is determined to win the race.]

257
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:59,628
[Ha Ha plans on locking his numbers
away in the lockers.]

258
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,773
Does anyone have any change?

259
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,728
[But he doesn't have
100 Won for the locker...]

260
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:11,711
[Plan is to formulate a zero,
then finding a multiplication sign.]

261
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:14,431
Do I need to search in the
trash cans, too?

262
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,456
- Do I need to search in the trash cans, too?
- No.

263
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:22,396
[With such a scary punishment on the line,
all their pride goes out the window.]

264
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:24,712
[Hides their numbers away in a trash can.]

265
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:29,504
- This could be our ticket.
- Ugh, that stinks.

266
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:32,630
[But the punishment they may have to face
is even more frightening than the smell.]

267
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,177
- No one saw that, right?
- Let's keep quiet.

268
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:39,823
[Gary and Ailee only need to find
a couple of signs in order to win.]

269
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,980
Here is what we need.

270
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:48,602
If we divide 1470 by 245,
then we're left with six.

271
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,487
Then we subtract it by six,
and we get our zero.

272
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,491
- So we just need the division sign.
- Really?

273
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:59,086
And we can also just use a minus sign, too.
Diving those numbers will give us a two.

274
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:01,412
Then we just need to subtract two
from it to get our zero.

275
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:06,253
Like you just said, we need
either a division or a minus sign.

276
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,330
To avoid confusing ourselves, let's
talk it out after we find more numbers.

277
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:13,251
I think that would be our best bet.

278
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:19,683
We won't get our taken away,
so let's just keep them in our pants.

279
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:24,048
[Plan- Let's just find as much
as we can.]

280
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:29,437
[Must form a zero no matter what-
Time to start searching.]

281
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,397
You want to do this?
What is it that you need?

282
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:40,614
- Let's help each other out.
- We need a one, a five, and a minus.

283
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:42,517
[We've got it all!]

284
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,246
We don't have any of those.

285
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,469
- What do you guys have?
- We can give you our addition sign.

286
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,337
- You have something you don't need?
- You don't need your addition sign?

287
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,459
- Anything else?
- A seven.

288
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,851
[Such a lie!]

289
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:58,756
- We don't have a seven.
- Keep quiet!

290
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,114
Keep quiet!
Your elder is talking!

291
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:04,166
- Let's go. Negotiation is over.
- What's the matter with you!

292
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,176
[Innocent Chang Wook
doesn't know how to lie.]

293
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,401
- Suk Jin!
- Go away!

294
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,046
[Ah, that was just your plan?]

295
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,395
- We have something you need.
- You almost had me fooled!

296
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:17,520
[Pure of heart, Ji Chang Wook.]

297
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:19,252
Chang Wook is so innocent.

298
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:21,529
I'll give you what you need later.

299
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,500
[Kwang Soo loses his prey
no thanks to Chang Wook.]

300
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,216
What are you going to do about this now?

301
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,794
- What are you going to do about this?
- So this is how you play it?

302
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:30,054
I'm learning from you.

303
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,029
- I'm starting to learn how to play it.
- I may end up smacking you across the face.

304
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,694
We need to find a division sign.

305
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,011
- The division sign is all we need.
- He said there's nothing in here.

306
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:42,129
We've already searched everywhere in here.

307
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,909
[Scheming Kwang Soo and his pupil
follows Ji Hyo into the room.]

308
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,208
What do you need?
We have something we don't need.

309
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,340
- We need a certain symbol.
- We have one that we don't need.

310
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,411
- What do you have?
- A divide, a root, and a plus symbol.

311
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,613
A divide, a root, and a plus symbol.

312
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,651
[Nervous and awkward.]

313
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,815
[Seriously?
You have a divide symbol?]

314
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,265
- Let's see your divide symbol.
- You seriously have one?

315
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,234
Yes, I have it.
I hid it away.

316
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,207
[The pupil is visibly nervous
at Kwang Soo's scheme.]

317
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:14,335
If you don't need the divide symbol,
then why did you hide it away?

318
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,910
[Diverts his gaze away.]

319
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:18,008
I don't believe you, Lee Kwang Soo.

320
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,470
[Second prey smells something foul
and escapes away.]

321
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:22,986
- I don't like the look on your face.
- Hear me out.

322
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:25,653
No, I won't fall for your lies.

323
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:28,120
Hey, Ji Chang Wook.
Are you going to be like this?

324
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,791
[Sorry, Teacher.]

325
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,585
- I really don't think I can lie.
- You have to.

326
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,025
- Then show some reaction, at least.
- How?

327
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,955
At least nod or head or something
instead of that blank look on your face.

328
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,523
- Okay.
- She caught onto us because of you.

329
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:41,930
- Got it?
- Okay.

330
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:46,374
- Next time, you're going to get a spanking.
- 'Yes, we do have that symbol.'

331
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,692
If I say that I have a certain symbol,
then hold it up like this, as if this is it.

332
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:53,991
- What if they ask to see it?
- Don't show it to them.

333
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:59,065
I'm going to have to teach you how to lie.
Think of this as your first lesson.

334
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,154
[How will this pupil fare his lessons?]

335
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:04,181
[Huh?]

336
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,268
[Stops in the middle of his search
to make an imprint of his face?]

337
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,987
[What does Jae Suk's face look like?]

338
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,756
[It's a grasshopper!]

339
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,680
How can this even be possible?

340
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:17,884
[Even he's amazed at his own likeness.]

341
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:24,873
[The time keeps on ticking,
and the terror creeps in closer...]

342
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,609
Skull, go check over there.

343
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,706
We have to keep on running.

344
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:36,648
[Ha Ha and Skull are in need of
'X', '( )' and '-' symbols.]

345
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:42,065
Since the staff members are human beings too,
I'm sure they probably thought similarly.

346
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,042
[Thinking like a hider would.]

347
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:46,183
I have a feeling that it's
around here somewhere.

348
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,638
See?
I knew I'd find something.

349
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,371
[Finds the '( )' symbol that he needs!]

350
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,665
Most people tend to think alike.

351
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:02,010
[His level of confidence shoots up
after finding his first symbol.]

352
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:05,561
I bet there's something here, too.
See?

353
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:09,023
[The 'X' symbol!]

354
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:12,815
[Amazing! Skull is finding
all the symbols that he needs!]

355
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:14,235
Ha Ha!

356
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:17,462
Wait, I can't lose this one.

357
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:20,049
I can't lose this one
even if I lose other symbols.

358
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,339
[Must protect his 'X' symbol.]

359
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,768
Maybe I can avoid having to
go to Taiwan.

360
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,512
I just need to work a little harder.

361
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:28,254
[Ha Ha and Skull are off to a good start.]

362
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:32,369
[Ha Ha is also having good luck
finding his symbols.]

363
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:38,819
[But what is he going to use
the 'root' symbol for?]

364
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,159
- Dong Hoon!
- Where are you?

365
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,039
- Come here, amazing.
- Me, too!

366
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,617
I found the multiplication sign.

367
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,717
['X' and '( )' symbols are found.]

368
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,854
[These two best friends are in
perfect sync with one another.]

369
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,432
Do you have a five?
I have the four and the seven.

370
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,944
We need to find a minus sign
and another same number.

371
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,354
We need to stick together because
we can't have anything stolen away.

372
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:02,060
Wait, do you have 100 Won?

373
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,836
- Why?
- Hurry up and give me the change.

374
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,617
Do you have it?
Okay.

375
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:08,280
Okay, I'll pay you back.
Come with me.

376
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:09,986
[Finally borrows the change he needs.]

377
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:12,895
Let's put these in a locker.

378
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:16,990
[Rushing off to the lockers
that he saw earlier.]

379
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,865
[The key is to protect all the numbers
and the symbols they have on hand.]

380
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:27,411
Put them all in there.

381
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:34,940
[Only locking up the ones they need to keep.]

382
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,080
Remember, locker number 96.

383
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:44,837
[All they need to find now are
a '-' symbol and either 4, 7, or an 8.]

384
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:46,678
We have to find it.

385
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,098
[We can... escape having
to go to Taiwan, right?]

386
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,625
- Tae Woo?
- Yes, Jong Kook?

387
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:55,182
Search over there,
and I'll search over here.

388
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:57,286
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo are
on the search.]

389
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:03,976
[What they still need to find.]

390
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:07,635
[Wow!
Finds the 'X' symbol!]

391
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,433
This is awesome.

392
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:14,257
[Even Mr. Capable is amazed at
his own find.]

393
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:25,622
[Tae Woo finds a plus symbol!]

394
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,783
[And a parenthesis symbol!]

395
00:26:34,784 --> 00:26:37,865
[Amazing! Finding all
the symbols that they need!]

396
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:41,737
[They now just need to find
the number one!]

397
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:43,428
Coming!

398
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:48,766
[Here's another lucky team-
Ha Ha and Skull.]

399
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,819
- Are you having luck finding things?
- What else do you need?

400
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,764
- Us?
- Yes, what do you need?

401
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:57,464
We don't need any help.
We have everything we need already.

402
00:26:57,465 --> 00:27:02,241
- We have a lot of numbers.
- We'll give you what you need.

403
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:04,176
We have a lot of numbers.

404
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,605
[Muscle consumed Sung Jae succeeds
in stealing something!]

405
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,527
You're allowed to do that?

406
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,502
Are you allowed to do that?

407
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:25,186
[But... it's a root symbol.]

408
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,580
Hey, Jae Suk.

409
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:30,082
- I stole one.
- What did you steal?

410
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,516
But it's not something very useful.
It's a root symbol.

411
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,321
- There are too many root symbols around.
- I know.

412
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:36,402
- People are trying to get them taken away.
- Really?

413
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:40,406
Just because you stole something,
they're going to come after you now.

414
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,944
- Come with me.
- Okay, let's stick together.

415
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:45,370
[Darn...]

416
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:49,193
They're going to be mad now, so
they're going to come after you with help.

417
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,070
Do you know what happens then?

418
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,971
You're going to end up losing five just
because you took one away from them.

419
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,007
Don't go around making them angry.

420
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,962
Don't antagonize them.

421
00:27:56,963 --> 00:28:00,510
- You have to stay away from them.
- I didn't know that.

422
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:04,754
- You can't anger them.
- I didn't think he'd be like that.

423
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:06,183
[They're already angry.]

424
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,436
Tell us what you need,
and we'll give it to you.

425
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:11,447
- We have them all hidden away.
- We wouldn't be offering it otherwise.

426
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,390
We have a lot of numbers.
Tell us what you want, and it's yours.

427
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,465
Just give us one number.
Do you have any extras?

428
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:19,164
- Any numbers that you don't need?
- Do you have an eight?

429
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,382
- Eight...
- We don't need an eight.

430
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,311
- Then do you want a four?
- No, we have a four.

431
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,805
You can subtract a four from a four
to get a zero.

432
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,905
[They're going to find us a four?]

433
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,281
See? You could get a zero.
We'll give you a four.

434
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:34,145
- You have a four?
- We'll give you a four.

435
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,897
- But give us either a 5, 7 or an 8.
- If they give us a four...

436
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:39,950
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo would get
their zero with a four.]

437
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,511
- Four minus four is a zero.
- Then we can get our zero.

438
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:46,370
- Multiplying that would give us a zero.
- Okay, deal.

439
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:51,511
[But we want either a seven
or an eight in exchange!]

440
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,846
- We'll give them all to you.
- Do you have an eight?

441
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,511
We can give those to them.

442
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:58,610
[If the exchange is made, then all
Ha Ha and Skull would need is a '-'!]

443
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,263
[It's a win-win situation!]

444
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:04,174
Go stand over there so that
no one else can come in.

445
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,762
[Both teams are excited at the thought
of escaping the scary punishment!]

446
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,761
Okay, we'll see you in a bit.

447
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:12,558
This is awesome.

448
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,874
- It's over.
- We got it.

449
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,002
We can escape having to go to Taiwan
if we play this right.

450
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:22,274
[Will these two be able to escape
the terrorizing punishment?]

451
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,583
If we divide it by four,
then do we get 70?

452
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:36,118
If we divide it by four...
then it's... I don't know.

453
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,111
What if we divide it by seven?

454
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,335
That's... 210.

455
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:49,386
How about if we subtract 213?

456
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:54,647
- Subtract four?
- Yes, subtract it by four.

457
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:56,668
Subtract it by nine?

458
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,549
We need a plus sign.
We need to steal it from someone.

459
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,759
We need to steal it from someone.

460
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,934
[Must steal a '+' symbol!]

461
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,059
We need to steal it.

462
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,834
Ouch, my legs.

463
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:16,211
Dong Hoon, just give me one.
Just give me one number.

464
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:18,563
Suk Jin has a lot of numbers.

465
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:21,477
Suk Jin, just give me one.

466
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:24,121
Can you just give me one number
that you don't need?

467
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,701
- You have yours hidden away somewhere?
- No, Kwang Soo took them away from me.

468
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,360
To Kwang Soo?
You really are something else.

469
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,445
How can I win against two guys?

470
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:38,618
[Gary and Ailee's plan- Beg.]

471
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:42,582
[Ha Ha ultimately hands one over
out of pity for Gary's begging.]

472
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:46,795
Sung Jae took something from us earlier.

473
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:55,622
[While no one else is looking...
Hides it all in the trash can.]

474
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:58,122
People don't search through
filthy trash cans.

475
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,186
I got a parenthesis sign,
and I hid it in the trash can.

476
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:04,724
I just got a parenthesis sign.

477
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:08,677
[All they need now are a '-' and
a 'X' symbol in order to get their zero.]

478
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,359
[Gary, you're the best!]

479
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,673
This isn't a trade,
but we're outright begging.

480
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:15,951
[Please]

481
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:18,797
No, don't pay attention
to what they're doing!

482
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,993
[What is such a big deal
about the amusement ride?]

483
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:23,978
[Their pride has been cast aside
a long time ago already...]

484
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:27,017
[I can't get on that ride
even if my life depended on it.]

485
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:30,067
[A life and death situation for
Ha Ha and Skull.]

486
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:34,296
[The truth is, Jong Kook and Tae Woo
already have everything that they need.]

487
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:39,077
[But trading in their eight for the four
will still make it easier for them.]

488
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,802
[Trade has been made!]

489
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:45,626
[Ha Ha attempts to escape
from the attacking hyenas.]

490
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:48,377
Give me the four.

491
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:51,511
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo succeed
in their mission!]

492
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,031
Give me the parenthesis sign.

493
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:02,638
You take the 'x' symbol,
and I'll take the '( )' symbol.

494
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,479
[Will they be able to hold on
to everything until the end?]

495
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:08,759
Bear and the Tiger.

496
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:14,912
[Prison break?
This team is being attacked!]

497
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:19,538
[Checking on the other numbers and
symbols that they kept hidden away.]

498
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,357
Don't be so nervous.

499
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:26,170
[Both of them are full of nervous energy
like a couple of sinners.]

500
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:30,296
[You really don't want to
get on the ride, do you?]

501
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,940
You're too visible right now.

502
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:37,189
[They successfully have their zero!
Hiding away what they need under the desk.]

503
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,561
Don't film that!
What are you thinking?

504
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,439
- I don't want to go to Taiwan.
- Here they come.

505
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,832
[Okay, we're all set...]

506
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,966
[On the other hand...]

507
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,343
Ji Chang Wook!

508
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:56,505
[Giraffe is being attacked!]

509
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,460
[Ailee eyes her chance and
steals something from Big-nose!]

510
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:06,449
[Everyone's the enemy!]

511
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:09,046
You fool!
How could you have it taken away!

512
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,862
- You don't have anything?
- That's just my body!

513
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:16,602
[Kind of looks like there's something...]

514
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,314
Make your escape!

515
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:24,190
Kwang Soo!

516
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,882
[Save me!]

517
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:30,288
[Seulong joins in on the tussle
from out of nowhere.]

518
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,153
I think this team needs the symbol!

519
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:42,008
[Brain Seulong, steals the '+' symbol.]

520
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,007
[Ji Hyo and Seulong stow away to
a quiet place to get organized.]

521
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,565
[Seulong puts everything that they have
together to calculate what they have.]

522
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:56,154
With these numbers,
we are able to get 1468.

523
00:33:56,155 --> 00:34:02,308
When we add two to that number,
then we get our 1470.

524
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:08,256
Then we subtract the sum of 1468 and
two, which leaves us with our zero.

525
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,003
Okay, we got it.

526
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,308
[Ji Hyo and Seulong get their zero!]

527
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:14,450
You're smart.

528
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:17,164
[Will these two be able to escape
the Taiwan punishment?]

529
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:21,964
[Only five minutes left on the clock.]

530
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,758
Hey, let's make an exchange.

531
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,563
- Come on, let's make an exchange.
- What do you have?

532
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:29,867
You can have either three, seven,
or a nine.

533
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:34,488
We're being very serious.
You can have any of those numbers.

534
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:41,267
- But we don't need any of them.
- Wouldn't it be better to have more numbers?

535
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,580
Then we'll give you our '+' symbol
for two of your numbers.

536
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,839
[Pupil Chang Wook's shocking transformation.]

537
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,486
[Ji Chang Wook-
Graduating as a top pupil.]

538
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:57,815
[Actually, both teams can avoid Taiwan
if they each give up what they don't need.]

539
00:34:57,816 --> 00:35:03,034
[But it is not Running Man's way to give
something up even if they don't need it.]

540
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:06,052
- Wait.
- Let's just make the trade.

541
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,152
Don't just put it down because
they'll just take it.

542
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,476
[That's why he's the master of scheming.]

543
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,161
[Seriously...]

544
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,395
[This is war!]

545
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:34,385
[Did you think that I wouldn't be
able to find you?]

546
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,103
I'm sorry.

547
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:38,699
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking clearly.

548
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,960
- I'm sorry.
- Are you out of your mind?

549
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:44,009
- I'll never do it again, please forgive me.
- Bring me a '+' sign.

550
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,007
- I'm sorry.
- I told you to bring me a '+' sign.

551
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:48,647
[Like a student called into
the principal's office.]

552
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,993
Ji Chang Wook, bring me a '+' sign!

553
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:54,935
Chang Wook!

554
00:35:54,936 --> 00:36:00,277
- How much for the '+' symbol?
- Where are you hiding your things?

555
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:03,810
- Where are you keeping yours hidden?
- You have to carry them around with you.

556
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,235
- This is all we have.
- We already have a nine.

557
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:09,351
Kwang Soo, this is it.

558
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:12,373
[The hyenas exchange glances.]

559
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,274
[Everyone attacks Jae Suk and
Sung Jae together.]

560
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,956
[This is what happens in Running World if you
let down your guard even for a second.]

561
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,732
[Jae Suk is having everything
taken away from him.]

562
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:29,354
[But they end up fighting
amongst themselves as well.]

563
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,806
[Ailee succeeds in stealing something.]

564
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:36,631
[Meanwhile, Chang Wook is separated
from his scheming partner.]

565
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:38,954
Lee Kwang Soo!
Save me!

566
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:42,552
[Chang Wook is being attacked by
Suk Jin and Eun Yi.]

567
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,789
Kwang Soo!

568
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:48,660
You have to hold on!

569
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:52,592
[Only three minutes left on the clock!]

570
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,423
[No more time left to waste!]

571
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,235
[Time for a real battle.]

572
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:05,334
[Gary and Ailee only needs
the '-' symbol in order to succeed.]

573
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:09,096
[But there's no mercy when faced
with the Taiwan punishment.]

574
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:19,172
[But the symbol that falls on Ailee's lap...
The '-' symbol!]

575
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:22,414
[As if dropped from heaven!]

576
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:27,040
[As closing time draws near,
all the couples gets more frantic.]

577
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,976
Put it all together.

578
00:37:30,477 --> 00:37:36,868
[All they need is the '-' symbol that
they just lost to Ailee in order to succeed.]

579
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:39,126
If we play this right,
we may not have to go to Taiwan.

580
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:41,333
We may be able to escape
having to go on the ride.

581
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,959
- You said you wanted to go earlier.
- No, I don't want to go.

582
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,699
[I changed my mind about that
a long time ago...]

583
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,795
I really don't want to go on the ride.

584
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:51,608
I don't want to go to Taiwan
and get on that ride.

585
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,236
I just want to go for the sightseeing.

586
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:56,291
What's the point of us
standing around here like this?

587
00:37:56,925 --> 00:38:01,465
[Did Jong Kook and Tae Woo
go off for a leisurely stroll?]

588
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:05,114
If anyone comes near us, I'm going to
spray them down with the fire extinguisher.

589
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,280
Hey, Skull!
Let's go find Jong Kook.

590
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,810
[After Giraffe gets everyone to agree
to look for Jong Kook and Tae Woo...]

591
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:13,986
[Chang Wook goes off on his own
to calculate what they have.]

592
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:22,029
[Lucky Ailee gets the '-' symbol.]

593
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,935
- How many ones do we have?
- Here's the parenthesis.

594
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:28,024
We have two right now.
We need that one.

595
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:33,258
[As long as they can keep these safe,
they can go home once they get out.]

596
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,293
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi are also busy
calculating what they've got.]

597
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:42,972
[They've got quite a few numbers...]

598
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,437
- Where did our six go?
- Didn't we have it?

599
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:50,060
I thought we had another six.

600
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:57,690
[They have their zero!]

601
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,929
[But they don't even know it!]

602
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,007
[The answer is right in front of them,
but they're not even aware of it.]

603
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,891
- We're in trouble.
- Wait.

604
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,634
- What are we going to do?
- Should we take this out?

605
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:18,006
[Will they be able to figure it out
before their time is up?]

606
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,208
[Meanwhile, Ha Ha and Skull already have
had their answer figured out a while ago.]

607
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,477
[Ha Ha comes back for the numbers
that he had hidden away.]

608
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,814
They're all gone.
What are we going to do?

609
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:36,470
[What in the world happened?]

610
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:41,898
[A little while ago, while everyone went off
searching for Jong Kook and Tae Woo...]

611
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:46,550
[Chang Wook happens to go to the desk
in order to make his own calculations.]

612
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:51,073
[Then...]

613
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:52,478
What is this?

614
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,799
[What is this!]

615
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,001
[Happens across Ha Ha's buried treasure!]

616
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:00,745
- Amazing!
- What is it?

617
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:05,447
I found three!
I think someone had them hidden here.

618
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,040
[The scheming pupil pulls one off!]

619
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:14,298
[A great chance of succeeding the mission!]

620
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:18,977
[A total nightmare for this team.]

621
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:20,317
Skull.

622
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,356
Someone took everything.

623
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:24,695
- Stop kidding around.
- I'm totally serious.

624
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,733
[We're ruined!]

625
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:33,752
[Only one minute left on the clock!]

626
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,935
[Wow, that's where you kept
them hidden?]

627
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,294
[The final minute left on the clock to
avoid having to go to Taiwan!]

628
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:46,555
[This is their last chance!]

629
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,362
Gary.

630
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,207
- I really don't have anything.
- Do you have a '-' symbol?

631
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:56,102
- I really don't have anything.
- Don't lie to me!

632
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,602
[Ailee has it in her hands
and is staying hidden in the room.]

633
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:03,424
I couldn't believe it when I found these.
I just went to calculate our own stuff.

634
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,810
[Oh!
Did they succeed?]

635
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:14,475
[But they're unaware of it...]

636
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:20,546
[Please...]

637
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:26,081
[Please let me go home instead
of having to face the punishment...]

638
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,491
[Time is over.]

639
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,764
[The doors are opened.]

640
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,306
[Once they walk out those doors,
they're in the safe.]

641
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:48,836
[Ji Hyo and Seulong grab their hidden bag
and are the first ones out the door!]

642
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:50,346
Run!

643
00:41:50,347 --> 00:41:52,286
Give me just one!

644
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:56,897
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi are desperate
to find a five.]

645
00:41:56,898 --> 00:42:00,418
[But they find a five
that Blank Ji threw away!]

646
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:06,100
[Just who will be the ones to get
on this hellish ride?]

647
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,637
[Solve the 1470 riddle.]

648
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:15,513
[Get the answer to the riddle on the board
to be able to go home!]

649
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:19,438
Open the bag!

650
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:26,252
Open the bag and get them all on there.

651
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:32,356
[Gary and Ailee- Zero is complete!]

652
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:36,122
[We're going home!]

653
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:38,053
- We're finished!
- We're done!

654
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:45,686
[Ji Hyo and Seulong- Mission cleared.]

655
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:49,036
We're not going to Taiwan!

656
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:52,672
[We get to live!]

657
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:56,064
[It's a real celebration for the survivors.]

658
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:58,008
We did it!

659
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:06,326
[Jong Kook and Tae Woo- Mission cleared!]

660
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:10,526
[Suk Jin and Eun Yi?]

661
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:15,125
Doesn't this work?

662
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,511
- No, it has to be plus five.
- Plus five?

663
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,447
[How can this be?]

664
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:25,514
[Oh my gosh!
Mistakes a '+' for a '-'?]

665
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:31,862
[Have everything they need,
but still can't figure it out...]

666
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:34,174
How about we fix this symbol?

667
00:43:36,544 --> 00:43:41,348
[Have Kwang Soo and Chang Wook
figured it out?]

668
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:49,744
[They still haven't figured it out...]

669
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:02,588
[Just then, Chang Wook seems to
have figured something out.]

670
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,915
Where did our '( )' symbol go?

671
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,734
- We just gave that away.
- Ah!

672
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:14,091
[They gave the '( )' symbol away?]

673
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:18,668
[Final trade made by all the teams
right before the time ran out.]

674
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:20,598
No, we don't need that.

675
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,890
[Just gave the '( )' away,
thinking they wouldn't need it.]

676
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:26,731
We couldn't figure this out when
we had the '( )' symbol in hand.

677
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:29,467
We just gave the symbol away  to Dong Hoon
thinking that we wouldn't need it.

678
00:44:29,468 --> 00:44:33,956
[It's already water under the bridge...]

679
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:36,850
- This is all I was thinking about.
- We didn't think of that earlier.

680
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:38,716
[The scheming brothers' unfortunate mistake.]

681
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,877
- We just needed a '-' symbol.
- We don't need any of this.

682
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:44,520
[If they only had the '-' symbol...]

683
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,905
[Too bad...]

684
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:50,499
Dong Hoon.

685
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:56,644
[A '-' symbol is needed,
so attempts to transform '=' into a '-'.]

686
00:44:58,178 --> 00:44:59,579
Let's just go.

687
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:09,843
[Escapes punishment- Gary and Ailee;
Ji Hyo and Seulong; Jong Kook and Tae Woo.]

688
00:45:09,844 --> 00:45:13,012
[Envious...]

689
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:18,169
<i>Those of you standing on stage are
free to go home right now.</i>

690
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,223
[Gets to go home right away!]

691
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:24,445
- Tae Woo, you can go home.
- Are they really going home?

692
00:45:25,586 --> 00:45:32,762
[And... we're going to Taiwan?]

693
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:38,400
[Mommy, don't wait up for me...]

694
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,147
Sorry, Jae Suk!

695
00:45:40,148 --> 00:45:42,614
[The winners leave to go home with
a bounce in their steps.]

696
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,853
Then I'll be heading home early.

697
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:47,873
[What a sweet ending it is...]

698
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:52,793
At times, moments like this is what
determines the outcome of one's life.

699
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:56,904
[Goodbye.]

700
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,198
It's been a while since the jail-timers
have gathered around like this.

701
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,031
- We're the original regulars in jail.
- I don't feel so alone.

702
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:16,224
As for the rest of you,
please be on your way.

703
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:19,854
Stop looking at it, Chang Wook!
It's all over!

704
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:23,513
[Do I really have to go on the ride?]

705
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:27,161
That's just absurd.

706
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,862
[The terrifying punishment
they now have to face.]

707
00:46:31,273 --> 00:46:34,702
[Terror of unimaginable proportions
and the hidden secret behind it.]

708
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:38,499
[And also...]

709
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,899
[A trial that Running Man members
will now have to face.]

710
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,348
<i>You only think of yourself, don't you?</i>

711
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:49,012
[Six actresses and their harsh fate...]

712
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:53,689
<i>- You've hurt me even worse, you jerk!
- You make me feel filthy!</i>

713
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:59,737
[Where is this all headed?]

714
00:46:59,738 --> 00:47:02,191
<i>- Can't be!
- Stop obsessing over Song Ji Hyo!</i>

715
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:04,739
I want you to love me!

716
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,243
[Coming soon.]

717
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:11,026
[Off to Taiwan to face their punishment.]

718
00:47:12,702 --> 00:47:16,641
[Incheon International Airport.]

719
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:27,222
[The seven members, who
have failed to succeed their mission.]

720
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:33,176
[Off to face their frightening punishment
with a cheer from their fans.]

721
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:44,015
I'll be back.
I love you, Taiwan.

722
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,786
[Taiwan- Size of Taipei- 35.980km with
the population of 23.36 million people.]

723
00:47:59,787 --> 00:48:05,296
[A food lovers' paradise where the culture
coexists side by side with nature.]

724
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:11,686
[August 2014- Taiwan's 'L' Resort.]

725
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:15,471
[The fateful day is here.]

726
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:21,156
Is it recording?

727
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:24,296
[Skull's self-cam.]

728
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,691
Good morning from Taiwan.

729
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,671
What am I doing in Taiwan right now?

730
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:34,665
I just came to guest on Running Man,
but here I am in Taiwan this morning.

731
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:38,514
Isn't this room...

732
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:41,258
so messy?

733
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:43,425
This is my room.

734
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:47,562
Oh my goodness,
what a mess from my shower.

735
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,961
Let's go check out other members' rooms.

736
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,565
Let's start with Ha Ha's room.

737
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,947
[Off to his best friend, Ha Ha's room.]

738
00:48:56,948 --> 00:48:59,779
Ha Ha went to bed late last night
and his room is still locked.

739
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,224
- Hello.
- Let's go have breakfast.

740
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:07,868
[Good morning, Big-nose
and good morning, Kwang Soo.]

741
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,314
[Haroro doesn't seem to be
quite awake yet.]

742
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:15,527
Turn on the lights.
Let's see what you look like.

743
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:19,543
- Yeah, Kwang Soo.
- I woke up about three hours ago.

744
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:24,134
I read the paper with a cup of coffee
after my morning run.

745
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,114
You look like you just woke up.

746
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:28,591
Dong Hoon.

747
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:31,629
I'm still half asleep.

748
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,775
[Kwang Soo's morning raspberry.]

749
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,024
I said, knock it off.

750
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:54,208
Wow, this is a zoo!

751
00:49:56,491 --> 00:50:06,056
[Outside their room window...
is a real zoo!]

752
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:14,211
[Right in front of the lawn are giraffes,
rhinos, and a variety of other wild beasts!]

753
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,472
- Good morning, Sung Jae.
- Did you sleep well last night?

754
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,333
What time did you get up?
Are you all ready to go?

755
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:22,985
[Sung Jae is ready to go and already
enjoying his morning cup of coffee.]

756
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:27,078
[Giving Sung Jae the tour
of the zoo out in the front lawn.]

757
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:29,430
The world really is a fascinating place.

758
00:50:29,431 --> 00:50:31,979
- What is that, a rhino?
- This is a zoo!

759
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:35,166
Isn't this amazing?

760
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,701
There are a total of three
Kwang Soo's here.

761
00:50:40,227 --> 00:50:42,253
It's like a real safari.

762
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:55,551
[Giraffe from Namyang... is trying to
communicate with giraffe from Taiwan.]

763
00:50:58,453 --> 00:50:59,789
Come here.

764
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:02,889
Come here, it's me.

765
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,784
[What a weird Giraffe.]

766
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:09,824
[Feels that it needs to avoid
the weird Giraffe.]

767
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:11,085
Don't go!

768
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:12,532
No!

769
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:16,116
Don't go back to him!
No!

770
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:18,631
I vow that I'll get my revenge!

771
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,776
I think the zebra's legs are too short.

772
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:27,208
I've seen some dwarf horses before,
but I've never seen a dwarf zebra before.

773
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,078
I think it's a cross breed between
a dwarf horse and a zebra.

774
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,241
It's because of the global warming,
and the pollution issue.

775
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:34,361
- That is?
- Yeah.

776
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:36,501
It's a degradation of the ecosystem.

777
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:40,917
You got 'degradation of the ecosystem'
just from seeing that zebra?

778
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:45,617
I'm not the one being weird, but
you're saying all sorts of weird things.

779
00:51:45,618 --> 00:51:50,260
It's because you're nervous, isn't it?
You lied about liking those rides, didn't you?

780
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:53,191
- Yes, I do like my rides.
- If you do, then why are you being so weird?

781
00:51:54,817 --> 00:52:04,441
[Now that we think about it,
the reason why we're even here...]

782
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:10,724
[is to face our terrorizing punishment.]

783
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:14,730
[That is the ultimate climax
of the 1470 Race.]

784
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:19,638
Are we really getting on that scary ride?

785
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:24,257
I heard that the punishment that we're
going to have to face is just unreal.

786
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:26,075
[The rumor can't even begin to describe
the extent of the terror.]

787
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:29,639
[The absolute terror of the punishment
that they will soon have to face.]

788
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,109
[And what is the secret hidden
behind the punishment?]

789
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:43,605
[The squad gathers together to get
ready to face their punishment.]

790
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,096
- Is that it?
- Good morning.

791
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:51,833
[They just can't seem to
tear their eyes away.]

792
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:55,373
- I think you it goes up and down.
- Is it connected?

793
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:58,063
It's those two tips over there.

794
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:01,860
It's perpendicular.
It's totally perpendicular to each other.

795
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:05,412
[A deep sigh...]

796
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:08,651
Welcome to Taiwan.

797
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:16,102
- Why did we have to come to Taiwan for this?
- Is this really worth the trip?

798
00:53:16,103 --> 00:53:20,376
I thought that was an apartment tower
off in the distance.

799
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:23,131
That's the kind of thing you see
when an apartment is being built.

800
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:25,270
- That's an amusement ride?
- That's the ride.

801
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:29,192
- You'll see once you get there.
- I'm sorry I couldn't make the zero.

802
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:31,013
I had no idea that it was going to
warrant such a huge punishment.

803
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:34,410
- I'll make the zero from now on.
- I will make sure to make the zero.

804
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,762
[An unimaginable level of tragedy from
having failed the 1470 Race?]

805
00:53:37,763 --> 00:53:39,273
What if I can't ride it?
Then can I sit it out?

806
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:41,784
Or we can play another game amongst ourselves
and have the loser ride it for everyone?

807
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,834
No!

808
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:46,037
- Wow, that's really scary.
- Let's go.

809
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,020
[Off to where the punishment will take place
with heavy steps.]

810
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:03,370
It's been a real long time since the bus
has been this quiet with the cameras rolling.

811
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:05,743
Everyone has this
ambiguous look on their faces

812
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:09,653
because they're unable to smile,
but they don't want to frown either.

813
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:12,156
See?
That's the ride.

814
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:15,231
- That's just absurd!
- Is that really one ride?

815
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:18,343
[Why is it that we've never been wrong
when it comes to things like this?]

816
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:21,799
Lee Sung Jae looks the most relaxed
out of all of us here right now.

817
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,409
He thought he wanted to come here,
but he said he's changed his mind.

818
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,353
- Do you like rides like this?
- Yes, I do.

819
00:54:28,354 --> 00:54:31,400
But I've noticed that many actors
like to put up a false front.

820
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,904
I know that he says he's okay with it,
but let's see what he looks like later on.

821
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,984
- You saw me on the ride yesterday, right?
- Of course, I did.

822
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:40,208
You were cursing out loud.

823
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:44,139
- You were totally cursing out loud.
- You looked really scared yesterday.

824
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:52,021
[Actor, Sung Jae... his expression was
enough to express the fear he felt.]

825
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:57,192
I was just showing my respect
to the ride I was on.

826
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,510
I really can't tell if he's
telling the truth or not.

827
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:02,021
[Such a realistic sounding bluff.]

828
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:06,350
Sung Jae, just admit that you're scared.

829
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,788
All our members will be the first
to admit when we're scared.

830
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:14,332
- Chang Wook, you're scared too, aren't you?
- Yes.

831
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,906
I can tell that he's scared because
he just took a deep breath.

832
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:20,702
- What about you?
- My mind is just blank right now.

833
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:25,446
- Just be honest with us.
- He's not good on rides either.

834
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:29,973
[Finally arrives at the site
of their punishment.]

835
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,411
[Very heavy footsteps.]

836
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:45,206
[The fear keeps on closing in.]

837
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,228
I want to run away from here.

838
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:50,137
I want to make everyone faint
and just go back home.

839
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,925
If we would've just helped each other,
then none of us would've had to come here.

840
00:55:53,926 --> 00:55:58,232
[Had we known this was going to happen,
we would've just helped each other...]

841
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,089
If we had just exchanged
whatever we didn't need.

842
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:05,533
- Why is a king acting so nervous?
- I'm really bad on these rides.

843
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,588
You really are so honest about
everything.

844
00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:10,889
- That's the way to be.
- So I'm the only one who's good with rides?

845
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,072
You're not good on rides!

846
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:15,484
You're just pretending like you are
when in fact, you're not.

847
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,195
I can finally see it up close.

848
00:56:18,196 --> 00:56:21,721
[Time to face their fears.]

849
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:27,175
Oh my, I can't go!

850
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,357
- What are you doing?
- Over my dead body!

851
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,476
- Just walk over me!
- I can't go any further.

852
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:35,356
[Seeing it up close
is paralyzing them with fear.]

853
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:37,997
This really is unbelievable.

854
00:56:39,715 --> 00:56:41,564
I already feel sick to my stomach.

855
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,973
[A warning signal starts to go off.]

856
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:50,555
[1470 Race- The final punishment.]

857
00:56:54,379 --> 00:57:03,787
[Screaming Condor- Terrorizing rollercoaster
that is known all around the world.]

858
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,288
- Why didn't you make the zero?
- You're the one who lost it for us!

859
00:57:08,078 --> 00:57:11,906
[The moment where they resent each
other for having to come here.]

860
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:20,190
Wow, I've never had to go down to
the basement to go on a ride before.

861
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:30,878
[This is the final and ultimate punishment
that the losers of 1470 Race must face.]

862
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,223
- I bet the front seat is the scariest.
- Are we all riding it together?

863
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:39,173
We're not, are we?

864
00:57:39,174 --> 00:57:42,054
[Half their sanity
is already out the window.]

865
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:47,434
As you all are already aware,
this is the most famous ride in Taiwan.

866
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:52,124
With the height of 56m,
and the speed of 105km per hour.

867
00:57:52,546 --> 00:57:57,139
You will have a group mission to complete,
rather than just a team mission.

868
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,743
<i>You will have a group mission to complete.</i>

869
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:03,046
[What?
A mission?]

870
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,859
There's another mission?

871
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,885
If you succeed on your first try,
then you get to go home right away.

872
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:11,679
[Absolutely ridiculous!]

873
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,491
Let's just go home!

874
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,785
- They tricked us!
- Are you kidding me!

875
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,750
- It's a very simple mission.
- Riding it just once is hard enough.

876
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:23,741
Do you see the two 'R' flags on
the posts on either side?

877
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,149
You just need to look at the flags
on those two posts.

878
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,251
All you have to do is correctly guess
the number written below the flags.

879
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:34,718
- It's another number mission.
- You like these rides, don't you?

880
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,559
Okay, I'll do it.

881
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,163
- Chang Wook, you can sit up front.
- I can't believe there's a mission.

882
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:43,181
You didn't tell us that
there was going to be a mission!

883
00:58:43,182 --> 00:58:46,837
- Suk Jin is seriously angry.
- Seriously!

884
00:58:46,872 --> 00:58:51,158
[Big-nose explodes in rage.]

885
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:53,300
First, you must decide
where you're going to sit.

886
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:56,130
It's two people per row.

887
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,202
- Want to sit up front with me?
- Yes, go sit.

888
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:05,540
[Jae Suk is shoved forward to
be chosen to sit in the front row.]

889
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,924
- Why did you shove me?
- You'll be safe with me.

890
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:11,629
[Extreme state of nervousness
right from the moment of seat selection.]

891
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:17,439
- Let's get this done in first try.
- Think of your parents and your children.

892
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,077
- Let's get this done.
- Get it done on our first try!

893
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:22,269
[Let's get this done!]

894
00:59:23,038 --> 00:59:27,797
[We'll get it done on our first try!
We are united as one!]

895
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,558
- Chang Wook, get yourself together!
- You have to pull yourself together.

896
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,043
You can't lose your
sanity right now, Chang Wook.

897
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:36,656
- Chang Wook, pull yourself together.
- We have to work together as one.

898
00:59:36,691 --> 00:59:40,608
I suggest that for this mission,
we forget our formalities.

899
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:43,217
Yoo Jae Suk, pull yourself together!

900
00:59:43,218 --> 00:59:45,757
- Okay, I will.
- Everyone pull yourselves together!

901
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:47,528
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Pull yourself together!

902
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:50,884
You'd better seriously
pull yourself together.

903
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:53,170
- Do you hear me?
- You dare to shake me?

904
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:55,583
Lee Sung Jae.
Pull yourself together.

905
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:57,237
[This time, it's time to tell Sung Jae
to pull himself together.]

906
00:59:57,238 --> 00:59:59,478
Chang Wook, you do it too.
Do it to me.

907
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:00,900
- Jae Suk...
- Do it.

908
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,500
Pull yourself together.

909
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,847
Listen to me, Yoo Jae Suk!

910
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:07,235
Ji Suk Jin!
Pull yourself together right now.

911
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,471
[Dropping formalities isn't an easy feat
for this polite and sweet young actor.]

912
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,141
Tell Lee Sung Jae to pull
himself together.

913
01:00:11,142 --> 01:00:13,518
[But this is my senior, Lee Sung Jae...]

914
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,595
[But no one is exempt from this moment.]

915
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:19,200
Lee Sung Jae, pull yourself together!

916
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:20,701
[Lee Sung Jae, pull yourself together!]

917
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:25,007
[Okay, I'll pull myself together...]

918
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:27,422
You bastard! You'd better
do a good job, you bastard!

919
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,124
Do you hear me!

920
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:32,902
How do you think this makes me feel,
you bastard!

921
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:34,652
[A passionate round of cheers
for everyone in the group.]

922
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:37,242
- I can't believe...
- Lee Sung Jae.

923
01:00:37,243 --> 01:00:40,501
Lee Sung Jae,
stop bluffing and take a good look.

924
01:00:40,502 --> 01:00:44,075
- Stop bluffing, do you hear me?
- Wow, he's such a good actor.

925
01:00:45,072 --> 01:00:47,483
[This actor truly is a master
when it comes to acting.]

926
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:48,586
Donte afraid.

927
01:00:48,587 --> 01:00:52,156
If you're feeling afraid, then
start slapping each other like this.

928
01:00:52,157 --> 01:00:55,718
[A cheerful round of slapping to
help alleviate some of their fear.]

929
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,502
Lee Sung Jae, pull yourself together.

930
01:00:57,503 --> 01:01:04,231
[If they could only transform
their fear into courage...]

931
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:13,352
[Cheer going a bit overboard.]

932
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:18,292
[Transforming their fear into rage.]

933
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:20,151
I'm not afraid!

934
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,345
[These guys are so weird...]

935
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,736
Pull yourself together!

936
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:35,868
Is everyone ready?

937
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:39,305
- You can get it done on your first try.
- We'll get it done on our first try!

938
01:01:39,306 --> 01:01:41,416
Yes, you really can do that.

939
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:47,306
[His bravery is crumbled
by a tiny little bee.]

940
01:01:48,703 --> 01:01:51,748
- You guys are driving me crazy.
- Let's get it done on our first try.

941
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:58,496
[Will this cowardly group of men be able to
successfully complete the mission?]

942
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:05,266
[Time to board the ride.]

943
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:07,458
[This portion of show was safely filmed thanks
to the help and cooperation from Taiwan.]

944
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:10,309
[First row- Jae Suk and Sung Jae.]

945
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:18,903
[Second row- Chang Wook and Kwang Soo.]

946
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:29,479
My legs are just dangling.
Is there a footrest?

947
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,379
Is there a footrest?

948
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:38,596
[Third row- Skull and Ha Ha.]

949
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:44,162
[Fourth row- Big nose.]

950
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:45,827
No, no, no!

951
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,504
[It's okay, it's automatically
going to tighten up.]

952
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,387
Please.

953
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,480
I'm sweating bullets.

954
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:57,346
[Already soaked down with sweat
before the ride even starts.]

955
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,953
- We only have one chance!
- Think of this as our final chance!

956
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:05,134
<i>Pull yourself together, Ji Suk Jin!</i>

957
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:08,999
<i>Pull yourself together, Ji Suk Jin!
Pull yourself together, Lee Sung Jae!</i>

958
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,535
<i>Pull yourself together, Ji Chang Wook!
Pull yourself together, Ha Dong Hoon!</i>

959
01:03:12,536 --> 01:03:16,604
<i>Pull yourself together, Skull!
Pull yourself together, Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

960
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:24,266
[At the speed of 105km per hour.]

961
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:29,237
[And the height of 56m.]

962
01:03:29,646 --> 01:03:35,496
[Conquer all your fears...]

963
01:03:35,497 --> 01:03:38,137
[And check the number beneath the flags.]

964
01:03:38,138 --> 01:03:41,082
Please!
Concentrate!

965
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:48,080
[Will they be able to conquer their fears
to successfully complete the mission?]

966
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:54,423
[1470 Race- The final mission.]

967
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:56,229
[Go!]

968
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:03,885
[Starts off at an unbelievable speed!]

969
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:16,654
[As soon as the ride takes off,
the numbers are attached to the posts.]

970
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:19,774
[Mission numbers- Nine and Five.]

971
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:24,483
[Off to a fast start.]

972
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:31,082
[A 90 degree climb.]

973
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:48,524
[A complete out of body experience.]

974
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,583
[Giraffe's fear has been transformed
into feelings of rage.]

975
01:04:52,776 --> 01:04:54,988
I can't do this.

976
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:59,868
[Skyrockets into the sky.]

977
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:03,842
[At zero gravity.]

978
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:10,417
[What... a perfect day to be riding on
a rollercoaster.]

979
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:17,511
[And a dead drop back down
to the ground.]

980
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:21,030
What the hell is this!

981
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,434
[Sucked back down backwards!]

982
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:30,850
[Passes by the mission numbers
at top speed.]

983
01:05:32,163 --> 01:05:34,119
[Father Big-nose is asleep
with his mouth hanging wide open.]

984
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:43,037
[This time, they're pulled back up
backwards at a 90 degree angle.]

985
01:05:51,332 --> 01:05:54,369
[Seven octaves of screaming.]

986
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:01,985
[Facing the ground while hanging in midair.]

987
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:06,842
[Pulled backwards as if pulled back
by a taut bow.]

988
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:09,755
[And falls back down
to the ground at top speed.]

989
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:16,353
[Falling at the speed of 105km per hour.]

990
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:21,845
[Will they even be able to see the numbers?]

991
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:28,835
[Even with their eyes wide open, the
numbers are flashing by at 105km an hour.]

992
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:42,665
[Big-nose is in the REM cycle of his sleep.]

993
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:48,660
[Sung Jae screams out
at the top of his lungs.]

994
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:57,393
[But still manages to keep
his eyes wide open.]

995
01:06:58,702 --> 01:07:01,663
[Has Skull passed out with
his eyes wide open?]

996
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:12,952
Mommy!

997
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,493
How are we going to do the mission!

998
01:07:36,588 --> 01:07:40,598
[Comes to a sudden and an abrupt stop.]

999
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:47,438
[Father, it's all over now.
It's time to wake up.]

1000
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,267
Did you see the numbers?

1001
01:07:54,997 --> 01:07:57,642
[The Giraffe is dry heaving.]

1002
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,798
We can't do this!

1003
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:04,531
[I... survived...]

1004
01:08:05,726 --> 01:08:09,332
[Unable to stop
the frantic beating of their hearts.]

1005
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,738
Is everyone okay?

1006
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:21,161
- Are you okay?
- I thought...

1007
01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:25,534
I thought we were slowly going to go
back and fall back down like this.

1008
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,493
I really can't go back on that thing.

1009
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:29,081
This is over.

1010
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:33,709
Okay, it's time to verify the answer.
Did you get to see the numbers?

1011
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,476
We'll start with Kwang Soo.
Please step forward.

1012
01:08:36,477 --> 01:08:38,203
[Starts with Kwang Soo to verify
the answer.]

1013
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,489
- Here's your question.
- Okay.

1014
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:45,191
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1015
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:46,679
[What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?]

1016
01:08:47,889 --> 01:08:54,635
[Nine and Five.
The answer is, 45.]

1017
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:58,357
45.

1018
01:08:58,358 --> 01:09:01,841
[Kwang Soo saw the numbers!
Succeeds the mission.]

1019
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,410
Kwang Soo, please don't share your answer.

1020
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,774
[Chang Wook's turn.]

1021
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:08,216
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1022
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:10,511
45.

1023
01:09:10,512 --> 01:09:13,215
[Chang Wook saw it too!
Succeeds the mission.]

1024
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:15,714
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1025
01:09:15,715 --> 01:09:16,967
45.

1026
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:19,599
[Sung Jae also succeeds the mission.]

1027
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,122
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1028
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:24,156
[Nervous...]

1029
01:09:24,157 --> 01:09:25,732
45.

1030
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:27,515
Okay, Yoo Jae Suk.

1031
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:29,343
[Big-brother manages to see what he
needs even through his REM cycle.]

1032
01:09:29,344 --> 01:09:31,468
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1033
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,785
45.

1034
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:36,913
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1035
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:38,092
45.

1036
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:41,147
[Jae Suk and Skull
also succeeds the mission.]

1037
01:09:41,148 --> 01:09:46,497
[Ha Ha is the only one left remaining.]

1038
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,932
What do you get when you
multiply the two numbers?

1039
01:09:49,933 --> 01:09:51,209
[If Ha Ha correctly guesses the answer,
then it's a mission success.]

1040
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:55,112
I seriously couldn't even open my eyes
because I was so scared.

1041
01:09:57,325 --> 01:10:02,798
[Ha Ha kept his eyes tightly closed
during the whole ride.]

1042
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,367
I just heard about the five, but I
don't know what the other number is.

1043
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,949
<i>I just heard about the five,
but I don't know what the other number is.</i>

1044
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:14,125
[What?
You didn't hear?]

1045
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:19,458
[What? Then do we
have to go back on that thing?]

1046
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:21,864
In that case...

1047
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:26,540
[They fail the mission because of
Ha Ha having kept his eyes closed.]

1048
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,559
Since Ha Ha didn't see the numbers,
you'll have to get back on the ride.

1049
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,863
[It's back on the ride for everyone.]

1050
01:10:33,815 --> 01:10:35,410
Look!

1051
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:41,991
I really think that the front row
is the scariest spot to be sitting.

1052
01:10:43,518 --> 01:10:45,589
Shout out loud what the numbers are.

1053
01:10:45,897 --> 01:10:49,377
When you first start,
this is what it sounds like.

1054
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,737
[How it sounds on the way up,
and how it sounds on the way down.]

1055
01:10:51,738 --> 01:10:56,289
[How are they going to scream out the number
when they're too busy screaming?]

1056
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,502
The rest of us all got it right!

1057
01:10:58,503 --> 01:11:00,928
- Then let's just live here!
- What did you say?

1058
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,165
[What else can I do about it
when I can't even open my eyes!]

1059
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:07,335
- Okay, select where you're going to sit.
- Chang Wook, was it tolerable for you?

1060
01:11:07,336 --> 01:11:08,783
- What?
- Was it tolerable for you?

1061
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:12,310
- I seriously couldn't open my eyes.
- I didn't open my eyes once either.

1062
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:17,489
I thought it would be worse to close my eyes,
so I couldn't even blink my eyes.

1063
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,377
Then sit up front.
You can sit up front, right?

1064
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:21,710
[How can you even say such a thing to me?]

1065
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:23,920
Then sit up front.
You can sit up front, right?

1066
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:26,084
Why are you soaked in sweat?

1067
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:29,295
- Maybe he was really scared.
- I think he was really scared.

1068
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,361
But you know what he said to me
the moment we got off?

1069
01:11:31,362 --> 01:11:34,180
<i>'That wasn't even that scary.'</i>

1070
01:11:34,181 --> 01:11:36,070
[He can't stop his bluffing
even through all that sweat.]

1071
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:39,104
- It's because you're scared.
- This ride is terrifying!

1072
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:41,468
- Why am I the only person sweating?
- You're covered in cold sweat.

1073
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:43,637
[No kidding.]

1074
01:11:43,672 --> 01:11:47,282
Lee Sung Jae,
just admit it if you're scared.

1075
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:49,269
Stop breaking out in cold sweats like that.

1076
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:52,092
- I'm not scared.
- Look at all the sweat covering your arms!

1077
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:57,006
Wow, he is like the master of bluffing.

1078
01:11:57,007 --> 01:11:58,784
He sweated more than any one of us
but he keeps insisting that he's not scared.

1079
01:11:58,785 --> 01:12:00,982
I'm not scared.
That's why I rode in the front row.

1080
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,999
You look to the left,
and you look to the right, okay?

1081
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:06,543
[Look to the right... okay!]

1082
01:12:07,398 --> 01:12:09,140
Okay, please get back on the ride.

1083
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:12,139
[Punishment mission- Second attempt.]

1084
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,632
Why am I the only one sweating like this?

1085
01:12:15,633 --> 01:12:19,316
Sung Jae, that's cold sweat
because you're nervous and scared.

1086
01:12:20,324 --> 01:12:22,517
- This is fun.
- You think this is fun?

1087
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,363
Yes, it's fun.

1088
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,099
Wow, we have to get it done
no matter what.

1089
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,835
I'll try to keep my eyes open.

1090
01:12:31,836 --> 01:12:34,773
I seriously can't do this again.
Over my dead body!

1091
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:39,693
[Punishment mission- Second attempt.]

1092
01:12:39,694 --> 01:12:41,036
Fighting!

1093
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:42,932
Wow, this is so scary.

1094
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:43,935
[Front row- Once again,
Jae Suk and Sung Jae.]

1095
01:12:44,785 --> 01:12:47,577
[Second row- Ha Ha and Kwang Soo.]

1096
01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:52,243
[Third row- Skull and Chang Wook.]

1097
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:56,030
[Fourth row- Father Big nose.]

1098
01:12:57,336 --> 01:13:00,107
[Loosening up his mouth to
prepare himself for all the screaming.]

1099
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:07,155
[Punishment mission- Second attempt.]

1100
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,751
[There will not be another failure!]

1101
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:19,051
[It's just as fast the second time around!]

1102
01:13:19,052 --> 01:13:22,517
[But their expressions are
looking even more stiff!]

1103
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:30,139
[This time around,
the number are, four and seven.]

1104
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:44,036
[Kwang Soo's owl-eyed plan fails.]

1105
01:13:44,531 --> 01:13:47,462
[Father Big-nose is talking in his sleep.]

1106
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:56,546
Please!
Look at the numbers!

1107
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:01,846
[Will everyone see the numbers
this time around?]

1108
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:05,943
[Ha Ha's hawk like gaze.]

1109
01:14:12,422 --> 01:14:14,715
[I'm going to see the numbers
even if it kills me!]

1110
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,663
It's four and seven!

1111
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:24,845
Four!

1112
01:14:24,846 --> 01:14:28,068
[Four!
Chang Wook's desperate shout out.]

1113
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:32,049
[But the front row is too busy
screaming to hear Chang Woo's pleas.]

1114
01:14:32,627 --> 01:14:35,554
[At the maximum speed.]

1115
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:39,161
Seven!

1116
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:41,986
Seven!

1117
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:44,193
[Current speed- Over 105km an hour.]

1118
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:09,036
[But they seemed to have seen the numbers
the second time around.]

1119
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:14,893
[Everyone's shouting out the numbers that
they saw at the top of their lungs.]

1120
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:19,379
[But unable to comprehend due
to all the blood curdling screams.]

1121
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,621
Four!

1122
01:15:26,806 --> 01:15:29,129
[Even father's eyes are wide open.]

1123
01:15:34,053 --> 01:15:35,885
Four!

1124
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:54,234
Seven times four is twenty-eight!

1125
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:00,321
I saw it!

1126
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:02,806
I saw it!

1127
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:05,983
[An amazing transformation
compared to their first attempt.]

1128
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:14,442
- I saw it!
- I saw it.

1129
01:16:14,443 --> 01:16:16,952
Mission... success!

1130
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:23,419
[Completely soaked in sweat.]

1131
01:16:26,453 --> 01:16:32,626
[I can't get back on this ride again.]

1132
01:16:37,853 --> 01:16:39,709
I feel a little nauseous.

1133
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:42,945
I can't ride that for the third time.

1134
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:45,155
Riding it two times in a row
has me feeling nauseous.

1135
01:16:45,156 --> 01:16:47,302
Just admit that you were scared.

1136
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,904
- No, it's not that.
- He keeps expressing his fear in other ways.

1137
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:53,786
- He's now saying that he's feeling queasy.
- What's wrong with you?

1138
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,561
- You're sweatier than any one of us.
- Just admit that you're scared.

1139
01:16:57,562 --> 01:16:59,426
Riding it two times in a row
has me feeling nauseous.

1140
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:02,092
You all know what the numbers are, right?

1141
01:17:02,093 --> 01:17:04,946
- I saw it.
- I saw it with both my eyes.

1142
01:17:04,947 --> 01:17:08,040
- I saw both the numbers.
- I didn't see the one on the right.

Did you see how Chang Wook
was glaring at him?

- He's lying.
- He screamed out the answer.

01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,312
How was I supposed to hear him
when I was busy screaming myself?

1156
01:17:55,313 --> 01:17:56,928

What do you get
when you add up the two numbers?

1160
01:18:06,031 --> 01:18:07,605
Eleven.

1161
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,977
I'll ask Lee Sung Jae last.
Okay, Ha Ha's turn.

1162

What do you get
when you add up the two numbers?

1163

The question is different.

[The can succeed the mission only if
Sung Jae can correctly answer the question.]

1172

- Please don't lie to us.
- Seriously, don't lie to us.

1173

then they have to get back on the ride.]

[What was Sung Jae's answer?]

1178
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:19,529
[If Sung Jae fails, then they
must all get back on the ride.]

1179
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:23,066
I just guessed the other number.

1180
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:26,257
- What were the two numbers?
- Four and seven.

1181
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:28,683
- Four and what?
- Seven.

[Their love for Taiwan hasn't even
been explored yet.]

Are we seriously just going
to go home?

1200
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:28,726
Because we were all so consumed by
our fear for this ride

1201
01:20:28,727 --> 01:20:30,920

since having arrived here.

01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:31,290
What are you going to do about it?

1303
01:28:31,994 --> 01:28:37,229
I vow to oust this despicable human being
and go to the depths of hell myself.

1304
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,282
Just go to hell by yourself.

1305
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,956
Just go by yourself.
You really do have a mole on your face.

1306
01:28:44,957 --> 01:28:47,494
You put a mole on your face.
Wow, Song Ji Hyo...

1307
01:28:49,589 --> 01:28:52,601
This is nothing compared to
the pain that you gave me!

1308
01:28:52,602 --> 01:28:54,764
- Here, take this!
- How is this nothing?

1309
01:28:54,765 --> 01:28:57,749
- I asked if it hurts!
- It totally hurts!

1310
01:28:58,304 --> 01:29:02,337
Whenever I see you...
I get so pissed and angry!

1311
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:03,770
Enough!

1312
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:08,547
I'm so sick and tired of this.
Seeing you sickens me to my stomach.

1313
01:29:08,548 --> 01:29:11,424
- Pick it up.
- Tell me what wrong have I done?

1314
01:29:11,425 --> 01:29:13,397
Stop blaming me...

1315
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:17,742
and blame yourself for being
so damned attractive!

1316
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:19,622
Stop being so obsessed with Song Ji Hyo.

1317
01:29:19,623 --> 01:29:21,991
I want you to love me, too!

[Money, love, betrayal, and revenge...]

1319
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,124
Why are you taking so many pills?

1320
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:34,922
- I'm going to end everything.
- What are you taking?

1321
01:29:34,923 --> 01:29:36,916
What is this?

1322
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:39,286
They're just vitamins.

1323
01:29:40,638 --> 01:29:42,250
Jong Kook.

1324
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,811
Why can't you understand
how I feel for you?

1325
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:48,788
I really love you.
I even love the goop in your eyes.

Leave.

1329
01:29:56,090 --> 01:30:01,908
This is my studio, and I've
never once hid my feelings from you.

1330
01:30:02,988 --> 01:30:05,530
- Why are you doing this!
- Bastard.

1331
01:30:06,045 --> 01:30:08,404
Please recognize the love
that I have for you!
