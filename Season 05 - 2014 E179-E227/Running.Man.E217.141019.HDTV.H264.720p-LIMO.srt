00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,961
[The ones who control this
neighborhood have arrived.]

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:17,956
[On this street...
only the strongest will survive.]

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,746
Hey, I'll see you later.

6
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:24,328

[The Gang of the Upper Neighborhood (GUN)]
- Let's go and have a cup of coffee.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,515

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,317
[They went to the best coffee
shop in the Upper Neighborhood.]

12
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:42,093
I'm a regular here.

13
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,283
[The GLN are gathered in their hideout.]

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,696
- I heard some new ones joined the GUN.
- Is that right?

15
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:50,232
Three new ones joined the gang.

16
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:52,264
I heard they are pretty unusual.

17
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:55,987
How unusual can they be? Can't
be more than what we're used to.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,042
[The very source of the tumultuous rumors.]

19
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:09,073

00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:27,032
[From being a popular MC...]

00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:34,034
[He successfully transformed
into a talented actor!]

25
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:36,566
[Sang Jin, joins the GUN meeting.]

26
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,202

another guest joins the group.]

great presence, Kim Sung Kyun.]

[He leaves an unforgettable,
strong impression.]

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,711
[His top notch performance
at being a creepy criminal.]

30
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,541

even pull off a comedic character!]

31

[We only see Sung Kyun in movies but
he's come to a neighborhood coffee shop!]

32
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:25,581
[And... the last guest.]

33
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,006
[Surprised]

34
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:42,082
[The Boss has come.]

35
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:44,243
[Totally impressed.]

36
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,707
You're still alive.

37
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,083
[Absolute charisma, Jo Jin Woong.]

38
00:02:54,679 --> 00:03:00,524
[His excellent acting fills the screen.]

39
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:07,036
[His wide spectrum of acting talent enables
him to cross between different genres.]

40
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,531
[If Jo Jin Woong is in it, the
work becomes a masterpiece.]

41
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,702
[Jo Jin Woong, commanding over
30 million audiences.]

42
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,791
Good to see you.

43
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,551
I finally get to see you outside of movies.

44
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,770
Actually, I've met Sang Jin
and Sung Kyun before.

45
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,903
But this is the first time
we've met Jo Jin Woong.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,239
- Please try this, It's called 'Ma-cha'.
- Ma-cha?

47
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,727
Oh, no, thank you.

48
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,482
[Somehow, it doesn't make you
want to drink it.]

49
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,414
[No, thank you.]

50
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:44,207
[The GUN's tradition, Ma-cha?]

51
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,144
I'm not sure about this.

52
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,102
Ah, can I have some water?

53
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,261
But isn't this supposed to be
good for your health?

54
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,723
- Let's go.
- Wait, he's the boss so...

55
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,851
- Of course, we need to give him respect.
- You should be informal with us.

56
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:12,317
- Boss, shall we go?
- Yes, why don't get up, sirs.

57
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,378
[Now, it's time to act.]

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,301
[Let's go, Boss.]

59
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,630
- You're also still alive.
- I'm also still alive.

60
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,379
[Such a caring boss taking
care of his subordinates.]

61
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,126
[The Upper Neighborhood (UN) is alive!]

62
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,366
[And the GLN is waiting for them.]

63
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,427
Hey, you over there.
Come here.

64
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,542
- What's this?
- Going to a wedding or something?

65
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,622
[Don't you dare!]

66
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,823
Come down. We'll duke it out
once you come down.

67
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,308
Come down. You're all alive.

68
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,474
[My legs are crampy...]

69
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,732
- Hi, how are you?
- Say hello to everyone.

70
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,130
Hi, how are you?

71
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:08,563
Greeting each other will end
right here and now.

72
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,825
[It's a psychological
warfare from the beginning.]

73
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,748
Quite a lot of authority in your voice.

74
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,052
The teams will be competing over
the dominance

75
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:19,356
of the upper (UN) and the
lower neighborhood (LN).

76
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:21,338
- You know the Chinese character for 'death'?
- Yes.

77
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,668
This is called 'Death-Bingo Race'.

78
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,014
The team who wins this race
will be granted

79
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,671
a chance in the middle of the mission.

80
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,665
You probably have some idea as to
what chance will work best for your team.

81
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,214
[Using the chance to win
the final Death-Bingo Race!]

82
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,870
[We'll take this Bingo game.]

83
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,654
[The Gang of Upper Neighborhood (GUN)]

84
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,531
[We only played Bingo in school!]

85
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,861
[The Gang of Lower Neighborhood (GLN)]

86
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:50,520
[Each team is headed to the
site for their first mission.]

87
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,724
Sung Kyun and Jin Woong
are really nice.

88
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,928
Say some of those famous movie lines.

89
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,856
You guys are so different than
the characters you play in the movies.

90
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,864
So I was thinking about this all yesterday.

91
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,599
'Should have a drink before I go?'

92
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,660
Before we start the race,
say some lines

93
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,113
from the movies to get them
under control.

94
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:12,511
You should say some strong lines
from the movies.

95
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:16,372
[Yes... this kind of feel!]

96
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:21,832
Sung Kyun should...

97
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:26,259
you know, the tone you used when you
asked for the money from Choi Min Shik.

98
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:34,177
[Making a threat with courtesy...
his chilling acting.]

99
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:37,179
You know, Sung Kyun wore
a wig in that movie.

100
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,056
At first, I thought he was Shin Young.

101
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:41,349
[They do look alike.]

102
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,103
He looked like Kim Shin Young.

103
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,827
Anyway, I feel confident
that Boss is here with us.

104
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,924
So I'm not worried at all.

105
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:55,256
Boss, your arm seems little skinny
compared to your size.

106
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,101
He says he doesn't really exercise.

107
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,769
I really don't like being active.

108
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,567
You look like you'd love to exercise.

109
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,165
[The action actor who doesn't
like to exercise?]

110
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:06,673
- Here, feel it. It's really skinny.
- No, really?

111
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,989
How come it's so mushy?

112
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:17,774
[The golden field at the height of Autumn.]

113
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,984
- You guys have no style.
- Let's go.

114
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,496
[What kind of showdown will unfold here?]

115
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,353
What kind of set is this?

116
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:37,635
[A special mud ring located...
in the middle of a plow field.]

117
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,663
- What's this?
- It's perfect for a face-off.

118
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:43,055
[Perfect for calligraphy using
the mud as ink.]

119
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:46,252
They actually dug the ground.

120
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:51,374
- Go on. Move forward.
- Hey, don't push me.

121
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,858
Should I just dip you in the mud?

122
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:57,718
[Impossible for them to coexist.]
[Destined rivals, the GUN and the GLN.]

123
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:05,715
Today, we prepared a very masculine
game perfect for our three guests.

124
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,068
What is it?

125
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:09,864
[Mud Volleyball]

126
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,865
The difference between
normal volleyball and this is...

127
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:15,265
you have to use the entire mud ring.

128
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:17,307
You will play a normal volleyball game.

129
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:20,089
But if the ball falls outside
the line into the mud...

130
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:22,711
you can hit it back from the mud.

131
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,144
In a normal volleyball game
you have to receive then hit it back.

132
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:29,126
But we don't have that rule in this game.

133
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,530
You just have to hit it back.

134
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,864
So long as the ball it doesn't
touch the ground, it's fine?

135
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:32,867
Yes.

136
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:36,933
You can use your head and any part of
your body to hit the ball back.

137
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,206
The winning team will be awarded
with the

138
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:43,479
chance you can use for
the Death-Bingo Race.

139
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:48,240
Sung Kyun, why don't you say something?
Please say a line.

140
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:49,968
I don't have anything to say.

141
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,760
He's too nice. It's only in the movies.
In real life, he's too nice.

142
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,277
He's an angel.

143
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,376
Jin Woong is my friend.

144
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,547
- Does Jin Woong consider you a friend?
- He's a real gentleman.

145
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:02,484
Yeah, I know.
He's a real gentleman.

146
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:06,194
That's because I haven't
started to say anything, yet.

147
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,153
[Boss Jin Woong has broken his seal.]

148
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:12,143
Now, let's get going.

149
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,027
Okay, let's get going.

150
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,572
Everyone take your microphones off.

151
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,965
We even have to take our
microphones off?

152
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,535
[You'll find out why we
asked you to take them off.]

153
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,439
[Antsy]

154
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,414
Over there.

155
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,417
Wait a minute.

156
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,613
The urgent business is calling.

157
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,760
He'll be right back.
There is no bathroom around here.

158
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:43,469
[Purifying his mind and body
prior to the face-off.]

159
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:47,418
- Hurry up and come back.
- You see? Isn't it brutal?

160
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,553
We have nothing to fear.

161
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,795
- This is awesome.
- Is he really going?

162
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:54,531
- Sung Kyun, go deep in there.
- I think that's enough.

163
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,197
Your camerman is following you.

164
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,779
[The determination of a camerman not
wanting to lose one precious moment.]

165
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,906
[The actor and the VJ are of one
mind and body in Running Man.]

166
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,416
Sung Kyun, you should go further in.

167
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,620
[In the meantime, Sung Kyun is
going deep into nature...]

168
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,588
Go over that hill!

169
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,131
Heli-cam!

170
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,425
[No, don't shoot!]

171

I want to go in later.

522
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,437
[Ah... I'm scared to go in...]

523
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:23,531
First, you need to make the saunas in
the neighborhood come under your control.

524
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:29,847
[Kukk used to 'rule' the city
of Anyang as a student.]

525
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:34,083
If you want to rule all the saunas
you need to put on a gown.

526
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,432
I thought there was a doctor in here.

527
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,077
[The neighborhood dispute
that's hotter than the sauna.]

528

[Preserving man's pride is
more important than the heat.]

00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,427
- You want to get out get out soon, don't you?
- Yes.

532
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:49,072
[Of course!]

533
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,267
A sauna is the place that reminds
you of men.

534

The only person who gets the
answer to the quiz correct

535

will be allowed to leave this room.

there are beach chairs...

prepared for you.

[The privilege you can enjoy only
if you get the answer correct.]

539

First, I'll tell you the category.

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,012
Then one representative from each
neighborhood should give an answer.

541
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:20,822
The team that has all the members
out of the sauna will win this mission.

542
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:24,907
Also, you'll have a chance to bring back
a member from the other team.

543
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,316
I'm sorry but please get to
the point because it's hot in here.

544
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,302

- Fighting!
- Let's go out!

554
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:06,776

[VJ Gwon Yeol, I was told to go in...]

557

It's this person's famous quote.

00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,614
Shakespeare...

559
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,694
Isn't this too easy?

560
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:28,786
Shakespeare said,
'[such and such] men are the best men.'

561
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:34,957
What kind of man was
Shakespeare referring to?

562
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,429
Isn't this too easy?

563
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:43,515
The man who knows himself the best.

564
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,805
No, that's not it.

565
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,314
That was a quote by Socrates.

566
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,519
[This is hard.]

567

573
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:15,145
this type of man is very different
from our members here.

574

[Different from the
Running Man members?]

575

what he's talking about.

- That's number four?

- But why is the result so scary?

614

Rank number three...
'I'll call your mother often.'

615
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:45,727
- That's a lie?
- 'Often', 'call her often' part.

616
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:50,298
Number two... 'Honey, I'll
make you breakfast everyday.'

617

What do you think the
number one lie is?

00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:58,050
- The upper neighborhood.

Okay, I'll give you the problem.

652
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,847
We talked about lies that wives
tell their husbands.

653
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:22,059
This time, it's about lies that
husbands tell their wives.

654
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,495
Suk Jin should know
everything about that.

655

That's Suk Jin's problem.

656

What do you think the
number four lie is?

660
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,068
The number four is more difficult.

661
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:51,255
Excuse me. Suk Jin says it should be
'I fell asleep in the car.'

662

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,493
[Brain Sang Jin is on!]

686
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:40,213
- You should score one this time.
- Don't use the word 'avenge' on me.

687
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:43,053
[A mental collapse. Spaced out Giraffe.]

688
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:45,188
This is about the Joseon Dynasty.

689
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:53,260
This is court speech.
The word 'bisoo' refers to king's what?

690
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,261
You don't even know that?

691
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:58,313
Refers to king's what?

692
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,712
The left minister.

693
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,913
- The left minister?
- Yes.

694
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,019
You mean 'king's left minister'?

695
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,020
Nasal discharge.

696
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,182
'Bi' means nose.
'Soo' means water.

697
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:17,534
[Correct!]

698
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,450
He's really the brain.

699
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,513
Was it that simple?

700
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:29,099
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,602
[Such a polite Sang Jin.]

702
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,559
I didn't even know there
was a word 'bi' for nose.

703
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:35,537
You know, Ear, Nose and Throat.

704
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,666
So it was 'Soo' for water.

705
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:43,271
He's really a brainiac.

706
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:45,454
'Bi' for nose and 'Soo' for water.

707
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:48,815
- Sang Jin is really amazing.
- I've never heard of that word before.

708
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:51,830
But how come a king's 'bisoo'
is about history?

709
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,036
Because it was a term from
the Joseon Dynasty.

710
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,606
Gary, you're doing good today.

711
00:44:58,606 --> 00:45:00,600
Your feel for the showmanship
is at its best today.

712
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:03,378
Do I need to be tired to
be a good entertainer?

713
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:05,988
The next question
is about movies.

714
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,614
Let's go, let's go.
Jin Woong, you go.

715
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:11,331
But I like old movies.

716
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:14,272
But we only have two
comedians here.

717
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:18,007
- We don't need you!
- He's an actor as well.

718
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:21,590
But they are two
comedians over there.

719
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,294
I liked your last movie.

720
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:27,359
Don't go easy on him because
he's older, okay?

721
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,667
I'll do my very best.

722
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:30,176
Be fair.

723
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:33,745
- The Godfather.
- Godfather!

724
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:37,074
I watched it this morning!

725
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:39,597
I know all about it.

726
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:44,493
The main character says this when
he gives advice to someone.

727
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:50,775
'Keep your ___ close
and your ___ closer.'

728
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,745
Okay, okay, you got this, right?

729
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:54,634
Upper.

730
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:57,138
'Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.'

731
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,024
- Lower!
- Be quiet.

732
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:04,001
He'll read that line.

733
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:08,010
'Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.'

734
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:11,819
[Correct.]

735
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,271
He told me to keep your wife close
and your girlfriend closer...

736
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:21,370
- He told me...
- When? When did I say that? When?

737
00:46:22,192 --> 00:46:26,589
- Finally, a chance to turn it around.
- Finally, a chance to turn it around.

738
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,454
- Let's get ready.
- I didn't know that one.

739
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:32,382
- We might lose.
- But... that's a little...

740
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:34,274
But we'll win because of Ha Ha.

741
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:37,539
- He doesn't know much.
- I don't.

742
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,938
The next question is
about literature.

743
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:42,929
I'll give it a shot.

744
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,431
I'll give it a shot.

745
00:46:44,432 --> 00:46:46,101
[It's a game decider.]

746
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:48,240
He writes songs and all.

747
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:51,910
- We mentioned Shakespeare, right?
- We did mention Shakespeare.

748
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:56,015
What are the four great
tragedies by Shakespeare?

749
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:01,634
Upper, Lower.
Upper Lower....

750
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,245
['Who am I and what
am I doing here?']

751
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:07,280
You said Upper for us.

752
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:11,021
Hamlet, Hamlet, Othello.

753
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:15,406
- Macbeth and King Lear.
- King Lear.

754
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:21,403
The four great tragedies by Shakespeare
are Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear.

755
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:23,763
- These four?
- That wasn't the question?

756
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:28,768
Then... where was Hamlet born?

757
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:30,402
Lower!

758
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:31,949
Oh?

759
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,701
- Wasn't it Netherlands?
- Denmark, Denmark.

760
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:38,213
Where was Hamlet born?
Denmark, Denmark.

761
00:47:38,601 --> 00:47:41,695
- Oh, so cool.
- He was the prince of Denmark.

762
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:49,571
Around the time when there
was corruption in Denmark

763
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:52,325
Shakespeare wrote it
using it as the motive.

764
00:47:52,326 --> 00:47:54,674
You studied in school, right?

765
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:57,045
- I majored in theater.
- That's what I mean.

766
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:59,380
I was a man of the theater.

767
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:04,532
['Which country was
Hamlet the prince of?']

768
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,457
- Upper!
- Lower!

769
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,581
Upper Neighborhood first.

770
00:48:07,582 --> 00:48:10,217
That was it?
Iceland.

771
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:11,905
Iceland?

772
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,808
Lower!
U.S.A!

773
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,593
[What?]

774
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:22,705
[USA...]

775
00:48:22,706 --> 00:48:25,219
- He told me too...
- USA doesn't have a king.

776
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,110
USA doesn't have a king.

777
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:30,834
I know, why would USA have a king?
Why would USA have a king?

778
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:33,560
The answer is...

779
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:36,832
- Denmark.
- So, it's North Europe!

780
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,199
I didn't know either.

781
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,932
I did theater but...
how come I don't remember?

782
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:43,994
[Gary escaped after
getting a question right.]

783
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:47,460
- Something men like to hear.
- You got this one.

784
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,289
We like it when women say this.

785
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:54,669
We came up with this question based on the
findings from Wedding Research Center.

786
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:55,847
This is too hard...

787
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:59,533
Top six sayings that... men
like to hear from women.

788
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:02,146
It's about what men like
to hear from women.

789
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:06,691
Sixth place.

790
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,876
'Women seem you find you very attractive.'

791
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,402
I love hearing them say this.

792
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:13,452
It's a great thing to
hear from them.

793
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:16,893
Fifth place.
'You seem to know everyone.'

794
00:49:16,894 --> 00:49:19,367
I didn't expect this one.

795
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:21,924
Four place.
'Is there anything you can't do?'

796
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,289
'Is there anything you can't do?'

797
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,726
Third place.

798
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:29,300
- 'I think you're very loyal.'
- It's a very nice one.

799
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:33,139
First place.
'Do you work out?'

800
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:39,065
- Really? Is that the best one?
- It makes sense.

801
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,180
- Second place?
- Upper!

802
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,983
- 'You dress so well.'
- Yeah, something like that.

803
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:47,228
'You dress so...'

804
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,066
- What would you know about men?
- ['What did he just say?']

805
00:49:54,172 --> 00:49:56,109
It's something that...

806
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,040
many of our females guests have...

807
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,032
said this to you, Kwang Soo.

808
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:05,400
Yeah?

809
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:07,952
To me?

810
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:13,497
- They did.
- Upper! So that's the answer?

811
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:16,467
Not sure because it doesn't
make sense.

812
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:20,459
- 'You look much better in person.'
- That is not it.

813
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,516
'You have clear skin.'

814
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:27,346
Ah...
'You look younger.'

815
00:50:27,347 --> 00:50:31,041
Oh! That's it.
'You look younger.'

816
00:50:31,886 --> 00:50:33,079
That's it.

817
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:37,855
What was it?
Was it a compliment?

818
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:42,762
Upper! We got this!
We got this for sure.

819
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:45,681
- 'You look younger in person.'
- That's it.

820
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:47,931
[Correct.]

821
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:51,665
['That's the answer?']

822
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:54,827
To be more accurate, they told
Lee Kwang Soo...

823
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:57,954
'You don't look your age.'

824
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:01,721
[But to Kwang Soo, it
doesn't mean the same thing.]

825
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:04,591
Drink up.
You did so well.

826
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,804
[Haroro escapes the sauna.]

827
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:10,735
- Go Kwang Soo go!
- Go Sung Kyun!

828
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:13,983
[The current score is 2 to 1.]

829
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:17,055
If Kwang Soo wins the next
round, Upper Neighborhood wins, okay?

830
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:20,953
Yes, yes and we absolutely
have to win this one.

831
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,795
It's your fantasy.

832
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,605
Here is a question.

833
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:30,811
What is... the number one
hobby men want women to have?

834
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:33,699
- Yoga, yoga, yoga.
- Cooking.

835
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,435
Cooking.
Cooking is a good one.

836
00:51:35,436 --> 00:51:38,644
It's a hobby that men
prefer their women to have.

837
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,753
- Lower.
- Lower.

838
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:46,349
If you get this one right,
the LN wins.

839
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:49,773
Cooking!

840
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:54,080
Co... co... cooking?

841
00:51:57,611 --> 00:52:01,113
You said 'yo' three times.
Isn't it yo-yo?

842
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,971
- Cooking.
- Cooking?

843
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,387
Could it?

844
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:12,246
[Correct.]

845
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:16,316
[LN wins.]

846
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:21,685
[It's as if they won a world
championship.]

847
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:24,311
Well done, Kwang Soo!
Well done!

848
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,471
[I lost to Kwang Soo...]

849
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:31,634
We get to get out
of here, right?

850
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:32,680
Sung Kyun.

851
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:34,883
And you didn't know
the answer?

852
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:37,443
How did you know anyway?

853
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:40,135
['Something's fishy, Kwang Soo.']

854
00:52:41,677 --> 00:52:45,513
- For the first time ever, I'm proud of you.
- For real.

855
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:50,406
[LN won a chance card.]

856
00:52:50,715 --> 00:52:54,963
Hey, come over here.
How did you know the answer?

857
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,559
- It's suspicious.
- I escaped the sauna, anyway.

858
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,490
You're very suspicious.

859
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:04,194
- Jong Kook!
- How did you know cooking was the answer?

860
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:07,346
And also it's just too suspicious
that you didn't even hesitate.

861
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:10,528
It's not your style to
answer a question so fast.

862
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:15,050
- How did you know the answer?
- Sung Kyung, why are you doing this?

863
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:25,804
- This is a horse riding course in Hongcheon.
- Horse riding.

864
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,316
It's a Death Bingo race which
requires four deadly lines.

865
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:32,005
This is your last mission.

866
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:35,054
We'll tell you about
the rules later on.

867
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:37,794
We'll have you go to your spot.
Let's move!

868
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:38,795
Here?

869
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,365
Anyone from UN here?

870
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:43,317
Are we riding horses?

871
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:46,531
Oh, what's the smell?

872
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,227
['Are you a Giraffe?']

873
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:57,940
- Let's remove your eye patch.
- Can I?

874
00:53:57,941 --> 00:53:59,649
Please remove your eye patch.

875
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:01,753
['Hey, Giraffe.']

876
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:04,459
<i>I'll tell you about the final mission.</i>

877
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,360
From now on, it's a melee, or free for all

878
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,475
where everyone
competes against everyone else.

879
00:54:10,477 --> 00:54:12,142
What?

880
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,867
Ah, it's a melee.

881
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:18,571
The final mission is the
Death Bingo race.

882
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:20,958
It's Death Bingo.

883
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:25,319
<i>- It's Death Bingo.
- Huh?</i>

884
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:34,113
On your three by three matrices, you write
down the names of everyone except yourself.

885
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:37,002
Make your own bingo cards.

886
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:44,151
<i>When someone's name tag
has been removed</i>

887
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:47,006
<i>You can mark the square of the
person who has been eliminated.</i>

888
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:49,250
They want us to
fill up the blanks.

889
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,534
It's a game of human bingo.

890
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:54,420
Whoever is eliminated, I get
to mark that square, right?

891
00:54:54,421 --> 00:55:03,718
<i>The person whose name tag is
intact and has completed four lines</i>

892
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:10,214
<i>needs to stand on the ending bingo
square and shout 'bingo' to win.</i>

893
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:12,741
<i>Okay, lastly...</i>

894
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:19,739
<i>the chance cards you have won give you
the right to choose a particular square.</i>

895
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,230
<i>If you look at your
three by three matrices</i>

896
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,097
<i>On the first square</i>

897
00:55:24,098 --> 00:55:31,243
<i>you have to write a name from Team
LN who lost the first mission.</i>

898
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,746
<i>And on the last square</i>

899
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:40,201
<i>you have to write a name from
the UN who lost the second mission.</i>

900
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:47,152
Nine names except mine.

901
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:50,779
Who should be in the center?
It's a very important square.

902
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,973
I need to choose someone who's
likely to get eliminated first.

903
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:56,862
I think they will write
my name in the center.

904
00:55:57,508 --> 00:56:01,420
Let's write 'Ji Suk Jin' in the center.
That's the way to go.

905
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:04,822
I have to write Suk Jin's
name for sure in the center.

906
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:10,672
I'm sorry, Suk Jin. But you play the
most crucial role in this round.

907
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:14,099
I shouldn't think too much
about things like this.

908
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:20,046
The center is the golden spot.

909
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:24,537
[And Ji Suk wrote Sang Jin's
name in the center.]

910
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:27,568
It's a melee, you know?

911
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:33,123
It's not like I've never
watched Running Man before.

912
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:36,384
It's, it's just exactly
the way it should be.

913
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,926
[Showy.]

914
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:43,029
This is the answer sheet, you know?

915
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:46,516
Based on who...

916
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:50,901
gets eliminated first, I should
make my move accordingly.

917
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:57,467
<i>From now on, Death Bingo game...</i>

918
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:00,663
<i>will start in five seconds.</i>

919
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:07,113
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

920
00:57:07,114 --> 00:57:10,050
<i>Start!</i>

921
00:57:10,796 --> 00:57:15,609
First of all, walking around so early
in the game only makes me a target.

922
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,064
I should wait for my chance.

923
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:23,561
Since Kim Jong Kook is a beast,
it take more than just sheer strength.

924
00:57:23,562 --> 00:57:29,161
It seems... this will be a
battle of tactics and strategy.

925
00:57:33,948 --> 00:57:36,480
Sung Kyun!
It's here.

926
00:57:37,142 --> 00:57:38,906
Everyone's gathering.

927
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:42,646
Jae Suk, Jae Suk, it has
to be Kim Jong Kook first.

928
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:45,519
We need to remove a
gigantic threat first.

929
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,718
Because we can't win otherwise.

930
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,960
['What did you say?']

931
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,869
[He's listening.]

932
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,336
He's the brain.
He's the brain.

933
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,732
Not one person can
complete all four lines.

934
00:57:57,733 --> 00:58:01,796
['You want to rally
up against me, huh?']

935
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:03,893
Jae Suk ran away already?

936
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:07,835
[One person here is not involved
in the conversation because]

937
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:12,762
[he needs to look at his
card and their names.]

938
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,376
[Oh Sang Jin.]

939
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:24,102
[Ha Ha.]

940
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,269
['Who gets to rest first?']

941
00:58:37,004 --> 00:58:40,742
[He's smiling so innocently but
can't tell what he's thinking.]

942
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:43,926
Be smart about this.

943
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:46,257
This is the answer sheet period.

944
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,810
Could I ride a horse around?

945
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,220
['I won't let you.']

946
00:58:53,431 --> 00:58:55,429
Have a good day.

947
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:01,572
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

948
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,221
[I understand.]

949
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:10,688
[Now he's locked and
loaded or rather 'unloaded.']

950
00:59:12,122 --> 00:59:14,994
Okay, I think I have to
go out there, otherwise...

951
00:59:14,994 --> 00:59:17,355
[Center spot Big Nosed brother
feeling anxious.]

952
00:59:18,406 --> 00:59:20,870
[He walks around and...]

953
00:59:23,089 --> 00:59:25,732
['Hello.']

954
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:29,702
[As soon as he's out of
hiding, he's spotted.]

955
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:39,285
['Guys, see you later!']

956
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:42,270
['Get him!']

957
00:59:46,297 --> 00:59:48,066
[Running at full speed.]

958
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:50,792
So tired of doing
this week after week.

959
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:53,067
['But this is our first time.']

960
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:56,138
Why are you doing this?
My legs!

961
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:58,147
[Sang Jin and Sung Kyun
won't let up.]

962
00:59:58,148 --> 00:59:59,935
This is not how you do it!

963
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:04,467
- Come, come, one by one.
- I'll defend.

964
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,774
['Suk Jin']

965
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:09,690
['I'm here too.']

966
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:12,930
[That's when...]

967
01:00:12,931 --> 01:00:15,435
[Jin Woong attacks Sang Jin.]

968
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:20,074
[Sang Jin deflects the attack
and then Kwang Soo attacks!]

969
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:23,925
Everyone has gone crazy.

970
01:00:23,926 --> 01:00:26,274
[It's a dog-eat-dog war.]

971
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,361
I should...

972
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:34,210
[Sung Kyun, waiting for his chance]

973
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:36,653
[ambushes Jae Suk.]

974
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:40,378
[Sung Kyung the bingo killer
with an innocent smile.]

975
01:00:40,379 --> 01:00:43,768
Sung Kyun, how could
you do this to me?

976
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:46,954
[There are no friends
on this mission.]

977
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:48,922
[Welcome to Death Bingo world.]

978
01:00:48,923 --> 01:00:51,735
Hey Sung Kyun,
let's be rational about this.

979
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,484
Sung Kyun, Sung Kyun.

980
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,994
Let's be rational about this.
Let's be rational about this.

981
01:00:57,995 --> 01:01:00,305
[But!]

982
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,619
[Sang Jin the passionate
rookie ambushes Ji Suk.]

983
01:01:09,528 --> 01:01:11,682
[Thanks to Sang Jin,
Sung Kyun is alive.]

984
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:14,889
Thank you Sang Jin!

985
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,231
Seriously, unbelievable...

986
01:01:17,232 --> 01:01:21,394
- Suk Jin, I'm sorry.
- Hey, how is your bingo going?

987
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:25,424
I'm so mad.
I'm so mad!

988
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:27,887
[Ji Suk Jin out.]

989
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,863
<i>Ji Suk Jin out.</i>

990
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:32,705
Right. Just as I expected.

991
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:38,082
The center needs to
open things up first.

992
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:42,358
[Everyone is excited
to mark their cards.]

993
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:44,634
The best spot.

994
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,626
From now, possibilities are open.

995
01:01:46,627 --> 01:01:48,321
Ji Suk, I'm sorry.

996
01:01:48,322 --> 01:01:49,681
I'm sorry.

997
01:01:49,682 --> 01:01:51,849
<i>Sorry, Ji Suk.</i>

998
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,238
[Ji Suk Jin out.]

999
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,126
Sang Jin...

1000
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,393
Oh, that's a good spot.
Not easy for me.

1001
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,611
[Action!]

1002
01:02:12,739 --> 01:02:14,992
[The target is Sang Jin,
the passionate rookie.]

1003
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:18,902
Hey, hey, please don't run fast.

1004
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:22,109
Kwang Soo!
Kwang Soo!

1005
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,468
I have to help him.
I have to help him.

1006
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:28,419
[Sang Jin is a fast runner.]

1007
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,479
Why do you keep running around and
taking off name tags and all?

1008
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,792
I don't know.

1009
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:36,826
[Jin Woong is going
against Sung Kyun again?]

1010
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:41,512
There he goes again.]

1011
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:45,975
[Sang Jin runs to
wherever the action is.]

1012
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:49,057
[Sang Jin wants to join Sung Kyung
to go against Jin Woong.]

1013
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,884
Got him!

1014
01:02:50,885 --> 01:02:52,700
[What?]

1015
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:56,132
[Sung Kyun takes down Sang Jin!]

1016
01:02:56,133 --> 01:02:58,195
Wait, what's happening?

1017
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,955
You and I stand about
this far apart.

1018
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,244
Let's work together and
take off a name tag.

1019
01:03:05,245 --> 01:03:07,997
Push me away. Try it.

1020
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:10,008
This is the best timing
for Sang Jin to come in.

1021
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:13,466
Okay. Just tell me
what to do instead.

1022
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:16,122
[This is how they teamed up.]

1023
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:17,338
Hey.

1024
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:22,214
Jin Woong. Jin Woong.
Pretend to attack me.

1025
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:27,771
[Just as the script says. Action!]

1026
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:31,434
['There they go!']

1027
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:35,765
[The passionate rookie
runs right into the trap.]

1028
01:03:35,766 --> 01:03:37,786
How come he runs like that?

1029
01:03:37,787 --> 01:03:40,644
[So that's what happened.]

1030
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:43,901
What's happening?
Please don't do this.

1031
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:49,028
[Sang Jin does everything
he can to escape the trap.]

1032
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:55,548
[Oh Sang Jin out.]

1033
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,385
I had no idea it would be that easy.

1034
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:07,712
- This must be the joy of fishing.
- I'll corner them in for you.

1035
01:04:08,494 --> 01:04:12,423
[How long will their
strategy last?]

1036
01:04:12,994 --> 01:04:17,539
If we keep doing this, the
only beneficiary is Jong Kook.

1037
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,493
Let's do this then.

1038
01:04:19,494 --> 01:04:22,847
[Is Jin Woong sharing
the secret strategy?]

1039
01:04:22,848 --> 01:04:27,074
- To get Jong Kook?
- No, you... run into the building.

1040
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:28,717
Jong Kook is...

1041
01:04:30,425 --> 01:04:33,599
Hey hey!

1042
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:39,589
Kwang Soo, come here!

1043
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:44,697
[Giraffe is the target now.]

1044
01:04:46,337 --> 01:04:48,124
[Chaos breaks out again.]

1045
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,315
['Get Kwang Soo!']

1046
01:04:52,074 --> 01:04:54,374
[Yoo Hyuk avoids getting
eliminated by falling down.]

1047
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:57,151
[Sung Kyung attacks
Yoo Hyuk again.]

1048
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,517
Oh, wait a minute!

1049
01:04:59,518 --> 01:05:04,487
[Whoever shows his back becomes
the target in Death Bingo world.]

1050
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:05,570
We need to get Jong Kook.

1051
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:08,431
Come here, I should get you
because you disrespected me.

1052
01:05:08,432 --> 01:05:10,715
I thought you were
sending me a sign.

1053
01:05:10,716 --> 01:05:13,819
I'm sorry. I thought you
were sending me a sign.

1054
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,210
I'll taking yours off.
I said I'm taking yours off.

1055
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:20,628
- Please give me another chance.
- Have a seat. Stay there.

1056
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:22,104
I was talking with him.

1057
01:05:22,105 --> 01:05:26,210
You're making him upset.
Don't do that.

1058
01:05:26,211 --> 01:05:27,792
He's right. We were talking...

1059
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:30,779
We were in a conversation. You
should at least have some respect.

1060
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,534
- You shouldn't do that either, Gary.
- What about?

1061
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:35,750
Everyone needs a good talking to.

1062
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:40,960
What day is it today?
Go on a date for a bit.

1063
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:42,455
Not right now.

1064
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:45,632
- I was talking with them.
- I wouldn't even...

1065
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:47,832
Isn't it so much fun, Jae Suk?

1066
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:50,923
[Even Jae Suk gets disciplined.]

1067
01:05:51,725 --> 01:05:55,591
- Kwang Soo, have a seat.
- Are you my teacher?

1068
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:58,331
Let's sit. Let's sit, everyone.

1069
01:05:58,332 --> 01:06:00,374
Let's have a long distance talk.

1070
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,458
- It's waste of human resources to keep this up.
- That's right.

1071
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,420
We should take Kim Jong Kook
and Ha Ha out.

1072
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:11,231
And no betraying anyone just because you
see an opening while we tag out Jong Kook.

1073
01:06:11,232 --> 01:06:12,905
[The person most
likely to do that.]

1074
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:16,805
Everyone, while our goal is
for everyone to survive...

1075
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:21,632
if we are to get Jong Kook, we should
expect one of us to be eliminated.

1076
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:24,276
['Really?']

1077
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:27,834
- If we don't tag out Jong Kook...
- Where are you going?

1078
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:29,153
Ha Ha!

1079
01:06:29,154 --> 01:06:30,578
Come here.

1080
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:33,977
Ha Ha, hurry.
Before we change our minds.

1081
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:37,704
The first rule in surviving
long term in Running Man.

1082
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:39,469
'Don't make an impulse move.'

1083
01:06:40,406 --> 01:06:45,660
Rule two. Before you join a gathering,
feel out the vibe before you do.

1084
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:49,770
I would like one of
us to be the winner.

1085
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:51,305
I hope so as well.

1086
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,397
I hope Jong Kook doesn't win.

1087
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:55,608
One, two, three.
Let's do it!

1088
01:06:58,121 --> 01:06:59,804
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1089
01:07:03,664 --> 01:07:05,336
This way.

1090
01:07:06,214 --> 01:07:07,527
I'll go this way.

1091
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,361
Breaking through the front?

1092
01:07:09,362 --> 01:07:10,966
He might ambush us.

1093
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:14,861
[They intend to surround him.]

1094
01:07:15,274 --> 01:07:18,496
[Nervous.]

1095
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:21,610
['Are']

1096
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:22,463
['You']

1097
01:07:22,464 --> 01:07:23,734
['Looking']

1098
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:28,875
['For me?']

1099
01:07:29,524 --> 01:07:32,867
[Jong Kook was waiting for
his chance to move in.]

1100
01:07:33,898 --> 01:07:35,382
[Attacking Ha Ha.]

1101
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:42,521
[Taking off his name tag
before he could react.]

1102
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:44,581
[Then he disappears.]

1103
01:07:44,582 --> 01:07:46,931
[Blank.]

1104
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,549
It was so scary.

1105
01:07:51,346 --> 01:07:53,991
- He came out of nowhere.
- It was Jong Kook.

1106
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:56,655
[Everyone witnessed a
shocking hunt down.]

1107
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,618
Our alliance is over.

1108
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:05,135
[Did he really... gain
super powers last week?]

1109
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:08,474
[This is how Mr. Capable
handles the alliance.]

1110
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:11,103
<i>Why can't you trust me?</i>

1111
01:08:12,284 --> 01:08:14,760
['Yeah, I'm game.']

1112
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,928
[Shocked.]

1113
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,241
Everyone, let's mark
our cards first.

1114
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:26,541
[We feel so scared but let's
do what needs to be done.]

1115
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,236
Wow, that was so scary.

1116
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:32,452
[Three players are
tagged out so far.]

1117
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,669
I don't even have one line.

1118
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:42,432
Jong Kook, you know I'm
your friend, right?

1119
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:44,397
But you're too powerful.

1120
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,981
Ah... I have nothing...

1121
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:56,201
[Nobody has four complete
lines to win the game yet.]

1122
01:08:58,223 --> 01:09:02,263
- Sung Kyun, isn't it really scary?
- We're all that's left.

1123
01:09:03,058 --> 01:09:05,321
- He's so spooky.
- Where did he come from?

1124
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:11,892
It's like we've been assaulted by
special forces like the Navy Seals.

1125
01:09:12,646 --> 01:09:15,679
Let's spread out in three
ways and look for him.

1126
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,732
Two of you go that way and
let's meet around the back.

1127
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,356
And what if he attacks again?

1128
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:24,703
[The alliance is searching
for Mr. Capable.]

1129
01:09:25,164 --> 01:09:30,257
I don't think... we should
be talking as we walk.

1130
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,638
We should be... extra cautious.

1131
01:09:37,977 --> 01:09:40,378
I felt like he'll jump
down from up there.

1132
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,981
Don't you think so?

1133
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:45,894
['You... think so?']

1134
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:50,047
- Jong Kook might take us all out.
- We shouldn't waste human resources.

1135
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,026
Jong Kook will end up winning again.

1136
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:55,429
You were being very
disrespectful to me back there.

1137
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:59,547
- You think I really wanted to do it?
- Right?

1138
01:10:00,056 --> 01:10:03,142
I was breaking your
fall, you know?

1139
01:10:03,959 --> 01:10:06,669
How did you grab my name
tag by tapping on it?

1140
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:12,713
For a tiny split second you grabbed
it but didn't take it off.

1141
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:15,266
What are you talking about?

1142
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:19,347
You know? And you know who
our target is, right?

1143
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:22,925
- Around here.
- Some place like here.

1144
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:25,082
We should keep our eyes peeled.

1145
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:29,919
[Yoo Hyun checks under the
vehicles just in case.]

1146
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,738
[Mr. Capable again?]

1147
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:41,930
['Jae Suk, it's me.']

1148
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:46,182
['What the...']

1149
01:10:46,183 --> 01:10:49,183
[Betraying him 10 seconds
after promising not to.]

1150
01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:02,164
['Get over there!']

1151
01:11:02,165 --> 01:11:03,679
You'll see why.

1152
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,177
[Jae Suk feels uncontrollable anger.]

1153
01:11:06,672 --> 01:11:08,936
[Because doing this gives Kwang Soo
two complete lines.]

1154
01:11:08,937 --> 01:11:12,358
- Jae Suk, I'm sorry.
- Hey, you call yourself human?

1155
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:14,036
Please cover his mouth.

1156
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:16,892
You call yourself human?
You call yourself human?

1157
01:11:16,893 --> 01:11:19,422
Hey, I'll...

1158
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:22,646
Just the moment before...
He is...

1159
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:25,292
Agh, seriously.

1160
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:28,239
So mad!

1161
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,859
So unfair!
So mad!

1162
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:37,452
<i>Yoo Jae Suk out.
Yoo Jae Suk out.</i>

1163
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,102
- Did Jong Kook do it?
- Jong Kook.

1164
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,731
Kwang Soo!

1165
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:54,119
You got to do what
you got to do.

1166
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:59,096
[X's are adding up
more and more.]

1167
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:00,367
So mad!

1168
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,497
When Ji Hyo is out...

1169
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:06,025
<i>Hey, Lee Kwang Soo
tagged me out!</i>

1170
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:11,573
['I need to look for Ji Hyo.']

1171
01:12:18,885 --> 01:12:21,917
I think it's the most shocking thing
I came across in recent times.

1172
01:12:21,918 --> 01:12:23,433
It's so brutal here.

1173
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:26,951
- Wow, Kwang Soo, seriously...
- How could Kwang Soo do that?

1174
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:31,066
['It's time now.']

1175
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:33,593
Is it possible to keep friends that way?

1176
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:35,513
Very tough.
I don't hang out with him much.

1177
01:12:38,212 --> 01:12:43,002
[Anti-Mr. Capable Alliance
minus Kwang Soo.]

1178
01:12:44,713 --> 01:12:46,246
Jong Kook over there.

1179
01:12:46,682 --> 01:12:48,475
Don't come near.

1180
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:50,219
Where is everyone?

1181
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,029
Did you team up with Kwang Soo?

1182
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:58,730
[Everyone is walking toward Jong Kook.]

1183
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:06,837
[One person looks at the card.]

1184
01:13:06,838 --> 01:13:09,200
[Song Ji Hyo.]

1185
01:13:11,122 --> 01:13:14,657
['No, the Devil's talking to me.']

1186
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,962
Are you going after Kwang Soo?

1187
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:23,723
Kwang Soo betrayed Jae Suk.

1188
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:35,570
['Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it.']

1189
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:38,078
['Okay.']

1190
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,617
[Going for Gary and Ji
Hyo at the same time.]

1191
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:48,250
[There will be only
one winner anyway.]

1192
01:13:55,689 --> 01:13:58,647
[But.]

1193
01:13:58,648 --> 01:14:01,115
[Gary's name tag is still on?]

1194
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,096
[Bingo Killer is not
too meticulous.]

1195
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:10,242
Hey, good job. Wow.

1196
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:14,114
But you didn't tag me out?

1197
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:15,906
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

1198
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:19,639
- He should've tagged me out instead.
- So unbelievable.

1199
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,826
['I am the Bingo Killer.']

1200
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:25,183
- I'm sorry.
- Let's cross a name.

1201
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:26,810
Let's check your cards.

1202
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:39,128
[With Ji Hyo out, Sung Kyun
has two complete lines.]

1203
01:14:39,129 --> 01:14:40,801
Not too many of us left.

1204
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:43,243
Thanks to him.

1205
01:14:43,928 --> 01:14:45,101
Here they are.

1206
01:14:45,102 --> 01:14:48,317
[Kkuk has one complete line.]

1207
01:14:49,192 --> 01:14:52,417
<i>- Song Ji Hyo, out.
- Then I have two lines.</i>

1208
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:56,350
I should tag out Jin Woong for sure.
But Jong Kook...

1209
01:14:56,807 --> 01:14:59,574
<i>Song Ji Hyo out.</i>

1210
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:02,373
I put Ji Hyo right
in the center.

1211
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:05,549
- I have one line.
- Me too.

1212
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:08,400
[A fun thing to do in jail.]

1213
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:11,354
Once Jin Woong is out...
I have two.

1214
01:15:11,355 --> 01:15:13,909
- Me too.
- I need Sung Kyun.

1215
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:22,808
Hey, let's get Jong Kook.

1216
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:26,688
[But they've been
saying that for hours.]

1217
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,320
Let's get it done at least once.

1218
01:15:32,099 --> 01:15:35,578
- Please stop looking at it.
- I...

1219
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:42,560
to be honest... if I have
Kwang Soo and Gary's names...

1220
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:47,271
- I win but...
- You're scaring me.

1221
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:51,585
- However, I...
- Please look at me in a nice way.

1222
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:57,397
I would like to catch a whale.
It's my dream.

1223
01:15:57,398 --> 01:16:00,488
I'm taking off my glasses.
OK.

1224
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,931
['How many fingers are these?']

1225
01:16:04,904 --> 01:16:07,197
Let's go.
Let's go.

1226
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,537
- Jin Woong, you won't tag me out by mistake?
- No, no.

1227
01:16:11,018 --> 01:16:14,552
- Since we're in a lion's den.
- Since we're born as men.

1228
01:16:14,553 --> 01:16:16,383
To catch a big one.

1229
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:19,069
- Let's hold hands just in case.
- Let's hold hands.

1230
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:27,534
['We're coming for you, Kim Jong Kook.']

1231
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:33,700
There are a lot of cars there, right?

1232
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:39,681
He's so weird.

1233
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:43,067
He pretends to look over there
but his one eye looked at me.

1234
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:47,631
How did he do that?
His one eye looked at me.

1235
01:16:47,632 --> 01:16:49,884
It's so weird.

1236
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,882
- Awesome.
- My zodiac sign is the chameleon.

1237
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:57,315
I was so scared.

1238
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:01,749
[They look for Jong Kook
in the surveillance room.]

1239
01:17:04,983 --> 01:17:07,896
['Jong Kook, where are you?']

1240
01:17:10,328 --> 01:17:13,662
Oh! Oh? Over here.

1241
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:15,890
[Here's Mr. Capable!]

1242
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:17,516
What's the use in hiding?

1243
01:17:17,517 --> 01:17:20,282
Let's stand where I won't
get hurt if I fall down.

1244
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:27,429
- Okay, let's go.
- Time to face off.

1245
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,098
- Let's not hesitate.
- Here, here they are.

1246
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:32,309
Time to face off.

1247
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:37,060
I'll block the escape route.

1248
01:17:37,061 --> 01:17:39,128
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

1249
01:17:42,882 --> 01:17:47,151
[But Jong Kook grabs him
instead and...]

1250
01:17:47,152 --> 01:17:49,757
[takes him out!]

1251
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:58,549
['What just happened here?']

1252
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:03,243
['He was running straight
into Jong Kook.']

1253
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,575
[Forlorn.]

1254
01:18:06,576 --> 01:18:08,228
Are you alright?

1255
01:18:14,043 --> 01:18:16,766
- Are you alright?
- Something brushed by me.

1256
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:20,635
I... looked at Jong Kook's face...

1257
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,442
When, when did he get there?

1258
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:34,178
We... we should change our plan.

1259
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:38,652
[Might be easier for him to tag out
Gary and Kwang Soo at the same time.]

1260
01:18:38,653 --> 01:18:43,462
Now that you're out... I hate
that I'm crossing off your name.

1261
01:18:44,951 --> 01:18:46,326
[Sung Kyun has three lines.]

1262
01:18:46,327 --> 01:18:49,382
[He just needs one more
name to win the game.]

1263
01:18:50,775 --> 01:18:54,132
[And Kwang Soo needs to tag out
Sung Kyun or Jong Kook to win.]

1264
01:18:56,271 --> 01:19:00,667
[Gary also needs to tag out
Sung Kyun or Jong Kook to win.]

1265
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:08,536
[Jong Kook needs to tag
out Sung Kyun to win.]

1266
01:19:17,845 --> 01:19:21,502
- To be absolutely clear...
- Who tagged you out?

1267
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:24,276
I resisted to the best of
my ability till the end.

1268
01:19:24,277 --> 01:19:26,339
- Kim Jong Kook?
- It was a fierce battle.

1269
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,231
Did you go for Jong
Kook by yourself?

1270
01:19:28,232 --> 01:19:31,088
- And by myself.
- Really?

1271
01:19:31,089 --> 01:19:33,051
It was so fierce.

1272
01:19:33,052 --> 01:19:35,928
- Jong Kook was extremely surprised.
- Oh...

1273
01:19:35,929 --> 01:19:38,821
- Since your clothes are still clean...
- That's true.

1274
01:19:38,822 --> 01:19:41,707
But look at my shoe laces.

1275
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:45,352
- Let's go in together.
- We were in too much of a hurry.

1276
01:19:46,543 --> 01:19:48,568
Alright. Going for Kim Sung Kyun.

1277
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:52,315
I just need to get Kim Sung Kyun.
And it's game over.

1278
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:53,723
I need Sung Kyun.

1279
01:19:53,724 --> 01:19:55,751
We need good team work.

1280
01:19:55,752 --> 01:19:57,983
He's extremely fast as well.

1281
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:02,910
There he is.

1282
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:04,859
[One more name to
decide the outcome.]

1283
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,763
[Who'll be tagged out first?]

1284
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:20,368
I can see what you're thinking.
I can see.

1285
01:20:21,147 --> 01:20:22,867
Why not walk straight?

1286
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:25,993
[They were walking sideways.]

1287
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:28,112
You know...

1288
01:20:28,113 --> 01:20:31,532
Why are you walking like this?
Why walk like this?

1289
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:37,022
Let's go together,
and holding hands.

1290
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:42,373
And why do you grab my
hands loosely? Why?

1291
01:20:42,374 --> 01:20:44,290
Let's hold tightly.

1292
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:51,670
[The alliance was formed
to catch the big one.]

1293
01:20:51,671 --> 01:20:54,737
[But...]

1294
01:20:57,635 --> 01:20:59,756
[What has respect got to do
with winning?]

1295
01:20:59,757 --> 01:21:01,366
[Giraffe takes the
easy road to victory.]

1296
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:04,059
<i>Kim Sung Kyun out.</i>

1297
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,894
[Kwang Soo and Gary
have 4 complete lines!]

1298
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,544
Am I out?

1299
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:10,263
<i>Kim Sung Kyun out.</i>

1300
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:15,000
[They are still playing a fantasy
game of bingo.]

1301
01:21:17,108 --> 01:21:19,372
Hey! Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

1302
01:21:19,373 --> 01:21:24,059
[Who will get to claim
the victory first?]

1303
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:26,484
[So close!]

1304
01:21:26,485 --> 01:21:27,935
Oh, what's this?

1305
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:37,763
Bingo!

1306
01:21:38,297 --> 01:21:40,415
- Bingo!
- What's this?

1307
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:46,001
[How did Kkuk get here?]

1308
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:50,677
There might be someone who
has to tag out Sung Kyun.

1309
01:21:50,678 --> 01:21:55,136
In a split second, I need
to start running toward it.

1310
01:21:56,353 --> 01:21:59,130
[As soon as he heard
the announcement...]

1311
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:02,720
[he ran toward the end zone.]

1312
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:08,633
[That's how he claimed the victory
with a walk in the park.]

1313
01:22:08,634 --> 01:22:12,262
You need to use your head more
than your muscles. For sure.

1314
01:22:12,263 --> 01:22:14,608
['Look, who's talking.']

1315
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:17,165
You can't be saying that.

1316
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:20,065
[The final winner is
Kim Jong Kook.]

1317
01:22:20,066 --> 01:22:23,044
- Hey, what is this?
- Not happy to see you at all.

1318
01:22:23,045 --> 01:22:25,068
Thanks to your betrayal.

1319
01:22:25,069 --> 01:22:27,264
It's because you tagged me out.

1320
01:22:27,265 --> 01:22:29,314
- No, Jae Suk.
- Hear me out. Oh, what's this?

1321
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:32,190
Oh, it's a bingo card.

1322
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:34,952
[A golden bingo card.]

1323
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:38,289
- It should be worth about 27 million won.
- That's trophy.

1324
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:42,224
- I can't trust anyone.
- Don't call me this week.

1325
01:22:42,225 --> 01:22:44,770
- He's the one!
- Kwang Soo!

1326
01:22:44,771 --> 01:22:46,937
You got what you deserve!

1327
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:49,164
How many lines did you have?

1328
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:52,074
- You know, it's...
- How many... one line?

1329
01:22:53,661 --> 01:22:56,726
The thing is I didn't
tag out anyone either.

1330
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,535
He didn't tag out anyone and not good
at bingo either, but he kept on leading.

1331
01:23:02,536 --> 01:23:05,947
He was leading the charge
way in front of everyone.
