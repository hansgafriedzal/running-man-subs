I thought you wanted me to
stand there. I'm sorry.

Thank you, Kwang Soo.

90
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,047
[I'm so glad I gave her my coat!]

91
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,708

- They took care to dress for the show.
- Knock it off!

94
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,167
[This air of excitement is the
effect Ye Seul has on the members.]

95
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:48,027
I'm in such a great mood
right now.

96
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:53,084

White Knight vs Black Knight Race.

I will announce the two teams
before we start the mission.

98
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:06,567
The Red Team is Han Ye Seul, Han Sang Jin,
Yoo Jae Suk, Ha Ha, and Lee Kwang Soo.

99
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,595
The remaining members will
make up the other team.

100
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:17,824
The Blue Team is Sang Wook, Gyu Woon,

00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:21,051
[Blue Team- Sang Wook, Gyu Woon, Ji Hye,
Suk Jin, Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo.]

102
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:26,909
I need each of you to come up and choose
a card from the table in front of you.

103
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:34,094
[They cannot share the identity of
their card with anyone else.]

104
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,922
[Members of both teams complete
making their card selection.]

105
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,212
- Have you checked your cards?
- Yes.

106
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,960
The cards showed a picture of either
a white knight or a black knight.

107
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:47,948
[The cards contained a picture of
either a black or a white knight.]

108
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,911
Of the twelve cards, there were five
white knights and seven black knights.

109
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:59,455
But the numbers of each of those knights
are divided up between the two teams.

110
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,427
They're all mixed between the two teams.

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,068
- Then one of us could be a black knight?
- Yes, that's correct.

112
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:11,491
There could be some black knights
on White Knight Team as well.

113
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,802
- I'm not sure what mine is.
- Don't act like that.

114
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:18,533
Han Ye Seul is the white knight's queen.

115
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,912
The representative of the team
that wins the mission

116
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:28,018
will get to find out how many black and
white knights there are on their team

117
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,904
and they'll get the chance to swap out one of
their team members with an opposing member.

118
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,521
The goal of your mission is this.

119
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:39,571
There will be a total of five exchanges
made throughout the race today.

120
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:45,130
If everyone on the White Knight Team
ends up being white knights in the end

121
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,786
then her team wins the race.

122
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,350
Those with the black knight
card in their hand

123
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:53,862
must try to stand with the White Knight Team
at the end to deter them from winning.

124
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,183
- That's how Team Black Knight can win.
- Okay, let's win this race!

125
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,858
Go away.

126
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,145
- Can I get an umbrella?
- I think he's a black knight.

127
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:10,469
[Only they know whether
they're a black or white knight.]

128
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,793
[Will Ye Seul be able to gather all
of her five white knights together?]

129
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:21,226
How are we going to differentiate the
white knights from the black knights?

130
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:24,368
Sang Wook, if you're a black knight,
then just get away from us.

131
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:27,183
- Black knight?
- Then are you a white knight?

132
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:30,275
- Are you a white knight?
- I'm just walking right now.

133
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,596
- Fold up your umbrella.
- Fold up your umbrella, Sang Wook.

134
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,558
[Flustered Actor Joo?]

135
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,882
There has to be at least one
white knight on our team, right?

136
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,004
[The Blue Team is also trying to
determine who each of them are.]

137
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:42,591
- Are you white or black?
- She looks like a white knight.

138
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:45,102
Can't you just tell by her porcelain skin
that she's a white knight?

139
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,100
- You do have very porcelain skin.
- I don't trust actors.

140
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,844
[Will they be able to tell the white
knights apart from the black knights?]

141
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:53,593
Wow, you really are so pretty.
How can you be that pretty?

142
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,034
Ye Seul, isn't this practically your
first time on a variety show?

143
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,262
- I think it's been seven years.
- Seven years?

144
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:01,629
[First variety show
appearance in seven years.]

145
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,474
I don't think I've ever done
a show with Ye Seul before.

146
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,316
Then why are you talking
so casually with her?

147
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,334
She's like a sister to me!

148
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,915
- It's nice to meet you.
- What the heck!

149
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,794
[Or someone whom he wants to
be as close as a brother to.]

150
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:18,187
- What's wrong with you these days?
- Did you just see what Ye Seul did?

151
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,271
[Pretending to hit Jae Suk?]

152
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,761
[But Ye Seul did this to me earlier.]

153
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,838
Ye Seul is the best!

154
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,893
I brought a hot heating pack.

155
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,268
- She uses casual speech with everyone.
- Really?

156
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:36,397
See?
She's the casual speaking type, too!

157
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:39,827
- I love people like that.
- Ye Seul, let's just talk comfortably.

158
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,489
- Ye Seul, let's speak in casually.
- Okay!

159
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,862
[Let's all become good friends
with one another.]

160
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,368
- I didn't know Ye Seul was like this.
- She's so laid back.

161
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,121
- Ye Seul.
- What?

162
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,609
[Nothing but laughter with Ye Seul around.]

163
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,844
- Did you get to chat on the way?
- We talked the whole way here.

164
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,775
- We're on casual terms with Ye Seul already.
- We're good friends already.

165
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:04,200
- Sang Jin also told us...
- She lowers her speech with everyone.

166
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:08,154
Director, did you already eat?

167
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,854
[Wow, what a feeling...]

168
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,522
[The birth of Running Man's cutie.]

169
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:20,019
The Director's face has turned beet red.

170
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,787
[Time for Ji Hye to give it a try?]

171
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,606
Did ya eat?

172
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:30,747
- 'Did ya eat!'
- That's so cute, don't you know!

173
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,702
[Short and sweet country
dialect greeting.]

174
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:36,975
In keeping up with the theme of this park,
your first mission is train related.

175
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:40,237
Everyone will start to dance until
the sound of the horn is heard.

176
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,551
- Then we have to get on the train?
- Sit in this thing?

177
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:48,784
Two people per train are allowed, but
your butts have to be touching the seat.

178
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:51,260
It's possible that you could fit
even more per seat.

179
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:57,220
Only those who are seated will be passed
through to the snack tent over there.

180
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:01,224
[Find a seat and win the chance to enjoy
a hearty snack under the tent.]

181
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,793
I love dancing outside in the rain.

182
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,559
[Dancing fool, Yoo Hyuk, is excited at
the chance to dance with Ye Seul.]

183
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:13,473
If I were a black knight and I worked
really hard to win at these missions

184
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:15,995
then I'd have the chance to
swap out whomever I wanted, right?

185
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:18,092
Then can I swap myself out
knowing that I'm a black knight?

186
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,837
- What do you mean by that?
- If I were to be a black knight.

187
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,401
He must be a black knight.

188
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:27,284
[Everyone's convinced
that Kkuk is a black knight.]

189
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,638
[Could Kkuk really be a black knight?]

190
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:35,106
Isn't this game to
the black knight's advantage?

191
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:38,548
Even though we're teamed up this way,
there may be many white knights on our team.

192
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:42,200
Which means that Ha Ha could also be
a black knight. That remains a secret.

193
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,744
- Are you a black knight?
- Are you really a black knight?

194
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,485
No, I'm not! Ye Seul,
you have to believe me!

195
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:50,225
This is so unfair!
I won't stand for it.

196
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,515
- I'll believe you.
- You know what'll happen?

197
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:55,831
People who talk like you
are the real black knights.

198
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,168
[Could Yoo Hyuk be a black knight?]

199
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,028
Not saying anything is the
best thing to do.

200
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,732
- You're being suspicious.
- I don't trust you.

201
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:04,038
- How am I acting suspicious?
- Because you look like this right now.

202
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,000
[The look of betrayal on
Kwang Soo's face?]

203
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:10,319
- Since there are women...
- Then I'll play it rough.

204
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,016
- Really rough.
- Let's do this!

205
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,826
[Do they not go easy
on their guests on this show?]

206
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:18,456
I've mentioned something to
the writers in the past

207
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:21,338
about always playing such old
songs like songs from Turbo...

208
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,208
- What? Songs from Turbo?
- Those old songs...

209
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,035
[Getting a rise out of
the Twist King of the past.]

210
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,748
I want to see Ji Hye's
dance moves.

211
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,019
- Wang Ji Hye even does tumbling moves.
- Seriously?

212
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:38,302
[Country girl's tumbling moves?]

213
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,809
Wang Ji Hye!

214
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,636
What's tumbling?

215
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,773
[Ji Hye's slapstick comedy moves.]

216
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,384
[Always doing what's asked of her-
Birth of the new variety beauty, Ji Hye.]

217
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:07,267
[Board the train game- Start.]

218
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,867
[Party starters, Ha Ha and Gary.]

219
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,481
[Ye Seul is slowly getting
into the groove.]

220
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:16,715
[We're singers by day!]

221
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,992
[Shall we dance, Ye Seul?]

222
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,927
[Matching the theme of the dance-
Ye Seul and Ha Ha.]

223
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,072
[This beauty knows how to party!]

224
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,525
[Actor Joo is getting into it.]

225
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,761
[Wang Ji Hye, come on!]

226
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,976
[Han Sang Jin is on the move!]

227
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:52,070
[That's Yoo Hyuk's grasshopper dance!]

228
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,698
[Next up- Jung Gyu Woon.]

229
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:00,438
[Fancy footwork.]

230
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:05,611
[Jung Gyu Woon's retro dance moves.]

231
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:09,659
[Everybody say, Han Ye Seul!]

232
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,855
[Han Ye Seul, let's go!]

233
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:19,657
[Ye Seul's got the moves.]

234
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,922
[A fun dance party in the rain.]

235
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,064
[Let's go board the train!]

236
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:32,444
[Only those sitting on the seat when
the horn sounds, pass the round!]

237
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:35,403
[First ones in the left seat-
Han Ye Seul and Ji Suk Jin.]

238
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,526
No!

239
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,613
Go away!

240
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,729
[I'm not getting out of my seat!]

241
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,352
[Nine members' train battle.]

242
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,951
[Big-nose is forcibly
removed from his seat.]

243
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,330
[Chaos over the left seat.]

244
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,752
[On the other hand,
Ace and Kkuk's right seat...]

245
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:57,808
[Totally peaceful on
the icy side of the train.]

246
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,699
They're not even attempting
to come on our side.

247
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:03,306
[The left side is bursting with people.]

248
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,860
[Train boarding game-
End of the first round.]

249
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,722
[Everyone on the left side is disqualified,
and Ji Hyo and Jong Kook passes.]

250
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:16,585
- Why didn't anyone come over to us?
- You just want me out of the game.

251
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:19,328
- They're all trying to send me out.
- Just send him out of the game.

252
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,606
Only Kim Jong Kook and Song Ji Hyo
of the Blue Team pass.

253
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:27,438
Why didn't anyone even come over to us?
We were waiting for people to come.

254
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,252
- You can't succeed!
- You can't leave us!

255
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,248
- I didn't want to pass.
- We can officially get started now!

256
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,930
We're at a disadvantage
all of a sudden.

257
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:40,436
It's more advantageous for us to
send Jong Kook out first.

258
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,594
- We can officially get started now.
- That was no fun at all.

259
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:44,747
- Let's start over.
- No, you already passed.

260
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:48,569
- But that wasn't any fun at all.
- Having you in the game is even less fun.

261
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,267
[The battlefield is a cruel place to be.]

262
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,381
- That's not right.
- No, that's not right.

263
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:56,181
[Not wanting to step off the platform.]

264
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,677
- Start the music!
- Let's start the next round!

265
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,997
Dancing in the rain is...

266
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:07,296
[Sang Jin's pre-game slapstick humor.]

267
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,556
What's Sang Jin's deal?

268
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:15,375
We should be over there helping.

269
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,511
- My butt's all wet.
- You're a white knight, aren't you?

270
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,953
No, I'm a black knight.

271
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:24,091
- I know you're a white knight.
- No, I'm a black knight.

272
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,150
- You totally look like a white knight.
- No, I'm a black knight.

273
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,218
You said something earlier
that you shouldn't have said.

274
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,662
'We should be over there helping.'
Why else would you have said that?

275
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:34,190
You need to be there to help our
other teammates pass.

276
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:36,705
[We can talk later.
It's time to dance!]

277
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:39,193
- Grab onto each other's shoulders.
- Let's go!

278
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,081
Grab onto my shoulders.

279
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:45,018

[Yoo Hyuk whips his wet hair around.]

281
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,613
[Shake it!]

282
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,914
[This rain isn't going to stop
our dancing fever.]

283
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:59,204
Ugh, what the heck?

284
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,589
[Couple of uninvited guests
on the train ride.]

285
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,062
I feel so dizzy!

286
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:07,744
- I feel so dizzy!
- This is great!

287
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,463
Wang Ji Hye, take off your hat!
Let's enjoy the party!

288
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:21,797
[Giraffe!]

289
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,812

00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:52,003
[Sang Jin's thrown off to the side.]

296
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,018
I need to get onboard!

297
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,752
[Kwang Soo's interference is deterred.]

298

are onboard.]

[Han Ye Seul- Onboard.

305
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,718
He doesn't count, right?

Only Han Ye Seul, Joo Sang Wook,
and Wang Ji Hye pass.

307

sexy right now.

[Her wet hair is appealing
to all the males.]

310
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,195
Thank you.

311
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,222
[Befuddled]

312
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:51,435
- Is this how it normally is?
- This is how it normally is.

313
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,797
It's okay.

314
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,509
- Ji Hye's been hurt!
- What happened, Ji Hye?

315
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:03,844
- I thought my legs were being ripped off.
- I was doing it the other way.

316
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,359
- Ugh, seriously!
- Ji Hye's hurt.

317
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,562
- Ji Hye, are you okay?
- This is my first variety experience.

318
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,274
- No, I'm not okay.
- Why are you asking her that now?

319
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,320
- Why are you asking her that now?
- Are you okay?

320
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,603
- Ye Seul, are you okay?
- Wang Ji Hye, are you okay?

321
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,416

you're okay!

00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:27,164
- Did Ji Hye pass?
- There are only three of us left?

325
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:32,048
- You look so ugly right now.
- Should I put my hat back on?

326
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,182
Should I put my hat back on?
Is that better?

327
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:36,081
[Take a look in the mirror, Kwang Soo.]

328
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,831
[Perfectly in sync-
New variety duo- Giraffe and Ji Hye.]

329
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,966
[Meanwhile, in the snack tent...]

330
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,840
Five guests came on the show
today, right?

331
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,229
Since there are five guests,
the five guests are the white knights.

332
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,191
But I don't think they would've
grouped the guests together like that.

333
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,491
Because Ji Hyo...
I know that you're a white knight.

334
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,708
- No, I'm not!
- I know you are.

335
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,281
You're seriously so annoying!
No, I'm not!

336
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,425
- You're definitely a white knight.
- I'm a white knight.

337
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,301
- Jong Kook has to be white.
- I'm white.

338
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:07,953
I know he's white and he's just trying
to thwart the suspicion off of him.

339
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,373
[The debate over the identity of
the black and white knight continues on.]

340
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:13,588
[Gary passes the third round of the game.]

341
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,621
[Let's get into the groove!]

342
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,224
[Proposes belly butt pumping dance moves.]

343
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,985
[Sounds good!]

344
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,806
[Round four of the train game- Start.]

345
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:30,624
One, two, three, four!

346
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:37,531
[This is a real man's dance!]

347
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,741
[Giraffe's enthusiastic bounce.]

348
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,407
Stop it, that's enough!

349
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,562
[Addicting bounce moves.]

350
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:56,374
[Yoo Hyuk and Giraffe are in the midst
of formulating a plan.]

351
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,267
Move up to the front!
You have to move up!

352
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,564
[Yoo Hyuk marks Big-nose
as his target.]

353
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,192
[Even in the midst of all that,
'Yeah baby!']

354
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,474
[The Red Team's goal-
Stop Big-nose from boarding the train.]

355
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,082
[Big-nose can go to the back.]

356
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,806
[Or just lay down and get some rest.]

357
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:20,625
[Sang Jin takes another clumsy fall.]

358
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:25,773
[Red Team's plan-
Let Gyu Woon board the train first.]

359
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,852
[Yoo Hyuk isn't strong enough
to make it happen on his own.]

360
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:33,572
[Three men lift Gyu Woon up
to force him on the train.]

361
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:35,838
[The man's heated refusal.]

362
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:40,933
Oh no!

363
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,947
[Big-nose is held captive,
and Gyu Woon is forced.]

364
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:48,326
[Jung Gyu Woon is forced
aboard the train.]

365
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,007
[I can't let it end this way...]

366
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,590
Gyu Woon, you have to get out of there.

367
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,862
Hurry!

368
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:02,975
[Train game- Round four.
Jung Gyu Woon is forcibly passed.]

369
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:09,945
[If the strong Gyu Woon is
also out of the game, then...]

370
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:14,641
Congratulation to the Blue Team for
taking such a huge lead in the game.

371
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,287
What did you say?

372
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:20,773
- Did you say that we're now in the lead?
- Fighting, Suk Jin!

373
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:25,563
- You can do this!
- We're at a disadvantage, but we'll try.

374
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:27,404
We won't know until we try.

375
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:30,250
- White knights!
- Yes, that's me!

376
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:33,636
- Ye Seul, can you cheer us on?
- Cheer us on, Ye Seul.

377
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:37,698
- Stay strong!
- Say it in casual speech!

378
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:40,088
Ye Seul, say it in casual speech.

379
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,937
Stay strong.

380
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,777
[Enough to make us melt.]

381
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,445
[I can do this!]

382
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:50,240
I believe in you!

383
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:52,952
[Give me the strength!]

384
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:56,207
Wang Ji Hye!

385
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,061
Give me a cheer!

386
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:05,864
Suk Jin, think of your health,
and don't push yourself too hard!

387
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:11,227
- 'Think of your health!'
- Was that even a cheer?

388
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:15,527
Don't push yourself too hard!
You'll have other chances.

389
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:19,429
- What kind of a cheer is that?
- She says he'll have other chances.

390
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,939
[Two very different charms. Funny
beauty, Ji Hye and Cutie pie, Ye Seul.]

391
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:26,014
[Winners of the fifth round-
Yoo Jae Suk and Ha Ha.]

392
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,253
- Let's throw him off.
- Sang Jin, you're looking really pale.

393
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,923
[The perfect pale skin of
a white knight.]

394
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,678
- Get him a piece of chocolate.
- My hands are freezing.

395
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,969
[Piece of chocolate for
a little spurt of energy.]

396
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,176
[Train game- Round six.]

397
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,997
It's Song Ji Hyo's song!

398
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,686
It's Ji Hyo's song!

399
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,577
[Blank Ji on the move!]

400
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,368
Back in the day, we couldn't even
force Ji Hyo to go out there.

401
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,586
Why are you running out here?

402
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,124
What's wrong with you?

403
00:23:58,623 --> 00:24:00,543
[Blank Ji- Let's go!]

404
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:02,463
Wow, you're so shameless.

405
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,488
Go!

406
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:09,932
From the top of my head to
the tips of my toes, I'm a hot issue!

407
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:13,358
[Pale-faced Sang Jin on the
other hand...]

408
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,314
That's the only long standing
dance move she has.

409
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:28,003
[Moving over to Sang Jin-
A sudden couple dance time.]

410
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:30,375
- Do you know what you're doing?
- No!

411
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,863
[Everyone's following Blank Ji's moves.]

412
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,996
[Blue Team's Suk Jin vs
Red Team's Sang Jin and Kwang Soo.]

413
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:47,491
[Knocks him down to the ground.]

414
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:50,154
- Sang Jin!
- Let go of him.

415
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:53,075
Kwang Soo, just get on the train.

416
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,037
Sang Jin!

417
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,297
- Just get onboard, Kwang Soo.
- Are you sure?

418
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,850
[Why isn't he able to throw Suk Jin off?]

419
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:04,359
- Sang Jin's acting weird.
- I agree, he is acting weird.

420
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,341
- He's acting really weird.
- Three, two, one!

421
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,040
[Round six of the train game-
Lee Kwang Soo passes.]

422
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,281
- Sang Jin's much weaker than he looks.
- This game is never ending!

423
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,760
- This game is never ending.
- He's really strong.

424
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:21,533
- What are you talking about?
- No, he really is strong.

425
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,757
[He really is acting very suspicious...]

426
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,073
Everyone in the world knows
how weak Suk Jin is.

427
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,759
No, he really is very strong.

428
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:33,156
[Could this be because
Sang Jin is a black knight?]

429
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:40,100
Since it's now down to the two of you,
first one aboard the train wins the round.

430
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,230
Sang Jin!

431
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:48,404
If you don't make it this time, then
I'll know that you're a black knight.

432
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,488
[You can trust me.]

433
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:53,907
Ji Hye, give me a cheer.

434
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:59,454
Your health is what's most important.

435
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:02,146
[I shouldn't have asked...]

436
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:07,221
He's really worrying me.

437
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:13,023
[A neck to neck competition-
A battle amidst the fog...]

438
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,694
[Time for a little warm up.]

439
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:21,146
[Middle aged men's dance battle.]

440
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,495
[But in their hearts, they're
still hot and fiery young men.]

441
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:37,594
[Final train dance with the whole group.]

442
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,735
You two look like you're not even
interested in the game anymore.

443
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:46,537
[Fiercely competitive Jin-Jin couple.]

444
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:52,915
[I vow to win this round!]

445
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,537
[I can't let you beat me!]

446
00:26:56,884 --> 00:27:00,630
[Who will be the winner of this final round?]

447
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,827
[Sang Jin is first to board the train.]

448
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,922
[Han Sang Jin wins the final round.]

449
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,045
You were already in front of me
when they blew the horn.

450
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:18,117
Thus, the Red Team wins the first game.

451
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,854
[Red Team wins the Board the Train game.]

452
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:27,509
[Teammate swap is still left to do.]

453
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,487
Only the Queen will be notified of
how many black knights are on the team

454
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,320
and how many white knights
she has on her team.

455
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:42,417
You must deliberate very carefully and
choose which member you'd like to swap out.

456
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,875
[Ye Seul must choose one member of the Blue
Team whom she thinks is a white knight.]

457
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:49,218
[Time to check how many black and white
knights she currently has on the team.]

458
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:56,294
The number of white knights
you currently have on the team...

459
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:59,210
including yourself is...

460
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:04,501
Including yourself is... three.

461
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:07,283
[Total of three white knights
on the team.]

462
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:11,863
There are a total of three white knights
on your team including yourself

463
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,775
and the other two are black knights.

464
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:19,796
[Only three of the current
five members are white knights.]

465
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:29,747
[Members who chose the
white knight cards...]

466
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:33,775
[Just who could they be?]

467
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,290
Were you shocked by the results?

468
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,770
You have to be smart about this, Ye Seul.

469
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:38,837
[Have to bring the white knights
over from the Blue Team.]

470
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:42,719
[And kick the black knights
off the team.]

471
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,859
[Just who will Ye Seul choose?]

472
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,330
- Hey, Ye Seul.
- Stop it!

473
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:52,119
- Seriously.
- He would've been more helpful.

474
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,763
[The black knight is right over here.]
Wow, these guys are awful.

475
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:59,027
- They're so hateful.
- Who are we going to bring over?

476
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:05,208
Raise your hand if you weren't sure
who had which card when we first chose it.

477
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:08,416
- Anyone who felt confused.
- I was a bit confused.

478
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:12,321
- I was confused.
- You weren't sure who had which?

479
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,352
Why are you asking this question when
every one of us is confused about it.

480
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,473
Isn't there a higher chance that you're
a white knight if you felt confused by it?

481
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,651
Ye Seul's speech pattern
starts off at a higher octave.

482
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:26,082
- Happier she gets, higher her pitch becomes.
- She's like a soprano singer.

483
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,766
- Seriously.
- Jong Kook's songs would be a good pitch.

484
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,183
My songs would be the
perfect pitch for her.

485
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,793
[Even Actor Joo is getting
a laugh out of this one.]

486
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:37,723
I really like Ye Seul.

487
00:29:37,724 --> 00:29:44,901
For this first round, I'm going to swap out
two people who gave the best argument.

488
00:29:44,902 --> 00:29:46,702
[Trade off two people
who gave the best argument?]

489
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:51,428
[Who will Ye Seul choose?]

490
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:52,731
Good job, Ye Seul.

491
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:59,912
Red Team's Ha Ha for
Blue Team's Kim Jong Kook.

492
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:01,920
[Ha Ha for Kim Jong Kook.]

493
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:07,057
[Queen's selection-
Ha Ha for Jong Kook.]

494
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:13,530
[Did Ye Seul succeed in trading out a
black knight for a white knight?]

495
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,119
[Off to the second game location.]

496
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,807
Ye Seul, how many white knights
did he tell you are on the team?

497
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:24,062
- There aren't very many white knights.
- Right?

498
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:27,056
Didn't I tell you that there were only two?
That was surprising, wasn't it?

499
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:29,293
I told you that there were
only two, didn't I?

500
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,949
I'm sure that must've been
very surprising to hear.

501
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,256
- Look, there are mics.
- There are ten mics.

502
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:38,021
Is this where you want us?

503
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:42,885
- It must be a quiz battle.
- Be quiet, he's about to tell us.

504
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:47,521
Your second mission is,
Black and White Competition.

505
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:49,960
[Black and White Competition.]

506
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,120
We have prepared a variety of games

507
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:55,248
and once we reveal the game, you
must choose one member from the team

508
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:56,796
to step forward to play the game.

509
00:30:56,797 --> 00:31:02,113
All the members from the losing team
must come stand in front of the wind mic

510
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:05,939
and will be blown with a shot of air
if their representative loses.

511
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,268
- This could be disadvantageous for us.
- You're right.

512
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,294
I've heard from good sources that
Wang Ji Hye used to be quite the partier.

513
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,927
I also heard from someone else

514
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:18,634
that if someone confesses their feelings for
Ji Hye in the winter, she always accepts.

515
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:23,972
[Buddy Kwang Soo's ambush attack.]

516
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,635
She always accepts love confessions
if they're made in the winter?

517
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:30,387
There's not much time left
until the end of the year.

518
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,909
Ugh, he's driving me crazy.

519
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,748
- Is her temper starting to flare up?
- I like this.

520
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:40,437
- I know one of Kwang Soo's secrets, too.
- What is it?

521
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:43,471
- Should I tell them?
- Sorry, I won't do it again.

522
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:45,675
- What is it?
- No, tell us!

523
00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:47,637
I know one of your secrets, too.

524
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,097
- What is it? Tell us.
- Why are you getting so nervous?

525
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:53,452
[Stay tuned.]

526
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,146
[A battle of revelation is
headed your way.]

527
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:02,609
[These two best friends seem to know
all there is to know about each other.]

528
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:06,095
First category is- Butt wrestling.

529
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:12,964
The first person to push the opponent off
with their butt and pick up the radish

530
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,829
on the ground wins the game.

531
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,301
- Who should go first? Me?
- Yeah, you go first.

532
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,986
I'll go first.
I'll take the first round.

534
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,530
[Gyu Woon for the Blue Team.]

535
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,657
[A formidable opponent from
the start.]

536
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,445
The loser team will get the shot of air
before sending out the next player.

537
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:37,157
We're at a disadvantage for having
a lesser number of players.

538
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:40,365
- Gyu Woon's a strong player.
- Don't be nervous!

539
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:44,275
[An enthusiastic cheer from
the two teams.]

540
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,381

[Yes, we know.]

I totally know what it is.

549
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:18,708

flowing down to that part of his body.]

Wang Ji Hye!

[Jae Suk chooses Ji Hye
as his next opponent.]

562
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,672
We have fewer players on our team,
so we have to win this round.

[Selected a female opponent to
give his team an upper hand.]

564

to make her counterattack.]

[Bravo, Wang Ji Hye!]

570
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,145
How did she do that?

571
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,939
- How did you do that?
- She did it after him.

572
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:03,836
What were you doing?

573
00:35:04,472 --> 00:35:06,912
[Timed her attack to use
Jae Suk's strength.]

574
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,906
Pick Jong Kook.

575
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:13,275
- He's weak when it comes to women.
- Then... I choose Jong Kook.

576
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:16,714
- Why are you choosing me?
- I've always been a fan of yours.

and send her flying off in the air.

to push him off?]

were you?

585
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,500
- Not this, right?
- Please don't do that.

586
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:48,862
- Wang Ji Hye's no joke.
- Wow, how did she beat Jae Suk?

587
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,201
- Was it on purpose?
- No, I swear it wasn't.

588

- Did you lose on purpose?
- What are you talking about?

589
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,418
- You're acting suspicious.
- Did you lose on purpose?

590

[A black knight's scheme to
destroy the queen's plans?]

591
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,659
- No, I doubt that.
- It's possible if you're a black knight.

592
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,885
Let's keep an eye on him, Ye Seul.

593
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:13,200
- You can only use your butts.
- Okay.

594
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:16,220
No, wait.

595
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:19,798
[Losing gets you suspected of being a
black knight, so must win the game.]

596
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,444
What's wrong?
Seriously? I didn't push very hard.

597
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,476
- Yes, that's the way to do it!
- I'm sorry.

598

[Butt Wrestling-
Red Team: 2 vs Blue Team: 1.]

599

We would've lost all the rounds if Ye Seul
hadn't traded Ha Ha for Jong Kook.

600

[Blue Team's next player-
Sang Wook.]

601

Make it quick and make
Sang Wook get some rest.

603
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:59,199

- Wait.

[Red Team wins the first game of

608
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:30,445
Jong Kook really must be a
white knight.

609
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:33,091
- Of course, I am.
- I think so too.

610
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:35,519
If Ye Seul gets to make another trade,
it would've been obvious

611
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,259
but seeing how hard Jong Kook's working,
I really do think he's a white knight.

612
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,421
Yes, he's working very hard.

613
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:42,436
But a black knight could
work just as hard.

614
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,527
- Yes, to remain on the team.
- That's right.

real dirty player.

Should we play a round of
'Of Course' first?

00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,729
- What are you talking about?
- That sounds like fun.

628
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,180
- Why do you want to play that?
- That sounds like real fun.

players seem excited by the idea.]

633
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:45,479
- Doesn't it sound fun!
- That sounds fun!

634
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,083
- Okay, a round of 'Of Course.'
- So many things I'm curious about.

635
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:50,438
You just reply 'Of Course' to
everything. Okay?

636
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,538
Yes, I understand.

637
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,189
- I'm not familiar with this game.
- Just answer 'Of Course' to everything.

638
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,339
If you don't, then you lose.
Are you both ready?

639
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,759
- Would you like to go first?
- Is this how we'll decide who goes first?

640

What? Yes, this is how
we'll decide who goes first.

- By any chance...
- Don't do it.

You've dated a celebrity before,
haven't you?

646
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,588
- One, two, three.
- That wasn't a bad question.

647
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:21,341
Of course.

648
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,961

Ji Hye's angry right now.

650
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:29,090
Ji Hye's getting angry.

651
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:33,069
This isn't how you play it!
You can't start off so strong!

652
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,430
You have to start off lightly.

653
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:38,459
[Is that... how you play it?]

654
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,826
Ji Hye's turn.

655
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:41,848
Look at the expression on her face.

656
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:46,570
- You can ask him the same question.
- You've dated a celebrity before, right?

657
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:49,635
- You've dated a celebrity before, right?
- What did she say?

658
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,040
- I doubt he has.
- Can't hear you. What did you say?

659
00:39:54,564 --> 00:39:59,273
[Same question, different weight.
Could be a knockout question.]

660
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:01,352
Pull yourself together, Kwang Soo.

661
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:04,566
- Of course!
- There you go. Next question.

662
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,248
- Ask her something strong.
- While filming...

663
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:11,462
have you ever felt attracted to any
of the actors that you've worked with?

664
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:18,019
- If she's ever felt attracted or not?
- Have you ever felt attracted to a co-star?

665
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,424
Can I just say 'Of course'
to win the game?

666
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,857
- Sure, that's fine.
- Yes, just think of it like that.

667
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,509
- Of course.
- Good.

668
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:28,670
You've had a co-star go from being
a 'sister' to a 'honey', haven't you?

669
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:31,431
[You've had a co-star go from being
a 'sister' to a 'honey', haven't you?]

670
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:33,500
From a 'sister' to a 'honey'?

671
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:38,586
[She's... tough.]

672
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:41,688
Hey!

673
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:45,076
I haven't played many roles
where I had a sister!

674
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,952
She's going too far.

675
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:53,329
[Giraffe explodes.]

676
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,133
[Kwang Soo's knocked down,
and Wang Ji Hye wins.]

677
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:03,889
[The power of being best friends-
Knocks him out with two simple blows.]

678
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,786
Wang Ji Hye's good.
Okay, Ji Hye can choose.

679
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:09,350
[Kwang Soo must correctly guess whether
the number of kernels are odd or even.]

680
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:11,326
I don't know how I'm ever going to
watch you on dramas anymore.

681
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:13,475
Wow, she really is different.

682
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,483
I'll never be able to
take her seriously again.

683
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,277
Odd!

684
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:27,439
I sincerely want you to win.

685
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,445
What is that all about?

686
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:30,477
She's giving him a chance
to change his mind.

687
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:31,699
I've never seen anything like this.

688
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,642
Just how many games are
they showing us?

689
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,665
They're so entertaining to watch.

690
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:44,069
You said odd, and she just told you
that she wants you to win.

691
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,227
- Change your answer.
- It's a mental game.

692
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:50,259
[Can I really trust you?]

693
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:53,566
[Don't you trust me, my friend?]

694
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,154
[I trust you.]

695
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:57,492
Even!

696
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,416
- What is it?
- Three.

697
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,567
[Three - Odd.]

698
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,103
[You, come here!]

699
00:42:13,148 --> 00:42:16,802
[Don't try to stop me!]

700
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:21,003
[This beauty's never before seen
4D personality.]

701
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:26,511
[Wang Ji Hye single handedly wins
the second game of Odd-Even.]

702
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:28,634
Wang Ji Hye totally fooled us.

703
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:32,364
[This is just the beginning.]

704
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,009
Here's your next game.

705
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,852
- Your next game is...
- Yes?

706
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:39,966
- It's the Hand slap Game.
- Ah, this?

707
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:43,012
You've all probably played
the game when you were younger.

708
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:45,426
- Should I go? I'll go.
- Kwang Soo has big hands.

709
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:47,747
[Kwang Soo for the Red Team.]

710
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,432
He's pretty slow though.

711
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,233
[Ha Ha for the Blue Team.]

712
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:53,737
- Okay.
- You have to do the attack.

713
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,068
[Being on the attack is more
advantageous in the hand slapping game.]

714
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,612
[Ha Ha on the attack.]

715
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,877
- You have to keep it on the mark.
- Don't put your hand any lower yet.

716
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:16,366
You have to leave it here.
Stick your hand on the mark.

717
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,972
I'm so scared!

718
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,240
- Kwang Soo.
- Why is his hand shaking?

719
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:26,851
I'm going to smack it as soon
as the whistle blows.

720
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,519
- You have to leave it on the mark.
- Just go with your gut.

721
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:33,308
Don't you think that his hand is
positioned too close?

722
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,379
Then do you think I should
have it up this high?

723
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,400
[Pulls his hand away at lightning speed.]

724
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,743
His hand has to be on it for me to
do it. Just leave it on the mark.

725
00:43:46,744 --> 00:43:48,849
Kwang Soo, it's only for 30 seconds.

726
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,345
[Giraffe can't keep his hand still
as if the table is a hot grill.]

727
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:57,202
[Nonstop high speed movement.]

728
00:43:57,841 --> 00:44:00,169
I'm going to wait until he exhausts
himself. Good going.

729
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,105
Yes, you're doing great.

730
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,918
You're doing great.
Okay.

731
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:12,681
[Spectators and the players alike
are feeling the same nervous energy.]

732
00:44:12,682 --> 00:44:15,009
Five, four...

733
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:21,474
[Hand slap- Round one.
Kwang Soo wins.]

734
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:28,076
- Good job, Kwang Soo.
- He's really good.

735
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:35,806
[Feels like he's lost his arm
in order to win this round.]

736
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,443
Do it right now while he's
already exhausted.

737
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,884
- You have to attack this time.
- You'd better be the attacker this time.

738
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:46,299
- It's hard to play two rounds in a row.
- Kwang Soo's going to get it.

739
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,091
What if he collapses after this round?

740
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,377
[Playing mind games as soon as
he joins the game.]

741
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,346
Attack!

742
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,556
[Please give me a break.]

743
00:45:00,373 --> 00:45:02,683
You can do this, Kwang Soo.

744
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:05,624
- You can do this, Kwang Soo.
- You can do this.

745
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:08,874
- What if he gets too exhausted?
- It's okay.

746
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,331
[The high speed movement starts again.]

747
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:15,615
Just let me know when there's
only five seconds left on the clock.

748
00:45:19,772 --> 00:45:22,252
Kwang Soo, you're starting
to slow down.

749
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,720
- Hey, you're slowing down too much.
- Kwang Soo.

750
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:35,478
[Hand slap- Round Two.
Joo Sang Wook wins.]

751
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:36,960
Good job.

752
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:42,206
[Hand slap game-
Red Team: 1 vs Blue Team: 1.]

753
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:46,426
Rock, paper, scissors.

754
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:48,107
Attack!

755
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:54,084
[High-speed defense move
that's good for one round.]

756
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:58,806
- Show them what you've got.
- You can win this round.

757
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,066
[Very high speed.]

758
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:04,995
Wow, he's so quick!

759
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,314
- Wait like 20 seconds.
- Go from one end to the other.

760
00:46:10,315 --> 00:46:12,514
- Not just in that small area.
- From one end of the table to the other?

761
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:15,155
[Total concentration.]

762
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:17,180
Let me know when there are
only five seconds left on the clock.

763
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,720
[The final round of the second game.]

764
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:27,628
- No, not yet.
- You have to make him feel on edge!

765
00:46:27,629 --> 00:46:30,310
You have to make him feel nervous
to make his hand move faster.

766
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:33,681
- That's right! He's moving fast now.
- That's pretty fast.

767
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:40,439
[The end all to the game.]

768
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,449
- Faster, you're moving too slow.
- Faster!

769
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,198
Faster!

770
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:53,808
[Five seconds left.]

771
00:47:01,492 --> 00:47:05,269
[Right on the mark.]

772
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:10,648
[Hand slap game- Round Three.
Yoo Jae Suk wins.]

773
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:14,171
[Second mission- Red Team wins.]

774
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:21,179
[Red Team wins another Queen's
chance with another win.]

775
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,479
We may have the queen here, but
the other team has the king (Wang).

776
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,347
[The birth of a 4D Beauty,
Wang Ji Hye.]

777
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:31,781
The current number of knights
you have on the team are...

778
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:37,110
a total of three white knights,
and two black knights.

779
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:39,707
[Huh?]

780
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:46,784
<i>You currently have a total of
three white knights on your team.</i>

781
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:51,865
[He clearly said there were three white
knights and two black knights earlier.]

782
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:57,553
[Even after having swapped
Ha Ha out for Jong Kook...]

783
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:01,262
[The number of white knights on her team
still remains unchanged?]

784
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,881
[In that case...]

785
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,332
I have no idea what
the answer is!

786
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,613
She should've gotten the answer,
but I guess she didn't.

787
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:12,902
What's the hint you were given?
Tell us what he told you.

788
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:16,690
The hint he gave was very confusing.
This is a bad situation.

789
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:23,908
First, it's easier to try to figure this out
since we have a fewer number of players.

790
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,428
Because there are fewer of us.

791
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:30,494
Then I want someone from my team to
tell me if they're not one of my people.

792
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:33,679
Can't you tell just by looking?
Your Highness.

793
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,271
[We're all your people!]

794
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:38,999
- Did you not see how hard I worked?
- Think about the games we just played.

795
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,852
[They're all arguing
that they're a white knight.]

796
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,076
Black knights are going to keep
arguing that they're white knights, right?

797
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:48,433
Look at how white my face is, Ye Seul.

798
00:48:48,434 --> 00:48:52,985
- But you were really bad at the games.
- I can't help the fact that I'm bad at it.

799
00:48:52,986 --> 00:48:55,923
- I'm just bad at playing games.
- I'm a white knight.

800
00:48:55,924 --> 00:48:59,656
- I'm just naturally bad at games.
- Okay, in that case...

801
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:02,359
I'm sorry that you're bad
at playing games.

802
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,527
I only want strong players
on my team.

803
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:07,542
[Han Sang Jin is kicked out
for being a bad game player.]

804
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:09,920
- I knew it!
- We're good.

805
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:14,167
- We have to win, don't we?
- You made the right decision.

806
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,945
Ye Seul.

807
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:20,012
- This is so frustrating.
- Choose a member of the Blue Team.

808
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:24,434
I'm going to swap Han Sang Jin out
and bring Ha Ha back in.

809
00:49:24,435 --> 00:49:28,171
I'm going to swap these two out

810
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:31,800
because then I'll be able to tell
one way or the other from the trade.

811
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,423
[Han Sang Jin out,
and Ha Ha back in.]

812
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:46,320
[Did Ye Seul succeed in swapping out
a black knight for a white knight?]

813
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,476
[Off to the next mission location.]

814
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:54,098
You look really pretty under
the lighting in this car.

815
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:55,445
Really?

816
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:58,420
- I don't look funny?
- No way.

817
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:07,566
Seeing how Ye Seul brought Ha Ha back in,
it really must've been very confusing.

818
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,623
- There's something I'm curious about.
- Yeah?

819
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:13,741
Do you think Song Ji Hyo
is white or black?

820
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,258
- Ji Hyo?
- She's definitely black.

821
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:20,370
- It's more probable that she's black.
- She's been too quiet to be a white knight.

822
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,573
Wow, this is really hard.

823
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:27,456
To be honest, I'm a black knight.
I have to get on the other team.

824
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,315
Then we're all black knights?

825
00:50:29,316 --> 00:50:31,683
No matter what the case,
we can't lose Sang Wook

826
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:33,867
- because that would be too confusing.
- No, I need to get to the other team.

827
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:36,115
If Sang Wook goes, then we're in trouble.

828
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:39,720
You can't go.
Anyone else but you can go.

829
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:44,138
- No, I'll just go. Let's just win this.
- No, we can't let you leave.

830
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:46,175
- We can't let you leave.
- We need to win.

831
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,511
[Sang Wook keeps trying to leave this
team. What is his true identity?]

832
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:54,001
This is the place.

833
00:50:54,002 --> 00:50:55,850
[The last game site before
the final selection round.]

834
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,257
There's a restaurant.

835
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:05,737
[A traditional market full of
warmth and delicious foods.]

836
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:09,455
I wonder if we'll get to eat at
one of these restaurants in here.

837
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:12,182
- I see 'R' stickers everywhere.
- I see it.

838
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:14,573
Why are there 'R' stickers
everywhere?

839
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:18,321
[Now that they take a closer look,
'R' stickers are seen everywhere.]

840
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:21,440
And all the doors have been papered up
so we can't look inside.

841
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:27,385
- Hello.
- Wow, it's vegetable pancakes.

842
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,657
- Can we have a pancake?
- Sure, help yourselves.

843
00:51:30,372 --> 00:51:32,577
- We can really eat some?
- Yes, go ahead.

844
00:51:32,578 --> 00:51:35,941
Thank you so much. Freshly made
vegetable pancakes are so delicious.

845
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,437
- We really can eat some?
- Wow, that looks so delicious.

846
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:44,277
They came just to make you these
in case you were hungry.

847
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:46,777
[They've been waiting for them to arrive so
that they could make pancakes for them.]

848
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:48,359
Thank you for coming to
visit us in Gangwondo.

849
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,361
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- We really can eat some?

850
00:51:50,362 --> 00:51:53,976
[Gangwondo's warm hospitality that can
be felt straight through to their hearts.]

851
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,501
- Thank you for the food.
- These are the best on rainy days.

852
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,036
Wow, it's still hot.

853
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:02,488
[Chive pancakes hot and
fresh off the pan.]

854
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,706
Eat plenty before you go.

855
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,132
It's perfect with the rain outside.

856
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:11,615
[Chive pancakes on a rainy day.]

857
00:52:11,616 --> 00:52:13,963
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

858
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:18,389
[Blue Team also smells the delicious
scent of the food.]

859
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,968
It's so delicious.

860
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,606
Wow, it's so good.

861
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:28,716
[Even more delicious with the warmth
and love of the ladies added in.]

862
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:36,457
It's a hand warmer.

863
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:38,475
[Kwang Soo quietly slips a
hand warmer in the lady's hand.]

864
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:42,763
[What a warm hearted kid.]

865
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,768
Thank you for such a delicious treat.

866
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:48,571
Thank you for a delicious treat.
Please always be healthy.

867
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:51,036
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- Come back again.

868
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:57,951
[Thank you to the ladies who warmed up
not only our bellies, but our hearts as well.]

869
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:03,781
[Off to the mission site with
their bellies full of pancakes.]

870
00:53:03,782 --> 00:53:05,781
Wow, that was unbelievable.

871
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:11,454
No matter who wins the final mission, you'll
get the chance to swap out two people.

872
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:16,142
[A chance to swap out two people
no matter who wins the final mission.]

873
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:17,832
[I have to win this no matter what.]

874
00:53:18,588 --> 00:53:20,902
We're all black knights,
so it doesn't matter who goes.

875
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:24,404
- So you've decided you're a black knight?
- Me? No, I haven't.

876
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:26,146
[Sang Jin's suddenly decided
that he's also a black knight?]

877
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:32,541
- I really am a white knight.
- Don't lie when the cameras aren't rolling.

878
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,786
[Sang Jin kept chatting Ye Seul up
even when the cameras weren't rolling.]

879
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,217
No, I really am a white knight.

880
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,552
You're really starting to
resemble Joo Young Hoon.

881
00:53:44,553 --> 00:53:46,964
What are you talking about?
Don't say things like that!

882
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,127
What's wrong with that guy?

883
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:55,944
- He's really starting to resemble him.
- I thought he was English for a minute.

884
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:59,256
- A nice English man.
- No, I'm a nice white knight.

885
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:02,411
Your next mission is,
Market Memory Mission.

886
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:05,755
You are in the center of the market.
You came in from the far end.

887
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,330
It's equal distance to
the other side of the market.

888
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,352
There are storefronts with
an 'R' sticker on the door.

889
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:14,835
We've also papered up the doors
to these lovely storefronts.

890
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:18,755
The reason being, behind
the doors of those storefronts

891
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:23,163
your opponents will be posed in different
positions which you'll have to memorize

892
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:25,909
and reenact the pose
once you get back.

893
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,602
Even though the seven of you will only
need to remember five different poses

894
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:33,000
the five of you must memorize the poses
assumed by these seven people.

895
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:36,801
Even if one person fails to reenact,
then the whole team fails the mission.

896
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:38,767
I'm going to take off my pants.

897
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:41,567
The Red Team can go out
into the market.

898
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:44,279
- We should split up.
- I don't know what pose to make.

899
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,191
[Red Team to be the first
to assume positions.]

900
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:51,030
[They must first choose an 'R'
marked store to hide in.]

901
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:56,176
Hello.
May I come in for a minute?

902
00:54:58,064 --> 00:54:59,943
What's a pose that only I can assume?

903
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,270
[It's crucial to assume a position
that their opponents can't imitate.]

904
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:05,039
- Can you help me out for a second?
- With what?

905
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,978
- Can you pull my leg up over my head?
- You think you can do that?

906
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:12,546
That's going to be really tough.
You're going to hurt yourself.

907
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:15,525
Kwang Soo, you're going to
pull off your leg.

908
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,750
What am I going to do?

909
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:24,593
[Jae Suk steps into
an 'R' marked blanket store.]

910
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:26,338
I'm sorry, but may I
impose on you for a moment?

911
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:27,869
Yes, of course.

912
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,161
Ugh, that hurts.

913
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:40,639
[How can I pose
so that they can't imitate it?]

914
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:46,003
I don't think I can do this.

915
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:49,869
This is my last chance, isn't it?
I really have to win this.

916
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,506
By any chance, do you know
who the black knights are?

917
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:56,560
- You have no idea?
- No, I wouldn't know.

918
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:59,996
You're no help.

919
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:01,283
[Had he known, he would've folded
under Ye Seul's charm.]

920
00:56:01,284 --> 00:56:05,128
I'm in a really bad situation right now,
so I need to win this mission.

921
00:56:05,507 --> 00:56:07,894
There is one thing that I've
thought of.

922
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:15,584
One, two, three, fighting!

923
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:20,432
[Market Memory Mission-
Blue Team on the move!]

924
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,145
We'll go to the right.

925
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:28,492
Where are the 'R' marked doors?

926
00:56:28,493 --> 00:56:32,103
[They must find the stores that the
Red Team members are hiding behind.]

927
00:56:32,104 --> 00:56:35,851
[The Red Team members are behind only
five of these numerous marked doors.]

928
00:56:41,758 --> 00:56:43,440
Where are they?

929
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,956
[The clock is ticking...]

930
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:54,417
[You came?]

931
00:56:58,286 --> 00:57:00,975
[Try your best to imitate me.]

932
00:57:01,526 --> 00:57:03,463
What the heck is this!

933
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,774
I don't want to!

934
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:13,139
[A finger up his nose,
and a sock in his mouth.]

935
00:57:14,008 --> 00:57:17,107
[Twisted Ha Ha confusing his opponent
with only one sock off his foot.]

936
00:57:18,056 --> 00:57:20,743
[Must return to the cafe
after memorizing the pose.]

937
00:57:20,744 --> 00:57:22,641
Why isn't this opening?

938
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:24,495
[What is the pose that Ji Hye
walked in on?]

939
00:57:24,496 --> 00:57:26,396
No way!

940
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:36,801
No way!

941
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:42,299
- How am I supposed to do that?
- This was meant for a guy, not a girl.

942
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,599
[Can't even figure out
what pose he's assuming.]

943
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,460
- Suk Jin!
- What?

944
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:48,353
[Of all people, the man she calls
over is... Big-nose.]

945
00:57:48,354 --> 00:57:50,323
- You take it.
- Why?

946
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:55,337
- What is that?
- A girl shouldn't be doing this.

947
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:59,342
Wait, what is this pose?
You're all twisted...

948
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,368
Why did you do this?

949
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,134
- What's this?
- Hi, Sang Wook.

950
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:08,850
What are you doing?

951
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:13,953
Why is she doing this?
You have an image to uphold.

952
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:17,552
[Queen Ye Seul is contorting her body
to find all her white knights.]

953
00:58:17,553 --> 00:58:19,540
How is that even possible?

954
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:25,125
She's lost her mind.
Stop laughing.

955
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,923
- I have to win this.
- It's okay to lose.

956
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:30,215
Are you black or white?

957
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,707
Don't know about that,
but how did you do this?

958
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:34,524
[Black or white?
Sang Wook's still mysterious identity.]

959
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:41,208
[What did Gyu Woon discover?]

960
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:45,243
[Crumpled up Kwang Soo.]

961
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:50,133
[A pose that he just wants to ignore.]

962
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:55,478
[But... Gyu Woon's doing it.]

963
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,684
You have to look at my fingers too.

964
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,736
You know that a lot of people can't do
what I'm doing with my finger.

965
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:08,955
[Blank Ji discovers, Thinking Yoo Hyuk.]

966
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,851
[Trying hard to hide his laughter.]

967
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,421
Okay!

968
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,909
Why did you have to assume
such a difficult pose?

969
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:24,930
[It's difficult for me, too.]

970
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:27,038
Ugh, my legs!

971
00:59:28,112 --> 00:59:30,618
- Like this.
- Time's almost up!

972
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:33,081
- He can't do it.
- You need to head back.

973
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:36,275
[Time's up.
Must go back to the meeting site.]

974
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:39,627
- I didn't see anyone.
- I don't know, but my legs hurt so bad.

975
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:41,637
Ugh, my legs.

976
00:59:44,407 --> 00:59:47,116
Okay, Gary was here first,
so we'll start with him.

977
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:51,157
In the market, Ha Ha can be found...

978
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:53,878
There you go.

979
00:59:54,403 --> 00:59:56,309
[A deep sigh of breath.]

980
01:00:01,585 --> 01:00:07,544
[A sock in his mouth...
and a finger right up his nose.]

981
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:11,681
In the market,
Yoo Jae Suk can be found...

982
01:00:11,682 --> 01:00:13,914
[Next up is- Blank Ji.
In the market, Yoo Jae Suk can be found.]

983
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:15,997
That looked really difficult.

984
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:20,204
[Oh? That looks pretty close...]

985
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,624
- No, she got it wrong.
- In the market, Kwang Soo can be found...

986
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,599
[Gyu Woon's turn.]

987
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:28,539
[He can't possibly...]

988
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:41,797
[He's actually doing it!]

989
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:43,304
He can actually do this?

990
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:46,410
[Amazing, Jung Gyu Woon.]

991
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:49,815
In the market, Kim Jong Kook can be found...
I don't know if I can imitate it.

992
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,578
What are you doing?

993
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,728
Gyu Woon can't hold that pose for
too long.

994
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:03,214
[Hurry, Suk Jin.]

995
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,532
In the market, Han Ye Seul
can be found too.

996
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,723
- But I had no idea she'd do that.
- Hurry up.

997
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:13,251
She's so weird, and I can't do it.
It's not a pose meant for a man.

998
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,992
- Hurry.
- But I can't do it like that.

999
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:17,438
Just hurry up and do it!

1000
01:01:21,743 --> 01:01:27,382
[While Sang Wook wastes time...
Gyu Woon starts to falter.]

1001
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,653
Gyu Woon's hooking his finger
in his mouth because he's struggling.

1002
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:31,711
You're going to rip your mouth.

1003
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:34,663
A man's hips can't spread out like that.

1004
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:38,189
[Sang Wook explains the pose to Ji Hye.]

1005
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,723
No, not like that.
Just lay flat on your back.

1006
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,551
No, a man can't do that.

1007
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:48,336
- Wang Ji Hye's flexible.
- She's so flexible.

1008
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,766
[Ji Hye's just as flexible as Ye Seul is.]

1009
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,660
Yes, do it just like that.

1010
01:01:54,814 --> 01:01:57,856
Okay, all five members are in position.
Their poses are...

1011
01:01:57,857 --> 01:02:01,684
[Did everyone get it perfectly?]

1012
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:08,908
[Ha Ha-Gary.
A perfect match.]

1013
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:12,905
[Ye Seul- Ji Hye.
A perfect match.]

1014
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,787
[Kwang Soo- Gyu Woon.
A perfect match.]

1015
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:19,316
[Jae Suk- Ji Hyo. Arms on the
wrong side. Not a match.]

1016
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:22,807
[Jong Kook- Suk Jin.
Mismatched in every way.]

1017
01:02:23,612 --> 01:02:27,143
[Blue Team fails the first attempt.]

1018
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:29,040
Ji Hyo posed in the opposite direction.

1019
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,245
Wow, Gyu Woon imitated it perfectly.

1020
01:02:33,141 --> 01:02:35,495
[Kwang Soo's doppelganger, Gyu Woon.]

1021
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:39,945
It's time for the Blue Team to go out
and assume their positions.

1022
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:41,743
Okay, you may go and get started.

1023
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:46,561
If I find a woman posing,
then I'll call out for Ye Seul.

1024
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,619
If any one of us finds a girl,
then call out for Ye Seul.

1025
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:54,833
[Blue Team on the move.]

1026
01:02:58,249 --> 01:03:00,676
I don't think I can do this move.

1027
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:04,253
What difficult pose can I assume?

1028
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:10,591
[Contorting their bodies in
every which direction.]

1029
01:03:14,716 --> 01:03:18,291
- Three, two, one. Start!
- Let's go.

1030
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:21,227
[Market memory mission- Red Team.]

1031
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,573
[With fewer members on their team, they
must move faster to find their opponents.]

1032
01:03:28,627 --> 01:03:30,643
Is no one here?
There's no one here.

1033
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,109
There's no one here.

1034
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:38,421
I found Gary.
What the heck!

1035
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,715
What the heck!

1036
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,629
[I'm the dance King of Jamsil,
Kang Gary!]

1037
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,387
What the heck!

1038
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,910
Do you think you can do this?

1039
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,934
[Try and imitate me.
Gary showing off his skills.]

1040
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:53,725
- That's too hard.
- Jong Kook!

1041
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:56,872
- Hey, Jong Kook!
- Only Jong Kook can do this.

1042
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:58,843
[Immediately gives up.]

1043
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:02,842
[Meanwhile...]

1044
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:06,331
[Face-off with a boneless mollusk.]

1045
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:09,748
[Namaste]

1046
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:13,354
[Ji Hye assumes the twisted
doughnut position.]

1047
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:16,390
Ye Seul!
Come over here right now!

1048
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:19,582
Hurry!
You have to look very closely.

1049
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:21,924
- Seriously.
- What are you doing!

1050
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:28,487
Cover the face with the left hand,
and the right hand is bent like this.

1051
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,403
Ye Seul, this is really painful.

1052
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:35,361
[Jae Suk already gave up on Gary,
what will he find this time?]

1053
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:39,179
It's Sang Wook.
I think I can do this one.

1054
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,847
[Sang Wook, the Samson.]

1055
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,463
I think I can do Sang Wook's pose.
Okay, three fingers.

1056
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:46,049
[Sang Wook holds the tough pose
on only three fingers.]

1057
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,602
I just saw Sang Wook.

1058
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:53,354
[Ha Ha discovers Sang Jin.]

1059
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:58,603
Okay, left foot, right foot and hat.
Left foot, right foot, and hat.

1060
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,846
Left foot...

1061
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:07,386
The socks are in the shoes,
and the hat is placed...

1062
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:09,286
[Nice English man's difficult pose.]

1063
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,962
- You can do this, right?
- No, I can't do this.

1064
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:15,522
[Ji Hyo's yoga pose.]

1065
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:17,317
- I can't do this.
- You have to do it!

1066
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:20,070
The left hand is...

1067
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:26,346
Wow, this is really confusing.
I have to put this where?

1068
01:05:26,347 --> 01:05:28,191
[Big-nose puts his nose to a good use.]

1069
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:30,241
Okay, the right foot.

1070
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,414
- Did you get it?
- The right foot...

1071
01:05:33,415 --> 01:05:35,374
Did he memorize it already?

1072
01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:40,326
[Time's up.
Back to the meeting site.]

1073
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:43,209
- How are we going to get seven poses?
- I heard Wang Ji Hye's pose was tough?

1074
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,312
[Ji Hye's shocking body twist.]

1075
01:05:46,313 --> 01:05:48,743
Ji Hye, have you studied yoga?

1076
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,742
I took one class.

1077
01:05:50,743 --> 01:05:52,395
[Ye Seul's addicting melodic speech.]

1078
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:54,189
'Hey, have you studied yoga?'

1079
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,183
We'll get started with Yoo Jae Suk.

1080
01:05:56,184 --> 01:05:58,389
[Time to start imitating.]

1081
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,245
In the market, Joo Sang Wook
can be found...

1082
01:06:00,246 --> 01:06:02,100
No one other than Jong Kook
can do it.

1083
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:05,736
You have to move fast
as not to make it tough for others.

1084
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:07,949
[On three fingers only.
Will Jae Suk succeed?]

1085
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,373
[Oh!]

1086
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:12,401
[Jae Suk succeeds.]

1087
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,339
In the market,
Song Ji Hyo can be found...

1088
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,811
[Time to imitate Blank Ji's pose.]

1089
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:19,843
[Kwang Soo also succeeds.]

1090
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:22,306
In the market, Ji Suk Jin can be found...

1091
01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:25,649
[Jong Kook easily succeeds.]

1092
01:06:27,763 --> 01:06:29,890
[Also succeeds in imitating
Sang Jin's confusing set up.]

1093
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:32,920
In the market,
Wang Ji Hye can be found...

1094
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:34,621
[The problem is, Ji Hye's twisted pose.]

1095
01:06:38,115 --> 01:06:39,700
She can't do it.

1096
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,306
No, you can do it.

1097
01:06:42,307 --> 01:06:43,907
[Wow, Ye Seul succeeds!]

1098
01:06:45,951 --> 01:06:48,542
[Five poses are successfully imitated.]

1099
01:06:49,392 --> 01:06:52,721
[Still left are Gary and
Gyu Woon's poses.]

1100
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:54,493
In the market, Gary can be found...

1101
01:06:55,296 --> 01:06:57,102
Ugh, Gary's pose...

1102
01:06:58,024 --> 01:07:00,303
- Gary's pose.
- I've never done it before.

1103
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:05,758
You know that move...
'Freeze' or whatever.

1104
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,370
[Kkuk steps in to give it a try.]

1105
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,418
[Wow, succeeds on first try.]

1106
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:21,182
Okay, we have one more.

1107
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:24,039
[One pose still remains.]

1108
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,076
[After all they've done,
no one saw Gyu Woon's pose!]

1109
01:07:31,963 --> 01:07:38,006
[Even though he waited and waited
until his tongue started cramping up...]

1110
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:41,304
[Still no one came.]

1111
01:07:41,305 --> 01:07:43,592
- No one came.
- You did well.

1112
01:07:46,465 --> 01:07:48,847
[Recovers from his cramps with
Grandpa's comforting words.]

1113
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:53,868
Red Team fails.

1114
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:58,885
[Until one of the team succeeds!
Red Team steps back out for more posing.]

1115
01:07:58,886 --> 01:08:00,992
We're at a definite disadvantage.

1116
01:08:03,808 --> 01:08:05,527
Thank you.

1117
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:09,984
[A standing tree position with
the help of these ladies.]

1118
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,661
Okay, that's good.

1119
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:13,556
Yes, thank you.

1120
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:17,349
That looks so difficult.
I feel bad for him.

1121
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:22,648
[Blue Team starts their search.]

1122
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:34,143
[Queen Ye Seul lets go of all her
inhibitions for the sake of victory.]

1123
01:08:36,521 --> 01:08:38,232
Ye Seul.

1124
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,848
Must you go this far?

1125
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,218
Wait a minute.

1126
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:51,175
[Even she herself can't stop laughing.]

1127
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:58,170
Your mouth needs to twist that way.

1128
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:00,274
- Eyes.
- I can't cross my eyes.

1129
01:09:00,275 --> 01:09:02,188
I really can't cross my eyes.

1130
01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:04,440
Why don't you give it a try?

1131
01:09:08,336 --> 01:09:09,757
Wait a minute.

1132
01:09:10,615 --> 01:09:15,389
Ye Seul, there's something...
No, that's not it!

1133
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:19,937
I really am a white knight, and
you need to trust me on that, okay?

1134
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:24,875
I'm going to fail this mission for you,
so you have to trust me.

1135
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:29,035
[Could Gary really be a white knight to
sacrifice winning this mission for me?]

1136
01:09:29,036 --> 01:09:32,246
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm just not a very good talker.

1137
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:35,920
- I'm not lying about it.
- You're not failing because this is too hard?

1138
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:39,621
- Why wouldn't I be able to do it?
- Then twist your lips around like this.

1139
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:42,690
I'm telling you that I can do it.

1140
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:44,978
I'll tell my team members that I can
do it and just send them away, okay?

1141
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:47,419
Show me the pose again.

1142
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:52,687
Are we done?
Do I need to go back?

1143
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,396
[Keeps it a secret from other members.]

1144
01:09:54,397 --> 01:10:00,198
[Gary asks for her trust.
Could he really be a white knight?]

1145
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:04,731
[Time to imitate the poses.]

1146
01:10:05,322 --> 01:10:08,639
[Will he get it?]

1147
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:12,388
Ye Seul actually made that pose?

1148
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,768
- Seriously?
- Ye Seul, did you do that?

1149
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:18,270
Ye Seul, that's what you did?

1150
01:10:18,271 --> 01:10:20,513
[Did Gary get the pose
purposely wrong as promised?]

1151
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:22,755
Why?

1152
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:27,041
I had it right!

1153
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:31,547
[The mouth is twisted in
the wrong direction- Fail.]

1154
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:34,980
- I can't cross my eyes.
- If Gary had only succeeded.

1155
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,852
[Had Gary succeeded, the Blue
Team would've won the mission.]

1156
01:10:37,853 --> 01:10:39,954
Wang Ji Hye should've found
Ye Seul.

1157
01:10:39,955 --> 01:10:43,826
[Ye Seul, do you trust me now?]

1158
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:50,211
[Time for the Blue Team to pose,
and the Red Team to imitate.]

1159
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,791
How am I going to do this?
I have zero flexibility!

1160
01:10:55,554 --> 01:10:58,296
[Red Team goes off on their search.]

1161
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,148
There's no one here.

1162
01:11:03,436 --> 01:11:05,438
Oh my goodness!

1163
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:09,814
[Who is that frightening monster!]

1164
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:13,773
[What monstrosity...]

1165
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:16,685
Oh my goodness!

1166
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:19,004
[A scene right out of a horror movie.]

1167
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,440
[Frightening everyone.]

1168
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,811
- What are you doing!
- You scared me!

1169
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:28,500
- What are you doing!
- Ye Seul...

1170
01:11:30,104 --> 01:11:32,867
You're grabbing onto your legs...

1171
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:35,025
and you're sticking out your tongue.

1172
01:11:35,026 --> 01:11:38,980
Ji Hye, I'm going to stay for a bit longer
to make you feel the agony some more.

1173
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,647
Do it again.
No, I'm just joking.

1174
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:43,791
I'll be back.
I have to find the others.

1175
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,550
Where's Sang Jin?

1176
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:49,371
Where is everyone?

1177
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:53,548
- He's here!
- Where's Sang Jin?

1178
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,842
[What is this pose now?]

1179
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:01,464
With the hat pulled over his head...
Is he sucking on his toe?

1180
01:12:01,465 --> 01:12:03,993
- He's sucking on his toe.
- He must've lost his mind.

1181
01:12:05,603 --> 01:12:08,494
What's wrong with him!

1182
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:12,282
[Doppelganger Gyu Woon's
upgraded pose.]

1183
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,776
Why are these people taking it so far?

1184
01:12:15,777 --> 01:12:17,850
I think I can do this.

1185
01:12:19,808 --> 01:12:22,176
[Young doppelganger starts to imitate.]

1186
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,454
There you are.

1187
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:30,176
- That's nothing.
- That's too easy.

1188
01:12:31,206 --> 01:12:33,547
- That's nothing.
- That's too easy.

1189
01:12:33,548 --> 01:12:35,529
- I'll do this one.
- Okay.

1190
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:37,330
I'll do this one.

1191
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:40,660
[Everyone rushes back to
the meeting site.]

1192
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,027
Did you get it, Kwang Soo?
You and Gyu Woon are battling it out.

1193
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,779
I vow to win this time!

1194
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:52,692
What am I going to do!

1195
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:54,840
Did you know that I play the role
of a news announcer in the drama?

1196
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,541
An extremely intelligent newscaster.

1197
01:12:57,076 --> 01:13:00,074
[Having an identity crisis.]

1198
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,729
What am I going to do?
I play a very intelligent newscaster.

1199
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,385
What if the viewers at home
get confused about my role?

1200
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,451
[Ye Seul runs into Gary again on
her way back to the meeting site.]

1201
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,086
You trust me now, right?

1202
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,535
- Yes, I really do trust you.
- I failed on purpose.

1203
01:13:14,536 --> 01:13:17,713
[Gary purposely got the pose wrong
as he promised to Ye Seul.]

1204
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:20,817
[Earning the trust of
Queen Ye Seul with a single swipe.]

1205
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,324
- Trust no one!
- You can't trust anyone in this world.

1206
01:13:23,325 --> 01:13:25,396
- Unless it's you.
- Yes.

1207
01:13:25,397 --> 01:13:28,029
[Could Gary really be a white knight?]

1208
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:32,491
- Okay, we'll get started.
- In the market, Gary can be found...

1209
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:40,488
[Gary's pose... was too easy?]

1210
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:44,334
Are you done?
In the market, Ji Suk Jin can be found...

1211
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:46,720
[Next up is Suk Jin's pose.]

1212
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:51,124
- What are you doing?
- Not easy, is it?

1213
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:53,300
[Have to bite down on the toe...]

1214
01:13:56,638 --> 01:14:00,060
- I can't reach my mouth.
- Have someone else do it.

1215
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,525
[Jae Suk bites down and succeeds!]

1216
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,320
In the market,
Jung Gyu Woon can be found...

1217
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:17,969
[Kwang Soo starts to imitate his
doppelganger, Gyu Woon- Match.]

1218
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,542
In the market,
Joo Sang Wook can be found...

1219
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,273
[A perfect match to Sang Wook's pose.]

1220
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:24,507
He was really struggling with this pose.

1221
01:14:26,401 --> 01:14:29,535
[Time to imitate Ji Hye's monstrous pose.]

1222
01:14:31,794 --> 01:14:33,837
I almost kicked her with my foot.

1223
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:39,873
[Oh? How is she doing that?]

1224
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:42,700
In the market,
Song Ji Hyo can be found...

1225
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:46,389
[Ji Hyo's pose- Match.]

1226
01:14:48,188 --> 01:14:49,948
What was Sang Jin's pose?

1227
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:54,357
- Why did he do this?
- No, can't be...

1228
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:01,951
[Unbelievable!]

1229
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:08,301
[Red Team wins the
Market Memory mission.]

1230
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:12,842
Red Team wins another game.

1231
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:14,672
Why does the other team
lose at everything?

1232
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:17,036
- With all the members they have, too.
- Seriously.

1233
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:22,082
As mentioned earlier, you can swap out
two of your teammates this time.

1234
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:24,118
[Queen Ye Seul now is given the chance
to swap out two of her teammates.]

1235
01:15:26,628 --> 01:15:30,308
[While setting up the scene
during a brief intermission.]

1236
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:34,300
- Do you have any idea?
- No, I don't.

1237
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:38,103
[Ji Hyo quietly approaches Ye Seul.]

1238
01:15:38,104 --> 01:15:42,720
[Tries to help Ye Seul
make up her decision...]

1239
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:47,195
But who do you think I should
trade out?

1240
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:53,122
[Could Ji Hyo...
also be a white knight?]

1241
01:15:53,750 --> 01:16:00,152
If the Queen will step forward, we'll let you
know how many white knights there are.

1242
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,810
- Maybe there are already four.
- I wish I could know, too.

1243
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:11,320
The current number of white knights
on the team including yourself...

1244
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:19,492
Other than yourself, there's one more.
So there are a total of two white knights.

1245
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:24,878
[A current count of two
white knights on the team.]

1246
01:16:24,879 --> 01:16:31,194
[In that case... three of
those men are black knights!]

1247
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:34,643
- I'm so confused right now.
- Tell us what he told you.

1248
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:39,298
But shouldn't she have a definite
idea of what Ha Ha is?

1249
01:16:39,299 --> 01:16:41,429
[She should be sure of Ha Ha by now
after the two exchanges he's made.]

1250
01:16:43,107 --> 01:16:45,894
[Wait...]

1251
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:50,310
I made the first swap with Ha Ha and
Jong Kook but still had the same results.

1252
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:55,209
Which means that I either swapped out
a black knight for another black knight

1253
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,065
or a white knight for
another white knight.

1254
01:16:57,066 --> 01:17:01,651
So they're the same thing, but in order to
find out whether they're friend or foe...

1255
01:17:01,652 --> 01:17:03,093
[What is their identity?]

1256
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:09,526
[That's why she put both Ha Ha
and Jong Kook back on her team.]

1257
01:17:09,527 --> 01:17:15,201
[But the number of white knights
diminished down to two.]

1258
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:21,702
[Which means...]

1259
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,239
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha...]

1260
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,385
Get out!

1261
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:29,063
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha- Get out!]

1262
01:17:29,064 --> 01:17:32,816
[Very high chance of Jong Kook
and Ha Ha being black knights.]

1263
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:39,022
Ye Seul, you have to think
very carefully about this.

1264
01:17:39,023 --> 01:17:41,132
- This is no joke.
- Shut that mouth of yours!

1265
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:43,795
- Shut that mouth of yours.
- I can do this on my own.

1266
01:17:43,796 --> 01:17:45,466
[Sense of betrayal.]

1267
01:17:46,424 --> 01:17:48,448
Fine, since we're already in this state,
want us tell you what we are?

1268
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:52,855
[Black knight duo revealing
their true identities?]

1269
01:17:52,856 --> 01:17:54,881
- Want me to tell you what I am?
- Didn't I tell you from the beginning?

1270
01:17:57,684 --> 01:18:00,037
- Do you not see what we are?
- Don't you remember what I told you?

1271
01:18:00,038 --> 01:18:03,216
- I already told you from the beginning.
- This really is something.

1272
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:05,054
Wow, unbelievable.

1273
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:07,549
You have no room to talk either!

1274
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,550
Us, too?
Why?

1275
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:13,187
[It means that either Jae Suk
or Kwang Soo is also a black knight!]

1276
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,929
Be quiet!

1277
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,655
[Queen Ye Seul is upset at the
sense of betrayal she's feeling.]

1278
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:20,073
- No, can't be.
- You've chosen your two.

1279
01:18:20,074 --> 01:18:22,759
[Only one of these two is a white knight.]

1280
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,730
[And three of these seven
are the other white knights.]

1281
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:28,801
I can bite down on all
ten of my toes.

1282
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:31,161
Why do you keep talking about
your toes?

1283
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:36,647
Gyu Woon, what are you?

1284
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:41,831
How can he not answer that when
she's looking at him with those eyes?

1285
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:44,395
- I thought she was mesmerizing him.
- Why are you trying to coerce him?

1286
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:47,748
I lost every single mission.
I haven't won a single thing yet.

1287
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,116
That's because you're
just bad at playing games.

1288
01:18:50,117 --> 01:18:52,871
It's possible that he's purposely
failing his mission.

1289
01:18:52,872 --> 01:18:53,883
[Did Gyu Woon purposely lose his missions
in order to gain Ye Seul's trust?]

1290
01:18:53,884 --> 01:18:57,369
I'm normally very good at these games.
Watch all my previous episodes on this show.

1291
01:18:57,370 --> 01:19:00,668
But I purposely failed
at all my missions today.

1292
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,515
[Game expert, Sang Wook,
purposely lost on today's missions?]

1293
01:19:02,516 --> 01:19:04,823
- Sorry, I'm a white knight.
- I think it's Ji Hyo and Sang Wook.

1294
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:10,466
- He's a white knight.
- He told me earlier that he's white.

1295
01:19:10,957 --> 01:19:14,745
[Or could Ji Hyo be a white knight,
and that's why she tried to help?]

1296
01:19:14,746 --> 01:19:17,149
[Everyone else is convinced
that she isn't...]

1297
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,122
- She definitely isn't.
- You have to know this.

1298
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:23,132
There's something that I've been doing
in secret during the whole race.

1299
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:29,883
[Did she actually get this
wrong on purpose?]

1300
01:19:29,884 --> 01:19:35,119
[And purposely chose an easy
pose for the opponents?]

1301
01:19:35,555 --> 01:19:39,279
- I really am a white knight.
- I also have a secret to share.

1302
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,859
- Look at me, Ji Hyo. I really am white.
- I'm really a white knight, too.

1303
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:45,623
I swear that I'm a white knight.

1304
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:48,948
[And Gary purposely failed at his mission to
prove to Ye Seul that he's a white knight.]

1305
01:19:49,196 --> 01:19:51,221
Okay, I've made my decision.

1306
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:55,972
- I really am a white knight.
- I could've totally ended this game.

1307
01:19:57,461 --> 01:20:00,617
[Selects Ji Hyo...]

1308
01:20:04,143 --> 01:20:08,019
[and Gary to recruit into her team.]

1309
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,049
Song Ji Hyo and Gary, please
move over to the other team.

1310
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:13,920
[Did she make the right decision?]

1311
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:16,037
That's your decision?

1312
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:19,644
The final decision has now been made.

1313
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,120
You can now head over to
the final judging platform.

1314
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,374
[Which between Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
is the black knight?]

1315
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:34,284
I'm lying with an enemy
in this car right now.

1316
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:36,242
There's a black knight amongst us.

1317
01:20:36,843 --> 01:20:41,490
We're fine as long as we win.
That team is a total mess right now.

1318
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:47,667
Gary and Ji Hyo both gave out
really easy poses.

1319
01:20:47,918 --> 01:20:49,873
Maybe Gary really is a white knight.

1320
01:20:49,874 --> 01:20:53,007
We just have to hope that
one of us in on that team.

1321
01:20:53,008 --> 01:20:55,342
- I think it's Kwang Soo.
- It is Kwang Soo.

1322
01:20:55,343 --> 01:21:00,033
Then it doesn't matter. Let's
use Gyu Woon to confuse Ye Seul.

1323
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:01,768
Good plan.

1324
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:05,094
Just blurt out that you think
I'm a black knight.

1325
01:21:05,095 --> 01:21:07,804
One serious statement from you,
and everyone will believe you.

1326
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:11,322
Sang Wook, just stay out of this.

1327
01:21:11,712 --> 01:21:14,515
[What is the truth behind
Sang Wook's mysterious identity?]

1328
01:21:15,457 --> 01:21:20,020
[Finally arrives at the final location
where all the secrets will be revealed.]

1329
01:21:20,021 --> 01:21:22,308
If you're telling me the truth,
then we'll continue to be friends

1330
01:21:22,309 --> 01:21:25,090
but if you're lying to me, then
I'm never going to see you again!

1331
01:21:27,864 --> 01:21:29,916
Tell me right now who
you're going to choose.

1332
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:32,816
Ye Seul, I think we should talk
just amongst ourselves

1333
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:33,834
and leave those two out of it.

1334
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:36,489
[The three are suddenly united as one.]

1335
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:40,937
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo are the first
ones to walk into the final location.]

1336
01:21:41,861 --> 01:21:45,195
[Could one of these two
really be a black knight?]

1337
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,109
I've made my final decision.

1338
01:21:48,565 --> 01:21:52,818
- Someone's identity is black as dirt.
- I regret the life that I've led.

1339
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:54,942
I'm sorry to everyone
for the way I've been.

1340
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:58,605
- I'm going to correct my ways.
- I can never trust this kid.

1341
01:21:58,606 --> 01:22:01,647
Please trust me!
I really am not lying right now!

1342
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:05,403
If you had been more honest in your life,
you wouldn't be the boy who cried wolf.

1343
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:14,291
[Blue Team also arrives onsite.]

1344
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:17,963
What's Wang Ji Hye's deal?
She never once said she's a white knight.

1345
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:22,975
- I really think that Ji Hye's a white knight.
- No, Ji Hye isn't a white knight.

1346
01:22:23,352 --> 01:22:26,139
Ji Suk Jin is definitely a black knight
from the way he's talking.

1347
01:22:27,983 --> 01:22:32,085
- But I'm telling you the truth.
- You should think about this again.

1348
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:35,493
- I think you've got the right team.
- Lee Kwang Soo is black.

1349
01:22:35,494 --> 01:22:37,253
No, Jae Suk is a black knight.

1350
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:42,539
Welcome to Black Knight Race's
final mission.

1351
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:50,029
The Queen of White Knights must gather up
all the information she's been given thus far

1352
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:53,479
and use the one final chance
she'll be given to make her trade.

1353
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,066
Thank you.

1354
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:59,028
If all the members on your team end up
being white knights, then you win the race.

1355
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:03,985
But if even one black knight is on the team,
then the other team wins the race.

1356
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:10,217
If the Black Knight Team wins, then
the balloon above your heads will pop open.

1357
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:14,099
[Giant flour filled balloons!]

1358
01:23:14,926 --> 01:23:17,606
We win the race if one of our
black knights is on her team, right?

1359
01:23:17,607 --> 01:23:19,580
Then what happens to that black
knight with all that flour?

1360
01:23:19,581 --> 01:23:21,207
They'll get doused as well.

1361
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,622
It's just part of the mission.

1362
01:23:25,003 --> 01:23:30,857
Point to the member on your team that
you'd like to kick off the team.

1363
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:34,113
[Time to choose the member
whom she wants to trade out.]

1364
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:38,963
Ye Seul has that look in her eyes.

1365
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:41,301
- One of us is a black knight.
- I know.

1366
01:23:41,302 --> 01:23:45,266
- It's him.
- I'm not going to say anymore.

1367
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:47,466
- I'll accept whatever decision you make.
- Don't be swayed.

1368
01:23:48,242 --> 01:23:51,830
- Don't hesitate on your decision.
- Go with the one whom you already chose.

1369
01:23:51,831 --> 01:23:54,142
Okay, I'm going to announce my decision.

1370
01:23:54,143 --> 01:23:55,957
I'm going to announce my decision.

1371
01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:02,324
[Just which of the two is a black knight?]

1372
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:07,518
Yoo Jae Suk, get out!

1373
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:10,628
There was nothing else we could do.

1374
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:14,273
[Swaps out Yoo Jae Suk.]

1375
01:24:14,274 --> 01:24:17,001
- It has to be Kwang Soo.
- How frustrating.

1376
01:24:17,002 --> 01:24:19,864
- I'm so sure that it's Kwang Soo.
- You have to make the right selection.

1377
01:24:19,865 --> 01:24:21,288
[I don't know what to do either!]

1378
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:25,917
[Instead of hardworking Jae Suk,
Ye Seul chooses traitorous Kwang Soo.]

1379
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:29,126
- Seriously?
- Why?

1380
01:24:29,127 --> 01:24:33,534
You must recruit one member
to fill up your now empty spot.

1381
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,226
[Must recruit one opposing member
to fill in Jae Suk's now empty space.]

1382
01:24:36,444 --> 01:24:39,544
- I think I'll bring Ha Ha back in...
- That can't be an easy decision to make.

1383
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:48,248
[Verified that Ha Ha and Jong Kook are
black knights with the first two swaps made.]

1384
01:24:52,876 --> 01:24:56,806
[That's why I'm sure that
it's not you two.]

1385
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:02,915
[And the two hard to identify members...]

1386
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:06,486
[Sang Wook and Sang Jin.]

1387
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:15,523
[Sang Wook strongly offered himself up
during every trading session.]

1388
01:25:19,218 --> 01:25:21,282
<i>I really am a white knight.</i>

1389
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,875
<i>You frighten me the most.</i>

1390
01:25:26,478 --> 01:25:29,490
<i>I've been a white knight from
the start. I'm a white knight.</i>

1391
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:31,651
<i>I'm telling you that I'm the one!</i>

1392
01:25:31,652 --> 01:25:36,478
[Sang Jin even looked desperate.]

1393
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:44,188
[It's decision time.]

1394
01:25:44,816 --> 01:25:49,283
Sang Jin, come here!

1395
01:25:50,731 --> 01:25:54,269
[Han Sang Jin is recruited in.]

1396
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,921
That's just absurd!

1397
01:25:56,922 --> 01:26:00,739
- Are you serious?
- I thought Sang Jin was for sure black.

1398
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:03,426
Kwang Soo should've been
swapped out for me.

1399
01:26:03,427 --> 01:26:05,939
I really hope that he's a white knight.

1400
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,625
[Did Ye Seul make the smart choice?]

1401
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:10,651
- It's all over now.
- The dice has been thrown.

1402
01:26:10,652 --> 01:26:12,712
[Time to verify the answer.]

1403
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:14,624
[Checking Ye Seul's monitor.]

1404
01:26:16,516 --> 01:26:18,314
The Queen of White Knights.

1405
01:26:18,315 --> 01:26:22,458
[Sign of the white knight for being
the Queen of White Knights.]

1406
01:26:22,459 --> 01:26:24,918
Okay, next.
One, two, three!

1407
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:26,245
[Next up- Gary.]

1408
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,777
[Ye Seul felt sure of Gary and
recruited him after the last round.]

1409
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:41,919
[Gary is a white knight.]

1410
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:49,994
- Just wait to see hers.
- Okay, Ji Hyo.

1411
01:26:49,995 --> 01:26:51,520
[Ji Hyo's turn.]

1412
01:26:52,237 --> 01:26:56,410
[Ji Hyo showed her trust in Ye Seul
and leaned on her throughout the day.]

1413
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,497
[Ji Hyo- White Knight.]

1414
01:27:04,256 --> 01:27:07,614
[Proceeding as predicted so far.]

1415
01:27:11,178 --> 01:27:13,348
Kwang Soo is next.

1416
01:27:13,349 --> 01:27:15,445
This is the highlight of the day.

1417
01:27:15,446 --> 01:27:19,261
Please stand directly below
your balloons.

1418
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,065
- It's Kwang Soo, isn't it?
- Kwang Soo?

1419
01:27:22,486 --> 01:27:26,103
- It was between Kwang Soo and I.
- Let's see this.

1420
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:35,713
[Could Kwang Soo be a white knight?]

1421
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:46,662
[Lee Kwang Soo- White Knight.]

1422
01:27:46,996 --> 01:27:50,040
- You're a black knight?
- Yes, I am.

1423
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:52,531
- I had no idea.
- Jae Suk is a black knight!

1424
01:27:52,532 --> 01:27:55,508
[Jae Suk had everyone fooled.]

1425
01:27:55,509 --> 01:27:57,755
- I told you that I'm a white knight.
- I had no idea.

1426
01:28:05,082 --> 01:28:07,632
- It's still up in the air right now.
- Sang Jin is the last to go!

1427
01:28:07,633 --> 01:28:11,361
[Time to verify Sang Jin's identity.]

1428
01:28:11,362 --> 01:28:13,324
One, two... this is the final one.

1429
01:28:13,325 --> 01:28:16,598
[White Knights vs Black Knights.]

1430
01:28:19,074 --> 01:28:23,490
[If Sang Jin turns out to be a white knight,
then Team White Knights wins.]

1431
01:28:24,344 --> 01:28:28,350
[If Sang Jin turns out to be a black knight,
then victory goes to Black Knights.]

1432
01:28:29,532 --> 01:28:41,276
[Just what is Sang Jin's true identity?]

1433
01:28:54,718 --> 01:29:02,266
[Team White Knights wins!]

1434
01:29:06,831 --> 01:29:10,150
[Sang Jin has been
a white knight all along.]

1435
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:18,136
[Ye Seul's completely miraculous win.]

1436
01:29:21,073 --> 01:29:22,809
He had me completely fooled.

1437
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:24,598
[Black knights are still
left feeling befuddled.]

1438
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:27,998
Why?
What did I ever say?

1439
01:29:27,999 --> 01:29:30,853
[Starting to turn the blame
on each other.]

1440
01:29:30,854 --> 01:29:32,869
- You said you were white at first.
- That was just a joke.

1441
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,131
Team White Knights wins!

1442
01:29:35,132 --> 01:29:38,633
[White Knights win the race.]

1443
01:29:38,634 --> 01:29:41,461
Did you never once think that
I could be a white knight?

1444
01:29:41,462 --> 01:29:44,331
- Of course, I have.
- See? I knew it.

1445
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:49,494
- He really is a piece of work.
- I should've tried harder.

1446
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,108
You really can't go
about your life alone.

1447
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:58,728
- Ye Seul, you know what it is?
- She learned a new lesson.

1448
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:04,308
- Can you say it just once?
- I'm never running away again.

1449
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:06,485
I'm never running away again.

1450
01:30:07,033 --> 01:30:09,446
[Ye Seul will always remain here with us.]

1451
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:13,070
[Birth of a Beauty- Joo Sang Wook, Ye Seul,
Gyu Woon, Wang Ji Hye, and Han Sang Jin.]
