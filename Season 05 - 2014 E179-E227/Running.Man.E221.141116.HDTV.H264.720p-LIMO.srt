the mouth of Seomjingang River.]

[Jeollanam-do Province's
Gokseong-eup Daepyeong-ri.]

00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,713
- Hello.
- You've come a long way.

5
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:31,005
Yes, I've been wanting to come
visit Jiri Mountain for a long time.

6
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,714
Wow, look at all the beautiful
fall leaves.

7
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:39,155
What's going on here?
Are we the only ones here?

8
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:43,104
What is this? You can't team up two
of the weakest members together.

9
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:44,912
This place is really nice.
Where is this place?

10
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:49,183
Look at the beautiful mountain.
That's not Jiri Mountain, is it?

11
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:51,071
- It's Jiri Mountain?
- It's Jiri Mountain?

12
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:56,103
So the car brought us to
Jiri Mountain?

13
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:00,291
What are we doing here?
We're at Jiri Mountain.

14
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,301
- What are we doing here?
- Take a look behind you.

15
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,417
- Look behind us?
- It's a senior citizen center!

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,342
- Isn't that a senior citizen center?
- Why are we at a senior citizen center?

17
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:12,413
Me?

18
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,626
I think I'm supposed to go into
the barbershop.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,062
What's going on here?

20

[Blank Ji arrives at a gas station.]

21

With the arrival of all the members
at Jiri Mountain for a visit

23

we will now commence the
2014 Running Man Event Race.

24
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,893
We came all the way to Jiri Mountain
to do an event?

25
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:42,642
For the first event, the owner of this
gas station himself sent out the invitation.

26
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:44,049
[Blank Ji's first event is at the
invitation of the gas station owner.]

27

- I'm the Village Head.
- Hello, Sir.

28
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,514

[A grand bow greeting
to the village head.]

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,084
You have to give me a heads up
before you do that.

31
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,579
Market's 40th anniversary?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,317

by the market owner.]

33

Jae Suk!

34
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,926
It's so nice to meet you!

35
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:12,044
- It's really nice to meet you.
- Hello.

36
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,976
[A warm greeting from all the neighbors.]

37
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:17,410
- Is today the market's 40th anniversary?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:21,554
Even though it's been more than 40 years,
we're just going to say that it's our 40th.

39
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:24,204
- What did you write on your hand?
- 40th anniversary.

40
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,121
[A cheat note to remind herself
that it's the 40th anniversary.]

41
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:31,129
- Take good care of it for us, Jae Suk.
- Do not worry, Ma'am.

42
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,810
Leave it to me,
and I will take great care to

43
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:39,334
ensure your 40th anniversary event
goes perfectly without any glitches.

44
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,008
Yes, okay.

45

[Gary has been summoned by
the owner of the barbershop.]

47
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,511
I've been operating my barbershop
for over 30 years now.

48
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:53,439
- Really?
- I need your help getting more customers.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,143
Should I stand out here and do this?

50
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:59,262
Ah, you want me to promote
your gas station?

51
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,205
This place is famous for the dogwood fruit?

52

[Big-nose and Ha Ha to help promote

[However...]

55
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,537
I'm supposed to stand here
by myself...

56
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,135
and promote this gas station?

57
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,763
I want all the staff members to
fill up their gas tanks right now.

58
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,653
- Hello, Ji Hyo.
- Oh my goodness!

59
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:38,945
Oh my goodness!

[The golden idol boys, Super Junior,
are here at Jiri Mountain gas station.]

63
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,936
I can't believe this! Are you
guys going to be doing this with me?

64
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,809
- We came here to help you.
- Really?

65
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,321
- Can you pretend you're happy to see me too?
- Kyu Hyun! So glad to see you!

66
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:12,077
- Wow, I can't believe this.
- Let's go over here.

67
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,791
[But what's on the wheelbarrow?]

68
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:17,623
[A must for any event-
A karaoke machine.]

69
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:23,632

barbershop helper?]

71

[The top soul musicians to help out
at the barbershop event.]

76
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,465
I think this is a karaoke machine...

77
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,506
- Wait a minute.
- Did you not get any sleep last night?

78
00:04:56,293 --> 00:05:00,091
What's this karaoke machine for?
We're going to promote by singing?

79
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:04,069
But... Bobby doesn't really know
any Korean songs.

80
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:07,063
- I know a few.
- He only knows pop music.

81
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:09,033
Am I not allowed to sing
pop music?

82
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:12,618
- Wow, dogwood fruit extracts.
- You and I both need it.

83
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,392
Is anyone here?

84
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,382
- Excuse me!
- Is someone headed this way?

We're all set now.

94
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,613
- Today's the day! We're going to win.
- Why did they team me up with you two?

95
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,965
Our ages combined is way over
a hundred years old.

96
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,639
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Let's come up with a name for our team.

97
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,797
- How about 'Yittagu'?
- Okay, let's go with that.

98
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:05,107
Yittagu... we are Yittagu.
(Meaning, 'We are here.')

99
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:09,715
- It's be a new sating of sorts.
- We are still Yittagu... (We still got it.)

100

- We are Yittagu.
- Dogwood fruit is Yittagu.

102
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,459
Push harder.
It's suddenly getting very heavy.

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,155
- Is it getting heavy?
- There you are!

- Yes, he is.

116
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,773
- Do you know what Kim Kyung Ho sings?
- I don't know any of his songs.

117
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,534
I'd be more surprised if you knew
my songs.

118
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:16,920
Ma'am I'm going to do the promotional event
with Kim Kyung Ho and Kim Yeon Woo

To celebrate the market's
40th anniversary

122
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,566
you just need to accept the villagers'
requests and sing songs for them.

123
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,519
That shouldn't be a problem
with these two singers here.

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,640
But we will only accept the songs
if you score 70 points or above.

125
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,910
Seventy points.

126
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,835
You have to sing for ten people.

127
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:47,231
[Must sing a total of ten requested songs
in order to succeed the mission.]

128
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:51,249
But if the songs are being requested by
elders, we may not know a lot of the songs

129
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,488
so what do we do then?

130
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,929
There may be a lot of songs
that we may not be familiar with.

131
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,459
[This team is worried about
the same issue.]

[Must sing the songs that are
requested by the villagers.]

133
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:08,373

- Bobby's here to promote his new album.

that will be requested of them to sing...]

doesn't seem to be worried...]

[The star of that voice is...]

137
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,129

140
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,875
I can't do things like this,
but Jin Young's so good at it!

141
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:47,284
- I wish I could learn from her.
- We totally lucked out.

142

for this event!

00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,948
[What an odd girl...]

149
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:12,850
- Ma'am, we wish you great health!
- Happy new lunar year!

150
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,342
Let's just keep going.

151

[The event goddess leans back
in a relaxed pose on the dolly.]

154

Who else but Hong Jin Young
would do something like this?

155
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,152
You're a tad bit embarrassed, aren't you?

156
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:38,978
- Maybe we should turn down the volume.
- Let's turn it down a little bit.

157
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:44,741
Hong-Kook-Soo is here.
We're here to sing our songs for you.

158
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,506
Put some muscle into it!

[The event singers are ready... but
there aren't any audiences to be found.]

['What's wrong with my age.'
is the title of the song!]

182

and no regards to the rhythm.]

190
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,405
- Is that right?

We're really sorry, but we
don't know who Jin Sung is.

- This song is really popular lately.
- This song is?

Sis... I can't believe I
called her 'Sis'.

[Kyung Ho remains oblivious to their
opinion, and just keeps on singing.]

281

00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,906
Thank you for all your hard work.

477
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:37,342
[Village head comes to thank them
for a job well done.]

478
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,102
- Thank you so much.
- You have your next event to get to.

479
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,512
- Who should I give this to?
- I can take that.

480
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:45,252
- No, I'll take it.
- You can give it to any one of us.

481
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:48,403
- Please give it to me.
- Just give it to him.

482
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:51,746
- I like being given things.
- I bet we have a good one.

483
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:53,913
[What is their second event mission?]

484
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,323
A campaign celebration.

485
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:58,057
This is where we go for our
second mission?

486
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:01,555
[Next mission is an old custom
campaign celebration event.]

487
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:04,917
You must find your own way
to the next event location.

488
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:07,243
The faster we get there,
better advantage we'll have.

489
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:09,772
- How are we going to get there?
- Since we made money, let's take a taxi.

490
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:15,057
- Sir, is this place far?
- It'll take you about 30 minutes.

491
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:18,179
- Sorry to ask, but are you busy right now?
- No, not really.

492
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,327
- Then can you give us a ride?
- But I only have a truck.

493
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:24,939
- No, it's okay!
- Is that okay with you guys?

494
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,583
[They luck out! Village head
is actually headed that way.]

495
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:31,076
Put that money away. He's helping us
out of the goodness of his heart.

496
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:34,208
[Now the question is,
who'll be the first to get there?]

497
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,930
[Yeon Woo is still belting out the tunes
for their team's final song.]

498
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:45,168
[Their last audience member
is an adorable baby.]

499
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:54,857
[The baby quietly listens to the song
within the comfort of his mother's arms.]

500
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,939
How is he so calm and attentive?

501
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,186
[He's a pretty good singer.]

502
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:29,462
[Yeon Woo sings more earnestly now
than he ever has before.]

503
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,774
[Explosion of adlibbing.]

504
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:50,471
[An amazing singer who always gives
his all no matter how small the stage.]

505
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:54,456
We don't know when we'd be back,
but please always remain healthy.

506
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:58,469
[To everyone who joined us today,
wishing you all a lifetime of joy and health.]

507
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:05,944
[A beautiful and heartwarming
performance.]

508
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,676
- That was great.
- I can't believe how sweet this baby is!

509
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:15,260
- He didn't even get scared at all.

- Yes, we loved it.

511
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,929
- This is Seo Yeon.
- His name is Seo Yeon?

512
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,694
- This is my grandson.
- He's your grandson?

513
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,218
No, she's your granddaughter.

514
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,228
She's actually his granddaughter,
but he called her his 'grandson.'

515
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:29,414
[Mistakes his own granddaughter
as his grandson.]

516
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:32,696
How sweet are you!
You are such a sweet baby.

517
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:34,812

strong, Seo Yeon.]

their second mission site.]

520

[Advantages will be given out to the teams
depending on the order of their arrival.]

521
00:38:46,632 --> 00:38:49,093
We can't start getting tired
after the opening game we just had.

522
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:52,504
- My back is starting to ache already.
- No, that's not allowed.

523
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:55,016
Bobby, have you ever been to
Jiri Mountain before?

524
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,623
- Jiri Mountain?
- Yes.

525
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,919
- Yes, I've been here before.
- You've been to Jiri Mountain before?

526
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,911
To see the gam-poongi.
(A word slip on Dam-poonghi= Autumn leaves.]

527
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:03,550
- Gam-poongi?
- I mean, dam-poongi.

528
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:09,017
Bobby, what's wrong with you!
You can't even speak Korean or English.

529
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,716
[Not good with either Korean
or the English language.]

530
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:14,005
- Jung In got married in Jiri Mountain.
- Seriously?

531
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:16,013
[Jiri Mountain has a very special
meaning for Jung In.]

532
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:19,270
[Instead of a wedding ceremony, Jung In and
Jung Chi started their marriage with a hike.]

533
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:24,345
[Wanting to do something meaningful,
they took a picture at the mountain summit.]

534
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,817
So you started your lives together
as a married couple in Jiri Mountain.

535
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:30,117
- Yes, that's right.
- Life as a married couple.

536
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:45,014
[Old Customs Campaign Celebrations.]

537
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,501
Thank you.
Have a great day.

[Team Sum-Jin-Kang is the
first to arrive.]

539
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,925
Hello.

540
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:02,355
[On the beautiful outskirts of Jiri Mountain,
a field of ripe persimmon trees.]

541
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:05,947
[What kind of an event awaits
our teams here?]

542
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,243
Are we going to roll around here?

543
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:11,646
[You'll soon find out.]

544
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,576
[Team Gae-Jung-Bi arrives in second place.]

545
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:18,449
- Look who's here!
- It's an honor see my seniors here.

546
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:23,676
[A happy greeting between
the musician juniors and seniors.]

547
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:25,898
- Bobby!
- He's getting married.

548
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:29,166
- He's getting married this Saturday.
- This upcoming Saturday?

549
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,022
[I'm getting married!]

550
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:34,376
Kyung Ho's getting married
this weekend.

551
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:38,825
[Married on November 9th.
A married rocker from this point on.]

552
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:41,244
Then you're going to have to
be careful today.

553
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,008
- Who is Kwang Soo with?
- It's Hong Jin Young.

554
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:46,355
And Kim Jong Kook?
Jin Young!

[Team Hong-Kook-Soo arrives in third place.]

556
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,965
[Jin Young makes her moves
the moment she arrives.]

557
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:55,505
Did you all know that Bobby was the
rapper for our song, 'The Twist King'?

558
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:58,807
- Seriously?
- Yes, for the rapping portion of it.

559
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:01,251
- Bobby was the rapper for that.
- Seriously?

560
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,423
- Back then, Bobby...
- 'Come on people, on your feet!'

561
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:05,752
[That's the voice!]

562
00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:08,753
[An instant replay even after
all these years have passed.]

563
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:13,073
[Team Yittagu arrives in fourth place.]

564
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:17,528
[Welcome!]

565
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,305
[The country's top singers are finally
gathered together in one place.]

566
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:25,311
- What's this all about?
- Today's race is 'Running Man Event Race'.

567
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:30,866
To the winning team of each of these
missions for the race here at Jiri Mountain

568
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:34,854
a hint will be given out in the order of
their win regarding the final mission.

569
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,511
[Team Sun-Jin-Kang arrived in first place.]

570
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,690
[First place clue- Agricultural product
that is cultivated on our own soil.]

571
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,310
[Team Gae-Jung-Bi arrived
in second place.]

572
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:50,195

575
00:41:55,644 --> 00:42:00,706
The winning team will get to stand on stage
at the upcoming Jiri Mountain concert event.

576
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:05,305
A simple mission to help determine which
one of the teams will stand on that stage.

577
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:08,662
- We have to win this no matter what.
- Here's your second event mission.

578
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:12,448
Your second mission is, 'Our old
custom is better' campaign celebration.

579
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,392
- Ours is better.
- Is that right?

580
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:22,162
Then this mission is a
battle of the moles.

581
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:26,021
One member from each team will step
forward to compete against one another.

582
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:29,245
Do you see the wooden blocks
in front of the start line?

583
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:34,788
You have to dig a tunnel in the dirt
to pass through under the wooden blocks.

584
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:37,514
- Are you serious?
- Then...

585
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:39,606
- That's just absurd.
- That's crazy.

586
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:45,322
[We told you that it's a 'mole' game.]

587
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:48,730
- You expect us to dig in the dirt?
- Past that, you'll find some shovels.

588
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:54,331
Step on the shovel to fling the rubber shoe
in the air and catch it in your basket.

589
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:59,935
Then run and pull the radish out of the dirt
to lift it above your head to win the game.

590
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:02,679
- Yes, one person will do it all.
- How can one person do it alone?

591
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,914
The more you win, the better
clues you'll be able to earn.

592
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:10,036
- It's crucial that you pick the right person.
- Narsha is our ace.

593
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:17,026

I can handle these opponents!]

after seeing who their opponents are.]

597
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:35,884
- I can do this.
- This isn't bad.

598
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:38,863
[Who'll be the last one laughing?]

599
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:42,887
[Mole game- Round one.]

600
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,481
- Yeon Woo!
- Team Yittagu!

601
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,802

brimming with confidence.]

- Team Yittagu!
- Fighting!

603
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,067
[And an even more fervent cheering section.]

- Jiri Mountain!
- Jiri Mountain!

605
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:06,123
- Yeon Woo, you can do this!

606
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:08,878
- Yes, Dam-poongi, fighting!
- Dam-poongi!

607
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,471
[Looking at ease as if standing in
the fruit garden of his own home.]

608
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:15,363
Don't you think that Yeon Woo's
pants are hiked up too high?

609
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,921
- He can't help it.
- He looks good from the side.

610
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:21,956
[The perfect size to dig his way
through the dirt hole.]

611
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,135
He's a human mole!

612
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:32,522
- How is he such a good digger?
- I'm not kidding when I say they're a mess.

613
00:44:32,523 --> 00:44:35,080
- You guys are a hot mess!
- You really are a hot mess.

614
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:39,786
Teuk only looks young here because of us,
but he's actually ancient in the idol world.

615
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:41,835
Everyone, get ready!

616
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:45,338
[Mole game- Round one.]

617
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,966
[A dead sprint towards their first obstacle.]

618
00:44:50,794 --> 00:44:53,430
You have to dig really fast.

619
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,632
[Some serious digging in the dirt.]

620
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:57,748
- Kim Bobby!
- You're too slow!

621
00:44:57,749 --> 00:44:59,648

- Teuk is really fast.
- Wow, Teuk is no joke.

625
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:12,591
[I wonder if this will be enough.]

626
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,813
- Yeon Woo, dig in front of you!
- You're too slow!

627
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:25,105
Kwang Soo, get out from under there!

628
00:45:27,548 --> 00:45:29,198
We've already lost this game.

629
00:45:30,136 --> 00:45:32,845
[Already done digging deep enough
to squeeze his head through.]

630
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,968
[Fighting, Teuk!]

631
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:43,442
[Yeon Woo also succeeds in
sticking his head through.]

632
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,298
Yeon Woo, you're getting through.

633
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:48,298
[Teuk also succeeds in getting
his shoulders through the hole.]

634
00:45:54,979 --> 00:45:57,917
[Time to start cheating.]

635
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:01,720
Kwang Soo!
Bobby's getting through!

636
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:06,056
- Bobby's getting through!
- Bobby, not yet!

637
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,223
Don't do it, Bobby!

638
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,954
- Kwang Soo!
- Suk Jin, over there!

639
00:46:11,288 --> 00:46:15,002
- Suk Jin!
- My shoulders are stuck.

640
00:46:15,003 --> 00:46:18,915
I'm older than you...
I'm older than you!

641
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:22,257
[Yeon Woo's almost through
the opening.]

642
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,767
- Yeon Woo's almost through.
- Bobby!

643
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:28,864
[I'm more frustrated than you are!]

644
00:46:30,808 --> 00:46:36,265
[Just then... Teuk makes his escape!]

645
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:40,514
[Teuk is first to make his way
to the second course.]

646
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,026
Hurry, Yeon Woo!

647
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,450
[Yeon Woo makes his escape
soon thereafter.]

648
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:47,436
Yeon Woo, you have to hurry!

649
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,434
He won't get it on his first try.

650
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,886
[Barely manages to escape, and it's
one hurdle after another.]

651
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,067
[Yeon Woo succeeds on his first try!]

652
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:06,926
[How did he get so lucky?]

653
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,779
What luck is this?

654
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,008
[Leeteuk is hot on Yeon Woo's tail.]

655
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:17,860
[Teuk is hot on his trail...
but the radish isn't so easy to pull.]

656
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,176
[The real physical battle begins.]

657
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:32,834
[Kwang Soo successfully makes his escape.]

658
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:37,270
Put the basket on your head.

659
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:44,900
Are you out of your mind?

660
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:49,308
[Big-nose also makes his escape
soon after Kwang Soo.]

661
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:52,495
Move it, Mister!

662
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,031
[Almost depleted of energy after
the hole he had had to crawl through.]

663
00:47:55,032 --> 00:47:57,094
Hey, Kim Bobby!

664
00:47:57,095 --> 00:47:58,389
[Meanwhile...]

665
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,022
[This one man is still sharing
some quality time with the dirt.]

666
00:48:03,288 --> 00:48:04,921
Bobby!

667
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:08,923
[How did everyone else do this?]

668
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:13,564
[Still digging a hole all by himself.]

669
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:18,491
[It's now a battle against himself.]

670
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:31,281
[Kwang Soo rushes over for the radish.]

671
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:37,942
[Suk Jin also succeeds soon thereafter.]

672
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:39,951
Run!

673
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:47,083
[The radish still shows no intention
of going anywhere...]

674
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,530
[And there's still Bobby...]

675
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,612
[Finally succeeds in making his escape.]

676
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:57,082
Okay!

677
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:04,386
[It's a battle against himself anyway.]

678
00:49:04,387 --> 00:49:05,967
Do it right!

679
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:09,274
[Bobby's hilarious!]

680
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:13,579
Don't give up, Bobby!

681
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:20,163
- Bobby, don't give up.
- Narsha, are you okay?

682
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:24,682
- Bobby, you're almost there.
- Narsha can't stop laughing.

683
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:29,524
[This eager fan is happier for him
than his own teammates are.]

684
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:32,071
Narsha is now a huge fan of Bobby's.

685
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:33,911
What are they doing over there?

686
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:42,066
[Frustrated onlookers at the lack of
progress their partners are making.]

687
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,945
[Bursts out laughing whenever
she sees Bobby.]

688
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:51,316
They're all prominent figures
of this country on their own...

689
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:55,272
[But this radish is all we see right now...]

690
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:05,408
[A fiery battle begins as soon as
the radish gets pulled out of the ground.]

691
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,870
It's like they're playing rugby.

692
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,279
[The battle of the radish
starts to get very fierce.]

693
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,812
- You have to lift it above your head!
- Don't give up, Suk Jin!

694
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:23,052
Yeon Woo, eye for your chance!

695
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:26,565
- Suk Jin already gave up a long time ago.
- It's like a game of rugby.

696
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:33,676
[Succeeds at nabbing the radish after
having stayed with the radish all along.]

697
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:37,970
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang wins the first round.]

698
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:42,428
[His follow-plan succeeds.]

699
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:50,640
Narsha is a fan of Bobby's.

700
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:52,506
[An enthused fan cracks up
at Bobby's every move.]

701
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:57,955
[Even though he lost his radish,
he gains himself a new fan.]

702
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:00,740
She laughs at everything he does.

703
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:06,328
[As part of his fan service,
offer his fan a hug.]

704
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:11,651
Not a single person here
respects me right now.

705
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:13,644
Marsha here at least...

706
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:17,420
[Who's Marsha?]

707
00:51:20,986 --> 00:51:22,840
[Thanks, Narsha.]

708
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:23,942
He's so cute.

709
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:26,701
Okay, time for the final contestants.

710
00:51:26,702 --> 00:51:30,397
[Team Hong-Kook-Soo wins the second round,
and it's now time for the final round.]

711
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:32,713
On the count of three,
final contestants, step forward.

712
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:40,111
[Jung In, Jin Young, Ji Hyo,
Kyung Ho, Ha Ha.]

713
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,352
It's all women.

714
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,473
You're all women, okay?

715
00:51:46,474 --> 00:51:49,000
It's like a girl group
with the exception of you.

716
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:51,203
[With Ha Ha out, it's like
a four member girl group.]

717
00:51:51,204 --> 00:51:53,272
Look from the back.
It's a total girl group.

718
00:51:53,273 --> 00:51:55,219
[Very deceptive from the back.]

719
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,809
All the contestants move over
to the starting line.

720
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,304
[Final round of the mole game.]

721
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:04,136
[A fierce battle between the women
is estimated.]

722
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:07,746
- Kyung Ho, you can't go easy on them.
- I'm ready to be decimated!

723
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:11,148
Kyung Ho, if you lose,
I'm not going to like you anymore!

724
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,732
I'll do my best!

725
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:17,495
You just wait!
I'll bring back the radish!

726
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,791
Jin Young loves doing things like that.

727
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:26,044
[Jin Young's never-ending charm.]

728
00:52:26,045 --> 00:52:29,054
Jung In, you should give it a try, too.

729
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,864
- Show us what you've got.
- You do it too, Jung In.

730
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:35,473
Radish, you're mine!

731
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:37,779
Enough!
That's enough!

732
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,667
Kyung Ho!
You give it a try.

733
00:52:41,668 --> 00:52:43,568
- What do I say?
- Say, 'Radish, you're mine.'

734
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:47,584
Radish, you're mine!

735
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:51,113
[That was good!]

736
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:54,353
- His was the best!
- That was so cute!

737
00:52:54,354 --> 00:52:57,277
Third round contestants, get ready!

738
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:59,242
[Current score- Team Sum-Jin-Kang:1
vs Team Hong-Kook-Soo:1.]

739
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,812
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

740
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:04,195
[This round could determine
who'll win first place.]

741
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:12,865
Kyung Ho, what are you doing?

742
00:53:13,846 --> 00:53:16,222
[First obstacle-
Dig a hole and crawl through the dirt.]

743
00:53:16,515 --> 00:53:21,748
[As if they've been studying, they
start their own method of dirt digging.]

744
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:25,058
You have to dig up front, too.
There you go.

745
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:28,371
- You have to dig front and back.
- Kyung Ho.

746
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,521
[Kyung Ho calmly digs front and back.]

747
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,981
A little bit more.

748
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,284
[Kyung Ho attempts to make his escape.]

749
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,617
Kyung Ho, you can't make it through yet.

750
00:53:47,051 --> 00:53:49,951
[Extremely slim body! Crawls his
way through the tiny opening!]

751
00:53:54,605 --> 00:53:58,511
[I can't let you get through that fast.]

752
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:03,971
[If I can just grab his feet...]

753
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:08,458
[Kyung Ho makes his escape
at top speed.]

754
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,341
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang
is one step closer to a win.]

755
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:17,037
[Our Ace Blank Ji escapes
hot on Kyung Ho's heels.]

756
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:21,650
- You have to do it again.
- Song Ji Hyo!

757
00:54:21,651 --> 00:54:24,115
[Ace blazes her trail.]

758
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,723
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo, fighting!

759
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:28,705
Song Ji Hyo!

760
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:40,767
[Even succeeds at catching
the rubber shoe on his second attempt.]

761
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,713
Just start digging around the radish first!

762
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,101
[At a speed we've yet been
able to see.]

763
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:50,041
[Will he be able to end the
game right here?]

764
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,500
[No!]

765
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,915
[Pulls the radish out of the dirt!]

766
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:05,760
[Put everything back in the basket
and lifts it above his head!]

767
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:09,453
[Kyung Ho's amazing performance lands
Team Sum-Jin-Kang in first place.]

768
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,869
- We won!
- Already?

769
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:15,237
[Even all the losing teams are
flabbergasted at Kyung Ho's win.]

770
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:20,526
[Everyone's shocked at
the groom-to-be's performance.]

771
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:23,249
[I got dirt in my eye.]

772
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,861
- Jung In, you were too slow.
- What are they doing?

773
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:29,923
What was that?
What are you doing?

774
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:32,183
[No, it was nothing...]

775
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:34,585
- What are you two doing?
- Is it a new romance?

776
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:37,398
- Kim Jong Kook!
- She said she got dirt in her eye.

777
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:40,363
I'm asking because I'm curious

778
00:55:40,364 --> 00:55:43,079
but do you start kissing on these shows
now if you're attracted to someone?

779
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,079
- Is that what you do now?
- Knock it off.

780
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:47,526
- Nice going!
- It's been awhile since I've done this.

781
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,276
Jong Kook, you've got something
in your eye.

782
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:52,115
- There's nothing!
- You've got something in your eye!

783
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:55,690
[First place: Team Sum-Jin-Kang.
Second Place: Team Hong-Kook-Soo.]

784
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:01,250
[Team Super Blank Ji wins
the tiebreaker round.]

785
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:08,388
[Come visit Jiri Mountain's orchard grove.]

786
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:10,437
But you were still funny.

787
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:11,642
[Second place winners:
Team Hong-Kook-Soo.]

788
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:14,493
[While you're in Jiri Mountain, you
have to try these foods before you go.]

789
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,431
I have no idea what the
previous clue meant.

790
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:19,138
[First place winner:
Team Sum-Jin-Kang.]

791
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:23,067
[Like the charm of a peacock!
Both the green and the red are delicious.]

792
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:25,159
I don't know what that means either.

793
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,820
[Distribution of clues are now complete.]

794
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:30,751
[What is the secret hidden
behind these clues?]

795
00:56:31,784 --> 00:56:33,924
Do you have a mudpack
on your face?

796
00:56:34,668 --> 00:56:37,583
Your skin tone looks much better now.

797
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:42,333
[The benefits of organic soil.]

798
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:45,583
- Your skin tone against the shirt...
- He finally looks like a live human being.

799
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:53,146
Teuk seems to find everything funny because
he hasn't been on a variety show in so long.

800
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:55,349
He's so intrigued and amused
by everything.

801
00:56:56,303 --> 00:56:58,771
I find it fascinating because
I feel like I'm amongst celebrities.

802
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:00,854
It's really fascinating.

803
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:04,604
Kyu Hyun, who do you keep looking
at Teuk with such look of disdain?

804
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:06,365
I just want to take off these pants.

805
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:09,300
- He has his own reasons.
- No kidding.

806
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:13,376
Kyu Hyun's not like he used to be
from having been around Goo Ra.

807
00:57:13,377 --> 00:57:15,858
He keeps looking disgruntled.

808
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:21,144
[Off to the next event mission site.]

809
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:25,667
<i>[As long as you're in Jiri Mountain,
try these foods before you go.]</i>

810
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,026
- Try these foods.
- Jiri Mountain must have good foods, right?

811
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:32,640
- Maybe seven different side dishes?
- Yes, maybe you're right.

812
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:38,384
- No, it's seven different genres.
- Then maybe seven different categories?

813
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:42,171
Maybe it's seven different foods
from all different categories.

814
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:45,439
- What is it?
- I hear sanyoosu fruit is famous here.

815
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,791
- Yes, you're right.
- Are you sure it's not dogwood fruit?

816
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:50,735
- No, it's sanyoosu.
- 'Sanyoosu'? You sure it's not 'Sansooyu'?

817
00:57:50,736 --> 00:57:53,113
Isn't 'Sansooyu' a name of a village?

818
00:57:53,114 --> 00:57:55,763
No, I think 'Sansooyu' is right.

819
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,651
Sanyoosu.

820
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,426
[Is it... or isn't it?]

821
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:02,800
What's the other clue?

822
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,897
<i>[The texture of this is
more unique than anything else.]</i>

823
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,264
- An agricultural crop?
- Agricultural crop.

824
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:10,426
What agricultural crops are there?

825
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,618
There are lots.
There are a countless number of them.

826
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:19,934
One of our clues said something
about an agricultural crop.

827
00:58:19,935 --> 00:58:21,528
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang is also
trying to decipher their clues.]

828
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:23,400
What does it say?
We have to guess what it is?

829
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:27,147
<i>[Agricultural crop that is produced
from our own soil.]</i>

830
00:58:27,148 --> 00:58:30,042
Agricultural crop that is produced
from our own soil... what's the next one?

831
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:36,067
<i>[Like the charming peacock,
both the red and the green are delicious.</i>

832
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:41,049
If it's produce...
then how about peppers?

833
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,583
[Could it be peppers?]

834
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:46,755
But apples can also be either
red or green.

835
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:50,705
- Depends on whether it's ripe or not...
- It could also be bell peppers.

836
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:54,784
- So we need another hint, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

837
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,930
[Just what is it that these clues
are indicating to?]

838
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:08,902
[Jiri Mountain's seven
item celebration event.]

839
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:12,456
- Ugh, I'm so hungry.
- I bet loser team doesn't get to eat.

840
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:14,715
- Then does this mean we don't get to eat?
- I don't think we'll be eating.

841
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:17,349
- All because of Suk Jin?
- Narsha, you got put on the wrong team.

842
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,327
Why did I have to be teamed up like this?
Who's responsible for this?

843
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,732
[But you've got some
very positive teammates.]

844
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:26,450
- Hello.
- Wow, what's that?

845

[The best southern delicacies-
Jiri Mountain's 20 dish feasting table.]

846
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:42,985
[This is the taste of the south.]

847
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:44,890
Everything looks so good!

848
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,992
- What's that?
- It's a loach stew.

849
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,028
[Delicious loach stew!]

850
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:53,430
- Is this whole loach stew?
- This is amazing.

851
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:55,997
Kim Kyung Ho,
you have to come this way.

852
00:59:55,998 --> 00:59:58,344
You can't go to the bathroom right now.

853
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,141
[Jiri Mountain's infamous red bean porridge.]

854
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:03,912
This is amazing.

855
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:07,322
[A feast just for us.]

856
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:11,600
- Wow, everything looks so delicious.
- It looks so good.

[A delicious and generous feast
of Jiri Mountain's 20 dish meal table.]

858
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:21,205
[Did you all get a good look?]

859
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:25,639
- I'm so hungry right now.
- Remember the placement of the dishes.

860
01:00:26,327 --> 01:00:28,452
[Oh no!]

861
01:00:28,453 --> 01:00:32,641
[What's this?]

862
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,085
[Hurry up and memorize it.]

863
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:41,639
[It's mission time!]

864
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:46,781
[What... is this?]

865
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:52,557
[In the blink of an eye, all 20
dishes get covered by a huge bowl!]

866
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:57,282
Doraji, bibim...

867
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,863
- Do not touch the table.
- Just let us eat.

868
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,651
Suk Jin keeps peeking under
the covers!

869
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:09,169
Suk Jin just forfeited one
of his chances.

870
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,591
[Suk Jin's naughty hand.]

871
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:13,516
- Suk Jin's needs to compensate for it!
- I like this rule!

872
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:18,958
- Stop being so dramatic.
- I seriously got the chills.

873
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:23,881
[Rocker groom-to be remains oblivious to
everything as he returns from the bathroom.]

874
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:27,471
- This is what I really hate.
- Hate what?

875
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:31,136
- He can't do anything right.
- You have to support your teammate.

876
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:33,639
I have nowhere else to go
if you guys turn on me, too.

877
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:37,242
- Are you all hungry?
- Yes.

878
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:42,818
Did you all get to see the dishes
that were laid out on the table?

879
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:45,499
Kyung Ho didn't get to see anything
because he was in the bathroom.

880
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,615
That's why I told him
not to go to the bathroom.

881
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:50,033
[What happened while I've
been gone?]

882
01:01:50,034 --> 01:01:52,738
He doesn't listen very well to others.

memory game.]

885

- That's what I thought.
- We have to use our brains.

886
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,434
Ugh, this is a thinking game.

887
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,245
[Take another good look!]

888
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:18,427
Of the numerous dishes laid out
on the table

889
01:02:18,843 --> 01:02:23,265
we will choose just one dish,
and present it to all of you.

890

dish is placed on the table.]

number of dishes wins the game.]

892

[Only the winning team of the game
can enjoy the taste of Jiri Mountain feast.]

893
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:41,714
If the dish you choose matches the dish
presented, only then can you enjoy the dish.

894
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:46,560
- I don't remember anything.
- Kyung Ho didn't even get to see anything.

895
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:49,900
But if our opposing team gets it wrong,
we still get to check where a certain dish is?

896
01:02:49,901 --> 01:02:52,687
[Figuring out the placement of the dishes
by other team's mistakes is advantageous.]

897
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:55,243
- Will they give us a chance to look first?
- No.

898
01:02:55,244 --> 01:02:58,961
Why did you go to the bathroom earlier
when he told you not to go?

899
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:03,286
Kyung Ho, you have to learn to hold it
when you're on a variety show.

900
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:07,038
Do I have to take this kind of abuse for
having gone to the bathroom for 3 minutes?

901
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,500
All this happened within
the three minutes you were gone.

902
01:03:10,002 --> 01:03:13,097
I can't stand this kind of
dirty playing and abuse.

903
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:15,523
You're forbidden from further
bathroom use.

904
01:03:15,524 --> 01:03:18,335
But look at how engrossed
Teuk is with everything.

905
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,507
[Teuk's engrossed position from having
been away from variety for so long.]

906
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:24,374
From what I'm seeing over here,
I don't think anyone here is quite sane.

907
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,409
It's because doing this
variety show made us this way.

908
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,954
Kyu Hyun used to smile all the time,
and I don't know what's happened to him.

909
01:03:30,955 --> 01:03:31,983
It's not that...

910
01:03:31,984 --> 01:03:34,926
but I want to make an example for
the young viewers

911
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:37,153
and in order to do that,
I think I need to bring Suk Jin down.

912
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:43,520
You're starting to act like Goo Ra.
You're close to Goo Ra these days, right?

913
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:45,934
I'm just trying to set an
example for all our young viewers.

914
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:47,700
Here's your first dish.

915
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,902
Your first question is a dish made with
a certain shellfish from Seomjin River.

916
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:54,773
A dish made with a certain shellfish
from Seomjin River.

917
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:59,260
It's a noodle dish made
with a certain type of shellfish.

918

- I know. Just trust me.
- You know?

922

[Jin Young attempts to sniff it out!]

924
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:24,208
If you get it wrong, then you must close it
to prevent the other teams from seeing it.

925

[Time to check the location
of the noodle dish!]

926
01:04:32,646 --> 01:04:34,728

Ji Suk Jin peeked again.

936

Ji Suk Jin, one more, and you lose
your chance to pick the next one.

- I'm right, but he says that I'm not.
- No, you're not!

954

- That's not right.
- That's deoduk.

959
01:06:35,812 --> 01:06:38,478
- How could you think that was doraji?
- Three!

960
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,080
Wow, we got it right!

961
01:06:45,597 --> 01:06:49,335
[Team Super Blank Ji and Team Yittagu
successfully earns the doraji muchim.]

962
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:51,844
[What a relief that they didn't
listen to Big-nose brother.]

963
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:53,760
This is really confusing.

964
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,540
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang has yet to
get anything correct.]

965
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,358
I got my dishes confused.

966
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:00,468
Bobby doesn't even know the names
of these side dishes.

967
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,880
He doesn't know anything
but pizza and hamburgers.

968
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:05,298
[Only familiar with pizza and
hamburgers.]

969
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:08,740
How are we getting everything wrong?
I can't believe we haven't gotten anything.

970
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,437
[Team Hong-Kook-Soo and
Team Sum-Jin-Kang have yet to get anything.]

971
01:07:10,438 --> 01:07:13,267
- We still have an ace up our sleeves.
- Like what?

972
01:07:13,268 --> 01:07:16,795
- What is it that we remember?
- There's that dish we remember.

973
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:21,434
Wow, they've got something
going on there.

974
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,115
That's what I'm saying.

975
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:25,019
[A love line between
Jin Young and Kkuk?]

976
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,417
- It's like a romantic comedy.
- I agree.

977
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,862
Kwang Soo, why are you looking
so old all of a sudden?

978
01:07:31,223 --> 01:07:33,073
[Giraffe's exhausted from all
the dirt digging from earlier.]

979
01:07:33,074 --> 01:07:34,803
Here's your third question.

980
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:37,156
- We may not get to eat anything.
- I don't remember anything.

981
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:42,339
Crab stew made with
fresh ocean crab is located where?

982
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,035
You know where it is, right?

983
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:50,425
[Everyone seems to know where this one is!]

984
01:07:50,426 --> 01:07:52,582
- You know where it is, right?
- Crab is mine!

985
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:58,983
One, two...
[Time to verify their answer!]

986
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:10,832
[Even Team Sum-Jin-Kang finally
gets their first dish!]

987
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,831
[Everyone successfully locates
the crab stew.]

988
01:08:14,597 --> 01:08:16,989
[You just wait, crab stew.]

989
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,193
It's natural for the eyes to gravitate
toward the best looking dish first.

990
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,113
You tend to look at the dish
that you want to eat the most.

991
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:23,975
[Huh?]

992
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:26,361
- Jae Suk! Jae Suk just took a bite!
- Wait!

993
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:30,654
- Jae Suk just took a bite!
- He just ate something!

994
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:33,404
- Jae Suk!
- He's not allowed to eat!

995
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,801
[While everyone's attention
is riveted on Jae Suk...]

996
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:40,049
[Blank Ji Hyo also sneaks
a bite of the crab stew.]

997
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,971
Can we kick Jae Suk out of the game
for having taken a bite?

998
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:44,681
[But it was still so good...]

999
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:46,207
Here's your fourth question.

1000
01:08:46,568 --> 01:08:48,919
Kim Kyung Ho, did you get to see
where even a single dish is placed?

1001
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,009
I know where six of the
dishes are placed.

1002
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,741
Six dishes?

1003
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:55,554
I've been paying attention to all the dishes
that other team's have gotten wrong.

1004
01:08:55,555 --> 01:08:57,200
[Been keeping a careful eye on the
wrong guesses that the other teams took.]

1005
01:08:57,201 --> 01:09:00,317
- Kyung Ho shouldn't be taken lightly.
- I think he's lying.

1006
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,536
[Kwang Soo, you just wait and see
with the next question...]

1007
01:09:04,537 --> 01:09:06,287
You're just afraid that
he's right, aren't you?

1008
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:10,561
Okay, here's your next question.
It's a very common dish in Jeollado.

1009
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:16,804
But that same dish is
made with sweet red beans here.

1010
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:19,024
[Made with sweet red beans...]

1011
01:09:19,025 --> 01:09:21,647
[Utterly clueless... sweet red beans?]

1012
01:09:22,686 --> 01:09:25,865
The sweet red bean porridge with
tiny dumplings is located where?

1013
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:29,681
I didn't get to see it.

1014
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,357
I can't tell you anything.

1015
01:09:34,358 --> 01:09:36,205
You must not remember
where it is?

1016
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:40,771
- Oh, that's right!
- You remember now?

1017
01:09:40,772 --> 01:09:42,646
- I'm going to take a guess.
- You have five seconds.

1018
01:09:43,403 --> 01:09:45,877
Five, four..

1019
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:51,311
[It's all in Jae Suk's hands now.]

1020
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:55,813
I actually got it!

1021
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:06,826
[Misses by one placement-
Acorn jelly muchim.]

1022
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:09,171
- I actually got it!
- I thought you said you guessed.

1023
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:12,564
[By pure luck, Team Sum-Jin-Kang earns
the sweet red bean porridge.]

1024
01:10:12,565 --> 01:10:15,204
[On the other hand,
Teams Gae-Jung-Bi and Yittagu miss.]

1025
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,258
Wow, I can't believe it.

1026
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,496
[I can't believe I got so lucky...]

1027
01:10:19,497 --> 01:10:21,042
I don't even like
sweet red bean porridge.

1028
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,246
Ugh, we were so close!

1029
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,424
Okay, let's keep at it.

1030
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:32,248
[Only one more question left to go.]

1031
01:10:32,249 --> 01:10:33,862
I'm so nervous.

1032
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,968
Please let it be something I know.

1033
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:38,286
Please!

1034
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:40,749
- We can do this.
- It's all down to luck now.

1035
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,663
If it's something we remember,
then we can win this thing.

1036
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:45,569
- Let's go with a tough question.
- Let's go for something we can mix.

1037
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,168
- Give us a tough question.
- No one can touch anything right now.

1038
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:53,105
What are you going to do about it?

1039
01:10:53,106 --> 01:10:55,531
- What are you going to do if I do?
- I was just saying that you can't.

1040
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:58,901
I'm just saying that you can't...

1041
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:04,751
The perfect companion to makgulli...
scallion pancakes.

1042
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:06,467
[Where are the scallion pancakes?]

1043
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:09,158
- I know where it is.
- Just hang on.

1044
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:13,441
[Leeteuk also seems to know
where it is.]

1045
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:18,015
[Jin Young also seems to
know where it is.]

1046
01:11:18,016 --> 01:11:19,660
Yes, that's right.

1047
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:22,864
Ah, I remember seeing this!

1048
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:30,782
- I think we're going to get to eat.
- One, two...

1049
01:11:30,783 --> 01:11:35,073
[The final question to the mission-
Where could the scallion pancakes be?]

1050
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:42,559

get to enjoy the 20 dish feast?]

1051

scallion pancake!]

the tied score... guess incorrectly.]

1054
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:59,377

Top rated snack regardless of age or gender.]

That's snail dumpling soup.

1064
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:44,964
- Wow, this is really unbelievable.
- That looks so good!

1065
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:47,927
- That looks like too much food for you.
- Look at this deoduk.

1066
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:50,656
- Can I try a bite?
- Can I get a bite, too?

1067
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:53,640
Narsha, I thought you said
that you like me.

1068
01:12:54,052 --> 01:12:55,813
Yes, I do like you.

1069
01:12:56,363 --> 01:12:58,880
- Are you really going to be like this?
- Bobby, what are you doing?

1070
01:12:58,881 --> 01:13:01,972
- What did Bobby say?
- He asked Narsha if she likes him.

[If you like me,
then give me just a bite...]

1082
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:03,008
For your final mission, you'll have to find
the real stage to Jiri Mountain concert.

1083
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:07,072
There are five stages that have been
set up for the Jiri Mountain event.

1084
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:12,014
Four of the five stages are fakes where
you'll find a penalty instead of music

1085
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:15,360
and only one of the stages is the real
one where the music will play through.

1086
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:25,012
Only the team that utilizes the clues earned
to figure out the real stage wins the race.

1087

Once all three members of a team steps
on stage, no further changes can be made.

1088
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:32,203
Behind the stage is a
two storied building.

1089
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:38,666
Hidden inside the building are 15 mics
that are marked with the 'R' sticker.

1090
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,228
I have to find the 'R' marked mics, right?

1091
01:14:41,813 --> 01:14:51,866
Each member must find one of the mics and
stand on the stage of your choosing.

Do you think we should split up?

I have to find the mic quickly.

1097
01:15:03,616 --> 01:15:07,431
- The mics are inside this building?
- I think it's the persimmon.

1098

I saw ginseng, melon, and apple down
there, but I think it's the persimmon.

1102
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:25,636
I think that's the best hint we've got.
It's either persimmon or dried persimmon.

1103
01:15:25,637 --> 01:15:27,250
- Right?
- Yes.

is the dried persimmon?]

Did you find one?
What the heck!

1110
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:55,868
He was standing right next to it.
How could he not have seen that?

1111

[Hides the mic she found,
and goes off to find another one.]

[Team Gae-Jung-Bi's Bobby
finds a mic of his own.]

it doesn't seem all that hard to find.

1116
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:16,487
- I've already looked, and there's nothing.
- You didn't find anything?

1117
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,201
- I really didn't find anything.
- Seriously?

1118
01:16:20,049 --> 01:16:21,669
Hello.

1119
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:24,159
[An office run-in.]

1120
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:27,695
[Huh?]

1121
01:16:28,606 --> 01:16:29,774
[A deep sigh of joy and relief.]

1122
01:16:29,775 --> 01:16:31,526
It must not be in here?

1123
01:16:31,527 --> 01:16:33,165
There must not be any in here?

1124
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:38,183
[Quietly... slips and runs away.]

1125
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:45,441
[Oh? Gary finds one, too!]

1126
01:16:46,717 --> 01:16:49,928
What other snacks could there
be that everyone likes?

1127
01:16:50,894 --> 01:16:53,984
- All I can think of is a persimmon.
- I think it's a persimmon, too.

1128
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:58,731
- I kept noticing the persimmon.
- Right? I kept noticing the persimmon, too.

1129
01:16:59,521 --> 01:17:02,174
[This team also believes that
the persimmon may be their answer.]

1130
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:05,634
- What other persimmon snack are there?
- Dried persimmons!

1131
01:17:07,246 --> 01:17:11,467
[Could their persimmon guess
be correct?]

1132
01:17:13,992 --> 01:17:17,170
[Team Gae-Jung-Bi currently have
two mics already in their possession.]

1133
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:21,913
[Gary finds another one!]

1134
01:17:21,914 --> 01:17:23,563
- You found one, didn't you?
- No, I haven't found any.

1135
01:17:23,564 --> 01:17:25,025
Bobby!

1136
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,646
- Jung In!
- Yes?

1137
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:29,193
[Team Gae-Jung-Bi is the first to
find all three mics for their team.]

1138
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,302
Run... hurry up and run!

1139
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:33,690
We have to run... hurry!

1140
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:37,983
[The only thing left to do now is for all
three members to go on stage together.]

1141
01:17:37,984 --> 01:17:40,064
Jung In, hurry!

1142
01:17:40,844 --> 01:17:43,515
Bobby, hang on.
We have to figure out which one.

1143
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:47,760
Gary already found all three mics?

1144
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:50,809
We have to pick one.
Come on, Jung In.

1145
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,401
[Gary hands a mic over to Jung In,
who wasn't able to find one on her own.]

1146
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:56,363
- Are we picking the persimmon?
- Apple, melon, ginseng?

1147
01:17:56,364 --> 01:17:59,237
- This is what I was thinking.
- Wait a minute.

1148
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:01,912
Which one could it be?

1149
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:04,438
- I think it's the persimmon.
- I think it is, too.

1150
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:06,316
Okay, let's go with the persimmon.

1151
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:08,813
[Just then, Team Super Blank Ji
comes running over!]

1152
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,805
[We want the persimmon!]

1153
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:13,989
[If we don't get on the stage first,
then it'll be taken away from us!]

1154
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,547
[Team Gae-Jung-Bi selects
the persimmon stage.]

1155
01:18:18,237 --> 01:18:21,005
[Team Super Blank Ji is
one step too late.]

1156
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:25,050
- How about the apple?
- You could be wrong about the persimmon.

1157
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:28,154
- Let's go for the apple.
- I think it's this one.

1158
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:33,599
[Immediately substitutes
the dogwood fruit for the persimmon.]

1159
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,372
None of our clues indicated
to that one.

1160
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:36,711
I don't think it's that one.

1161
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:39,635
[Team Super Blank Ji selects
the dogwood fruit stage.]

1162
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:45,631
[Team Hong-Kook-Soo finds
their second mic.]

1163
01:18:45,632 --> 01:18:47,580
I can't run anymore right now.

1164
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:52,609
[Jin Young's battery is depleted.]

1165
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,765
- Kwang Soo!
- Let's take the elevator.

1166
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,559
[Busy searching for the mic,
and busy taking care of Jin Young...]

1167
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,972
Here it is.

1168
01:19:01,973 --> 01:19:03,409
I found one.

1169
01:19:06,061 --> 01:19:09,195
Apple, pear, melon...

1170
01:19:09,196 --> 01:19:11,061
ginseng...

1171
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:12,969
Apple?
Could it be the apple?

1172
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:15,527
Apple could also mean to apologize.
('Sa-gwa' Apple= Sorry.)

1173
01:19:15,528 --> 01:19:17,313
[Apple could mean, sorry.)

1174
01:19:17,314 --> 01:19:20,147
We'd like to introduce Super Junior's
hit song, 'Sorry Sorry'.

1175
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:22,167
- What?
- What's that supposed to mean?

1176
01:19:22,795 --> 01:19:28,734
[Rubbing the two hands together
in a gesture of an apology...]

1177
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:31,347
Apple?
Could it be the apple?

1178
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,763
It's the apple!

1179
01:19:35,827 --> 01:19:37,611
- Suk Jin, did you find it?
- I did, did you?

1180
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:39,270
- Where's Narsha?
- I figured it out.

1181
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:42,032
- I know what it is. Come here.
- What is it?

1182
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:46,046
- It's the apple. Apple as in apology.
- Okay!

1183
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:48,610
- Okay, you're right.
- Did you find one or not?

1184
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:50,311
[Only one more mic left to find
for Team Yittagu!]

1185
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:51,779
Narsha!

1186
01:19:56,126 --> 01:19:59,318
[Kyung Ho also finds a mic!]

1187
01:20:00,407 --> 01:20:02,096
Kyung Ho!

1188
01:20:04,783 --> 01:20:07,243
[Jae Suk also has a mic in his hand!]

1189
01:20:07,244 --> 01:20:09,261
- Kyung Ho!
- Where are you?

1190
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:17,431
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang suddenly has
all three mics in their possession!]

1191
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:20,394
Narsha!
Narsha, run!

1192
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:23,090
[Team Yittagu also finds
their one last mic.]

1193
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:24,697
Run!
Run down here!

1194
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:27,236
[Team Yittagu is on the move!]

1195
01:20:28,775 --> 01:20:31,227
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang also heads
towards the stage.]

1196
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:34,911
Hurry.
Please let the stage be empty.

1197
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:37,139
- Please let the stage be empty.
- Hurry!

1198
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,328
[If the stage is occupied by another team,
then their efforts will be wasted!]

1199
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:41,840
The Blue Team is up on the stage!

1200
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:45,378
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang takes the
apple stage?]

1201
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:47,781
That team headed directly
over to the apple stage.

1202
01:20:50,924 --> 01:20:53,599
- They already took it.
- What?

1203
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,321
- The stage is already taken.
- We're positive that this is the right one.

1204
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:04,031
[The hint that they earned after having
won their second mission.]

1205
01:21:04,483 --> 01:21:07,668
Something that's delicious whether
it's green or red...

1206
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:12,709
- There are so many possibilities.
- But that sign said apples and persimmons.

1207
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:15,849
- There's a good chance that it's an apple.
- I think it's the apple.

1208
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:21,010
[Team Sum-Jin-Kang guessed that it's
an apple right from the get go...]

1209
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:25,309
[Team Yittagu steps onto
the adjacent melon stage.]

1210
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:29,977
[Team Hong-Kook-Soo is the
last team to arrive.]

1211
01:21:29,978 --> 01:21:32,553
[Steps onto the ginseng stage
without a choice.]

1212
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,399
You have all made your
stage selections.

1213
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,095
- This is not what we were thinking.
- This is not what we wanted.

1214
01:21:38,096 --> 01:21:41,033
Of the five stages...

1215
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:43,247
only one is the real stage.

1216
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:46,759
Four of these stages are fake stages.

1217
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:49,819
I can see the flour sifting out of this one.

1218
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:55,758
It's time to reveal the answer,
and the rest will be penalized!

1219
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:58,075
Is something going to fall out?
Wait...

1220
01:21:58,723 --> 01:22:00,935
[Which one of these is the real stage?]

1221
01:22:00,936 --> 01:22:02,372
Please!

1222
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:07,281

1228

[Melon stage- Introducing
Super Junior's hit song, 'Sorry Sorry'.]

1229
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:32,784

and one of Jiri Mountain's best!]

1230
01:22:33,507 --> 01:22:36,426

1231
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:44,802

is the real stage!]

01:22:55,444 --> 01:23:00,408
[A flour snowfall in November.]

1234
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:07,389
[All these hints were
indicating to the apple.]

1235
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,073
[Yoo Jae Suk, Kim Kyung Ho,
and Kim Yeon Woo wins!]

1236
01:23:11,614 --> 01:23:14,184
Why did you put so much
flour in there?

1237
01:23:14,185 --> 01:23:17,176
There never used to be this much flour!

1238
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:23,020
[The final event of the day...]

1239
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:25,096

the falling flour.]

1242
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:47,270
Today's prize is an array of the seven
gifts Jiri Mountain has to offer!

1243
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:50,034
[Apple, melon, dogwood fruit, green tea,
persimmon, ginseng, and wooden container.]

1244
01:23:50,035 --> 01:23:55,922
I'd like for the new groom-to-be,
Kyung Ho to take the ginseng.

1245
01:23:55,923 --> 01:23:58,577
[Ginseng goes to the new
groom-to-be, Kyung Ho.]

1246
