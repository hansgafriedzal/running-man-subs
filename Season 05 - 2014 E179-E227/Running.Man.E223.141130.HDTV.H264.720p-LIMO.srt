- Hello.

114
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:19,111
You must be tired.
Enjoy a nice cup of healthy drink.

115

Drink it all up.

116

124
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:53,977
[Completely befuddled from the realistic
acting from the man in the hiking gear.]

125
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:57,312
- Aren't you Chul Soo?
- No, I'm Kwang Soo.

126
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,152
My name is Kwang Soo!

127
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:08,187

in the clear...]

[Fifth mission starts in the midst
of his confusion.]

130
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,788
What is this?

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,838
You guys should've been
more careful!

132
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,955
I'll just be going now.

133
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:33,362
[Picks up the last bottle,
and clears the fifth mission.]

134

00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,067
[A dead run towards exit number four.]

136
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:41,420
[Even though it may seem
like it's over...]

137
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,035
[The darned stairs!]

138
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,515
[Is this a morning commute or
a hiking adventure?]

139
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:59,318
[His workday hasn't even started,
and he already looks beat.]

140
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:03,268
[Worker Kwang's morning commute
is complete.]

141
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,189
[Extremely exhausting morning commute.]

142
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:18,455

I've ever had to drink before.</i>

143
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:23,846

completed his own morning commute.]

144

[The three workers are left sitting
side-by-side while waiting for others.]

145
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:31,324
- Ha Ha's most curious about Suk Jin.
- I'm so curious to see how Suk Jin does.

146
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:34,772
- I wish I were Suk Jin.
- You're a fan of Suk Jin, aren't you?

147
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,898
- I'm also a fan of his.
- I'm a total fan of his.

148
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,607
I really filled up those tea cups
before I left.

149
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,598
Good job. You got it
ready for the next player?

150
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,280
[A few minutes prior.]

151
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,767
I don't think that was enough bitter tea.

152
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:51,166
Can you really fill up the cup
for the next person?

153
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:54,615
[A full cup of the bitter tea
for the next person.]

154
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:57,180
Are you aware that the cooler the tea
gets, more bitter it becomes?

155
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,779
- How about another cup of tea for the road?
- No, I'm fine.

156
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,612
No, I'm fine.

157
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,856
- That's so you.
- You're the dirtiest player I know.

158
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,493
[This man would definitely survive
the tough corporate world.]

that they've all been waiting for?]

162
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:23,074
[Fourth new hire, Ji Suk Jin.]

163
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:26,656
- I'm a new hire at 'R' Group.

Ji Suk Jin.
It's Big-nose time!

167
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,468

00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,756
- Wow, he's really fast.
- How is he so fast?

332
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:26,446
- He squeezed through the corner.
- He's moving really fast.

333
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:33,350
[Even climbs up the 70 flights of stairs
in the blink of an eye.]

334
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:37,094
I have no strength left in my legs.

335
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,600
- Hello.
- You must be so tired.

336
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:44,307
- Why don't you have a cup of this tea?
- No, I have to get going.

337
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:50,146
[Since he's told to drink it,
he tries to gulp it down in a rush.]

338
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:52,398
- You have to finish it.
- It's so bitter! What is this?

339
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,227
[It's a healthy cup of bitter tea.]

340
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,901
- I'm already healthy.
- You have to finish the tea.

341
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:07,345
[Even those watching the scene can
relieve the bitter taste of the tea.]

342
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:10,114
Gary's still much quicker
than I thought he'd be.

343
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,134
- I think Gary has the best time.
- I think he's the fastest one of us all.

344
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:16,155
- It's me, So Hyun.
- No, you've got the wrong person!

345
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,419
[Making it to work on time
is all I care about right now!]

346
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,183
No, I'm Gary!

347
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,912
I'm just Gary!

348
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,722
[Worker Gae flies through
his fourth mission.]

349
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:25,614
Why is the morning commute
so exhausting?

350
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:27,584
[Okay, here we come!]

351
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,495
[Time for the fifth mission.]

352
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,336
[Attempts to ignore and just run past it.]

353
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,445
[Crushed by reality.]

354
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:46,085
[Attempts his second escape.]

355
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:49,629
[But forcefully gets detained
for the second time.]

356
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,640
- He's trying to run away.
- He's running away.

357
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:56,079
[Worker Gae's single minded determination
brings a huge round of laughter.]

358
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:03,418
[Let me just get to work!]

359
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,533
Okay, I'm leaving!
Good day!

360
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:11,106
[After a polite saying of farewell,
heads straight towards exit number four.]

361
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:15,179
[Please let there be an escalator...]

362
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:17,620
Ugh, more stairs!

363
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:24,451
[Still starts to climb
without any hesitation.]

364
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,240
[Worker Gae completes his morning commute.]

365
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:33,381
[Worker Gae completes his
commute faster than others.]

366
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,363
Wow, that was really exhausting.

367
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:39,012
I don't think I can do this job.

368
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,635
I don't think I'm cut out
for this commuting thing.

369
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,241
[Your first morning commute is your last?]

370
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:51,906
Thanks for the effort you all
put into your morning commute.

371
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,363
Morning commute is a battlefield.

372
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:57,086
I have so much respect for all those
who make the commute every morning.

373
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,658
Today's race will allow you to experience
the lives of Korea's office workers

374
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,763
in a race called,
The Workers' Super Race.

375
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,761
The member with the best results from
each round of missions

376
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:11,407
will be given a promotion mission, which will
allow them to go onto the final mission.

377
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:15,121
For the final promotion mission...

378
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:20,428
bets will be made on the member whom the
real employees will be cheering on to win.

379
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,308
[Employees will bet on Running Man members.]

380
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:27,428
The final winner and those who cheered for
the winner will win an exceptional prize.

381
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,071
You will also be given the chance
to advance yourselves.

382
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:33,008
Ha Ha's commuting time
will be announced first.

383
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,550
- Okay, what's his record?
- Everyone was too aggressive for my turn.

384
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:41,248
- What was his time?
- Ha Ha's time was, 4 minutes and 46 seconds.

385
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,358
[Worker Ha-
Four minutes and 46 seconds.]

386
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,070
We don't know who had the best time yet.

387
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,868
- Worker Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes.

388
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:50,807
- Four minutes...
- I thought he was faster!

389
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,309
and 11 seconds.

390
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:56,566
- That's not much of a difference.
- He's currently in first place.

391
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,564
For Worker Lee Kwang Soo,
his time was, four minutes...

392
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,123
- Wow, he's that close?
- And 14 seconds.

393
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:04,901
[Worker Kwang-
Four minutes and 14 seconds.]

394
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:09,216
[Worker Yoo maintains his first place spot
by a mere three second difference.]

395
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:11,051
- That's funny, I won.
- Ji Suk Jin.

396
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,366
- Only a three second difference.
- Worker Ji Suk Jin...

397
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:17,125
[Worker Big-nose...
Five minutes and 25 seconds.]

398
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,767
[The unchallenged last place.]

399
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,283
Everyone seriously worked really
hard to obstruct my way.

400
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:25,408
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes?

401
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,416
- Four minutes...
- He's in the four minute mark, too?

402
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,375
- Four minutes 48 seconds.
- You're still in first place!

403
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:34,161
[Worker Yoo is in the current lead with
the time of four minutes and 11 seconds.]

404
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:38,787
- Our plan worked!
- It's because you guys interfered.

405
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,150
- Coming in at first place is what matters.
- Yes, it doesn't matter otherwise.

406
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:43,088
Worker Song Ji Hyo.

407
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,760
- Four minutes...
- Ji Hyo's in the four minute range, too?

408
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:49,122
- Four minutes and 47 seconds.
- What is this!

409
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:51,909
- What the heck?
- What if I really win first place?

410
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:55,284
- Ji Hyo was fast though.
- Were you really that fast?

411
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:59,274
- I don't know about Gary though.
- Worker Gary...

412
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:03,527
- He took too long at the last mission.
- He wasted time with those bottles.

413
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:05,816
- He was really fast though.
- Was he faster than Jae Suk?

414
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:09,832
- Four minutes...
- Wait, did Jae Suk have 11 seconds?

415
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,611
Tell us what the last number is.
Just the final ending number.

416
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:18,489
- Two.
- If it's 12 seconds, then I'll win.

417
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:23,064
[Unless it's two seconds,
Worker Yoo wins regardless.]

418
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,344
Worker Gary's time was four minutes...

419
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:32,988
[What is Gary's record?]

420
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,774
Four minutes and two seconds.

421
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,674
[Four minutes and two seconds.]

422
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,649
- Can you guys be happy for me?
- Why are you shouting?

423
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,223
I feel like I'm the only one
happy about this.

424
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:43,980
[Worker Gae wins the morning commute
mission and thus gets promoted.]

425
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:47,757
<i>- Let's just get going.
- There's a bus for our commute.</i>

426
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:50,449
[A commuting bus will be used as
their means of transportation.]

427
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,985
- We're all coworkers.
- Are you sure you're not my senior?

428
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,839
No, we're not seniors or
juniors to each other yet.

429
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,837
[Gary is given a chance at a promotion at the
final mission for winning the first round.]

430
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,348
Where are we going now?

431
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:07,643
- Off to another mission, I'm sure.
- People who have to do that commute...

432
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:12,970
- They really need to be commended.
- That's what most people do every morning.

433
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,807
Just climbing up those stairs
exhausted me.

434
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,273
That's why we slept
in the classroom every morning.

435
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,856
I bet it's exhausting for them.

436
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,364
[Second mission- The art of flattery]

437
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,509
'I love you, Director.'
What is this?

438
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:32,808
Welcome to your second mission,
A flattery convention.

439
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:37,728
- Flattery?
- It's a welcoming rally for the new director.

440
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:43,425
You have to participate in the game
according to how the director wants it.

441
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:47,383
[The new director of 'R' Group-
Choi Hyun Ho.]

442
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:51,519
[A former national handball player.]

443
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,079
[Have made appearances on variety shows,
dramas, and even movies and now, in RM.]

444
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:58,067
- Welcome, Director.
- Hello, Director.

445
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:01,788
- Hyun Ho?
- Yes, hello.

446
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,418
[It's been a while, Worker Yoo Jae Suk.]

447
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:07,078
[Let's see how well you do!
Calling all workers to attention!]

448
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,298
Director!
Director!

449
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,422
- I started the chant.
- He has a way of making me feel awkward.

450
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:19,408
- I was born in 1985, so don't feel that way.
- Congratulations, Director!

451
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:20,714
[Worker Kwang bows down in determination
not to lose out to anyone.]

452
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:23,974
- I like him the best.
- Is that the sort of thing you like?

453
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,316
- That's what you like, huh?
- I'll give it my best effort.

454
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:30,816
I was recently brought onto this position
and there seems to be some negative talk

455
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:35,112
about the fact that I'm still so young
and was a former athlete.

456
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:38,885
- No, not at all. Who's saying that?
- I won't let them get away with it!

457
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:41,928
You're only here because you've proven
you had the skills for the position.

458
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,034
- We won't stand for this slander.
- Someone got you this position, right?

459
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,787
[What? He got the job
through connections?]

460
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:50,864
- What are you talking about?
- He's the one who started the rumors.

461
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,677
That mouth of his!
That's how we all got in here!

462
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:56,356
[Worker Yoo's big word stumble.]

463
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,792
Let's move past the fact that you're my
subordinates and that I'm your superior

464
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:03,092
- and just have a great time together.
- Sounds great! I'm ready for some fun!

465
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,816
- Wow, you're so handsome.
- He's so cool, too.

466
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,586
[Rally prizes- Kimchi fridge, digital camera,
and mixed coffee set.]

467
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,896
A real kimchi fridge?

468
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:14,226
Your first category is, sit-ups.

469
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:19,800
The winner will be determined by who does
the most amount of sit-ups in 30 seconds.

470
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:23,366
- Sit-ups?
- Something I'd like to mention...

471
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:28,197
is the fact that I actually have my eyes
on the third place winner's prize.

472
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,157
[The prize that the Director
has his eyes on.]

473
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:36,273
- I don't have a very refined taste buds.
- We need the director to come in third.

474
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:39,148
We can't come in at first place,
but need to come in at third place.

475
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,994
I really want to come in at third place.

476
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:44,614
- I hope you're not burdened by this.
- Yes, I understand.

477
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:46,890
[Feeling extremely burdened.]

478
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,922
I feel like the Director is
going to be really good at this.

479
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,636
I'll just buy you the mixed coffee set.

480
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:58,349
I really don't like flattery.
You can't try to help me on this, okay?

481
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,192
How can we do this and
not make it look obvious?

482
00:29:01,193 --> 00:29:03,440
- Okay, I'm going to get started.
- Okay.

483
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:07,461
- I'll hold onto your legs for you.
- Wow, you really are the best.

484
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:09,915
- Thank you.
- I knew I liked you for a reason.

485
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,358
- Ugh, seriously.
- Don't forget about third place, Kwang Soo.

486
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,996
- Seriously... Just take your time.
- Okay.

487
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:19,474
- 30 seconds.
- Get ready... start!

488
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:24,828
- One, two, three...
- Take it easy.

489
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,014
You should take it easy.
You said you wanted the third place.

490
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,713
[Sit-ups at full speed.]

491
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,201
- Eight, nine...
- At this rate, you'll come in at first place!

492
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,615
- We're in trouble.
- Why are you doing it so fast?

493
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:37,749
- You don't have to do it like this.
- I have a bad back already.

494
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,201
- 18, 19...
- My back isn't at its best right now.

495
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:45,395
- Do you have something against us?
- Why are you doing it to this extent?

496
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:46,933
[We're ruined.]

497
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:51,312
- 28, 29, 30, 31...
- What is this!

498
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:53,741
- He's doing more than one sit-up per second?
- He's not slowing down one bit!

499
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,764
- 35, 36...
- Stop. He has 36.

500
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:58,496
[Director Choi Hyun Ho succeeds
in getting 36 sit-ups.]

501
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,706
How are you going to get third place
when you do it like that?

502
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:04,289
Then how many do we have to do?
37 of them?

503
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,737
[There needs to be two people who
can beat the Director's record.]

504
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,652
You do it, Gary.
You should go first.

505
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:14,160
- We have to succeed right away.
- You're not planning something, are you?

506
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:17,595
We have to succeed right away, and
not make it look obvious when we fail.

507
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:18,792
[Worker Kwang's idea- Succeed right away,
then fail without making it look obvious.]

508
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:22,656
- You have to do a good job.
- Worker Gae, do a good job, okay?

509
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,787
- You have to do your best.
- You need to do 37 sit-ups.

510
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:27,080
Even if your stomach rips,
you still have to do it.

511
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:29,293
- Do it no matter what it takes.
- Even if my stomach rips, I'll still do it.

512
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:33,845
- Worker Gae, you need to get 37.
- It's been a while since I've done this.

513
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:35,453
He's good at this.

514
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,872
- My shirt feels tight around here.
- Why would you say it like that?

515
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:41,888
[Director Choi seems to be in a good mood
and breaks out into a big smile.]

516
00:30:42,786 --> 00:30:44,790
Set, go!

517
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,407
[Speedy!]

518
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,556
Gary's seriously so ugly.

519
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:58,431
[I don't care if this makes me look ugly
as long as it makes Director Choi happy.]

520
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,403
You need to do it faster!

521
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:03,469
- You have to do this!
- Faster!

522
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:09,065
[At this rate... he might actually beat him!]

523
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,135
[Current standing.
Choi Hyun Ho- 36. Gary- 34.]

524
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:21,230
[Even though I did it until
I felt I was lit on fire...]

525
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:23,102
He did a great job.

526
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:26,071
I don't think Director Choi
will get third place.

527
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:28,511
I don't think Director Choi is
going to come in at third place.

528
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,148
We need to get Director Choi
his coffee mix!

529
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,741
Ji Hyo, why don't you try it?
Ji Hyo's really fast.

530
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:37,209
[Worker Blank is more trustworthy than
this group of male workers?]

531
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,969
- Hi Hyo, we need 37.
- We're in trouble if Ji Hyo can't do this.

532
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,464
- Ji Hyo, you have to do this.
- I will do my best.

533
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,720
- Give it your best.
- Start!

534
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:53,900
[Worker Blank's woodpecker imitation.]

535
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:57,806
[May be cheating a bit, but still
attempts to surpass the 36 mark.]

536
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,237
- She looks like a woodpecker.
- She may even surpass the 100 mark.

537
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:10,318
[The victory is right in front of her eyes!]

538
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,114
- 38, 39, 40!
- You did it!

539
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:16,868
[Worker Blank succeeds with 39 sit-ups.]

540
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,843
Even though it's a bit embarrassing,
we still did it.

541
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:23,793
[Current standing:  Song Ji Hyo- 39.
Choi Hyun Ho- 36, Gary- 34.]

542
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,983
Yes, very impressive.

543
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,750
- Yes, that was a great job.
- She gave it her best effort.

544
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,415
[Just one more person to surpass the 36
mark to get Director Choi his coffee mix.]

545
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,495
- Wow, this could be embarrassing.
- You have a shorter distance to go up.

546
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,700
- You might be able to do it.
- Good.

547
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,591
Good, ready... go!

548
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:53,262
[Worker Ha is giving it his best.]

549
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:58,096
[I will sacrifice my body for
Director Choi's happiness.]

550
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,235
Is he being fast with this?

551
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:05,896
[Exhaustion sets in.]

552
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,519
[Already at the end of his wits...]

553
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:10,720
[Just a little bit more!]

554
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,635
It's not over yet.
34!

555
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:19,964
[Worker Ha succeeds in getting
33 sit-ups.]

556
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,552
- It's because he got too excited.
- That's his show of excitement.

557
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,435
[Whatever the case,
Director Choi is still in second place.]

558
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,957
You must've liked doing sit-ups.

559
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,784
- He really likes it.
- I never knew he liked it so much.

560
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,327
[Worker Ha can liven up
any atmosphere.]

561
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:34,237
[Worker Ha is the best!]

562
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:37,586
[Worker Yoo succeeds in getting 30.]

563
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:40,095
- Worker Kim Jong Kook's in great shape.
- Yes, he is.

564
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,446
Worker Kim Jong Kook is our last hope.
- Come and help support us!

565
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:45,801
- Okay, ready!
- Don't be shy to cheer him on!

566
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:48,393
- You have to get 37.
- Set, go!

567
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:53,213
[Speedy as predicted!]

568
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:55,462
Wow, he's so fast!

569
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:57,754
[Nice, Worker Kkuk!]

570
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,782
[Worker Kkuk's lightning fast pace!]

571
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:06,651
[We can do this!]

572
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:10,677
Just seven more!
1, 2, 3, 4...

573
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,735
[I vow to succeed!]

574
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,330
[Worker Kkuk succeeds in getting 38!]

575
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,680
[Task complete-
Director Choi comes in at third place.]

576
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:26,899
[Current standing: Song Ji Hyo- 39.
Kkuk- 38, Director Choi- 36.]

577
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,399
[Mr. Capable even in the corporate world!]

578
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,950
- I can't even move my neck.
- Who cares? Director Choi got third place.

579
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:38,814
- Get him out of the way.
- Good job!

580
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:43,623
The game is over, so get up. How dare
you sprawl out in front of the director?

581
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,184
[Cruel corporate world-
Worker Kkuk is met with hostility already.]

582
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:52,724
- Worker Kwang, it's your turn.
- No need to get 40 now.

583
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:57,458
- Why don't you try going for 37?
- I don't like effortless attempts.

584
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:00,505
- No, I'd never do that.
- None of us in here would do that.

585
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:03,796
- I will give it my best.
- Fighting, Kwang Soo.

586
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,156
[Just needs to get less than 36.]

587
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,631
Director Choi doesn't like
effortless attempts.

588
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,410
- Wow, look at how handsome he looks.
- That's a nice look on his face.

589
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,436
[Worker Kwang, you can slow down now...]

590
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:25,068
- Slow down or you'll do 30.
- You're approaching 30.

591
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:28,260
That's enough.

592
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:31,059
[A warning to Worker Kwang to
stop working so hard at it.]

593
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:34,398
[Enough, dummy!]

594
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:40,658
Grab his head!

595
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,432
- Let me go, I'm going to do this!
- Grab his head!

596
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:45,946
[Giraffe, on the verge of an explosion.]

597
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,463
[Director Choi is so happy to
win his mixed coffee set.]

598
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,720
[Worker Kwang succeeds in getting 35.]

599
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:59,411
[All my co-workers did such a great job.]

600
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,491
Great job everyone.

601
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,199
[Succeeds in having Director Choi
coming in at third place.]

602
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,182
Here's your next category-
Ball tossing.

603
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:11,923
You have to throw the ball to knock down
the most number of bottles to win.

604
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:15,083
- Director Choi used to be a handball player.
- This is too greatly in his favor.

605
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:16,486
[This puts us at a huge disadvantage.]

606
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:20,376
[1st- Overseas vacation, 2nd- Coffee machine,
3rd- Napa cabbage kimchi.]

607
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,078
- No, can't be...
- You all know what I want, right?

608
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,355
- Yes.
- We have tons of kimchi at home for you.

609
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:28,085
My family is into farming napa cabbages.

610
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,967
I had a feeling you'd like kimchi,
so I have a whole box of it out in the car.

611
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,588
But I still want the kimchi prize.

612
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,827
- Why is he being like this?
- Seriously... why is he like this?

613
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,179
The kimchi smells so delicious right now.

614
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,234
Is this what stress is really like?

615
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:46,550
- Work stress?
- It just smells so good.

616
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,803
[Does the former national handball
player still have his skills?]

617
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:55,832
[Only ten balls-
How many bottles will he get?]

618
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,897
- That was...
- He hit that right on.

619
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:06,762
- He was dead on with his accuracy.
- You have to leave us a chance.

620
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:12,103
[A bulls eye on two out of the ten bottles.]

621
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,108
- Why don't you take it easy?
- Excuse me?

622
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,634
Sorry, that was my mistake.

623
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:23,340
[Four bottles in a row.]

624
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,005
Just take it easy!

625
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,311
[This won't do!
We need to disrupt him.]

626
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:35,155
No, Director Choi!

627
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,267
[Plans to disrupt succeeds.]

628
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:42,157
[Four bottles down, and fails one.]

629
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:51,655
[Re-focuses on task at hand.]

630
00:37:55,861 --> 00:38:00,550
[Fails to break his focus, and he
succeeds in knocking down his 7th.]

631
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,694
You're having too much fun with this.

632
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:05,368
It's been awhile since I've held a ball,
and this is making me so happy right now.

633
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,619
You should've just worked harder
when you had the chance.

634
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:13,444
[Final count- Director Choi succeeds
in knocking down seven out of the ten.]

635
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:17,665
- Director Choi, we'll take our turn now.
- Fighting.

636
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:20,949
Come on, Jae Suk.

637
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:25,768
[Worker Yoo fails first of the ten.]

638
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,369
No need to throw it too hard.

639
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,969
[Knocks one down and fails one.]

640
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:39,970
There you go!

641
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,644
[Knocks two down and fails one.]

642
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,210
- Jae Suk, I knew you could do it.
- You're doing great.

643
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:47,502
Worker Yoo has the feel for it.

644
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,077
[Knocks two down and fails three.]

645
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:53,755
I need to kill two birds with one stone.

646
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:55,114
[In order to knock down more than seven,
he needs to knock two down with one throw.]

Put a little spin in your throw.

648

[Please hit the bottle!]

649
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,586
[Fail]

- Just have fun with it.
- What's wrong with you?

- I'm going to quit this company!
- What are you doing in front of the Director?

658
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:30,685
I need to just quit this job!

659
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,416
Why are we just playing games
instead of working?

660
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:37,023
- Worker Yoo's got a temper.
- He's trying to calm down.

661
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,756
I'm here to work, not play games!

- Get yourself some water.
- I'm going to keep working for this company.

666
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,818
Thank you for that.

667

[All-around sportsman,
Worker Kkuk, to the challenge.]

[But fails.]

671
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:18,831
- Throw it harder, Jong Kook.
- What's wrong with this guy?

672
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:22,089
- You have to throw it harder.
- This is stressing me out again.

673
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,784
Wow, he's really awful at it.

674
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:28,232
This is so aggravating!

675
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:33,011
[Worker Yoo's on a rampage.]

676
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,463
- Ugh, this is so aggravating!
- Director Choi is watching!

677

job anymore!]

coolly enjoying the show.]

- I'm sorry.

681

- I was just angry at myself.
- Okay, I can do this!

684
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:07,274
[Only Worker Blank succeeds in getting 8,
and Director Choi is still in second place.]

685
00:41:07,275 --> 00:41:09,888
- You can do this.
- Ready...

686
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:12,113
[Worker Big-nose is their last hope.]

687
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,850
- I don't think what he's doing is right.
- That doesn't look right to me.

688
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,191
[A direct hit!]

689
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:24,668
I think he's got the feel for this.

690
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:26,069
[Worker Big-nose's surprising start.]

691
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,009
I think I can do this.

692

- That has to appear larger to you.
- Don't talk to me right now.

693

Are you getting annoyed
with us right now?

[Knocks down his second bottle
in a row!]

695
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:43,354
I guess that actually works.

696

[Big-nosed Brother's lucky day.]

697
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,376
This is Suk Jin's day to shine this year.

698
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,975
- He's got the feel for it now.
- He looks good.

699
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,645
- Look at how focused he is.
- Maybe he really will get it.

700
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:04,070
[The ball misses its mark...]

701
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,254
- No, you've still got it.
- We're still good, let's keep it up.

702
00:42:07,255 --> 00:42:10,804
- We've still got a chance, right?
- We're still good. You can do this.

703

00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:27,832
- That bottle has to look larger in size.
- Can you just stop talking?

00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,429
[Sorry...]

709

[Let's take this all the way today!]

721

I can't believe this.

[Big-nose's ninth ball.]

724

at once. You never know.

- Okay.
- It may work.

[He's on a roll, so a
miracle may actually happen...]

No, just do it like this and
knock them all down.

728
00:43:52,453 --> 00:43:55,434
- I have a feeling you may get it.
- I think you can get it, too.

- But what did you say earlier?
- I couldn't control my emotions earlier.

739
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,655
Since I did come in at third place once,
I would like to reward you for it.

I have prepared seven envelopes

743
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:54,049
and the one with the biggest cash prize
in the envelope wins first place.

744
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,124
Is it totally random then?

745
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,395
You're so fun!

746
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,916
[One step above flattery.]

747
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:05,721
On the count of three, you can all go up
there and grab the envelope you want.

748

- This is a competition in itself.
- I'm going to get promoted!

in any sort of competition.]

- Don't you think that you're too harsh?

752
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,221
- You can't grab it and set it back down.

00:59:42,198 --> 00:59:44,753
- Run, Jake is the only one left.
- Really?

977
00:59:44,754 --> 00:59:47,195
Jake is the only one left?

978
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:52,485
[The war isn't over yet.]

979
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,028
[Jake flies into the air to avoid the attack.]

980
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:06,457
[Jake turns around and
starts his counterattack.]

981
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:15,270
[Worker Big-nose breaks the negotiation.]

982
01:00:17,425 --> 01:00:19,967
[Workers Yoo and Kkuk
enter the lecture hall.]

983
01:00:19,968 --> 01:00:21,286
You're ousted?

984
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:23,978
[I have to eliminate Jake
before the others get here.]

985
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,845
Okay, good.

986
01:00:28,361 --> 01:00:31,437
[If he can just eliminate Jake, then
Worker Kwang may get his chance.]

987
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:35,006
[If left alone, Worker Kwang might
get his chance at a promotion!]

988
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:37,274
[Let me just get my promotion!]

989
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,227
- No!
- Jake is out!

990
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,980
[Another Hollywood ending.]

991
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:57,557
[Worker Kwang gets his
second name tag.]

992
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:04,198
[Worker Kwang's final spurt
in a show of performance.]

993
01:01:05,506 --> 01:01:07,687
[The end of negotiation.]

994
01:01:07,688 --> 01:01:10,014
Team Running Man wins.

995
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:15,484
[Team Running Man succeeds in
their deal with the foreign buyers.]

996
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,654
[But the chance at a promotion
goes to only one person.]

997
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:21,393
Ha Ha eliminated Fabien and Mark.

998
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:23,568
[Worker Ha signs both Fabien
and Mark's name tags.]

999
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:29,192
Lee Kwang Soo eliminated both
Jake and Brad's name tags.

1000
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:33,528
He also has two, so they will both
be given the chance at a promotion.

1001
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:38,411
[The win is tied between
Workers Ha and Kwang.]

1002
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:41,103
- Kwang Soo got both in the end.
- It's all thanks to you.

1003
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:44,159
[Worker Kwang also earns his chance
at a promotion.]

1004
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,825
[Thanks to the seven special guests for their
appearance and for their love for Korea.]

1005
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,973
[It all now boils down to
the final promotion exam.]

1006
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:58,119
[Final round-
A chance to turn their lives around.]

1007
01:01:58,488 --> 01:02:02,938
[Returning to the office, where the lights
still burn bright even this late at night.]

1008
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,396
[But...]

1009
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,177
Hello.

1010
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:14,769
[Who is Worker Yoo greeting?]

1011
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:26,258
[A crowd of 300 workers are here to give
the Running workers a warm greeting.]

1012
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:31,868
[Utter state of confusion.]

1013
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:40,274
[Speechless at the unexpected
greeting from the crowd.]

1014
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:51,658
[And the Running Workers, who are enjoying
this unexpected crowd of eager fans.]

1015
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:06,125
We were in the middle of filming

1016
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,500
and we came here because we were told
that this is the next mission site.

1017
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:10,235
But we had no idea that
so many people would be here.

1018
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:12,347
Thank you all for being here.

1019
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:17,435
[A polite bow of greeting
to the eager crowd of fans.]

1020
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,199
[The final panel of judges will be
this crowd of 300 people.]

1021
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,077
[Just what is the final promotion mission
that awaits our workers?]

1022
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:32,264
[Worker Yoo is handed a stack of cue
cards to MC the rest of the mission.]

1023
01:03:32,265 --> 01:03:36,916
Three of our members currently have
a chance at receiving a promotion.

1024
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:42,838
That would be Ha Ha, Gary,
and Lee Kwang Soo.

1025
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,902
[Only one of these three
can receive the promotion.]

1026
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,756
[The one who shows up at the office
early will win the boss' favor.]

1027
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:53,071
[Gary wins the morning commute mission
with a single minded determination.]

1028
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:56,567
[First candidate- Gary.]

1029
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,466
[Maintaining a keen eye is
crucial in the world of business.]

1030
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:01,805
[Treat the boss as you would your father-
Brown-noser, Worker Ha.]

1031
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:05,196
[Second candidate- Ha Ha.]

1032
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:08,207
[Even though I might not have a keen eye,
the contract will get signed!]

1033
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,728
[Come on, foreign buyers!
Contract signer, Worker Kwang.]

1034
01:04:10,729 --> 01:04:13,341
[Third candidate- Lee Kwang Soo.]

1035
01:04:14,168 --> 01:04:16,966
[The three candidates up for a promotion.]

1036
01:04:16,967 --> 01:04:20,553
[Just which one of these three
will receive the promotion?]

1037
01:04:21,163 --> 01:04:25,058
[But what are these 300 people
doing here?]

1038
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:29,671
But there's a term that exists
in the business world, which is 'Line'.

1039
01:04:29,672 --> 01:04:34,282
Like the namesake of this race,
one of these three will receive a promotion.

1040
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:40,394
And all of you out there will choose the one
you think will get it and get in their line.

1041
01:04:40,395 --> 01:04:42,761
[Choose one of the three candidates,
and get in their line.]

1042
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:46,105
[They have to choose the most likely
candidate and get in their line...]

1043
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:48,327
I will bet my whole
fortune on this promotion!

1044
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:55,480
Lee Kwang Soo!

1045
01:04:55,515 --> 01:04:58,445
[As any other day, Worker Kwang,
once again bets his whole fortune.]

1046
01:04:58,445 --> 01:05:03,211
This will be my fifth year of being
a regular cast member of Running Man.

1047
01:05:03,212 --> 01:05:06,332
But today has been the luckiest day
that I've had of being on this show so far.

1048
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:10,655
Do you want 2015 to be
the best year you've had so far?

1049
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:14,665
- Yes!
- Then choose me!

1050
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:19,918
Ha Dong Hoon!

1051
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:22,105
[And last but not least, Worker Gae.]

1052
01:05:22,106 --> 01:05:24,377
Make some noise!

1053
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:28,212
Make some noise!

1054
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:35,043
I hope that you choose me, and
I'll make sure that you all become winners.

1055
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:37,104
Fighting!

1056
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:42,619
Great, it's now time for the members
to make your selection.

1057
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,811
- I don't even know what this is about.
- Ji Suk Jin.

1058
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:47,508
- I'm going to think about it.
- There's no time, so make your selection.

1059
01:05:48,163 --> 01:05:53,960
Five, four, three, two, one!
Okay, Lee Kwang Soo.

1060
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:56,260
[Worker Kwang chooses
to get in Kwang Soo's line.]

1061
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:57,949
Why!

1062
01:06:02,017 --> 01:06:03,338
Okay, next.

1063
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:06,278
What about you, Song Ji Hyo?

1064
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:09,672
<i>Kang Gary!</i>

1065
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:12,735
[Monday couple]

1066
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:17,796
<i>Kang Gary!</i>

1067
01:06:17,797 --> 01:06:23,679
[Follows everyone's chanting,
and chooses Gary's line.]

1068
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,020
- I'll go with my little brother.
- Okay, Ha Ha.

1069
01:06:27,021 --> 01:06:29,790
[Worker Kkuk chooses Ha Ha's line.]

1070
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,109
Okay, I will now make my selection.

1071
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:37,026
In the history of Running Man, whenever
Gary and Ji Hyo partner up together

1072
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,072
it's rare for them not to win.

1073
01:06:39,073 --> 01:06:41,386
[Monday Couple as a team is
almost a guarantee at victory?]

1074
01:06:42,117 --> 01:06:45,230
I choose to stand with Gary and Ji Hyo!

1075
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:47,653
[Worker Yoo joins Gary's line.]

1076
01:06:47,654 --> 01:06:52,249
Okay, all the members
have now made their selection.

1077
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,517
It is time for the rest of you
to make your own selection.

1078
01:06:56,518 --> 01:07:00,936
Please move over by the team
whom you think will win the mission.

1079
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:08,186
Once the time is up, we will clearly
outline the lines of the each team.

1080
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,997
Does everyone understand?

1081
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:20,374
[The floor becomes chaotic as the crowd
moves around to make their selection.]

1082
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:36,669
Let's all countdown together.
Ten, nine, eight, seven... one!

1083
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,796
[Line selection is now complete.]

1084
01:07:37,797 --> 01:07:40,344
Happy new year!

1085
01:07:43,764 --> 01:07:46,263
I'd like to wish everyone
a happy new year in advance.

1086
01:07:46,264 --> 01:07:48,396
[Greetings for the new year
after the countdown is over.]

1087
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,096
Now it's time...

1088
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,401
[Just then, the writer comes up on
stage to hand something over.]

1089
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,562
[What could it be?]

1090
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:02,818
[Wait... that's gold!]

1091
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:06,905
- To ten people?
- To ten people?

1092
01:08:06,906 --> 01:08:09,161
[After the final mission is over, ten people
from the winning team will win the gold.]

1093
01:08:10,477 --> 01:08:12,897
[Fervently chanting on their team.]

1094
01:08:14,502 --> 01:08:18,611
[Shouting until their throats burst.]

1095
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:22,077
[The crowd fervently cheers on.]

1096
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:24,222
[The pressure builds on.]

1097
01:08:25,224 --> 01:08:27,033
Wait a minute.

1098
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,884
[Can't hear you!]

1099
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,898
If I can just tell you real quick,
this isn't all pure gold.

1100
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:35,275
Do you see this round mark over here?

1101
01:08:35,276 --> 01:08:36,749
[Only this portion is real gold.]

1102
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,749
[Hope you're not too disappointed.]

1103
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:45,898
[Time to start the final mission.]

1104
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:47,465
[Nervous energy...]

1105
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:50,445
I have been given the final mission.

1106
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:53,303
[What is their final mission?]

1107
01:08:54,854 --> 01:09:02,045
The game that you all will be participating
in for the chance at a promotion is...

1108
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:04,471
[The final battle with the chance at
a promotion hanging on the line.]

1109
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:11,957
What does life all boil down to?
Life's greatest gamble, Rock-paper-scissors!

1110
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,934
[Life's greatest gamble-
Final mission- Rock, paper, scissors.]

1111
01:09:14,935 --> 01:09:18,973
[What the heck...]

1112
01:09:18,974 --> 01:09:21,923
- That's just all about luck!
- That's no way to get a promotion!

1113
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,827
Life is all just a random gamble,
and thus, this will be the final mission.

1114
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,866
- My promotion is riding on the line.
- If you're not playing, then leave!

1115
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:29,483
I'm going to play no matter what!

1116
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:35,787
The first of the three to get three wins
will receive the promotion.

1117
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:36,913
[One point per win.
First person to win three points wins.]

1118
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:41,120
[Team Gary's line.]

1119
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:45,510
[Team Kwang's line.]

1120
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:50,706
[Team Ha's line.]

1121
01:09:51,465 --> 01:09:54,665
[Battle of the lines vs
Rock, Paper, Scissors.]

1122
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,460
Please stand back-to-back.

1123
01:09:56,461 --> 01:10:00,773
[I vow to win the battle and
gift my line with the gold.]

1124
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:09,559
- Kwang Soo, you've got this.
- What kind of a promotion is this?

1125
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,487
[No matter how they view this, this doesn't
seem like a logical way to a promotion.]

1126
01:10:12,752 --> 01:10:15,743
- What have we been doing all this?
- This is the company policy.

1127
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:20,801
- This is what it all comes down to?
- Tell me what you're thinking, Ji Hyo.

1128
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,220
She told me that she loves me.

1129
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:30,172
[Worker Gae's charming sense of humor.]

1130
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:33,320
Life is all just a random gamble,
as this mission is about to show us.

1131
01:10:33,321 --> 01:10:35,421
- Okay, get ready!
- I'm so nervous!

1132
01:10:35,422 --> 01:10:37,253
- You can do this!
- I got this!

1133
01:10:37,254 --> 01:10:40,310
[Will it be the lucky Worker Ha...]

1134
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:44,194
[Or Random Mr. Capable,
Worker Gae...]

1135
01:10:44,543 --> 01:10:47,519
[Or Worker Kwang, who's luck
may be starting to turn?]

1136
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:57,593
[A tie- They all threw out a

muttering to himself.]

01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,862
[No!]

in Lee Kwang Soo!

You all laughed when the final
mission was revealed.

1214
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:37,492
But you're now watching with your hands
clasped together in nervous energy.

1215
01:16:39,716 --> 01:16:42,904

our team shout out in joy.

01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:46,479
[Everyone on Team Kwang Soo's one wish
is to be able to shout out in joy even once.]

[Everyone on Team Kwang Soo,
I will make you all shout out in joy!]

1220
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:01,684
[Rock-paper-scissors.
Round four.]

1221
01:17:06,586 --> 01:17:12,433
[At last... we get to shout out in joy!]

1222
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:18,007
[Worker Ha will now face
a rematch with Worker Kwang.]

1223
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,468
[Worker Gary is disqualified.]

1224
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:28,927
[Shouting out Kwang Soo's name
with all their might!]

[Thank goodness!]

1226
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:37,550

if Lee Kwang Soo wins this rematch...

1227
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,940
[Come at me!]

1228
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:44,055
Please listen carefully,
if Lee Kwang Soo wins this round...

1229
01:17:44,056 --> 01:17:46,132
then he'll be able to stop Ha Ha
from winning this round.

1230
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:50,676
And as he himself said earlier,
he will change the course of this game.

1231
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:57,706
But if Kwang Soo loses this round,
then Ha Ha wins the whole mission.

1232
01:17:58,753 --> 01:18:04,450
Right at this moment, even Gary and Ji Hyo
must cheer Kwang Soo on for their own sake.

1233
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:06,913
Kwang Soo, you don't want Ha Ha
to win, do you?

1234
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:10,184
Our team will swap out our cheer.
We'll now cheer out, 'Let's go home.'

1235

on this round of rock-paper-scissors.]

let's remain strong.]

1258
