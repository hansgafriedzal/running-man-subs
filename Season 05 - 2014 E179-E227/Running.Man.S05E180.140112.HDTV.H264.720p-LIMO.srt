12
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,289
<i>A name for your dish?</i>

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,858

rockfish stew and sweet and sour rockfish?

Soo Hong...
I can put all my faith in you, right?

32
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:22,735
Just put your faith in me, and trust me.

33
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,301

37
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,959
[Jae Suk is shocked to see who
Jong Kook's partner is.]

38
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,800
You look so short next to Kyung Ah.

39
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,192
- You look totally short.
- You think I'm the only one?

40
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,950
- Try standing next to her yourself.
- Wow, she's so tall.

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,607
[Certified 'Chef' is already busy prepping
in the midst of all this.]

42
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,842

- Hello!
- Hey, Sung Kyu!

44
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,706

I saw you clubbing with all the
younger guys the other night.

46
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,535
Did I look cool?

47
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:21,001
[Happy because he may have looked
cool amongst all the younger guys?]

48
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,827
- Are you a pretty good cook, Sung Kyu?
- I've been living on my own since I was 20.

49
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,884
So I've been cooking for myself
for almost five years now.

50
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:31,720
I had a brief glimpse at his cooking skills,
and the way he handles his knife is no joke.

51
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,705
- Someone else is here.
- Right in here.

52
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,595
It's Dong Wook!

[Who could Big-nose's mysterious partner be?]

56
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,536
[It's Kyung Ho, the homemaker.]

57
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:58,170
- Where have you two been?
- We went and got some teot and oysters.

58
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,331
[This team went all the way to the seaside to
get fresh teot and oysters.]

59
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,038
- There they are.
- Who is it?

60
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:10,492
[Kwang Soo, John Park and Gary and Jae Kyung
are the last two teams to arrive.]

61
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:15,122
[Thus all the experts in each field of
expertise have now gathered in one spot.]

62
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,729
- It's the clubber brother.
- Why is he the clubber brother?

63
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,446
[The two infamous clubbers are
giving each other a high five.]

64
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:24,077
[Awkward seeing each other in
a brightly lit place...]

65
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,212
<i>You all know what
the final mission is all about.</i>

66

<i>You will be utilizing the menu items and
cooking techniques you've gathered yourselves</i>

68
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:42,649
<i>to cook your own special dishes that could be
served on the first weekend dinner table.</i>

69
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,091
<i>You will have exactly 100 minutes
to complete cooking your dish.</i>

70
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:49,188
<i>We will stop the time exactly at
100 minutes.</i>

71
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,109
<i>We will stop the clock exactly at that time.</i>

72
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:53,129
<i>And in order to ensure a fair judging...</i>

73
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,937
<i>We will now welcome a panel of judges
that we have very carefully selected.</i>

74
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,560
[Time for the panel of judges
to make their entrance.]

75
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,133
- They're coming out already?
- I wonder who they could be?

76
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,034
- Welcome your panel of judges.
- I wonder who they are.

77
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:07,300
[Who could they be?]

78
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,568
[Celebrity Chef- Raymond Kim.]

79
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,781
[Shocked at the appearance
of a top celebrity chef.]

80
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:30,533
[Expert in traditional Korean cooking-
Shim Young Soon.]

81
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,279
It's Shim Young Soon.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,828
[Webtoon author- Jung Da Jung.]

83
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:54,627
[Made her debut and a huge success
with a webtoon focused on cooking.]

84
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:58,437
[Amazed]

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,929
[Chocolatier Louis Kang.]

86
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,452
I can't believe that they're all here!

87
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:16,052
[All the top experts in Korea have gathered!]

88
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,651
How are we ever to live up
to their expectations?

89
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:21,280
[Their level of nervousness is heightened
by the appearance of such experts.]

90
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,060
We're not good enough to have
a panel of judges like this.

91
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:26,262
- This is no joke.
- No, this is no joke.

92
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:28,170
[Today's competition is no joke!]

93
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,028
Selection of your ingredients,
your cooking process

94
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:38,793
and how unique you are with how you
cook up your dish and present it

95
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,637
will determine how I judge you today.

96
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,766
- Yes, I understand.
- She's so well spoken.

97
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,046
[Automatic respect mode.]

98
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:51,357
Since none of you are professional
chefs here

99
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:54,239
I'm going to be basing my judging
on how much fun you have while cooking.

100
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,316
If you do it like that...
I don't think it'll work out too well for you.

101
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:10,195
- I think that's going overboard.
- You have to have respect for the food.

102
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,754
I don't think they know Raymond Kim.
I remained very quiet during the whole thing.

103
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:19,383
Since I'm not a professional chef myself

104
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,441
I think I'm going to focus on
how much fun you have

105
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,560
and how clean you keep everything
during the competition.

106
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,353
As everyone else has already said...

107
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,609
I'm going to be judging to see
how much care you put into your cooking.

108
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,337
He has such a nice voice.

109
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,596
[Is Jae Kyung's plan to suck up to him?]

110
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:41,767
And how well you present your dishes,
and the look of your end results

111
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:44,185
such as color and
the presentation of the dish.

112
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,191
- Are you married?
- No.

113
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:51,772
[Queen of flattery chiming in
at every chance that she gets.]

114
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:54,838
- Jae Kyung is trying to butter him up.
- What is she doing?

115
00:07:56,856 --> 00:08:00,816
<i>If any of you have anything to ask the judges,
then now is your only chance to do so.</i>

116
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:04,361
In that case...
would it be okay if I called you 'Mother'?

117
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,063
[Chastised for his comment.]

118
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:13,629
What's wrong with what I just said?
Her sweet smile was just so maternal.

119
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:16,557
Sis... do you remember me?

120
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,942
She doesn't go clubbing like you do.

121
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:26,007
- We just want to get closer to her.
- We've done a show together before.

122
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,320
Whether you call me 'mother', or 'sis'...

123
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:32,218
It's not going to have any effect
on my judging.

124
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:39,371
[Extremely fair and just panel of judges.]

125
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,614
Kwang Soo says he wants to ask
Sis Da Jung a question.

126
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:44,552
- Sis Da Jung?
- She looks much younger than you.

127
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:46,957
- I was born in '85.
- I was born in '91.

128
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,850
[He's calling a woman who's six years
younger than him an 'older sister'?]

129
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,948
[A mistake that he can't take back...]

130
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,366
How could he have said that to her when
she looks young enough to be a student?

131
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:01,997
- What's your ideal type?
- My ideal type?

132
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:03,765
You're not it, Kwang Soo.

133
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:13,681
She really told you on that one.

134
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,295
I have something I'd like to ask.

135
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:18,886
What's the criteria on how you judge
the presentation of the dish?

136
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:20,695
That's a very good question.

137
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,811
As far as how the presentation goes...

138
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,740
I think I'd be okay with it as long as there's
a good explanation for your presentation.

139
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,379
Even if it's not presented in the best way

140
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,736
if you have a reason for presenting it a
certain way, such as the order of dish to eat.

141
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,308
What is your opinion on being
a little extravagant with the presentation?

142
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,900
I oppose anything that's
inedible being presented.

143
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,079
[Opposed to anything inedible...]

144
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,360
[I guess they have something
extravagant on their minds?]

145
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,266
<i>Then the panel of judges may
take their place.</i>

146
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,776
- Thank you and take good care of us.
- Thank you.

147
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:52,080
[And we will see the panel of judges
in a little bit!]

148
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:56,992
- You will have exactly 100 minutes.
- We understand.

149
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,886
- Let's all play a fair and honest game.
- Yes, I agree.

150
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,184
Don't pull out a secret sauce and ingredient
and try to sneak that into your dish.

151
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:07,250
[No use of any premade mixes, broths,
or spices of any kind.]

152
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,761
- No secret ingredients.
- Don't use any noodle spices.

153
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:13,255
- Let's all play fairly.
- Ready, set, go!

154
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:17,626
[Cooking competition- Start.]

155
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:28,327
[Whose dish will take the honorary place
as the winning dish of this competition?]

156
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:32,556
To be honest...
I'm a really horrible cook.

157
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,689
That's why I went into this
without any expectations

158
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,092
when I heard it was a cooking competition.

159
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:40,855
And since all the other teams are using
such fancy ingredients for their dishes

160
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:46,082
and since our ingredients are so simple,
I really don't have any high expectations.

161
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,658
I can't really guarantee how it'll taste

162
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,679
but I can vouch for the care we'll put into it
with the freshest of ingredients.

163
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,435
My partner and I vow to win
this competition

164
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:04,165
and show you how sincere we are about
starting off 2014, the new year the right way.

165
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,581
Fighting!

166
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Yes, I'm confident.
I know that other teams are really good too

167
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,319
but even just from a quick glance

168
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,417
I can't help but think that our
ingredient is most superior of them all.

169
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:17,059
It's also the perfect season for it,
so I'm pretty confident that we'll win.

170
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,075
That sounds great.
Then we wish you the best of luck.

171
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,454
[Who will become the winner to take home
this golden horse trophy?]

172
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,150
Hey!
Let's do this!

173
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,538
[It's time for the real competition to begin!]

174
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,114
[All the teams shouting out their own
special battle cry to win the competition.]

175
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,453
- He looks like a girl.
- What?

176
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:43,779
- He looks like a girl.
- Right? Doesn't he look like a girl?

177
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:52,665
[The apron looks so well suited...
for the domesticated rocker.]

178
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,927
- This is war!
- This is real war!

179
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,213
You're all going to be shocked!

180
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,344
- The victory...
- Is ours!

181
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,600
This is amazing!

182
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:06,722
I can smell the deliciousness
of our dish already!

183
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,910
A clubber in his mid-forties...

184
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,280
He's going to shock all of you
with his cooking skills!

185
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:14,550
- Knock it off!
- My partner is a domesticated rocker!

186
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,078
We're going to win this thing!

187
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,114
- If we don't win today...
- I'm going to be angry!

188
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,989
- Let's win this thing!
- Be quiet!

189
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:30,316
[We knew you'd get in trouble...]

190
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,374
Can you stop with all the talking?

191
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,026
Let's use this as the trash can, okay?

192
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,693
[Today's chef- Soo Hong.
Kitchen assistant- Yoo Hyuk.]

193
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,911
- You're really fast.
- Of course, I am.

194
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,255
[Assistant Yoo getting praised
for his quick work.]

195
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,917
[Assistant Yoo is in charge of
washing all the vegetables.]

196
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,741
Jae Suk is a really fast worker.

197
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:02,463
He washed and organized everything,
and helped when I asked him for his help.

198
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,793
I don't think I could've done what I did today
if it hadn't been for Jae Suk's help.

199
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,839
I wish that I could use him as
my assistant for life.

200
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,541
- You know what, Soo Hong?
- What?

201
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,632
Don't worry too much since I'm going to do
my best to be a good assistant today.

202
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,082
You're doing a great job.

203
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:19,887
[Wait... that is?]

204
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:26,244
[His own personal knives that have
his name engraved on them?]

205
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:29,637
Hey! Soo Hong just
pulled out his personal knives!

206
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,353
- What?
- He has his own personal knives?

207
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:35,795
[Protests from other teams
could be heard from all around the room.]

208
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,714
Had I known we could do that,
I would've brought my own knives too.

209
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,572
Who in this world doesn't have
their own kitchen knives?

210
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:43,041
[Too much envy can become
your demise...]

211
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,095
[This is the power of a certified chef!]

212
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:54,239
[Clean and precise-
Impressive knife skills.]

213
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:03,472
Talking to each other while cooking will
help us be more in sync with one another.

214
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:06,547
So then why aren't you talking?
I'm the one doing all the talking over here.

215
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,651
- Right? I'm not being talkative enough.
- Yeah.

216
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:11,267
- It's because I'm feeling the pressure.
- Can I put the bean sprouts here?

217
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,881
[Chef Hong is feeling
the pressure in the kitchen.]

218
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,931
This completes all the prepping
for our spicy fish stew.

219
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:23,393
[Jae Suk and Soo Hong's dish
is a spicy fish stew?]

220
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:27,213
We went out fishing earlier and Soo Hong
caught the rockfish we'll be using himself.

221
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:30,521
Not just any rockfish either,
but a 50cm rockfish.

222
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,687
It's a giant-sized rockfish.

223
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,881
Let me catch just one fish.
Please, just one fish.

224
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,005
[Earlier this morning on a fishing boat.]

225
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,499
Oh!
I think I got something.

226
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,780
I got something!

227
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:40,553
Wow, I got something!

228
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:44,046
[Soo Hong catches his first fish
within first 20 minutes!]

229
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,420
I got something!
Wow!

230
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:54,067
[It's a fish!]

231
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,935
Jae Suk!

232
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:59,854
I can't believe this!

233
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,308
- I can't believe this!
- He caught a fish!

234
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,135
[A huge fish!]

235
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,685
I'm totally shocked myself!

236
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,353
[And not too long after...]

237
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,604
[Another fish!]

238
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:17,985
It's even bigger!

239
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:21,292
[It's an even bigger rockfish!
A 50cm catch!]

240
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:25,035
[And thus, with the rockfish that
Soo Hong caught himself...]

241
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:28,745
[What kind of a dish will they cook up?]

242
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:31,923
A nice and refreshing rockfish stew
that the whole family can enjoy.

243
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:35,757
And also, a savory
sweet and sour rockfish.

244
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:39,559
I see those two dishes as a
heavenly pair.

245
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:46,284
[Chef Hong is busy cleaning the rockfish
that he himself caught earlier.]

246
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:51,071
I have to make sure that all the insides
are really clean.

247
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,405
[Even manages to make a simple
work out of cleaning the fish.]

248
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:54,433
There's no way I can do this.

249
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,183
I don't think I could do this even if
my life depended on it.

250
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:59,348
I can't even watch you do this.
I'm going to go wait outside.

251
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:03,048
- Do you like your partner?
- Park Soo Hong?

252
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,723
Yes, I do like him.

253
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:09,491
And especially when it comes to cooking,
Soo Hong is very detail-oriented.

254
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,586
- He's very good at what he does.
- If you could change your partner...

255
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:14,304
- Who would you pick?
- Jae Kyung.

256
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:19,705
- Is that king crab?
- This is our king crab.

257
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,559
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook's main ingredient is,
king crab.]

258
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,570
What is that?

259
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:27,265
Wow... this is pretty much cheating.

260
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,778
We went all the way to Pohang
to get this ourselves.

261
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,280
[These king crabs are delicious enough
even if they're just steamed...]

262
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:36,552
[Earlier this morning-
King crab auction market in Pohang.]

263
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,745
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook participating
in the king crab auction.]

264
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,667
[Blank Ji wins the auction.]

265
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:52,190
[But...]

266
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:56,359
[The problem is, she bought all 800 crabs!]

267
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,856
I can't eat all these!

268
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,846
We're planning on making

269
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:08,983
steamed king crabs, king crab porridge,
and king crab stew.

270
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,588
We even came up with a name for our menu.
King crab...

271
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,062
King crab...

272
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:16,570
A king crab delicious dinner table.

273
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,232
[Steamed king crabs-
Steam the crabs for 25 minutes.]

274
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,920
We went out to Ji Hyo's hometown
in Pohang.

275
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,902
That's a pretty famous place in our country
for its sunrise.

276
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:42,102
That's the place where a lot of people gather
to greet the first sunrise of the new year.

277
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,921
King crabs with the energy of that place,
and something that's in season right now...

278
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:49,339
Since we were able to get those crabs,
which are also of such high quality...

279
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,269
We thought that it would be the most ideal
thing to serve on a dinner table.

280
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,127
I bet this would be good
even if we just ate it raw right now.

281
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:00,052
- It's really good raw too.
- It's really sweet.

282
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:03,101
[These fresh king crabs are sweet
even when eaten raw.]

283
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:08,136
[Dong Wook gets his finger
pinched in the claw.]

284
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,140
I'm sorry, but just let go of me.

285
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,136
[Wow... enough to make our mouths water.]

286
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,458
I just want to eat it now.

287
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,804
[Are the viewers' mouths watering too?]

288
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,113
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook complete prepping
all the ingredients for their dishes.]

289
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,848
Wow, theirs is chicken.
Their ingredient really is chicken.

290
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,420
It's chicken!
And it still has its head attached!

291
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,792
Can you really prep that chicken?

292
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,436
- Yes.
- Of course. We have to.

293
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,525
- You're making the broth, right?
- Yes.

294
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,289
[Meanwhile, Kyung Ah is prepping the broth
which they're going to cook the chicken in.]

295
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,490
I kind of thought that the dish
may be a little too ordinary at first.

296
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,074
But we couldn't think of any other dish.

297
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,963
This is supposed to be first dinner
of the new year with the family.

298
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:06,053
And what does a new year mean?
It's time to be healthy.

299
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:08,367
It's not money, but it's health.

300
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,739
I thought something healthy
would be the most important thing.

301
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,918
So I think that this is the perfect menu
for a theme like that.

302
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,355
[Earlier this morning-
Chicken farm in Namyang.]

303
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:24,549
[Off to catch their chicken at a farm
recommended to them by the chicken doctor.]

304
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,443
- It just hit me.
- Catch it.

305
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:32,515
Don't you think that you're too good
at catching the chicken?

306
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:36,591
[Fearless Kyung Ah catches her chicken
within moments.]

307
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,143
[They also went to pay a visit to a master of
chicken stew that chicken doctor recommended.]

308
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:46,030
I've heard that chickens have
a lot of fat in the rear.

309
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,430
I was told that we have to clean it out
very carefully, so how do we do that?

310
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:54,362
The most important part is right here.

311
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:59,649
You have to make sure to really clean out
the neck and the rear part of the chicken.

312
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:04,192
- You can just cut all these parts off.
- Okay, those parts?

313
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,633
We can take pictures of all this
to help us remember.

314
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,986
[Kyung Ah asks the questions,
and Jong Kook takes the pictures.]

315
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,426
- Good idea, right?
- Yes, it's good.

316
00:20:14,386 --> 00:20:15,965
We have to take pictures of all this.

317
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,174
Look at this.
See how the rear is all cut like this?

318
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,391
[Confirming with pictures.]

319
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,297
- I'm going to put this in right now.
- Okay.

320
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,238
You're putting that in already?

321
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:28,026
Yes, so that we can cook off
all the odor from the chicken first.

322
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,740
[Boil it in a pot of boiling water with garlic
and ginger first to eliminate the odor.]

323
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:39,244
[They even stopped by the market earlier to
buy their abalone and octopus for the stew.]

324
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:42,163
Clean it until all the black stuff is off.

325
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:55,470
[Put the once boiled chicken into a
pressure cooker with rest of the ingredients.]

326
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:59,371
We can tell them what we're putting
in the pot later, but not now.

327
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:02,706
[Ginseng, mushrooms, tree barks, jujube,
and astragulus also go into the pot.]

328
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:10,564
Is this all set then?
I just have to shut the lid like this?

329
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,978
- Should the thing be standing up?
- Yes, stand it up.

330
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,090
- Like this, right?
- Yes.

331
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:16,425
- Right?
- Yes.

332
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,107
- We're all set then, right?
- Yes.

333
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,470
- High flames?
- Yes.

334
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,449
What should I do now?

335
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,800
[His chatter won't stop even during cooking.]

336
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,076
Seriously!
You ask way too many questions!

337
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:32,430
I'm asking because I don't know.

338
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:38,880
I had no idea that Jong Kook
talked so much.

339
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:43,569
I had absolutely no idea.
He's built like a mountain...

340
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,090
but he's so full of suspicions
about everything.

341
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:49,753
And he's timid on top off all that.
Asking me all those nonstop questions.

342
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:51,929
I thought I was going to blow up at him!

343
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,076
Is the dish you're cooking causing
troubles with your partner?

344
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:58,890
Yes, very much so.
Here's how I feel about it.

345
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:01,201
We did have quite a few
difference of opinions.

346
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:05,788
I know that she's a much better cook than I am
so I decided to put my faith in her.

347
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:09,215
So I just did as I was told by her, and
didn't make any comments about anything.

348
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:11,234
No, let me take that back.
I did make a comment or two.

349
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:15,102
I did make a lot of comments.
But in the end...

350
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:19,289
- How well would you say you cook together?
- I don't think you can even say that.

351
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,034
I pretty much did all the work myself.

352
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:26,773
But when I struggled from time to time,
Jong Kook gave me a lot of support.

353
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:28,772
He told me how good I'm doing.

354
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:32,859
I think his faith in me
was what kept me going.

355
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:35,679
Carefully and with love.

356
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,547
[Carefully wash the rice...]

357
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:42,130
I have never put so much effort into
cooking in my life before.

358
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm going to soak the rice in the broth.

359
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,943
[Soak the rice in broth?]

360
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,913
[Soak the rice in milky colored broth
instead of plain water?]

361
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,075
Take good care of us, broth from Jeonju!

362
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:57,826
[The fate of Ha Ha and Sung Kyu
rides in this pit of rice...]

363
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,649
- This is beef bone broth, isn't it?
- You cook it with beef bone broth?

364
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,776
Yes, this is how the rice used to get made
back in the day.

365
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,052
- Rice cooked in this broth alone is amazing.
- It's really good.

366
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:17,921
[Authentic Jeonju bibimbap is made by soaking
the rice in beef bone broth first.]

367
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,710
All our beloved viewers and our staff members
who makes Running Man possible...

368
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:28,989
All these people, and even our own members
are who I had in mind as I was making this.

369
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,047
I felt like they all were part of this dish.
Viewers were the rice, staff crew was doraji.

370
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,712
The mushroom... represented Ji Hyo.

371
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:41,272
The carrots represented myself,
and the cucumber was Suk Jin.

372
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:45,936
I thought that's how the ingredients were
blended together harmoniously like we are.

373
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:49,945
So this is... everyone's bibimbap.

374
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,828
- Do you think this is enough carrots?
- Yes, that's plenty.

375
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,005
Didn't she put something in here
when she was panfrying this?

376
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:04,352
Zucchini is cooked in cooking oil only,
and the rest are cooked in sesame oil.

377
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,507
Let's have fun with this, Sung Kyu.

378
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:19,371
[Putting all their love and care
into each and every bit of the dish.]

379
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,673
The way you have it plated is so pretty.

380
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,492
[It seems as though the rice is almost
finished cooking already.]

381
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,199
I turned it off.

382
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,109
Should I open it to take a peek?
I know it still needs to finish steaming.

383
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,191
We're finished if the rice is ruined.

384
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:47,012
- It's a success!
- It's not a success!

385
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:49,817
- The rice has to be a bit chewy in bibimbap.
- That's right.

386
00:24:49,818 --> 00:24:51,486
The rice can't be soggy.

387
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:54,115
Until it becomes transparent.
Keep cooking until the doraji is transparent.

388
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,877
I'm the king of cooking.

389
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,177
Are we sure that the rice cooked well?

390
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:03,970
We're cooking a dish that's really
good for your stamina.

391
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:07,806
That's why we're using fresh sea eel
right out of the ocean.

392
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,828
[Freshly caught that morning by
a local sea diver.]

393
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,683
[Fresh sea eel!]

394
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:17,506
Look at this eel.
Is this really a sea eel?

395
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:22,127
A true taste of Korean cuisine.

396
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:25,598
So we're cooking stir-fried eel soup.

397
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,502
And we're also preparing spicy red pepper,
and soybean paste teot muchim.

398
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:37,623
- Let's do this right, okay?
- You're much better than I am at that.

399
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,306
- You're so relaxed about it, and you're good.
- Not bad, right?

400
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,799
- You cut that up perfectly.
- Right?

401
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,340
[Big-nose and the Domesticated Rocker's dish-
How will it turn out?]

402
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,930
- Jae Kyung.
- Yes?

403
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,212
- I'm nervous.
- You'll do well because you're handsome.

404
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:59,301
- My mind has gone completely blank.
- Already?

405
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,809
- I'm not sure what I'm doing.
- What you're doing is perfect.

406
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,103
- It's perfect?
- It's perfect.

407
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,820
Gary looks like he's still having fun
even if he doesn't win this competition.

408
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:10,351
- Cooking is all about love.
- Seriously.

409
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,982
Sanjeok... that's all about love.

410
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,003
Why are you laughing!

411
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:21,052
Why are you all laughing?
Sanjeok is all about love, everyone.

412
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:26,077
Combination of their infamous beef,
and the naju pear.

413
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:31,901
We'll be serving that up with a pear tea,
and a special dessert made of the pears.

414
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,379
Year 2014...

415
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:41,693
In the new year... Korea, the world,
you and I... we all have to become one.

416
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,492
In order to unify all of us as one...

417
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:47,204
we all need to eat sanjeok.

418
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,154
Because sanjeok is...

419
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,278
love.

420
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,538
[This is sanjeok of love that will
unify the whole world as one.]

421
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:05,251
[Following orders...
exactly as given to him by Jae Kyung.]

422
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,892
Look at how good Jae Kyung is
with that knife.

423
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:15,784
[Jae Kyung's natural knife skills,
all thanks to her chef mother...]

424
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,894
[If you could switch up for a new partner,
then who would you pick?]

425
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:21,573
I don't want to say this because I don't
want anyone to misunderstand my meaning.

426
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:25,583
I really don't have the slightest desire
to switch... but, Jae Kyung.

427
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,065
I noticed that she's a really good cook.

428
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,730
Aside from everything else,
she was really good at what she was doing.

429
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,116
I was totally shocked when I saw that.

430
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:37,160
[These are the knife skills
that Ha Ha totally fell for.]

431
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,625
A part of me really wishes that
I had been paired up with Jae Kyung.

432
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,850
[Even Big-nose is talking about his wish
to have been partnered up with Jae Kyung.]

433
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:50,448
- You want me to dump the onions in here?
- Yes, just add the onions in there.

434
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:54,800
Let's look at the amount and see how much
of the pear and the onion we should add.

435
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:59,429
- You don't want to add the ginger?
- No ginger yet.

436
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,087
[Following the recipe exactly as she had
written down while they were in Naju.]

437
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,271
- Two.
- Two.

438
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,305
Who would you want as your partner
if you could switch?

439
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,678
Jae Kyung.

440
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:18,697
- Why?
- Huh? I just want Jae Kyung.

441
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,388
- That's your reason?
- What reason would I need? It's Jae Kyung.

442
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:24,862
Who else is there?
There's only Jae Kyung.

443
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:29,687
Which team would you say has
absolutely zero chance of winning?

444
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,889
From what I've seen so far...

445
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,205
I would say that's Kwang Soo's team.

446
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,839
I don't think they have a chance.

447
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,465
Why did you team those two up together?

448
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,888
I feel so bad watching those two
struggling together.

449
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,114
I'm not very worried about Kwang Soo's team.

450
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:44,138
- Kwang Soo's team.
- Kwang Soo.

451
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,387
- That would be Team Kwang Soo.
- I'm sorry to say that Kwang Soo's team...

452
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,201
I'm having trouble with the dough.

453
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,031
I was able to make it earlier.

454
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,235
[Oh my...]

455
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:11,001
[What happened?
Even the expert gave you a compliment...]

456
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,944
I think you should be in charge
of making the dough.

457
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,021
[Could it be that he's nervous?
The dough is just a mess...]

458
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:23,491
[Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is busy making
the sauce for the noodle.]

459
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:25,059
Do you think this is enough of
the grated pear?

460
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,488
[The special spicy noodle sauce
with the pear zest.]

461
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,489
- Just a little bit.
- Okay.

462
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,773
- I think that's going to make it too sweet.
- There's a lot of the sauce.

463
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,541
There's a lot of the spicy sauce.

464
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,437
[Huh?]

465
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:39,465
[Is that patbingsoo?]

466
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:45,609
[These two guys- They weren't
such a mess in the beginning...]

467
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,386
[Their visit to Chuncheon to learn the real
secret behind a delicious bowl of noodles.]

468
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:55,664
[Learned the secret behind making
a special bowl of noodles.]

469
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,381
Wrap the noodles around your fingers.

470
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,519
What is this?
Dongchimi?

471
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:09,939
How am I supposed to eat this?
Just like it is?

472
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,983
Ah, add it to the dongchimi?

473
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:15,153
- Do I add in the broth?
- Yes, add in the broth.

474
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,650
[Succeeds in getting the dongchimi broth
which is crucial to their chance of winning.]

475
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:28,929
[This is what real pork is all about!]

476
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,375
[Even gained the real secret behind the real
broth and the pork for their noodle dish.]

477
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,085
Can you give us some?

478
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,361
[They even earned themselves some
of her top secret topping sauce.]

479
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:50,311
[Even after learning all the secrets,
and gathering all the secret ingredients...]

480
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:54,019
[these are the guys responsible
for putting it all together.]

481
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,812
What's that?
What's wrong with the dough?

482
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,561
I'm doing the best that I can.

483
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:01,732
- Don't you think you need to add more water?
- You think?

484
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,111
A little bit more?

485
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,789
It's the end for us if we ruin the dough.

486
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,413
I know that too.

487
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:12,696
[Is it dough or clay?]

488
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:18,032
- It's been 25 minutes now.
- Already?

489
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:21,621
[Kwang Soo and John Park have spent
the past 25 minutes making their dough.]

490
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,738
We have to hurry!
We don't have time to be doing this!

491
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,914
- Move away!
- Let me do this!

492
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:28,622
- We're not going to win at this rate!
- I can finish this!

493
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,785
Is laughter what those two
are aiming for?

494
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:40,589
Is that what you have those two for?
They have no idea what they're doing.

495
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,211
I feel so bad watching those two work.

496
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:46,030
Even though I know they're trying...
I can't help but feel sorry for them.

497
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:50,523
[This is the type of empathetic stares
they're getting from other teams.]

498
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:51,823
Hey guys.

499
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:55,058
You guys should take some time to eat
while you two work.

500
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,631
Why would we be taking the time out to eat?

501
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,940
- I just feel so bad for you guys.
- Why?

502
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:03,280
And don't have your mouths gaped open
like that while you're cooking.

503
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,386
Did I already add in the sesame seeds?

504
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,678
I forgot to add the sesame seeds!

505
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,699
No, he did add it in.
Okay, whew!

506
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,853
[It seems as though Sung Kyu already
added in the sesame seeds.]

507
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,291
You saute the mushrooms separately
without any cooking oil.

508
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,222
- You have to saute that.
- We have to saute this?

509
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:31,633
Yes, we need to saute it.

510
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,640
- We have to saute this too?
- You're not going to saute it?

511
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,366
- Did I already saute it?
- You didn't saute it?

512
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,672
[Both of them seem to have an
awful memory.]

513
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,820
- We could've been in big trouble.
- That's why we don't add the cooking oil.

514
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,542
Thank goodness for you.

515
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:47,704
[Luckily remembers to saute the mushrooms.]

516
00:32:50,286 --> 00:32:53,327
[Tasting the vegetables
to test for the seasoning.]

517
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,172
Jong Kook is angry.
Jong Kook is angry!

518
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:04,717
[Sautes it one more time...]

519
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:13,063
[How does the sauteed
seasoned mushrooms taste?]

520
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:20,263
[Tastes extremely salty...]

521
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:24,431
Ugh, that's salty.
No way.

522
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:28,064
[They did as they were taught...
but can't figure out the mushroom mystery...]

523
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:30,623
The way I see it right now,
I think our dish is going to be delicious.

524
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,482
[Jae Suk and Soo Hong are busy
preparing their rockfish.]

525
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:37,977
Look at that fish.

526
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:41,951
- I think this is all ready.
- Don't you think we need to soak it more?

527
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,669
[Sweet and sour rockfish-
Baste it with curry powder.]

528
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:55,055
[A light sprinkling of curry powder before
frying it eliminates the fishy odor.]

529
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,056
Just sprinkle it with however much
you want.

530
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,484
[Jae Suk is infamous for his inability to
touch raw fish...]

531
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,513
- You startled me.
- The fish just snapped its mouth.

532
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:28,134
- What are you doing?
- It just moved its tail.

533
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:33,044
Stop going clubbing so much.
Even the fish is flipping its tail!

534
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,592
What are you talking about?
What does my clubbing have to do with this?

535
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:38,098
You're being absurd right now!

536
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,683
[Did the fish knowingly flip its tail
in front of the 40 year old clubber?]

537
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:44,683
- I'm telling you that it moved its tail.
- Why are you so scared of a dead fish?

538
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,281
Wow, that scared me to death.

539
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:54,285
[Coating it with the frying batter.]

540
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:57,908
That's good.

541
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:02,188
Is the oil hot enough?

542
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,329
- Is it not hot enough yet?
- No.

543
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,797
See? The batter is sinking to the bottom.
It needs to float right up to the top.

544
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:13,098
[The batter has to float immediately to
the top in order for it to be the right temp.]

545
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,541
Wow, you really are a cooking expert.

546
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:21,101
[Making sure there's plenty of
the frying batter on the fish...]

547
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:26,422
Try some.
Is the batter floating to the top?

548
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:29,131
Is it floating back to the top?
Okay, then that's hot enough.

549
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:31,092
- Do you want me to put it in?
- Yeah, put the fish in there.

550
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,812
[Time to start frying the rockfish!]

551
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:42,832
[Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Dong Wook's
steamed king crabs are...]

552
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:48,739
[Even just the sight of them is enough
to make our mouths water.]

553
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:54,532
Should I start the soup broth first,
or make the rice first?

554
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,478
- Start the soup first, right?
- Yes, the soup.

555
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,973
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook's crab stew-
They've already learned the secrets.]

556
00:36:05,754 --> 00:36:09,836
[King crab stew that Blank Ji's older cousin
taught them earlier.]

557
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:16,026
Try it, Dong Wook.
It's so delicious.

558
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:18,660
It's so good.

559
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:21,686
It still needs to simmer a bit more.

560
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:24,632
Isn't it good?
Doesn't it go well with the porridge?

561
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,292
We're going to win this.

562
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,162
The broth is just so refreshing.
This would be perfect with a drink.

563
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:35,401
[Using the right soybean paste
is the real key to a great stew!]

564
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:40,814
- We need to take some back with us.
- We need to take this.

565
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:44,071
- This is my family's recipe.
- This is our secret recipe.

566
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:46,281
This is going to be our secret sauce.

567
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:52,051
[The secret to the stew...
the soybean paste is going in!]

568
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:59,261
- How's it going?
- I lowered the heat a little bit.

569
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:03,241
- Did you add the garlic?
- No, I'm about to do that now.

570
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:05,227
[Add the crab when
the seasoning is just right.]

571
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,152
- It's okay, this is going to be delicious.
- I think we added too much of the paste.

572
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:09,603
[Enough to make our mouths water.]

573
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,804
- We have to add the pepper, right?
- Yes.

574
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:14,478
[Add in all the vegetables,
and bring it to a roaring boil.]

575
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,590
We have to bring it to a boil first.

576
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:22,672
[Jong Kook and Kyung Ah are making fresh
kimchi to accompany their chicken stew.]

577
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:32,074
[Infuse the kimchi with sweetness by
adding in ripe persimmon.]

578
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:37,223
[These two are still
wrestling with their dough.]

579
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,150
We're finished if we don't
get the noodles right.

580
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:42,177
Are you finished prepping everything else?

581
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,253
I'm doing my best right now.

582
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:48,717
[Not allowed to change
their menu at this point!]

583
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:59,786
[John Park... Putting every ounce of
his energy into the dough!]

584
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:05,522
[The dough is finally starting to take
its shape thanks to all his hard work.]

585
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,596
[Looking good!]

586
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:10,669
You look like a real chef.

587
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:13,038
Your really do look like a real chef.

588
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:20,925
[Time to cut the rolled out dough
into noodle strands.]

589
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:28,128
- Try this sauce and see how it tastes.
- I don't think this is a good noodle.

590
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,787
I think I rolled it out too thin.

591
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,689
I think it's too thin.

592
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,104
[The noodle is too thin
and not doughy enough.]

593
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,634
Do you think that it needs more water?

594
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:42,092
I'll redo it real quick.

595
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:43,844
- Okay.
- I know I can do it.

596
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:50,758
[The four members of the judging panel
come around to take a look!]

597
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:53,043
She's here.
I see her walking around.

598
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,752
She's coming.

599
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:57,661
I have a question for you, Mrs. Shim.

600
00:38:58,354 --> 00:39:01,652
There's something that
I'm a little unclear on.

601
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,738
What's the difference between
thick soy sauce and soup soy sauce?

602
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:06,700
I'm not sure of the difference.

603
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:11,280
Soup soy sauce is naturally brewed
and fermented.

604
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:14,549
The beans are naturally fermented
to turn it into the soy sauce form.

605
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,842
I can't believe how much fun
I'm having.

606
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,020
[Going overboard with his pretenses about
having fun with the judges around.]

607
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:26,832
- Hello.
- Hello.

608
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,865
I never knew just how much fun
cooking could really be.

609
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:31,733
I think you're spitting on your food.

610
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:38,069
- What is this?
- I'm boiling some bean sprouts.

611
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,463
I'm boiling some sprouts to be used for
the bean sprout soup and the bibimbap.

612
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,993
Boiling it for too long
will make it too chewy.

613
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:46,489
Yes, I understand!

614
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,261
We should stop boiling it now.

615
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:51,816
[Listening to her advice and
pulls it out of the pot immediately.]

616
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,642
- This is our rockfish.
- We caught it ourselves this morning.

617
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,884
I'm grating the onion myself right now
to add it to our sauce.

618
00:39:57,885 --> 00:40:02,385
- This was caught fresh this morning.
- Why are you standing over here?

619
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:04,840
- I'm here to talk to the judges real quick.
- Go back to having fun with your cooking.

620
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,928
Yes, I will.

621
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,388
Kwang Soo.

622
00:40:10,736 --> 00:40:14,402
We heard of the famous noodle shops in
Chuncheon known for their amazing noodles.

623
00:40:14,403 --> 00:40:17,646
We went to all three of them to learn
of their secrets behind their noodles

624
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,632
and we've combined the secrets
of all three of those noodle dishes.

625
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:25,104
This is buckwheat noodle dough.
80% buckwheat, and 20% flour.

626
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:26,825
[John Park is doing a great job of explaining
unlike his partner.]

627
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:32,319
- Keep turning the dough while you roll it.
- Keep it turning?

628
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,675
So that it's evenly rolled out?

629
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:38,320
I told you to do that earlier!
Don't you ever listen to me?

630
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,487
Thank you for your advice.

631
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:43,655
We have the utmost respect for you.

632
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:51,627
[Giraffe is busier kissing butt
than he is with the actual cooking process.]

633
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:53,940
I think I'm just tuning you out.

634
00:40:56,285 --> 00:41:00,186
[Raymond Kim and Jung Da Jung stop by
Jong Kook and Kyung Ah's station.]

635
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,517
What are you doing?
What is the dish that you're cooking?

636
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:09,073
We're making chicken stew right now.
We're focusing on making it really healthy.

637
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,919
So we're adding abalone and
octopus to our stew.

638
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,942
So we're attempting to add more complex
flavors by adding in these ingredients.

639
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:22,376
We wanted to see some creativity,
but it seems to be a pretty common dish.

640
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:25,434
[Lack of creativity is some cause for concern
since it's a pretty common dish.]

641
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:27,487
But we do like the addition of the abalone.

642
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,654
But we do have a small hidden surprise
inside the chicken.

643
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,787
- We have a small surprise in there.
- Did you add something in there?

644
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,111
You didn't add any eggs
inside the chicken, did you?

645
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,294
[Totally caught?]

646
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,289
- What do you think about this?
- About what?

647
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,369
Most people put something inside
the chicken's cavity...

648
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:49,276
- How about adding eggs?
- Eggs?

649
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:52,062
[Their plan was to add hard boiled eggs
inside the chicken's cavity!]

650
00:41:52,063 --> 00:41:55,689
[These eggs will bring about
a surprise in a little bit.]

651
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,019
We're barely going to add
any bit of seasoning in our dish.

652
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,322
[No use of any seasoning.
Smallest bit of salt to keep it healthy.]

653
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,317
[What's going on there?]

654
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,366
[Not a single peaceful moment
in this competition.]

655
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,060
- What do we do?
- Turn off the heat.

656
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:22,082
We're in trouble!
There's a big problem!

657
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:28,415
[Must've forgotten that they already
added the cooking oil in the frying pan.]

658
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:32,401
I don't want to sound rude,
but can we be a bit more cautious?

659
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,991
Let the taste of our dish
do the talking.

660
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:42,392
Having you...

661
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,520
Having you watch me made me nervous.

662
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,964
- Yes, I understand.
- You'll never get it done with one knife.

663
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,239
Yes, Ma'am!

664
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:59,540
[Discovers Yoo Hyuk in the process
of slicing his garlic.]

665
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,911
- Are you slicing that?
- Yes, I am.

666
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:06,084
- The knife can't be angled inward.
- Like this then?

667
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:08,262
- Angle it outward.
- Yes, I understand.

668
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:10,653
[Instructing him to be careful
to eliminate chances of an injury.]

669
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:14,767
You have to change your grip.
You're holding it all wrong!

670
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:20,710
- When you hold something, flex your wrist.
- Like this?

671
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:23,820
Yes, that's right.
I just told you not to do that!

672
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:27,149
- No, angle it up.
- Oh, I see.

673
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,016
[Her mini lesson is enough to
make Yoo Hyuk sweat bullets.]

674
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:31,183
- That's more natural.
- Yes, I understand.

675
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:34,061
Keep practicing, and the slices will come out
looking so pretty.

676
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:38,708
Look at this finger.
Why is that finger sticking out?

677
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,280
- This finger needs to go back.
- Like this?

678
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,793
[This is finally the correct
positioning of the hand.]

679
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,736
- Are you making a mix?
- Yes, I'm preparing it.

680
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:57,152
- How are you making the mix?
- I'm using even water to powder ratio.

681
00:43:57,153 --> 00:44:02,172
- And I'm going to add it to the fish...
- Looks like you know what you're doing.

682
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,434
[So envious...]

683
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,499
Happy new year everyone.

684
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,291
[Even early this morning...]

685
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:16,150
[Soo Hong didn't even get to chance to get
a word in edgewise around Jae Suk.]

686
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:19,794
You caught something?

687
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:24,116
[But with his catching
of the three rockfish...]

688
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:27,863
[The tables have been totally
turned around.]

689
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:32,129
Why don't you say something now?
You were going on and on talking about

690
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,650
this and that to all the audience
members earlier this morning.

691
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,033
Tell them how you're still empty-handed.

692
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,743
[The moment that marked
the shifting of power...]

693
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:46,522
[Complete shift in power
once the cooking started.]

694
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,609
[Even she's giving
all her praises to Soo Hong...]

695
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:59,124
[Ah... how heartbreaking...]

696
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:01,561
Let's just put this one in.

697
00:45:01,562 --> 00:45:03,394
[Sneaking a hardboiled egg
inside the chicken cavity.]

698
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:08,299
[If they're not careful,
they could ruin the look of the chicken...]

699
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,316
I'll push it in there.

700
00:45:13,484 --> 00:45:17,693
[How to... put this in there?]

701
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:19,642
What am I doing here?

702
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:22,073
To put so much effort into this?

703
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:25,952
- Can you move this part a little?
- I'm afraid it'll ruin the chicken.

704
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:28,639
[Afraid of ruining the egg and the chicken.]

705
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:35,161
[Attempt to decorate with the egg
is giving them an unnecessary quandary.]

706
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:37,776
Did you get it in there?
It won't be cooked if we don't put it in now.

707
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:42,373
[We will get this egg in there
to surprise everyone!]

708
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:45,695
[Doctor Kkuk will make this happen.]

709
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:49,061
[Operation 'Input the hardboiled egg.']

710
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,914
Good luck, Jong Kook.

711
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,266
I know you can do it.

712
00:45:57,816 --> 00:45:59,663
I cracked the egg.

713
00:46:01,753 --> 00:46:04,136
You have to be more careful!

714
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,495
[Emergency operation!
Must eliminate the cracked egg!]

715
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,413
You have to get that out of there quickly.

716
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:13,414
[Recruits Dr. Song.]

717
00:46:13,415 --> 00:46:16,323
You have to keep the leg up
so that it doesn't fall back down.

718
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:21,067
You don't think you can get it in there?
There's no chance of that happening?

719
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:25,304
[Really sounds like
they're in the operation room.]

720
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:31,190
Wait a minute.

721
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:33,141
Should we just forget about it?

722
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:39,700
[Total concentration.]

723
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,562
We have to get this egg out.

724
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:49,996
[Hardboiled egg... please come out of there.]

725
00:46:51,464 --> 00:46:53,582
Are you trying to bring
the dead chicken back to life?

726
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:56,954
They're trying to bring the dead chicken
back to life.

727
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:59,312
[Jong Kook and Kyung Ah in danger?]

728
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,562
- It's too deep in there.
- We should've put it in there earlier on.

729
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:06,261
You must've felt really bad
for the chicken.

730
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:09,746
You think you can get it out?

731
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:13,680
The only way we can do this is
if we can lift up the chicken.

732
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:15,576
- I think that's going to break the chicken.
- We have to lift it up slightly.

733
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,397
It did go in there.

734
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:27,007
The tongs!
I need the tongs!

735
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:30,369
Grab it!
Use the tongs to grab the egg!

736
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,638
[An extremely dangerous situation.]

737
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,704
- Wait!
- Grab the egg!

738
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:38,494
- Grab it and pull it out!
- Hang on!

739
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:42,397
[Dr. Kkuk and Dr. Song's operation succeeds!]

740
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:46,543
[Ten years shaved off their lives.]

741
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:51,041
- Did you operate successfully?
- We got it.

742
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:54,406
[The hardboiled egg is given
a new lease on life?]

743
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:56,845
We don't have any more time.
We have to do it now if we're going to do it.

744
00:47:56,846 --> 00:48:00,081
I think I have a solution.
Put your hand in really cold water first.

745
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:04,248
[Numb the hand in icy cold water first?]

746
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:12,152
[I will succeed this time!]

747
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:16,380
[Second attempt with the chicken.]

748
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:18,768
- You can't pull it part.
- I'm holding it together.

749
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:24,306
[Their second attempt isn't proving
to be any easier either.]

750
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:32,454
- You're not cautious enough.
- Come on, Jong Kook.

751
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:35,007
- You're too wild with that.
- Hang on a minute.

752
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:40,132
[The two doctors are arguing with one another
to leave each other to do the work.]

753
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:43,649
- We don't have time for this, Jong Kook.
- This is no simple matter.

754
00:48:44,743 --> 00:48:46,415
You're so frustrating!

755
00:48:47,496 --> 00:48:49,528
Where did you go?
Come back here and grab it.

756
00:48:49,529 --> 00:48:51,960
- You're so frustrating!
- Come grab it.

757
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:53,722
Grab it.
You have to lift this up.

758
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,235
Don't pull it apart too much
because you don't want to tear it.

759
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:00,681
I always seem to get sucked in
whenever Jong Kook tells me to do something.

760
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:05,284
So I was annoyed for about an hour,
but felt better for about ten minutes after.

761
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:07,348
It was like a nonstop rollercoaster.

762
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:09,378
Close it.
Close it up for right now.

763
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:14,568
This has to go under there.

764
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:17,171
We should've used a quail egg.

765
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:20,625
We should've put it in at the beginning.
How many times have I told you that?

766
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:22,583
Grab this leg.

767

- You got it.
- It's in there.

770
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:41,221
We got it.

[The surgery is a success.]

772
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,192
Good job, Jong Kook.

773
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,335
I have no idea what's going on.

774
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,870

Leeks and the onion.

in the sauce first...]

into a state of panic.]

- Hang on.
- What did she tell us to do again?

783
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:32,600
- Pour the broth in here.
- In there?

784
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:39,403
Okay!

785
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,285
That's good.
That's too much!

[Too much broth!]

787
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:48,045
- Why did you put so much in here?
- We can just add in more sauce.

788
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,729
We can boil it down.

789
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,646
- You're an accident waiting to happen!
- Just boil it down.

790

[Now that they take a closer look...
the Rocker isn't so domesticated after all?]

[The rockfish is ultimately in two pieces...]

802
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:01,818
[Who could've guessed that the trusted
Chef Hong would make such a mistake?]

803
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,890
[The whole fish's shape is ruined...]

804
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:08,742
I think that since Soo Hong does a lot of
cooking shows...

805
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:12,070
people make the mistake of thinking
that he's a professional chef or something.

806
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:16,206
But he usually orders in a lot,
and he doesn't cook all that often.

807
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,788
The tail should still be attached.

808
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:26,585
[Too bad for the poor rockfish...]

809
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:29,307
I remember that the exact same thing happened
to me once during a cooking competition.

810
00:52:29,308 --> 00:52:31,176
- You know how I fixed it?
- How?

811
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:34,199
I just poured a lot of sauce on top.
Then you can't tell that it's in two pieces.

812
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,588
We're going to disguise it with
the sauce topping.

813
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:43,206
[The separated rockfish...
Will they be able to disguise it?]

814
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:49,159
[Gary and Jae Kyung are starting to
grill their sanjeok.]

815
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:01,370
I think we need to add in some more pear.

816
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:05,734
[Deciding to add in more of the grated pear
after doing a quick taste test.]

817
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,127
- Pick just a few pieces.
- The best looking ones?

818
00:53:09,128 --> 00:53:12,163
- Let's do two a piece, not three.
- Two a piece?

819
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:18,163
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyu are finished cooking
their side menu item, dduk galbi.]

820
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:22,123
I think we need to taste one
to see how it turned out.

821
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:26,516
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyu also taste one
of their pieces to test for seasoning.]

822
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:33,123
[Huh?]

823
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:34,987
You guys just made this?

824
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:37,673
[Feeding a bite to their neighbor, Kyung Ho.]

825
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:41,202
- It's undercooked.
- It's undercooked, right?

826
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,497
It's completely raw in the middle.

827
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:45,864
No, I'm serious.
It's still raw in the middle.

828
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:48,758
And... it's really bland.

829
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,028
- It's bland?
- Yeah.

830
00:53:52,198 --> 00:53:53,278
Hey.

831
00:53:53,722 --> 00:53:55,317
It's bland?

832
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,840
We're in danger.
This one is about to burn.

833
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:00,069
It's starting to burn.
I can't control the heat temperature.

834
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,938
Then let's just make one.

835
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,277
[In the end, they ultimately decide to grill
only one piece of the dduk galbi...]

836
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:20,629
[After a whole hour...
John Park is still working on the noodles.]

837
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:26,559
[He finally managed to make noodles resembling
strands after all his hard work...]

838
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,468
[The boiling water is overflowing...]

839
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:39,851
What do I do?

840
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:43,778
[I hope no one saw that.]

841
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:45,426
It should still be okay, right?

842
00:54:48,978 --> 00:54:52,452
[The noodles are finally starting to cook.]

843
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:55,059
We just need the noodles to
finish cooking.

844
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:57,992
But we've been cooking the noodles
for 40 minutes now.

845
00:54:57,993 --> 00:55:00,521
[The noodles have been cooking
for 40 minutes already...]

846
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:03,253
- Is it never going to finish cooking?
- I think it's better to have it soggy.

847
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:06,083
Having it soggy is better than
having it be undercooked.

848
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,164
[Will they be able to save their dish?]

849
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:18,084
[Hm... that looks a bit...]

850
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,152
Can we even present our dish
when it looks like this?

851
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,294
What if they cuss us out?

852
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:28,561
[In a few moments...]

853
00:55:28,562 --> 00:55:31,879
[Getting ready to cuss them out?]

854
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:37,813
[Serious panel of judges.]

855
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:40,856
[Cold and cruel judging.]

856
00:55:41,656 --> 00:55:44,004
You ruined it right from the beginning.

857
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:48,074
[Honest and raw judging that
no one can escape from will soon start.]

858
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:50,008
- Okay, I'm putting it in.
- Okay.

859
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:52,929
- It's time.
- It's time?

860
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:57,424
- Put it all in there.
- It's time to put it in.

861
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,466
We're good.
This is it.

862
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:05,488
What's that?

863
00:56:06,178 --> 00:56:09,548
We're going to shock you with our dish.
Look at how beautiful that looks.

864
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:11,228
[The crab porridge alone is enough
to make our mouths water.]

865
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,640
- Doesn't it look good?
- Are you two operating a restaurant?

866
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,858
- It's bitter.
- Bitter?

867
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,673
[Huh? It's bitter?]

868
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:20,560
- What are you doing?
- It's still undercooked.

869
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,401
- Let's try it.
- I'll taste it for seasoning.

870
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:26,117
- Okay, try it.
- Let me try it.

871
00:56:26,118 --> 00:56:29,025
[The eel stir-fry that has been boiled down
from too much broth added to it...]

872
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:32,895
[How would it taste?]

873
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:36,066
How is it?

874
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,610
- It's good.
- Seriously?

875
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:38,949
Really?

876
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:45,545
But... is it okay for the eel
to be this tender?

877
00:56:46,595 --> 00:56:51,615
[The eel lost its signature chewiness
from having been cooked for too long.]

878
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:55,707
We can just tell them that it's tender
because it's all natural.

879
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,232
[Ten minutes before the time is up.]

880
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:05,502
[Time for all the teams to start
wrapping things up.]

881
00:57:05,503 --> 00:57:07,626
- Lets leave it up to fate.
- Should we?

882
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:12,987
I'll start cleaning up.

883
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:15,641
[Detailed assistant starts
the cleanup process.]

884
00:57:20,075 --> 00:57:24,483
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook's delicious
looking king crab stew.]

885
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,813
We just need to simmer a bit longer.
This is perfect.

886
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,677
Cooking seriously is no joke.

887
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:37,493
- This is too hard.
- I think bungee jumping in Macao was easier.

888
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,702
[Would rather jump from the tower
in Macau over doing this?]

889
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:43,461
[Oyster and teot muchim is complete!]

890
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,740
Don't forget the pepper.
Two pieces.

891
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:48,072
- There you go.
- Not bad, right?

892
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:51,888
Just top it off.
There you go. Great job!

893
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:55,154
[Domesticated Rocker's softer image.]

894
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:02,541
No, that's too much.
It doesn't look pretty.

895
00:58:07,018 --> 00:58:11,925
[Everyone is finalizing
their finishing touches to their dishes.]

896
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:13,625
This is our highlight of the day.

897
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:15,920
I will not top it off
with the spicy pepper paste.

898
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:19,285
[Time to add in the pepper sauce topping-
The bibimbap's main highlight.]

899
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:22,823
[Secret spicy pepper paste
brought all the way back from Jeonju.]

900
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:30,063
[Beautiful and vibrantly red
pepper paste.]

901
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,165
This is it.

902
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:40,625
We're going to have to move it around a bit
so that the edges don't burn.

903
00:58:40,626 --> 00:58:42,410
[Gary and Jae Kyung's dish
is grilling up beautifully.]

904
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:51,348
[Jae Suk and Soo Hong's sweet and sour
sauce is nearing completion.]

905
00:58:56,593 --> 00:59:00,212
[Lastly... disguising the crumbled fish tail.]

906
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,915
Three minutes!
Three minutes until time is up!

907
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:06,312
No!

908
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:10,153
- Do you think it needs more sauce?
- No.

909
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:13,374
[Even some fancy decoration
to complete the dish.]

910
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:16,346
[Following her chef mother's advice and
decorating it with slivered scallions.]

911
00:59:23,669 --> 00:59:31,789
[Everyone's starting to
hurry their movements.]

912
00:59:33,513 --> 00:59:35,309
30 seconds!

913
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,529
Put more crab in there.

914
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:41,892
- That looks really pretty.
- You think?

915
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:45,535
[Kyung Ah uses flowers to put
her final finishing touch.]

916
00:59:45,536 --> 00:59:47,890
I think putting it together
like that is better.

917
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,460
Seriously!

918
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:54,948
[The bickering chicken couple.]

919
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,990
Put it on there in a round mound.

920
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:03,000
- How does it look, Jong Kook?
- That looks so pretty.

921
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:04,546
Not bad, right?

922
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:08,098
Unbelievably beautiful.

923
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:14,770
Ten seconds!
Ten seconds!

924
01:00:14,771 --> 01:00:16,734
[Ten minutes left on the clock!]

925
01:00:16,735 --> 01:00:18,911
- Okay!
- Almost done!

926
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:22,079
- Wait!
- Right now! Hurry!

927
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:26,383
[Secret edible decor- Gold flakes!]

928
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:35,699
[Everyone heads to the judging table
with their completed dishes in hand.]

929
01:00:40,657 --> 01:00:44,951
[Time's up!]

930
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:46,729
We did finish it.

931
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,751
Make sure my path is clear.

932
01:00:51,723 --> 01:00:53,970
This is dangerous.
Be careful and don't come close.

933
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:03,976
[Just which of these dishes...]

934
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:12,823
[Will become the main star
of the dinner table?]

935
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:22,808
We will now start the final judging of
your 2014 Running Man Cooking Battle.

936
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:27,898
Each team will present their dish to the panel
of judges and wait for their results.

937
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,256
[The cooking competition that's
kept them on their toes all day...]

938
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,181
[It's time to determine the ultimate winner.]

939
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:42,434
[Jae Suk and Soo Hong
are the first to present their dish.]

940
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:45,272
We got up early this morning to go fishing

941
01:01:45,273 --> 01:01:48,789
for the main ingredient of our dish.
Caught fresh from the ocean this morning...

942
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:54,002
It's spicy rockfish stew and sweet and sour
rockfish with the fish we caught ourselves.

943
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:04,986
[Soo Hong, who caught three rockfish
early this morning...]

944
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,850
This is unbelievable!

945
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:08,916
This is bigger than my face!

946
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:12,403
[Dishes made up of the fresh rockfish
they themselves caught early this morning.]

947
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,997
I actually heard that it's pretty difficult
to catch rockfish in the middle of winter.

948
01:02:17,998 --> 01:02:24,935
Just like how fresh fish can be caught with
some patience and dedication even in winter...

949
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:27,684
it's the same belief that we can overcome
anything during times of our trial.

950
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:31,228
When everyone else told us
that it's impossible...

951
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,212
we were still able to make it happen.

952
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:36,114
Even though the captain himself told us
that it was difficult to catch rockfish...

953
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:38,669
- When no one had any faith in us...
- To be honest, we didn't have faith either.

954
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,526
But as you can see, these rockfish...
they came to be with us here today...

955
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:44,618
by sacrificing their own lives.

956
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,396
They wanted to sacrifice their lives
to offer you their flesh.

957
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:53,906
- That's what the rockfish decided.
- Yes, that's correct.

958
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:59,010
That's why they sacrificed their lives
to hang themselves on our fishhooks.

959
01:02:59,737 --> 01:03:02,067
Our food is getting cold!

960
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:03,924
[That's right...]

961
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:06,811
- We'll just give you a little to taste.
- I want a big serving of it.

962
01:03:07,648 --> 01:03:09,593
Give her more.

963
01:03:09,594 --> 01:03:12,568
[Serving the panel of judges himself.]

964
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:17,578
Please enjoy it with the fish.
I'll give you more fish in yours.

965
01:03:18,745 --> 01:03:21,094
The fish is really fresh and delicious.

966
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:28,482
[Time for the real taste test.]

967
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:39,296
<i>If you stand right there,
then the judges won't show up on camera.</i>

968
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:41,310
- What are you doing?
- Can you get out of the way?

969
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,113
- You're blocking the judges.
- You guys are so disappointing.

970
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,005
I just want to win the gold and go home.

971
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,049
It's a little fishy.

972
01:03:57,828 --> 01:03:59,193
- Too fishy?
- Too fishy.

973
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:01,979
[The rockfish is too fishy?]

974
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:09,375
[It's still fishy?
Even after sprinkling it with the curry?]

975
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,216
[How can that be?]

976
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,436
[Time to start the judging
after tasting the dishes.]

977
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,489
It's not presented very well.

978
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,362
This is really nerve wrecking.

979
01:04:22,356 --> 01:04:25,418
[Four professionals' fair judging.]

980
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:37,524
To be objective, the sweet and sour rockfish
didn't look anything like it should've looked.

981
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,867
<i>Didn't look anything like it
should've looked.</i>

982
01:04:41,593 --> 01:04:48,358
It just looked like chunks of fish with
some sweet and sour sauce drizzled on top.

983
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:51,630
- That to me was pretty unappealing.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

984
01:04:54,453 --> 01:04:56,862
[The studio has all of a sudden
become silent as a tomb.]

985
01:04:56,863 --> 01:04:59,469
The seasoning of the fish stew
was just right.

986
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:01,655
However...

987
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:03,814
The stew was too overcooked.

988
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:12,254
Overcooked to a point where I wasn't sure
if I was chewing the broth or the fish.

989
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:17,256
[Her slam leaves them speechless.]

990
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:23,329
I'd like to say though that the stew
was seasoned very well.

991
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:24,681
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

992
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:30,492
[This really... is no joke.]

993
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:42,607
[Second team- Jong Kook and Kyung Ah.]

994
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:54,409
The reason why we chose
to cook this dish was because...

995
01:05:54,410 --> 01:06:00,140
I was never even able to make ramen for
my parents from my inability to cook at all.

996
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:05,138
But with the new year, I really wanted
to be able to cook this dish for my parents.

997
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,542
- Did you have any say in cooking this dish?
- No. Never.

998
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:13,781
I didn't even fathom making this dish.

999
01:06:13,782 --> 01:06:17,308
I thought we were going to make something
more grand and fancier than this.

1000
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:19,609
I wanted to cook something fancier
than this.

1001
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,155
But Jong Kook said he wanted to cook something
reminiscent of a mom's home cooked meal.

1002
01:06:23,156 --> 01:06:25,492
Something homey and healthy.

1003
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:30,808
Cooking something healthy was our main focus
and that's why we've prepared this dish.

1004
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:34,592
We've also added some mushrooms
in the dish.

1005
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:39,024
We went to a mushroom farm
to bring them back ourselves to add it.

1006
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:43,348
Even though this may seem plain
to professionals like yourselves

1007
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:44,984
but it was still a shocking process to me.

1008
01:06:44,985 --> 01:06:47,480
I really didn't add any additives at all.

1009
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:49,909
- It's amazing how well it turned out.
- Stop talking so much.

1010
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:53,104
You're really going overboard.

1011
01:06:53,685 --> 01:06:56,874
[His explanation may take all night.]

1012
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:59,635
All our dishes are going to get cold.

1013
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,368
[Domesticated Rocker's protest.]

1014
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:08,748
I was really surprised myself.

1015
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:15,875
[Kudos for the great presentation
and the beautiful plating.]

1016
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,856
- You only used salt?
- We used the smallest bit of salt.

1017
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:23,432
[Least bit of salt possible was used.]

1018
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:25,935
We added just enough to give it
a bit of seasoning.

1019
01:07:35,774 --> 01:07:39,112
[Taste the fresh kimchi too.]

1020
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:45,990
[Slowly approaching...]

1021
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,743
[Other contestants are
wildly protesting his move.]

1022
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:53,025
There's also a hardboiled egg
inside the chicken.

1023
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:56,929
[Boasting about the hardboiled egg that
they worked so hard to get in the chicken.]

1024
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:00,468
There are countless breastless
chickens that are waiting for you in hell.

1025
01:08:01,504 --> 01:08:03,468
All the chickens are mad at you.

1026
01:08:05,806 --> 01:08:09,667
I was shocked by the beauty
of the whole cooking process.

1027
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:12,778
- We're being very sincere about that.
- This is seasoned perfectly.

1028
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:14,776
This is seasoned perfectly.

1029
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:18,338
[First compliment of the day!]

1030
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:20,040
Both the dishes are seasoned
perfectly well.

1031
01:08:23,594 --> 01:08:26,098
- Thank you for the compliment.
- You two better start dating.

1032
01:08:27,217 --> 01:08:32,392
Pork and chicken are known for
having a high fat content.

1033
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:40,071
It's really difficult to dissolve the amount
of fat that's in those types of meat.

1034
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:47,851
But when you eat the fatty meat and
the fresh kimchi together like this...

1035
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:51,705
it really helps with the digestion process.

1036
01:08:51,706 --> 01:08:54,692
It really is a perfect pairing.

1037
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:56,113
[Perfect pairing made in heaven.]

1038
01:08:56,114 --> 01:09:04,196
Adding in the mushrooms like you did really
brought up the healthy factor

1039
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:10,764
and the abalone that you added in there
is really good for elderly people's eyes.

1040
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,248
You two did a great job with
your ingredient selection

1041
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,619
and did a great job with
cooking the dishes as well.

1042
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,699
[Great ingredients and great cooking.]

1043
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:22,634
[Unexpected level of compliments.]

1044
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:28,163
[Still full of compliments even after
the judging is over.]

1045
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:36,907
[Unexpected level of compliments-
Possible first place contenders?]

1046
01:09:36,908 --> 01:09:38,915
I feel bad for our rockfish.

1047
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,734
I amazed even myself with how
delicious the dishes turned out.

1048
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,130
- Are you talking about your dish right now?
- Yes.

1049
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,473
I don't want to hear it.

1050
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:54,154
[Soo Hong is upset from the comments
that he heard from the judges.]

1051
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:56,172
How is it my fault
that the rockfish was fishy?

1052
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,615
I should've had a better partner.

1053
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:07,664
Seriously.

1054
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:13,224
The name of our menu is,
crab-a-licious dinner menu.

1055
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:21,006
[Crab-a-licious dinner menu.]

1056
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:23,327
We went to Pohang to get these crabs.
The reason why we went there is because

1057
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:27,065
Pohang is very famous for the hand sculpture
that is seen sticking out of the water.

1058
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:32,149
So from the location where so many people
go to see the first sunrise of the new year

1059
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,113
we wanted to make our dish with
the iconic ingredient of that area.

1060
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:39,211
So we figured that it may be the most ideal
dish to make for the new year dinner

1061
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:40,896
so that's why we chose to make
what we did.

1062
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:01,701
The porridge is a little bland, so we
recommend that you eat it with the stew.

1063
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:06,283
It's more like a rice ball
rather than porridge.

1064
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:09,939
I've never had porridge like this
in all my life.

1065
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,100
[Other's misfortune... is my own happiness?]

1066
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:19,922
Porridge is all about formula.

1067
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,659
It's always five cups of water for
every cup of rice used.

1068
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:31,169
[Five cups of water for one cup of rice
is the perfect ratio.]

1069
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:34,719
- I understand.
- So this was ruined from the beginning.

1070
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,219
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1071
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:38,969
It's such a waste of this
beautiful crab.

1072
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:41,403
This dish is totally ruined.

1073
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:43,641
<i>This dish is totally ruined.</i>

1074
01:11:48,232 --> 01:11:53,155
This is a very new approach to me.
I've never had porridge with stew before.

1075
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,661
They're really twisting in the knife.

1076

[Angry clubber is taking pleasure
in their misery?]

1077

Do I need to twist your arm back?

1078
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:09,910
You did a good job of
steaming the crab though.

1079
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:11,726
- Thank you.
- Steaming the crabs are not easy to do.

1080
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,609
[They still got some compliments
on the steamed crabs.]

The name of our menu is...
'Miss Mixy lost her rib bones.'

1086

sacred food.

a pair of chopsticks.]

1088

Thank you.

1089
01:13:18,506 --> 01:13:23,424
<i>I know that the dduk galbi may be overkill,
but the bibimbap is undoubtedly our star.</i>

1090
01:13:24,103 --> 01:13:27,013
And we also made some bean sprout soup
that is totally unexpected by anyone.

1091
01:13:27,014 --> 01:13:28,649
We made it cold.

1092
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:32,271
I made with my own two hands.

1093
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:42,360
[Time to test out Ha Ha's secret weapon-

1096
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:47,852
- Is it good?
- It tastes like water.

1097
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,210
I purposely made it bland to balance
the saltiness of bibimbap.

1098
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:53,239
Eating too salty makes you gain weight.

1099
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,396
Did you just diss the judge?

1100
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:58,423
[A huge mistake of insulting the judge?]

1101
01:13:58,424 --> 01:14:00,390
- I'm sorry! I'll lose some weight!
- No! That's not what I meant!

1102
01:14:02,652 --> 01:14:04,305
I'll lose weight.

1103
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:08,913
This is a very healthy meal because
bibimbap is really good for your health.

1104
01:14:08,914 --> 01:14:12,265
You can't just let him off the hook
after that kind of insult.

1105
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:13,438
But...

- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

1108
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:24,291
It's difficult to make it this good
when neither one of you are experts in it.

1109
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:27,770
- You two did a very good job.
- I think it was planned out very well.

1110
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:31,822
The soup, bibimbap and even the meat...

1111
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:35,887
It's actually a very good combination.
But just work on getting the seasoning right.

1112
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,724
Did you just poach the bean sprouts
and bring it out as soup?

1113
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,698
In the water that you poached it in?

1114
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,725
In the poaching water?
No, we cooked it again.

1115
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:48,090
I think it would've been really nice
had you put some salt in it.

1116
01:14:48,091 --> 01:14:50,507
But the bibimbap was very delicious.

1117
01:14:50,508 --> 01:14:53,108
I don't know if I'm having a growth spurt,
but everything is quite delicious.

01:15:30,968 --> 01:15:34,039
It doesn't look like any of
the judges really care.

1126
01:15:42,503 --> 01:15:46,060
<i>Kyung Ho and I went out to the ocean this
morning and climbed the rocks ourselves...</i>

1127
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:51,062
[So?]

1128
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:59,385
The first thought that entered my mind
when I saw your menu...

1129
01:15:59,386 --> 01:16:02,475
You said you went out to get all these
ingredients yourselves, right?

1130
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,549
But I don't get the feeling
that the ingredients are all that fresh.

1131
01:16:07,955 --> 01:16:11,043
If anything, it makes me wonder if
the ingredients may have gone bad.

1132
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:12,917
We went out to get
the ingredients ourselves.

1133
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:14,986
You don't have to try eating it
if you don't want to.

1134
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,944
Kyung Ho and Suk Jin really do look like
a married couple from behind.

1135
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:24,073
The head daughter-in-law.

1136
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,478
A daughter-in-law who's disliked
by the mother-in-law.

1137
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:32,146
[Time for the taste test.]

1138
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:38,682
Not many people know what teot is
because it's not very widely known.

1139
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:42,002
I think you added too much garlic in it,
so it's overly spicy.

1140
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:46,269
- I apologize for the spiciness.
- I told you we should've switched it out.

1141
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:50,269
It's a really good idea,
but it's not seasoned very well.

1142
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:54,920
How about you just give them a swift smack
in the rear and call it a day?

1143
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,402
I think it's good.

1144
01:17:00,464 --> 01:17:03,504
[Totally unexpected]

1145
01:17:04,096 --> 01:17:05,613
Do you like to drink?

1146
01:17:05,614 --> 01:17:07,195
Yes, I go crazy for it.

1147
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:13,303
- Yes, I do like it.
- In all my life...

1148
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:17,047
I have never met anyone who cooks
eel to quite this extent.

1149
01:17:17,048 --> 01:17:21,080
Since the eel is the star of this dish,
it shouldn't crumble down like this.

1150
01:17:21,923 --> 01:17:26,751
So I'm a little disappointed with the eel,
but the taste is really authentic.

1151
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:31,013
You did a good job of bringing out
the spicy savoriness of the dish.

1152
01:17:31,014 --> 01:17:33,644
- Thank you.
- A bit more study...

1153
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:36,242
and I think you may be able to
make a living with this dish.

1154
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:44,704
[Another totally unexpected surprise.]

1155
01:17:45,564 --> 01:17:50,348
This dish would've been really delicious if
the eel had been grilled or fried separately.

1156
01:17:52,713 --> 01:17:54,713
[Suk Jin and Kyung Ho are shocked and
delighted by their unexpected complements.]

1157
01:17:55,779 --> 01:18:03,327
[The panel of judges' warm reception-
Will it result in their favor?]

1158
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,890
[Next up- Gary and Jae Kyung.]

1159
01:18:10,261 --> 01:18:13,355
- Tea too?
- The name of our menu is...

1160
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:14,921
Sanjeok...

1161
01:18:15,459 --> 01:18:17,410
is love.

1162
01:18:17,411 --> 01:18:19,232
[Sanjeok is love.]

1163
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:29,532
- I'm going to love through this sanjeok.
- How are you always talking about love?

1164
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:32,268
What's the first thing you think of
when you hear of Naju?

1165
01:18:32,269 --> 01:18:33,665
- Pears.
- Yes, pears.

1166
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:37,312
Each one of our dishes was made
with the pear being part of the ingredients.

1167
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:39,362
[Naju pear is in each and
every one of these dishes.]

1168
01:18:39,363 --> 01:18:40,973
The sanjeok is what brings everything
and everyone together.

1169
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:45,890
Father minces the meat,
mother makes the seasoning sauce

1170
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:49,141
and older brother grates the pear
to make pear extract...

1171
01:18:50,586 --> 01:18:54,879
All the love from each of these
family members are combined together

1172
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,057
to complete the circle of love that
makes up our sanjeok.

1173
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,040
I know that everyone is struggling
with cold and flu lately too.

1174
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,890
So we made some tea with the pear that is
known to be a natural cough suppressant

1175
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,558
and along with the meat on the menu,
which will keep you fuller for longer

1176
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:14,201
we thought it would be a great compliment to
each other with digestive and overall health.

1177
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:16,283
No matter what they're spewing,
taste is what matters the most.

1178
01:19:17,311 --> 01:19:19,623
- Jae Kyung is a ham.
- Yeah, she's really good.

1179
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:22,315
- She's smart.
- She really is something else.

1180
01:19:34,909 --> 01:19:37,953
[The judges continue to eat
without uttering a word.]

1181
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:41,210
[Even the onlookers are watching
with baited breath.]

1182
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,562
Did you cook the sanjeok medium
on purpose?

1183
01:19:48,563 --> 01:19:51,066
Yes, the beef that was used was so fresh

1184
01:19:51,067 --> 01:19:54,629
so we didn't want the meat to lose its flavor
by overcooking the meat too much.

1185
01:19:56,348 --> 01:19:59,677
[Easily answers the judge's question
without getting flustered by it.]

1186
01:20:02,023 --> 01:20:05,143
[Time to taste the dessert.]

1187
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:10,229
[The only team out of all the contestants
to have prepared a dessert dish.]

1188
01:20:12,315 --> 01:20:15,075
I know you said that pear was used,
and the pear...

1189
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:18,188
[What will she say?]

1190
01:20:18,573 --> 01:20:23,439
was a delight in the dish,
and it's good for digestion as well.

1191
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,593
It's a perfect complement to
this meat dish.

1192
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:30,970
I really liked that the dish is representative
of authentic Korean cuisine.

1193
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:36,898
I also liked the fact that you used jujube,
which is iconic of our country's cuisine.

1194
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:41,233
Also, I know that you used honey
and lemon in the tea?

1195
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:46,246
The taste of the two wasn't overpowering,
but it was very light and complimentary.

1196
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:48,393
I believe that it was balanced out perfectly.

1197
01:20:48,394 --> 01:20:50,405
- I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

1198
01:20:50,406 --> 01:20:51,977
[Dessert expert,
Louie Kang's compliments.]

1199
01:20:53,904 --> 01:21:01,777
[Sanjeok of love-
Could the victory be theirs?]

1200
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,063
[Time for the final dish.]

1201
01:21:04,064 --> 01:21:06,631
[Kwang Soo and John Park's dish.]

1202
01:21:07,179 --> 01:21:09,607
It's a bowl of noodles and boiled pork belly.

1203
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:11,711
[Buckwheat noodles and pork belly.]

1204
01:21:11,712 --> 01:21:14,967
Panel of judges... Happy New Year.

1205
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:18,676
[A grand bow out of nowhere.]

1206
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:26,669
The dish that we've prepared
is buckwheat noodles with pork belly.

1207
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:30,724
Back in our poorer days...

1208
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:36,309
when we had valuable guests come to our
house, we'd slaughter a pig from our stock.

1209
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:41,553
I was told that along with the pig,
we'd prepare a bowl of noodles to serve.

1210
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:43,616
So along those same lines...

1211
01:21:43,617 --> 01:21:47,309
with our utmost love and respect
for our panel of judges...

1212
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,624
we couldn't think of anything better
than this menu to serve you.

1213
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:52,685
I'm sorry, but can you explain the meaning
of 'Hwa-Jeon-Min' to us?

1214
01:21:52,686 --> 01:21:54,734
[Does he even know what he's saying?]

1215
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:56,805
Does it mean, 'flower'?

1216
01:22:00,732 --> 01:22:04,278
Is that why...
you sprinkled gold flakes on your dish?

1217
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:09,255
Running Man always gives out
a gold prize to the winner.

1218
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:14,436
The gold flakes are to symbolize how
we're all winners in the new year.

1219
01:22:14,437 --> 01:22:17,022
That's why we used the gold flakes
to decorate our dish.

1220
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,381
How can he say such a thing without
any sense of embarrassment?

1221
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:25,745
Please enjoy the dish.

1222
01:22:28,547 --> 01:22:32,445
- Did you make the spicy muchim yourself?
- We were told that it needed to ferment...

1223
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:34,121
- So you brought it already made?
- Yes.

1224
01:22:36,636 --> 01:22:39,840
- That was the only thing.
- No, we actually made it ourselves.

1225
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:42,471
You really shouldn't lie.

1226
01:22:49,154 --> 01:22:50,877
Kwang Soo...

1227
01:22:51,578 --> 01:22:54,053
Let's not be partnered up
together from now on.

1228
01:22:56,651 --> 01:22:59,087
You did good.
There's nothing else we can do now.

1229
01:23:02,735 --> 01:23:04,543
[Only way to get the noodles
is to use a spoon.]

1230
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:06,995
- Isn't the meat a little smelly?
- The meat still has hair on it.

1231
01:23:08,844 --> 01:23:10,339
I'm going to tell them that.

1232
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:15,717
John Park said he'd like to sing you a song
to make your dining experience more enjoyable.

1233
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,741
- But...
- Let's do whatever we can.

1234
01:23:24,742 --> 01:23:26,332
We need to do everything that we can.

1235
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,553
Would you like to hear a song?

1236
01:23:28,554 --> 01:23:30,642
After we make our judgment.

1237
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,306
Yes, of course.

1238
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:39,725
No, I really want to hear you sing.

1239
01:23:39,726 --> 01:23:42,256
- But after I finish my judging.
- Yes, of course.

1240
01:23:43,313 --> 01:23:50,124
I know how difficult it must be to keep
the viewers laughing with your antics.

1241
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:55,058
Since you're so funny to begin with,
to be good at cooking on top of that...

1242
01:23:55,384 --> 01:23:58,694
then people who cook for a living
would be out of jobs.

1243
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:05,347
But I feel that it's a relief that
this is the limit of your cooking talents.

1244
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:13,918
[It didn't sound like a compliment...]

1245
01:24:13,919 --> 01:24:17,868
[But Kwang Soo and John Park are
taking that comment as a compliment?]

1246
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:21,014
I don't think we have to sing anymore.

1247
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:24,313
- Are you not going to sing anymore?
- We'll sing it for you right now.

1248
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:26,095
[Time for John Park to
showcase his singing skills.]

1249
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:32,736
[The judge's 'compliment' heard
like a ray of sunshine?]

1250
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:42,331
[Automatically breaking out into a dance.]

1251
01:24:43,786 --> 01:24:47,728
[John Park's voice is
as buttery as the pork belly.]

1252
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:58,222
[The final judging is now over!]

1253
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:04,976
[Hm...]

1254
01:25:07,054 --> 01:25:09,562
[2014 Running Man Cooking Battle.]

1255
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,651
<i>Thank you everyone for all
your hard work.</i>

1256
01:25:11,652 --> 01:25:13,946
<i>We will now choose the top three.</i>

1257
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:17,393
<i>Please lift up the name tags of
the top three winners.</i>

1258
01:25:17,394 --> 01:25:21,567
<i>Once your name tags are lifted into the air,
come stand on top of the platforms.</i>

1259
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:24,662
We were pretty surprised.

1260
01:25:24,663 --> 01:25:29,480
Some of you were creative enough
for me to want to ask

1261
01:25:29,481 --> 01:25:31,461
if they thought about opening
a restaurant.

1262
01:25:31,858 --> 01:25:36,403
The love and the care you all put into
making your dishes

1263
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:38,772
were evident,
and I was very touched to see that.

1264
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:45,554
I was very touched to see how seriously you
all took this battle, which was unexpected.

1265
01:25:46,264 --> 01:25:49,450
[The amount of effort they all put into
this battle deserves to be recognized.]

1266
01:25:49,772 --> 01:25:53,077
<i>It is now time for three of
the four judges</i>

1267
01:25:53,078 --> 01:25:57,676
<i>to hold up the name tag of the winner
of your judging into the air.</i>

1268
01:25:59,435 --> 01:26:05,326
[Who will be the first team to take
place up on the platform?]

1269
01:26:12,202 --> 01:26:17,189
[Everyone's waiting for the results
with baited breath...]

1270
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:24,242
[Kim Jong Kook and Kyung Ah.]

1271
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:30,584
[Their complimenting pairing of the
chicken stew and fresh kimchi makes it!]

1272
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:32,655
Please take my reputation into
consideration.

1273
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:40,266
[Time to announce the second team.]

1274
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:44,785
[Gary and Jae Kyung.]

1275
01:26:48,599 --> 01:26:52,401
[Sanjeok made with love,
and the traditional dessert combination.]

1276
01:26:52,402 --> 01:26:54,457
Okay, there's still one spot left.

1277
01:26:55,698 --> 01:26:59,665
[Which team... will take the last spot?]

1278
01:27:10,317 --> 01:27:13,743
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyu!]

1279
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,035
No, I'm sorry.

1280
01:27:18,569 --> 01:27:21,849
[Is she getting revenge
for Ha Ha's earlier insult?]

1281
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:25,797
[The final team is,
Jae Suk and Soo Hong!]

1282

[The top three finalists.]

say this to all of you.

because I didn't know how to cook anything.</i>

1303
01:29:25,465 --> 01:29:30,171
<i>But I would really like to be able to cook
this for them with the new year upon us.</i>

1304
01:29:30,172 --> 01:29:33,670
<i>So we focused on making a healthy dish,
and that's why we chose this menu.</i>

I don't think you have
a chance anymore, Eun Hye.

1312
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:13,973
- Stop it.
