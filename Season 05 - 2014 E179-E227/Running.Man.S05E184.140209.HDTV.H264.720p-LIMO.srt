57
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,194
But for once, I think we finally have a guest
who's going to fit Jong Kook better in age.

58
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,021
You really shouldn't say anything
about age to an actress.

- This is the team I'm supposed to lead.
- Seriously.

66
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,998
Those guys with Jong Kook as their captain
is like having a dream team of our own here.

67
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,559
Why did you send Jong Kook over as
the captain to a team like that?

68

[On top of all those members,
Muscle Boy is their captain?]

69
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:24,221

of everyone on his team is In Guk.

70

- No, I don't.

74

[Is it a past that Ho Jun wants
to keep buried in secret?]

75
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,578

- I was very briefly in a boy band group.

76
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,697
- What was the name of the group?
- It was called, Tachyon.

77
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,640
- Oh, Tachyon!
- Stop playing around!

78

appearing on a variety show.]

86

00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:11,246
[In Guk, on the other hand, is blazing around
the rink like an experienced skater.]

161
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,103
Why don't you try it, Seo Joon?

162
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:22,272
[Seo Joon's completely at ease as well.
Skating like a pro!]

163
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:25,311
- This is really unfair to us.
- He's a great skater.

164
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,233
- Seo Joon's really good.
- Hey, Ha Ha!

165
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,479
[Can't let them beat us!
Team RM's Ha Ha shows off his skills.]

166
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,209
You really are short.
You're much shorter than Seo Joon.

167
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,346
[Even though his stature may be short,
he's showing off some decent skills!]

168
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,549
Who do you think should go first?

169
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,563
- This is Kwang Soo's first time.
- This is my first time.

170
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:41,973
- You want to go first?
- No, I'm saying that this is my first time.

171
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,144
- This is my first time skating too.
- Me too.

172
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,216
[Team RM is full of first time skaters.]

173
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,214
I'm going to lose my mind.
We have no hope of winning.

174
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,210
What are we supposed to do now?

175
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:57,084
The winning team will leave the ice,
and rest comfortably in a nice warm room.

176
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:01,617
The loser team will have to stop by
a grocery store...

177
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:07,374
and buy the necessary grocery items for lunch,
and while the winning team is resting.

178
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,700
The loser team will have to cook
and prepare lunch for everyone.

179
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,600
[The loser team will have to cook
and prepare lunch for the winning team.]

180
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:18,104
[Lunch menu will be determined
by the winning team.]

181
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,876
If our team ends up winning,
our team doesn't eat things like ramen.

182
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,620
- So we're going to want something healthy.
- How about some stew?

183
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,782
[They're already listing out
what they want for lunch?]

184
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,844
I want some chicken stew.

185
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:36,204
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

186
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,008
Good luck, Kwang Soo!

187
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,877
[Kwang Soo vs Ye Won.]

188
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,909
[First skating experience for both of them.]

189
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,155
[Gripping tightly onto Kwang Soo
as soon as they start off.]

190
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,481
[Ye Won isn't letting go of Kwang Soo
even as he falls onto the ice.]

191
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:09,726
- What is she doing?
- You can't hold onto him.

192
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,266
Shake her off.

193
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:14,139
[Rudolph Kwang Soo is skating full speed
on ahead with Ye Won on his back.]

194
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,858
[Giraffe sled is moving along
much faster than expected!]

195
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,872
- Let go of me!
- Good job, Ye Won!

196
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:29,270
[Suk Jin vs Baro.]

197
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:31,501
[Touching off simultaneously.]

198
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:38,872
[Immediately gets back up on his feet
to get on his way!]

199
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,095
[Baro catches up to Suk Jin
in the blink of an eye.]

200
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:55,245
[Middle aged Big-nose loses strength
in his legs midway through his lap.]

201
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,974
[Ji Hyo vs Jong Kook.]

202
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,794
You have to push his butt.

203
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,796
[Mr. Capable,
the captain of the All Star Team!]

204
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,851
[Mr. Capable blazes on ahead!]

205
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,719
[Taking the lead by more than half the rink!]

206
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:21,274
[Gary vs. Son Ho Jun]

207
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:25,133
I'm so sorry!

208
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:28,919
[Their ambition to be in the Olympics
is only getting stronger!]

209
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,484
Hurry, Ji Hyo!

210
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:33,304
[Team RM touches off.]

211
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,282
[First time skater, Gary,
catches up to Ho Jun!]

212
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:45,060
- Ho Jun.
- Ho Jun!

213
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,974
[Starting to cheat out of desperation.]

214
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,680
[But Gary quickly catches up to him again.]

215
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,516
[Even fails at his attempt to cheat.]

216
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:02,169
[Jae Suk vs In Guk.]

217
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,926
[Jae Suk quickly gets on his way.]

218
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,022
[But his opponent is Ace In Guk.]

219
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,328
- Be careful!
- No!

220
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:16,769
[Will Jae Suk get caught?
Will In Guk catch up to him?]

221
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,916
[Unable to predict the outcome of this race!]

222
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,498
[Last two skaters-
Ha Ha vs Seo Joon.]

223
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,288
[The last two skaters,
Ace of the two teams gets on their way!]

224
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:33,486
[The fate of victory...
lies in the hands of these two skaters!]

225
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,958
[Ha Ha takes the initial lead.]

226
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,853
[Haroro is the skating ace of Team RM!]

227
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,163
[A fierce battle for victory!]

228
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:52,202
[Eyes a momentary opportunity at the turn...]

229
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,405
[And Seo Joon takes the lead!]

230
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,445
[A shocking spurt of speed!]

231
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,556
[Full speed ahead... and bam!]

232
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:18,419
[How can this be!]

233
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,699
[With the finish line
right in front of his eyes...]

234
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,142
[Thanks to Seo Joon's mishap,
Team RM wins the battle!]

235
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:33,995
[A real life drama unfolding
right in front of their eyes.]

236
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,425
[Best out of three rounds-
Team RM: 1 vs Team All Star: 0.]

237
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:43,166
[What a disappointing loss...]

238
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,804
- Best out of three.
- We can do this!

239
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,427
- We can do this!
- We can win this!

240
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:50,351
- We're Running Man!
- Yes, we're Running Man!

241
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,653
Kim Jong Kook, you said you don't want
ramen? We want a ramen party!

242
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,730
I didn't think of Seo Joon's skills.
I didn't know that he'd be this bad.

243
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,064
Were you trying to be funny or something?
Tell us what happened.

244
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:03,113
- I'm not good at skating.
- Seriously?

245
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:06,065
- Why are you telling us that now?
- Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

246
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,312
Team RM wins the first round.

247
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,411
[One more win, and Team RM wins the mission!]

248
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,934
[Figuring out the order of skaters
for the second round of the race.]

249
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,798
Ho Jun.

250
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,882
While I'm still being nice...
do a better job.

251
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,163
Okay, Ho Jun?
Show them what you can do.

252
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,650
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay? Just don't fall too far behind.

253
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:24,658
[Ho Jun's determination to win is upped
after Mr. Capable's pep talk?]

254
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,024
Let's just end it with this round.

255
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,290
- Let's not bother with a third round.
- Let's go to Sochi!

256
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,504
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

257
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:35,610
I'll do it right this time instead of
skating like I don't know what I'm doing.

258
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:42,145
[His mishap during the previous round
was just a show?]

259
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:43,466
- He says he'll skate normally this time.
- Really?

260
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,871
- I'll show them what I can do this time.
- Really? Okay.

261
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,782
- Let's go!
- That was all a part of our plan.

262
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:53,673
[Getting into position as if
he knows what he's doing.]

263
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:57,195
- Maybe he really is a good skater.
- He looks like he knows what he's doing.

264
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,273
What's he doing?

265
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:03,245
[But... something seems a little off?]

266
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,335
Ho Jun, shouldn't it be your front leg
that should be standing on its toes?

267
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,221
[Ah... that's right...]

268
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,149
Ho Jun, shouldn't it be your front leg
that should be standing on its toes?

269
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,029
[He's confused as to what he needs to do
with his front and the back leg.]

270
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,906
[Could this be a part of the act too?]

271
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:26,146
[Finally ready to start the second round.]

272
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,290
[Second Round- Start!]

273
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,754
[Could Ho Jun really be a good skater?]

274
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:37,650
[Just as expected...
Ho Jun is back to his walk-skate mode.]

275
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,162
[It's still a close call between
these two weakest skaters.]

276
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,404
[Ji Hyo vs Jong Kook.]

277
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,815
[Mr. Capable catches up
to take the lead as expected.]

278
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:08,052
[But Ji Hyo still stays hot on his heels!]

279
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,114
[Huh? Team All Star's next skater is...]

280
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,041
[Am I next?]

281
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,840
[While Jong Kook is busy trying to find out
who the next skater on his team is...]

282
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,992
[Ji Hyo touches off on
Team RM's third skater, Gary!]

283
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,380
[Team All Star's third skater, Ye Won,
belatedly gets on her way.]

284
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,758
[Mr. Gary takes a big lead.]

285
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:47,024
[A huge gap between the two skaters!]

286
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:52,447
[Team RM's fourth skater, Kwang Soo,
waits in ready for his turn.]

287
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,631
[Kkuk grabs onto the Giraffe's ankle
to make him trip and fall on his face.]

288
00:18:57,227 --> 00:19:00,635
[Succeeds in buying
some time through cheating.]

289
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,941
[Giraffe gets on the way once
he gets his wherewithal back.]

290
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,433
[Ace In Guk of Team All Star is off!]

291
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,777
- Grab Kwang Soo when he comes.
- Okay.

292
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:23,793
[In Guk catches up to Kwang Soo
like a bolt of lightning.]

293
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:27,374
- Hurry, Kwang Soo!
- I'm almost there!

294
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:30,617
[Ye Won blocks Kwang Soo as planned.]

295
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:36,794
[Ace of Team All Star!
In Guk is already back at the line!]

296
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,955
[Rushing off to push Jae Suk off!]

297
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,465
[Their other ace, Seo Joon,
follows in Jae Suk's wake.]

298
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:55,123
[The two skaters are moving
full speed ahead without any hesitation.]

299
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:04,021
[But the gap between the two skaters
starts to close up...]

300
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:07,329
[And Seo Joon ultimately
catches up to Jae Suk.]

301
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:11,675
[Final skaters- Ha Ha vs Baro.]

302
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,103
[Just like the previous round,
the victory lies in their hands!]

303
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:21,774
[These two will determine which
of the two teams will claim victory!]

304
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,842
[Will it be Team RM's Ace, Haroro...]

305
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:29,048
[Or will be the Idol Muscle Boy, Baro?]

306
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:38,751
[Will he catch up to him... or not?]

307
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,679
[So close to the finish line!]

308
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:55,191
[Oh my God!]

309
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:06,211
[Thanks to Baro's tumble...
Team RM wins!]

310
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:09,288
[Team RM takes the victory!]

311
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,459
[First training round- Speed Training.
Team RM takes the win!]

312
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:19,586
[All Star Team must serve Team RM
whatever they desire for their lunch!]

313
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,712
Ramen!
I want ramen!

314
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,648
Shall we tell them to prepare a full
traditional Korean meal?

315
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,626
- How about some meat?
- I want boodae jjigae.

316
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:28,398
- Boodae jjigae?
- I like boodae jjigae.

317
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,638
Boodae jjigae?
Okay, we can do that.

318
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,708
We want boodae jjigae, and beef ribs...

319
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,360
- How about spicy pork?
- And we also want spicy chicken stew.

320
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,148
Will you be able to handle all that?

321
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,280
- I can make a really good spicy chicken stew.
- Really? Spicy chicken stew.

322
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,818
Why do you keep making things
worse for us?

323
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,498
- Why are you making all this work for us?
- Because Ho Jun needs to redeem himself.

324
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:52,827
He's trying to redeem himself
even if it's with his cooking.

325
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:58,093
Spicy chicken stew, boodae jjigae, duruchigi.
('Everything' soup, and Korean bouillabaisse.]

326
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:00,442
- Let's go and rest.
- We'll see you guys later.

327
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,405
[The winners skate out of there
for some R & R.]

328
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,512
- So this is what defeat feels like.
- I vow that we'll win the next one.

329
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,906
[All Star team has to do the grocery shopping
and the cooking as their penalty for losing.]

330
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:17,990
[Team RM heads off to a warm and cozy
dormitory to get some rest.]

331
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:20,054
- This is nice!
- It was all about teamwork.

332
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:23,461
- Everyone thought that we'd lose too.
- Gary and Ji Hyo skated very well too.

333
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,006
But... there's something that
I'm nervous about.

334
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:29,293
- Ramen is a must in boodae jjigae.
- That's a vital part of the stew.

335
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:33,480
- It's not boodae jjigae without ramen.
- Let's stop on our way and buy some ramen.

336
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:34,704
Okay.

337
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:38,487
[Preparing themselves just in case
Jong Kook doesn't buy any ramen.]

338
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,465
Can you stop the bus if you see any
convenience stores on the way?

339
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:42,806
[Doesn't leave anything to chance
when it comes to food.]

340
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,409
This is a pretty nice kitchen.
This isn't bad.

341
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,059
It's pretty nice.

342
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,941
We can't use the water in here.
The drain pipe is clogged right now.

343
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:56,454
There's a water hose outside, so that's
where you can get the water to cook.

344
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,245
[The youngest of the bunch are assigned
the task of washing everything.]

345
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,062
Chicken...
how many servings of chicken are this?

346
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,237
I'm only used to cooking one serving.

347
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:13,602
[Ho Jun is unsure of how to cook
this large of a serving portion.]

348
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:16,602
[Will he be able to pull it off?]

349
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:21,504
[Ye Won is in charge of the spicy pork.]

350
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,946
[Winner of 2014 Cooking Competition- Kkuk.]

351
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,996
[Having to wash the rice outside
in the midst of this cold winter weather...]

352
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:36,228
[Feels like a bucket of ice!]

353
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:40,156
[The sorrow is starting to seep in?]

354
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,917
I don't think it would be good
for my mother to see this.

355
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,589
[I miss you, Mommy...]

356
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,538
[Everyone who steps up to this spot
ends up screaming out in pain.]

357
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,298
- Let's turn it sideways.
- Want some more snacks?

358
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,385
Ji Hyo's really sleep deprived lately from
having to film her current drama

359
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,675
so we should just let her sleep.

360
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,187
We need her rested
if we want to win the next game.

361
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,555
Now that I know what it's like to win,
I want to win even more now.

362
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,341
If we lose the next game,
they're really going to make us pay.

363
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,493
That'll be the end of us.

364
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:27,922
How about we play this game,
and make the loser wake Ji Hyo up?

365
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,809
How about we make the loser go outside
and see how the cooking is coming along?

366
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,005
Okay, shall we do that?

367
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:39,637
[The person whose turn makes the doll
pop out of its spot loses the game.]

368
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,760
Don't think about it, and just stick it in.

369
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,765
[Yoo Jae Suk loses!]

370
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:03,407
- He's a born entertainer.
- Let's go, Kwang Soo.

371
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:06,882
[Recruits the youngest member as
punishment for suggesting the game.]

372
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,167
Go ahead.

373
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,776
[The remaining members go back
to their resting mode.]

374
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,556
- I think I want to lay down for a bit.
- How could it be the two of us?

375
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,397
What do you mean, the two of us?

376
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,408
I didn't lose that game.

377
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,572
- Garlic and onions.
- Give them everything that you need washed.

378
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,863
- Let's go.
- When will our lunch be ready?

379
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:30,787
- Is it going to be a while yet?
- Just leave us alone so that we can cook.

380
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:35,852
- Why are you mincing the garlic?
- Because I can't mince you.

381
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:42,457
- I'll go back to mincing the garlic, okay?
- Yeah... okay.

382
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,981
Hey, Kwang Soo.

383
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:46,467
- Yes, Jong Kook?
- Go rinse off the chicken, Kwang Soo.

384
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,231
- Go rinse off the chicken.
- This needs to get rinsed off.

385
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:53,610
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Kwang Soo can't do that for you.

386
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,584
- What are you talking about?
- We just need these two things rinsed off.

387
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:58,837
Okay, we'll do that
if it's just those two things.

388
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:00,749
- Hurry, Kwang Soo.
- You can do that for us, can't you?

389
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:04,398
[They may have walked in on their own,
but when they can leave is up to Mr. Capable.]

390
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,801
We'll send Suk Jin and Ha Ha
if you'll let us go.

391
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,752
- Okay, then.
- Okay. That'll be funnier anyways.

392
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:10,720
- Are you letting us off the hook then?
- Just go wash the onions, Kwang Soo.

393
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,129
No, that's not what we meant.
I don't think you understood.

394
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,827
No, I heard you and I understand.
But since you're already here anyways...

395
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:20,401
[Since you're already here,
do some work before you leave.]

396
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,295
Then Jae Suk and I'll just go and wash
these two onions for you, okay?

397
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,379
[A joint effort of washing the two onions.]

398
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,059
[They never should've came out
to see how the cooking was going...]

399
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:37,324
[Cold water in the middle of the winter?]

400
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,957
I can't fathom how cold this must be.
Having to do laundry would be awful.

401
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,798
We have to avoid having to do the laundry.
We really have to wash it here?

402
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,585
- Hey, In Guk.
- Is this where you've been doing the washing?

403
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:53,964
Wow, that's cold!

404
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,235
[Icy cold water-
Automatically screams out in pain.]

405
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,057
I'll go get the bag.

406
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:09,496
[Screams out in agony.]

407
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,777
- What's that noise outside?
- What's that noise?

408
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:19,049
That scared me.
I thought they were slaughtering a chicken.

409
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,509
- You thought a chicken was being slaughtered?
- Yes.

410
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:26,539
[It's not a chicken being slaughtered,
but it's a giraffe.]

411
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:31,509
[Almost lost his voice
from having had to wash the onion.]

412
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,786
- Wow, that was so cold.
- That was amazing.

413
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:41,994
[Looking up spicy chicken stew recipes.]

414
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:51,726
[Ho Jun's chicken stew is
starting to take shape.]

415
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:02,356
[Adds the minced garlic to the spicy pork.]

416
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,721
What are you doing?

417
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,728
[Poured over half the bag of sugar
into the egg roll up mixture.]

418
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:15,136
[Chef Ye Won's method of measuring.]

419
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,053
Why did you pour in so much sugar?

420
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,867
[Not listening...]

421
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,087
Why don't you try cooking it now?

422
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:26,753
I think we need to see
how it turns out in the pan.

423
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,941
[Chef Ye Won's spicy pork dish
is nearing completion.]

424
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:43,090
[Bay top shell is almost ready too.]

425
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:53,614
- This is the frozen kind.
- Frozen instant boodae jjigae.

426
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,228
[Frozen instant boodae jjigae
is ready as well.]

427
00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:01,361
- Do we have to add any water to this?
- Yes, 750ml... so we need to add 1,500ml.

428
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:05,263
Let's do better with the next game so that
we don't have to do the laundry.

429
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:08,016
- Let's not do the laundry.
- There's no way we can do the laundry.

430
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:12,291
[Spicy chicken stew and boodae jjigae
is nearing completion.]

431
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:15,967
- When are we ever going to get to eat?
- Baro.

432
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:18,955
- Baro, can we eat soon?
- We're almost done.

433
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,367
What's taking you guys so long?
You guys are working so hard.

434
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,559
- Thanks for the hard work, Baro.
- Want me to wash that for you?

435
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,949
- Yes.
- You do?

436
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,545
Okay.

437
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:30,527
[Why... did you ask that?]

438
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:33,349
- Wow, it smells really good in here.
- Wow.

439
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,889
[Exhausted from having to wait,
the winning team heads into the kitchen.]

440
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,256
- Everyone is saying how good your food is.
- It smells really good in here.

441
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:43,410
Wow, thanks for everyone's hard work.

442
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:48,677
Jae Suk, stop standing around,
and go set the table.

443
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,387
[Kkuk puts him back to work
as soon as he lays his eyes on him.]

444
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:56,075
- I'm sorry, but did you not make the jjigae?
- We did make it. It's simmering over here.

445
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:57,772
Don't you see it simmering over here?

446
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:00,812
- Did you forget the ramen?
- Did you not put any ramen in there?

447
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:05,065
- Where is the ramen?
- Sorry to ask, but did you not put any...

448
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,810
There's no ramen in there.

449
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:10,835
I don't like it. I don't like ramen,
so I didn't put any in there.

450
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:12,349
- Jae Suk.
- How can you not put any ramen in there?

451
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,769
We had a feeling you might do that,
so we bought some.

452
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:19,750
[Bought the ramen themselves from
the convenience store earlier.]

453
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,209
[Team RM was right on with their prediction.]

454
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:29,890
[It's enough to make their mouths water.]

455
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,728
You're all much better cooks
than I had thought you'd be.

456
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:39,357
- What are you doing?
- You have to put ramen in there.

457
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:42,439
- Take it out.
- You have to add ramen in there.

458
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,985
- I'm going to take it back out.
- What are you talking about?

459
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:48,209
How can you have boodae jjigae
without ramen in there?

460
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,373
Add more ramen in there, Jae Suk.

461
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:52,625
Do what you have to do
to get the ramen in there.

462
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:54,873
- Are we done?
- Yes, we're all done.

463
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:56,572
Here it comes.

464
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,214
Watch out for the boodae jjigae.
Look at that spicy chicken stew.

465
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:02,440
Thank you for the delicious meal.

466
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:06,382
[Thank you for the delicious lunch.]

467
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,304
This soup is amazing with the ramen in it.

468
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,967
[Boodae jjigae and ramen
is a match made in heaven]

469
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,264
The broth is really refreshing.
It almost has a seafood stew flavor to it.

470
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:17,051
You put way too much ramen in there.
Look at that mess.

471
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:20,458
- Get all the ramen out of there.
- Other people behind me want some too.

472
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:24,104
[People behind him want some ramen too...]

473
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,874
- Wow, this all looks so good.
- This is all so good.

474
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,708
- Thanks for a delicious meal!
- Thank you!

475
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,814
It's delicious!
It really is tasty.

476
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,254
- Can I get some Americano when we're done?
- You brew your own Americano!

477
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,356
That's a very hot tempered young man.

478
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:42,727
[This is a hot tempered
young man's restaurant.]

479
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:44,536
Who made the spicy chicken stew?

480
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:45,697
Is it pretty good?

481
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:50,716
[It seems as though Ho Jun's dish
is a huge success!]

482
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,739
Hey, Ho Jun. If you're this good at cooking,
I wonder how good you'll be with laundry.

483
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,884
- I can't wait to see your laundry skills.
- You did a great job.

484
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,005
[Strength training on concentration skills.]

485
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:12,147
[Arrives at the next training arena.]

486
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,634
[A brook still frozen over with ice.]

487
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,914
- Is this it?
- What are we going to be doing here?

488
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:23,763
[What kind of a training session
awaits them here?]

489
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:26,284
They want us to just go in.

490
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,792
We have to make sure to win this time.

491
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:34,742
[Just what... could it be?]

492
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:36,931
What is this?
What do they want us to do here?

493
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,943
We have to stand with our
own team members.

494
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,926
[Captain of the All Star Team
is standing with the Team RM members.]

495
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:47,637
- Think about what you're doing.
- I forgot that we're on separate teams.

496
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:48,972
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:52,509
I'd like to welcome everyone to your second
round of Hell Training Camp.

498
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,418
[Second round of Hell Training Camp.]

499
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,516
[Strength training on concentration skills.]

500
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:00,938
- Do you see the two tables behind you?
- Yes.

501
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,682
- You have to go into the brook...
- What?

502
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,851
- We have to go in there?
- Go into the stream.

503
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:16,560
You have to get a rock from the stream,
and build a six-rock tower on the table.

504
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:22,022
- This was designed to help you focus better.
- It's the middle of the winter.

505
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:26,420
- You'll be doing it while barefoot.
- How is that related to our ability to focus?

506
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,086
You'll find out once you start the mission.

507
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,603
The mission will be done as a relay course.

508
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:34,067
If the third person topples the tower over,
then do we have to start over again?

509
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:37,007
- No, the third person will have to fix it.
- Okay, start over with that person.

510
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,378
[If the tower topples over, then the person
responsible for toppling it must fix it.]

511
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:43,162
Please take off all your shoes and socks,
and put them in the yellow basket.

512
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:45,236
[Confiscating all their socks and shoes.]

513
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:48,082
The team that loses this round...

514
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,889
will have to do laundry with water
that is a bit colder than this brook water.

515
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,771
- There's no way I want to do that.
- We have to win this round.

516
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:54,737
I really don't want to do it.

517
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:57,263
- This is no joke.
- I know.

518
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:04,164
[Just having to be barefoot alone is
enough to make them break out in screams.]

519
00:34:13,414 --> 00:34:15,520
Whatever.

520
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:22,912
[A long and arduous journey to
become the best of the best.]

521
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,309
- Okay, I'm all set.
- My feet are freezing!

522
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:30,804
Fighting!
No laundry for us!

523
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:35,122
[Ready]

524
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:40,120
[Frigid icy water? No problem.]

525
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,484
[Refreshing beyond their wildest imagination?]

526
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:17,201
[Ho Jun moves forward by avoiding the snow
by stepping on the rocks.]

527
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:25,595
[Picks out a big flat rock
easier for building.]

528
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,570
Don't think about getting in his way,
and just pick out a rock of your own!

529
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,604
[Kwang Soo chooses a rock of his own.]

530
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:40,559
[All Star team completes the first tier.]

531
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:46,593
[It's a relay race, so he
must return quickly back to his team.]

532
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:49,607
[But he doesn't have the courage
to go back.]

533
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:53,411
[The next players are anxiously waiting.]

534
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:05,047
[Ho Jun touches off with In Guk.]

535
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:12,173
[Automatically turns back around.]

536
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,668
That's no joke!

537
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,956
[Kwang Soo in the meantime
arrives back to his own teammates.]

538
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:23,685
[Touches off with Jae Suk.]

539
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:31,835
[Automatically turns back around
as soon as they step foot on the snow.]

540
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:45,892
[Must endure the pain if they want to
become the national representatives!]

541
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,851
[Jae Suk turns back around!]

542
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:57,405
[In Guk picks up the first rock
his hand falls on.]

543
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:59,894
[Lays down the second tier.]

544
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:02,357
That rock is too round!

545
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:04,657
You have to swap it out for a flatter one.

546
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:08,199
[Swapping out the rock
as told by captain Kkuk.]

547
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,034
[Team RM swaps out their players.]

548
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:13,446
[Suk Jin heads out as the second player.]

549
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,005
Hurry, In Guk!

550
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,043
I can't do it!

551
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:21,429
I really want to go back too,
but I just can't do it!

552
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,545
[Suk Jin forges on ahead with
a rock in his hand.]

553
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:34,488
[All Star Team completes their second tier.]

554
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,552
Good job.
Our tower is perfect so far.

555
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,620
- Hurry back!
- Just run!

556
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,365
[Team RM barely manages to
complete their second tier as well.]

557
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,388
You need to place it steadier than that!

558
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:51,931
It's all about sacrifice.
You know how it is.

559
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:54,500
[In Guk loudly makes his return.]

560
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:57,544
[Third player, Seo Joon gets on his way.]

561
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,439
[But...]

562
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,362
[His steps are so strong and steady.]

563
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:14,171
[Does Seo Joon not feel the cold?
No, doubt that!]

564
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:17,248
Hurry, Seo Joon.

565
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:24,233
[But he endures the pain,
and moves steadily on ahead.]

566
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,242
Is Seo Joon not even fazed?

567
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,388
[Ha Ha from Team RM gets on his way!]

568
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:43,823
[Calmly... completes the third tier.]

569
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,564
Seo Joon lost his ability to speak.

570
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:50,804
[Silent... Ice Prince.]

571
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,362
[The Ice Prince finally says something
at the end of his silence.]

572
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,746
[Shout of agony from all the pain
that he's just had to endure.]

573
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,977
- Is this good?
- Yeah, that's good.

574
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,537
- Dong Hoon!
- Hurry back, Dong Hoon.

575
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:09,143
You have to hurry back!

576
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,446
What kind of a rock is that?

577
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:16,189
[Team RM's third tier has zero stability.]

578
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:18,469
My turn?

579
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,305
[Captain Kkuk's turn.]

580
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:24,362
[Seo Joon may have started out manly,
but he returns screaming and crying.]

581
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:27,568
[Captain Kkuk's turn to head out.]

582
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:36,351
[You think you won't feel the cold
just because you're Mr. Capable?]

583
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,638
That's a good one.

584
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,240
[Finds a large flat rock at once!]

585
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:49,186
[Jae Suk finally gets on his way.]

586
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,910
Anything is better than
having to do the laundry.

587
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:56,998
[The All Star Team completes
their fourth tier.]

588
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:04,914
- You have to get the rock, Jae Suk!
- Hurry up and get it!

589
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:06,454
Get the rock!

590
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:10,242
Don't sit down and just come back.

591
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:11,651
[What?]

592
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,395
Just come back, Jong Kook.

593
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:19,134
[Captain and the teammates are all alike
in their intensity...]

594
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,669
Hurry up!

595
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:24,549
I don't see any rocks.

596
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,016
- I can't find any rocks.
- What do you mean? They're all around you!

597
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:29,837
[Rocks are all over the place...]

598
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:32,230
We've got two tiers left to go.
We've only got two left to go, right?

599
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:33,954
[All Star Team wins if they can finish
two more tiers!]

600
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:36,803
- Wow, this is no joke.
- Is it my turn?

601
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,839
[Ye Won's turn.]

602
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:49,073
[Ye Won is given special permission
to do the mission with her leggings on.]

603
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,452
Hurry, Ye Won!

604
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:53,159
[Team RM barely manages to
complete their fourth tier.]

605
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,189
[All Star Team is already finished
with their fifth tier.]

606
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:01,172
[One more tier, and All Star Team wins!]

607
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,816
[The last player of the group, Baro,
gets on his way!]

608
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:14,397
[Baro is struggling to forge ahead.]

609
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:20,559
- You go first, Gary.
- Me? You want me to go first?

610
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,135
- Hurry up and go, Gary!
- You want me to go first?

611
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,106
Don't think about anything.
Don't think about anything!

612
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,316
Don't think about anything!
We have to win this!

613
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:33,287
[Victory must be ours!
Gary tries talking himself out of the pain.]

614
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:36,009
Okay, let's not think about anything!

615
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,947
- You're not in pain!
- Just think about winning the game!

616
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:41,728
[Gary is forging ahead
without any hesitation.]

617
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:45,187
- Don't' think about anything.
- You're not in any pain, Gary!

618
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:48,739
That's right.
Just think about winning, Kang Gary!

619
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:59,479
[Team RM's tower ultimately topples over.]

620
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:04,447
No!

621
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:10,131
[Even at the briefest glance,
these are not stackable rocks.]

622
00:42:12,103 --> 00:42:15,419
[All Star Team on the other hand
completes building their tower.]

623
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:21,977
- How am I supposed to do this?
- We won!

624
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:28,005
[Round one- All Star Team wins!]

625
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,260
[Best out of three-
Team RM: 0 vs All Star Team: 1.]

626
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:35,835
[Quite a crowd of fans have gathered around.]

627
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:40,189
All Star Team won the first round.

628
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,718
If the All Star Team wins this round too,
then they win the game.

629
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,653
- Are you all very cold right now?
- Yes.

630
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:49,977
The second round will be played
with only three players.

631
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:51,267
Just three people.

632
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,830
- It's over if we win this round.
- That's right.

633
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:57,870
- But if we lose, then we have to play again?
- That's right.

634
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:59,263
- We have to finish it.
- Yes, we have to end it now.

635
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,159
[Team RM's players- Gary, Ji Hyo and Ha Ha.]

636
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,312
[All Star Team- In Guk, Jong Kook, and Baro.]

637
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,557
A round of applause!

638
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:17,099
[Second game of Hell Training Camp.]

639
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,507
[Second round- Go!]

640
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:22,957
You're doing great, Ji Hyo.

641
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:26,442
[Ace Blank Ji gets on her way
without any hesitation.]

642
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:31,599
[Baro is moving slower than
expected of him.]

643
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,652
[Team RM completes their first tier while
Baro is still busy searching for his rock.]

644
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,236
[All Star Team follows immediately behind
with the completion of their own tier.]

645
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:51,244
[That's our Ace! Leading with
a huge gap between the two teams.]

646
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,336
[Second player for Team RM- Ha Ha.]

647
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:00,464
Hurry.
Get back up here.

648
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,532
[Captain Kkuk is on his way!]

649
00:44:10,174 --> 00:44:12,154
[Catches up to the other team
in the blink of an eye.]

650
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:18,648
[But while Captain Kkuk is busy
swapping out his rock...]

651
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:20,928
[The gap between the two teams
widens again.]

652
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:22,880
[Final player for Team RM- Gary.]

653
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,847
[Touches off with the final player, In Guk.]

654
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:35,376
[While Gary walks on precariously...]

655
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:37,534
[In Guk forges full speed ahead.]

656
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,066
[They both arrives at their own table
simultaneously.]

657
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,192
[They just need to complete the final tier.]

658
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:52,991
[Just who... will come out the winner?]

659
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,488
[In Guk was faster!]

660
00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:06,490
[All Star Team wins two rounds in a row!]

661
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:10,172
[Final score-
Team RM: 0 vs All Star Team: 2.]

662
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,330
Come on, Gary!

663
00:45:16,331 --> 00:45:18,905
[All Star Team has redeemed themselves from
their defeat at the short track game.]

664
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,233
Let's do best out of five!

665
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:27,399
- Let's do best out of five!
- No way!

666
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:30,558
[Adamantly refuses.]

667
00:45:32,953 --> 00:45:34,643
Please, I beg of you!

668
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,086
Let's do best out of five!

669
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:45,821
- I'm sorry, but there's no way.
- Best out of five!

670
00:45:52,581 --> 00:45:55,836
[Trying to convince them with
the help from the crowd.]

671
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:57,984
Enough!

672
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:59,995
[Kwang Soo... that's enough now.]

673
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:07,044
The All Star Team can go back to the basecamp
and rest in the warm room.

674
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,360
[It's the All Star Team's turn to rest!]

675
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:14,046
[Result of their phenomenal teamwork.]

676
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:18,871
[The two teams' situation has
turned 180 degrees.]

677
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,909
[Team RM must now do
the laundry as penalty for their defeat.]

678
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,527
Is there no hot water?

679
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,381
Look at that huge pile.

680
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:39,783
- I'm too scared to even start.
- Do we have to put them all in there first?

681
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:44,234
What's wrong?

682
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,242
- What's it like?
- Dip your hand in the water.

683
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:50,228
The water must be practically frozen over.

684
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,202
[The cold temperature of the water
only draws out their laughter of disbelief.]

685
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:57,514
Laughter of disbelief is all I can manage.

686
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,466
[Time to start the laundry.]

687
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,330
No, I'll do the rinsing.

688
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:08,007
No, don't do it.
I don't want you to do that.

689
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,887
His idea of rinsing is
just swishing it around half heartedly.

690
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,940
- What's wrong with how I do it?
- No, nerve mind.

691
00:47:19,124 --> 00:47:21,054
Even the soap feels like a block of ice.

692
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:23,693
- I think the soap is frozen solid.
- Seriously?

693
00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:25,800
- The soap feels like ice.
- Here, Gary.

694
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,232
This is driving me crazy.

695
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:34,964
[Their screams turn into
laughter of disbelief.]

696
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:44,096
The clothes are going to freeze into
blocks of ice if we hang them up to dry.

697
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:47,466
Why would you want us to wash these now,
and hang them up to dry this late at night?

698
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:49,843
Whose shirt is this?

699
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:53,234
Why did you leave this on here?

700
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:57,825
Wow, this is unbelievably cold.

701
00:47:57,826 --> 00:48:00,283
How can they expect us to do this out here
in the middle of winter?

702
00:48:00,284 --> 00:48:02,047
Can't they just put it in the washer?

703
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,421
- We'll give you a few more pairs of gloves.
- Yes, please!

704
00:48:08,274 --> 00:48:10,972
- The gloves don't even make a difference.
- It makes no difference right now.

705
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:13,196
Suk Jin's lying to you.
It's much better.

706
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:20,214
[Four years of having to deal with
Suk Jin's devious schemes.]

707
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:23,415
It's much better.

708
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:26,930
[Just then, PD Hwan Jin comes out
carrying a basket full of laundry.]

709
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:32,760
[All the towels that they used
by the brook earlier during the game.]

710
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,098
You should be thankful that
you had the use of these towels.

711
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,915
[That was earlier...]

712
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,970
- We'll never finish all this.
- Hello!

713
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,470
- What are you guys doing?
- What's in that basket?

714
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:47,421
This is our laundry.

715
00:48:49,348 --> 00:48:52,381
[All the clothes and socks that they wore
during the previous game.]

716
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:54,235
Where would you like for me
to put this?

717
00:48:54,236 --> 00:48:56,483
- Just stack them over there.
- Over here?

718
00:48:57,988 --> 00:49:00,425
- Thanks for doing our laundry.
- Okay.

719
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:02,522
You have to wash it and give it
back to us.

720
00:49:02,986 --> 00:49:05,538
Don't be too rough with them either.

721
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:08,673
Okay, Baro.

722
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:10,698
- Make sure to wring all the water out.
- Okay, we got it.

723
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,762
See you later, Baro.
Don't worry about a thing.

724
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:15,310
That Baro has no fear of his older brothers.

725
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,938
He always says whatever's on his mind.

726
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:20,404
[He says whatever's on his mind
because he's Baro?]

727
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,894
I have a feeling that
he's going to make it big.

728
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:31,174
It's warm water.

729
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,030
[Giraffe discovers a pot of warm water.]

730
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:37,351
Is this all the hot water you have?

731
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:44,830
- Can I take this with me? Thank you.
- Sure.

732
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:51,850
You know why?

733
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:53,337
To reassure us.

734
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,876
- Just trying to reassure us.
- Is that a pot of warm water?

735
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,113
No, it's just some liquid detergent.

736
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:02,984
- That's warm water, isn't it?
- No, it's detergent.

737
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,393
- It's just detergent.
- Come here.

738
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:08,208
We're all cold out here,
and look at how hard Ji Hyo's working.

739
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,168
- I just got some detergent.
- Let me see.

740
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:19,494
[Rids the evidence now that
he's been caught in his lie.]

741
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:23,283
[The precious warm water...]

742
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:25,834
How can you be so awful?

743
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:29,634
- That precious water.
- What a waste of the precious water.

744
00:50:31,636 --> 00:50:34,426
We could've warmed up our hands
whenever our hands got too cold.

745
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:36,855
- We could've used it together.
- Get out of here!

746
00:50:39,626 --> 00:50:43,656
[I really must be a fool.]

747
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:49,918
[It's a karaoke party in the cozy room.]

748
00:51:09,078 --> 00:51:12,046
[Perfectly in sync even when they're playing.]

749
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,111
[This is the ease felt by the victors.]

750
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,085
Everyone together!

751
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,845
- It's hot water!
- So warm!

752
00:51:28,846 --> 00:51:30,663
[We love you, warm water!]

753
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:35,169
[Big-nose Brother rushes over
to the hot water.]

754
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,151
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

755
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:40,048
I guess I shouldn't have butted in there.

756
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:45,234
[Monday Couple is seen
wringing out the clothes together.]

757
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,894
[Playing out the scene of a clueless idiot.]

758
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:49,694
Here, let me do that.

759
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,078
I'm going to take the next semester off.

760
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:01,458
- These are Kim Jong Kook's pants.
- We're not washing that.

761
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,495
- No, we're not washing his.
- Take it.

762
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,843
You have to take it.

763
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,893
- Let's just lay them out.
- Let's lay them out without washing them.

764
00:52:08,894 --> 00:52:10,699
It's already clean.

765
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:16,231
[Your sin is having met the wrong owner...]

766
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:19,935
[Slowly finishing up with the laundry.]

767
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,959
I wonder if we even got the clothes clean.

768
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:26,903
Even though we all did our best...

769
00:52:26,904 --> 00:52:30,911
- Then they can just rewash them at home.
- Yes, you're right.

770
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:34,959
These clothes are like dried fish.
Frozen, then dried... frozen then dried again.

771
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:37,912
Jong Kook's pants are the only ones
that are still nice and fluffy.

772
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:41,743
[Of course they'd still be fluffy
since they were never even washed.]

773
00:52:42,822 --> 00:52:47,133
- Look at how frozen this is.
- I can see icicles hanging off of them.

774
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:49,542
[All the laundry they just did
is already frozen.]

775
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,357
- This is the only thing that isn't frozen.
- Jong Kook's are nice and dry.

776
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:00,265
We're done!

777
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:06,627
- You had to do it with soap?
- We didn't even have detergent.

778
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:10,161
[The two teams are back together again.]

779
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:12,082
You can just take these back right now.

780
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:16,191
- You can take the socks back like this.
- I see my pants over there.

781
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,360
[Jong Kook discovers his own pants.]

782
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:21,342
Why are my pants different from
the others?

783
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:24,182
- Did you not wash my pants?
- Come on now!

784
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:30,124
- Of course, we washed them.
- You didn't wash my pants!

785
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:35,229
You didn't wash mine.
Only the part I got wet earlier is frozen.

786
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,787
All the other areas are still soft.

787
00:53:40,103 --> 00:53:43,374
- It's because we dried them by the furnace.
- What furnace?

788
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,670
[What furnace...]

789
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:51,512
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You guys are all awful.

790
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:56,023
[The rivalry between these two teams is
getting fiercer by the minute.]

791
00:53:56,024 --> 00:54:00,854
[What's the next round of training
that awaits these two teams?]

792
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,160
[Intense Teamwork Training.]

793
00:54:09,603 --> 00:54:13,192
[Evening training course for
2014 Running Winter Olympics?]

794
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:15,300
[A snow field?]

795
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:16,816
- It looks like a track field.
- What is this?

796
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,946
They're all fast runners.

797
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:24,669
Baro is a 12 second sprinter.

798
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,970
[Baro's 100m dash record is 12 seconds.]

799
00:54:27,928 --> 00:54:29,572
This is going to be fun!

800
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,788
- Are you all rested?
- Yes.

801
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:38,990
Your next training mission is designed to see
how you work together as a team.

802
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:43,208
This training session is what our national
soccer team does in their real training camp.

803
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:45,540
All members of each team must sit in a row

804
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:50,119
and scoot along the line while holding
onto the feet of the person behind them.

805
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:53,842
You must do a lap around the field
while maintaining that position.

806
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:56,377
That training session?
You want us to do that here?

807
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:59,611
That's the same training session that our
national team does during their own training.

808
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,220
[Only difference here is that it's being
done on a snow field.]

809
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:08,583
This is all about survival of the fittest.

810
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:12,087
Baro's 12 second record has no use here.

811
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:16,357
Baro's record doesn't matter here.
Even Usain Bolt can't do this.

812
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:18,282
This is something Ho Jun could
be good at.

813
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:21,602
[Their black hole, Ho Jun...]

814
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,412
Okay, everyone sit down.

815
00:55:24,413 --> 00:55:26,581
[Jumping right into coaching segment.]

816
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,550
Set, go!
One, two, okay?

817
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:33,998
[Practicing along Coach Kkuk's command.]

818
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:39,639
Ready, set, go.
Left, right...

819
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,246
Can we go a little slower?

820
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:47,762
[Kkuk's power walking.]

821
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:53,800
Right... left... right... left...

822
00:55:54,457 --> 00:55:57,669
[Everyone's getting painfully dragged along
to Kkuk's pace.]

823
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:03,891
Okay, we got it.

824
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:05,746
That's a nice pace.

825
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:07,685
What are you doing?
That's a good pace.

826
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:09,649
What are you doing?
What are you doing!

827
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:16,631
[This is Coach Kkuk's hard training
that they'd all only heard about.]

828
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:22,718
[Meanwhile...]

829
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:28,886
You can't do it like that, Suk Jin.

830
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:32,423
[Elder Big-nose is struggling
right from the get go.]

831
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,201
- Suk Jin can't do this.
- Set, go.

832
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:36,684
- One, two...
- Why aren't we moving?

833
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,005
[Making no progress.]

834
00:56:40,006 --> 00:56:42,231
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

835
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,235
- Try getting up, Suk Jin.
- I can't do this.

836
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:47,835
[Tries it again without Suk Jin in tow.]

837
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:50,598
- One, two...
- Keep moving.

838
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:53,555
Why am I not moving?
I'm not moving!

839
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:59,213
[Gary at the tail end
isn't moving from his spot.]

840
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:00,890
Why aren't you guys moving up?

841
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:04,323
Listen... let's do this two against two.

842
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,554
Why do you want to keep
switching around?

843
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,714
He's already used up all his strength.

844
00:57:10,686 --> 00:57:13,340
[Big-nose is exhausted from
having done all the laundry.]

845
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:15,859
- Suk Jin's already exhausted.
- He had to do all that laundry.

846
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,688
I feel like my muscles have exploded.

847
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:21,057
[All his muscles has exploded
from the load of laundry?]

848
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,185
How about two against two relay?

849
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:27,043
[Four representatives from each team
to do a relay of two on two.]

850
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,491
Okay, then we're good.

851
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:33,549
[The laundry is freezing along nicely...]

852
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:37,483
Gary, and Ha Ha!
Let's win this race!

853
00:57:37,484 --> 00:57:39,147
[Gary and Ha Ha vs Baro and In Guk.]

854
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:41,641
[Jong Kook and Seo Joon vs
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.]

855
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:43,373
Why is Ho Jun sitting out?

856
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,055
[Excuse me?]

857
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,659
Ho Jun says that snow isn't his thing.

858
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,353
[What a unique excuse.
Snow isn't his thing?]

859
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,658
You and I are cut from the same cloth.

860
00:57:56,637 --> 00:57:58,907
He's the race starter for your team.

861
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,391
- How can you say that?
- Fighting!

862
00:58:01,392 --> 00:58:03,383
[I make a good cheerleader.]

863
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,151
This is no big deal.
This isn't hard.

864
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:08,836
So let's all do this, okay?

865
00:58:11,063 --> 00:58:12,075
Let's do this!

866
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:16,257
You all know that the penalty for losing this
is to chop up all the firewood.

867
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:18,771
The winning team can go into the room,
and rest in the meantime.

868
00:58:18,772 --> 00:58:20,189
We're going to win this!

869
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:23,185
[Start the race!]

870
00:58:27,877 --> 00:58:31,287
[It's a neck to neck start!]

871
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:43,205
[Both teams are perfectly in sync
with their own teammate.]

872
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:46,587
[Just then...]

873
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:50,265
[All Star Team starts taking the lead.]

874
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:55,435
[Must touch off for the next players
to get on their way.]

875
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:57,645
[All Star Team is almost there!]

876
00:58:57,646 --> 00:59:00,895
[But... Team RM touches off first!]

877
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:05,994
[Team RM has better timing,
and gets to start off first!]

878
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:12,097
[All Star Team rushes off in their wake.]

879
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,638
[They're so fast...]

880
00:59:32,585 --> 00:59:34,914
[The amazing Yoo-Lee Duo.]

881
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:41,754
[Team RM wins!]

882
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,117
[How can this be?]

883
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:53,567
[Totally unexpected!
The All Star Team was the favored winner!]

884
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:55,201
They're so fast!

885
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:57,917
- We got this!
- You guys did great!

886
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:04,983
[Time for Coach Kkuk's
additional coaching session.]

887
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:06,869
Why are you guys practicing so much?

888
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,258
This is why Seo Joon's struggling
and exhausted already.

889
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:12,682
- Jong Kook... can we please stop?
- Come on, Seo Joon!

890
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:18,622
- You need to keep going, Seo Joon.
- All the strength from the earlier meal is gone.

891
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:21,341
What's so difficult about this, Seo Joon?

892
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,358
No one on our team can keep up
with you and your strength.

893
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,151
I'm not even warmed up yet!

894
01:00:29,152 --> 01:00:30,902
I'm the normal one here.

895
01:00:30,903 --> 01:00:33,558
- I'm the normal one of the two of us.
- Let's do better this time.

896
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:36,510
- Okay?
- You're going to kill these guys.

897
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:40,096
[Kkuk's training sessions are about to make
these 'normal' guys keel over in exhaustion.]

898
01:00:40,097 --> 01:00:41,676
You're not really training for Sochi!

899
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:42,969
Here's how I honestly
feel about this situation.

900
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:46,030
Even if we do lose this game,
I think wood chopping will be good for us.

901
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:52,491
- I don't want to do this!
- This is just exercise.

902
01:00:52,492 --> 01:00:56,897
[Coach Kkuk is thinking that wood chopping
could be his evening workout?]

903
01:00:56,898 --> 01:00:58,271
That could be a really good
workout for us.

904
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:03,825
Look at how happy and excited Jong Kook is
about the thought of teaching you something.

905
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,605
You have to stop thinking
that you're the norm!

906
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:11,235
We have to raise the bar on what our people
think is the normal exercise routine.

907
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:14,767
[Does he want to send every citizen of
the nation to the Olympics?]

908
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:16,140
We have to raise the bar.

909
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:18,117
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

910
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:21,351
[Second round- Go!]

911
01:01:23,651 --> 01:01:26,593
[Their speed is noticeably faster!]

912
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:30,819
[All Star Team is pulling far ahead
of their opponents!]

913
01:01:34,105 --> 01:01:37,532
[It seems as though all the nagging
by their coach is having its effect.]

914
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:42,767
[Team RM is doing their best
to catch up to the other team.]

915
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,113
[But the gap is already too great.]

916
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:49,038
[Second bout of players from
All Star Team gets on their way!]

917
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,214
[Team RM finally touches off.]

918
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:03,145
[Oh... oh?]

919
01:02:04,694 --> 01:02:06,999
[Yoo-Lee Duo is doing it again!]

920
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:11,412
No!

921
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:19,262
[The gap is closing fast!]

922
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,694
[Please...]

923
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,818
[Almost caught up to them!]

924
01:02:31,557 --> 01:02:34,561
[The finish line is right in
front of their eyes!]

925
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:38,579
Just a little bit more!

926
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:46,517
[Which of the two teams will cross
the finish line first?]

927
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:57,634
[Team RM's unbelievable victory!]

928
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:06,026
What are you doing, Jong Kook!

929
01:03:06,027 --> 01:03:07,893
[All Star Team is relegated to
wood chopping duty.]

930
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:16,446
You exhausted him from making him
practice over and over.

931
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:20,763
I'd win the gold medal if this game was
accepted as an official game at the Olympics!

932
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:25,198
[Team RM's spirits are up high
from their thrilling victory.]

933
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:31,445
[They're all really leaving the field without
even a glance back at their opposing team.]

934
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:35,439
You should've held on tighter
to my feet.

935
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:38,589
My arms kept flailing around like this
when I was holding onto your feet.

936
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:42,795
[Unable to handle
the force of 'The Kkuk Train'.]

937
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:46,347
- All I kept hearing was your screaming.
- You're too strong for any one of us.

938
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:48,397
I'm missing my mom more and more.

939
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:54,295
Wow, seriously...
Anyways, let's not think of this as a penalty.

940
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,201
Let's all have fun and get some exercise.

941
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:03,187
Let's just think of it as getting a workout,
and let's go!

942
01:04:03,188 --> 01:04:04,734
Let's go chop up some wood.

943
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:07,504
All that?

944
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:09,186
Is that even possible?

945
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,176
Why doesn't Jong Kook, as the team captain,
give everyone else a demonstration?

946
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:15,484
I can't believe how fitting
that ax looks on him.

947
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:17,514
My goodness.

948
01:04:17,515 --> 01:04:19,869
He's like an expert in this.
You're not certified in it, are you?

949
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:21,775
Okay, I'll give it a try.

950
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:23,461
I don't know if I can get it in one try.

951
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:25,673
Wow, he's like a Spartan.

952
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:36,368
This is... this is pretty simple.
It's not that hard.

953
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,497
[Splits the wood right in half!]

954
01:04:41,047 --> 01:04:42,770
This one looks tough.
I don't think I'll be able to get this.

955
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:45,818
You have to aim it just right.

956
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:53,183
[He's an expert at this!]

957
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:58,689
[Kkuk is demonstrating the task
perfectly for his teammates.]

958
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,900
[Baro tries his hand at the task.]

959
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,566
I'm not sure where to hit it.

960
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,811
You have to swing down strong,
and let the ax fall where it falls.

961
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:14,530
[It's his first time doing this...]

962
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:23,556
You're playing around right now,
aren't you?

963
01:05:23,557 --> 01:05:25,293
[Wood chopping isn't an easy job
to pick up for newbies...]

964
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:27,835
[Kkuk to demonstrate the task again.]

965
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:38,401
[Are you really human?]

966
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:44,643
You have to follow it through.
Follow through where the ax falls.

967
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:47,124
There you go!

968
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:48,903
There you go!

969
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:51,328
[Even he himself is shocked.]

970
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:53,016
Wait, let me try another one.

971
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:54,555
I have to figure this out
while I've got the feel for it.

972
01:05:54,556 --> 01:05:56,465
Out of the way.
Others are waiting for their turn.

973
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,101
Be honest, Jong Kook.
You're having fun right now, aren't you?

974
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:03,469
- You're really excited, aren't you?
- To be honest, I really wanted to chop wood.

975
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:07,600
[The wood chopping mania finally reveals
his true desire to chop some wood.]

976
01:06:08,754 --> 01:06:10,374
It's Ho Jun's turn.
At least, it's Ho Jun's turn.

977
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,048
[At last,
it's their Dark Horse, Ho Jun's turn.]

978
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:13,862
You want me to pick
a really easy one for you?

979
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:17,530
To be honest, I did a lot of wood chopping
when I was younger.

980
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,698
- Really?
- Yeah.

981
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:20,594
Then I bet you'll be really good at it.

982
01:06:20,595 --> 01:06:22,592
- He knows how to chop wood?
- I can chop it down the middle, right?

983
01:06:22,593 --> 01:06:24,422
- Sure, of course.
- Wow, I didn't know.

984
01:06:33,044 --> 01:06:37,361
[We thought that perhaps...
but as expected...]

985
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:40,202
What's your problem?
Try it again.

986
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:42,966
- Go on and try it again.
- I don't know why that didn't work.

987
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,248
[Could it have been a mistake?
Giving it another try.]

988
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:48,037
[Misses his mark?]

989
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:54,913
Step back.
Step back!

990
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:58,787
How many times must you try?

991
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:09,118
How many attempts does it take?
You're hurting the wood!

992
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:11,587
You should've done it in one strike.

993
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:13,686
<i>Hey, let's all get some rest.</i>

994
01:07:13,687 --> 01:07:15,891
<i>We're going to get some rest
in the warm, cozy room.</i>

995
01:07:15,892 --> 01:07:17,651
<i>Wow, that was an impressive race.</i>

996
01:07:17,652 --> 01:07:20,804
[Team RM won the right to rest
with all their hard work.]

997
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:23,995
I told you that
you don't have to do that, Ji Hyo.

998
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:27,137
[This is what heaven must feel like.]

999
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:36,773
[Everyone's passed out.]

1000
01:07:42,649 --> 01:07:46,561
[He and the wood pieces are now as one.]

1001
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:49,297
This could help release your stress.

1002
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:51,553
And it helps keep people warm too.
It's a great thing to do.

1003
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,498
It's a great thing to do all around.

1004
01:07:56,993 --> 01:08:01,284
[Kkuk's wood chopping show is
mesmerizing for his team members.]

1005
01:08:03,864 --> 01:08:05,124
You can do it with one blow, In Guk.

1006
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,230
[In Guk's almost got the full hang of it!]

1007
01:08:11,231 --> 01:08:12,722
Look at that.

1008
01:08:12,723 --> 01:08:14,154
Master!

1009
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,564
- Doesn't it feel good?
- Master!

1010
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,750
You can't be afraid of it.

1011
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:21,707
- The ax and I are as one.
- Just slam it down.

1012
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:25,702
All you're doing is helping the ax
go where it wants to go.

1013
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:27,336
There you go!

1014
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:30,197
- Next.
- My turn.

1015
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:32,550
[It's a battle of the pride
in front of the wood chopping block.]

1016
01:08:32,551 --> 01:08:34,467
Other people are waiting for their turn!
Move!

1017
01:08:34,468 --> 01:08:36,806
You need to train some more.

1018
01:08:38,444 --> 01:08:40,814
[You need more training!
Says the ever so wise Coach Kkuk.]

1019
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:45,085
[Oh... even Ye Won gets it on
her first try.]

1020
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:46,548
You're even better than Ho Jun.

1021
01:08:48,652 --> 01:08:49,950
Okay, Ho Jun.

1022
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:52,154
Believe that you can do it.
There you go!

1023
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,096
- I think I've found my new vocation.
- Right?

1024
01:08:58,097 --> 01:09:00,258
[Now even Seo Joon is in love
with the wood chopping task.]

1025
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:05,720
It's really discouraging for you, isn't it?

1026
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,501
This is what life is like.

1027
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:11,157
Things are not as easy as they look.
That's what real life is like.

1028
01:09:11,158 --> 01:09:13,159
[People do say that
life isn't as easy as it looks...]

1029
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,039
Think of the wood as
a hurdle in your own life.

1030
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,801
['Wood is like the hurdles in your own life.'
- Coach Kkuk.]

1031
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:22,100
With conviction.
There you go!

1032
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:23,999
- That's good.
- It's stuck.

1033
01:09:27,486 --> 01:09:29,731
I think you can just split
the rest with your hands.

1034
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,323
Just rip it apart with your hands.

1035
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,729
Earlier when I...

1036
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:44,313
[This is the power of the woodcutter.]

1037
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,477
- What was that?
- Come on, Ho Jun.

1038
01:09:47,478 --> 01:09:49,228
You can go again, Ho Jun.

1039
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:51,653
['These wood pieces are representation
of your own life.' - Woodcutter Kkuk.]

1040
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,591
<i>[5- Icy Field Name Tag Elimination.]</i>

1041
01:09:57,559 --> 01:10:01,153
[Final battle ground of
2014 Running Winter Olympics.]

1042
01:10:03,857 --> 01:10:05,835
What... what is all this?

1043
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:10,161
[Numbered tags...
and ice hockey equipment?]

1044
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,423
What is this?

1045
01:10:15,815 --> 01:10:17,617
Look at him smiling.
Look at him smiling from seeing all this.

1046
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:20,647
[This seems right up my alley.]

1047
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:28,869
[Time to determine the ultimate winners-
Icy Field Name Tag Elimination.]

1048
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:31,211
Each team will assign a number
to each of their own members.

1049
01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:36,848
[Each members to be assigned
numbers from one through six.]

1050
01:10:36,849 --> 01:10:38,670
- I think I should be number four.
- I'll be number three.

1051
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,013
Okay, you be number three.

1052
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:44,912
Players one through four will enter
the arena together.

1053
01:10:44,913 --> 01:10:47,275
Players five and six can
rest along the sideline.

1054
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:50,288
Each period will last five minutes.

1055
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:53,563
You need to eliminate the numbered tags from
your opposing team during those five minutes.

1056
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:57,445
But you have to make sure to eliminate
the tags in the numerical order.

1057
01:10:58,052 --> 01:11:00,961
If for example, Ji Suk Jin,
being numbered one is eliminated

1058
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:03,178
then Gary, being number five
will come in to replace Suk Jin immediately.

1059
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:06,058
That's how this whole game will play out.

1060
01:11:06,059 --> 01:11:08,578
So the first target is going to be number one.

1061
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:10,186
[Number one must be eliminated first
before number two can be targeted.]

1062
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,172
We have to eliminate their number one
while protecting our own number one.

1063
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:16,093
Every time a player is eliminated...
the opposing team scores a point.

1064
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:20,530
The team that eliminates the most number of
opposing players ultimately wins in the end.

1065
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:21,733
[Team that eliminates the most number of
their opponent wins the game!]

1066
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:24,537
Jong Kook... am I number six
because I'm the star of this team?

1067
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,225
- No, that's not it.
- You guys didn't include me in your decision.

1068
01:11:28,226 --> 01:11:32,121
Don't think like that, Ho Jun.
You're our ace up our sleeve.

1069
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:34,373
What are you talking about?
You know how valuable you are.

1070
01:11:40,043 --> 01:11:44,149
[But Ho Jun lost his star position,
and got bumped up to the fifth position.]

1071
01:11:44,818 --> 01:11:49,074
[Only players one through four
are taking the ice at the moment.]

1072
01:11:51,365 --> 01:11:55,250
[Icy Field Name Tag Elimination-
The final battle to determine the victors.]

1073
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,244
<i>[1. Jae Suk, Ye Won. 2. Kwang Soo, In Guk.
3. Gary, Baro. 4. Ha Ha, Jong Kook.]</i>

1074
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:08,386
 We need to eliminate as many of them as
possible instead of worrying about ourselves.

1075
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:15,446
[Team RM's plan- Kwang Soo with his long
arms to be on the offense.]

1076
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:20,005
And keep your eye out for Kwang Soo.
He attacks from up high because he's so tall.

1077
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:22,677
So if you feel that you're in danger,
then just lay down flat on the ground.

1078
01:12:23,492 --> 01:12:27,529
[Icy Field Name Tag Elimination- First half.
Starts now!]

1079
01:12:30,962 --> 01:12:32,642
I don't know what they're planning,
but I don't like it.

1080
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:40,698
[Closing in on Ye Won as their target.]

1081
01:12:44,456 --> 01:12:47,666
[Lies down flat on the ground as
instructed by Coach Kkuk.]

1082
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:52,140
[On the other hand,
Jae Suk is the target of the other team.]

1083
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,972
[Mr. Capable makes his move!]

1084
01:12:57,488 --> 01:13:00,560
[Guard Gary stands as his bodyguard.]

1085
01:13:01,874 --> 01:13:04,660
[Offense and defense... it's two on two!]

1086
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:10,592
Number one!
I got number one!

1087
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:13,888
Number one!
I got number one!

1088
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,087
[1. Ye Won- Out!]

1089
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:17,336
<i>[2. In Guk.]</i>

1090
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:21,932
[Must touch off with the next player on the
sideline before a player can be swapped out.]

1091
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:26,795
[Second target, In Guk,
quickly escapes being attacked.]

1092
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:28,788
Where's In Guk?

1093
01:13:34,037 --> 01:13:38,032
[Ho Jun (5) rushes in to protect In Guk.]

1094
01:13:41,926 --> 01:13:45,268
[Mr. Capable (4) has Jae Suk (1) and
Gary (3) locked in his vise grip.]

1095
01:13:45,269 --> 01:13:47,955
[Someone just needs to come in
and eliminate Jae Suk's (1) tag.]

1096
01:13:56,935 --> 01:14:00,427
[Oh? In Guk eliminates Jae Suk's tag?]

1097
01:14:01,947 --> 01:14:05,375
[And Ha Ha immediately follows
and eliminates In Guk's tag!]

1098
01:14:07,331 --> 01:14:10,185
[Ousted players must hurry
and swap in the next players.]

1099
01:14:11,587 --> 01:14:14,287
[Third target for All Star Team is, Baro.]

1100
01:14:18,414 --> 01:14:22,256
[Swapping out the players.]

1101
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:30,879
[Kwang Soo is the second target
from Team RM.]

1102
01:14:33,683 --> 01:14:35,346
It's total chaos, isn't it?

1103
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:38,527
Someone needs to come and
rip off his tag!

1104
01:14:49,433 --> 01:14:51,868
[Wow... Black hole Ho Jun ousts Kwang Soo!]

1105
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,455
- Is Kwang Soo ousted?
- Yeah.

1106
01:14:56,456 --> 01:14:58,016
- Kwang Soo's ousted?
- Yeah, he's ousted.

1107
01:14:58,017 --> 01:15:02,019
[Current target for both teams-
Number three, Baro and Gary.]

1108
01:15:07,575 --> 01:15:12,051
[Quick footed Baro...
and guard extraordinaire, Gary.]

1109
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:14,823
[Who will be ousted first?]

1110
01:15:14,824 --> 01:15:18,029
This is no joke.
They're brutal out there!

1111
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,105
[Just then, Black hole Ho Jun swoops in
again and eliminates Gary's tag!]

1112
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,088
[Look at this!
It's next target, Ha Ha!]

1113
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:30,681
[What stroke of luck is this?]

1114
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:35,415
[Eliminates number three,
and number four as the cherry on top.]

1115
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,591
[5- Ji Suk Jin.]

1116

[Big-nose is easily taken care of
by Mr. Capable.]

isn't even budging.]

1134

[Finally gets their chance!]

1135
01:17:04,764 --> 01:17:07,794
[Team RM's Jae Suk gets ousted too!]

[The ever busy Eliminator Ho Jun...]

1137
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:14,894
[Is ousted by Ha Ha's ambush attack!]

1138
01:17:14,895 --> 01:17:16,376
[If Ho Jun's ousted...]

1139
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:22,496

How are we supposed to get them
when they're lying down on the ground?

1152
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,609
Here, let me show you.
Lie down on the ground.

1153

[Time for another Coach Kkuk's lesson.]

1154
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:15,993

your knee into their side.

- There's no plan of action out there.
- It's total chaos.

1158
01:18:32,517 --> 01:18:33,622
[This team's plan is to attack
however they can.]

1159
01:18:37,266 --> 01:18:38,620

1166
01:19:14,002 --> 01:19:16,398
[Suk Jin abandons Kwang Soo as soon
as Mr. Capable closes in on them?]

1167

Someone needs to come help me!

1168
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:23,042

[Baro lies down on the ground
with Mr. Capable as his shield?]

1172
01:19:38,402 --> 01:19:40,390
[Utter chaos.]

1173
01:19:42,595 --> 01:19:44,972
This really is no joke out there.

1174
01:19:44,973 --> 01:19:47,801

rip off each other's name tags.

1175
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:53,528
[Quick footed Baro shoots up
to escape their attacks.]

1176
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,384
[With Kwang Soo getting ousted,
new target for Team RM is Gary.]

1177
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:07,864
[Huh?]

1178
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:13,112
[Baro is captured from foolishly
trying out his martial arts moves.]

1179
01:20:13,113 --> 01:20:15,188
I'm so sorry!
I won't do that ever again!

1180
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:16,667
Just lay down!

1181
01:20:21,777 --> 01:20:24,211
[But Ace won't let this chance escape her.]

1182
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,724
- Jong Kook! He's next!
- Who's number four?

1183
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:32,927

[Mr. Capable pulls the boulder move again.]

1185

[It's a fierce and bloody one on one battle.]

1193
01:21:05,572 --> 01:21:07,849
[Is that how you want to play?]

1194
01:21:08,409 --> 01:21:10,284
[A moment later.]

1195
01:21:12,919 --> 01:21:15,019
[That's why you never should've
provoked me!]

1196
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:18,892
What is this mess!

1197
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:23,479
[Every player on Team RM is
focused on ousting Mr. Capable.]

1198
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,148

Then I'm the next target...]

1205
01:21:56,738 --> 01:21:59,955
[Sticky wad of gum bodyguard?
Seo Joon lays his body over Ho Jun's.]

1206
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:05,099
[Hm...]

1207
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:10,471
[Target Big-nose is left all alone.]

1208
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:15,525
[No one is paying him any attention
even though he's the target.]

1209
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:20,441
- Number five is out.
- Five is ousted!

1210
01:22:21,084 --> 01:22:23,167

[Everyone goes in after
All Star Team's next target, Ye Won.]

1214

- Why isn't anyone trying to oust me?
- Who's the next target?

1215
01:22:44,488 --> 01:22:46,405
Who's the next target?

1216
01:22:48,275 --> 01:22:51,221
[Team All Star can't even remember
who their current target is.]

1217
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,837
[It's me.]

1218

01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,297
[Ye Won swoops in on
the current target, Jae Suk!]

1235
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:21,041
[Only ten seconds left!]

1236
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,765
[The countdown is on!]

1237

new comrades.
