[Taking place in the largest set in history.]

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,003
[In a battle where no mercy exists.]

6
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:17,071
[A battle that requires the best
Team Work, Intelligence, and Stamina.]

A park in the city of Seoul.]

00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:40,242
[An enormous setup in the park.]

12
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:48,023
[Team Running Man makes their entrance.]

13
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:50,688
What is this hand thing we're doing?

14
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,598
- I've never done this before.
- Why are we doing all this?

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,354
- We are... Running Man!
- We've never done this before.

16
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:01,603
[Team Running Man]

17
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,674
[They seemed to be confused as they
come down from the lift platform.]

18
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:09,296
I had no idea that you guys would be so
happy by something so simple as a lift.

19
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:12,526
You should've done this for us sooner.
We loved doing that.

20
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,752
This is the first time you've ever done
something like that for us.

21
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:17,003
That was the first time I've ever done
something like that in half a century.

22
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:23,522
As you can see behind you,
the sign says, 'Team Running Man'.

23
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,178
Then are we all on the same team?

24
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,992
I know that you guys all worked very hard
during our recent trip to Australia

25
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:33,694
and it seems as though you've only been
working separately lately.

26
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:38,569
So as you can see, you all will be
teamed up together on the same team.

27
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:43,417
- Then I bet we'll have seven guests today.
- Are we going to battle another team?

28
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:46,926
- Is it going to be a younger team?
- Not many people can beat us as a team.

29
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,416
Yeah, there aren't many teams out there
who can beat us together as a team.

30
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,030
Let's see who our opponents are.
Please come on out!

31
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,457
[Who will their opponents be?]

32
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,589
- If it's seven people...
- That's so cool!

33
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,380
[Could they be Idols?]

34
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:14,507
- Grey hair? Is it a movie director?
- They're not idols.

35
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,285
[We will take on
the Running Man Team today.]

36
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:33,983
[Team Angel Eyes.]

37
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,563
[Full of friendly faces.]

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,360
I saw Seung Ri earlier this morning.

39
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,575
We live in the same apartment building,
but we both ignored each other.

40
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:47,002
I wondered if he was going to be on today,
so I purposely ignored him when I saw him.

41
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:50,239
[Welcome to Running Man.]

42
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:56,120
[Everyone seems to be
very glad to see each other.]

43
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:04,149
[A fiery competitive atmosphere
right off the bat.]

44
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:08,230
- We can take them on!
- We can totally take them on!

45
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,120
[Extremely confident Team Running Man.]

46
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,850
I'll take charge of Kwon Hae Hyo.

47
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:15,492
When I saw Hae Hyo from the back...

48
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:21,519
You know how when you watch the news,
you sometimes see a team of scientists?

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,644
I thought that it was a group of
scientists who came to visit us.

50
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,621
[A team of scientists who are here
to help save the earth?]

51
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:30,208
[Please save our planet...]

52
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,716
So are these the seven guests whom
we'll be competing against today?

53
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,739
- Yes.
- We really can do this.

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,014
Sang Yoon and I played brothers
in the recent drama we were in together.

55
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:43,014
[Sang Yoon and Kwang Soo played brothers
in a recent drama that they were in together.]

56
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,460
[Ah... that idiotic prince?]

57
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,598
We all know you played the idiot prince.

58
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,230
I told you time and time again,
Mang Goo, Young Goo and Kwang Soo.

59
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,334
[Korea's representative idiots-
Mang Goo, Young Goo, and Kwang Soo.]

60
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,442
[Kwang Soo is one of the three
national idiot representatives.]

61
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:03,127
Can you all say a word to the viewers?
Let's start with Gu Hye Sun.

62
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:06,060
It's been so long since
I've been on a variety show.

63
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:09,150
- Wow, you really are so beautiful.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:13,909
[Gu Hye Sun-
Brighter than the spring sun.]

65
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,189
[Her skin is not just porcelain white,
it's almost transparent.]

66
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,026
Standing next to Hae Hyo is
making you look even prettier.

67
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,947
[Swaps out his place immediately.]

68
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,391
[From a research scientist
to a petty company president.]

69
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,645
- Can you say something, Sang Yoon?
- Nice to meet you, my name is Lee Sang Yoon.

70
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,730
[Lee Sang Yoon- Nation's 'Best Friend'.]

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,013
- Can you say a word, Hae Hyo?
- It's nice to be here.

72
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,585
- I think it's been about ten years now?
- Seriously?

73
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:41,358
It really has been a long time since you've
been a guest star on a variety show.

74
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,543
I've been a huge fan of yours ever since
the drama, 'Mister Q'.

75
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,543
What was the last variety show
that you guest starred on?

76
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:48,115
I don't remember.
It was sometime in the nineties.

77
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,498
[His first guest starring role on a
variety show in the 21st century!]

78
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,189
It's nice to meet you all.
My name is Kim Ji Suk.

79
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,501
[Flower boy next door actor, Kim Ji Suk.]

80
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,557
He's a total airhead.
I'm telling you that he is.

81
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:05,159
- I agree, he is an airhead.
- He used to be 'Kwang Soo' back in the day.

82
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:10,377
[Kwang Soo's formidable rival.]

83
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,987
It's been a while since Ji Suk has been
on a variety show though.

84
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:15,741
- But his image has changed a lot.
- It's changed completely.

85
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,736
But I'm sure that it'll resurface today.

86
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:22,808
[You all wait for it.
Kim Ji Suk will show his true side later on.]

87
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:23,857
Ha Neul!

88
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,916
Hello, my name is Kang Ha Neul

89
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:31,957
and I played a character named 'Lee Hyo Shin'
on the set of the recently aired drama, 'Heirs'.

90
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,507
[The rising new star, Kang Ha Neul.]

91
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,298
Hello, my name is Seung Ri of Big Bang.

92
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,719
[The cutie pie of Big Bag, Seung Ri.]

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,070
You paid a lot of attention to
your outfit today.

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,620
[His outfit looks like a magician's outfit
from some magic show in Las Vegas.]

95
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,082
It's nice to meet you all.
This is my first appearance on Running Man.

96
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:57,017
[Popular actor of our time, Gong Hyung Jin.]

97
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,279
So are we going to be competing
against them?

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,237
Yes, it's variety world's Team Running Man,
and drama world's team Angel Eyes.

99
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,828
[Variety world's Team Running Man vs
Drama world's Team Angel Eyes.]

100
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,912
[7:7 Super Match!]

101
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:15,272
Gold envelopes?

102
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,309
Are they going to give us money?

103
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,942
- I think they're giving us money.
- There are two envelopes in front of you.

104
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:29,086
One envelope is from the drama department,
and the other is from the variety department.

105
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:34,420
Those two envelopes...
the winning team will take both.

106
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:37,707
[Both of the golden envelopes will be
given out to today's winning team.]

107
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,673
I have a feeling that the envelope from
the drama department will have more in it.

108
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,538
- You think so?
- They've got the bigger bucks.

109
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,193
They even send their actors on a trip when
their drama wraps up.

110
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,315
- I know.
- We just went to Australia ourselves.

111
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,205
- We went there to film an episode.
- We worked while we were there.

112
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:52,650
We can't go on any trips because
our show is constantly ongoing.

113
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:55,219
Because if we go on trips,
it means they're getting rid of our show.

114
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,845
That's why we can't go on any trips.

115
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:03,623
[To our dear viewers...
please show your love for variety shows.]

116
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,367
Sending us on a trip means
they're getting rid of our show.

117
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,032
[A sudden somber atmosphere...]

118
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,696
Today's competition will be between
Team Running Man and Team Angel Eyes.

119
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,303
Today's race is,
'Selection of the Top Rescue Team'.

120
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:17,210
[Team Running Man vs Team Angel Eyes.]

121
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,648
[Only one top rescue team.]

122
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:26,563
[Winner of each round will be given the
first choice option at the final mission.]

123
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:32,214
You must use your option wisely to
bring home the victory to you and your team.

124
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:35,407
I will now tell you your first location.

125
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:38,679
You must all go to the observatory
in Yeouido.

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,223
[Variety department vs Drama department-
Battle of the two departments' honor.]

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,843
[Team Running Man is back together again
for the first time in a long time.]

128
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:55,092
I wonder if the writers gave us an easy team
on purpose to boost up our spirits.

129
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,931
It takes more than an average team now
to beat us as a team.

130
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,521
Ji Suk is their hole.

131
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,730
[Variety world's original black hole, Ji Suk.]

132
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,369
Sang Yoon's really bad at
anything athletic too.

133
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,575
- Who?
- He's the type to drop the ball all the time.

134
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,230
We should all take charge of one person.

135
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,971
Ji Hyo can take charge of Hye Sun.

136
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:14,035
- Ji Hyo will beat Hye Sun for sure.
- And I'll take care of Hae Hyo.

137
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,408
[Big-nose to take charge of Hae Hyo.]

138
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:19,848
This means that a third of that team
is pretty much equivalent to Kwang Soo.

139
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,094
[Those are pretty good odds?]

140
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:26,640
[Team Running Man arrives first at
the location, full of confidence.]

141
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,998
Let's go in!

142
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:33,804
[What is the mission that awaits them
in that tall skyscraper?]

143
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,354
I wonder what we'll be doing here?

144
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:40,108
- I wonder if we're doing a race in here?
- I think we have a mission in here.

145
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:45,013
- Are you warming up?
- Yes, of course.

146
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,888
- Suk Jin looks confident of himself today.
- He's our 'ace' today.

147
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,671
[Big-nose seems to be
pretty sure of himself today.]

148
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:52,003
Suk Jin has his eyes on Ji Suk today.

149
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:55,937
- Ji Suk's really good.
- No, Ji Suk's not that good.

150
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,809
[You know what he's like...]

151
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:05,359
[He could be described as
last decade's 'Kwang Soo'?]

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,523
This is your first round.

153
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:11,189
[Team Running Man vs Team Angel Eyes-
First round competition.]

154
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,863
This is a 'loyalty relay race',
which will test your teamwork skills.

155
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:20,081
[Loyalty relay race?]

156
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:22,635
- I'm so scared.
- You know what this place is, right?

157
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,837
Let's not do anything that requires
climbing up flights of stairs or anything.

158
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,738
[No way... NO WAY...]

159
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,745
Why do you think we're here
at the 63 Building?

160
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:38,252
You'll need to climb the stairs from

[Stair climbing from first floor through
sixtieth in a form of relay.]

162
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:45,828
[Are you... kidding me?]

163
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,191
It's possible that you're going to send
Hae Hyo home during the first mission.

164
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:54,580
- Sixty floors?
- We'll get a good workout in, so it's nice.

165
00:09:56,316 --> 00:10:03,118
The last relay runner needs to pull their
team's colored flag located on the last floor.

166
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:09,025
And you can decide amongst yourselves how
many floors each of you will climb.

167
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,809
[Order and the number of floors
they'll climb is up to them.]

168

[63 Loyalty Relay]

169
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:17,152
[A total of 60 floors.]

170
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:20,473
[Up to them to decide how many floors
each player will be responsible for.]

171
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:24,286
[The first team to reach the top floor to
pull out the flag wins the round.]

172
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,918
Don't you think that Jong Kook should
climb up at least 20 floors?

173
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,459
- No, no.
- 20 floors, at least.

174
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,348
So how many floors is that per person?
Nine floors per person?

175
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,827
In fact, Jong Kook can take
all sixty floors on his own.

176
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,544
[60 floors...
a walk in the park for this guy.]

177
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,601
Who do you think that
I'll be able to beat from that team?

178
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,906
I think that I'd be able to be faster
than Ha Ha at least.

179
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,436
- No, Ha Ha's fast.
- He's fast?

180
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,764
No, you need to take on Suk Jin.

181
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:49,116
Did you just stay that you think
that you'd be faster than me?

182
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,460
- No, Ji Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

183
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:55,798
- Hae Hyo is totally dissing us right now.
- How many floors are you climbing up?

184
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,358
- You don't know who you're talking to.
- We have to be quick, right?

185
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:06,445
[Totally fired up!]

186
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,508
You're tying your shoelaces too tight.
You're going to cut off your circulation.

187
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:13,373
Your feet are going to turn all blue.
Are you taking off your jacket right now?

188
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,051
- I'm starting to get all sweaty.
- Seriously, Hae Hyo.

189
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:21,024
Do I need to start warming up here?

190
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,448
[This is how you warm up
in the variety world!]

191
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:37,017
[Mr. Capable is on the loose!]

192
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,467
[It's Jamsil dance king, Mr. Gary's turn!]

193
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,644
[Ouch, the ankle bone...]

194
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,102
- No, I'm okay.
- He's okay.

195
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,679
It's okay, it'll be peach season soon.
(Ankle bone in Korean=peach bone.)

196
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,720
- You stay out of this!
- Get back in line.

197
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,051
- Why? Why can't I join in?
- Just get back in line.

198
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:11,006
Everyone take place in line
in the order that you'll be going.

199
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,320
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

200
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:16,713
[A teamwork mission-
The 63 Loyalty Relay.]

201
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:26,603
[Climbing up 60 flights of stairs.
Mission impossible starts now!]

202
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,134
- Is Jong Kook the last player?
- Of course he is.

203
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,134
That's what always seems to happen.

204
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,530
Have you ever seen a bus
change its route?

205
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,787

[Hae Hyo vs Ha Ha]

208
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,976
So you're the third runner?
I thought it might've been Hye Sun.

209
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,313
We're starting out with our weakest players,
but you guys seem to be the opposite.

210
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,295
Who are you calling weak?

211
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:07,465
This race is no laughing matter.
It's like a race of death.

212
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,843
['Kwang Soo' of ten years ago...
erase the old Ji Suk out of your memory?]

00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,663
Hurry, Sang Yoon!

327
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,242
I have to do this for Hye Sun!
I need to hurry for Hye Sun!

328
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:40,182
[Arriving on the 46th floor!
Players of both teams give it their all!]

329
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:53,754
[Hye Sun is the last runner for Team Angel.
Sang Yoon needs to buy her some lead!]

330
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,455
[Team Running Man's last runner, Kkuk,
gets on his way!]

331
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,924
[Quite a huge gap between the two teams.]

332
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,828
[However...]

333
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:18,934
[The beast makes his entrance!]

334
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:25,395
[Runs up the two flights of stairs
in the blink of an eye!]

335
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,515
[He takes over the lead!]

336
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:36,167
[There's no end
to the strength of his muscles...]

337
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:51,233
[But he gets held up by Hye Sun
on the 55th floor.]

338
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,280
Please don't go.

339
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,929
- Is this it? Is this the 60th floor?
- What?

340
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:09,593
[But there's something that even
the Muscle Boy can't win against...]

341
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:14,407
[The power of a pretty girl.]

342
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:19,338
- How many flights of stairs have you climbed?
- What?

343
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,205
[Continuing to engage him in conversation and
blocking him from taking the lead.]

344
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,163
Hye Sun.

345
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:39,133
[You two look like you're here on a date.]

346
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:41,799
[Arrives at the art gallery on
the 60th floor together.]

347
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:46,330
- Where do we have to go?
- Where do we go?

348
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:49,275
[Where you need to go is...]

349
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:55,945
[To the observatory on the 60th floor where
the whole city skyline can be seen.]

350
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,569
[Must we really pull the flag
and end this round?]

351
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,089
[Jong Kook, what are you doing
up there?]

352
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,808
I'm sorry, Hye Sun!

353
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,156
[Victory is victory!
Must get to his flag first!]

354
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,743
Congratulations,
you pulled out your flag first.

355
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,766
You will now start your real mission.

356
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:26,850
[What do you mean, 'real mission'?]

357
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,234
What happened?

358
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,562
Here's a walkie-talkie.

359
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:36,008
[Each member in the stairwell receives
a radio transmitter.]

360
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,132
[A radio transmitter?
What do you want us to do with these?]

361
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,313
[Radio transmitters are passed out
to all the team members.]

362
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,413
You will now start your real mission.

363
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,089
Blue Team, you pulled your flag out first.

364
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,516
Of the 60 flights of stairs which
your team just climbed up

365
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:57,069
what's the writing that was written
underneath the tiger?

366
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:59,813
[Say what?]

367
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:03,841
[Say what about the tiger?]

368
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:07,425
[In truth, having to climb up 60 flights
of stairs was a fake mission.]

369
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:14,946
[There's a painting hanging on the wall
in the stairwell of each floor.]

370
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,066
There were a lot of paintings there,
weren't there?

371
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:24,095
Okay, here's a question for Gu Hye Sun
for coming in at second place.

372
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:28,595
What is the picture that was drawn above
the writing, 'Rock and Roll'?

373
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,560
- What did you say?
- That's your question.

374
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:34,228
If you know the answer, then tell me now,
or if not, then you get a radio transmitter.

375
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,950
- A radio transmitter?
- Here.

376
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:39,700
[They are each given their own transmitter
to allow them to communicate with other.]

377
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:43,538
The tiger painting...
what's the writing written under the tiger?

378
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:49,666
<i>Ji Hyo, did you win or lose?</i>

379
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,266
Ji Hyo, did you win or lose?

380
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,467
What happened, Jong Kook?

381
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,969
[No one's even listening because
they're all too busy talking themselves.]

382
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,782
I need a bottle of water and a snack.

383
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:06,460
Who's this?

384
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,600
You need to find the tiger painting.
Hurry and look on the floor you're on.

385
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,831
Did you win or lose?
Just tell me that.

386
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,937
And an ice cold Americano.

387
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,804
[A total chaotic mess-
Team Running Man isn't communicating well.]

388
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,966
[On the other hand...]

389
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,878
A painting with the writing, 'Rock and Roll'
written on it somewhere?

390
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,797
Where's the painting that
she's talking about?

391
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:33,461
The writing, 'Rock and Roll'.
And the drawing that's drawn above it.

392
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,494
<i>The writing, 'Rock and Roll'.
And the drawing that's drawn above it.</i>

393
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,535
Is she saying that there's
something there?

394
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:53,764
[Team Angel starts to investigate
all the pictures and paintings.]

395
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,606
[Not even any static on the transmitter.
Everyone listens closely to do their share.]

396
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:01,282
What's going on here?

397
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,345
What is this?
What's going on?

398
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:05,208
What is it?

399
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,895
Do you not know which floor it's on?

400
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:12,310
[Of all these numerous paintings,
there is only one painting of a tiger.]

401
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,158
[It's on the 14th floor that
Ha Ha and Seung Ri ran by.]

402
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,586
<i>What is the writing that's written
underneath the tiger?</i>

403
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:23,823
[The writing underneath the tiger?]

404
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:28,032
<i>What's the picture that's painted above
the writing, 'Rock and Roll'?</i>

405
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,708
[The picture that's painted above
the writing, 'Rock and Roll'?]

406
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:34,432
Look through all the paintings and see if
you can find the writing, 'Rock and Roll'.

407
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:37,657
Somewhere amongst these stairwells
are some written words.

408
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,648
<i>It's the writing, 'Rock and Roll',
and the picture painted above the writing.</i>

409
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:45,704
Under the tiger picture.
Are you guys all listening to me?

410
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:49,748
Find out what's written under that picture,
and tell me what it says.

411
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:55,225
[None of these seven members are listening
for they're all too busy talking themselves.]

412
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:57,815
Is there a mission?

413
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,222
There's something written under
the picture of a tiger!

414
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:05,473
<i>Underneath the tiger picture!</i>

415
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:08,833
[They're finally starting to pay attention
after hearing the anger in Kkuk's voice.]

416
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,994
Picture of a tiger?

417
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,808
Tiger isn't the problem right now.
I can't even walk at the moment.

418
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:21,240
[Only Ace Blank Ji starts to catch on,
and begins searching through the paintings.]

419
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:26,484
[Team Angel on the other hand,
are all searching for 'Rock and Roll'.]

420
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,763
What are you doing?
What is it?

421
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:32,888
- You don't need to know.
- Where are all my team members?

422
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:36,764
[Stops using the transmitter
to shout down the stairwell himself.]

423
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,402
Picture of a tiger!

424
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:46,680
[Not a very clear message-
Only knows to look for the tiger.]

425
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,113
[Did he really say the picture of a tiger?]

426
00:29:56,974 --> 00:30:02,171
[Blank Ji discovers the picture of
a tiger on the 14th floor!]

427
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,157
[The correct answer
is right in front of her eyes!]

428
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:09,239
[So what about the picture of the tiger?]

429
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:14,116
[Just then,
Ha Neul also discovers the painting.]

430
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:15,427
[And Seung Ri also comes down
to join them by the painting.]

431
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:16,967
Bogoship!

432
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:20,107
<i>- Bogoship?
- You want me to go somewhere?</i>

433
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,298
No, this isn't 'Rock and Roll'.

434
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:33,247
Eagle!
Jong Kook, it's a white headed eagle!

435
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,589
[Huh?]

436
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,383
[Since she's unclear about her mission,
she does the opponent's mission instead.]

437
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:44,271
[Immediately punishes anyone
who tries to get in her way.]

438
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,052
[I'm Song Ji Hyo!]

439
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:51,139
It's the white headed eagle,
and the tiger is, 'Bogoship'!

440
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,359
- Hurry up and climb up the stairs!
- Where's the picture of the tiger?

441
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:57,805
Bogoship!
What about the tiger?

442
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:04,395
- What did you say?
- White headed eagle!

443
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,105
What did you say?

444
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:15,137
[Seung Ri is relentless in his attempt
to get in Blank Ji's way.]

445
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:22,129
[Delinquent Blank Ji explodes from within.]

446
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,329
Rock and Roll is, white headed eagle!

447
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,995
- Bogoship.
- What's going on here?

448
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:30,189
Take her radio transmitter away from her.

449
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,594
Hey, get away from me!

450
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:34,751
[What did I tell you?
I'm Song Ji Hyo!]

451
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:49,531
[Frustrated Kkuk had gone down
ten flights of stairs.]

452
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:53,787
What did you say?

453
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,211
[Jong Kook, please...]

454
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:57,919
What did you say?

455
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:01,492
What are they saying?
I can't hear anything.

456
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,813
[Chatty Running Man members.
They're all still talking amongst themselves.]

457
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,812
Kim Jong Kook, what is your answer?

458
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:14,457
[What is the word that is written underneath
the picture of the tiger?]

459
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,368
Tiger and the eagle?

460
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,615
What did you say?

461
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:23,256
- What did you say?
- Bogoship!

462
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:25,121
What about 'Bogoship'?

463
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,047
- Under the tiger is, 'Bogoship'.
- She said, under the tiger is, 'Bogoship'.

464
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,675
Bo-go-ship.

465
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:33,459
<i>Bo-go-ship.</i>

466
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,281
Bogoshipda!
(I miss you)

467
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:42,377
- Take the 'da' off in the end.
- Take the 'da' off. Just 'Bogoship'.

468
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,553
Correct answer is, 'bogoship'.

469
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:45,939
[The three letter word under
the picture is?]

470
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:55,535
[Hye Sun, who's been sitting in the corner
waiting for the answer from her teammates.]

471
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,555
[What is the meaning of that smile?]

472
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,414
- Did we win?
- I don't know.

473
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,030
She hit my head so many times that
I can't even seem to think straight.

474
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:06,934
Why did she hit you when the
game is over?

475
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:11,268
- Is the game over?
- I don't know. Did we win?

476
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:18,074
[They find a lifeless zombie in
the elevator.]

477
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:23,847
- Are you alright?
- Did we win?

478
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:26,664
- No one knows.
- The reason why I'm sure of our win...

479
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:29,908
- Listen to me for a minute.
- But Ji Suk, why are you with Kwang Soo?

480
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,322
Didn't we just win the game?

481
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:35,539
- When did they take over the lead?
- Who, me?

482
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,221
[No one seems to know
what they're talking about.]

483
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,807
[Guys, I'm right here...]

484
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:42,596
[He's right here waiting for you guys.]

485
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,668
[Someone save me...]

486
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:49,248
Why isn't it stopping?

487
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:55,094
[Even the elevators are ignoring them.]

488
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:58,917
- What were you guys doing?
- I couldn't understand what you said.

489
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,007
[Everyone comes to gather on
the 60th floor.]

490
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,600
- I couldn't understand what he said.
- I couldn't understand either.

491
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,116
The tiger!

492
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,417
['Tiger' that no one seems to
have heard.]

493
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,510
Tiger!
And it was, 'Bogoship'!

494
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,014
[No one is able to understand each other.]

495
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,660
- I'm sorry!
- What were you thinking?

496
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:18,040
[Airhead, Ji Suk.
Proves himself to be their black hole.]

497
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:21,391
- We told you that he's not very good.
- He's not good at all.

498
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,629
He got carried up the stairs by Kwang Soo.

499
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:26,823
[Leopards really don't
change their spots, do they?]

500
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:29,271
Anyways, the winning team is,
Team Angel Eyes.

501
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:32,082
[Winning team is, Team Angel Eyes?]

502
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:37,291
[Huh?]

503
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,125
What are you talking about?
We won this game.

504
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:45,467
[Ten minutes ago...
when Kkuk was starting to get angry.]

505
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:49,803
[Hye Sun sat calmly on the bench listening
to her teammates on the transmitter.]

506
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,973
What's the picture above the words,
'Rock and Roll'?

507
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:56,173
Everyone go back to your starting point,
and look through all the paintings.

508
00:34:56,702 --> 00:35:02,085
[Team Angel moved according to their
calmly thought out plan.]

509
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:08,385
[Great teamwork... working in perfect sync.]

510
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:15,111
[While Seung Ri tried to thwart Blank Ji off
after having discovered the answer...]

511
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:20,853
[Ha Neul calmly relayed the answer to
his teammates one level at a time.]

512
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,679
<i>It's an eagle!</i>

513
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:27,652
Do I have to pull this out?
It's an eagle!

514
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:33,247
[Team Angel wins the Teamwork Game.]

515
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:37,156
[And while she quietly sits in the corner
to catch her breath...]

516
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:41,497
[Kkuk returns with his answer.]

517
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:51,869
[Team Running Man were so confident of
themselves before the game began.]

518
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,264
[Totally humiliated and befuddled.]

519
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,924
I think it's a hint.

520
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:58,703
[What special advantage did
the winning team earn themselves?]

521
00:35:58,704 --> 00:36:01,344
[First option]

522
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:05,034
The more you earn those option tickets,
the better off you'll be at the end.

523
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:07,344
[Collecting as many of those tickets as they
can will give them an upper hand in the end!]

524
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,119
[Team Running Man vs Team Angel-
Off to their next location.]

525
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:14,696
[Conversing about Seung Ri's tactic.]

526
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,936
[Complimenting Hye Sun's clear instructions.]

527
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:24,136
I didn't want the background noise to
interfere with what I was telling you.

528
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,650
So that's why I went off to a quiet place
to talk into the transmitter to everyone.

529
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,989
Who lost the lead to the other team?
It was you, Kwang Soo, wasn't it?

530
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,457
- Let's be honest here.
- I gave us a lead.

531
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,236
[Everyone blaming one another.]

532
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,080
[Team Running Man's chaotic,
and unclear transmitter message.]

533
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:45,833
[This is the team where every single one
of their members had something to say.]

534
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,196
[Second mission location-
Seoul Civil Administration Office.]

535
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,604
- We need to show them this time.
- It would be humiliating to lose again.

536
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:04,632
This is nice. Doesn't it feel like we're
building teamwork before we start our drama?

537
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,329
Yeah, this is really nice.

538
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,610
[Their friendships are getting built deeper
as they climb up and down these steps.]

539
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:15,279
It's a quiz!
Isn't that a quiz setting?

540
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:18,575
[Bingo!
It is a quiz!]

541
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,207
- We're confident in this game!
- I'll take the entertainment category!

542
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,515
There's a Seoul University graduate
on that team.

543
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,653
- Yeah, you're right.
- I forgot Sang Yoon went to Seoul University.

544
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:31,694
[They remember that Sang Yoon is
a graduate of Seoul University.]

545
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:35,105
- Sang Yoon is a Seoul University alumni.
- I recently graduated.

546
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:39,847
- Must be nice.
- It's okay, because we have Jae Suk.

547
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:44,950
This round will be a quiz contest to
test the two teams.

548
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:48,461
[Round two- Quiz Battle.]

549
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,074
It'll be done in an 'All-Kill' method.

550
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,237
[Team Angel is full of intellectuals.]

551
00:37:57,238 --> 00:38:00,983
As you probably all know, the mics in front
of you will blow puffs of air.

552
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:05,921
If you give the wrong answer, then a puff
of air will be blown in your face.

553
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:08,130
We'll make sure to get hit in the face
with the air if we're wrong.

554
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:11,646
[That's what you call 'variety humor'.]

555
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,858
You have to get hit in the mouth.
That looks the funniest.

556
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,042
[Variety veteran, Big-nose, gives them
a quick lesson on how to be funny.]

557
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:20,529
Since we have the members of
Team Angel here as our guests today...

558
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,998
we have chosen different professions that you
often see in dramas to suit our guests.

559
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:27,991
[A quiz based on different professions
that you often see in dramas.]

560
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:34,275
Now you may determine amongst yourselves
who will start off the quiz battle.

561
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:38,148
- Why don't we start with Hae Hyo?
- We should start with someone smart.

562
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,477
- Like we did the last time?
- How about we start off with Gary?

563
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:44,946
[First player from Team Running Man- Gary.]

564
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:49,003
[Gut feelings over brains-
Random Mr. Capable, Gary.]

565
00:38:49,004 --> 00:38:52,049
Gary is good at things like this.

566
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:55,532
- I'm not good at things like this.
- Rock, paper, scissors?

567
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,461
- Why don't you go out there?
- Should I get a feel for their skills?

568
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,820
Hae Hyo!

569
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:03,923
[Team Angel's first player- Hae Hyo.]

570
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,907
We love you!

571
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,466
We love you! Good luck!
(Word play with Hae Hyo's name.)

572
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:12,985
We have to determine the category

573
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:16,579
and we'll determine it by playing
rock, paper, scissors.

574
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,497
- Okay, I understand.
- Take them all down, Gary!

575
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:21,384
- Make it easy on everyone.
- Should I just take them all down?

576
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:27,614
[Gary wins the right to choose first.]

577
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,628
- Go with something you know.
- Singer!

578
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,158
- Singer.
- I'll go with, 'singer'.

579
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,469
[15 years since he made his debut-
Gary chooses the category, 'singer'.]

580
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,085
Singer Gae, fighting!

581
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:39,630
- It's a singer related music question.
- It's a music question?

582
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,198
- I don't know many singers.
- I just go with my gut feeling.

583
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:46,534
But if it's an old song,
it could give Hae Hyo the advantage.

584
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:48,248
[Old pop song could give
Hae Hyo the advantage.]

585
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:50,473
- Please listen carefully.
- Okay.

586
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:54,410
- In pansori... (traditional singing)
- Pan?

587
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:02,085
- Usage of a drum in pansori...
- Answer.

588
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:08,590
[The question isn't even done
being asked?]

589
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:12,028
- Usage of a drum in pansori...
- Answer. Go-Soo.

590
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,391
Go-Soo?
I haven't finished asking the question.

591
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,069
- But that's your answer?
- Go-Soo.

592
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,810
No way.

593
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:22,650
[Team Angel members are preparing themselves
to get shot in the face with the puff of air.]

594
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:24,681
I know what a 'Go-Soo' is too.

595
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:26,622
Isn't that the person who gives the beat?

596
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:28,774
- Is it wrong?
- The correct answer is...

597
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:31,766
[Correct answer]

598
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,041
[A refreshing puff of air.]

599
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,910
[Hae Hyo starts off with a bang!]

600
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:49,165
- What was that?
- That was unbelievable.

601
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,426
[Newly formed Kwon Hae Hyo's fan club.]

602
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,816
You have to cut them off
right now, Jae Suk.

603
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:01,312
- Okay.
- That was unbelievable.

604
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,825
[The ace up their sleeve.
King of Common Sense, Jae Suk on the prowl.]

605
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,574
If I don't cut you off right now,
then it's all over for my team.

606
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,418
- Go with 'Announcer'.
- Yeah, go with that one.

607
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:17,719
Announcer!

608
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:22,625
[Jae Suk chooses the 'Announcer' category.]

609
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:26,186
It could be a Hangeul related question.

610
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,951
Hangeul?
That's hard.

611
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,508
- I know.
- Pronunciation, and such?

612
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:35,213
- Actors are better with things like that.
- Then I chose wrong.

613
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:38,275
- You can change the category.
- Then I want to go with 'Athletes'.

614
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:39,919
- Athletes?
- Athletes.

615
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,833
- We have to cut him off right now.
- Will you be okay with that category?

616
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,170
- Will you be okay with that category?
- Yes, I really love sports.

617
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,869
[King of Common Sense is known
for his love of sports.]

618
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,607
- Here's your question.
- Okay.

619
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,346
The topic is, soccer.

620
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:54,732
[Topic- Soccer]

621
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:57,771
- This should be my category.
- He's the one who knows everything about it.

622
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:02,547
The country where
the 2014 World Cup will be taking place is...

623
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:03,691
That would be Brazil.

624
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:09,445
[The question hasn't even been asked.]

625
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,905
[In an extreme state of nervousness with
the King of Common Sense sitting next to him.]

626
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,777
I'll ask the question again.

627
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:19,296
Yes, Brazil is where the 2014 World Cup
will be taking place.

628
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,821
Where will it take place in 2018?

629
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,282
[Immediate response]

630
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:26,493
The country where it'll take place in 2018?

631
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,819
Wait a minute, where is it going to be?

632
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,616
[Which country will the 2018 World Cup
be taking place in?]

633
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:39,573
- Please!
- Three, two, one.

634
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:44,666
- Wait a minute, 2018?
- Just answer the question.

635
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,322
- Wrong.
- 2018?

636
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:49,091
- The time's up.
- Is that how you buy more time?

637
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:53,182
You really are a pro at this.
It's been at least 20 minutes!

638
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:55,627
[Time over]

639
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,777
United Arab Emirates.
That's not the country?

640
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,913
Team Running!
England!

641
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:20,480
Wait, where is it being held in 2018?

642
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,173
The location for 2018 games
have already been chosen?

643
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:26,950
- I know where it is!
- Team Running!

644
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,066
I think... Qatar!

645
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,817
- It's not Qatar?
- No, it's not.

646
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:36,034
Qatar is in 2022.

647
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:38,784
- Ah, is that it?
- Qatar is in 2022?

648
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,919
So that's not it either.

649
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,536
- Is it somewhere in Europe?
- They've already chosen for 2022?

650
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:48,706
- Why are they in such a hurry to decide?
- Just say whatever. Don't worry about us.

651
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:50,576
We're all ready to get blown
in the face.

652
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:52,640
Belgium.

653
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,715
Stop saying whatever comes
to your mind.

654
00:43:57,716 --> 00:44:00,734
- I don't think that's the way to go anymore.
- Team Angel.

655
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:03,177
Spain?

656
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:05,924
Running.
Italy.

657
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,242
Running!
Norway.

658
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:11,583
Running.
Denmark.

659
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:13,486
Running.
Sweden.

660
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:17,301
- That hurts!
- Stop blurting out the wrong answers!

661
00:44:17,302 --> 00:44:19,569
- I have to get the answer.
- Take your time.

662
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,827
- Take a little rest, Jae Suk.
- Which country haven't you mentioned yet?

663
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,773
What else is there in Europe?
Let's see...

664
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,525
Swiss?

665
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:34,129
Team Angel.
Netherlands?

666
00:44:37,863 --> 00:44:41,683
- Russia?
- What did you say?

667
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,997
[Correct answer]

668
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:50,187
[A round around Europe,
and finally gets the correct answer!]

669
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,869
[Two wins in a row for Hae Hyo!]

670
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,631
[Remaining players- 7:5.]

671
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:01,447
They just had the Winter Olympics in Sochi,
and they're having the World Cup too?

672
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,362
Don't you think that you're being
too good at this game?

673
00:45:04,363 --> 00:45:06,552
[We ask that you judge more fairly
during the World Cup games...]

674
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,079
[Hae Hyo eliminates four player of Team RM-
Remaining players- 6:3.]

675
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,607
- Gu Hye Sun!
- Gu Hye Sun can choose the category.

676
00:45:16,608 --> 00:45:18,568
You can choose since you're
the challenger.

677
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:22,278
- Rescue Team.
- Rescue Team?

678
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:27,091
[Hye Sun played a rescue guard in
the drama, 'Angel Eyes'.]

679
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,945
She even took classes.
It could be related to that.

680
00:45:28,946 --> 00:45:34,235
- It could be something that she learned.
- Finish listening to the question first.

681
00:45:34,236 --> 00:45:35,607
Here's your question.

682
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,853
When the rescue helicopter is called out

683
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:44,721
what is the signal that the person in need
gives out to indicate that they need rescuing?

684
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:48,088
What is the signal?

685
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:54,575
[Do you know what it is?]

686
00:45:54,576 --> 00:45:57,240
[I don't know either.]

687
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:04,163
- Neither one of them knows.
- Didn't you play a rescue guard?

688
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:08,575
- Blank Ji Hyo!
- I'm curious to know myself.

689
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:10,868
Is it an object that is used?

690
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:14,333
Either a prop or your own body.
Something you can signal with your own body.

691
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,399
Running.
Hand.

692
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:18,955
What are you talking about?

693
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:29,968
[Wave to the rescuers out of sheer joy?]

694
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,730
'X'?

695
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,063
[Seung Ri and his out of the blue
bodily gags.]

696
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:55,450
No one seemed to be talking, so...

697
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:58,627
[Lightens the mood with his joke.]

698
00:46:58,628 --> 00:47:00,685
- You're pretty close to the answer.
- Just say whatever comes to your mind.

699
00:47:00,686 --> 00:47:02,535
Running.
'X'.

700
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:04,690
- 'X'.
- That answer was already given.

701
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:06,869
That answer was already given!

702
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:12,255
[Sorry...]

703
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:14,951
- Angel. '11'.
- '11'?

704
00:47:14,952 --> 00:47:16,445
'11'?

705
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,933
Running.
'Mansei' (Figure of '11'.)

706
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,039
How is that any different from '11'?

707
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:30,628
What is a person to do
if they've hurt their arms?

708
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,694
Angel!'
'V'?

709
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:36,050
'V'?

710
00:47:40,506 --> 00:47:43,648
[Hye Sun wins the round.]

711
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,819
The correct answer is, the sign of a 'V'.

712
00:47:47,855 --> 00:47:51,648
- We only have two players left.
- Who's the next challenger?

713
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,103
That's me.

714
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:55,041
You dare laugh?

715
00:47:55,042 --> 00:48:02,307
- You're just giving up, aren't you?
- You don't know what you're saying.

716
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:04,056
They've pretty much given up.

717
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:08,013
- How about 'Reporter'? Or 'Chef'?
- No, Hye Sun is a really good cook.

718
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:09,365
[Hye Sun is too good of a cook
to go with that category.]

719
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:11,497
- Go with 'Producer'.
- Producer?

720
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:15,132
[But 'Producer' is iffy with
Hye Sun being a movie director.]

721
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:19,684
How about 'Scientist'?
No, just go with 'Reporter'.

722
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:21,804
There's nothing I can do.

723
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:25,516
- Go with 'Reporter'. That's your best option.
- Reporter!

724
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,500
[Time for them to win this round!]

725
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:34,039
- You should take them all down, Ha Ha.
- That would be awesome.

726
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,187
- You can do it!
- What is Team Running Man so confident about?

727
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:48,779
We have to be on the show
every single week.

728
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,531
[We've been coming on the show every week
for the past four years.]

729
00:48:52,853 --> 00:48:55,301
You sure are lucky, Ji Suk.

730
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,467
[Ji Suk hasn't shown off his airheaded side
all thanks to his smart teammates.]

731
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:08,025
The topic is... entertainment news.

732
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:09,549
[Entertainment]

733
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,845
- We can do this!
- You're all set!

734
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:22,427
It's a question based on statistics
in the industry.

735
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:27,606
What is the name of the actor who's made
the most number of appearances

736
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:32,927
as a foreign actor guest on various shows
on SBS network in the last 20 years?

737
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:36,028
- Who is that actor/actress?
- You know this one!

738
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,837
Please!

739
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:40,202
Ki Chan.

740
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:42,126
[Huh?]

741
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:48,855
[Could our faraway friend, Jackie Chan,
be the correct answer?]

742
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:57,992
[The formidable ace in the
entertainment category, Ha Ha.]

743
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:03,425
[Jackie Chan came in at first place for
having made ten separate appearances.]

744
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:05,081
Make some noise!

745
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:08,875
Gu Hye Sun.

746
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,495
- How many of you are there now?
- We have four left.

747
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:17,650
[Team Angel still has five players!]

748
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,468
I'm going to choose the 'Actor' category.

749
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,639
[Ha Ha has experience in
being in a movie himself.]

750
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,163
You're competing against a man who started
with the movie, 'Not the Hamburger Level'.

751
00:50:29,337 --> 00:50:32,259
[He made his debut 26 years ago in a movie.]

752
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,781
That movie came out
when I was in middle school.

753
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,327
Were you in the movie as an extra?

754
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:46,066
- Why don't you answer it first then?
- Okay, deal!

755
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:50,578
Here's the question.
What are the four elements in acting?

756
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,179
- What are the four elements in acting?
- Seriously!

757
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:03,325
[It seems as though Ji Suk knows
the answer.]

758
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,692
Four elements of acting?

759
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:07,463
[Four elements of acting.]

760
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:15,210
[Audience, stage, actor, storyline.]

761
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:19,564
Second element is...

762
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:21,028
Stage.

763
00:51:22,237 --> 00:51:24,143
[Huh? Look at this guy...]

764
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:27,279
There are two elements left, right?

765
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:31,175
Rent. It's the rent.

766
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,749
[Big-nose is saying the realistic elements
of acting such as management fees, and rent.]

767
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:40,746
- Management fees.
- Actor.

768
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:45,502
[Ha Ha has answered
three of the four correct elements.]

769
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,847
I'm sure everyone's shocked with
my answers so far.

770
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:51,695
- Yes, we're very shocked.
- The last one should be crucial.

771
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:54,806
It would be so funny if I said it was
the admission fees right now.

772
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,013
Audience, stage, actor...

773
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:04,485
Stage, audience, actor, entrance.

774
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:06,159
Entrance.

775
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:15,188
[Three out of four was correct.
So close...]

776
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:17,149
Audience, stage, actor, storyline.

777
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:27,199
[Ha Ha didn't know the final element,
the storyline.]

778
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,047
I had no idea that he'd even know
those three elements.

779
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:34,097
[Only one challenger left on Team RM.]

780
00:52:34,098 --> 00:52:36,969
[The final challenger of Team Rm- Kkuk.]

781
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:44,565
- Your brother is a doctor, so go with that.
- My brother is the doctor, not me!

782
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:45,989
[Very simple, yet logical reason.]

783
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:48,759
My brother's the doctor, not me!

784
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,784
You don't have any attorneys in the family,
but you do have a doctor, right?

785
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,241
So go with the 'Doctor' category.

786
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:54,628
Doctor!

787
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,071
[Kkuk chooses the 'doctor' category.]

788
00:52:59,883 --> 00:53:03,211
- Ji Suk needs to go up there.
- No, it's alright.

789
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:05,402
I want to see Ji Suk go up there.

790
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:07,999
[The opposing team really wants to see
Ji Suk go up to the stand.]

791
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,351
The topic is... 'Diseases'.

792
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:17,137
What is it called when a patient is always
diagnosing himself with new symptoms?

793
00:53:17,138 --> 00:53:18,722
- Angel.
- Running.

794
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:22,802
Obsession.

795
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:36,045
He did too well in the beginning that we were
fooled into thinking otherwise of Hyung Jin.

796
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,518
Running.
Stalking.

797
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:48,494
- You definitely are not a doctor.
- Not new 'ideal person', but 'symptoms'.

798
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:52,136
- State the question accurately.
- Okay.

799
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:55,700
- It's some sort of illness?
- It's an illness, right?

800
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:59,383
- It's an illness, right?
- Answer!

801
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:01,806
Answer!
The blues syndrome?

802
00:54:02,924 --> 00:54:04,889
The blues syndrome?

803
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:16,133
[Players left- 4:1.]

804
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:20,194
- Where did I hear that from?
- From when your brother was in med school.

805
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:23,925
- I remember hearing about that somewhere.
- You got it!

806
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:26,661
Where did I hear that from?
I wonder if it was from a movie.

807
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:29,905
[Moment of joy is just temporary.
Seoul University Alumni is up next.]

808
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:33,266
Wait and see which topic
he chooses.

809
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,391
We just need to beat Sang Yoon.

810
00:54:35,392 --> 00:54:38,270
[It's the airhead's turn as long as
they can beat Sang Yoon.]

811
00:54:39,038 --> 00:54:43,585
Don't choose that one.
He was a physics major!

812
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:46,123
He was a physics major!

813
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:49,957
[Kkuk only chose the category because
it was somewhat health related.]

814
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:51,782
AS soon as we're over this hump,
it's all downhill from here.

815
00:54:51,783 --> 00:54:53,584
It's all downhill!

816
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:56,433
- Why is it a downhill from there?
- Ji Suk is up next.

817
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:59,307
- Okay, I got this.
- Think of this as a bobsled game.

818
00:54:59,308 --> 00:55:02,027
[It's an airhead bobsled game
from here on out.]

819
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:03,844
You have to win this, Sang Yoon.

820
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:07,692
This is unfair.

821
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,632
The topic is... living organisms.

822
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:11,483
[Topic- Living organisms.]

823
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:14,077
- Are you not as familiar with that topic?
- Yes.

824
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,276
That's a relief.
That's a real relief to hear.

825
00:55:17,466 --> 00:55:18,768
Here's your question.

826
00:55:19,474 --> 00:55:25,694
In order for an exoskeleton insect to grow,
they go through a molten stage.

827
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:29,271
How can you make that the question when
that's the only thing I'm sure he knows?

828
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:31,887
- Transformation.
- What did you say?

829
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,261
Transformation was your answer?

830
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:43,696
[That's not in the correct context.]
('Byuntae' can also mean, 'Pervert'.)

831
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,299
In order for an exoskeleton insect to grow,
they go through a molten stage.

832
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:53,016
What is the terminology that is used to
describe the major difference between

833
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:58,461
the morphological difference between
the larvae and the adult insect?

834
00:55:58,496 --> 00:56:00,115
- Running.
- Mutation?

835
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:04,275
- Is it a Korean word?
- Jong Kook.

836
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:06,674
Jong Kook!
Jong Kook!

837
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:09,247
- Jong Kook!
- To be more clear...

838
00:56:09,248 --> 00:56:11,783
- You need to settle down, Yoo Jae Suk.
- Jong Kook!

839
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,005
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

840
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:18,913
You can't look behind you.

841
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:20,890
- It's a Korean word.
- It is?

842
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:25,207
A butterfly is an example of an insect
that goes through this.

843
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,452
[Halts Sang Yoon out of natural instinct.]

844
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:36,567
And grasshopper is an example of an insect
that does not go through this.

845
00:56:39,277 --> 00:56:42,302
Is that right?
Butterflies and grasshoppers?

846
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:44,669
I don't really know much about
grasshoppers.

847
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:48,213
Answer.
I mean, Running.

848
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:52,547
I think Sang Yoon's too scared to
even lift up his hand right now.

849
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:55,809
Abstract metamorphosis?

850
00:56:57,129 --> 00:56:59,307
[What in the world is that?]

851
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:05,446
- Team Angel?
- Variant metamorphosis.

852
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:15,259
Answer. Running. Heterogeneity...
heterogeneity metamorphosis.

853
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:20,519
Angel.
Complete metamorphosis.

854
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,459
Complete metamorphosis.

855
00:57:23,249 --> 00:57:25,835
[Sang Yoon gets the correct answer.]

856
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:36,303
[Victor in ease...
and his happy bobsled team.]

857
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:39,846
[Asking for best out of three.]

858
00:57:41,676 --> 00:57:43,622
Can we just finish up
the remaining categories?

859
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:46,062
[Team Running Man is not very good
at admitting their defeat.]

860
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,385
How about a one on one between
Ji Suk and Kwang Soo.

861
00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:50,735
Let's let Ji Suk and Kwang Soo
go up against each other.

862
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:55,025
[Kim Ji Suk vs Lee Kwang Soo-
Super-match round?]

863
00:57:55,026 --> 00:57:57,901
If Kim Ji Suk wins,
then Team Angel wins, no questions asked.

864
00:57:57,902 --> 00:58:00,455
But if Lee Kwang Soo happens to win...

865
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:04,840
then I'll allow for one more round with
only three players from each team.

866
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:06,466
- Okay.
- Will that be okay?

867
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:09,097
- The two teams can decide.
- Should we allow it?

868
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:12,730
Then we want Kim Jong Kook to come out
and beg us on his knees for his whole team.

869
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:20,975
- We'll have him get down on his knees!
- Why is that so hard? Look how easy it is!

870
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:27,492
[A group demonstration of how easy it is
to beg down on their knees.]

871
00:58:27,493 --> 00:58:29,766
We want Kim Jong Kook down
on his knees.

872
00:58:30,984 --> 00:58:33,280
I can get down on my knees.

873
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:35,746
[Kkuk's self-sacrifice for the chance
for their team to redeem themselves.]

874
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,011
[Thanks to Kkuk, it's now a battle
between Ji Suk and Kwang Soo.]

875
00:58:40,012 --> 00:58:42,300
- I'll end this right now.
- You can do this, Kwang Soo.

876
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:44,638
I vow to defeat him!

877
00:58:45,657 --> 00:58:48,162
I'm going to win this!

878
00:58:48,163 --> 00:58:50,284
All the categories are
pretty much the same to you.

879
00:58:51,434 --> 00:58:53,351
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.

880
00:58:53,675 --> 00:58:56,861
[Ji Suk wins the right
to choose the category.]

881
00:58:58,646 --> 00:59:01,099
- How about 'Teacher'?
- Aren't you a teacher?

882
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,166
Okay, I will choose 'Teacher',
since I graduated with an education degree.

883
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:06,311
[Chooses a category related to
his education degree background.]

884
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:10,302
- Ji Suk has a degree in education?
- I even have a teaching certificate.

885
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:13,927
Jong Kook is going to kill you
if you lose, Kwang Soo.

886
00:59:13,928 --> 00:59:16,031
- That would be fun.
- I didn't make him get down on his knees.

887
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,225
Just know that you'll be crawling on
your knees until we're done filming.

888
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:24,723
[Kwang Soo's knees for Jong Kook's.]

889
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:27,353
Let's take this seriously.

890
00:59:27,354 --> 00:59:28,401
The topic is...

891
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:33,129
- Novels.
- Okay, novels.

892
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:38,473
I may not know about anything else,
but I know my novels.

893
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,640
What are we going to do about him?

894
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:46,095
In the novel,
'Mother and the Love Guests'...

895
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:47,863
You know that book.

896
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:50,252
I have a feeling that
Ji Suk may get this right.

897
00:59:51,018 --> 00:59:52,409
Running.

898
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,735
- Potatoes.
- Angel!

899
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:56,799
[Where did the potatoes come from?]

900
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,255
Eggs... I mean,
two hardboiled eggs.

901
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:02,435
He's a weirdo himself.

902
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,962
Listen to what the question is first!

903
01:00:08,963 --> 01:00:10,703
Three fried eggs.

904
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:15,732
Running!
Poached eggs. Poached eggs?

905
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:19,036
- Listen to the question first!
- Let him finish asking the question!

906
01:00:19,037 --> 01:00:21,938
Running.
Two potatoes, and three eggs.

907
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,098
Hey!
It's not an American style breakfast!

908
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:33,490
She didn't serve him
an American style breakfast.

909
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:36,375
[Did she serve her guests an
American style breakfast?]

910
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:40,718
[Why don't you wait to answer until you've
finished listening to the question first?]

911
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:47,106
What is the instrument that the mother played
for her customers in the novel?

912
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:48,163
Running!

913
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:51,362
[Darn... I was one step too late.]

914
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:53,632
Gayageum.

915
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:00,384
Angel.

916
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:03,291
An organ.

917
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,206
Organ.

918
01:01:07,328 --> 01:01:10,556
[Kim Ji Suk wins!]

919
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:16,020
[Someone please help me.]

920
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:20,328
[I can't believe I lost to Ji Suk...]

921
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:24,575
I wasn't going to resort to this.

922
01:01:27,353 --> 01:01:31,154
[Mission card containing
the next mission location.]

923
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,380
What just happened?

924
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,390
[Team Running Man takes
both the mission cards.]

925
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:40,384
[Eats the opposing team's mission card!]

926
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:42,852
- You can't take our card too!
- Just follow our card.

927
01:01:42,853 --> 01:01:44,734
You can just follow our card.

928
01:01:45,273 --> 01:01:50,261
[For the first time in Running Man history,
the victor has to follow the loser?]

929
01:01:50,262 --> 01:01:52,005
Okay, let's follow them.

930
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:54,421
We'll show you what we're
really made of!

931
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:58,736
[Second round, Quiz Competition-
Team Angel wins!]

932
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:02,863
[Their mission location- Soccer Field.]

933
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:04,542
I wonder what we'll have to do.

934
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:08,669
- It'll be something physical.
- It can be relay or running of sorts.

935
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:15,445
The last time I was on the show,
we did acupuncture mat jumping.

936
01:02:16,854 --> 01:02:19,895
- It was so painful.
- Did it really hurt?

937
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:26,781
But the funny thing is, the day after...
after I got a full night of sleep...

938
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:29,067
When I got up the next morning...

939
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:34,163
My skin... my skin was practically glowing.

940
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:38,027
It really improved my blood circulation.

941
01:02:38,028 --> 01:02:41,418
- I wondered how it could be good for you.
- So it really helped improve your health.

942
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:44,152
I felt like it opened up all my veins
for better blood circulation.

943
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,517
[Those fond memories...]

944
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:51,511
[We'll make you relieve them again.]

945
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,515
[May not what this is all about,
but it's a gigantic acupuncture mat setup.]

946
01:02:56,025 --> 01:02:59,589
[This has to be a dream.]

947
01:03:03,802 --> 01:03:05,967
Your next match is a physical competition.

948
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:09,227
[Round three-
Acupuncture mat competition.]

949
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:12,425
[A world where whatever they say
becomes a reality.]

950
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,287
It's the acupuncture mat again.

951
01:03:15,555 --> 01:03:20,695
[Since the weather is so cold,
we'll allow you to keep your socks on.]

952
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,951
[Onto the mat with your sock-clad feet.]

953
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:29,303
It still feels the same!

954
01:03:31,823 --> 01:03:36,570
[Feel the healthy benefits flowing
through their thin socks.]

955
01:03:37,254 --> 01:03:39,472
Maybe I should put on two pairs of socks.

956
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,074
Wearing these socks aren't making
any difference for me.

957
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:45,742
[Acupuncture mats that they can't even fathom
having to face in dramas.]

958
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:51,006
- It's a teeny bit better.
- It really hurts! It makes no difference!

959
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:55,256
Song Ji Hyo's wearing men's formal socks.

960
01:03:56,686 --> 01:04:00,218
You must've left your house in a hurry,
and just bought a pair from the store.

961
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:03,832
We can't take too long with this game even if
we wanted to because of the level of pain.

962
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:07,278
I bet Ji Suk's true nature will come out
during this round.

963
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,080
[Acupuncture mat competition- Start!]

964
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:13,811
I'm coming.

965
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:16,962
- We have to win this time.
- I know.

966
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:23,461
[The shortening gap between the two teams.]

967
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,045
[Jae Suk seems to be their first target.]

968
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:35,615
Don't step on my foot!
Why are you stepping on my foot?

969
01:04:40,963 --> 01:04:44,233
[Everyone's stepping on each other's feet.]

970
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:01,893
[Discouraging the opponents by
stepping on their feet.]

971
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:11,871
[The more you get stepped on,
the bigger the health benefits.]

972
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:21,125
[If someone becomes too much of a liability,
then abandoning them is the answer.]

973
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:27,091
[Goodbye...]

974
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:34,957
[Team Running Man 6 vs Team Angel 7.]

975
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:39,544
[Once lost, then it's time to abandon.
Jae Suk's elimination shows their true color.]

976
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:42,788
[This team is in celebration mode.]

977
01:05:43,577 --> 01:05:45,700
- Why didn't you save me?
- We couldn't!

01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:47,856
[Team Running Man 6 vs Team Angel 7.]

01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:49,020
My feet hurt!

980
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,358
[Back to hunt for more.]

981
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,614
Tell Suk Jin to come out here.

982
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,657
[Seung Ri is starting to shed tears
from the pain of being on the mat.]

983
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,274
Just make it quick.
Beat them, or lose, just do whatever.

984
01:06:06,218 --> 01:06:07,876
[Attack by stomping on their feet?]

985
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,410
Get in there!

986
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:22,194
[The mat is prohibiting them from attacking,
so it's only a verbal attack!]

987
01:06:30,004 --> 01:06:31,522
Come on!

988
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:36,290
Take your time and come over here.

989

[Tiger is about to be unleashed.]

991

[Putting their faith in the tiger
to shout out in fierce battle cry.]

992
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,837
If Kim Jong Kook wasn't there,
we'd seriously...

993
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:04,199
Come on!

994
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,536
[Martial art-like hand moves.]

995
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,318
Nice, Gary!

996
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:15,236
[Got him!]

997
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,726
[Human tug-of-war.]

998

[An enormous round of elimination!]

1001
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:57,417
[This is Tiger Power!]

1002
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:02,558
[In a blink of an eye,
it's reduced down to three against two.]

1003
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,718
Four of them fell off all at once.

1004
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,804
You come here.

1005
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,484

[Kwang Soo vs Hae Hyo.
One on one battle.]

1007

[Leg tripping?]

1008
01:08:35,454 --> 01:08:38,254
[Eliminates the Giraffe in one
smooth move!]

1009
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:42,516
- He is allowed to do that?
- Why can't he?

1010
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,097
I love you, Kwon Hae Hyo!

1011
01:08:49,031 --> 01:08:53,172
I don't know what to do about this.
I really am a huge fan of his.

1012

[Hae Hyo seems to be practicing
the drunken martial arts move.]

1013
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:59,982
- We're losing right now.
- I've seen every drama that he's been in.

1014
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:03,159
- I'm serious. Every single one of them.
- Hae Hyo's putting on an act right now.

1015
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,240
He's acting right now.
He used to practice martial arts!

1016
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:09,037
- He really knows martial arts.
- He used to be an action star.

1017
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:12,996
[Former action star's trickery.]

1018
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,541

so that Jong Kook can't get a hold of him.]

1019
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:21,497
- He really knows the martial arts?
- You need to be careful, Ji Hyo.

1020

[Everyone enjoying being
a spectator to this showdown.]

1023
01:09:37,322 --> 01:09:39,520
Just eliminate him
so that he can rest in peace!

1024
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:51,880
[Former action star's disgrace.]

1025
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:54,716
Don't you think that you've gone too far?

1026
01:09:55,544 --> 01:09:59,483
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1027
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:03,360
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo vs Hye Sun.]

01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:34,375
Ji Hyo, if you don't end it right now,
Jong Kook will lose to her.

1032
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:46,852
- You have to get this done!
- Want me to help lift her?

1033
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,446
[The last survivor, Hye Sun,
is also ousted.]

[But she still shocked everyone
with her courageous attack.]

1035
01:10:56,593 --> 01:11:00,458
It's been a while since I've seen anyone
attack Ji Hyo like that.

1036
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:04,770
So they can beat us as long as it's
a simple physical competition.

1037
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:07,161
[Team Running Man wins the third round-
Acupuncture mat competition.]

[They finally arrive at
the final mission location.]

1040
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:23,342
I remember having been here before.
What is all this?

1041
01:11:24,004 --> 01:11:26,792
Look at that.
They have a huge set built over there.

1042
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:29,285
Look at that.
Don't people jump off of those things?

1043

[The final stage to determine who will
be the ultimate rescue team.]

1044
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:41,144
This is your final mission destination,
which is the Firefighter Academy.

1045
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:44,012
This is your final competition.

1046
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:46,819
Final competition to choose which team
will become the ultimate rescue team.

1047
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:53,149
Currently, Team Angel has 2 and Team RM has
1 priority choice cards from previous rounds.

1048
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:57,162
[Fire extinguisher vs Bucket;
Rope vs Hands; 5M vs 7M.]

1049

[Team Angel gets to choose
two of those cards.]

1050
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:02,669
When we did our last race
with the university students

1051
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,657
the teams that got to choose first
were the last ones to come in.

1052
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:07,833
- Yes, that's right.
- Who knew the blanket boat would win?

1053
01:12:08,896 --> 01:12:12,981
- How about we go with the hand one?
- Okay. Okay!

1054
01:12:12,982 --> 01:12:14,649
We've made our decision.

1055
01:12:15,718 --> 01:12:20,344
Between the fire extinguisher and the bucket,
we'll go with the fire extinguisher.

1056
01:12:20,345 --> 01:12:24,970
- Come on, the bucket would be much better!
- We're sure it'll be extinguishing a fire.

1057
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:28,412
And in case of 5M vs 7M...
we're going to go with 5M.

1058
01:12:30,587 --> 01:12:34,376
- Let's go with the rope.
- Okay, we choose the rope.

1059
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:37,696
- So everyone's made their decisions.
- Are we going to have to climb something?

1060
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:40,083
But we still don't know if it's a good thing
or a bad thing yet.

1061
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:43,263
You guys mentioned the Han River crossing
mission we did recently a little bit ago.

1062
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:48,382
That idea for that mission was given to us by
the world's oddest paper boat competition.

1063
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:51,926
Our final competition of the day is also from
an 'oddest world competition' that goes on.

1064
01:12:51,927 --> 01:12:54,016
Can't you just get something
from a regular competition?

1065
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:57,190
Instead of from an odd competition?
Why are you always looking for something odd?

1066
01:12:57,191 --> 01:13:00,125
- Then what is this competition about?
- This odd competition is about...

1067
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,774
This is from the world's oddest
firefighter competition.

1068
01:13:02,775 --> 01:13:05,209
- That sounds okay.
- That actually sounds pretty cool.

1069
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,184
[Firefighter Olympics which determines
the best firefighters in the world.]

1070
01:13:08,185 --> 01:13:14,348
[ A competition to determine the best of
the best through a series of games.]

1071
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:17,397
We tweaked the games a bit to
suit us better

1072
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:21,980
and seven members on each team will now play
the game as the real firefighters would.

1073
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:25,198
Here are the rules of the competition.

1074
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:27,714
There are a total of six obstacles.

1075
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:35,192
First course- First runner will slide down
the pole to run over to the second runner.

1076
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:38,240
Second Course- First runner will run over to
the second obstacle

1077
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:43,388
with the second runner on their piggyback
for the second obstacle course

1078
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:46,781
which is the barefoot fire walking course.

1079
01:13:46,782 --> 01:13:48,731
Fire walking?

1080
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,799
It is just like it sounds.
You'll have to walk on fire.

1081
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,978
[Walk barefoot on hot coals and stones with
the first runner on their piggyback.]

1082
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:00,020
Here's the third mission.

1083
01:14:00,564 --> 01:14:08,170
You'll have to utilize either the bucket or
the fire extinguisher that you got to choose

1084
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:10,682
to extinguish the fire roaring
in the steel over that you see over there.

1085
01:14:10,683 --> 01:14:12,899
[Third obstacle- Fire extinguishing.]

1086
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,354
Fireman standing by will ensure
that the fire has been put out completely.

1087
01:14:16,355 --> 01:14:21,803
Only once the fireman has deemed it okay,
will the next runner will be able to go.

1088
01:14:22,593 --> 01:14:28,268
For the fourth obstacle,
the fourth runner will climb up the roof.

1089
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:33,638
And for this course as well,
you will have to use either your hands or rope

1090
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:36,377
as you've chosen from the options
that you were given earlier.

1091
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:39,943
[The team that chose the rope is
cheering with joy.]

1092
01:14:42,115 --> 01:14:48,363
For the fifth course, fifth and sixth runners
will have to combine their efforts together.

1093
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:52,039
The two runners will have to combine their
efforts together to work the fire hose.

1094
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,616
The two must work together to aim and
knockdown their target from its position.

1095
01:14:55,617 --> 01:15:00,569
Team Angel chose 5M and
Team Running Man chose 7M.

1096
01:15:02,402 --> 01:15:06,381
And here's your final obstacle course.

1097
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:11,689
the seventh runner must climb up the wall
to ring the bell located up near the top.

1098
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:15,974
The first team to ring the bell
will be today's winning team.

1099
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:21,844
This is a relay where the previous runner will
have to stick the name tag on the next runner.

1100
01:15:23,033 --> 01:15:24,851
That's how this relay will be played.

1101
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:29,171
[Time to practice their moves.]

1102
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,559
- Just slide down like this.
- Is it hot on your hands?

1103
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,017
- No, it's not hot.
- I'll give it a try.

1104
01:15:36,094 --> 01:15:40,238
[Gary is teaching Ji Hyo how to
slide down the pole.]

1105
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:43,344
- There you go. Good job.
- Like this?

1106
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:45,556
- Did I do okay?
- Yeah, great job.

1107
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:47,409
- You did good.
- Ouch, that hurts.

1108
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,704
You're our Ace, who can do anything!

1109
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,227
[For Team Angel, Seung Ri is in charge
of sliding down the pole.]

1110
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:57,129
- You have to stick on my name tag, okay?
- Okay.

1111
01:15:58,211 --> 01:16:07,126
[But... how am I going to manage that?]

1112
01:16:09,095 --> 01:16:12,083
How am I going to put
the fire out with just a bucket?

1113
01:16:12,084 --> 01:16:14,714
Putting that fire out isn't going
to be easy.

1114
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:17,345
You have to just hold on to the bottom
when you pull out the safety pin.

1115
01:16:17,346 --> 01:16:20,380
There's a lower and an upper handle,
but hold onto only the bottom portion

1116
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:23,861
and you'll be able to pull out
the safety pin just like this.

1117
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:26,117
- Do you understand?
- And just press the handles together?

1118
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:28,570
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.

1119

[Sang Yoon and Jong Kook.
Competing at the roof climbing obstacle.]

1120
01:16:32,028 --> 01:16:33,415
It's not easy.

1121
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:36,813
- Wow, this is really slippery.
- This isn't easy.

1122
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:42,584
[Sang Yoon barely manages to
pull himself up onto the roof.]

1123
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:45,715
Sang Yoon's good at climbing up there,
but he doesn't look all that cool.

1124
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,326
[He's going to exhaust himself out
from all that practicing.]

1125
01:16:57,078 --> 01:16:59,152
[But he seems to have gotten
the hang of it.]

1126

[Fifth course-
Knock the target down with the hose.]

1127
01:17:05,344 --> 01:17:07,720
We have to do it forcefully?

01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:11,313
It's all the weaklings over here.

1129
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:15,878
[Predicting a fierce battle
between the weakest links.]

1130
01:17:18,161 --> 01:17:22,062
When the two partners come up here
together once everything's been setup

1131
01:17:22,063 --> 01:17:26,839
then one of you will have to look over to
that person, and yell out, 'water'.

1132
01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:30,425
[Learning how to work the water hose.]

1133
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:32,402
If you open it too much,
then it'll go all over the place.

1134
01:17:32,403 --> 01:17:34,636
So just open it up slightly?

1135
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:37,688
Open too wide, then it's like this,
and open a little, and it's a narrow stream.

1136
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:40,753
It's just like when we would play with
the garden hose when we were kids.

1137
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,404
I shouldn't have taken on this course.

1138
01:17:44,851 --> 01:17:47,588
- Have you ever done this before, Ha Neul?
- Me?

1139
01:17:47,589 --> 01:17:51,122
- For about a year and a half?
- That's cheating!

1140
01:17:51,123 --> 01:17:53,133
You doing this is cheating!

1141
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:54,958
But I forgot how to do it.
It's been so long.

1142
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:02,356
I shouldn't have said I was
going to do this.

1143
01:18:02,357 --> 01:18:03,927
What was I thinking?

1144
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:06,543
Is it too late to change my mind now?

1145
01:18:10,803 --> 01:18:13,237
- The fire feels so warm.
- Jae Suk.

1146
01:18:14,299 --> 01:18:15,633
Jae Suk.

1147
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:17,634
- Want to do my course?
- Why?

1148
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:22,667
[Hoping for a chance to swap out his course
after being fitted for the equipment?]

1149
01:18:22,668 --> 01:18:24,139
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

1150
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:29,401
- I was wondering if you'd be interested.
- But you have such long legs.

1151
01:18:29,402 --> 01:18:32,952
And did you see the shoes?
You need climbing shoes.

1152
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:35,497
- Your shoes are very important.
- Do you have climbing shoes?

1153
01:18:36,289 --> 01:18:37,784
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1154
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:40,306
- Don't you carry them around?
- Who would carry them around?

1155
01:18:40,307 --> 01:18:41,445
You should always carry them
around with you.

1156
01:18:41,446 --> 01:18:47,919
You always have to carry certain pairs of
shoes around with you in this industry.

1157
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,171
[Don't you know the basics
of the variety industry?]

1158
01:18:49,172 --> 01:18:51,193
You should always be ready for anything.

1159
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:53,335
- When would I ever go climbing?
- What's your shoe size?

1160
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:55,584
- 290mm.
- Then mine wouldn't even fit you.

1161
01:18:56,509 --> 01:19:00,511
- You have a pair with you?
- Of course! We all have them with us.

1162
01:19:00,512 --> 01:19:02,772
You have to carry all sorts of shoes,
such as bowling shoes at all times.

1163
01:19:02,773 --> 01:19:05,622
[Unbelievable]

1164
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:07,472
You never know when you'll need them.

1165
01:19:07,473 --> 01:19:10,124
Nothing we can do about today.
Just do it without them today.

1166
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,398
But let's go to this store I know and
get you a pair for next time.

1167
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:15,055
Let's get you a pair for you
to take around.

1168
01:19:15,056 --> 01:19:19,048
[I guess you're going to have to buy a few
things if you want to stay in this industry.]

1169
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:20,781
You need to get yourself a pair.

1170
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:24,421
[The final competition]

1171
01:19:26,419 --> 01:19:29,041
[Ultimate firefighter competition.]

1172
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:38,473
[First obstacle- Pole sliding.
Ji Hyo vs Seung Ri.]

1173
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:41,522
[A fierce battle where the pride of the variety
and drama departments are riding on the line.]

1174
01:19:45,075 --> 01:19:49,650
[Second obstacle- Fire walking.

1175
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:56,565

[Sixth course- Rockwall climbing.

1179
01:20:07,817 --> 01:20:09,244
Get ready.

1180
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:19,507
[Which team will take home the honor?]

1181
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:30,782
[Ji Hyo vs Seung Ri.
First course- Pole sliding.]

1182
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:35,045
You're doing great, Ji Hyo!

1183
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:36,924
Please!

1184
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,573
[Neck and neck!]

1185
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:45,113
[Almost at the same time!]

1186
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:47,935
They're so close!

1187
01:20:48,397 --> 01:20:51,186
[Ace Ji Hyo doesn't lose out to any man!]

1188
01:20:53,535 --> 01:20:55,118
It's neck and neck!

1189
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,519
Neck and neck!

1190
01:20:57,775 --> 01:21:00,625
[Second obstacle- Fire walking.]

1191
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:24,359
[Third obstacle- Fire extinguishing.]

1192
01:21:25,155 --> 01:21:28,857
[Team Running Man- Bucket.
Team Angel- Fire extinguisher.]

1193
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:32,401
[Double bucket action.]

1194
01:21:36,263 --> 01:21:38,655
[Hye Sun is struggling
to pull out the safety pin.]

1195
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:48,439
[The fireman must lift up his flag in
acknowledgment for them to pass.]

1196
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,534
- You have to put it all out!
- Put it all out!

1197
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:57,800
[Jae Suk continues to run back and forth.]

1198
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:03,518
[Just then... Hye Sun succeeds her mission.]

1199
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:07,339
[Team Running Man also succeeds the mission
right in Team Angel's footsteps.]

1200
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:13,020
[Both teams rush off to the fourth obstacle-
Roof climbing.]

1201
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:23,330
[Jong Kook and Sang Yoon
get on their way simultaneously.]

1202
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:27,594
[This roof climbing obstacle could determine
which team comes out the winner!]

1203
01:22:30,432 --> 01:22:33,616
[Team Angel- Hands.
Team Running Man- Rope.]

1204
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,691
[Tiger power in full effect!]

1205
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,371
[Kkuk climbs up onto the roof in
a blink of an eye with his rope.]

1206
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:50,828
What's taking Sang Yoon so long?

1207
01:23:00,872 --> 01:23:04,099
[Maybe he exhausted himself out
too much during practice?]

1208
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,582
Sang Yoon looks so uncool right now.

1209
01:23:10,989 --> 01:23:12,941
[His grunting is his only reply.]

1210
01:23:13,567 --> 01:23:15,554
[Oh no...]

1211
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:22,780
Sang Yoon!

1212
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:25,038
[Even the opposing team
starts to cheer him on.]

1213
01:23:26,553 --> 01:23:28,871
I don't think I can climb up there.
It's way too high.

1214
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:34,684
[Meanwhile, Team Running Man is about to
get started with their fifth course.]

1215
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:38,223
- Hurry up and stick it on.
- Got it. Let's hurry!

1216
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:40,487
[Big-nose's hose rolling skills.]

1217
01:23:41,489 --> 01:23:46,149
[Fireman Big-nose gets it done right!]

1218
01:23:47,169 --> 01:23:50,264
[Team Running Man has to knock down
their target from 7M away.]

1219
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:55,111
[Sang Yoon, on the other hand...]

1220
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,169
[He's still battling with the rooftop.]

1221
01:23:59,943 --> 01:24:02,527
Just a little bit more.
There you go, Sang Yoon.

1222
01:24:02,528 --> 01:24:04,761
You got it.

1223
01:24:06,694 --> 01:24:08,563
You need to hurry!
The other team got through the roof!

1224
01:24:08,564 --> 01:24:11,487
- Grab it over here.
- Water!

1225
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:15,898
[Team Angel is right on their heels.]

1226
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:24,199
[I can't be the cause of our team's loss...]

1227
01:24:26,452 --> 01:24:28,017
[Ready to take aim.]

1228
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:34,155
Hold it steady.

1229
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:37,369
[Must knock down their target with
the stream of water to pass.]

1230
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:42,021
[Will it be knocked down?]

1231
01:24:42,022 --> 01:24:45,995
Aim it higher!
You have to aim higher!

1232
01:24:48,726 --> 01:24:51,311
[Team Running Man-
Passes through the fifth course!]

1233
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:55,379
[Only one final obstacle left to go!]

1234
01:24:57,032 --> 01:24:58,780
Lee Kwang Soo, fighting!

1235
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:01,749
- Lee Kwang Soo, fighting!
- I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this!

1236
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,789
This is too big of a burden on me!

1237
01:25:04,624 --> 01:25:06,117
Water!

1238
01:25:07,591 --> 01:25:12,699
[What?
It's a rainbow shower.]

1239
01:25:14,641 --> 01:25:16,710
If you open it up too much,
then it'll spread sideways.

1240
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:21,604
[He definitely told them
not to open it up too much.]

1241
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:25,539
[So this is what he meant by that...]

1242
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:29,298
[The two firemen are battling the water hose.]

1243
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:44,217
- Stick it on his back!
- Go!

1244
01:25:44,218 --> 01:25:47,949
[The final obstacle- Rockwall climbing.]

1245
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,249
Okay, we've got this!
We can win this thing!

1246
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,404
[Everything is now riding on
Kwang Soo's shoulders.]

1247
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,063
[Must ring the bell, which is placed
10m above his head to win the competition.]

1248
01:25:59,064 --> 01:26:01,338
- You can do this!
- Take your time!

1249
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:06,533
[Team Angel finally figures out how
to work the water hose properly.]

1250
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:08,429
- A little bit higher.
- Okay.

1251
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,995
[Wow! Succeeds the mission in
record time!]

1252
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:14,767
Hurry!

1253
01:26:21,413 --> 01:26:24,535
- Kwang Soo!
- He has a lot of experience doing this.

1254
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:27,894
Kwang Soo's having a hard time with this.
Come on, Kwang Soo!

1255
01:26:31,174 --> 01:26:32,813
You're doing good!

1256
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:37,071
[Ha Neul is climbing
the wall like Spiderman.]

1257
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,392
Ha Neul is just very good at this.

1258
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:45,694
Ha Neul took lessons in Rockwall climbing.

1259
01:26:45,695 --> 01:26:49,333
[A little faster...
and he may take over the lead?]

1260
01:26:50,026 --> 01:26:52,871
- You have to move faster, Kwang Soo!
- I don't know where to grab!

1261
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:00,232
[Ha Neul is right on his trail!]

1262
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:04,057
[So close, yet so far.]

1263
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:06,124
Just ring the bell and drop off!

1264
01:27:07,272 --> 01:27:13,053
[Just who... will ring the bell first?]

1265
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:18,007
[With the pride of drama
and variety department on the line!]

1266
01:27:21,094 --> 01:27:22,712
Come on, Kwang Soo!

1267
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:37,972
[Team Running Man wins the competition!]

1268
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:47,721
[Drunk in the euphoria of their victory!]

1269
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:55,229
- That's disappointing.
- We were so close.

1270
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:58,741
The final winner of this competition is,
Team Running Man.

1271
01:27:58,742 --> 01:28:01,442
[Team Running Man wins the competition!]

1272
01:28:06,309 --> 01:28:09,537
[Golden envelopes to the winning team.]

1273
01:28:09,544 --> 01:28:15,192
- There's really something in there.
- As stated earlier, you get both envelopes.

1274
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:17,750
There's real money in there.

1275
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:21,098
I thought there would be another mission card,
but it's real money in there!

1276
01:28:21,522 --> 01:28:23,933
I guess I'll go out to a nice
barbeque dinner.

1277
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:27,285
[You should invite us along!]

1278
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:33,295
Thanks to our guests for joining us, and
we wish you the best with your new drama.
