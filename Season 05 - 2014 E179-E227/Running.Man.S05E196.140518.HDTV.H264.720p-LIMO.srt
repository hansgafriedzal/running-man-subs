[Which time frame would you
like to go back to?]

3
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:10,857
At that time, I was
ousted very early on in the game.

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,711
[Gary- 'At that time, I was ousted
very early on in the game.']

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,597
Just like a person without a future.

6
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:21,097
But I learned that in life...
there are always unexpected events.

7
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:25,545
I wish I could turn back time,
and somehow survive that game.

8
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:28,443
And also, at that moment...

9
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,275
that's when the story of my
victory began.

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,342
[The moment in time that they
desperately want to go back to...]

11
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:43,287
<i>Yoo-ames Bond.</i>

12
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:45,976
<i>I don't know what would happen if I were
able to go back to that moment in time.</i>

[Ji Suk Jin- I'd like to go back to
the Sherlock Holmes episode.]

15
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,537
<i>No!</i>

16
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:58,317
[However...]

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,273
[The further they go back in time,
the more twisted their history becomes.]

18
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:06,715
<i>- January 29th, 2012.

[May, 2014- Sinchon, Seoul.]

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,211
Hello?

23
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,535
Is there anyone around?

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,229
Is there anyone around?

25
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,079
My name tag.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,629
My name tag is gone!

27
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:26,507
[His name tag is gone!]

28
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:37,011
[At the same time, other members of RM
start to come to at various locations.]

29

Wait...

30
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:52,113
I can't help but laugh right now.

31
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,794
[No need to laugh.
Look at this guy over here...]

32
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:59,683
My name tag!

33
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,069
Where did my name tag go?

34
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:06,478
[Running Man members awake to find
their name tags missing from their backs.]

35
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,069
[Just what could've happened
to their name tags?]

36
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:15,737
Wait... what happened to my name tag?
Why is it missing?

37
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,249
What happened?

38
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,386
What's this?

39
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,647
[Discovers a mysterious note in his pocket.]

40
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:26,079
<i>[If you're missing your name tag,
it means that you've been ousted.]</i>

come back to life, then go to this place.]</i>

42
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,727
You're saying that I'm out right now?

43
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:33,905
[Already out of the game
as soon as the game starts?]

44
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:36,510
If you want to come back to life,
then you must go to this place.

45
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,743
What are all these symbols?

46
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,211
What do all these symbols mean?

47
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,226
What does this mean?
Is it a riddle that needs to be solved?

48
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,388
What the heck is this?
Are they kidding me right now?

49
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,941
- Why are they making it so difficult?
- How are we supposed to solve this?

50
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,706
- Are these alien symbols or something?
- My name tag!

51
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,401
Could these be...

52
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,858
some Greek...

53
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:01,035
No, I don't know what these are.

54
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,081
They're like...

55
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,131
hieroglyphics.

56
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,658
They're like hieroglyphics.

57
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,142
Ugh, I can't even ask anyone for help.

58
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:11,257
I think anyone I ask for help
is going to tell me that I'm crazy.

59
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:15,329
Grill?
Am I supposed to find a grill?

60
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,381
Oh? I see EWHA Woman's University.
We must be in Sinchon somewhere.

61
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,261
So I'm in Sinchon right now.

62
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,647
Wait a minute.
EWHA Woman's University.

63
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:28,749
This could stand for 'E'.

64
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,623
So these symbols could mean
EWHA Woman's University.

65
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,892
EWHA Woman's University.

66
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:38,769
So I have to meet 12 students from
EWHA Woman's University...

67
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,057
and do 12 counts of sit-ups?

68
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,178
This is the front gate of
EWHA Woman's University.

69
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,629
Do you by any chance know
where this is pointing to?

70
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,687
- Is it a place within EWHA Woman's University?
- I'm not sure.

71
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,506
- Here?
- Here?

72
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,658
Here?

73
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,828
Here?

74
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,694
Here.

75
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:01,513
- Here.
- Enough!

76
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,876
What am I supposed to do here?
I really don't know!

77
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,060
But... it still feels good to be here.

78
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:12,313
[Seems as though
he just wants to stay 'here'?]

79
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,679
- Hello.
- Jong Kook!

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,517
- Hello.
- You're so handsome!

81
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,879
Can you come here for a minute?

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,179
Can you help me out with something?

83
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,268
We're trying to solve a riddle
right now.

84
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,073
It's a riddle.
I need to figure out this location.

85
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,078
[Jae Suk has been trying to figure it out
on his own for quite a while now.]

86
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,387
Okay, there's one 'o'.

87
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:36,535
And there's either this or that character.

88
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,496
And there are two 'K'.

89
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:46,685
Could it be a pharmacy?
There's one 'o', and two 'k'.

90
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,119
See?
There are two of these characters.

91
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,780
[What is the location that the riddle
is indicating to?]

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,961
'Yook'?

93
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,147
Yook-Gyo.
(A bridge or an overpass.)

94
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,900
A bridge.

95
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,723
Could it be that bridge over there?

96
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:03,448
- A bridge?
- I don't know. That does go down though.

97
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:09,174
- See? That would use up all the characters.
- Oh, you're right.

98
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:11,188
[The female students provide
a very likely answer.]

99
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:14,180
Maybe it really is the bridge.

100
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,866
- That's amazing.
- Look at this.

101
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,588
That's something that could be used
on top or on the bottom.

102
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,850
One of the 'o' and two of the 'k'.
That is it!

103
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,326
It's a bridge!

104
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:33,039
['Yook-Gyo' - Bridge.]

105
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,142
But do you know how many bridges
there are around here?

106
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,177
Yook... Yook-gyo!

107
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:43,350
[Even Big-nosed Brother solves the riddle
with the help of others.]

108
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:46,586
Where is there a bridge?
That one? That bridge?

109
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,282
I think I got it.
Thanks so much.

110
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,488
[A bridge is spotted near the university.]

111
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:59,719
[Mr. Capable heads over
to the closest bridge.]

112
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,678
What are you doing?
Isn't that Dong Hwan?

113
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,365
[Shaman Dong Hwan.]

114
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,521
- Long time no see, Dong Hwan.
- You made it. Have a seat.

115
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,432
[PD Dong Hwan makes a long awaited return
as the mysterious shaman.]

116
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,430
Seeing how eager you're looking...
you must want to live again?

117
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,384
- Yes, I want to live.
- Come closer.

118
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,593
You must go back to the past.

119
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,884
You want me to go back to the past?

120
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:24,950
Here.

121
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,782
<i>If you want to go back to the past to
reclaim your name tag and come back to life</i>

122
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,986
<i>you must go to the 'S' cancer hospital
in Sinchon and find the magical pill.</i>

123
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,282
[Magical pill...]

124
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,014
Okay, I understand.

125
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,790
- Am I the first one to have come here?
- That's a secret.

126
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,021
['S' Hospital in Sinchon.]

127
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:58,938
[Time travel... back to the past?]

128
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:03,902
Seeing the expression on your face, it looks
as though you want to come back to life?

129
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,159
Yes, I do.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,538
In that case,
I'll tell you how you can do that.

131
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,948
How would I do that?

132
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,644
You must go back to the past.

133
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,704
[This wasn't how it was supposed to go...]
What do you mean, go back to the past?

134
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:19,711
Here.

135
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,803
What do you mean, go back to the past?

136
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:25,560
Huh?
Where's the magical pill?

137
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,473
Go to that hospital over there,
and you can find your magical pill.

138
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,800
- Yes, I understand. But tell me honestly...
- Take the pill and go back to the past.

139
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,297
- How many others came before me?
- That's a secret.

140
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,500
I can tell by seeing how many
mission cards you have left.

141
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,367
- I can find out for myself.
- Go and find out for yourself.

142
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:42,140
You know what I feel whenever I see you
doing something like this?

143
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,017
I haven't been on the show in a while.
Please listen and just do as I say.

144
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,276
Okay, I understand.
Okay, then I'll be on my way.

145
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,694
- Then...
- Fighting.

146
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:51,193
Is there a hint or a clue that
you can share with me?

147
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:52,492
[Instead of being on his way,
he's requesting for another hint.]

148
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,120
Oh, this must be the place.

149
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:15,150
[This scene... looks all too familiar...]

150
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,221
Wait a minute.
Isn't this from the Yoo-ames Bond episode?

151
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:20,528
[Hospital, white hospital gowns,
and all these people...]

152
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:26,395
[Could this be...
the first Yoo-ames Bond episode?]

153
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,912
- What do you mean, Yoo-ames Bond episode?
- It's the Yoo-ames Bond episode.

154
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:32,810
What are you talking about?
What makes you even think that?

155
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:35,140
[Starting to bicker
as soon as they see each other.]

156
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,840
- Don't you remember this scene?
- Yes, of course I remember.

157
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,810
How did you figure out the riddle?

158
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,053
- That was no big deal.
- What a joke!

159
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:44,828
Seriously... even a six year old
could've figured it out.

160
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,509
- What did you say?
- Seriously.

161
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,156
I'll see you once I find
and take my magical pill.

162
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,578
[Their six year old level
conversation comes to a close.]

163
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,706
Ugh, Kim Jong Kook.
He beat me here.

164
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,936
[Must find the magical pill before he does.]

165
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:01,176
It's not like they have name tags on them.
But some of them are carrying a bag?

166
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,122
Excuse me.

167
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,624
Excuse me, but can I take a look at
what's inside that bag?

168
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,619
Why are you avoiding me?
Wait a minute.

169
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,871
[The way she's avoiding him
definitely makes her seem suspicious.]

170
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:16,093
Wait, I need to look at what's inside the bag.
Please show me what you have in there.

171
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:18,075
[Kkuk finally manages to stop her.]

172
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,728
- Show me what you have in there. Please?
- It's my gift to you.

173
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,740
Thank you.

174
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,033
What's in here?
It's just a case?

175
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,743
[The pill that he's searching for
isn't in the case.]

176
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,708
I think it's in one of the cases
that they're carrying around.

177
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:39,037
[All of the members enter the hospital
one by one after having solved the riddle.]

178
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,275
I wonder if the pill
is in one of those cases?

179
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:48,181
[Jae Suk also suspects the case.]

180
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,094
Excuse me.

181
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:56,631
[Chasing them down to check
the contents inside the case.]

182
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:02,648
[Oh? A medicine bottle?]

183
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:09,701
[If it's a medicine bottle,
then could the pill be inside the bottle?]

184
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,827
Stop him!

185
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:15,586
[Giraffe chases down his prey
to the end of the hallway.]

186
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,298
It's the pill, isn't it?

187
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,162
- Wrestling for it won't do any good.
- Yes, you're right.

188
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,559
Let's play for it.
Rock, paper, scissors.

189
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:39,004
[Huh? A nail?]

190
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,091
- Will it work if I were to eat this?
- You can't eat that.

191
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,410
I said, you can't eat that.

192
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,915
You can't eat that, Kwang Soo.

193
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,961
- What word game are you playing right now?
- You can't eat it. (But also, 'Eat the nail')

194
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,951
The nail... eat it.
(A word play on the word, nail.)

195
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:53,696
- What?
- You can't eat it, or eat the nail.

196
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,141
- What are you saying?
- You either can't eat it, or eat the nail.

197
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,732
- Eat the nail.
- You can't eat it, or eat the nail.

198
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,878
You really are a master of words.

199
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,558
[We'll say that you will not be
eating the nail then...]

200
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,680
- There's Gary.
- I couldn't find the bridge right away.

201
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,481
So you solved the riddle,
but you couldn't find the bridge?

202
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,545
No, I wasn't able to solve the riddle.

203
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,517
- Wait.
- Why?

204
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:23,154
[Something... is about to change.]

205
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,831
<i>- What did you just do?
- I didn't do anything!</i>

206
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:36,562
[One by one... the members suddenly
start to disappear.]

207
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:41,269
I'm seriously about to go crazy.

208
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,701
[Just what is happening to
these members?]

209
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:54,142
[Time is starting to flow backwards.]

210
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:58,303
<i>If you were given the chance to travel
back in time on Running Man...</i>

211
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:02,128
<i>Then which point in time
would you like to go back to?</i>

212
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,377
[The time that Blank Ji would like to
go back to is?]

213
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:06,868
In my history of Running Man...

214
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:10,376
the most fun I ever had was...

215
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:17,475
The psychic power episode was one episode
that I will never be able to forget.

216
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,768
It's the Yoo-ames Bond episode.

217
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,748
- Which of those episodes?
- Excuse me?

218
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,786
All those Yoo-ames Bond episodes
were a masterpiece.

219
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,367
<i>I felt so good in those episodes.</i>

220
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:31,108
[Yoo-ames Bond showed a beautiful twist
to a story with a simple water gun.]

221
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,558
I almost had Jae Suk in that episode.

222
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:40,446
But unfortunately, right at the end...
I even had everything opened up too.

223
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:45,978
[If he could've starred in any episode?]
The Yoo-ames Bond episode with the water gun.

224
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:55,997
[Time travel... back into the past.]

225
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,627
[Wait...]

226
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:07,239
[This place is...]

227
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,719
What the heck is this?

228
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,321
Why are we starting off like this?

229
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,831
We're doing this again?
Seriously!

230
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,054
Where are my roasted dumplings?

231
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,883
[Someone took the magical pill.]

232
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:28,000
[And...]

233
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:37,843
[They're all locked up behind bars again
just like the last time.]

234
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,030
We have to find it again?
The secret number code?

235
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,903
Wait, this is...

236
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,700
This is... Yoo-ames...

237
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,924
[April 22, 2012.]

238
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:01,647
[Their race for the day starts off
behind locked bars.]

239
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,992
[Their moments of disparate running
in order to escape their prison.]

240
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:15,068
[They all became ousted by
Yoo-ames Bond's water gun.]

241
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,581
[The Yoo-ames Bond episode that threw
everyone into a state of panic.]

242
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,035
So Jae Suk ousted everyone?

243
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:31,103
[The events that transpired during that
episode are still clear in their memories.]

244
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:36,957
[Yoo-ames Bond walks away in ease
after having ousted all the members.]

245
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,089
What's going on here?

246
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,562
Even the clothes?
Then is there a water gun?

247
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,639
Why are we doing this all of a sudden?

248
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,187
Are you out of your mind or something?

249
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,648
But... we've already done this
so they already know what happens.

250
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,613
So you're asking me to go around
with the water gun again?

251
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:05,121
[Is it the return of Yoo-ames Bond?]

252
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,669
We had to find our way out of here
and find the key.

253
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:15,319
There were so many
security guards back then.

254
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:23,819
[Just like the last time, security guards
are seen guarding the premises.]

255
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,131
It's the sequel?

256
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:29,004
It was like the Yoo-ames Bond
sequel episode.

257
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,382
We had to find the hidden clues
to escape out of here.

258
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,173
I have to find the hidden number code.

259
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:40,426
[And there's one person who's more confused
than anyone else at that exact moment.]

260
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:43,138
- We've gone back to that night.
- We have?

261
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,536
[First time travel-
It's currently April 22, 2012.]

262
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,352
What are you trying to do
right now?

263
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:52,441
[How will Yoo-ames Bond's second experience
with the events of April 22nd turn out?]

264
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,672
Seriously, I'm going to lose my mind.

265
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:58,136
[First thing he must do is to solve the code,
and escape from behind bars.]

266
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:03,144
[Oh?]

267
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:10,899
[His padlock... is unlocked?]

268
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,251
Huh?

269
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:15,895
Wait, what is this?

270
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,900
It's unlocked.

271
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,070
[The events of the past are different.
Could it be the effects of time travel?]

272
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:24,468
What is this?

273
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:29,270
<i>Find the layout of the building,
and escape within the next hour.</i>

274
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,556
Isn't this what happened the
last time too?

275
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,668
Do I have a name tag on my back or not?

276
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:43,418
[The name tag that didn't exist in the past
is now on his back.]

277
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,434
What in the world?

278
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,346
What in the world is going on here?

279
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,775
[Carefully steps out from his jail cell...]

280
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,749
[Yoo-ames Bond...]

281
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,917
[Has his day returned once again?]

282
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,572
Where am I supposed to find
the layout of this building?

283
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:10,608
[Jae Suk searches for the blueprints
of the building as the note has instructed.]

284
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,818
I need to get out here within
the next hour.

285
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,426
<i>Get him!</i>

286
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:20,224
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

287
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,246
Wait.

288
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,108
I just got out here.

289
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,617
[Dragged back to the cell
if captured by the security guards.]

290
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,295
Why are you putting me back
in there already?

291
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,775
Did he get caught?
Hey!

292
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,579
It isn't you?
What's happening to you?

293
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,211
- I have no idea.
- Did you run into anyone?

294
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:46,700
- I think this is the Yoo-ames Bond episode.
- This is the Yoo-ames Bond episode.

295
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:49,319
Suk Jin!
This is Yoo-ames Bond sequel episode.

296
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,691
Yeah, this is the sequel.
You remember what happened, right?

297
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,194
- Suk Jin.
- You haven't made it out yet?

298
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,034
- How did you get out?
- You haven't made it out then?

299
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,857
But I remember...

300
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,701
[The padlock is already unlocked...]

301
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,853
- Did you take the pill or not?
- No, I didn't take it.

302
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,377
- Suk Jin, how did you get out?
- Huh?

303
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,727
Yeah, the padlock was already unlocked.

304
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:10,877
Why didn't you tell me about this?

305
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,637
- Seriously.
- Why would I have to tell you?

306
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:18,597
[Easy Brothers' loyalty always has
been a pretty thin line.]

307
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:19,957
Watch your back.

308
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,243
- Watch your back.
- Get him!

309
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:26,702
[Discovered by the security guards
the moment he escapes from his cell.]

310
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,563
I was actually in here.
I didn't step foot outside my cell.

311
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:31,151
He's the one who was out walking around.
I never left my cell.

312
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,221
I need to find the blueprint.

313
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,143
[Kkuk is on the search for the blueprint
after having escaped his cell.]

314
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,367
I have to find the blueprint.

315
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,667
Which floor am I on right now?

316
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,280
[The security guards.]

317
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,279
[He'll be dragged back to his cell
once he's captured.]

318
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,994
[The open jail cell is already filling up
with prisoners.]

319
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:12,807
- You were the culprit the last time, right?
- Not the culprit, but the star of the show.

320
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,990
I still can't forget
the sound of your whistling to this day.

321
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,879
Ugh, you're right.

322
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,089
I'm starting to remember everything.

323
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:27,921
[Yoo-ames Bond-
His betrayal that they're not able to forget.]

324
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:30,880
Even though you can tie up my body,
you can't tie up my freedom.

325
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:34,991
[Gary's infamous line.]

326
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:37,624
The blueprint is nowhere to be found.
So what are we doing in here?

327
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,076
Why?
But that's not your goal, is it?

328
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:43,712
But I don't have a water gun.
You think I'd be here if I had it?

329
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:45,495
I'm sure you'll be
getting one soon though, right?

330
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,249
- Or he'll drink his pill.
- I told you that I'm not.

331
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,804
- I don't even know what the pill is.
- I don't either.

332
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:53,200
- What is that?
- I don't know either. I haven't even seen it.

333
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,631
[Is that right?]
What did you have, Gary?

334
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,353
I... had a caramel macchiato earlier.

335
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,716
- No, you were talking about some pill.
- Did you take the pill?

336
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:05,086
No, I don't know what you're
talking about.

337
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,235
- Did you take it or not?
- Didn't you meet Shaman Dong Hwan?

338
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,442
Dong Hwan told us to take the pill.

339
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:12,306
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I saw Dong Hwan.

340
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,480
- But you didn't solve your mission earlier.
- You didn't solve the riddle?

341
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,810
- You couldn't solve it?
- You didn't solve the mission?

342
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,599
- Seriously.
- You couldn't even solve a simple problem?

343
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,672
- You went to the bridge?
- Of course I did.

344
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,996
- Did you take the pill?
- No, I didn't.

345
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,793
- Then you're the only one who took it?
- No, I didn't take it either.

346
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:29,776
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!

347
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:32,344
- You just said you solved the mission!
- Give it to me and I'll take it right now.

348
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:34,331
[They're becoming more and more
suspicious of each other.]

349
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,692
- You're the most suspicious one here.
- Why me?

350
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:39,010
It makes no sense that you made it here when
you didn't even solve the riddle.

351
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,534
How did you even make it here
without having solved that?

352
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:43,074
Can a student even get into a university
without having passed the exam?

353
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,949
Yes, all the time!

354
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,732
Oh, all the time?
In the variety world?

355
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,641
[No matter what the case...]

356
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:55,716
[These two are acting a bit suspicious.]

357
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,149
Just where in the world is it?

358
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:07,164
[Yoo-ames Bond was the star
of this episode...]

359
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:10,077
[Is the blueprint what he's
searching for right now?]

360
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,131
[Or could it be the water gun?]

361
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,183
It's nothing.

362
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,385
Wow, I thought that was it.

363
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:25,403
[What is it that Gary is searching for?]

364
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,501
[That's...]

365
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:41,921
[Blank Ji discovers the blueprint!]

366
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:43,559
Awesome.

367
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,192
Awesome.

368
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:52,803
[If the memory serves right, then the location
of the key is indicated on the blueprint!]

369
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,255
It's on the second floor.

370
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:56,913
Department of Nuclear Medicine.

371
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,172
[Just like the last time...]

372
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:04,357
[Must find the key to escape from these
suspiciously similar events to the past.]

373
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,392
[Just then, Kkuk and Haroro meet up.]

374
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:12,687
Jong Kook.

375
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:15,675
Gary...

376
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:18,353
- Gary... it's Gary.
- What are you doing?

377
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,185
Why?
Tell me your reasoning for it.

378
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:21,947
- Earlier...
- Yeah?

379
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:24,287
- Earlier...
- You're not trying to lure me in, are you?

380
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:25,747
No, not at all.

381
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:30,133
Listen... Jae Suk, Gary and I were
help captive together a little bit ago.

382
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:33,373
Without there being a reason to,
Gary started asking me weird questions.

383
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:36,174
He started talking about some pill.

384
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:38,189
So I asked him what the pill was.

385
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,109
Then Jae Suk started covering up for Gary
instead of questioning him with me.

386
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,499
- What was he trying to do?
- I kept thinking about it...

387
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,794
- I'm sure that Jae Suk is up to something.
- I've been thinking about it...

388
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,266
I want some water.

389
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,611
[Oh?]

390
00:23:57,612 --> 00:24:00,293
[That is...]

391
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:06,061
[A water gun?]

392
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,471
I don't think an opportunity like this
is ever going to come around again.

393
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,639
What are you doing!

394
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:14,721
[Mr. Capable attacks!]

395
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:25,377
[How can this be!]

396
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,696
You actually brought me
into the room with you.

397
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:30,919
[But why is he...]

398
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,681
[Panic]

399
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:41,401
[What could have happened
to Jong Kook?]

400
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:47,089
[May 18, 2014- Present day.]

401
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:52,511
[The members went on a search for
the pill during the current day and time.]

402
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:57,082
This is the type of place
where the pill is usually found.

403
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,209
See?
This is where the pills are usually found.

404
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,832
These are the type of places where
the pills are found in the movies... Oh!

405
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:12,258
[Mr. Capable discovers the magical pill!]

406
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:21,448
[Just what is the hidden power behind
the mysterious magical pill?]

407
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:26,112
April 22, 2012.

408
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:28,708
This is way past the expiration date.

409
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,452
Is it okay for me to be taking this?

410
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,085
If I take this...

411
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:37,010
are we going to go back to
April 22, 2012?

412
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,294
Should I take it?

413
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:44,892
[Cautiously takes the pill
with trepidation.]

414
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:07,989
Once I took the pill,
we went back to April 22, 2012.

415
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:14,310
[Nurse Dong Hwan comes to
visit Kkuk in his cell.]

416
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:17,533
- What is all that?
- Follow me.

417
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,460
What?
You want me to follow you?

418
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:29,242
[An empty room.]

419
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,528
What is this?

420
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:42,526
[Opens up the closet in the room.]

421
00:26:44,032 --> 00:26:45,934
There's a door?

422
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:56,538
[Just like the door that Yoo-ames Bond
discovered back on April 22, 2012...]

423
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,808
There's a door?

424
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:09,536
[Then behind that door...]

425
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,646
Wait, wait a minute.
What is this?

426
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,185
Then am I...

427
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,050
Could it be because I took the pill?

428
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:21,630
[It's the same room where Yoo-ames Bond
received his secret mission!]

429
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,370
So this is what Yoo Jae Suk must've felt.

430
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:26,870
So this is how Jae Suk must've felt like.

431
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:28,894
What is this?

432
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:32,162
- You know what this is about, right?
- Yes, I think I know.

433
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:36,382
Mr. Kim Jong Kook.
You took the magical pill.

434
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:41,581
Today is April 22, 2012.

435
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:45,638
You have come back as Yoo-ames Bond
in the Return of Yoo-ames Bond segment.

436
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,634
But... this is...

437
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:01,807
[The history of Running Man
is about to change.]

438
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,524
[Running Man Time Travel-
Return of Yoo-ames Bond.]

439
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,166
<i>Today is April 22, 2012.</i>

440
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,731
<i>[You are the star of
The Return of Yoo-ames Bond Race.]</i>

441
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:12,099
[The new star of The Return of
Yoo-ames Bond.]

442
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:15,590
Oust all the members of Running Man by
shooting them with the water gun to win.

443
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:19,262
[The new star of The Return of Yoo-ames
Bond- Kim Jong Kook.]

444
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:25,213
Wow, this is really amazing.
Then behind that wall is...

445
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:27,632
It's just as you've seen in the
past episode.

446
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:35,047
[Just like that moment from the past...]

447
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:40,198
[The spinning wall...]

448
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:46,422
[Behind that wall is...
various water guns.]

449
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,992
[Extremely happy]

450
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,467
[Selects the turtle water gun
which he can hide in his hand.]

451
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,136
I can hide it in my hand like this.
I think this will be perfect.

452
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,307
- For Kkuk-ames Bond...
- Yes?

453
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:01,863
Yes, I'm Kkuk-ames Bond.

454
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:06,221
You must recapture all the members
before they escape from the building

455
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:08,237
in order for you to win this race.

456
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:11,545
[Recapture all the members before
they escape to win the race!]

457
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:16,283
If even one member succeeds at escaping,
then this time travel will come to an end.

458
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:17,667
Is that right?

459
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,493
[Kkuk-ames Bond completes his preparation
to start his secret mission.]

460
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:30,406
[You just wait, Yoo-ames Bond...
Kkuk-ames Bond is now here.]

461
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:32,216
I will oust every one of them.

462
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,475
Especially... Mr. Yoo Jae Suk.

463
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,837
I want him to experience what
this feels like.

464
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,184
[Welcome to Kkuk-ames Bond's world.]

465
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:51,884
I don't think an opportunity like this
is ever going to come knocking again.

466
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:54,221
[Ha Ha unknowingly gave Kkuk-ames Bond
an easy way to oust him.]

467
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,014
What is this?

468
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:57,795
[Time for some action.]

469
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:04,795
[Kkuk-ames Bond's first shot-
A bulls-eye!]

470
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:11,179
[This has to be a dream.]

471
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:15,165
I thought it was going to be difficult to get
someone in a room, but you brought me in here.

472
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,167
[The water gun...
so this is what it feels like.]

473
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:21,169
You're guesses were way off.

474
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,427
[Extremely confused.]

475
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,829
Sorry, Dong Hoon.

476
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,954
[Sorry, my brother.
But I'm the star of this race.]

477
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:44,487
[Ha Ha is recaptured.]

478
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,808
I must've been crazy.

479
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:55,636
[Kkuk-ames Bond runs off to another floor
to avoid any suspicion.]

480
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,899
Hey!

481
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,251
Ji Hyo!

482
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,303
- Huh?
- Dong Hoon!

483
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:08,752
Where is he?

484
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:12,334
[Kkuk-ames Bond purposely shows Ha Ha's
recapturing to avoid any suspicion.]

485
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:15,228
Why is he being taken away?

486
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:17,351
He's being silenced
as they're taking him away.

487
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,863
[Just then!]

488
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:22,765
[Blank Ji starts to do
a body search on Kkuk-ames Bond!]

489
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,959
- Come on, seriously?
- You don't have anything?

490
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,843
[It'll all be over for him if she
discovers his water gun!]

491
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:36,679
No, I don't have anything!

492
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:40,985
[Where did he hide his water gun?]

493
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,665
I didn't think so.
I don't have anything either.

494
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:48,080
I really don't have anything, Jong Kook.
I only have my cellphone and a mirror.

495
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:52,869
You're acting strange.

496
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,765
[He's pretending to be
suspicious of Blank Ji.]

497
00:31:56,953 --> 00:31:58,625
Why would Ha Ha get recaptured?

498
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,207
But Jae Suk told me that
Ha Ha was being most suspicious.

499
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:04,461
[Kkuk-ames Bond is casually avoiding
any of Blank Ji's suspicion.]

500
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:07,094
- Then could Jae Suk be something?
- He said Ha Ha was most suspicious.

501
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:15,818
<i>Ha Ha is recaptured.</i>

502
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,946
Then that means he's been shot
by the water gun.

503
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:22,009
[All the members are thrown into a fit of
anxiety upon the news of Ha Ha's recapturing.]

504
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:25,595
Why did he get recaptured?

505
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,124
Then someone must've ousted him.

506
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,320
Then someone must have a water gun.

507
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,394
This won't do.
I shouldn't be sitting here like this.

508
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:37,454
I have to escape out of here.
I'm not the star of this race.

509
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,456
[The original Yoo-ames Bond
lost his spotlight to someone else.]

510
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,514
Who is it?
Who's my imposter?

511
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:46,120
The original star is right here,
so who's going around...

512
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:50,387
I need to go catch my imposter.
Who's going around pretending to be me?

513
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:53,783
Jong Kook!

514
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:57,199
[Did Kwang Soo catch on to the plan?]

515
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,900
[No, of course not.]

516
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:03,532
[In anything else, the next victim is alerting
the culprit to what has just transpired.]

517
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,674
So this means that there's definitely
a Yoo-ames Bond amongst us today.

518
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:09,826
- So that means...
- If it's a water gun...

519
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,025
- But this game is all about the water gun.
- But I searched for it, and didn't find any.

520
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,349
Be careful.

521
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,822
There are too many guards walking around.

522
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,175
Let's find the blueprint first.
We must hurry.

523
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:25,467
[Convincing Kwang Soo to find
the blueprint first in order to escape.]

524
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:31,083
Since the blueprint indicated where
the key is located...

525
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:34,001
- I'll be in the next room.
- Okay.

526
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:37,004
[Kwang Soo walks away
to search the next room.]

527
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:44,604
[The real reason why
Kkuk-ames Bond came here is...]

528
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,085
[It was to retrieve his water gun!]

529
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:50,978
[Having hid the water gun elsewhere in case
of someone doing a body search on him.]

530
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:53,590
[Shall we get back in the game?]

531
00:33:57,726 --> 00:33:59,886
- Ji Hyo, have you seen anyone?
- Jong Kook.

532
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,980
- Why isn't anyone even around?
- Jong Kook.

533
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:05,305
Do you remember why Ha Ha has been
recaptured from the past episode?

534
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:09,316
Kwang Soo just told me that he saw
a water gun mark on his back.

535
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:11,332
- When you get shot by the water gun...
- Get them!

536
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,416
You'll be recaptured if you get
shot by the water gun.

537
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,416
[The two tries to flee together as they're
spotted by the security guards.]

538
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,050
- When?
- Don't you remember?

539
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,856
[Just then!]

540
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,316
[He drops... the water gun on the floor!]

541
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:32,805
[But fortunately for him, she's
too busy hiding to see the water gun.]

542
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:40,615
[But just then...
Kwang Soo comes up from behind!]

543
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:47,345
[Kkuk-ames Bond picks up the water gun
in a blink of an eye!]

544
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,349
[The idiot!
Kwang Soo didn't see it!]

545
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:56,169
[An extremely dangerous situation
that could've ruined everything!]

546
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,236
[Kkuk-ames Bond shaves ten years
off of his life!]

547
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,169
What do you have under your shirt?

548
00:35:05,142 --> 00:35:07,967
[Kwang Soo found the blueprint.]

549
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:10,336
Let's see that.

550
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:13,141
[This isn't good...]

551
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,155
Wow, this is exhausting.

552
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,605
So it's not on the second floor.

553
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:25,292
- Third floor?
- What about the fourth floor?

554
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:31,253
[I think it's time... for you to go.]

555
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,544
[Time to hunt down the Giraffe.]

556
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,397
I think it's on the fourth floor.

557
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:56,778
What?

558
00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,735
- What?
- What did you just do?

559
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:02,919
No, nothing.
Come on, Kwang Soo. Second floor?

560
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,989
Where did you find this?

561
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,703
- Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

562
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:13,667
It's really a relief...
because I really needed this blueprint.

563
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:17,326
Okay, then I'll let others believe
that I found this myself.

564
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:20,785
I don't think they'll suspect me as long as
I let them think that I'm working really hard.

565
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:23,700
Why are you such an awful person?
Did you just oust me?

566
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,495
[Kkuk-ames Bond is proving to be even more
of a nightmare than Yoo-ames Bond.]

567
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,242
<i>Target, Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

568
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,471
[Let go of me!]

569
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:33,701
[Giraffe is lashing out
from his sense betrayal.]

570
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:36,171
- Sorry, Kwang Soo.
- Hey!

571
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,421
Did you just say, 'Hey'?

572
00:36:40,263 --> 00:36:42,326
[Lee Kwang Soo is recaptured.]

573
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:51,005
<i>Lee Kwang Soo has been recaptured.
Lee Kwang Soo has been recaptured.</i>

574
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,765
<i>So the key is on the fourth floor.</i>

575
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:59,413
[Gary is feeling the pressure to find the key
and make his escape.]

576
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,501
This is it.

577
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:10,209
[Carefully searching through
the entire room.]

578
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:13,508
No way they would've hidden it here.

579
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:22,634
[Curiosity... killed the cat.]

580
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:23,917
They actually hid it in there?

581
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:26,744
[Gary finds the key!]

582
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,015
[Now he just has to find the exit...]

583
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,968
So Gary hasn't been caught.

584
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:47,821
[Just then... Jong Kook uses the blueprint
as bait to approach Jae Suk.]

585
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:52,313
- Where did you find it?
- On the third floor.

586
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,670
- What did you find?
- The key is on the fourth floor.

587
00:37:56,998 --> 00:38:00,845
[Kkuk-ames Bond tries to avoid any suspicion
by sharing his information with Jae Suk.]

588
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:09,756
[The new star, Kkuk-ames Bond...
faces off with the original Yoo-ames Bond.]

589
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:14,117
You don't have a water gun, do you?

590
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,053
[The original isn't proving to be
a very easy opponent...]

591
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:20,852
[And the formidable new player
on the scene.]

592
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:26,299
[The water gun is hidden in his waistline...]

593
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:36,830
[The undeniable nervous energy...
and these two formidable opponents.]

594
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,122
- So the key is on the fourth floor?
- Let's go up to the fourth floor.

595
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,894
[Leaving the room with wariness
towards one another.]

596
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:47,127
- Let's go up there separately.
- Why?

597
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,070
I think it would be better for us
to go up there separately.

598
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,786
I just shared a very crucial
bit of information with you.

599
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:56,092
- This isn't an individual victory.
- I know.

600
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:58,944
- This is a group victory.
- Yes, you're right.

601
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,903
Wake up, and throw away your greed.

602
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,358
I'm not being greedy right now,
but I think that you're dangerous.

603
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,144
How can I even oust you
without a water gun?

604
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:08,610
You're good at spouting off water
at times, aren't you?

605
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,947
You can't think that I have some watercolor
swishing around in my mouth?

606
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:14,886
What if you're up to something?

607
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:17,214
I'm sure there's a solution to this.

608
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,696
- Are you sure that it isn't you?
- No, it's not me.

609
00:39:19,697 --> 00:39:22,731
- Why isn't it you?
- I was just with Ji Hyo and Suk Jin.

610
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,189
[You're saying that the three of you
were just together?]

611
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:31,592
[So that's why you're being
suspicious of me?]

612
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,988
I'm just going to back away right now.

613
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,231
- You're a little suspicious.
- Okay, fine.

614
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:40,813
[I need to find another way.]

615
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,198
What could it be?

616
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,316
Is it not him?

617
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,762
Just what in the world is going on today?

618
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:51,050
[Kkuk-ames Bond's ambush attack!]

619
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:55,360
[If words aren't going to do it...
then I have no other choice but to attack!]

620
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:05,242
[April 22, 2012...
the moment of ultimate insult!]

621
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:08,754
[I will rewrite the history of that moment!]

622
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,685
[Bulls-eye!]

623
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:19,705
[Original Yoo-ames Bond is defeated
by the new Kkuk-ames Bond!]

624
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:28,422
[The one who used to wield
the water gun...]

625
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:31,742
[is thrown back in time to become
the victim of the water gun himself.]

626
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:39,480
[Goodbye, Yoo-ames.]

627
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:45,658
<i>That is not the way
the water gun is supposed to be used.</i>

628
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,536
- How did he get you?
- What are you going to do now?

629
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:49,971
How could you have ruined the
Yoo-ames Bond episode like this?

630
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,582
You know how the right way to do it
is to do it secretly?

631
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,875
He just attacked me with the water gun
pointed at my face like this.

632
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:58,926
[Frontal attack is Kkuk-ames Bond's style.]

633
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:02,800
- That's what he did to me too.
- This is not how it's supposed to be done!

634
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,444
I know that everyone has
their own style.

635
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:07,044
What are you going to do about all the viewers
who love the Yoo-ames Bond episodes?

636
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:10,880
The way he's doing it is the
Terminator style!

637
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:13,158
What's even the point of him
using a water gun in this case?

638
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,326
Seriously.

639
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:18,475
[Kkuk-ames Bond's water gun is starting to
close in on the remaining members.]

640
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,165
[Blank Ji is busy searching for the exit.]

641
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,946
So I need to find the exit
out of this building.

642
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,740
[Big-nose Brother has been recaptured
without anyone even knowing!]

643
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,095
It's Jong Kook.

644
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:55,666
[Since it's already come to this...
I'll now just do it my way.]

645
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:02,918
[Kkuk-minator]

646
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:14,521
[Compared to Yoo-ames' annoying whistles,
Kkuk-ames' whistles are downright terrifying.]

647
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:28,942
It's been Kim Jong Kook all along.

648
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:34,399
[A terrifying sight to behold.]

649
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,878
- Where in the world is Kang Gary right now?
- Guys, where are you?

650
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:48,055
[Gary quickly hid himself in a hiding spot
as soon as he heard the whistling sound.]

651
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:49,691
Gary?

652
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:54,565
I'm really starting to miss you.

653
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,153
Gary?

654
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,499
No!

655
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,273
You're going to get me caught.

656
00:43:06,814 --> 00:43:08,582
Guys!

657
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,525
Guys, where are you?

658
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:15,603
[Barely manages to pull himself together
to move from his hiding spot.]

659
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:17,163
- You scared me!
- Did you see him?

660
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,814
- See what?
- Jong Kook is carrying around a water rifle.

661
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:22,183
- Jong Kook is the culprit.
- Really?

662
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:25,603
- Who was the one whistling?
- How far have you searched for the exit?

663
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,420
I have the key right here.

664
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:31,424
[Gary has become as blank minded
as he was back in 2012.]

665
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:33,204
I found the keys.

666
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,718
How many are there?

667
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,579
[Monday Couple are the last ones left alive,
and they each pull out their set of keys.]

668
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,280
Have you found the way out yet?
The exit door?

669
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:42,704
[They just need to find the exit.]

670
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,835
- Over there?
- Come here.

671
00:43:46,138 --> 00:43:48,298
- I was thinking that it was over there too.
- See how it's wider over there?

672
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:51,596
Remember how we used to race around
the skywalk a lot back in the day?

673
00:43:56,195 --> 00:44:00,084
[Just as they're predicting,
the exit is at the end of the skywalk!]

674
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,803
- Let's go right now.
- Even if we don't run into him...

675
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:03,599
Why?
Is it not opening?

676
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,173
[If one of the keys are the right one,
then they can make their escape right now!]

677
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:12,491
Guys, where are you?
Come out while I'm still being nice.

678
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:13,615
[Just then, Kkuk-ames Bond starts to
head over in their direction!]

679
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,703
Let's go.
Let's go quickly!

680
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,119
[Now that everything is out in the open,
speed is the key to their survival!]

681
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,869
We don't have much time!

682
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:26,667
Where could you guys have gone?

683
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:33,775
[Oh?
He catches the Monday Couple running away.]

684
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:36,027
We don't have much time!

685
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,139
Here it is!
Try the keys quickly!

686
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,400
[Gary and Blank Ji arrive at
the exit door.]

687
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:46,465
[Only one out of these is the right one.]

688
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:51,631
[He's coming!]

689
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:58,875
[Please...]

690
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:02,791
[Quickly!]

691
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,355
[Will they escape first...]

692
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:09,931
[Or get caught?]

693
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:18,757
[It opened!]

694
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:23,073
[Gary and Blank Ji succeed
at making their escape!]

695
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,604
<i>What the heck!
It's over?</i>

696
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:32,058
[May 18, 2014- Present Day.]

697
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,565
Who do you think it is?
I'm going to get Kim Jong Kook for this.

698
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:39,394
[Hi!]

699
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:43,731
- I can't even stand the sight of him.
- You've just totally ruined Yoo-ames Bond.

700
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:46,574
What are you supposed to be?
Rambo?

701
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:49,910
I was going to do it shirtless,
and I barely held myself back.

702
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,210
The beauty of Yoo-ames Bond is
doing it covertly.

703
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:55,349
What do you mean, that's the beauty of it?
You should just be upfront with it.

704
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,405
- You just totally ruined Yoo-ames Bond.
- Just shoot everyone down.

705
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:04,428
- Just shoot them all down!
- Seriously.

706
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,165
I'm going to make myself very clear
about this right now.

707
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,029
But my Yoo-ames Bond series
is a totally different thing from him.

708
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:12,127
[The Senior Bond isn't acknowledging
the validity of the Junior Bond.]

709
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,510
- He's totally different.
- Yoo Jae Suk, can you step forward?

710
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:15,899
Why?

711
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,137
- What's that?
- What is that?

712
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:19,749
What is it now?
Why is it bigger?

713
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:22,677
Seriously!
What the heck is this!

714
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:27,117
[The name tags of those who were eliminated
during the time travel are enlarged.]

715
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,374
So only those who succeeded keep
the smaller name tags.

716
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,258
I didn't know that this was
going to happen.

717
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:33,863
- You too, Mr. Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes, Kook-Bo.

718
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:37,543
[Kkuk-ames Bond unfortunately also gets
a name tag enlargement.]

719
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,608
You two will keep your current size.

720
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:42,693
These two always win together
whenever we do something like this.

721
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:46,001
I allowed her to step out of
the exit first.

722
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:49,774
- I'm just telling him what happened.
- You'd better pull yourself together.

723
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:51,757
<i>You must find the next pill.</i>

724
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:56,439
Kim Jong Kook can never become Yoo-ames
Bond in a Yoo-ames Bond episode.

725
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,633
He needs to play the evil character.

726
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:01,402
No, the evil character suits him better.

727
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:03,554
That way, the star can shine even brighter.

728
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,976
That's why Kim Jong Kook should
never play Bond.

729
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:07,832
He needs to play the evil character.

730
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,667
I would...

731
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:17,621
like to go back to
the Sherlock Holmes episode.

732
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,825
I don't think anyone other than
myself can do that one.

733
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:23,029
I'm the only one who can do it.
Why, you ask?

734
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,870
Because to be perfectly blunt,
the episode was written specifically for me.

735
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,755
If I was Lupin,
I wouldn't have done it that way.

736
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:40,881
[Kwang Soo takes the pill?]

737
00:47:44,055 --> 00:47:45,763
What is it now?

738
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:49,233
Who took the pill this time?

739
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:57,084
[What happened to Running Man members
on January 29, 2012?]

740
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,362
I should've found the pill again.

741
00:48:09,274 --> 00:48:14,485
[The start of another time travel.]

742
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:17,039
Is it the Lupin episode?

743
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:25,614
Ah, that Lupin?
The battle between Lupin and Holmes?

744
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:32,393
[That's right... it was a
battle between Holmes and Lupin.]

745
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:33,922
Wait, this is...

746
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:35,560
Sherlock Holmes!

747
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,847
When Jae Dong and Dong Hyun came on
in the Busan episode...

748
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:43,384
Suk Jin had done it!

749
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:47,238
I remember Suk Jin taking me down.
I still can't believe that happened.

750
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:53,000
[The painful memory of having been
ousted by Suk Jin.]

751
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,509
Is it the Sherlock episode?
Is it?

752
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,013
My ultimate masterpiece, Sherlock?

753
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,375
[The first time he became the star...
His unforgettable role as Lupin.]

754
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:11,249
Yes, that was a great episode.
I captured Lupin at the end.

755
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,925
I remember the unbelievable clue
that I found in the book.

756
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:17,764
[Brilliantly figured out the true identity
of Lupin at the end!]

757
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:23,157
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo duo
thus captures Lupin Suk Jin!]

758
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:29,106
<i>A rare treasure by the name of 'Blue Water',
which is a giant sized sapphire is hidden</i>

759
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:33,982
<i>and clues to the treasure's location
are hidden throughout this building.</i>

760
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:40,553
[Find the clues to claim the sapphire
to win the mission!]

761
00:49:42,202 --> 00:49:45,032
This is a mission tailored just for me.

762
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:49,770
Rather than the treasure hunting mission,
it's all about Lupin having returned.

763
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:52,120
Just what Lupin is all about.

764
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:54,740
This is about Suk Jin, isn't it?

765
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,057
Just who took the pill this time?

766
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:00,494
<i>Right now...</i>

767
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:05,586
<i>it's January 29, 2012.</i>

768
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,868
[Time travel back to January 29, 2012.]

769
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:15,735
<i>You are the star of the
Sherlock Holmes Race.</i>

770
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:21,573
<i>You are the star of the
Sherlock Holmes Race.</i>

771
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:28,465
<i>You are Lupin, The Phantom Thief.</i>

772
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:33,094
[Lupin, The Phantom Thief- Kwang Soo.]

773
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:36,368
<i>Since you took the magical pill</i>

774
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,564
<i>you became the star of
the Sherlock Holmes Race.</i>

775
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:50,480
<i>You have to oust the other members of RM
while pretending to be ousted yourself to win.</i>

776
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,210
I understand,
and I will do my best.

777
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:56,171
<i>Due to the butterfly effect that took place
during the time travel back into the past</i>

778
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,470
<i>the mission for Lupin has
slightly changed.</i>

779
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,938
<i>You have to let others believe that
you've been ousted out of the race</i>

780
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:06,605
<i>you have to find the briefcases which
contain the name tags of the other members</i>

781
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:10,308
<i>and you have to oust those members by
ripping off those name tags.</i>

782
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:12,478
[Find the briefcases which contain the
name tags of the other members to oust them.]

783
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:14,814
So I don't have to rip it off
their backs directly?

784
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,724
That's not too bad.

785
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:25,270
[Time travel back into the past has changed
the role of Lupin.]

786
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:32,838
[Will he be able to change the outcome
of the race as well?]

787
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,461
<i>This is too hard.</i>

788
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,816
It's too hard to be doing this alone.

789
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:54,064
- Hi!
- Long time no see!

790
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:58,942
[Lupin's helpers- Team Hao and Chao.]

791
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,054
Thank you.
Yes, thank you!

792
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:04,750
Wow, it's been so long!

793
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,942
That's right, I had forgotten.

794
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,762
[Team Hao and Chao had lured and
confused the Sherlock  Holmes characters.]

795
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:14,268
I'm the new Lupin.

796
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:17,090
- You?
- Yes, I'm Lupin.

797
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:20,904
- We're ruined.
- Why are we ruined?

798
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:23,454
- No, we're not.
- I think we can do it.

799
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:26,320
- Thank you so much.
- Fighting.

800
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:27,468
[Lupin Kwang Soo with his team
of dependable helpers.]

801
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:31,500
One, two, three... Fighting!

802
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:36,421
[Celebrating as if
they've already won the race.]

803
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,258
- I won't disappoint you.
- We're ruined.

804
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:42,482
You have to remain quiet.

805
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:49,758
Seriously... I'm not good at finding things,
and I have to find things all day.

806
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:53,228
I'm not good at doing
detailed things like this.

807
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:55,364
What's all that noise?

808
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,496
What's that?
Where are you going?

809
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,715
- Where are you going?
- Huh?

810
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:07,226
[I'm in big trouble!]

811
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:11,596
[Caught in a difficult position
right from the start of the race.]

812
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,634
Isn't it the Hao Chao guys?
Where are you going?

813
00:53:14,635 --> 00:53:17,434
- Isn't it the Hao Chao guys?
- Yes.

814
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,144
[Caught walking together
with Hao Chao Team...]

815
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:23,624
Jae Suk.

816
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,594
Isn't it the Hao Chao guys?

817
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:34,280
[This would mean that he could suspect
my true identity...]

818
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:45,470
- This is the same as the last time.
- Hi!

819
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:47,950
This is the same as the last time.
They're all here?

820
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:53,857
[Lupin Kwang Soo is in danger!]

821
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:58,060
- I think they're here for a reason.
- It's the same as the last time.

822
00:53:58,061 --> 00:54:01,867
[No way...]

823
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:07,618
- I think they're here for a reason.
- It's the same as the same time.

824
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,177
I know, they were here
the last time too.

825
00:54:17,138 --> 00:54:22,685
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, out.
Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

826
00:54:24,776 --> 00:54:26,416
<i>The events of the past have changed.</i>

827
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:31,437
<i>So we will be announcing that you've been
ousted the moment you start your mission.</i>

828
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:34,569
- Wait...
- We never announced Ji Suk Jin being ousted.

829
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,056
<i>But we're going to announce that
you've been ousted.</i>

830
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:39,261
Why would I be ousted?

831
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:43,525
[Time travel will change
the events of the past.]

832
00:54:43,526 --> 00:54:44,929
Yes, the events of the past have changed.

833
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,203
I remember that the last time
you guys were here...

834
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:50,478
[Lupin Kwang Soo's quick decision.]

835
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:53,349
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

836
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:59,977
[The announcement of you being ousted...
tells me that you're Lupin.]

837
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:03,581
What just happened?
It's you?

838
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:11,724
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

839
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,795
I took the pill.

840
00:55:13,796 --> 00:55:17,967
[Detective Jae Suk is eliminated
the moment the race starts.]

841
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:21,141
- Lee Kwang Soo, out.
- What?

842
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,066
- Yoo Jae Suk, out.
- What? The race just started!

843
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,014
Seriously? Or is this a lie?

844
00:55:28,571 --> 00:55:30,256
They're seriously ousted?

845
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:32,959
[No one can believe that Jae Suk
is already ousted out of the race.]

846
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,403
What did he do?

847
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:36,076
Who's the culprit?

848
00:55:36,405 --> 00:55:38,155
Then who's Lupin?

849
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:43,276
I guarantee... that the first person
ousted is the real culprit.

850
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:45,532
Because that's the way I wrote this race.

851
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,100
[Hmm...]

852
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,626
Remember what happened the last time
even though Suk Jin wasn't ousted?

853
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:54,196
So wouldn't it be either Kwang Soo
or Jae Suk this time around too?

854
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,139
Ugh, seriously.

855
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,388
I can't believe that I've been ousted
the moment the race started.

856
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:04,629
This is the first time since being on the show
that I've been ousted the moment I started.

857
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,695
[Rewriting history of Running Man.]

858
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:14,053
[A mysterious card that appears after
a member is ousted just like the last time.]

859
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:16,419
[Could it be?]

860
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:29,919
<i>I have to come up with a plan.</i>

861
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:39,245
[Kwang Soo orders Hao Chao to observe
others and to search for the briefcases.]

862
00:56:39,246 --> 00:56:41,646
Hi, Song Ji Hyo.

863
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:46,100
[Greeting the other members loudly to let
Kwang Soo know of their whereabouts.]

864
00:56:50,692 --> 00:56:58,985
[Lupin Kwang Soo is flustered
and doesn't know what to do.]

865
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:02,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

866
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,208
- Where's Chao Chao?
- Hello.

867
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:07,824
It's just the three of us.
No Chao Chao.

868
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,507
Oh, he's not here?

869
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:12,548
[They lie to Ji Hyo and
tell her that Chao Chao isn't with them.]

870
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:15,089
Have you seen the other members?
No, you haven't seen them?

871
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,510
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

872
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:20,278
[Detective Blank Ji doesn't suspect anything
and is just happy to have seen them.]

873
00:57:23,328 --> 00:57:26,052
[Tightly holding onto the door
to keep it shut.]

874
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:28,198
I didn't know that I'd be this nervous.

875
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:31,782
So Suk Jin actually did a good job
when he did it.

876
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:35,863
Take a look and see if there's
anyone out there.

877
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:39,669
I'll just stay back here.
I'm not going to move at all from here.

878
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:44,884
[Lupin Kwang Soo doesn't even budge
from the room that he's hiding in.]

879
00:58:01,013 --> 00:58:06,483
[Lupin Kwang Soo's special characteristic-
Bravery of a bird.]

880
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:12,136
[Regardless of the matter, it looks as though
he's seriously about to start the search.]

881
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:20,535
[Following Chao Chao's signal...
Lupin dashes out of his hiding spot.]

882
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:22,986
[Huh?]

883
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:25,353
[Instead of searching for
the detectives...]

884
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:29,257
[Lupin Kwang Soo hides himself away
in a darkened room?]

885
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:32,755
When you knock on the door,
knock on the door like this.

886
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:36,029
I was just wondering...

887
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,864
I can't squeeze into that dog costume
with Chao Chao, can I?

888
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:42,656
[Wanting to hide himself away in a place
where no one could ever find him.]

889
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:47,762
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- How are they ousted the moment we start?

890
00:58:47,763 --> 00:58:51,295
- Just like when you did it...
- It's the first person that gets ousted.

891
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:53,987
- I agree.
- The first person ousted is the culprit.

892
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,493
- Yes, it was like that with you too.
- I was the first person ousted.

893
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:59,659
But the difference is, they never
announced that you were ousted.

894
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,501
- We just saw you getting dragged away.
- Yes, you're right.

895
00:59:02,502 --> 00:59:03,762
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah, I remember that.

896
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:07,910
But I think the situation changes a little
like the butterfly effect.

897
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:10,331
I'm telling you that it really isn't me.

898
00:59:10,332 --> 00:59:12,492
- But I think...
- Just trust me, Jong Kook.

899
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:19,514
[Suspecting the original Lupin, Suk Jin,
of being the culprit.]

900
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,585
Whether I win the race or not...
Look, those two are together.

901
00:59:21,586 --> 00:59:23,457
- That's weird.
- Who?

902
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:25,976
Come here.

903
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:28,070
- Guys.
- Kwang Soo and Jae Suk...

904
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:31,023
- Have you two been together this whole time?
- No, we just ran into each other.

905
00:59:31,024 --> 00:59:34,190
- You two just ran into each other, right?
- Yeah, we only just saw each other now.

906
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:36,021
[Still unsure of
each other's true intentions.]

907
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:39,134
Having ousted two members so quickly like that
requires more than just one person.

908
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,848
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I had some help back then too.

909
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:44,839
- Yes, you had helpers.
- I'm sure that the culprit has helpers.

910
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,774
- To oust two people so quickly like that?
- The culprit must have helpers.

911
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:49,029
- But how can they both be ousted already?
- Have you two been together all this time?

912
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,068
We just ran into each other
a little bit ago.

913
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:56,019
[While everyone else is busy suspecting
each other, Ace Ji Hyo springs into action.]

914
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:06,280
[She's focused on finding the treasure.]

915
01:00:21,332 --> 01:00:24,152
[Oh?]

916
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:29,064
[But they told me that
Chao Chao wasn't here...]

917
01:00:32,926 --> 01:00:35,977
We have to find the briefcases.

918
01:00:41,587 --> 01:00:45,360
[Something doesn't feel right!]

919
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,222
[Kwang Soo?]

920
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:13,111
[But the announcement said
that he's been ousted...]

921
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:22,087
[I must hurry!]

922
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:27,208
[I have to let the others know
of this truth!]

923
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:36,414
[Hao Chao are busy searching for the
briefcases that contains the name tags.]

924
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,940
[Discovers a briefcase!]

925
01:01:53,514 --> 01:01:56,792
[Chao Chao pulls his weight!]

926
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,624
How is this being the star of the show?

927
01:02:06,446 --> 01:02:08,144
You found a briefcase?

928
01:02:11,346 --> 01:02:17,521
[Chao Chao can only search for the briefcase,
but only Lupin can move or open it.]

929
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,432
Which drawer?

930
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,263
Where?
Where is it?

931
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:25,510
Over there?

932
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:31,407
[Lupin Kwang Soo finds his
first briefcase!]

933
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:36,204
[Ji Hyo is still rushing
to find the other members.]

934
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:43,328
[Kwang Soo, with the briefcase in hand...]

935
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:46,624
[Rushes back into his darkened room!]

936
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:53,828
[The moment he tears off the name tag,
that member is eliminated from the race!]

937
01:02:58,803 --> 01:03:02,381
[Ji Suk Jin]

938
01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:07,003
I'm sure Suk Jin is being suspected
by the other members right now.

939
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:09,021
I'm so curious right now.

940
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:12,411
I'm so curious because this person is
going to get the chance to live out my dream.

941
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,793
- It's you though, isn't it?
- I'm telling you that it isn't me.

942
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,236
It doesn't make any sense otherwise.

943
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:21,314
[Suk Jin is still the only one being suspected
by all the detectives.]

944
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:24,965
- Yes, I know I was upset when I didn't win.
- So this is another chance for you to do it.

945
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:26,252
[Still unable to escape their suspicion.]

946
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:30,774
[Just then, Ji Hyo makes her appearance
on the scene.]

947
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,334
I've missed you guys!
Chao Chao...

948
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,051
Chao Chao's gotten even bigger.

949
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:38,242
- Jong Kook.
- What took you so long to find us?

950
01:03:38,243 --> 01:03:40,301
- Kwang Soo's still alive.
- He's still alive?

951
01:03:40,302 --> 01:03:42,584
- Kwang Soo's still alive.
- Then it has to be Kwang Soo.

952
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,198
[The jig is up!]

953
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,662
- Kwang Soo is still alive?
- He's still alive and I just saw him.

954
01:03:47,663 --> 01:03:50,796
- Is he out walking around?
- Yes, I just saw him walking around.

955
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:56,806
I know that Suk Jin has high hopes
for this race.

956
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:03,779
- But these guys were once my helpers.
- Wait, be quiet.

957
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:09,876
- Ji Suk Jin, out.
- Why am I ousted?

958
01:04:11,317 --> 01:04:13,028
Why am I ousted?

959
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:16,338
- Suk Jin, this isn't a name tag elimination.
- No, it's not the name tag elimination.

960
01:04:16,893 --> 01:04:19,232
[Shock]

961
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:22,016
- Who are these guys?
- But why am I ousted?

962
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:23,926
[Completely flustered as to why he's ousted
when he was only just standing there.]

963
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:27,783
Sorry, Suk Jin.

964
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:30,556
But your name was the first one I found.

965
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:34,216
<i>Hey, hurry up!</i>

966
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:37,202
<i>- Hurry up and come here, Gary!
- Were you two guys together?</i>

967
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:40,490
Suk Jin just got ousted
right in front of our eyes.

968
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:43,455
He just got ousted when his name tag
wasn't even ripped off.

969
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:48,418
[Figured out that the members can be ousted
without the name tag even being ripped off.]

970
01:04:48,419 --> 01:04:50,870
He was just standing along the wall like this,
and then we heard that he's been ousted.

971
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:52,468
- That's what just happened.
- He just got ousted.

972
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:54,068
Just what is going on?

973
01:04:54,467 --> 01:04:56,656
What were you guys doing?
Were you two together this whole time?

974
01:04:56,657 --> 01:04:58,171
We were together this whole time.

975
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,817
[In an extreme state of nervousness with
all the detectives right outside the door.]

976
01:05:03,206 --> 01:05:05,642
- I saw Kwang Soo still walking around.
- She said she saw him.

977
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:08,226
I really don't think I could ever do
anything like this ever again.

978
01:05:08,227 --> 01:05:10,074
I feel like I'm going to throw up right now.

979
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:13,540
Do you remember what happened the last time?
Suk Jin was the first one ousted too, right?

980
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:16,483
- No, they never announced that Suk Jin...
- Don't go near Chao Chao.

981
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:19,807
I touched all those guys earlier.
I even touched Chao Chao.

982
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:22,622
Maybe it's that we can't touch Chao Chao when
there are a certain number of us together.

983
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:25,301
[What a deduction...
Eliminated from petting Chao Chao?]

984
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:26,994
Don't touch Chao Chao.

985
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:30,381
- Don't touch Chao Chao.
- He's so cute and I just want to touch him.

986
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:32,287
- He's so cute.
- No, you can't.

987
01:05:32,288 --> 01:05:34,672
I wonder how cute it'll be
to pet him on his tummy.

988
01:05:34,673 --> 01:05:37,102
But look at how aged Chao Chao's skin looks.

989
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:39,609
[Could Chao Chao's sign of aging be
one of the butterfly effects?]

990
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:42,115
But it wasn't like this earlier.
Earlier when we were there...

991
01:05:42,116 --> 01:05:46,163
[The star of the show is
relegated to staying in this dark room.]

992
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:47,997
Please just go away!

993
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,791
[Along with having figured out
the identity of who Lupin is...]

994
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:57,994
I'm getting a weird feeling about this place.

995
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,037
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo arrive on the outdoor
area of 7th floor in search of the treasure.]

996
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:03,108
I'm sure there has to be a clue
around here somewhere.

997
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,849
[A card?]

998
01:06:14,439 --> 01:06:19,418
[A hint regarding the treasure is dropped
every time a member gets eliminated.]

999
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:20,976
- What is it?
- I just found this.

1000
01:06:22,026 --> 01:06:25,316
[The detectives find their first hint card.]

1001
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:27,288
Olympic Opening Ceremony.

1002
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:31,431
- When was the Beijing Olympics?
- Month, date and time.

1003
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:32,946
In 2008.

1004
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,268
- Yes, it was in 2008.
- 2008.

1005
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:38,086
- 2008.
- Since it was in 2008...

1006
01:06:38,087 --> 01:06:40,030
Then could it be on the eighth floor?

1007
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:45,288
[Could it be a hint regarding which floor
the treasure is kept hidden?]

1008
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,961
<i>I'm starting to feel dehydrated.</i>

1009
01:06:55,304 --> 01:07:00,768
[Lupin Kwang Soo's lonely existence.]

1010
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:06,238
I shouldn't have taken the pill.

1011
01:07:09,538 --> 01:07:11,850
<i>Lupin is...</i>

1012
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:17,033
- Suk Jin was caught when he was Lupin.
- That wouldn't have happened if it was me.

1013
01:07:17,147 --> 01:07:21,128
And I wouldn't stay in hiding
or anything like that either.

1014
01:07:21,129 --> 01:07:22,491
I would be very brazen about it.

1015
01:07:22,526 --> 01:07:26,684
I don't think that a person can be the big
dish if he or she constantly stays in hiding.

1016
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:30,964
[The small dish...]

1017
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:35,300
Is no one out there?

1018
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,171
Where are the other briefcases?

1019
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:40,399
[Lupin gets to see the light for
the first time in thirty whole minutes.]

1020
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,935
[It seems as though Hao Chao
has discovered another briefcase!]

1021
01:07:45,784 --> 01:07:46,893
Chao Chao.

1022
01:07:46,894 --> 01:07:48,381
<i>Hi Gary!</i>

1023
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:53,787
[Danger!
Detective Gary is seen in the area!]

1024
01:07:53,788 --> 01:07:55,377
- Are you speaking in English?
- I'm busy.

1025
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:06,637
[Hao Chao keeps their eyes on Gary.]

1026
01:08:06,638 --> 01:08:10,794
[Lupin Kwang Soo uses that time
to go in search of the briefcase.]

1027
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,242
Where is it?

1028
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:16,956
[Second briefcase is discovered.]

1029
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:23,160
[Breaks out in a dead run!]

1030
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:29,968
I really shouldn't have taken that pill.

1031
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:35,188
Please let it be Kim Jong Kook.

1032
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:37,716
Can you stop shooting me
and be on the lookout?

1033
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:41,181
[Lupin assigns a task to his own personal VJ.]

1034
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:43,276
Yell out 'Hao Chao' if you see anyone
coming near this room.

1035
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:48,732
[Films with the left hand,
and opens up the case with his right.]

1036
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:54,414
Song Ji Hyo!
I will now eliminate her.

1037
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,042
Song Ji Hyo is out.

1038
01:09:02,145 --> 01:09:03,834
Now that we've got this...

1039
01:09:04,536 --> 01:09:08,764
<i>Song Ji Hyo, Out.</i>

1040
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:12,890
[Second member to be eliminated
in plain sight.]

1041
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:15,451
- Ji Hyo!
- Hurry up and find the treasure!

1042
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:19,328
- Song Ji Hyo, out.
- What are we going to do, Gary? I'm scared.

1043
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,554
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1044
01:09:23,555 --> 01:09:25,936
[Yes!]

1045
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:33,202
Everyone... the Lupin that you've seen so far
hasn't been the real Lupin.

1046
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:36,574
What you just saw is the real original Lupin.

1047
01:09:36,933 --> 01:09:38,913
It's Lupin Kwang, The Phantom Thief.

1048
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:42,040
I'm going to eliminate
every single one of them.

1049
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:47,985
[His simulation may make others think
that he may be an actual phantom thief.]

1050
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:51,267
[Lupin Kwang, The Phantom Thief, in action.]

1051
01:09:51,268 --> 01:09:53,483
What you just saw...
is the real Lupin Kwang, The Phantom Thief.

1052
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:57,601
The dream Suk Jin never got to live out...
I vow that I will live it out for him.

1053
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,032
What I told you earlier about me not having
become the big dish...

1054
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:04,720
I take those words back right now.

1055
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:06,636
I've already grown above that.

1056
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:08,870
I'm the real spy in town.

1057
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:14,717
Where in the world in Lupin?

1058
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:18,548
- I still haven't even seen him.
- We need to search everywhere.

1059
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:20,584
Let's go search all the places that
we wouldn't normally search around in.

1060
01:10:20,585 --> 01:10:23,888
I bet there's something in a place where
it wouldn't be easy for us to get to.

1061
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:29,146
[Lupin Kwang Soo has changed!]

1062
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:34,725
[Maybe he really will be able to
eliminate everyone!]

1063
01:10:35,408 --> 01:10:38,225
[Lupin Kwang Soo has become braver
and more proactive!]

1064
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:41,534
Where?
Where is it?

1065
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:46,764
[Discovers the third briefcase!]

1066
01:10:54,744 --> 01:10:56,723
[Oh!
Gary is observing the CCTV cameras!]

1067
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,854
I see someone moving.
I just saw someone running by.

1068
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:06,563
[Lupin Kwang Soo is caught on CCTV!]

1069
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:18,843
[Once this person is eliminated,
then only two detectives will remain.]

1070
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,147
Please let it be Kim Jong Kook.

1071
01:11:21,148 --> 01:11:23,282
Please let it be Kim Jong Kook!

1072
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:29,159
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook!

1073
01:11:31,092 --> 01:11:34,561
[But unfortunately,
the briefcase contains Ha Ha's name.]

1074
01:11:36,612 --> 01:11:38,273
We can't just sit back and
do nothing, Ha Ha.

1075
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,567
We have to keep moving,
and make something happen.

1076
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:42,953
- We have to make things happen.
- We have to keep him on his toes.

1077
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:45,363
- What is it?
- Come towards the elevator.

1078
01:11:45,364 --> 01:11:48,615
- Why?
- I just saw something suspicious over there.

1079
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:54,471
If you were him, where would you go
if you didn't want to get caught?

1080
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:59,231
[Above the lockers.]

1081
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:03,340
What is it?

1082
01:12:09,448 --> 01:12:12,037
We have to stay together.
You know what he is like.

1083
01:12:12,038 --> 01:12:14,768
[Walks into the room
that Kwang Soo is hiding out in.]

1084
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:17,344
[If they walk into the room any further,
then Kwang Soo is sure to get caught!]

1085
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:20,162
<i>- I just saw something!
- Where?</i>

1086
01:12:20,163 --> 01:12:22,746
- I just saw something!
- Where?

1087
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:24,252
[He's caught.]

1088
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:26,369
- Don't come any closer!
- Who is it?

1089
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,522
Don't come any closer!

1090
01:12:27,523 --> 01:12:32,344
[Threatening them with Ha Ha's name tag
which he has yet to rip off.]

1091
01:12:33,536 --> 01:12:34,840
You want me to rip this off?

1092
01:12:35,924 --> 01:12:42,092
[Lupin vs Sherlock Holmes.
The imminent moment of truth!]

1093
01:12:42,306 --> 01:12:44,756
- I will rip this off!
- Wait, Lupin.

1094
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:52,698
[Rips off the name tag, and huh?]

1095
01:12:53,805 --> 01:12:55,854
No one is eliminated!
The tag hasn't been ripped off!

1096
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:03,483
[The amateur thief drops the briefcase
before the name tag is completely ripped off.]

1097
01:13:03,484 --> 01:13:05,467
See?
The tag hasn't been completely ripped off!

1098
01:13:12,282 --> 01:13:15,180
[Lupin Kwang Soo gets his name tag
ripped off instead!]

1099
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:18,406
[Sherlock Holmes wins!]

1100
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:21,437
No!

1101
01:13:22,964 --> 01:13:24,882
You're such an idiot!

1102
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:27,354
This is all he managed to rip off.

1103
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:36,336
[Lupin Kwang's newly rewritten history.]

1104
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:42,870
- Anyway, Lupin fails his mission.
- No!

1105
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,513
The psychic power episode.

1106
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:51,584
I wasn't able to rip off Gary's name tag
because of the Roll-Roll spell he used.

1107
01:13:51,585 --> 01:13:53,998
The victory was right in front of my eyes.

1108
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:56,084
That was seriously so disappointing.

1109
01:13:56,085 --> 01:14:02,032
I think the psychic power episode was one
episode which I'll never be able to forget.

1110
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:04,903
That's the second most episode
that I would like to go back to.

1111
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:07,687
I also remember the episode when
I had the power to manipulate time.

1112
01:14:07,688 --> 01:14:10,238
The second psychic power episode.

1113
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:16,892
I think that's the only episode in which
Jong Kook was the first to be taken to jail.

1114
01:14:17,937 --> 01:14:19,548
In all four years of the show.

1115
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:38,492
[The magical potion that was
given to the members.]

1116
01:14:38,493 --> 01:14:44,516
[Through these potions...
they are once again given psychic powers.]

1117
01:14:44,517 --> 01:14:46,767
- Just what kind of a power is it?
- Kim Jong Kook, come out!

1118
01:14:46,768 --> 01:14:50,191
[The fiercest battle in the history
of the show.]

1119
01:14:50,192 --> 01:14:54,803
[That historical moment...
will get rewritten today.]

1120
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:03,134
[The psychic battle starts again.]

1121
01:15:03,135 --> 01:15:09,139
[But the star of the psychic battle
gets swapped out.]

1122
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:15,313
[The same battle cannot exist.]

1123
01:15:19,823 --> 01:15:30,497
[Just who will be the new star
of the rewritten history?]

1124
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:34,628
[Ten minutes before the start of
the psychic battle.]

1125
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:37,360
It's the time for my favorite episode.

1126
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:39,899
December 25th, right?

1127
01:15:41,691 --> 01:15:44,021
The one who controls time!

1128
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:46,454
[The one man who wanted the power to
control the time again with his powers.]

1129
01:15:46,455 --> 01:15:50,569
[The original time controller, Ha Ha.]

1130
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,970
Ever since I was given the power
to control time

1131
01:15:51,971 --> 01:15:55,397
I was stuck in that role in my head
for like a year after.

1132
01:15:57,827 --> 01:16:01,622
[Stuck in the role of being
able to control time...]

1133
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,784
<i>The one who controls the time!</i>

1134
01:16:05,004 --> 01:16:08,935
[He at times would bring on the power
all on his own.]

1135
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:12,712
The one who controls the time!

1136
01:16:13,225 --> 01:16:15,587
[Would chant the spell
whenever he got the chance.]

1137
01:16:15,588 --> 01:16:20,416
[He even chanted the spell with
his herbal tonics.]

1138
01:16:22,115 --> 01:16:26,477
[Today is his chance to relive that moment.]

1139
01:16:27,461 --> 01:16:29,163
<i>Running Man time travel.</i>

1140
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:31,303
<i>The second psychic power episode.</i>

1141
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:34,779
<i>The last person left remaining through
the name tag elimination game wins the race.</i>

1142
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:40,214
<i>You have the power to assign the power to
other members for being the star of the show.</i>

1143
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:43,191
[Assign specific powers to others for being
the star of this specific mission.]

1144
01:16:45,908 --> 01:16:47,941
Just give me all the powers.

1145
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:53,016
Just give me all the powers.
I still may not win even with all the powers.

1146
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,281
Who's the strongest player we have?

1147
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:59,701
[Importance of distributing the powers...
What will Ha Ha do?]

1148
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:03,324
Time controller, Lee Kwang Soo.

1149
01:17:03,325 --> 01:17:08,245
[Space controller- Jae Suk,
Death Note- Suk Jin.]

1150
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:14,078
[Alter ego- Song Ji Hyo, Phoenix- Gary,
Master of sixth sense- Kim Jong Kook.]

1151
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:18,894
As for the power of deflection...
I will take that for myself.

1152
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,462
[Ha Ha takes the power of deflection
for himself.]

1153
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,210
You've just ousted yourself.

1154
01:17:25,211 --> 01:17:29,949
[The power of deflection to oust the person
who eliminates your name tag.]

1155
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:34,009
[The power that becomes more powerful
as the number of players narrows down.]

1156
01:17:35,046 --> 01:17:36,692
This will be my hidden ace card.

1157
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:39,013
[Ha Ha is aware of everyone's power,
and also has the power of deflection.]

1158
01:17:39,014 --> 01:17:41,895
[Will he be able to rewrite history
and become the new star?]

1159
01:17:50,058 --> 01:17:52,504
[Phoenix has three lives, and
only one person has the ability to oust him.]

1160
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,828
The one who controls time!

1161
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:03,107
[Has the power to turn back time
only once during the race.]

1162
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:13,355
[The power to oust any member,
at any given time, from any place.]

1163
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:25,193
[The power to move all members to one
specific place only once during the race.]

1164
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:35,587
[Has the power to sense what's about
to happen before crucial moments.]

1165
01:18:44,822 --> 01:18:46,853
[The power to create up to
four duplicates of herself.]

1166
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:57,239
[The power to be aware of
all other members' specific powers.]

1167
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:13,275
- You're the one with the Roll-Roll power?
- I have the Roll-Roll power.

1168
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:15,920
Wow, seriously... Ji Hyo.

1169
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:18,391
Jong Kook.

1170
01:19:18,426 --> 01:19:21,162
I told them so many times
that I don't need this power.

1171
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:23,548
I've told them over and over
that I don't need this power.

1172
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:27,689
[The Wi-Fi brother is disappointed
with the same power he previously had.]

1173
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,591
Song Ji Hyo is the duplicator?

1174
01:19:29,592 --> 01:19:33,446
[Song Ji Hyo is feeling confident
with all her Roll-Rolls.]

1175
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:36,503
- Song Ji Hyo's the duplicator?
- Song Ji Hyo is the duplicator.

1176
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:38,731
[All the psychic power holders are
starting to gather in one place.]

1177
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,345
We all look the same.

1178
01:19:40,346 --> 01:19:42,535
- You're all so pretty.
- You girls are like a girl group.

1179
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:44,861
- So cute.
- You're all so pretty!

1180
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:46,893
- We are, Roll-Roll!
- They seriously are all so pretty.

1181
01:19:46,894 --> 01:19:49,303
[The rest of the Roll-Rolls are
pretty as Ji Hyo is herself.]

1182
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:52,081
[An immediate fan club.]

1183
01:19:52,082 --> 01:19:54,813
Stay away.
You can't come near us.

1184
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:58,486
Can I love all four of you?

1185
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:01,342
I'm going to think of all four of you
as Song Ji Hyo today.

1186
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:04,530
Then I'm a part of four
Monday Couples today.

1187
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:08,267
Song Ji Hyo one, Song Ji Hyo two,
Song Ji Hyo three, Song Ji Hyo four.

1188
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:10,473
Why are you holding her hand right now?

1189
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:12,689
I'm a part of all these couples today.

1190
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:15,593
- They're all so cute.
- There are so many of them.

1191
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:18,981
But seriously, Ji Hyo.
You look like you're in a girl group.

1192
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:21,674
[Another super power of Roll-Roll
is their level of beauty?]

1193
01:20:21,675 --> 01:20:24,265
- So we don't know each other's powers?
- No, we don't know.

1194
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:27,136
But the person who took the pill would know
which power everyone else has, right?

1195
01:20:27,137 --> 01:20:28,523
Yes, that's right.

1196
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:32,242
[Only Ha Ha, who took the pill
knows which powers the others now has.]

1197
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:35,224
There's the power of deflection too, right?

1198
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:38,827
[This is getting dangerous.
I have to divert their attention.]

1199
01:20:38,828 --> 01:20:40,091
Suk Jin!

1200
01:20:40,092 --> 01:20:42,484
I think Suk Jin is death note.

1201
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,878
- Why do you say that?
- Because he's not here right now.

1202
01:20:44,879 --> 01:20:47,377
- Suk Jin isn't here.
- Maybe he's in hiding.

1203
01:20:47,378 --> 01:20:49,672
Let's go find Suk Jin first!

1204
01:20:49,673 --> 01:20:52,293
[Succeeds in diverting
their attention to Suk Jin.]

1205
01:20:52,294 --> 01:20:55,694
- Let's go!
- Roll Roll!

1206
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:58,130
I love you, I love you, and I love you too!

1207
01:20:59,135 --> 01:21:00,652
They're so cute.

1208
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:03,241
Wow, they're so cute.

1209
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:09,468
I have to find it quickly.
Seriously...

1210
01:21:09,862 --> 01:21:13,435
[Death Note- Big nosed Brother.]

1211
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:18,344
[Must find the death note first in order
to be able to use his power.]

1212
01:21:19,427 --> 01:21:21,387
I'll be done for if I don't find the card.

1213
01:21:21,388 --> 01:21:23,209
I'll be done for if I can't find it.

1214
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,844
Suk Jin.

1215
01:21:24,845 --> 01:21:27,929
[Just as Ha Ha intended,
Suk Jin becomes everyone's first target.]

1216
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,352
We have to find the death note first
and destroy it before Suk Jin finds it.

1217
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:34,218
Use your Roll-Roll power and tell them to
separate and find the death note.

1218
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:37,801
Maybe I can use my Wi-Fi power to
find out where the card is hidden.

1219
01:21:37,802 --> 01:21:40,157
- Use your power to find out where he is.
- My Wi-Fi?

1220
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,552
[Kkuk uses his sixth sense to figure out
where Suk Jin is at the moment.]

1221
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:46,247
- We have to find the death note.
- Do you know what the death note looks like?

1222
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,108
Ji Suk Jin is on the fifth floor.

1223
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:52,563
Ji Suk Jin is on the fifth floor.
The Wi-Fi range has gotten broader.

1224
01:21:52,564 --> 01:21:54,543
- That's nice.
- It's now 3G.

1225
01:21:54,544 --> 01:21:57,087
[The sixth sense has been upgraded
to be more fitting of the time.]

1226
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:02,302
Since Roll-Roll one knows what it looks like,
you can go start searching for it.

1227
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:07,116
If you find the card, signal to me by
yelling out, 'Roll-Roll', okay?

1228
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:10,846
- You too, okay?
- Kwang Soo, are you the Time Controller?

1229
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,366
Are you?

1230
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:15,641
[Bluntly asking him about his power.]

1231
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:17,517
It's similar to that.

1232
01:22:17,518 --> 01:22:19,267
What do you mean, it's similar?

1233
01:22:19,621 --> 01:22:22,118
Are you the Time Controller?
Show me what you have.

1234
01:22:24,394 --> 01:22:28,189
[Searching his body for any telltale items.]

1235
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:31,955
- It's not like I'm asking to have it.
- You can't do this.

1236
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,638
So you really are the Time Controller.

1237
01:22:35,639 --> 01:22:37,399
What are you doing?

1238
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:41,738
[Information on Giraffe's psychic power
is forced out of him.]

1239
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:43,967
- You can control time.
- Which power do you have?

1240
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:49,696
[You receive what you put out.]

1241
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:51,774
Seeing how there's paper crinkling in there,
you must be the Space Controller.

1242
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:55,381
- Where is he?
- Fifth floor.

1243
01:22:58,242 --> 01:23:02,946
[Big-nose still hasn't found
his death note.]

1244
01:23:04,516 --> 01:23:07,246
[Searching through every nook
and cranny of the building.]

1245
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:15,650
[The death note is right behind him!]

1246
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:18,510
I'm so worried that I'll get caught.

1247
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:23,818
[One of the Roll-Roll's spots Big-nose!]

1248
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:30,884
[Big-nose discovers the death note.]

1249
01:23:32,426 --> 01:23:34,022
I'm going to write it in right now.

1250
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:39,132
[Ji Hyo moves in upon receiving
the tip from her Roll-Roll.]

1251
01:23:39,544 --> 01:23:42,648
Yoo Ja- Suk.

1252
01:23:44,094 --> 01:23:51,747
[This power... is a power that was wielded
by the original death note holder, Kwang Soo.]

1253
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:56,493
[The names are written down with the
exception of one character of their names.]

1254
01:23:56,528 --> 01:24:01,128
[Then complete the writing of their name in
a moment of danger to oust them.]

1255
01:24:01,129 --> 01:24:07,136
[That's the power of the death note.]

1256
01:24:08,395 --> 01:24:10,072
Who are you going to use the death note for?

1257
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:15,421
[Ji Hyo verifies that the death note is
in Suk Jin's hands with her own two eyes.]

1258
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:16,795
I know who you're writing down.

1259
01:24:16,796 --> 01:24:19,419
Suk Jin, tell me who's name
you're going to write down.

1260
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:24,269
[Ji Hyo can't be hasty about attacking him
with the death note in his hands.]

1261
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:27,305
- Are you going to tell the others or not?
- I'm not sure if I will or not.

1262
01:24:27,306 --> 01:24:29,390
- I'm going to write down your name.
- Okay, go ahead and write it.

1263
01:24:30,086 --> 01:24:32,328
The time will get turned back anyway.

1264
01:24:37,362 --> 01:24:39,371
It's all over.

1265
01:24:42,004 --> 01:24:44,722
[Preparations to oust
the members are complete.]

1266
01:24:45,854 --> 01:24:53,052
[Who dares to call me a weakling?]

1267
01:24:53,053 --> 01:24:54,165
Who knew that I could ever
feel this much at ease?

1268
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:58,581
Who knew that I'd ever feel
this much at ease?

1269
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:07,144
[I'm not afraid of anyone.]

1270
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,758
Phoenix should just sacrifice his power.

1271
01:25:10,759 --> 01:25:13,696
I'm going to write down the name of the person
who offends me the most and leave the game.

1272
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:17,992
[Danger is imminent!]

1273
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:20,164
I'm going to complete writing down the name
of the person who steps any closer to me.

1274
01:25:20,165 --> 01:25:22,247
Then I can be ousted from the game.

1275
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:25,008
[All the members are now
gathered in one place.]

1276
01:25:25,009 --> 01:25:27,638
- Suk Jin has the death note?
- No one better step any closer to me.

1277
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:32,010
[Big-nose's death note is proving to be
much more lethal than Ha Ha had imagined.]

1278
01:25:32,011 --> 01:25:34,668
- You're name is Kang G-ry right now.
- Who's the phoenix?

1279
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:36,545
Would you be announcing it
if it were you?

1280
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:38,814
- This is so frustrating.
- One of you guys is the phoenix.

1281
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:41,502
- One of you guys is the phoenix.
- Me?

1282
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,058
One of you is the phoenix,
and the other is the deflector.

1283
01:25:44,865 --> 01:25:46,512
If I'm the phoenix,
then you can eliminate me right now.

1284
01:25:46,513 --> 01:25:48,299
You can eliminate the deflector.

1285
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,773
- Why would I?
- You took the pill, didn't you?

1286
01:25:50,774 --> 01:25:52,539
- Why would I tell you what my power is?
- You took the pill, didn't you?

1287
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,679
- What are you going to do about it if I did?
- You took the pill, didn't you?

1288
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,263
- What are you going to do about it?
- Rip it off!

1289
01:25:58,264 --> 01:26:00,591
Rip off his name tag right now.

1290
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:03,828
- He's the phoenix, so rip off his name tag.
- What if he's the deflector?

1291
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:06,603
- I'm telling you that he's the phoenix!
- I haven't even used my power yet.

1292
01:26:06,604 --> 01:26:08,565
I really want to use my power!

1293
01:26:09,018 --> 01:26:11,091
<i>Get Gary.</i>

1294
01:26:11,512 --> 01:26:14,383
[Gary is the phoenix!]

1295
01:26:14,384 --> 01:26:16,095
Gary?

1296
01:26:18,218 --> 01:26:20,719
[Target locked.]

1297
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:32,286
[Gary's name tag is eliminated.]

1298
01:26:33,933 --> 01:26:37,799
[Gary's power is revealed!]

1299
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,556
- So you took the pill, didn't you?
- I really didn't take the pill.

1300
01:26:42,162 --> 01:26:43,837
It really wasn't me!

1301
01:26:43,872 --> 01:26:46,188
- I didn't take the pill.
- Then Ha Ha is the deflector.

1302
01:26:46,189 --> 01:26:48,139
I really didn't take the pill.

1303
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,796
Ha Ha is the deflector.

1304
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:58,706
[This psychic battle is being carried out
completely different than the past battle.]

1305
01:26:59,157 --> 01:27:03,771
[Who will be the ultimate victor
of this new battle?]

1306
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:09,134
We have to convince Gary to
rip off Ha Ha's name tag.

1307
01:27:09,135 --> 01:27:11,139
I know where Gary is right now.

1308
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:13,283
Don't forget the power that I have, you guys.

1309
01:27:13,284 --> 01:27:15,280
[Jong Kook's sixth sense kicks in again.]

1310
01:27:15,281 --> 01:27:17,064
I'll find out where Gary is.

1311
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,423
If Suk Jin uses his death note on Ha Ha,
then we can oust him by ripping off the name.

1312
01:27:21,424 --> 01:27:25,559
- We can just do an ambush attack on Suk Jin.
- Gary is on the third floor.

1313
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,513
Gary is on the third floor.
Let's go up there right now.

1314
01:27:28,004 --> 01:27:30,194
Let's go meet up with Gary,
and I'll talk him into doing it.

1315
01:27:32,268 --> 01:27:34,278
- Who should I oust?
- Oust Kim Jong Kook.

1316
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:38,953
- Why do you want me to do it right now?
- Just write it down right now.

1317
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:41,400
- Stop hesitating and do it right now.
- Seriously.

1318
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:44,748
[Even though he's the death note holder,
elimination of his name means that he's out.]

1319
01:27:45,331 --> 01:27:48,014
Okay, fine.
I'll write Jae Suk down and be eliminated.

1320
01:27:50,786 --> 01:27:53,448
Write it, write it.
I was holding onto it.

1321
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:58,860
[Almost got eliminated before he even
got to write down anyone's name.]

1322
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:03,630
- You're seriously angering me.
- Hurry up and write it down.

1323
01:28:05,335 --> 01:28:07,201
Hurry up and write it.

1324
01:28:07,202 --> 01:28:10,650
You're almost there.
Write down Kim Jong Kook's name.

1325
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,084
We need to oust Dong Hoon first.

1326
01:28:14,085 --> 01:28:17,466
[Kkuk, Blank Ji, Gary and Kwang Soo
are now working together.]

1327
01:28:17,467 --> 01:28:20,244
- We need to find Dong Hoon.
- There he is right now.

1328
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:23,310
Here he comes.
Hurry up and write it down.

1329
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:25,251
Here he comes right now.
Hurry up and write it down.

1330
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:29,286
[Big-nose is still hesitating about his
decision up to the very last minute.]

1331
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:32,072
Here he comes right now.
Hurry up and write it.

1332
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:37,842
[The fate of Kkuk's life is left in
the hands of Big-nosed Brother.]

1333
01:28:37,843 --> 01:28:39,396
It's over for Kim Jong Kook now.

1334
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:46,442
[Just one more swipe of the pen...
and Jong Kook will be ousted.]

1335
01:28:51,271 --> 01:28:55,150
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1336
01:28:58,485 --> 01:29:02,290
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1337
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:17,161
[Jong Kook was the first one to get ousted
the first time around from Kwang Soo's note.]

1338
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:29,488
[The power of the death note
just made history repeat itself.]

1339
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:34,170
[Goodbye, Sixth Sense.]

1340
01:29:41,116 --> 01:29:45,168
[Impala is eliminated immediately
after having used up his death note power.]

1341
01:29:46,998 --> 01:29:51,715
[Dragged off to jail after doing a
good deed for the other members.]

1342
01:30:01,127 --> 01:30:04,477
[Ha Ha's power of deflection is activated!]

1343
01:30:05,207 --> 01:30:09,052
[The person who tries to oust the deflector
is immediately ousted himself!]

1344
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:12,660
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1345
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:14,945
I got your number now.

1346
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:22,593
[Without even having used his power...
the Space Controller is eliminated!]

1347
01:30:24,891 --> 01:30:27,137
I told you that he's the deflector.

1348
01:30:27,138 --> 01:30:29,821
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Are you trying to eliminate me?

1349
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:31,918
[Gary is the new target!]

1350
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:38,476
[Just as Ha Ha had intended,
everyone is now targeting Gary.]

1351
01:30:38,477 --> 01:30:39,884
Roll-Roll!

1352
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:46,819
[Gary has the distinct advantage
for being the only one with two name tags.]

1353
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:51,122
We won't be able to oust Gary otherwise.

1354
01:30:51,123 --> 01:30:53,515
[This is their one and only chance
to oust Gary!]

1355
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:56,219
Grab onto the name tag now.

1356
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,827
Grab onto the name tag.

1357
01:31:00,531 --> 01:31:01,881
Yeah, I got it.

1358
01:31:04,614 --> 01:31:07,438
[Gary's defensive moves.]

1359
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:15,036
[A fierce battle of six against one.]

1360
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,736
[One of Gary's name tags are eliminated.]

1361
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:29,343
[Second name tag is also eliminated.]

1362
01:31:32,213 --> 01:31:34,562
[Gary and Ha Ha both are almost
simultaneously ousted.]

1363
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:37,965
[Ji Hyo and Roll-Roll immediately
turn their attack on Kwang Soo.]

1364
01:31:39,232 --> 01:31:42,869
[I must... turn back the hands of time.]

1365
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:49,508
[Just need to pull out the watch and
recite the spell.]

1366
01:31:53,082 --> 01:31:54,796
No!

1367
01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:00,844
[The Roll-Rolls locks up both of
Kwang Soo's arms in a tight vise-like grip.]

1368
01:32:01,827 --> 01:32:04,236
Please let me go!
Let me go just this once!

1369
01:32:04,237 --> 01:32:08,520
[Please let me turn back the hands of time
just this once!]

1370
01:32:09,703 --> 01:32:12,125
I got it!

1371
01:32:15,716 --> 01:32:20,648
[Time Controller, Lee Kwang Soo- Out!]

1372
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:27,491
[Sharing this joy with her Roll-Roll's.]

1373
01:32:28,802 --> 01:32:31,758
- I told you that Roll Roll is the best.
- Roll Roll definitely is the best!

1374
01:32:31,759 --> 01:32:34,389
[The ultimate winner of the time travel race-
Song Ji Hyo!]

1375
01:32:37,092 --> 01:32:40,910
[The key to Ji Hyo's win- Roll Roll.]

1376
01:32:42,037 --> 01:32:44,231
- Roll Roll is the best.
- Roll Roll is definitely the best.

1377
01:32:44,232 --> 01:32:46,514
Can you make a double for me too?
Someone who's 190cm tall?

1378
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:50,276
I don't think they're going to find
anyone as tall as you are.

1379
01:32:50,277 --> 01:32:54,013
[The power of Roll-Roll is as powerful
as the strength of their beauty.]

1380
01:32:54,014 --> 01:32:56,467
- Who took the pill?
- I took it!

1381
01:32:56,468 --> 01:32:59,569
I knew that it was you.
That's why I ripped off your name.

1382
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,831
[Bickering to the end.]

1383
01:33:00,832 --> 01:33:04,240
Thus, the winner of today is,
Song Ji Hyo and Roll-Roll!

1384
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:07,915
[The ultimate victor of the race-
Song Ji Hyo and her Roll-Rolls!]

1385
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,294
Roll-Roll!

1386
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:14,683
