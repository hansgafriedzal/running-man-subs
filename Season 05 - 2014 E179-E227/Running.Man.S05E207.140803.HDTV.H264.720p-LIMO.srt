Subtitles by DramaFever

3
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:22,872
[All of Big-nose's humiliation
in the past four years.]

4
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:29,193
[Countless number of days where victory
was the furthest thing from his grasp.]

5
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:34,771
<i>I won!</i>

6
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:39,073
[But his victories were
like a figment of his imagination.]

7
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:42,980
[A feeling that he'd like to
re-live once again.]

8
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:57,609
<i>Can you... help me?</i>

9
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:03,583
- It's getting hotter by the day.
- It's the middle of the summer.

10
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,986
- It truly is summer.
- It's really hot.

11
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:12,145
Jae Suk, I shouldn't admit this, but
I didn't even realize Suk Jin wasn't here.

12
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,962
[Suk Jin's weak existence.]

13
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:22,566
- Where's Suk Jin?
- Take a look at this first, Jae Suk.

14
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,468
I'm really shocked right now.

15
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,295
As you may have guessed, Ji Suk Jin
will appear from behind the screen.

16
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,481
- There must be something planned.
- Please make the announcement, Jae Suk.

17
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,918
This is embarrassing to read out loud.

18
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,472
Did Suk Jin write this?

19
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,824
In rain or snow, this man can always
bring bouts of laughter to the audience.

20
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,123
The best of the best comedian,
Republic of Korea's very own Ji Suk Jin.

21
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:49,726
Over 15 years of experience ranging from
talk shows, quiz shows, and variety shows.

22
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:53,454
From every kind of genre you can think of,
this is the man who tops all the lists!

23
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,523
- Why is this so long?
- Is he even going to come on?

24
00:01:57,037 --> 00:02:02,207
From his on-the-spot hit songs that
he has created throughout the years...

25
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,217
What hit songs is he even talking about?

26
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,809
I'm so embarrassed for him.

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,468
And to all the victories that
he's taken home in all the years...

28
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,992
What?

29
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:14,472
[Big-nose did what?]

30
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,595
What is this?

31
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,043
[Finally making their appearance...]

32
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:39,002
[are Big-nose's closest friends!]

33
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:50,594
[A lively history with Suk Jin...]

34
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,898
[Their long history will continue
onto the muddy farm field.]

35
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,955
I have a bad feeling about this.
We're going to lose.

36
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,491
[The man of Korea's talk shows-
Nam Hee Suk.]

37
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,002
[And this gentleman...]

38
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:13,992
[The perfect team play over
ten years in the making.]

39
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:18,233
[He will sacrifice himself for Suk Jin.]

40
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:23,706
[The royalty of comedy- Park Soo Hong.]

41
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:33,703
[The man who never once
lost a verbal battle to Big-nose.]

42
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:39,110
[His verbal skills will become
one of Big-nose's biggest ally.]

43
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:44,540
[Verbal skills of a deity- Kim Jae Dong.]

44
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:53,391
[The young man whose first debut
was introduced by Big-nose himself.]

45
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:01,516
[The young man became a real man
and comes to Big-nose's rescue.]

46
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,955
[From a young man to a real man-
Kim Hee Chul.]

47
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,122
[Korea's biggest legends in talk shows
all come to gather in one place.]

48
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:15,152
Jae Dong?
What are you guys doing?

49
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:18,800
[And the star of today's show
finally makes his appearance.]

50
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,684
[A history of friendship that goes back
way farther than anyone could guess.]

51
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,115
[That friendship will prove to be
a huge support to Big-nose.]

52
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:36,552
[Unexpected goddess of variety world-
Lee So Yeon.]

53
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,653
[Today belongs to Big-nose!]

54
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:48,940
- Are you all ready?
- We are Big-nose's friends!

55
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:55,840
- Hey, let's do it one more time.
- We are Big-nose's friends!

56
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,679
- I called them all out.
- What are they all doing here?

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,932
I invited them all out on the show.

58
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,406
[They look to be better friends with the
rest of the Running Man cast members?]

59
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,116
Hey, I invited them all out!

60
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,188
[His friends abandon him,
and he's now the loner of the group.]

61
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,246
Why are you guys on such friendly terms?

62
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:24,945
The bottom line is, they all came on
the show to win today's race.

63
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:26,964
Please give them all a big
round of applause.

64
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,723
I would like to introduce them,
and tell you about our friendship.

65
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:38,626
- Jae Dong and I've been with the same agency.
- That was over ten years ago, right?

66
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:42,874
Yes, that was over ten years ago.
We'd go out drinking and chat together.

67
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,124
- We've all been out together.
- Yes, we have.

68
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,128
After you left, he said some nasty things
about you behind your back.

69
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,261
I don't believe that.
He'd never do that to me.

70
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,283
You look uglier today than
you ever have.

71
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:58,279
- What about Hee Chul?
- Do you even have any hair in the front?

72
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,099
If this is how you were going to treat me,
then you never should've invited me on.

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,171
We didn't invite you.

74
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:07,435
Just come over to my house
where there aren't any cameras around.

75
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:15,741
I've known Hee Suk since before
I even made my debut.

76
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,271
- I met him through Jae Suk.
- That's when the stations were struggling.

77
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:25,823
Even though it may look like Suk Jin
and I are really good friends

78
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:28,308
this is the first time
he's called me in over four years.

79
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:31,678
I wasn't even going to answer
because I didn't recognize his number.

80
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,418
When I didn't answer his call,
he sent me a text instead.

81
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,458
His text said, 'It's me, Suk Jin.'

82
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:41,794
- Hee Suk and I are really close though.
- No, he's my good friend.

83
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:49,410
Suk Jin and I worked on the gag concert
audition together so that we could win.

84
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:52,595
- Yes, I had forgotten about that.
- Kim Gook Jin helped us plan it.

85
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,887
[Soo Hong played a big role in helping
Suk Jin get started in the business.]

86
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,926
- Hee Chul's usually not this quiet either.
- You know what he said to me earlier?

87
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:03,161
'Make Suk Jin stop this.'

88
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,309
Why would you say something like that?

89
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,486
Hee Chul didn't need to worry about that.
We thought it was funny.

90
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,138
It truly is an honor to be on
such an elegant show as this one.

91
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:26,106
Nice!
That was a really good comment.

92
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:32,325
Before he became a member of Super Junior,
he first made his mark by being on our show.

93
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,494
[Made his first debut by being on Big-nose's
show before becoming a member of SJ.]

94
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,800
- He was on my show for his debut.
- What about So Yeon?

95
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:43,574
- With So Yeon...
- I was on that show too.

96
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:45,987
You didn't remember that, did you?

97
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,564
- Wasn't it on the show, 'Hi-five'?
- No, it was on the other show.

98
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:52,605
These people are some of my closest friends.
They're like family members to me.

99
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,583
Then are we going to be competing against
Suk Jin and his group of friends?

100
00:07:56,584 --> 00:08:02,535
Suk Jin tried for over two months to
personally invite these guests on the show.

101
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,918
That's why they're all on the show today.

102
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,667
So today's race is titled,
'Big-nose's Victory Race.'

103
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:11,671
[Big-nose's Victory Race]

104
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:14,213
We will start the race by giving everyone
one of these gold bars.

105
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:16,401
Okay, everyone may now each take one.

106
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,288
Running Man is awesome.

107
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,733
- Can I just take this?
- So Yeon really likes her gold!

108
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:26,455
[Could So Yeon be the new Gold Lady?]

109
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:33,641
Big-nose will be given slight advantages
to help him gain his victory in today's race.

110
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:37,888
You can choose one, but there are
a variety of advantages for you.

111
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,147
You can reuse those advantages
with each new game that you'll play today.

112
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,545
- Go with Lee So Yeon's card.
- Yes, that looks like a good one.

113
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,184
I doubt it'll be a dud.

114
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:55,830
- Double the gold!
- You chose the 'double the gold' option.

115
00:08:56,243 --> 00:09:01,199
Every time your team wins a round of games,
the amount of your gold will double.

116
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:05,153
How is this going to help us win?

117
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:09,122
The more gold bars you have, the bigger the
advantage you'll have at the final competition.

118
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:12,816
- So that's a good thing.
- Can we see whose name was a dud?

119
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:14,441
Yes, you may.

120
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:25,301
[They are off to a good start,
and it's time to start the mission!]

121
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:35,874
So we got the 'double the gold' card.

122
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:39,957
Since the more gold we have, the better,
let's work really hard today.

123
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,060
Because this is real gold.
But what if the other team wins?

124
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,012
We'll just each take care of
one opponent.

125
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,535
Hee Chul can take care of Jong kook.

126
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,217
[Hee Chul in charge of the Tiger?]

127
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:56,476
I don't know what today is going to be,
but let's not be too kind to Suk Jin.

128
00:09:56,477 --> 00:10:01,657
- Why would we let him win? This is our win.
- He needs to be stepped on to survive.

129
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,795
That's the only way to make sure that an
episode like this doesn't happen again.

130
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:06,707
We need to end it for good so that
he doesn't think of doing this again.

131
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,595
Okay, let's make sure of that today.

132
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,878
[Arrives at their first destination.]

133
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,976
It's a muddy farm field.

134
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:25,921
[Welcome!
It's the season of muddy farm fields.]

135
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,799
Look at all the water.
It's actually not that bad.

136
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,358
Hee Suk, you've never done anything
like this before, have you?

137
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:39,256
[First time experience for both Hee Suk
and Soo Hong in 24 years since their debut.]

138
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:43,684
[The masters of the variety world have never
experienced this before in their years.]

139
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,777
Let's go back to the studio.

140
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,685
[Comforts of a studio where it's cool
in the summers and warm in the winters.]

141
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,245
[Have only basked in the comforts of a studio-
Nam Hee Suk and Park Soo Hong.]

142
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,776
This is the first time in my life that I've
ever stepped foot in a farm field.

143
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,495
You know what I've always said whenever
I saw Jae Suk doing things like this?

144
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:02,555
That Jae Suk has the right to be making
the kind of money that he makes.

145
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,662
- He deserves to get paid his money.
- Do you know what Hee Suk texted me?

146
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:10,405
He would text me things like,
'I enjoyed watching your show today, Jae Suk.'

147
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,814
'Must you really do those things
on the show?'

148
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:15,155
But here he is on the show today.

149
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:17,975
[Here's your chance to experience it
for yourself today.]

150
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:22,146
We've prepared a game for you to get warmed
up and earn yourselves another gold bar.

151
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:26,260
We're already warmed up.
There's no need for this.

152
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,812
We felt that our guests would need
some time to get used to the field

153
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:33,253
so we're going to be playing a game of,
'Spin a circle with the woman in your arms.'

154
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:38,272
The male members will have to spin
the woman on their team once

155
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,578
around their waist without dropping
them in the water in a relay form.

156
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,110
Even if we try to drop her,
Ji Hyo won't let herself fall in the water.

157
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,501
[A game specifically geared
towards Ace Blank Ji.]

[However...]

276
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:49,600
[Big-nose without friends by his side
is a weakling indeed.]

277
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:57,095

278

on all your episodes.

[Even though he works hard,
doing it alone is impossible...]

will catch the disc first?]

[Team RM wins three gold bars.]

307
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:50,230
You guys are dirty players.

308
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:53,051
- We're not dirty players.
- We're not letting you get away with it.

309
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:57,077
- Let's play a clean game.
- We'll show you what dirty playing really is.

310
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:02,509
- You'll be shocked at how dirty we can play.
- We're not dirty players.

311
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,483
We will now move onto the second location.
You may get on your way.

312
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,635
Can't we just finish taping it here?

313
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,903
This is just the first location?

314
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:15,254
[We're only just getting started.]

315
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,478
Soo Hong, we're really trying to win.
Do you think that we can win?

316
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:29,292
- There's no way that you'll win.
- I can't believe we lost the first game.

317
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,542
It's not just the first game,
but you're going to lose the rest too.

318
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:35,698
I bet my guest appearance fee,
and my phone number on you losing.

319
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,984
Why would you bet your phone number?

320
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,569
Just in case.

321
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,358

is a really good drinker.

322
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,747
- Yes, she likes to drink.
- Tell us that one story again, Suk Jin.

323
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:55,473
It's a really old story. It's something
that happened a long time ago.

324
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,869
- She says she doesn't drink anymore.
- This happened ten years ago.

325
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,432
- What happened?
- We all went out to drink one night.

326
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,970
I knew that I should see her home just to
make sure that she got home safely.

327
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:08,302
[Suk Jin tries to get So Yeon
safely back home.]

328
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:13,555
She lives in Mokdong, so I put her in a cab,
and told the driver to take her to Mokdong.

329
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,998
But as soon as she gets in the cab,
she gets out the other door.

330
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:20,639
[Why is he telling all these stories?]

331
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,019
Since So Yeon is here, we need to play
the ideal man roulette game.

332
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,009
[Time to play Ideal Man Roulette!]

333
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,685
Okay, we're going to get this
game started!

334
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:35,716
Ugh, I miss Guk Joo!

335
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:39,176
Are you ready?
Okay, here we go with the first round!

336
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:42,169
[Fixing up his hair.]

337
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,448
Ji Suk Jin or Gary!
One, two, three!

338
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,888
Ji Suk Jin!

339
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,229
That's a total insult!

340
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,246
[How can this be?]

341
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,825
- You have to be serious.
- She just said that she's serious!

342
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,962
Okay, next round.
Kim Hee Chul or Park Soo Hong.

343
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,378
- One, two, three!
- I don't know!

344
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:04,806
- One, two, three!
- Kim Hee Chul!

345
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:10,205
Why do you even look surprised?
It's Kim Hee Chul.

346
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,418
- I have really nice legs!
- But your shorts are really short.

347
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,640
[Wearing his hot pants to look young and hip.]

348
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,758
He's pissed off for real.

349
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:29,319
[I'm not playing with you anymore.]

350
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,558
Next!
Kim Jae Dong or Yoo Jae Suk!

351
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,636
- One, two, three!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

352
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,720
If this is how you're going to treat me,
then why did you even invite me on the show?

353
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,404
You guys could've done
the show by yourselves.

354
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:45,865
This is ridiculous.

355
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,886
Suk Jin, Jong Kook and I
are the only ones left now?

356
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,784
Those three are left, but you should take
one of them off the list first.

357
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:55,379
Should we eliminate one of them?
So Yeon, you can eliminate someone.

358
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,212
Kim Jong Kook, Yoo Jae Suk, or Ji Suk Jin.
Eliminate one from the list.

359
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,010
Kim Jong Kook.

360
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,801
She has bad taste in men.

361
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:11,139
- Okay, then onto the next round.
- It's the final round.

362
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,550
Final round.
Ji Suk Jin or Yoo Jae Suk. One, two, three!

363
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:14,895
Yoo Jae Suk.

364
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:19,290
[So Yeon's Ideal Man Roulette-
Yoo Jae Suk wins!]

365
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:24,801
[Who is this game of roulette
supposed to be for?]

366
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:29,832
[A bus full of disgruntled men.]

367
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,842
Ji Hyo, let's play a round of
this game for you too.

368
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:36,629
[Ji Hyo's round of Ideal Man Roulette.]

369
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,609
Season two, Song Ji Hyo's episode!

370
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,082
- I really don't want to lose this round.
- Who should we pin Jae Suk up against?

371
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,283
I want to go up against him.

372
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:50,111
Okay, me and Gary!
Let's do this.

373
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:54,341
Yoo Jae Suk and Kang Gary.
One, two, three!

374
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:55,714
Kang Gary!

375
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:05,088
[Celebrating as if they've just won
a World Cup match.]

376
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,798
I did it!

377
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:15,065
[Disgruntled by her choice.]

378
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,477
[The riders on the bus becomes of one mind
with Jae Suk's elimination.]

379
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:25,037
Must you really react like this?

380
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:31,181
Park Soo Hong and Ha Ha.
One, two, three!

381
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,539
Ha Ha!

382
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:37,643
I'm getting off this bus!

383
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:40,710
Please open the door!

384
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:50,208
[What could you not like about me?
I even wore my hot pants today!]

385
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:54,450
- They look like your underwear.
- Those pants are awful!

386
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:00,189
Married men can't wear pants like these.

387
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,161
One of my sisters has
the same pair of shorts.

388
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:11,150
[Team SJ vs Team RM-
Arrives at their second location.]

389
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:14,722
- Are you upset?
- Bring me my pants!

390
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:18,466
- Why are you getting upset over that?
- I want to change out of these shorts.

391
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,525
He's upset for real right now.

392
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:23,357
Those hot shorts used to be really popular
when Soo Hong used to wear them in the past.

393
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:26,585
Soo Hong is really upset right now.

394
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:30,178
- You should just accept it for what it is.
- Those shorts are way too short!

395
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,430
Stop being pissed, and come over here.

396
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:38,287
I'm just going to totally go for it.
I'm going to start wearing them like this.

397
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:42,180
- I'm just going to wear them like this.
- You have no muscles in your legs.

398
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:45,181
What are you talking about?
My legs are nothing but muscle!

399
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,877
Look at how pretty my legs are!

400
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:52,565
[His legs could give the girls of
Girls Generation a run for their money.]

401
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:57,969
[Married man Hee Suk faces defeat
unlike his once wildly popular days.]

402
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,004
I don't like these girls either.

403
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,192
I don't get treated this badly
on any other shows I go on.

404
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,939
I'll come up with another game later
so stop worrying so much.

405
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,548
[Yoo Hyuk is working hard to
console hot pants loving Soo Hong.]

406
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,610
[Unsatisfied with Yoo Hyuk's efforts.]

407
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:14,172
You're off the list too.

408
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,504
Soo Hong used to totally disregard me
during his popular days.

409
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:24,823
- You saw that too, right, Hee Suk?
- Yeah, I did.

410
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,405
Your day is coming too and you'll see.

411
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:31,604
[Revenge 20 years in the making.]

412
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:38,481
Your next game is the playground loyalty game
which will test the bounds of your loyalty.

413
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,671
[Playground Loyalty Game]

414
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:46,749
Each member of the team will play a part
in a mission related to the number, 100.

415
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,862
If Ji Suk Jin's team wins,
then they will twice the amount of gold.

416
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:52,610
If Team RM wins,
then they'll just win two gold bars.

417
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:58,547
- We have to win this game.
- I've already lost my motivation.

418
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:03,095
We have to help me win this one.
I've only had two wins in four years.

419
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:05,709
What do you think we should do?
Gong-gi game?

420
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:09,424
[Team SJ has the first round of selections.]

421
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:11,842
- Drinking something may be hard.
- How about the slide?

422
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,221
Okay, let's go with the slide.
We'll go with the slide.

423
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:17,872
- They'll go with the slide.
- The slide is behind you to the right.

424
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,584
[What will they have to do on the slide?]

425
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:23,966
You have to go down the slide 100 times.

426
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,540
[Mission- Go down the slide 100 times.]

427
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:30,404
[What did he just say?]

428
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:32,823
[Down the slide 100 times?]

429
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:35,791
- How are we going to do that?
- Slide down 100 times?

430
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:39,353
What do you think you're doing right now?
How are we going to slide down 100 times?

431
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:42,096
Look at Soo Hong.
What's he going to do?

432
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:47,476
Sorry to ask this, but can I not do that?
It's a little embarrassing.

433
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:50,360
- It's embarrassing.
- What are you doing?

434
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:04,395
[The once popular man is trying to offer
up his sense of humor from 20 years ago.]

435
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:09,930
All six members of the team can take turns to
go down the slide a total of 100 times.

436
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,794
Once you go down the slide

437
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:15,246
you have to climb back up on the other slide
to slide back down on the first slide.

438
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,047
If you get tired, then you can
swap with another team member.

439
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:25,740
But you must slide down a total of 100 times
and the team to complete it first wins.

440
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:28,149
So this is a test of our endurance?

441
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,533
I haven't been working out much lately,
so this can be my workout.

442
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:34,068
- Do you all understand the rules?
- I'll just think of it as a workout session.

443
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:41,148
[Loyalty game one hundred-
One hundred times down the slide.]

444
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:45,611
[Team RM to take the first turn.]

445
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:51,013
- Misters, watch carefully on how we do it.
- Keep that up, and you'll get beat.

446
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:54,519
- What did you say?
- You won't even know who hit you.

447
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,489
Just like this.
Us group of 'misters' will beat you up.

448
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:01,077
I don't know if Kwang Soo can even fit
since this is a child's sized slide.

449
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,445
We're going to win this, aren't we?

450
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:05,593
Okay, get ready!

451
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:12,957
[Slide one hundred times- Team RM.]

452
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,428
[Slide challenge is proving to be
much more difficult than expected.]

453
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,103
This is hard.

454
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,379
- That was only his second slide.
- You expect us to do this 100 times?

455
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:32,724
[That's why we call it 'The loyalty game'.]

456
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:35,010
You have to do it as many
times as you can.

457
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:39,626
[Proving to be difficult
for even speedy Gary.]

458
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:42,936
[Only his fifth slide.]

459
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:51,770
How about we chat about current events
while he's running around in circles?

460
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,525
Okay, I'm feeling it now.

461
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:08,226
This is really hard. This is the
toughest game we could've picked.

462
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:11,499
- How many have you done? Eight?
- No, this is his tenth.

463
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,142
[He never slid down the slide this much
even as a kid.]

464
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,645
You're like a different man now
from when you first started.

465
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:25,704
[First turn- Twelfth turn.]

466
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:29,076
[The real Gary has gone and disappeared.]

467
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,266
I haven't seen you like this in a long time.

468
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,757
Four more, just do four more.
We need you to get 20.

469
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:45,506
Four more, just do four more.
We need you to get 20.

470
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:47,733
Hurry and climb up there!

471
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,900
Okay, let's have the next person go
when he finishes this round.

472
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,397
[Depleted of his energy.]

473
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,952
[Gary touches off to Ha Ha after 17 slides.]

474
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:10,194
He's much quicker because he's shorter.

475
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:15,088
[Second runner- Ha Ha.
Short height means more speed.]

476
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,876
The way I see it, he'll probably keep
this up until his fifth slide down.

477
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:22,385
- This is only his third slide down.
- Wow, you're fast!

478
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:26,078
Okay, this is only his third slide down.
But he's going to start slowing down.

479
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,671
[Speedy Ha Ha is still quick on his feet.]

480
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:33,215
His eyes are slowly going to start to
roll backwards on his fourth slide down.

481
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,938
Then his eyes are going to roll completely
backwards on his fifth slide down.

482
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,874
[Will it be a different person sliding down
on this fifth slide?]

483
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:44,389
See?
He's completely different already.

484
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:48,753
[A magical slide that transforms a person from
when they first go in to when they come out.]

485
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:50,950
He looks like a suitcase that rolls out
of the conveyor belt at the airport.

486
00:36:50,951 --> 00:36:54,224
Take a good look at him.
He's like a suitcase at an airport.

487
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,788
[Baggage claim area.]

488
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,899
You're still really fast.

489
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,863
Hey, it's okay for you to quit now.

490
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:08,111
[Sweet and tempting voice of the devil.]

491
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:14,002
- This isn't going to get you anything.
- I still haven't seen my suitcase yet.

492
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:19,589
[Tired looking Ha Ha suitcase.]

493
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:23,268
[Sixteen rounds for Ha Ha-
Touches off at round 33.]

494
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:25,780
[Young blood, Giraffe, is on the move!]

495
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,953
[He's stuck!]

496
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,065
[Sad Giraffe with his long neck...]

497
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,305
Seriously!

498
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,641
Why did you bend down your head like that?

499
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:43,881
Seriously!

500
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:49,491
[Finally manages to complete his first round.]

501
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,019
- How many is that?
- How many has he done?

502
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,920
[45th round...]

503
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,724
- So Yeon wants to say something to you.
- There's no time for that!

504
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:05,659
- So Yeon has something to say to you.
- Want to grab a cup of coffee?

505
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,505
- What are you doing?
- Want to grab a cup of coffee?

506
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:13,267
- What are you doing!
- Get your head back on straight!

507
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:15,745
[Giraffe loses his head over one word
from a beautiful woman.]

508
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,671
Were you serious about that?

509
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,575
What are you doing!

510
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,638
Seriously!
What are you doing!

511
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:30,072
[Slide Fairy appears to Kwang Soo again
to weave him under her spell.]

512
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,544
[Shaved ice... what does that mean?]

513
00:38:41,004 --> 00:38:42,880
[Get over here!]

514
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,431
I was talking to her!

515
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,942
[Gets his magic hand ready.]

516
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,964
[Wow, the best record so far!
Kwang Soo completes 23 rounds on the slide!]

517
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,141
You can probably date a star now.

518
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,528
[A sudden burst of energy!]

519
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:19,722
Shoot her a heart!

520
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:23,292
[Shoots her a heart.]

521
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:29,977
[Total of 60 rounds down the slide-
Kwang Soo with 27 slides of his own.]

522
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:32,832
[Touches off to Blank Ji.]

523
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:36,163
[Giraffe is kicked out of the way.]

524
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:44,093
Hey, be careful.
You always make me worry about you.

525
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:49,634
Stick out your palm and slap them all
on the cheek as you slide down.

526
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:57,874
[That's our ace!
Maintaining her quick speed.]

527
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,219
Shouldn't you be getting married?

528
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:03,269
- That's good.
- You're doing a great job.

529
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,856
- Come on, Ji Hyo!
- I feel it!

530
00:40:05,857 --> 00:40:08,180
- You feel it?
- I feel it!

531
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,741
- Faster!
- You can do five more!

532
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,189
[Being considerate to a fellow member
was long lost three years ago.]

533
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,081
Get up there before I throw
you up there!

534
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,343
I can see your feet!

535
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:22,007
I can see your feet now.
Don't slow down and run!

536
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,586
[This is the loyalty between RM members.]

537
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,570
[Touches off to Yoo Hyuk.]

538
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:29,211
- How many is that now?
- You have to move faster, Jae Suk.

539
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:35,105
- Jae Suk is really fast.
- He's wearing the best outfit for this.

540
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:38,157
[Best pants to be wearing for this event.]

541
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:41,769
You're doing great, Jae Suk.

542
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,999
[As a member of RM should,
he's maintaining his fast speed.]

543
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,497
- You have to do 20.
- Just keep going for as long as you can.

544
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,182
I never knew there would be a time
when Jae Suk would ever stop talking.

545
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:01,340
[Conceding the remaining 20 laps
over to Mr. Capable.]

546
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:06,923
[Mr. Capable's workout sessions commences.]

547
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,245
[Wow, he's fast...]

548
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:18,848
The slide looks like it's gotten smaller.

549
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,223
- It's like the slide has gotten smaller.
- He's moving so fast right now.

550
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,485
His dream is to get paid for working out.

551
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,097
- He must be happy as a clam right now.
- It's all about the frame of mind.

552
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:31,185
Mister, it's all about the frame of mind.

553
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:36,524
[Reprimanded by Yoo Hyuk's bodyguard, Kkuk.]

554
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:38,204
I want to smack him too.

555
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:41,799
- You guys are...
- Get out of my way!

556
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:46,794
[We knew that was going to happen.]

557
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,976
You all just saw what Jae Suk did, right?
He acted like he just didn't get smacked.

558
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:51,959
- Did you see how he just pretended that?
- What are you talking about?

559
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,738
What are you talking about?
Who just got smacked?

560
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,621
[Battle of pride between these
forty something men.]

561
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:04,308
- Who are you saying just got smacked?
- Both of you, get out of my way!

562
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,357
Both of you, get out of my way!

563
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:12,692
- Two more!
- I feel it!

564
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:17,703
[Seemingly impossible slide mission
is nearing its end!]

565
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,890
[Only two more left to go...]

566
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,496
[Huh?]

567
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:31,679
[Kkuk mistakes the count down the slide.]

568
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,993
Having to do one more when you already think
that it's over is the hardest one to do.

569
00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:37,348
This is killing him right now.

570
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:44,205
[Team RM- Slide mission complete.]

571
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,937
We will reveal your time record once
your opponent team completes their mission.

572
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,213
- That's when we'll reveal your time.
- Let's just say that we lost.

573
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:54,027
[Team SJ's sneaky plan not to
even shed a drop of sweat.]

574
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,135
- We'll let you take the gold bars.
- We'll let you take the pride too.

575
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:00,467
- We'll let you take it all.
- Okay, we lost.

576
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:03,492
That really looks difficult.
I've never seen Jong Kook panting like that.

577
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:07,747
- In all four years of doing this show.
- I should include this in my workout routine.

578
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:13,175
[Kkuk is in love with
the slide workout routine.]

579
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:15,300
I haven't been able to workout
for the past few days.

580
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:21,718
- Hee Chul can go first.
- I had a really bad slide experience.

581
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,015
You have to work really hard right now.

582
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,300
- You're going to have to do all 100.
- You have to do a lot of it yourself.

583
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:29,154
I'll do all 100 by myself.

584
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,626
You have to get a lot done.
We have to win this race!

585
00:43:31,627 --> 00:43:34,743
- We have to win today's race!
- I can do all 100 by myself.

586
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:37,182
That's a good idea, Suk Jin.

587
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:39,823
I was a pro on the slide
when I was still back in school.

588
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:44,148
Okay, we'll see how well you do.

589
00:43:44,149 --> 00:43:46,687
- How am I going to do this?
- Get ready!

590
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,651
- I never workout.
- Ready!

591
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:54,778
[Slide loyalty game- Team SJ!]

592
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:59,757
[How is a once slide pro, Hee Chul doing?]

593
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:03,230
- He's already feeling it.
- Already?

594
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:06,342
[Can't be... Already?]

595
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,854
- It always hits me really fast.
- You told us that we were acting childish.

596
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:17,350
Keep bringing him down like that.

597
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:21,634
I'm thinking about my health right now.

598
00:44:21,635 --> 00:44:23,728
This is like a health program.

599
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:29,693
- This is an elegant way of working out.
- Elegant?

600
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:32,627
[Even though you look like this?]

601
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,780
I look more dignified than that.

602
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:37,896
[His sense of humor is still unwavering.]

603
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:43,354
[Hee Chul is putting every ounce of
energy he has into the mission.]

604
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:48,050
I think he may be able to get
about 20 done.

605
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:51,322
Pick up the speed.
You're starting to slow down!

606
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:54,193
Hey, why are you slowing down so much?

607
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,328
This is really fun.

608
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:02,061
Yes!
The tiger butterfly...

609
00:45:02,062 --> 00:45:05,995
[Hee Chul's never disappointing
sense of humor.]

610
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:08,627
Who else would break out into a song
like that while going down the slide?

611
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:15,108
[Amazing!
Hee Chul touches off after 20 rounds.]

612
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:18,357
[Next up-
Team SJ's very own Mr. Capable, Hee Suk!]

613
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:21,179
Hee Suk can run 100m in 12 seconds flat.

614
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:28,208
[Wow, he's flying down the slide!]

615
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:31,674
[Already three slides down
in the blink of an eye!]

616
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:34,020
There it is!
He's feeling it now!

617
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:35,750
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

618
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,343
[After only three slides?
That's too quick!]

619
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:49,843
- Look at how he's cringing his face.
- Nam Hee Two!

620
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:56,863
But I'm still better than Park Soo Hong.

621
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:02,937
[After only six rounds... what?]

622
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:05,354
[Shamelessly asks to be tagged out.]

623
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:08,026
He already tagged you!

624
00:46:13,096 --> 00:46:15,387
No, you already tagged him out!

625
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:19,549
[Big-nose unexpectedly goes into
the mission early.]

626
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,713
I have no endurance.

627
00:46:21,714 --> 00:46:24,555
[Useless endurance which
goes against his speed.]

628
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:28,930
[Team SJ's Captain Big-nose is
fired up with the determination to win.]

629
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:32,117
- I can't help but run around it!
- We've only done 30 rounds so far.

630
00:46:33,813 --> 00:46:38,320
[Already onto their third player-
Should have at least 50 done already...]

631
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:40,364
Why are you guys just standing there talking
instead of cheering me on?

632
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,448
Go!

633
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:53,257
[Big-nose forcefully tags So Yeon in
regardless of the fact that she's a woman.]

634
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:56,087
- 36.
- How can we only have 36?

635
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:57,920
[Only 36 rounds between three men...]

636
00:46:57,921 --> 00:47:00,883
- How many do I have to do?
- You just need to do 50.

637
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:05,304
- The vein on your forehead is popping out.
- Really?

638
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:07,820
Don't worry, you still look very pretty.
Just think back to your school athletic days.

639
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:10,188
- What was your specialty?
- Long distance jumping.

640
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:13,804
She used to come in at first place
in all her regional school competitions.

641
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:16,004
She used to be a long distance jumper?

642
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,474
- She's the ace on our team!
- She is an ace.

643
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:21,702
[Team SJ's Ace So Yeon.]

644
00:47:23,484 --> 00:47:25,875
Lee So Yeon!
Run!

645
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:31,010
<i>What fun would this world be
without So Yeon in it?</i>

646
00:47:31,546 --> 00:47:33,357
[So Yeon's own army of admirers?]

647
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:39,345
<i>So Yeon is the best!
No, no, Ji Hyo's the best!</i>

648
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,495
- Is that not right?
- No, that's not right to say.

649
00:47:44,649 --> 00:47:47,467
[Already onto the 50th slide.]

650
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,447
Do at least ten more.

651
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:55,192
[So Yeon round and round all by herself...]

652
00:47:56,675 --> 00:48:00,301
- She's done 18 on her own already.
- She's already completed her 18th round.

653
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:02,855
[What a sad group of men...]

654
00:48:02,856 --> 00:48:05,544
- Lee So Yeon is the best!
- Can I stop now?

655
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:07,553
No, you can't stop.
Get at least two more.

656
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:10,550
I'm sorry, but we've only got
two more players left.

657
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:13,178
No, he's just lying.
He's not sorry in the least.

658
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:17,961
- The count is up to 55.
- Three more! Let's just get three more.

659
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,610
[Thanks to her good for nothing teammates,
she's getting her fill of the slide.]

660
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,266
Why are you being so inconsiderate
to So Yeon?

661
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:30,518
Would you rather do one more,
or go out on a date with me?

662
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,698
[What?]

663
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,596
[His proposal is enough to give her
another burst of energy down the slide.]

664
00:48:38,597 --> 00:48:40,858
I have yet to see her move that fast.

665
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:44,629
[So Yeon completes 22 rounds-
More than even Mr. Capable!]

666
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,512
[Hot pants man is on the move!]

667
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:50,600
Hot pants Soo Hong.

668
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:59,380
He's so slow.
He's slow and just pathetic.

669
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:06,275
[But all of Team SJ's attention is on
their Ace So Yeon.]

670
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,120
80.
You've completed 80 laps.

671
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:12,764
[After 80 laps are complete,
last runner, Jae Dong, is tagged in.]

672
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,411
- You're doing great.
- You really are taking your time.

673
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,529
- Pick up your speed.
- Why are you so slow?

674
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,079
You look like you're done with it already.

675
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,999
Close your mouth when
you slide down, Jae Dong.

676
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:31,764
Stop trying to look cute,
and just concentrate on moving faster.

677
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,959
- We have to win today!
- Tell Suk Jin to be quiet.

678
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:47,087
- We've only got four left to go.
- You can do this, Jae Dong.

679
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:49,001
[Almost at the finishing lien!]

680
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:54,491
We are almost at the finish line!
Hurry up and pick up your speed.

681
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:59,291
[A closer competition than expected.]

682
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:01,846
- Come on, cheer him on!
- I'll buy you a cup of coffee!

683
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:05,363
[Suddenly fired up down to the core!]

684
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,241
Only three more left to go, right?

685
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:12,480
[He even throws the glasses off of his face!]

686
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:17,915
<i>This looks like it may be the end...</i>

687
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:21,283
[One final lap left to go!]

688
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:30,319
[Team SJ completes 100 laps!]

689
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,566
Just tell us if we won or not.

690
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:34,732
I don't care if you have to make some edits,
but can you just tell us that we won?

691
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:38,669
[Please...]

692
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,204
I'm down here.

693
00:50:43,994 --> 00:50:48,110
[This man is left abandoned as soon as
the mission is over.]

694
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,824
I will start off by revealing
Team SJ's record.

695
00:50:50,825 --> 00:50:53,972
[Team SJ's record to be revealed first.]

696
00:50:53,973 --> 00:50:58,560
Your record is... 15 minutes and 23 seconds.

697
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:01,998
- We've been doing this for 15 minutes?
- You filmed this for 15 whole minutes?

698
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:05,737
- Running Man really is something else.
- Can you speed up my process then?

699
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:08,084
We've just been used.

700
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:11,110
If you don't play out the whole thing,
then I'm going to sue you guys.

701
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:16,738
[Wanting to relay to the viewers just
how hard they've worked and sweated.]

702
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,619
Do you think that you should maybe
edit my portion of it?

703
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,120
- He really is something.
- Make sure that my legs are showcased.

704
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:26,800
[Time to reveal Team RM's record.]

705
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:30,713
[In the 15 minute mark just like Team SJ.]

706
00:51:31,768 --> 00:51:34,441
15 minutes and 12 seconds.

707
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:39,013
[Team RM wins with only
a ten second difference!]

708
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,976
This is all because of you guys!

709
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,267
- You guys didn't even do anything!
- Do you think that we can win today?

710
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:50,709
[The glasses he threw off are now broken...]

711
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,390
Can you do something about the 11 seconds?
This is what those 11 seconds did.

712
00:51:58,604 --> 00:52:01,494
- How did that happen?
- While coming down the slide.

713
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:04,214
It's because we were doing
what you told us to do.

714
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:09,036
[Doing everything they can to help
Big-nose win today's race.]

715
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:12,949
- We're not asking you to fake anything.
- We're just asking for 11 seconds.

716
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,284
It's just one game.
You can beat them at the next game.

717
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:19,275
[There are more games to be played!
Best out of three for playground mission.]

718
00:52:19,276 --> 00:52:21,421
Let's win the next one.
Stop begging.

719
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:25,889
I'll just go to a nearby optometrist.
Forget this.

720
00:52:27,163 --> 00:52:30,813
- I'm not even going to watch this episode.
- Please edit it so I look good.

721
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:37,422
- Where did you throw it?
- Did you just randomly throw it off?

722
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:40,819
[Time to look for Jae Dong's glasses.]

723
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,857
- I think it's around here somewhere.
- You should carry around a spare pair.

724
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:46,153
Looking for these glasses is
like a challenge on its own.

725
00:52:47,284 --> 00:52:51,894
But... this isn't a joke,
but this is actually really touching.

726
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:55,204
I think I'm about to start tearing up.

727
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,373
Look at how beautiful this sight is.

728
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:01,425
[A beautiful sight to help ease
his earlier sense of loneliness.]

729
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,109
- How about we stop? This is exhausting.
- Yes, we've definitely played our part!

730
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,503
One, two, three.
Slate!

731
00:53:08,504 --> 00:53:11,380
[This touching moment is now over
with the snap of the slate.]

732
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,297
[Next game- Score 100 points with Gong-gi.]

733
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:22,805
Your next mission is, gong-gi.

734
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:25,262
This is another mission which is
related to the number, 100.

735
00:53:25,263 --> 00:53:28,643
All six members will each take turns
like you just did

736
00:53:28,644 --> 00:53:31,483
and catch the gong-gi pieces
to score 100 points.

737
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:33,288
If you either miss catching the piece

738
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:37,349
or drop the piece,
then it's onto the next player.

739
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,962
[Miss catching the piece,
then it's onto the next player.]

740
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:44,038
If both teams succeed the mission,
then the team with the fastest time wins.

741
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:46,783
But if we fail, then we automatically lose?

742
00:53:46,784 --> 00:53:49,103
- Yes, that's correct.
- Okay, then I'm going to dump all the pieces.

743
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:51,757
[Team RM to take the first turn.]

744
00:53:51,758 --> 00:53:54,217
- Make sure you assume the correct position.
- Are there different colors?

745
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:57,061
Don't dump it while standing,
but lower your stance when you dump it.

746
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:59,815
How old were you when you first
started playing gong-gi?

747
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:02,335
What does that even matter?
This is just a scientific fact.

748
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:05,448
Just lower your stance
because that'll be better when dumping it.

749
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,321
Stop doing that!

750
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:11,791
- Why are you even doing that?
- How does it feel to be scolded by him?

751
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,673
How does it feel to be scolded
by someone younger than you?

752
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,697
[Older Hyuk is used to having to listen
to his young brother.]

753
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:22,559
- Yes, that's good.
- You have to toss them around like this.

754
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,794
- Wow!
- Wow, that was a total failure.

755
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,264
What the heck is this?

756
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,826
This is like an amateur pocket ball player.

757
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:33,048
[Acting like a pocket ball newbie.]

758
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,686
- No, you can't do that.
- What the heck is this!

759
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:44,546
[Gong-gi scheming duo.]

760
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,700
You guys are such dirty players.

761
00:54:48,297 --> 00:54:51,140
- What are you guys doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

762
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:54,238
- Can you pass that over to me?
- Maybe they're trying to help us out.

763
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,539
[Courteous enough to stack the five pieces
together to help them grab better.]

764
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,589
- Then should we just go down the line?
- Yes.

765
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,727
That's probably better, right?
Okay, then I'm going to get started.

766
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,197
[Team RM's Yoo Hyuk takes the first turn.]

767
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:08,129
If you do it like that, then you're
going to lose your sense of balance.

768
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:12,082
- Don't lean off to the side.
- I'll just do it while sitting down.

769
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,038
Okay, you're doing great.

770
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:17,203
- Why are you blocking me from the camera?
- Sorry.

771
00:55:17,204 --> 00:55:20,208
This is just the way I like to sit.

772
00:55:23,748 --> 00:55:26,300
- You can do it one at a time too.
- Move it over to the other hand!

773
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,315
- You're taking a lot of time.
- Do you always get scolded by him like that?

774
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:33,650
It's okay.
It's because we're really close.

775
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:39,100
Good, you're doing really great.

776
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:43,613
[Very steady hand movements.]

777
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:47,410
- Yes, you're doing great!
- You really are doing really great.

778
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:50,222
- You're doing so well!
- Drop it.

779
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,500
- Let's move out of his way.
- Grab that group of three stones.

780
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:58,098
[Successfully grabs three all at once!]

781
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:01,621
[But...]

782
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:06,454
[He unexpectedly ousts himself
while moving over the gong-gi pieces.]

783
00:56:07,174 --> 00:56:10,565
Then is his turn over?
Are you serious?

784
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:12,458
[16 pieces and the time keeps on ticking...]

785
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:15,298
Get out of the way.

786
00:56:21,722 --> 00:56:25,194
[Jae Suk now gets spanked from
his older friends.]

787
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,017
[Kkuk is already onto his eighth piece.]

788
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,992
- Look at how he's catching his pieces.
- You are so dainty!

789
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:36,042
Have you been working out your arms
just so that you could do this?

790
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:38,289
We're on the same team!
Get your head on straight.

791
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:41,585
Yes, I forgot.
We are on the same team.

792
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,454
Catch both those pieces at the same time.

793
00:56:44,455 --> 00:56:47,118
[Already a huge mound of pieces in his hand.]

794
00:56:51,428 --> 00:56:54,296
No, you have to put that back down!

795
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:01,887
[Extremely sensitive down to the smallest
piece of gong-gi.]

796
00:57:01,888 --> 00:57:04,778
Wouldn't it be better for you to
sit down and do it, Ji Hyo?

797
00:57:05,883 --> 00:57:09,897
- Why did you go for such a huge piece?
- Because someone has to do it!

798
00:57:09,898 --> 00:57:12,458
- But you have smaller hands.
- Just be quiet!

799
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:13,961
[Blank Ji is the only member of the team
whom Mr. Capable will back down to.]

800
00:57:18,038 --> 00:57:21,116
[Blank Ji ousts herself while moving
the gong-gi piece.]

801
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:24,143
- Get out of the way.
- No, put that back down!

802
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,275
You have to put that back down!

803
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:30,278
That piece bounced out of my hand.

804
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,711
[Next player- Calm and peaceful Gary.]

805
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:35,513
- What is he doing right now?
- I have to move it over, don't I?

806
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:41,274
- Look at his eyes.
- My eyes are very blurry right now.

807
00:57:41,275 --> 00:57:43,571
[His eyes are blurring for some reason.]

808
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:49,664
[Wow, catches the difficult group of three.]

809
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:52,972
- I've got my focus now.
- How is he going to hold onto all that?

810
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:54,276
You're doing great.

811
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,477
- You're done. Put that back down.
- Fine, I got it!

812
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,627
How am I going to do this?

813
00:58:02,628 --> 00:58:05,068
You can do it.

814

Okay, fine!

818

he can even get started.]

819
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,680
This is absurd!
How can I do all this on my own?

820

[Remaining 29 pieces are all
on Kwang Soo's shoulders.]

821

These guys stacked up all these pieces.

822
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,917
You have to allow for us to move these.

823
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:44,216
Come on, just let Suk Jin win for once!

824
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:47,085
- Please, just let him win.
- I don't know how to reply to that.

825
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:49,129
If we can't do this,
then we have no chance of winning.

826
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,011
[A very pitiful man indeed...]

827
00:58:59,505 --> 00:59:01,235
Okay, your turn is now over.

828

[Fails to catch 100 pieces-
21 pieces still left to go.]

829
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:11,741
- What is this?
- He needs to drop them all at once!

830
00:59:11,742 --> 00:59:14,023
[It's like he's watering a plant garden.]

831
00:59:14,024 --> 00:59:16,357
Isn't he supposed to spread it out
all at once?

832
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:18,417
Come on, just let Suk Jin win.

833
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:22,469
- You can't play the game like this!
- Just let Suk Jin win.

834
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:26,173
[Even with all this scheming,
they've yet to win a game today.]

835
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:28,197
- Let him get another winning star.
- Do you think we can win this?

836
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,101
Even though we're all fighting,
it's still nice to be with others.

837
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:36,262
- Yes, it's very nice.
- No reason not to be happy.

838
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:46,232
[Hee Chul is out as soon as he starts.]

839

[How can this be?]

840
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:51,934
We have to win today!

841
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:54,970
[Hot pants lover is tagged in next.]

842
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:57,363
- What is his deal?
- Hey, take your time.

843
00:59:57,364 --> 01:00:00,201
- Hurry up!
- There's no reason to rush it.

844
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:02,898
There's no need to hurry.
Why are you in such a rush?

845
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,529
His stance right now is really
fitting with his hot pants right now.

846
01:00:06,463 --> 01:00:08,418
You're really good at gong-gi.

847
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:11,757
- I thought you were So Yeon for a second.
- You look so delicate right now.

848
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:17,028
[So Yeon's older sister?]

849
01:00:18,462 --> 01:00:20,483
Soo Hong, you should've been
born a woman.

850
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:23,300
Take your time.

851
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:25,301
Look at his mouth.
He keeps opening his mouth too.

852
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:33,337
[Just then...]

853
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:37,643
[But Soo Hong alone takes care of 24 pieces.]

854
01:00:37,644 --> 01:00:41,055
[So Yeon is up next.]

855
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:44,055
Is Soo Hong going again?

856
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:47,517
We're okay on time, so take it slow.

857
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:51,480
[Ace So Yeon is good
with even gong-gi playing.]

858
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,129
If you succeed,
then you win automatically.

859
01:00:56,179 --> 01:00:58,471
[A total of 36 pieces
including So Yeon's turn.]

860
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:00,928
[Now only three players left to go.]

861
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:04,757
[Just need to get over 79 pieces,
and they win regardless of the time.]

862
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,617
I think we'll be able to win this.

863
01:01:07,524 --> 01:01:11,554
[Has lost every game so far-
But isn't letting that stop him.]

864
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:14,392
One win every two years,
so that's two wins in every four years.

865
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,507
[That's sad...]

866
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,662
Yeah, that's like the World Cup.

867
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:25,986
[Along the same time frame as
the World cup and the Olympics.]

868
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:29,017
I know I shouldn't say this, but you shouldn't
have called us if you wanted to win.

869
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,444
I wish we could start over
from the farm field.

870
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:35,506
- I want to start over from the farm field.
- No, he should've called other people.

871
01:01:35,507 --> 01:01:37,961
I have to move over a little.

872
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:46,912
[He passes the danger...
but crumbles from the other hand.]

873
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:51,179
[38 pieces left out of a total of 100 pieces-
Jae Dong is tagged in for the win.]

874
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:56,978
- Okay, we'll let you keep that one.
- He caught it with his left hand.

875
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:01,999
- My glasses are broken, that's why.
- Don't use that as an excuse.

876
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,976
If you keep saying things like that,
then we have plenty of excuses of our own.

877
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:12,752
[Gets distracted by all the talking
and ends up dropping the piece.]

878
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:18,690
I want to forgo my turn.
I hate being pressured like this.

879
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:21,843
[Final player, Hee Suk,
doesn't like feeling pressured.]

880
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:25,719
- We're going to lose again.
- Those are really sexy socks.

881
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,738
Are those your wife's socks?

882
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:33,114
- Take your time.
- I feel like I'm going to start laughing.

our show three times a day.

a fervent fan of Running Man.]

885

Okay, good!
Don't drop it.

890
01:02:56,959 --> 01:03:00,202
- This is a very important role you have.
- Just don't drop it. Move it over.

891
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:03,200
Wait, aren't you older than him?

892
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:07,155
No, move it over to the other hand.

893
01:03:07,156 --> 01:03:10,638
It's weird hearing him talk to him like that.

894
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,777
Grab the smaller piece in front of you.

Hee Chul, you're the most important!

1133
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:38,492
- Go and try.
- Stand still.

1134
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:39,903
[Hee Suk and Hee Chul
are already eliminated.]

1135
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:42,497
- What do I do?
- We have to protect you.

1136
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,291
Wait.

1137
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,644
- An out.
- [Cat Ha Ha is ousted.]

1138
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:53,095
- Me too!
- [Rabbit Ji Hyo is ousted too.]

1139
01:16:53,095 --> 01:16:55,179
You're not going to protect him?

1140
01:16:56,418 --> 01:16:58,475
What is this?

1141
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:02,506
- I see him!
- I see him!

1142
01:17:02,506 --> 01:17:04,204
I see him.

1143
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:07,100
[Jae Suk Grasshopper is out!]

1144
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,978
- Jae Suk...
- I see him!

1145
01:17:10,887 --> 01:17:12,955
I see his head!
His head!

1146
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:20,507
Save me! Save me!

1147
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:23,139
[Gary Monkey is out!]

1148
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:27,301
[A tiger protecting the king
cannot be ousted.]

1149
01:17:27,301 --> 01:17:29,993
You're going to block this one, right?

1150
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:32,614
Jong Kook hasn't been eliminated yet.

1151
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,921
He's getting hit.

1152
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:36,725
Good good.

1153
01:17:38,726 --> 01:17:40,578
[Must hide!]

1154
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:42,941
Pass it around!

1155
01:17:45,113 --> 01:17:46,768
[The impala caught it with his face.]

1156
01:17:46,768 --> 01:17:48,311
Seriously!

1157
01:17:48,311 --> 01:17:52,201
[The impala is energetic to win.]

1158
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,064
I'm holding back!

1159
01:17:54,064 --> 01:17:56,751
I see Kwang Soo's head.
Stop any attacks from above.

1160
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:58,313
His head, his head, his head!

1161
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:03,029
[Attack Missed!]

1162
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:05,013
Good, good!

1163
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,508
- Isn't that So Yeon?
- [So Yeon chick out!]

1164
01:18:11,508 --> 01:18:13,106
I didn't know that you'd get hit!

1165
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,831
Okay, pass it.

1166
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:22,153
[The ball went beneath their legs]
[Soo Hong is in grave danger!]

1167
01:18:22,153 --> 01:18:23,968
All right.

1168
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:29,167
What the? How annoying!

1169
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,869
Seriously. You fox!

1170
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:36,134
Our king should run like this!
You keep doing this!

1171
01:18:36,134 --> 01:18:38,462
Do I have to?

1172
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,882
[The giraffe is stuck to
the tiger's back like glue.]

1173
01:18:48,882 --> 01:18:50,670
He's hesitating!

1174
01:18:51,911 --> 01:18:53,469
Center it!

1175
01:18:53,469 --> 01:18:55,709
How could the tiger be left
out of everyone?

1176
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:57,503
You have to pass it! Pass!

1177
01:18:57,503 --> 01:18:59,019
You have to keep passing it around.

1178
01:18:59,019 --> 01:19:01,773
Hey Gary. Good.

1179
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:06,564
[Soo Hong avoided it like a fox!]

1180
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:10,227
Pass it, pass it!

1181
01:19:10,716 --> 01:19:13,917
[Gae Monkey Showtime]

1182
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,674
This really makes you look like a fool
because you can't aim with your head.

1183
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,539
You have to catch it.

1184
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:22,406
Giraffe!

1185
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,935
[Within range]

1186
01:19:26,935 --> 01:19:32,323
[Moment of change]

1187
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:41,214
[Target hit]

1188
01:19:41,214 --> 01:19:43,574
- Hooray!
- Wow!

1189
01:19:43,574 --> 01:19:46,392
[Team SJ wins Target Dodgeball.]

1190
01:19:49,103 --> 01:19:50,783
[Kwang Soo, why did you do that?]

1191
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,955
Why would you go there?

1192
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,148
Did we win? Did we?

1193
01:19:55,148 --> 01:19:59,125
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you go over there?

1194
01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:02,417
I'm sorry.

1195
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:04,658
Why did you move?

1196
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:06,870
We can win today!

1197
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:09,162
This is a game we would
have definitely won!

1198
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,307
- Take your gold.
[Team SJ gets six gold bars]

1199
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:17,593
Gary should have caught it.

1200
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:20,784
This is the start of our win.
I think we're going to win.

1201
01:20:20,784 --> 01:20:22,774
Please count how much gold you have.

1202
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:24,868
I think we'll be about the same or lose.

1203
01:20:24,868 --> 01:20:27,757
[The team who has the most gold wins.]

1204
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:30,196
- What will be the last game?
- I'll announce the results.

1205
01:20:30,196 --> 01:20:37,563
Team RM has 13 gold bars,
and Team SJ has 14 gold bars.

1206
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:40,436
The final winning team is Team SJ.

1207
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:45,080
We won? Really?

1208
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,397
- This isn't it.
- Really?

1209
01:20:51,397 --> 01:20:53,698
The last game...

1210
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:58,957
Only the winning team, Team SJ,
can participate in the final mission.

1211
01:20:58,957 --> 01:21:01,065
- We can't participate?
- No, you can't.

1212
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,110
We only lost once!

1213
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,346
- It's because of Kwang Soo!
- Really?

1214
01:21:05,346 --> 01:21:07,831
It's the end for us?

1215
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:11,198
I only stayed like this
for the entire game!

1216
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:15,448
[The true winners are the ones
laughing in the end.]

1217
01:21:15,448 --> 01:21:17,409
We just lost once.

1218
01:21:17,409 --> 01:21:19,475
Big Nose! Big Nose!

1219
01:21:20,884 --> 01:21:23,668
- What happens now?
- This is what happens.

1220
01:21:23,668 --> 01:21:26,013
How could you do that? Giraffe?

1221
01:21:26,013 --> 01:21:27,893
Hurry and take them away!

1222
01:21:27,893 --> 01:21:31,174
[Guards to take them to the final mission.]

1223
01:21:31,174 --> 01:21:34,983
- What is this?
- What's going on?

1224
01:21:36,395 --> 01:21:38,592
We have to go somewhere?
[The guards are taking Team SJ somewhere.]

1225
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:41,345
- My hat.
- I didn't bring my bag.

1226
01:21:42,015 --> 01:21:44,458
Where are we going?

1227
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,447
- There's a reversal to this.
[What on earth is this?]

1228
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:50,677
Why does it feel like this
even though we won?

1229
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:53,749
- This isn't supposed to happen!
- We won!

1230
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,886
Where are we going?

1231
01:21:56,721 --> 01:21:58,422
You won't say.

1232
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:02,034
Where are you all going?
Where you taking them?

1233
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:04,410
- Hey!
- Why are you following him?

1234
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:08,034
Hey this is some kind of prison!

1235
01:22:08,034 --> 01:22:11,228
- What, what is this?
[You'll find out once you're there]

1236
01:22:11,228 --> 01:22:14,644
What are you doing? What?

1237
01:22:16,202 --> 01:22:20,295
I have to win today, though.
I don't know what's going on.

1238
01:22:22,425 --> 01:22:25,026
What is this?

1239
01:22:25,446 --> 01:22:28,035
There's a phone here too.

1240
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:30,343
[There's a pen here,
so maybe writing something?]

1241
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:34,661
What is this?

1242
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:40,291
[Team SJ have all been separated
into different rooms.]

1243
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:49,027
Your final mission is
a friendship telepathy test.

1244
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:53,306
- A friendship telepathy test.
- A friendship telepathy test.

1245
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:58,208
- A friendship telepathy test.
[Telepathy?]

1246
01:23:00,705 --> 01:23:05,834
Starting now, you'll choose either
gold or money and write it down.

1247
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:12,550
If your telepathy works and everyone
choose either gold or money

1248
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,741
we'll give you an enormous prize.

1249
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:18,056
If your telepathy doesn't work
and one person writes a different answer

1250
01:23:18,056 --> 01:23:21,379
You'll lose all of the gold
you've acquired.

1251
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:23,297
Even one person's answer
can't be different?

1252
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:29,161
- Wow.
- Wow.

1253
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:30,993
[The friends who spent a lot
of time together.]

1254
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,915
So it's six people who feel the same.

1255
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:39,328
Probability-wise, this is impossible.
How could six people say the same thing?

1256
01:23:40,219 --> 01:23:42,965
Then I have to think about
the other people right now.

1257
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,535
This is awful.

1258
01:23:46,918 --> 01:23:49,734
Wow, Running Man is awesome.

1259
01:23:51,325 --> 01:23:53,613
It'd be great if we could
all be the same.

1260
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,873
I made my decision.

1261
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:58,745
[Gold? Money?]

1262
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:01,939
Soo Hong would need cash
to hit the clubs...

1263
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:06,040
He can't go to the clubs
with gold. Isn't that right?

1264
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,273
My nickname is
'Shaman Nam Hee Suk.'

1265
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:11,162
Try searching 'Shaman Nam Hee Suk'
on the internet.

1266
01:24:11,162 --> 01:24:13,298
I'm positive.

1267
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,797
Two people will have a different answer.

1268
01:24:17,797 --> 01:24:20,750
We're six people, but four will have
the same answer, and two will be different.

1269
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:23,592
I'll send a wave.

1270
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,762
I'll change it.

1271
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:33,020
[An order through his nostrils.]

1272
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,548
[A charged telepathy.]
Let's do this.

1273
01:24:37,548 --> 01:24:41,211
- Let's do this!
[Everyone, do you hear my voice?]

1274
01:24:44,444 --> 01:24:48,887
[Big Nose's friends who
have to think of each other.]

1275
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:54,154
[Those who don't need a stare-off.]

1276
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:56,507
This is Kim Hee Chul.

1277
01:24:56,507 --> 01:25:00,141
[You know my heart... right?]

1278
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:03,675
- So Yeon, are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

1279
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:06,963
We're Big Nose's friends!

1280
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,437
[Has only won twice in 206 episodes.]

1281
01:25:11,437 --> 01:25:15,042
[We have to change that sorrow!]

1282
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:18,006
[Our only goal is to make sure
Big Nose wins.]

1283
01:25:19,886 --> 01:25:21,636
Let's make sure Suk Jin wins!

1284
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:24,132
Big Nose! Big Nose! Fighting!

1285
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:28,597
[If that sorrow disappears,
there's a huge prize at stake.]

1286
01:25:28,597 --> 01:25:32,233
[Telepathy over]

1287
01:25:32,233 --> 01:25:35,954
[Will they all have gotten
through to one another?]

1288
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:39,781
[Ta-da]

1289
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:47,070
[The final mission stage
to test their telepathy.]

1290
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:49,274
What is this? Wow.

1291
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,785
We really only lost once
and this is what happens?

1292
01:25:51,785 --> 01:25:54,744
- It's too much.
- Isn't that all in vain?

1293
01:25:56,885 --> 01:26:02,085
- JSJ was too much today.
- I think they're going to drop.

1294
01:26:02,085 --> 01:26:06,216
- I think this is good for us.
- Do they drop if they're wrong?

1295
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:11,031
As you know, Team SJ has won
in a reversal today.

1296
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:13,322
They only won once.

1297
01:26:13,322 --> 01:26:17,649
There is a chance for you
to take home the gold.

1298
01:26:17,649 --> 01:26:19,791
- What is this?
- Just wait and see.

1299
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:24,978
You see the final mission is
a friendship telepathy test.

1300
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:30,252
Everyone is in separate rooms
and they were given a choice.

1301
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:32,052
Is it gold or money?

1302
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:34,301
- Wow.
- Gold or money?

1303
01:26:34,301 --> 01:26:37,322
- We want to try it, too.
- Let's try it.

1304
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:39,776
- Gary stand over there.
- Gold stands, and money sits.

1305
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:42,994
One, two, three!

1306
01:26:42,994 --> 01:26:45,749
- Huh?
- Of course it's money!

1307
01:26:45,749 --> 01:26:47,966
- What are you going to do with money?
[Zero Telepathy]

1308
01:26:47,966 --> 01:26:49,762
You can't even exchange it.

1309
01:26:49,762 --> 01:26:52,600
If we're this bad, then that team
has no chance.

1310
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:56,047
He's coming. Suk Jin's coming.

1311
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:59,789
- Don't I look like a swimmer?
- Please go up!

1312
01:27:02,932 --> 01:27:06,853
Ah, this is a drop. How scary.

1313
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:11,170
His shorts really are too short.

1314
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:13,346
- Why are his clothes so short?
- Huh? Can't hear you.

1315
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:17,769
[Team SJ has written down
either gold or money]

1316
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:21,510
- What is this?
- You can't hear anything, right?

1317
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,731
This is what the winning team does?

1318
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:26,403
Jae Dong's coming. He's coming.

1319
01:27:26,796 --> 01:27:28,741
He's coming.

1320
01:27:28,741 --> 01:27:33,185
[What did Jae Dong choose
between gold and money?]

1321
01:27:33,185 --> 01:27:35,449
Come over here, Jae Dong.

1322
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:44,633
[He's still energetic.
Will he be in a bit...]

1323
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:47,853
Is this what it feels like
to see a celebrity on stage?

1324
01:27:49,184 --> 01:27:51,169
He looks really young.

1325
01:27:53,002 --> 01:27:56,507
[All of Team SJ is now on stage.]

1326
01:27:57,811 --> 01:27:59,684
- Take your headphones off!
- Take them off.

1327
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:03,289
Take them off.

1328
01:28:04,503 --> 01:28:06,677
I'm sure everyone wrote down
the same thing.

1329
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,539
It's a miracle if we get this.
A miracle.

1330
01:28:13,299 --> 01:28:18,456
Today's winning team is Team SJ.
Congratulations.

1331
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,106
Thanks, you guys!

1332
01:28:22,106 --> 01:28:25,366
Why do we have to be uneasy
and stand up here?

1333
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,181
Team SJ, who has received
14 gold bars.

1334
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:36,755
You must all have written the same answer
to acquire this prize.

1335
01:28:36,755 --> 01:28:38,849
That doesn't make any sense!
Do the majority!

1336
01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:46,765
If your telepathy works,
we'll give you double your winnings

1337
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:50,044
for a total of 28 gold bars.

1338
01:28:50,044 --> 01:28:51,751
- 28 gold bars?
- Really? Really?

1339
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:53,948
- That's awesome.
- We'll really give that to you.

1340
01:28:53,948 --> 01:28:55,609
I really need it.

1341
01:28:55,609 --> 01:28:58,826
Getting gold teeth for my wife
is very expensive...

1342
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:02,592
[A chance to melt gold bars
into gold teeth.]

1343
01:29:02,592 --> 01:29:06,297
However, if even one of you writes
a different answer and fails...

1344
01:29:07,515 --> 01:29:14,047
you'll fall into the pit, and we'll take
back the 14 gold bars

1345
01:29:14,047 --> 01:29:16,444
and give them to Team RM.

1346
01:29:16,444 --> 01:29:19,446
- Hooray!
- What's the meaning of that?

1347
01:29:19,446 --> 01:29:22,460
You can't do that!

1348
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:29,019
We'll test everyone's telepathy results
one by one.

1349
01:29:29,019 --> 01:29:31,294
- What is this?
- That isn't fair!

1350
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:34,494
It's double the gold though!

1351
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:37,930
- This isn't easy.
- I feel like I'm being punished.

1352
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:40,532
You planned for this!

1353
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:43,601
But I'm trusting you guys!
Let's go!

1354
01:29:44,553 --> 01:29:46,537
- We'll proceed.
- This won't work.

1355
01:29:46,537 --> 01:29:52,961
Starting with Suk Jin, please open
what you've written on your chest.

1356
01:29:52,961 --> 01:29:55,406
But none of you can see.

1357
01:29:55,406 --> 01:29:59,786
You cannot see. Even with one answer
the platform will drop.

1358
01:29:59,786 --> 01:30:01,500
Really?

1359
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,681
We're of one heart!
One heart!

1360
01:30:06,253 --> 01:30:09,277
[They'll stay in these seats
if their telepathy works.]

1361
01:30:09,277 --> 01:30:11,967
We'll take a look one at a time
starting with Ji Suk Jin.

1362
01:30:11,967 --> 01:30:15,418
One, two, three!

1363
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:18,533
[Gold or Money]

1364
01:30:18,533 --> 01:30:21,853
[Big Nose chose Gold]

1365
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:26,832
- You can't see.
- Don't look.

1366
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:30,120
[If the rest of Team SJ chooses gold
then they get double the gold.]

1367
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,563
- Next.
- Then we can drop here, too?

1368
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:37,691
- Wait!
- If Soo Hong wrote a different answer...

1369
01:30:37,691 --> 01:30:39,849
Then all of them will drop.

1370
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:42,209
- This is my style.
- SBS, really.

1371
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:45,022
One, two, three!

1372
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:46,713
Suk Jin!

1373
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:49,400
Suk Jin, it was this, right?

1374
01:30:50,322 --> 01:30:57,029
[Will Suk Jin's Gold telepathy
have worked?]

1375
01:30:57,029 --> 01:30:59,480
It was this, right?

1376
01:31:01,273 --> 01:31:04,944
[Gold]
[The Gold telepathy worked!]

1377
01:31:04,944 --> 01:31:07,427
[They didn't fall!]

1378
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:11,984
It's okay! It's okay!

1379
01:31:16,741 --> 01:31:19,024
I can't do this!

1380
01:31:19,024 --> 01:31:21,687
I'll give up! I'll give up!

1381
01:31:21,687 --> 01:31:24,293
I'll give up! Seriously!

1382
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:26,921
Nam Hee Suk remain standing.

1383
01:31:26,921 --> 01:31:29,604
Just take it, you guys.

1384
01:31:29,604 --> 01:31:31,798
You must remain standing.
Next!

1385
01:31:31,798 --> 01:31:36,097
- Jae Dong!
- One, two, three!

1386
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:38,796
One, two, three!

1387
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:47,983
[Save us...]

1388
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:51,098
Three!

1389
01:31:52,668 --> 01:32:01,665
[Telepathy... worked!]
[Gold]

1390
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:07,537
[Gold]
[They didn't fall!]

1391
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,736
- It was right!
[Feels good]

1392
01:32:15,093 --> 01:32:16,973
[Three out of six people's
telepathy worked.]

1393
01:32:19,052 --> 01:32:21,023
- It was right!
- It's right!

1394
01:32:21,023 --> 01:32:23,255
Give me an okay sign.

1395
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:29,841
Let's go, Hee Chul!

1396
01:32:30,263 --> 01:32:32,664
[Hee Chul's shoulders
are getting heavier.]

1397
01:32:32,664 --> 01:32:36,598
I'm the leading role
of today's victory, everyone!

1398
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:38,928
Victory Icon, Kim Hee Chul!

1399
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,858
[Will he really be the Victory Icon...]

1400
01:32:44,762 --> 01:32:47,551
[Will that faith block their ousting...]

1401
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:50,918
Keep showing them.
Keep showing them.

1402
01:32:50,918 --> 01:32:53,077
- Let's go!
- One, two, three!

1403
01:32:53,077 --> 01:32:56,346
Victory!

1404
01:32:56,346 --> 01:32:59,452

[Gold]

1406
01:33:04,603 --> 01:33:06,318
[They didn't fall!]

1407
01:33:06,318 --> 01:33:09,547
[We can do it!]

1408
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,430
How awesome.

1409
01:33:14,424 --> 01:33:16,960
[Bending down for the third time.]

1410
01:33:19,888 --> 01:33:22,026
[Legs are shaking]

1411
01:33:25,748 --> 01:33:28,333
- What's going on?
- This is really hard.

1412
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:30,310
[Has the Gold telepathy
really worked...]

1413
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,766
[Is this impossible task really
possible for these friends?]

1414
01:33:35,933 --> 01:33:38,423
- Hee Suk!
- Two left!

1415
01:33:38,423 --> 01:33:43,100
- Hee Suk please!
- One, two...

1416
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,239
I'm trusting you!

1417
01:33:45,623 --> 01:33:48,331
- I trust you, Hee Suk!
- Please!

1418
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:52,449
[What answer will the trusting
Hee Suk have?]

1419
01:33:52,449 --> 01:33:56,503
[Gold or Money]

1420
01:33:56,985 --> 01:34:00,354
[You must work, telepathy!]

1421
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:06,812
[We're dreaming of 28 gold bars!]

1422
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,060
[This is right, right?]

1423
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,080
[Telepathy...]

1424
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,258
[Money]

1425
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,503
[Drop]

1426
01:34:29,503 --> 01:34:32,127
[Skydiving from the stage]

1427
01:34:35,677 --> 01:34:38,033
I knew Hee Suk would write
down 'Money'!

1428
01:34:38,033 --> 01:34:43,112
[They watch the other team drop
and are happy to get gold.]

1429
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,947
[They drop into a plastic ball pit]

1430
01:34:49,556 --> 01:34:52,302
Hey you idiot!

1431
01:34:55,326 --> 01:34:57,827
Hey, you idiot! Hey!

1432
01:34:57,827 --> 01:35:00,508
- Hey!
- You wrote down gold?

1433
01:35:00,508 --> 01:35:02,816
We ran around getting gold until now!

1434
01:35:02,816 --> 01:35:04,937
It was me? Me?

1435
01:35:06,255 --> 01:35:08,760
[They've won but this feeling
isn't great.]

1436
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,049
- How could you have done that?
- That was you?

1437
01:35:12,564 --> 01:35:14,384
How frustrating.

1438
01:35:14,384 --> 01:35:17,334
[A gold smell all around outside.]

1439
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:19,530
I knew that 'Gold' would come up.

1440
01:35:21,746 --> 01:35:24,608
- This is what you call a reversal.
- This is thrilling.

1441
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:27,983
How thrilling!

1442
01:35:27,983 --> 01:35:29,822
It's amazing that they got that far.

1443
01:35:29,822 --> 01:35:35,088
Hey, one of those two were me.
I was part of my own prediction.

1444
01:35:35,088 --> 01:35:40,270
We spent all day hunting for gold!
Why would you write down 'Money'?

1445
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:42,265
Do you have any loyalty?

1446
01:35:42,265 --> 01:35:44,536
- What did you write?
- 'Money.'

1447
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:49,158
- Why did you?
- I thought that all of you would write that.

1448
01:35:50,694 --> 01:35:52,814
We really hate money!

1449
01:35:54,781 --> 01:35:58,928
For So Yeon, this isn't 'Money'
but 'Good.'

1450
01:36:01,168 --> 01:36:04,073
- It's good.
- She wrote it down wrong.

1451
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:06,300
Good, I wrote it down wrong.
Running Man is really 'Good'.

1452
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,938
With that, our team wins 14 gold bars.

1453
01:36:12,938 --> 01:36:16,468
That could have been ours!

1454
01:36:16,468 --> 01:36:19,727
Of course it's gold!

1455
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:25,099
We may have gotten the gold,
but the victory...

1456
01:36:26,407 --> 01:36:31,350
- is Team SJ!
[A gold-less win]

1457
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:33,506
Why did we win?

1458
01:36:33,506 --> 01:36:36,543
Why couldn't we have won?

1459
01:36:36,543 --> 01:36:39,531
[Dejected and in vain]

1460
01:36:40,748 --> 01:36:45,960
We won 14, but we have two
left over because we're six people.

1461
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,252
Share this among your team.

1462
01:36:50,484 --> 01:36:52,934
I can take it, right?

1463
01:36:57,992 --> 01:37:01,847
[Gold over Friends]

1464
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,575
- Suk Jin, you're the best.
- Take them.

1465
01:37:06,575 --> 01:37:10,420
In any case, we're adding one more
victory star for Suk Jin.

1466
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,074
Congratulations Team SJ!

1467
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:15,679

a third win!]
