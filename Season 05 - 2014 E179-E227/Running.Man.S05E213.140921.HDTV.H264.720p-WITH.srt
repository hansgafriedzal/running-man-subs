168
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,875
I didn't even know what was going on
as she just started insulting me.

169
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,099
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Please take good care of me.

170
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,039
- Would you like to try that again?
- No, thank you. I've got water in my ear.

171
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,357
What is this?
What do you mean, 'cut'?

172
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,559
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin's scene
also comes to an end.]

173
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,262
You have to give me a chance
to get my own revenge!

174
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,078
What revenge?
We're a couple.

175
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,436
I chose you as my partner.

176
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,913
[Really? I didn't know that.]

177
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,869
How does it feel to be beat down by
the woman who chose you?

178
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:55,746
You must work out a lot. I haven't
been hit this hard in a long time.

179
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,829
- He's sweating!
- Not since junior high.

180
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,364
- Why were you acting like that?
- It was a line from one of my dramas.

181
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:06,459
- It was just a parody of my drama.
- So this was all just a part of the plan?

182
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,588
The slap wasn't a part of the original plan,
but I just got a little carried away.

183
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,125
Seriously!

184
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,002
[Falling in perfect sync with Jae Suk.]

185
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,237
- It's very nice to meet you.
- They told me to hit you as hard as I could.

186
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:24,391
Yes, you did the right thing.
I usually don't feel it when I get hit.

187
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,843
You really do need to hit me hard.
You really are an actress.

188
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:31,835
[Hand in hand,
they're off to their next location.]

189
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,808
Her hand is so tiny.

190
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,357
[A rare look at Kkuk's bashful side.]

191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,341
She just barged into the room and told me
that she's now Min So Hee with her mole.

192
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:47,321
At least you were taken
off guard by someone you know.

193
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:49,521
This was my first time meeting her.

194
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:53,144
- Did you all get hit?
- Yes, and Gary had water dumped on him.

195
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,360
- You had water dumped on you?
- My partner knocked bottles off the table!

196
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:02,966
All our guests are known for their realistic
portrayal of strong and evil roles.

197
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,833
But all their styles are a bit different
from one another.

198
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,250
In Young is the aggressive type who
can overwhelm her opponents.

199
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,895
Yeo Jin is the type with a very strong
sense of self-esteem and pride.

200
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,674
And in Yoo Ri's case, she's just
a very destructive type.

201
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,862
With Ji Hyo, she's the type to just
beat her opponents down to the ground.

202
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,655
[Ji Hyo is the fighter.]

203
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:27,564
I know that they play these evil roles,
but look at the lovely smiles on their faces.

204
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:30,166
- They're all so sweet looking.
- I'm sure they're not like that in real life.

205
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,882
- Of course not.
- We're all very delicate and gentle.

206
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,883
Yes, we know that.

207
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:39,223
Today's race is...
'Find the Male Heir.'

208
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:41,750
- Male heir?
- Although you are not aware of this...

209
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,734
Amongst the six male
Running Man members...

210
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:47,275
there exists second generation heir
to a huge fortune.

211
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:51,161
[A second generation heir amongst
the six male Running Man members.]

212
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:54,524
How does it feel to be filming
in my hotel?

213
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,223
[Identity of the heir is found
within two seconds.]

214
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,971
- Does anyone need anything?
- Take whatever you'd like from here.

215
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,075
- Everything in here belongs to me.
- What are you talking about?

216
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:09,051
[Both are trying to proclaim
that they are the heir.]

217
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,563
- That thing cost me about 38 million Won.
- Just go change your clothes.

218
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,204
[Too embarrassing of a scene to
play out while in their sweatpants.]

219
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,741
- This is a designer brand.
- What are you talking about?

220
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,851
You will have to collect the hints needed to
find the identity of the heir during the race.

221
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:29,966
The couple who stands on the platform with
whom they think is the heir wins the race.

222
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,995
No one has any clues to
the real identity of the heir yet

223
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,838
and for the first through third place
winners of the games

224
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,614
a hint will be given out.
But only to the women.

225
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,593
[Only the women placing first through
third place will be given hints.]

226
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:47,267
Then it's possible that the women may not
tell us the hint and decide to go at it alone.

227
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,632
- They can do it by themselves.
- So it's their decision?

228
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,029
- That's correct.
- I have a good feeling about this.

229
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,202
Suk Jin is standing there like
he is the star of this show.

230
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,605
[Full of high hopes.]

231
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:02,251
One of us is the heir, right?
Who else could be it be but me?

232
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:05,083
But you're too old to
be the second generation heir.

233
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,919
[Looks more fitting
to be the first generation.]

234
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:14,230
[Is Big-nose the newest wave of
senior citizen looking second generation?]

235
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,156
The first hint will be given out to the first
three couples that arrive at the next location.

236
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,078
- Okay, I understand.
- You should get going.

237
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,069
Let's get going!

238
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,148
[Off to the first mission location!]

239
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,485
[Mud Battle of Evil queens and Heirs.]

240
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,138
[Their battle is fiercer than
the fiercest drama.]

241
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:38,084
[Fierce roses- Find the mysterious heir.]

242
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,923
- Let's go, Seo Woo. Come on.
- Okay.

243
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:51,268
[Hint given out to the first three couples
that arrives at the mission location.]

244
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:57,305
[Three couples in the same sector
of the revolving door.]

245
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,022
[Each couple is given
their own car to travel in.]

246
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,655
Seriously.

247
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,838
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yes, of course.

248
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,549
- Get going!
- I have to put my seatbelt on first.

249
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,703
[Jong Kook and Min Seo are
first to get on the road.]

250
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:18,897
We're in the lead, right?
I like that.

251
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,273
Yoo Ri, are you a competitive person?

252
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:24,826
- I'm pretty strong.
- You're strong?

253
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,962
- I want to win.
- You want to win?

254
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,900
[Yoo Ri shows off her competitive streak.]

255
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:33,399
- I don't look mean in person, do I?
- No, not at all.

256
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,492
Once my makeup comes off later,
I'm going to look even sweeter.

257
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,486
- My pants are more like a swimsuit.
- Yes, they look like a swimsuit.

258
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,229
Right? I wonder why I
was given a swimsuit to wear?

259
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,543
Water, farm field, or a muddy shore.

260
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:52,122
- One of those three, right?
- One of those three.

261
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,968
- You're leaking gas!
- Where?

262
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,903
- What? She needs to get gas?
- What is she saying?

263
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:06,110
- I like the way you work.
- I really thought they were leaking gas.

264
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:10,325
Really? Something was leaking?
I wonder if it's their air conditioner.

265
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,947
[Mistaken air conditioner drippings
for a gas leak.]

266
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:15,398
She's so nice to have let us know
where to go, right?

267
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,053
She wasn't giving us directions.
She lied and told us our gas was leaking.

268
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,340
Why are you so naive?

269
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,191
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin
arrive at the mission location.]

270
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:31,721
[Jong Kook and Min Seo beat them
there by the split of a hair.]

271
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,011
You must run over and grab a flag.

272
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,299
- Hurry, Kwang Soo!
- Where?

273
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:39,704
[Jong Kook and Min Seo are in the lead.]

274
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,401
Your long legs aren't helping you at all!

275
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,507
[Run over and grab the flag!]

276
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,111
Run!

277
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,429
[Jae Suk and Seo Woo arrive
in third place.]

278
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,799
We're late.
Run!

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,113
- It's only for the first three couples.
- What place are we in?

280
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,247
Yay, we're in first place.

281
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,094
[Jong Kook and Min Seo in first place.]

282
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,252
We're in second place.

283
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,572
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin in second place.]

284
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:08,286
How are you ever going to
run fast in those shoes?

285
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,520
[Jae Suk and Seo Woo in third place.]

286
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,728
How are you going to run
in those shoes?

287
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:19,657
Seriously! What were you thinking wearing
those shoes on Running Man?

288
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,252
That's because I'm really short.

289
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:25,950
- I didn't even know you were running.
- You're going to sprain your ankle.

290
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,643
[Her pride is more important
than a possible sprained ankle.]

291
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:32,204
- That's because I'm so short.
- This is so disappointing.

292
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,970
- Is it over already?
- She's so competitive!

293
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,893
[Gary and Yoo Ri arrive in fifth place.]

294
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:42,762
- I just don't want to come in at last place.
- Those aren't running shoes.

295
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,569
- What are you girls thinking?
- What kind of running shoes are those?

296
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,146
- They didn't even wear the right shoes.
- It's because my legs are too short.

297
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:52,891
She's blaming her legs.

298
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:57,312
Min Seo, is this the first time
you've ever been outside?

299
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,683
Your legs are way too white.

300
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:02,453
Is this the first time you've been
outside this year?

301
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:07,759
We welcome you to this
state of the art open space.

302
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,217
How is this space 'state of the art'?

303
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:13,370
We need everyone to take a look
at what's in front of you.

304
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:19,387
[Figurines of all the male
and female participants of the race.]

305
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:21,668
Is this supposed to be me?

306
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,612
- Why is Gary's figurine so handsome?
- Yes!

307
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:27,652
Gary, you look like an actor.

308
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,130
This one doesn't even look like me.

309
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:32,600
[Unlikely Ha Ha.]

310
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:36,178
Jong Kook's looks like he had a lot
of fat injected into his cheeks.

311
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:39,432
[Chubby Tiger.]

312
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:45,135
This is the current standing
of the couples.

313
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:49,866
Before we officially start the game,
to the first three couple to have arrived

314
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,840
a hint regarding the identity of the heir
will be given to the women only

315
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,155
as well as a chance card to
swap out their current partner.

316
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,275
Seo Woo, please step forward.

317
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:01,827
Watch out so you don't fall.

318
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:04,605
- What kind of shoes are those?
- Be careful not to fall over.

319
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:07,099
- Are those shoes for a store mannequin?
- I think we're of similar height.

320
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,785
What are you talking about?

321
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,109
Here, take a look.

322
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,893
I've never seen shoes like those
in the history of Running Man before.

323
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,634
A lot of people in Japan
wear those types of shoes.

324
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:17,478
- Make sure no one else sees, Seo Woo.
- I'm going to peek.

325
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,880
- I can see it.
- I just saw it.

326
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:23,408
My name is written on there,
isn't it?

327
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:29,146
[Hint- Resembles an animal.]

328
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:32,149
You can swap out one of the couples.

329
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,326
[An heir that resembles an animal.]

330
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,625
- I'm fine with my partner.
- You want to stay?

331
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,709
You can step back now that
you've made your decision.

332
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,618
- Second place winner, step forward.
- What happened? What's the hint?

333
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,860
- I don't think it's you.
- You don't think it's me?

334
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,308
I can see everything.

335
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,720
[A hint for the second
place winner, Yeo Jin.]

336
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,790
Why are you trying to be so secretive?

337
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,998
Yeo Jin is so tall.

338
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:58,032
[Hint number two-
Wants to be friends with idols.]

339
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,738
Why are you staring at me?

340
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,275
- Did you see my name?
- It's me, isn't it?

341
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,450
See? I knew it.
I knew it would be me.

342
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,095
Yoon Ah is standing so close to me.

343
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:11,083
<i>It's because she loves me!</i>

344
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,966
<i>Don't you know that you can't love her?</i>

345
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:19,708
[The heir has a special soft spot
for the idols?]

346
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,975
I think I know who it is.

347
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:30,808
[Takes Suk Jin's figurine and swaps
it out with Kwang Soo's figurine.]

348
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,944
- What are you doing?
- We can see what you're doing.

349
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:36,071
- We haven't even done anything yet!
- Please step back.

350
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:39,866
- He is the first one to get swapped out.
- Did you really swap me out?

351
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:43,667
First place winner, Kim Min Seo,
please step forward.

352
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:45,578
Please be careful so that
no one else can see it.

353
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:53,883
[Hint number three-
Has released a music album.]

354
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,250
[Several of these members have
released music albums in the past.]

355
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:03,690
[Her current partner is
singer Kim Jong Kook.]

356
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,559
I'm not going to switch.

357
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:13,448
[Why will they be coupled off by the time
the final mission rolls around?]

358
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:17,460
You will now enter the arena where
your first game will take place.

359
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,598
I will let you know what that is
once you've entered the arena.

360
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,568
I just saw it.
What is that?

361
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,766
- What is that?
- I just saw it.

362
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:30,566
- That's not going to be easy.
- I can hear the staff members snickering.

363
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,708
[This is where the first
competition will take place.]

364
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,128
I will now let you know
what your mission is going to be.

365
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,674
Since we have the hottest in-demand
actresses on as our guests

366
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:46,732
we have prepared a game which consists of
parodies of classic scenes from dramas.

367
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:50,844
- Okay.
- The first game is, 'The red earth's desire.'

368
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:54,762
We have prepared a pond of red clay
which you can see behind you.

369
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,039
The red clay is very good for your skin.

370
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,377
The women will climb up onto
the platform that you see behind you

371
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:02,738
and wait for their own partners.

372
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,978
The men will wait in standby in the pond

373
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,407
and run over to the platform and climb up
on it with the help of their partners

374
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,309
when the whistle sounds.

375
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,025
- I see.
- Simple, isn't it?

376
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:16,302
The game ends when there's only
one couple left standing on the platform.

377
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:19,161
- That sounds like fun.
- It may be fun for you!

378
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:23,313
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Pushing and shoving us around is fun?

379
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,204
- Yes, I bet he would have fun with it.
- I think the audience will like it.

380
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:29,155
Seo Woo can't even stand steady
in her shoes right now.

381
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:32,104
[The fact that she's still standing
is a miracle in itself.]

382
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,928
We have a comfortable pair
of shoes coming her way.

383
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,151
We will play a total of three rounds.

384
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:39,191
We need everyone to swap out
their shoes with each other.

385
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:44,375
- His shoes are way too big.
- I'm going to sprain my ankles in those.

386
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:48,415
No, these aren't very tall.
See?

387
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:51,551
They just look taller than they are.

388
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:53,586
There's no need to try to
look this good!

389
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:57,234
[They seem more worried about having
to say goodbye to their shoes.]

390
00:22:57,235 --> 00:23:01,962
I've never even imagined that we would
be coming to a place like this.

391
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,171
Seo Woo said that the shoes
she's wearing are her own shoes.

392
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:08,604
She says it's not her manager who
came with her here today

393
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,917
but it's a friend of hers
from her neighborhood.

394
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:15,006
- Why don't you change your shoes?
- Change your shoes and let's get started.

395
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:19,275
[Changing a pair of shoes seems to
be taking quite some time.]

396
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:20,959
Neither one of them want to
take off their shoes.

397
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,732
I can understand that.

398
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,512
Just let them wear the shoes they want.

399
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:28,442
Do you want me to line
the rubber boots with something?

400
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:31,311
[The two ladies finally steps down
from their tall shoes.]

401
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,467
[Putting each shoe on with care.]

402
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,819
[How many minutes does it take
to put on a pair of rubber boots?]

403
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:52,821
[At this rate, the sun will set before
they can even get started.]

404
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,184
- What's taking so long?
- Let's just start the game!

405
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:59,366
- I'm about to lose it.
- You ladies are so high maintenance.

406
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,990
Just how many Ji Suk Jin's are there?

407
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:07,223
My ribs are seriously hurting.

408
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:09,722
Did you poop before you
came this morning?

409
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:12,710
[This kiddo doesn't sugarcoat
anything just for women.]

410
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:17,946
I've noticed that all actresses look hunched
over when they're out of their heels.

411
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,292
Why do you women do that?

412
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,585
It's because we like being higher.

413
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,068
- Please get back on your higher ground.
- Why are you standing on a rock?

414
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,236
That's enough!

415
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:33,175
[The rock stands firm to protect
this actress' self-pride.]

416
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:37,522
- Seriously, just sit down.
- This is insane.

417
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:42,417
- Ji Hyo really is so cool.
- Sorry for everything, Ji Hyo.

418
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:45,566
- Ji Hyo, thanks for being so cool.
- We can't even get started with the game.

419
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,257
This makes me realize
just how cool Ji Hyo is.

420
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:55,996
[Within moments, Yoo Ri is
transformed into a walking giant.]

421
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:58,172
What are you doing!

422
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:00,526
Yoo Ri, come stand over here.

423
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:05,352
- Let's just film this squatting down.
- I've never seen anything like this.

424
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:10,452
- You have to hook it to your belt.
- Why is she wearing mismatched boots!

425
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:14,516
Why are you wearing mismatched boots?

426
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:19,374
- She has on two left boots.
- I'm not playing this game anymore!

427
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:21,965
She's wearing two left boots!

428
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,815
[Maybe she was too saddened by saying
goodbye to her shoes to have noticed...]

429
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,664
When are we ever going to
get this game started?

430
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,492
[At the end of a very long moment...]

431
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,704
[Everyone finally enters the field for
the game of 'The red earth's desire.']

432
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:35,660
- Can I get a towel?
- Are we playing the game or what?

433
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,932
She wants a towel!

434
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:41,467
[Give her a towel before the day is over!]

435
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,716
I'm starting to dislike all these women!

436
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,144
Ready!

437
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,892
I have a question.

438
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,954
[We're just going to
have to do this tomorrow.]

439
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:56,015
If one of us girls fall off the platform,
are we allowed to climb back up on it?

440
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,851
- Yes.
- Really?

441
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,425
Hey!
Isn't that obvious?

442
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:04,517
- Kiddo! You, come here.
- ready!

443
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:10,805
[The evil queen's challenge.]

444
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,238
- I'm coming for you.
- Ready, set...

445
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,756
[The red earth's desire- Start.]

446
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:19,516
How do I do this?
Do I push them off?

447
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:24,169
[Protect your own partner,
and push off the opposing teams!]

448
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,748
[Physical brawl begins.]

449
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:40,714
[Giraffe and Seo Woo simultaneously
get plunged into a clay bathtub.]

450
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:46,578
[Yoo Hyuk is cornered.]

451
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,689
[Min Seo shows her evil side.]

452
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:55,195
[These women are fearless in their
determination to protect their own men.]

453
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,119
You're not supposed to kick
with your foot!

454
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:12,341
[This little tomboy gets a clay shower
in her face from her partner.]

455
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:19,022
[Team Ha Ha and In Young are struggling
in front of Min Seo from the other team.]

456
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:22,778
I'm sorry!

457
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:26,841
[In Young ultimately ends up
getting a clay bath.]

458
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:30,294
[Evil Yoo Ri is out to hunt down the Tiger.]

459
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,205
[Strength!]

460
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:37,524
[Yoo Ri succeeds in eliminating the Tiger.]

461
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,307
[Throws people off the platform
with a smile on her face.]

462
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:48,688
[Hard-core evil queen.]

463
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,347
Here we go again!

464
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:57,344
Fine, let's see how far this goes!

465
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,417
[Red clay face wash of rage.]

466
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:05,396
[Yoo Hyuk heads back to the platform
after red clay face wash of rage.]

467
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:09,405
[In Young tries to pull
Yoo Hyuk off the platform.]

468
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,110
[I'm going to pull all of you down!]

469
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,327
Ugh, I'm so pissed!

470
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:27,617
[Heir candidate is thrown 2m into the air.]

471
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,396
[I'm coming for all of you.]

472
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,116
[Who even needs these shoes?]

473
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:39,528
[What is she trying to do
to the Giraffe?]

474
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:47,670
[She uses the Giraffe as her stepladder.]

475
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,716
[This tomboy uses whatever method
she can think of to get back up.]

476
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:56,612
[This man is used to getting used
by this group of evil queens.]

477
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:02,537
[But she's thrown back off
as soon as she's back on.]

478
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:07,198
[The only thing she can think of
is the Kwang Soo stepladder.]

479
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:10,386
[Giraffe stepladder is the best!]

480
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,163
[A bashful kiss with the muddy water.]

481
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,821
You should've clung onto me sooner!
Why are you clinging onto me now?

482
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:20,077
[Blank Ji's throat grabbing proposal.]

483
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,166
[Giraffe, the public stepladder.]

484
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:34,492
[Mr. Heir, where in the world are you?]

485
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,782
[This is evil queens' battlefield.]

486
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,338
[The game is called to a halt.]

487
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:48,072
Why do I have a woman's
strand of hair in my hand?

488
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:51,180
- What happened here?
- Jae Suk.

489
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:53,019
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

490
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,703
- There is no end.
- This is endless.

491
00:29:55,704 --> 00:30:00,143
- This is a total battlefield.
- Girls weren't going to push each other.

492
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:04,379
[Why make a promise you didn't
intend on keeping?]

493
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,972
Since I was unaware of how
ferocious you were going to get

494
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,055
- I'm going to have to modify the rules.
- Okay.

495
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,820
- You didn't realize it, did you?
- They are evil.

496
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,637
- They're too fierce!
- Yes, I agree.

497
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:15,092
Most women would quit by now,
so what's wrong with you women?

498
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:18,336
And they keep grabbing me in places
where they shouldn't be grabbing.

499
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,553
[Getting a true taste of their terror.]

500
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:25,690
Seo Woo first checked to see if
there were any cameras filming her

501
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,429
and then she cursed at me.

502
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,916
I heard that too! Seo Woo first asked
if there were any cameras around

503
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,444
- then she cursed out loud.
- She cursed right in my face.

504
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,972
- This is no joke.
- It was all just a facade.

505
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:38,917
[I will pay you back for this humiliation.]

506
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:44,604
You have 100 seconds on the clock.

507
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:48,349
Couples who are not standing on the platform
at the end of that time are then eliminated.

508
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,852
Ready!

509
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:56,201
[Red earth's desire- Start.]

510
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:00,766
[Using her gestured to attack.]

511
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:07,143
[Stepladder Giraffe jumps up
onto the platform.]

512
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,387
[A tug of war.]

513
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:15,951
[Giraffe's abdominals are exposed.]

514
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,988
Yoo Jae Suk.

515
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,272
[The two evil queens work together.]

516
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:33,050
[Tosses Yoo Hyuk off to the Giraffe.]

517
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,007
[Yoo Hyuk gets a good soak
in the muddy clay bath.]

518
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:43,693
[Everyone has a fierce look
on their faces.]

519
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,702
[Which of the couples will be eliminated
at the end of those 100 seconds?]

520
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,008
[The red clay couple.]

521
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:57,290
[Only ten seconds left on the clock.]

522
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:02,590
[Desperate attempts to get on
and remain on the platform.]

523
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,153
[Evil Yoo Ri's high kick.]

524
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:15,099
[100 seconds are up.]

525
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:22,213
[Big-nose and Yoo Hyuk are exhausted.]

526
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:26,654
[Evil queen's relaxed smile on her face.]

527
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:33,229
Yoo Jae Suk, Seo Woo and
Song Ji Hyo, Ji Suk Jin are eliminated.

528
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,188
Do you know how many times
Yoo Ri kicked me?

529
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,998
She kicked me in the face.

530
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,676
We didn't see that
so please step off to the side.

531
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,081
- Min Seo is no joke.
- No, she's not.

532
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:48,426
Min Seo with that sweet smile on her face...
she needs to be avoided.

533
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:49,789
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:54,025
No, you're not sorry!
You're all evil!

535
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,399
You're all evil!

536
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,907
The couple who raises their joined hands
together from the platform wins the game.

537
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:03,573
What are you doing?

538
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:05,614
Why are you holding
all that mud in your hands?

539
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,663
- Okay.
- They've all got some sort of a weapon.

540
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:11,237
In Young, just grab some small rocks.

541
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:14,348
Ready, get set... go!

542
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,677
What are you doing
with that mud in your hands?

543
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,522
[Throws the mud in her hands.]

544
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,826
[Yoo Ri launches into attack.]

545
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:28,761
[She just wants to give them a mud facial.]

546
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:31,739
- What are you doing!
- Why are you throwing poop at me!

547
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,677
[In Young tries to climb up the platform
with the help of Ha Ha.]

548
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:43,544
[Your shirt is my climbing rope.]

549
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:50,113
[All four couples are now
on top of the platform.]

550
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:54,064
[Each making their own individual effort to
deter each other from standing up.]

551
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,536
That Min Seo is no joke.

552
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,267
- There's only one minute left on the clock.
- What is the matter with her!

553
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:00,464
[Min Seo puts herself in charge
of eliminating the Giraffe.]

554
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:04,279
[She could be a judo player.]

555
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,961
[This is an absolute battlefield.]

556
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:16,727
These are my underwear!

557
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:19,793
[Could've been overexposure.]

558
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,590
You must've lost your mind!

559
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,668
[Ambush attack.]

560
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:30,860
[Giraffe diving show.]

561
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:34,713
Min Seo is no joke.
You have to watch out for her.

562
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,417
Climb up here, Kwang Soo!

563
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:39,134
[Eyeing for a chance to get back
up on the platform.]

564
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:41,825
[Speeds up...]

565
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:47,096
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin
win first place.]

566
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:51,350
[There's no time!]

567
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:59,220
[Jong Kook and Min Seo
in second place.]

568
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,977
You must feel out of place.

569
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,744
What is this girl's deal?

570
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:09,079
I saw her flying towards me,
so I just got out of her way.

571
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,823
- Yoo Ri's not smiling right now.
- Can we do it again?

572
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,728
Why?
Do you want to kill them all?

573
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:21,662
I need the winning couples to stand off
to the side with the rest of the members.

574
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,736
Third place winners, Yoo Ri and Gary.

575
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:29,438
- Yoo Ri, please step forward.
- Lee Yoo Ri is not your average woman.

576
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:31,224
Please stand behind the display.

577
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:34,739
Here's the third place hint.
Do not show it to anyone else.

578
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,081
Yoo Ri did a great job.

579
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:40,445
- She's seriously no joke.
- She's really strong.

580
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:46,564
[More than 170cm tall.]

581
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:49,575
[Is Ha Ha taller than 170cm?]

582
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:57,586
[Gary is her current partner.]

583
00:35:57,587 --> 00:36:00,575
- I heard all the ladies talking just now.
- I heard them talking too.

584
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:07,809
[Swaps Gary out for Jong Kook,
who is taller in stature.]

585
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,714
[Jong Kook, Yoo Ri and
Gary and Min Seo.]

586
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,728
- Second place winners.
- That's us.

587
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:19,938
- Kim Min Seo, please step forward.
- You did a great job.

588
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:21,135
[Min Seo's second hint and
second chance to swap out her partner.]

589
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:32,701
[Loves to play ddakji.]

590
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,350
[When it comes to playing ddakji...]

591
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:40,430
[Then could it mean that it must be
either Jae Suk or Jong Kook?]

592
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:45,208
[Or could it be the recently crowned
King of Ddakji, Big-nose?]

593
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,250
[Just could be the ddakji loving
second generation heir?]

594
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:55,432
You know something?
Seo Woo was the real evil one.

595
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:58,239
Do you know what she did when
the cameras weren't pointed her way?

596
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,255
But she kept acting even when the cameras
weren't around in attempt to deceive us.

597
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:02,852
[Swaps Gary and Jong Kook back
to their original spots.]

598
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,393
Just put me back where I belong.

599
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:07,999
I bet she's already moved Kwang Soo
away from her.

600
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,022
[Yeo Jin will now receive
the first place hint for winning.]

601
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:15,418
Do you want to get punched in
your appendix?

602
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,311
[Yeo Jin receives
the best hint out of them all.]

603
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:21,857
[What does Yeo Jin's hint say?]

604
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:27,010
[Using the hint to figure out
who the heir could be.]

605
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,146
I will continue to give it my best.

606
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:33,477
She's swapping it around a lot.

607
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:37,796
- I thought she was playing chess.
- What are you doing up there?

608
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,912
[Jong Kook, Ji Hyo and
Kwang Soo, Min Seo.]

609
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:40,918
- Do you dislike Kwang Soo that much?
- Can I make another switch?

610
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:42,524
No, you can only do it once.

611
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:45,484
[It is still unknown as to who will end up
whose partner in the final mission.]

612
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:48,148
We are all clear here,
and off to the next location!

613
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,846
[Immediately off to the next location.]

614
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,440
[Will it be advantageous to be
the first ones to arrive?]

615
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:57,024
[Sprinting towards their cars.]

616
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:03,268
[Tomboy Yoo Ri is in the lead.]

617
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:12,662
[Huh?
Where is Yoo Ri suddenly going?]

618
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,634
Why are you going over there?

619
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,739
[Could there be a shortcut?
The tomboy throws herself into the pond.]

620
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:27,093
[The tomboy Yoo Ri makes her own path.]

621
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,288
She could've just cut through here.

622
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:41,140
[Off to the next location.]

623
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:47,177
Do you like idols?

624
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:49,958
[Checking to see if Kwang Soo
could possibly be the heir.]

625
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,300
I'm not really a huge fan.

626
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:57,463
Who do you think is the most
loyal member out of them all?

627
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,376
Tell me who they are in order.

628
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:03,514
- Am I the heir?
- Why, are you loyal?

629
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:06,656
When it comes to loyalty...

630
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:08,826
- That could be me.
- Really?

631
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:11,789
[Does her hint have
something to do with being loyal?]

632
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:22,245
You totally dived in there
and you swam across the pond.

633
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:26,681
I thought that pond
was put there on purpose.

634
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:30,715
When I couldn't see the end of the road,
I thought we were meant to swim across it.

635
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:35,637
There are some teams who have yet
to receive any of their hints.

636
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:40,591
- Taller than 170cm?
- Yes, taller than 170cm.

637
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:42,736
[Yoo Ri's already shared
her hint with Gary.]

638
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:45,732
- That means... Ha Ha is eliminated.
- That's funny.

639
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:50,681
[170cm or taller...]

640
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:53,832
Please show a lot of love and support
for Running Man.

641
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:57,708
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing support for your show.

642
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,907
[This tomboy shows off her PR talent.]

643
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,398
- I actually do my own PR work.
- Seriously?

644
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,774
[Next mission location-
Cutting edge vacant carwash lot.]

645
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,161
[And a red sports car
in the middle of the field.]

646
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,767
[Ha Ha and In Young are the
first ones to arrive.]

647
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:22,874
- What is this now?
- There's no prize for having arrived early.

648
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:27,562
- You really are too much.
- You'll have the chance to get started first.

649
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:31,787
- This is really unfair.
- But you may be the first ones to finish.

650
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:35,701
Are you sure you don't want to give it to us?
She's changing right in front of our eyes.

651
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:39,520
Your expression really
doesn't look very good.

652
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:43,596
- This is a carwash?
- You guys are something else.

653
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,981
[What kind of a drama waits
for them here?]

654
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:52,217
- Really?
- You two are the same height.

655
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:59,024
[Automatic and instant growth spurt.]

656
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:01,334
What are you talking about?

657
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:04,543
[Invisible high heels keeps these girls'
self-pride afloat.]

658
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:08,852
In Young just confessed to me that
it wasn't her looks she used to be

659
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:10,618
famous for but for her fighting skills.

660
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:14,947
- She's very angry right now.
- Yes, her true self is shining through.

661
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:18,034
- She's changed after one game.
- The glint in her eye is different.

662
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:21,660
- I thought she was so sweet.
- Here is your second mission.

663
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:26,008
It's a game that's correlated to a
scene that's necessary in every drama.

664
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,121
Yes, and that's destruction of evidence.

665
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:30,355
[Second mission-
Destruction of evidence.]

666
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:35,444
[A scene that you see every evil queen
deals with in every drama.]

667
00:41:35,445 --> 00:41:38,355
[The obligatory destruction of
evidence scene.]

668
00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:43,108
You'll be given sheaves of paper with
your lines as well as a paper shredder.

669
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:47,959
- You know what a paper shredder is?
- Is that manual?

670
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,616
The couple taking the challenge
must act out a scene to earn time

671
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:57,592
and once the whistle sounds, the couple
must run over to the car and get in.

672
00:41:57,593 --> 00:42:03,414
Then they just need to shred the paper
evidence in the shredder once in the car.

673
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:06,115
If you fail to get rid of all the evidence
within the time limit

674
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,466
then the water from the carwash
will get dumped on you.

675
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:09,930
[Only 30 seconds to get rid of
all the paper evidence.]

676
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:13,777
- I have a slight hand tremor.
- What are you talking about?

677
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:16,141
These girls have every single condition.

678
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:20,082
- Okay, we'll get started.
- We're not ready yet.

679
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:23,262
[Practicing acting out their scene to
earn themselves some extra time.]

680
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:26,334
Why are there so many sheets?
It's not just one single sheet of paper?

681
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,583
- We'll now get started.
- The girls have to take off their hats.

682
00:42:29,584 --> 00:42:34,274
- This is unfair to the rest of us.
- Take off your hat, Seo Woo.

683
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:37,160
- It's okay.
- My hair gets way too curly when wet.

684
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,679
- Can't we get anything done around here?
- No, nothing.

685
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,443
- Hand tremors, and hair issues...
- My hair is totally curly!

686
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:53,131
- It's okay, it looks cute.
- It's pretty.

687
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:56,123
[It's okay, it's a beautiful head of curls.]

688
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:02,233
- This is after getting my hair straightened.
- It's okay, it's still pretty.

689
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,275
Her hair is naturally curly?

690
00:43:04,276 --> 00:43:06,927
She has so many different styles.

691
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,696
She's getting into her acting mode.

692
00:43:11,697 --> 00:43:14,877
What kind of a role is she playing?

693
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:18,267
- She's a servant maid.
- That's what she wants to play.

694
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,137
Why are you making her be a maid?

695
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:22,006
Are you trying to do a remake
of the movie?

696
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:24,024
That's what she wants to play.

697
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:27,773
I played the master in the movie,
but I want to play the maid right now.

698
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:38,107
[Seo Woo played the epitome of
an evil queen in the movie, 'Maid'.]

699
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:40,416
<i>I was being kind to you just now.</i>

700
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:49,007
[Can that brutal master be
reborn into a lowly servant?]

701
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:55,580
[Cleaning the mud off the muddy field-
An impossible task for the maid, Seo Woo.]

702
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,849
[Completely transforms herself as soon
as the word, 'standby', is heard.]

703
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,216
[Jae Suk and Seo Woo, take one.]

704
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:07,583
Look here.

705
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,074
Why are you doing this to me?

706
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:13,733
- You think being an heir is everything?
- No, that's not it.

707
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,127
Do you think that you can touch me
like this just because I'm your maid?

708
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,882
Why did you touch her?

709
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:22,868
[Very detailed acting.]

710
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,846
- You're an awful human being.
- I don't have a manager or any money.

711
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,634
- No, that's not it.
- I'm leaving.

712
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:31,869
- I'm leaving. Don't grab onto me!
- No, that's seriously not it.

713
00:44:34,937 --> 00:44:38,023
Don't touch me and don't come
to my room every single night.

714
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:42,521
- Why are you going to her room?
- You are an awful human being!

715
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:44,882
[What a despicable human being.]

716
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:48,504
- I said, don't do it!
- I've never gone to your room.

717
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:49,922
[Several consecutive face slapping.]

718
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:53,237
- Ugh, this is so maddening!
- Why did you go to her room?

719
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,097
You have extra ten seconds!

720
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:57,601
[Ten extra seconds to the given 30.
Jae Suk and Seo Woo have 40 seconds.]

721
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:07,039
You can't just shove it in there like that.

722
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,209
- You can't do it like that.
- Okay.

723
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,527
Those extra seconds aren't even
going to help them any.

724
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:16,784
- Ten extra second won't even help them any.
- Goodbye.

725
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:18,200
[Only the first sheet of paper.]

726
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,921
Hurry up.

727
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,688
[But these two rather seems to be
in perfect sync with one another.]

728
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:32,757
You can be my father-in-law.
'Please just stop it.'

729
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:36,461
She keeps calling me her father-in-law
whenever we try to practice.

730
00:45:36,898 --> 00:45:40,304
- We're just trying to come up with a plan.
- He's the worst nagger ever.

731
00:45:41,414 --> 00:45:44,376
[While the father-in-law is busy nagging,
these two are running out of time.]

732
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:56,015
- We're done with the paper shredding.
- Ugh, seriously!

733
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:58,521
- What?
- We're done with the paper shredding.

734
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,485
That's a lie.
She hid these under her seat.

735
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,217
- She's a liar.
- She's not a very nice woman.

736
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:12,336
- She's not very truthful.
- She really is an evil woman.

737
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,033
- Why are you hitting a woman?
- What are you thinking?

738
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:18,477
[Jae Suk is transformed into
a bad boy himself.]

739
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,207
Okay, time for the next couple.

740
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,230
[I wonder what kind of acting they'll do.]

741
00:46:28,896 --> 00:46:30,936
[Second couple- Ha Ha and In Young.]

742
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:33,243
Why is she getting so serious about it?

743
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:35,126
[Getting into the mode as
soon as they get started.]

744
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:39,681
- She's quite annoyed as is right now.
- Ready!

745
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,401
Standby, ready... cue!

746
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:49,843
Hey!

747
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:57,197
<i>I'm either going to kill that wench,
or kill myself!</i>

748
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:59,161
[The cold laser-like glares
beaming out of her eyes.]

749
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:03,139
[The exact same feeling...]

750
00:47:04,418 --> 00:47:06,743
[Who... me?]

751
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:12,309
- Look at that glint in her eyes.
- Why does she look like that?

752
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:16,071
[Come here...]

753
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,182
- Wow, that's some great acting.
- Who else would I be talking to?

754
00:47:21,913 --> 00:47:23,889
There's no need to go this far.

755
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,896
Hey!

756
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:28,498
Is there a need for all this?

757
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:32,773
[Is there a need... to go this far?]

758
00:47:34,174 --> 00:47:37,207
- Is there a need to go this far?
- Do it right!

759
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,721
What are you doing in
the middle of acting?

760
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:44,079
- No, that doesn't count.
- No extra time for them!

761
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:47,027
[Fails to earn themselves extra time.
Only 30 seconds on the clock.]

762
00:47:51,074 --> 00:47:53,595
Dong Hoon had to open the door,
and In Young just climbed over.

763
00:47:56,824 --> 00:47:58,812
It's already all over.

764
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:01,631
[Shoves four sheets of paper at once
out of sheer desperation.]

765
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:07,462
[In Young gets another stack ready.]

766
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,783
[Attempts to get rid of the evidence
by gnawing on the paper.]

767
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,163
[Haroro, the human paper shredder.]

768
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:16,698
We're totally ruined.
Don't even bother doing it.

769
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:26,933
[The powerful looking deluge of water.]

770
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:34,033
This is the end for us.

771
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:37,232
Get out of the car.
Do you see In Young getting angry?

772
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:39,876
[This woman is getting even more
steamed up after that cold shower.]

773
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:43,429
- I can see that In Young's getting angry.
- You have no idea.

774
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:48,102
- Gary and Yoo Ri's turn.
- Gary and Yoo Ri.

775
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:51,295
- Gae-Yoo.
- She's expecting way too much from me.

776
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:56,603
At least she's telling you what to do.
I'm told that I have to figure it out myself.

777
00:48:56,604 --> 00:48:58,183
[Just follow my lead.]

778
00:48:58,184 --> 00:49:02,492
- What is she doing?
- She keeps doing weird things.

779
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,749
[Suspicious looking start.]

780
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,036
- She's really into it..
- You need to get into it too, Gary.

781
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:14,361
[Lee Yoo Ri, the woman who took
all of South Korea by storm in 2014.]

782
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:17,297
[The real evil queen is finally here.]

783
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:19,901
[Gary and Yoo Ri- Take one.]

784
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:29,320
[Kang Gary... are you ready?]

785
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:31,855
[How can I not be?]

786
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:34,305
[Okay, here I go.]

787
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:44,297
[The muddy carwash has now
been transformed into a club.]

788
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:46,965
- What are you guys doing?
- Are you here alone?

789
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,229
- Get lost.
- You want me to get lost?

790
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,855
- Can I get your phone number?
- I told you to get lost.

791
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,934
- It's just that I like your style.
- I said, get lost!

792
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:59,072
I said, get lost!
You dare to block me?

793
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:02,952
[I'm dual handed.]

794
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,779
15 seconds!

795
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,394
[Earns 15 extra seconds-
A total of 45 seconds.]

796
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,600
- See? Being slapped is the best.
- They got 15 extra seconds?

797
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:15,085
- Sorry, okay?
- Two sheets at a time.

798
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:18,961
[Yoo Ri neatly prepares two sheets
for Gary.]

799
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:23,723
I told you to give me just two sheets.

800
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,151
She's really into her acting.

801
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,589
[Putting in one sheet at a time
is noticeably faster.]

802
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,281
[Extra 15 seconds on the clock.
This could be their chance.]

803
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:42,108
[Now that they've gotten the hang of it,
able to shred two sheets at a time.]

804
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:44,033
These are the last two.

805
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:46,374
- Okay!
- Okay, we got this.

806
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:53,571
[If they can get rid of this...
then they can come in at first place.]

807
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:59,084
[Will they succeed on time?]

808
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:02,315
- We got it!
- Show it to us.

809
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:04,065
We got it.

810
00:51:07,393 --> 00:51:10,283
[Gary and Yoo Ri succeed.]

811

perfectly in sync with one another.]

Yoo Ri!

813
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:20,270
I want to go this way.

814
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:23,061
[Why must you go out that way?]

815
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:25,340
Stop doing things like that.

816
00:51:25,827 --> 00:51:29,488
[Completely unpredictable tomboy, Yoo Ri.]

817
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:33,733
First place goes to Gary and Yoo Ri.

818
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,179
[Gary and Yoo Ri take first place
for this second mission.]

819

[Fourth couple- Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin.]

821
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:48,811

don't you?]

822
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:50,779
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin-Take one.]

823
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:53,677

[A Triple Axel on the muddy field.]

825
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,770
- Why are you being like this?
- Let go.

826
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,970
Wow, not bad, Kwang Soo.

827
00:52:08,971 --> 00:52:12,675
- Why are you suddenly doing this?
- No, he's lost it.

828
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:16,349
- No, just endure it!
- What's wrong?

829
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,198
Let go.

830
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:21,466
Let go.

831
00:52:25,188 --> 00:52:27,383
- Let go.
- Why?

832
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:30,091
- He's fallen in love again.
- Even though I love you...

833
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,526
[You still don't want me after this?]

834
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:43,068
[How did she know that she could
get to me by doing that?]

835
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:47,618
- Look at how happy he is.
- Get back into your acting!

836
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:49,940
[The rest of the men are just
showing their jealousy.]

837
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:52,974
Get into the scene with her!

838
00:52:52,975 --> 00:52:56,904
Get your head on straight!

839
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:02,265
You have ten seconds!

840
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,931
[Ten extra seconds on the clock.]

841
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:07,974

a total of 40 seconds on the clock.]

842

[Calmly shredding one sheet
of paper at a time.]

843
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:18,236
Hey, you might not be
able to get it this time.

844
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,391
The last two sheets.

845
00:53:29,392 --> 00:53:30,853
[Only two sheets of paper left.]

846
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,657
Yeo Jin looks like wet seaweed.

847
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:47,861
Kwang Soo, you look like a handsome
heir when you're all soaking wet.

848
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,478
[Heir apparent with the slicked back hair.]

849
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,917
- Too funny.
- You should come out front too, Yeo Jin.

850
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:55,919
Me?

851
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,371
Look at how long her legs are.

852
00:53:58,372 --> 00:54:08,037

[Instant photo shoot by using
the car as her impromptu runway.]

854

She really is a model.

855
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:22,903
[Every single pose she assumes is like
an ad right out of a magazine.]

856
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:27,122
Give us one last pose.

857
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:30,778
[One last couple shot with Kwang Soo.]

858
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:34,502

[Expressing the feel and the romance of
autumn days with their water soaked bodies.]

860
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:45,289

by just sitting like that?

861
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:50,575
[Fifth couple- Jong Kook and Min Seo.]

862
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:53,811
- Just trust in Min Seo.
- Min Seo is no joke with her determination.

863
00:54:53,846 --> 00:54:56,105
- She won't even let me say anything.
- Why is she kneeling down?

864
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:59,644
[So compliant.]

865
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:04,135
That's a real transformation.

866
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:06,925
It's a historical.

867
00:55:07,648 --> 00:55:10,932
[The hip hop hat is transformed
into an aristocrat's hat.]

868
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:15,228
- That was a great idea.
- It's like 'Muscle That Embraces The Sun.']

869
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,855
[Jong Kook and Min Seo- Take one.]

870
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,227
It's 'Muscle That Embraces The Sun.'

871
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:22,502
Your Highness,
please be understanding.

872
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:26,752
- How can I earn back your love?
- That's great acting.

873
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:31,453
- You are not kind hearted enough.
- Just what...

874
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:34,367
How are you saying that she is
anything like that child?

875
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:45,847
<i>Just how... is that wench anything like
the child that died eight years ago?</i>

876
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:49,731
[Min Seo's top notch acting skills.]

877
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:52,621
I was just...

878
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:56,535
Tell me!

879
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:02,131
That was amazing!

880
00:56:02,132 --> 00:56:05,816

[Everyone cheers on the Crowned Princess
for having slapped Kkuk around.]

seconds that they've just earned.]

884
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:19,873
- They've just used up their 15 seconds.
- They've used it up by getting in the car.

885

really bad hand tremors!

886
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:36,198
Just get it in there.

887
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:48,719
[The monstrous strength turns
the manual shredder into a machine.]

888
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,866
It's faster than an automatic shredder.

889
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:53,361
Why did you just give them
an automatic shredder?

890
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:56,977
He's a total machine.

891
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:01,352
[Evidence destruction complete.]

892
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:05,471
[Jong Kook and Min Seo succeed.]

893
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:08,879
[Jong Kook and Min Seo clear
the mission in second place.]

894
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,016
So there's only one winning slot left?

895
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,633
Okay, let's get started.

896
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:17,823
[Sixth couple- Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.]

897
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:21,404
- We don't even know what we're doing yet.
- Okay, we're going to get to it.

898
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,699
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo- Take one.]

899
00:57:26,327 --> 00:57:28,835
[Ji Hyo, let's win this!]

900
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:31,628
[We'll be fine as long as you
do a good job.]

901
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,040
- Here are the files.
- What are you looking at?

902
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:39,932
He's playing the bad guy.

903
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:42,063
[Transformed into
a sharp-tongued bad guy.]

904
00:57:42,064 --> 00:57:44,706
- Stop following me around!
- That's such bad acting.

905
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:47,825
- He's such a bad actor.
- Please don't throw this out.

906
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:51,806
Are you picking that back up?
But you already threw it out.

907
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:53,177
[This bad guy even picks up
after his own trash.]

908
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,088
- He picks up his own trash?
- President Ji.

909
00:57:55,089 --> 00:57:57,138
- What?
- You're rich, aren't you?

910
00:57:57,139 --> 00:58:01,096
Yes, I'm rich.
Is that why you like me?

911
00:58:01,097 --> 00:58:04,618
Are you not from a rich family?
I heard that your house is a lease.

912
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,454
- A lease?
- Only 30 seconds!

913
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:09,658
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo only has
30 seconds on the clock.]

914
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:14,128
You're giving them another 30 seconds?
Ah, 30 seconds total?

915
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:15,895
So they didn't get any extra time?

916
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:18,684
Seriously!

917
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:21,134
Why is the lid coming off?

918
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:27,224
[Sounds like he has the brute strength.]

919
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:29,542
- I think we can get this.
- Get what?

920
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:38,626
Seriously.

921
00:58:38,627 --> 00:58:42,039
[Still far ways to go in his acting...]

922
00:58:43,038 --> 00:58:45,972
- How do you expect me to do that?
- Just hit me like this.

923
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:48,868
- No, I can't do that.
- What are you planning on doing?

924
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:51,796
You know what she just said to me?
She wants me to hit her.

925
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:55,732
[The ultimate plan to earn themselves
some extra time.]

926
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,564
The glint in her eye is different.

927
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:04,648
- Okay, it's only acting.
- You need to get extra 15 seconds.

928
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,020
[Okay, I'll do it.]

929
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,881
You can earn up to a total of
20 extra seconds.

930
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,005
That's enough.

931
00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:14,973
I'm married now.

932
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:16,526
[A knock to the face right from the start.]

933
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:20,017
[This woman is out of control.]

934
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,407
[Another smack.]

935
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:24,401
[And another smack.]

936
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,538
[Doing everything she can to
stop herself from laughing out loud.]

937
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:31,095
Why you!

938
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:35,219
[A woman's greatest weapon...
Her tears.]

939
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:41,729
[Stops her crying just to smack him again...
and again, and again!]

940
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,302
Here, you can hit him with this.

941
00:59:44,303 --> 00:59:45,856
[A fresh stack of paper to keep going.]

942
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:50,647
[I don't know how
this is going to end either.]

943
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:54,370
[Beating Ha Ha around
like simple dance moves.]

944
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:56,036
No!

945
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:57,311
Ten seconds!

946
00:59:57,312 --> 01:00:02,903
[Ten extra seconds on the clock to
give them a total of 40 seconds.]

947
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:05,456
Aren't those sheets all wet?

948
01:00:05,457 --> 01:00:07,210
She already has them all folded.

949
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,804
[In Young already prepared the stack
by pre-folding all the papers.]

950
01:00:11,576 --> 01:00:15,185
- She really is something else.
- She folded them all while acting.

951
01:00:15,186 --> 01:00:17,547
I can't believe she already folded them all.

952
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:23,000
[Thanks to that,
they're noticeably faster.]

953
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,193
- I think they're going to do it.
- Is that their last sheet of paper?

954
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,964
[Already down to their last sheet.]

955
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,127
[Ha Ha and In Young succeed.]

956
01:00:38,128 --> 01:00:41,988
[Ha Ha and In Young come in at
third place thanks to In Young's plan.]

957
01:00:43,263 --> 01:00:47,546
[Second mission winners- Gary, Yoo Ri;
Jong Kook, Min Seo; Ha Ha, In Young.]

958
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,861
I told you at the start of this race

959
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:54,298
that you'll be playing the games with the
person that you're coupled off with now

960
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:58,557
but the couples may get switched around for
the very final round of the mission, correct?

961
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:00,976
- Yes.
- This is when those changes will be made.

962
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:05,706
[The changes made to the couples now
will be the final couples.]

963
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:09,034
I hope that you all have been
very good to your partners so far.

964
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:12,022
- I've been very good to my partner.
- Seo Woo hasn't had any chances to do it.

965
01:01:12,023 --> 01:01:15,312
- I don't know what could've happened.
- I don't know where I'm going to end up.

966
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:18,194
[The men are completely unaware
of what could happen to them.]

967
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:20,929
Third place winner, In Young,
please step forward.

968
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,002
Good luck.

969
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:29,724
Think about who you think could be
the heir and take a look at the hint.

970
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:32,932
- That was great acting.
- No, it was a lie.

971
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:38,001
<i>[Is a big talker.]</i>

972
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:40,670
[But...]

973
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:47,340
[They all like to talk a lot.]

974
01:01:48,394 --> 01:01:51,324
[Even her current partner, Ha Ha,
likes to talk a lot.]

975
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:54,261
[Holding onto Ha Ha for now.]

976
01:02:00,907 --> 01:02:02,843
She's being very serious about it.

977
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:08,008
- That must've been a very clear hint.
- Is she allowed to do all that?

978
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:13,217
[Swaps out Jae Suk and Suk Jin's position.]

979
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,032
I'm positive that In Young
swapped out her partner.

980
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:23,985
Second place winner, Min Seo,
please step forward.

981
01:02:23,986 --> 01:02:27,676
We have to do this well,
and focus on the first place win...

982
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:31,125
- Ugh, that nagging.
- He's like a nagging father-in-law.

983
01:02:34,214 --> 01:02:41,351
<i>[Wears glasses.]</i>

984
01:02:41,352 --> 01:02:46,129
[These three members are
lost without their glasses.]

985
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:54,021
[If I put together all the hints that
I've earned throughout the day...]

986
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:57,231
[Kwang Soo probably isn't it.]

987
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:06,496
[Swaps Kwang Soo out with Jae Suk.]

988
01:03:06,497 --> 01:03:09,982
[Glasses, album, and ddakji-
Jae Suk seems most likely.]

989
01:03:09,983 --> 01:03:13,250
First place winner, Lee Yoo Ri,
please step forward.

990
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:16,056
Everything pretty much rides on
the last person to make any changes.

991
01:03:16,057 --> 01:03:18,787
I shouldn't have done so well
in the beginning.

992
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:22,759
Depending on what Lee Yoo Ri does
once she receives her hint

993
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,528
that will determine the couples that will
enter the final mission location together.

994
01:03:26,529 --> 01:03:28,810
- Okay, I understand.
- Let's win this together, Yoo Ri.

995
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:33,336
I don't know what the
last mission is...

996
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:39,504
[What could her hint be?]

997
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:42,094
You're going to have to
think about this carefully.

998
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,359
[All the men are in extreme
state of nervousness.]

999
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:51,044
[Everything is now in Yoo Ri's hands.]

1000
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:55,984
Okay, the final couples
have now been determined.

1001
01:03:55,985 --> 01:03:58,227
It's time to go to the final mission site.

1002
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:04,051
[Arrives at the final mission site.]

1003
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:06,474
- How many games did you win?
- Two.

1004
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:09,359
Two? Let's trade hint for a hint.
Come on, hurry.

1005
01:04:09,394 --> 01:04:12,050
- Height of at least 170cm.
- I'm 170cm tall.

1006
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:16,052
- Don't lie.
- I'm 172.5cm.

1007
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:19,520
- You guys are seriously mistaken.
- He's not much of a talker.

1008
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:23,647
[From aggression to deceit.
Women's final battle to the end.]

1009
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:25,517
Come in and escort the women away.

1010
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:28,023
- No!
- No, you can't!

1011
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:34,412
[Where are they being taken off to
without any explanation?]

1012
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:40,135
What's going on here?
Are we being split up?

1013
01:04:41,603 --> 01:04:46,333
- Are we all being split up?
- Are we being taken to different locations?

1014
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:51,388
We get different shirts?

1015
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,151
[A different colored shirt in the room
that she's taken off to!]

1016
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:54,891
Do I just change my shirt?

1017
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:59,075
Change right now?
Okay, we'll draw up the viewer ratings.

1018
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:07,493
[Everyone's in their designated spots.]

1019
01:05:07,494 --> 01:05:10,337
The person that you're taken to
will be your final partner.

1020
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:12,022
[Time to go meet their final partners.]

1021
01:05:12,023 --> 01:05:16,979
[The women have swapped out their
partners after having seen the hints.]

1022
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,266
Where do I have to go?
This way?

1023
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:20,709
Who could it be?

1024
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,927
I wonder who it could be.

1025
01:05:22,928 --> 01:05:30,665
Who could it be?
Who's my final partner?

1026
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:33,374
Where's my partner?
There's no one here.

1027
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,847
Ugh, you startled me!

1028
01:05:37,821 --> 01:05:40,166
I'm partnered with the tomboy?

1029
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:42,161
[Couple change- Gary and Seo Woo.]

1030
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,173
- Is it a different partner?
- Ta da.

1031
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:51,303
[Jae Suk's new partner is Min Seo.]

1032
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,503
Then I will take a seat right here.

1033
01:05:53,504 --> 01:05:56,468
How did this happen?
Did you choose me to be your partner?

1034
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:58,748
Yes, I did choose you.

1035
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:00,776
Then I'm the heir?

1036
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:04,662
[That's what I'm hoping.]

1037
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:10,115
[Full of nervous anticipation.
Who could be Suk Jin's new partner?]

1038
01:06:11,832 --> 01:06:15,180
[Yoo Ri swaps Gary out for Suk Jin
after seeing the final hint.]

1039
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:19,228
[What could her final hint have been
for her to have chosen Suk Jin?]

1040
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:24,306
[Final couple selection.]

1041
01:06:25,038 --> 01:06:28,226
I will explain the rules of the game.

1042
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:33,607
[Final mission rule explanation.]

1043
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:36,444
Here's your final mission.

1044
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:41,475
King maker.
Turn my man into an heir.

1045
01:06:42,262 --> 01:06:50,311
Only one couple to stand on the platform
with the heir will win the race.

1046
01:06:50,312 --> 01:06:56,716
But the man sitting next to you
could be the heir or he may not be.

1047
01:06:58,246 --> 01:07:01,806
If you think that your man is the heir...

1048
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:09,012
then find that man's name tag and
stand on the platform with him.

1049
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:16,628
But if you think that someone else other
than your own partner is the heir

1050
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:20,345
then either find the name tag of the man
whom you think is the heir

1051
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:25,179
or rip off that person's name tag
from their back to put it on your man's back

1052
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,191
to stand on the platform stage
to win the mission.

1053
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:32,815
We will now start the race.

1054
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:35,500
So this is sort of a name tag
elimination.

1055
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:38,354
- Will you make me an heir?
- Jong Kook.

1056
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,316
- Please make me an heir.
- Okay, I'll do it.

1057
01:07:41,317 --> 01:07:43,303
The victory will be ours.

1058
01:07:43,304 --> 01:07:49,752
[King maker-
Turn my man into an heir.]

1059
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:52,384
- Let's go!
- What else do you know?

1060
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:56,120
[It is of utmost importance to figure
out who the heir could be.]

1061
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,526
First... I don't think you're it.

1062
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:00,845
Tell me what hints you've been given.

1063
01:08:00,846 --> 01:08:04,283
First, the man is over 170cm tall.

1064
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:06,614
- That's me.
- That eliminates you.

1065
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,780
No, I swear I'm taller than 170cm.

1066
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:11,888
You can't be the only one
arguing that.

1067
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:16,530
- Come on, let's go find my name tag.
- It really isn't you.

1068
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,398
I'm sure that it's me.

1069
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,655
The hints that I have right now
is that he likes idols

1070
01:08:21,656 --> 01:08:23,356
and he also is...

1071
01:08:23,357 --> 01:08:25,196
What is it?

1072
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:27,840
Are you the heir?

1073
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:31,568
- Could it be me?
- I think it could be Ha Ha.

1074
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,873
I think it's me.
Who else could it be but me?

1075
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,352
Yes, you are the heir.
Your white skin makes you look rich.

1076
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:41,346
I've never heard that before.

1077
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:44,601
- Tell me what your two hints are.
- It's a man of immense popularity.

1078
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:46,515
A man of immense popularity?
Really?

1079
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:49,049
- What else?
- The man resembles an animal.

1080
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,697
- Resembles an animal?
- Yes.

1081
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:55,977
- You were partnered with Jae Suk, right?
- Yes, I thought it could be Jae Suk.

1082
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:59,417
- Then Jae Suk could be thinking that too.
- I haven't told him any of my hints.

1083
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:01,140
- You haven't told him any of your hints?
- No, I didn't.

1084
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:03,434
[Gary and Seo Woo suspect
that Jae Suk could be the heir.]

1085
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:07,023
I know that Min Seo swapped
someone out.

1086
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:09,740
[With Min Seo's abandonment,
Mr. Capable and Ace are without any hints.]

1087
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:11,948
We have to keep an eye on the man
that Min Seo's now partnered up with.

1088
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:14,525
Because Min Seo has a total
of three hints.

1089
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:17,232
First, he's released an album.

1090
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:20,230
- Second, he's a good ddakji player.
- That's me!

1091
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:24,355
Third, he wears glasses. But you've
never released an album, have you?

1092
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:28,226
Even though I've never released it myself,
the show I was on released one.

1093
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:31,480
- I think it's me.
- I think so, too!

1094
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:33,719
- Should we just say that it's you?
- Min Seo, I'm the heir!

1095
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,869
- That's me.
- I was confused between you and Ji Suk Jin.

1096
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:40,609
Wait, Suk Jin and ddakji... ah!

1097
01:09:42,695 --> 01:09:44,955
- He's released an album?
- Yes, he's released an album.

1098
01:09:44,956 --> 01:09:50,062
Suk Jin also wears glasses,
and he won the last ddakji battle.

1099
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,451
- Wow, this is confusing.
- Right?

1100
01:09:53,452 --> 01:09:58,307
[Jae Suk and Suk Jin fit all the criteria
of Min Seo's hints.]

1101
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:01,962
- I think you're it.
- You chose me at the end, right?

1102
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:05,989
- You're not a good liar, are you?
- I'm very good at it now.

1103
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,331
- I've had to lie a lot through acting.
- Really? But you never used to be?

1104
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:12,814
- You're not lying right now, are you?
- I did lie about one thing.

1105
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:17,030
[It's plain to see that this evil queen
is in fact a sweet cutie pie.]

1106
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:18,729
- What is it that you're lying about?
- Can I say it out loud?

1107
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,538
[She hasn't shared the hint
that Ha Ha gave her earlier.]

1108
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:24,988
- That's what Ha Ha told me.
- That he's a man of few words?

1109
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:27,581
Is that what Ha Ha told you?
Then just think the opposite.

1110
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:30,909
You actually believed him?

1111
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,108
You actually believed what
Ha Ha told you?

1112
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,526
[But what's the final hint
that Yoo Ri was given?]

1113
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:39,660
Want to start from the top
and work our way down?

1114
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:42,778
- The waiting room is here...
- You make me a little nervous.

1115
01:10:43,636 --> 01:10:47,001
You get a new train of thought in
your head once every five minutes.

1116
01:10:47,002 --> 01:10:48,541
- Right?
- That might be true.

1117
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:51,874
Gary, you could be the heir bastard.
I mean...

1118
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,636
Heir bastard?

1119
01:10:53,637 --> 01:10:57,765
[Seo Woo's tongue speaks freely
just like her brain thinks so freely?]

1120
01:10:58,483 --> 01:11:00,771
I'll make you an heir.

1121
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:05,545
- Someone chose Suk Jin, right?
- I know. I think it's Suk Jin.

1122
01:11:05,546 --> 01:11:09,592
[Mr. Capable and Ace are trying to deduce
a guess from all the couple swapping.]

1123
01:11:09,593 --> 01:11:12,905
It feels weird to be walking
down the aisle with you.

1124
01:11:13,611 --> 01:11:16,576
[Mr. Capable and Ace are busy
searching for the name tags.]

1125
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:17,993
Hey.

1126
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:21,328
[Lee Kwang Soo's name tag
is discovered.]

1127
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:24,277
[This couple is good at everything they do.]

1128
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:25,986
Okay, put this on my back for now.

1129
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:28,760
[It's up to the team to decide whether
they want to keep the name tag or not.]

1130
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:31,866
If Kwang Soo wants to rip it off,
then let him do it, okay?

1131
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:36,070
[Jae Suk and Min Seo are busy
searching through the first floor.]

1132
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:39,020
- It's in here.
- What?

1133
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:41,370
- The platform is in here.
- The platform?

1134
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:45,266
- What if they hid it around the platform?
- Min Seo, this is the place.

1135
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:50,095
Min Seo, this is where we need to come
when we find either Suk Jin's or my name tag.

1136
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:51,674
- Really?
- We need to find one or the other.

1137
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,170
Just knowing where this is at
could be a big advantage for us.

1138
01:11:56,307 --> 01:11:59,933
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin are walking around
with Gary's name tag stuck on his back.]

1139
01:11:59,934 --> 01:12:02,463
- What is this?
- There's more than one name tag?

1140
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:05,817
- You have Gary's name tag?
- Dong Hoon has a name tag on too.

1141
01:12:05,818 --> 01:12:08,514
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha both have
Ha Ha's name tag on their backs.]

1142
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,873
[There are several of the same
name tags hidden throughout the place.]

1143
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:14,449
[Then we need to hurry before
the others find what we need.]

1144
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:16,925
- You two are partners?
- Yes.

1145
01:12:16,926 --> 01:12:21,727
- That's just cheating!
- We have an idea of who it could be.

1146
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:24,919
- We don't have a single hint.
- She doesn't have any hints.

1147
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,338
- Just tell us one hint.
- It's about the amount of hair on his head.

1148
01:12:27,339 --> 01:12:29,949
[A total lie.
Yeo Jin's confused.]

1149
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,709
- What?
- About the amount of hair he has.

1150
01:12:34,555 --> 01:12:37,399
I don't think she's heard that before.
You haven't heard that before, have you?

1151
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,737
[Unable to control her facial expressions.]

1152
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:42,695
I really can't lie.

1153
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:44,783
[Yeo Jin's face is a clear indication
of whether a lie is being said or not.]

1154
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:48,424
You two should at least get your
stories straight before you tell your lies.

1155
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:51,139
- I know him way too well.
- I can't control my facial expressions.

1156
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,131
Just go sit and wait over there
and let me talk to these guys alone.

1157
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:58,922
- Come on, just tell us something.
- Just one thing. We've got nothing.

1158
01:12:58,923 --> 01:13:01,144
- Tell us something.
- We're positive that it isn't you.

1159
01:13:01,145 --> 01:13:05,784
- You don't think it's me?
- Min Seo has the most number of hints.

1160
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:08,536
- And she swapped you out for someone else.
- Yes, I know.

1161
01:13:08,537 --> 01:13:10,684
I think it's Jae Suk.

1162
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:16,191
No one's taking Kwang Soo's
useless name tag.

1163
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:20,172
[Kwang Soo's less than popular name tag.]

1164
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:24,697
Hey.

1165
01:13:25,832 --> 01:13:28,588
[Just then, Suk Jin and Yoo Ri are seen
heading toward Jae Suk's direction.]

1166
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:31,724
[Yoo Hyuk gets on idea to play
a trick on them.]

1167
01:13:31,725 --> 01:13:34,283
[They take the bait.]

1168
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,628
I think that's my name tag!

1169
01:13:36,254 --> 01:13:39,042
[Puts on an act by running away with
Kwang Soo's useless name tag.]

1170
01:13:39,043 --> 01:13:41,385
[Suk Jin and Yoo Ri take off after them
without even knowing what's going on.]

1171
01:13:41,894 --> 01:13:45,190
[All the members rush over
after hearing the commotion.]

1172
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:50,200
[Let's stop them from running
any further.]

1173
01:13:51,408 --> 01:13:54,858
[What a mess.]

1174
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,790
[Total chaos.]

1175
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,927
[A group of people falls for
Yoo Hyuk's bait.]

1176
01:14:01,928 --> 01:14:03,718
Just give it to them.

1177
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:06,904
Just let them have it.

1178
01:14:07,418 --> 01:14:10,196
[Suk Jin and Yoo Ri thinks they've got
something and start to run away.]

1179
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:13,080
Forget this!
You can have it.

1180
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:18,321
- You scared me.
- I got them.

1181
01:14:18,322 --> 01:14:21,240
Did you just trick us?

1182
01:14:22,345 --> 01:14:24,510
- You seriously startled me.
- Sorry, Yoo Ri.

1183
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:27,800
[Just wait and see.]

1184
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,824
Yoo Ri's angry right now.
She scares me.

1185
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:33,138
[Back to searching for the name tags.]

1186
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:39,720
[This time, he discovers a
'Reserved' sign.]

1187
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:41,723
Min Seo.

1188
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:44,282
[Takes off running again.]

1189
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:46,492
I'm not falling for it this time.
You have to put the name tag on.

1190
01:14:47,844 --> 01:14:50,785
[Are you sure you won't
fall for it again?]

1191
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,874
[Could it be for real this time?]

1192
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,673
[A total con artist... and the hopeful.]

1193
01:15:01,614 --> 01:15:05,087
What's wrong with you, Yoo Ri?
What's wrong with you?

1194
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,314
[Yoo Ri follows him down
to a different floor.]

1195
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:08,191
Hand it over.

1196
01:15:08,192 --> 01:15:10,278
Where's Min Seo?

1197
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:13,308
[Yoo Hyuk plays it off to the end.]

1198
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,180
Stop trying to take it away from me!

1199
01:15:19,143 --> 01:15:21,940
[Devastated]

1200
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:23,702
Hey!

1201
01:15:23,703 --> 01:15:25,982
We don't need any reservations!

1202
01:15:26,554 --> 01:15:31,590
[But what is the reason for Yoo Ri
being so hot on Jae Suk's tail?]

1203
01:15:33,213 --> 01:15:36,355
[After their final game.]

1204
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:39,180
[Yoo Ri was given the hint
for the first place winner.]

1205
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,889
[What did her hint say?]

1206
01:15:42,556 --> 01:15:48,665
[Initial, 'J'.]

1207
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,579
[The heir's initial is, J.]

1208
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:56,118
[If it's a 'J'...]

1209
01:15:56,847 --> 01:16:00,114
Jae Suk, you seem happier now
that I'm no longer your partner.

1210
01:16:00,115 --> 01:16:03,704
No, I'm not happier. We just
have different paths to take.

1211
01:16:03,705 --> 01:16:05,914
Oh my goodness.

1212
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:12,317
[Jae Suk discovers someone's name tag.]

1213
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:13,926
I see.

1214
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:16,303
[Wait, that's...]

1215
01:16:16,304 --> 01:16:20,124
[Yoo Jae Suk.]

1216
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:23,675
[The most likely heir candidate,
Yoo Jae Suk's name tag.]

1217
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:28,593
[Jae Suk, Min Seo, Gary, and Seo Woo
all think that Jae Suk is the heir...]

1218
01:16:28,594 --> 01:16:31,442
I can't believe that I just found this.

1219
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:32,451
[Seo Woo closes in.]

1220
01:16:32,452 --> 01:16:37,399
[If Jae Suk really is the heir, then that
name tag would mean their victory!]

1221
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,604
- Seo Woo, I'm going to put this on my back.
- Okay.

1222
01:16:39,605 --> 01:16:42,863
- Let me just put it on my back.
- Okay, fine.

1223
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,437
- Come on, Seo Woo.
- I said, I got it.

1224
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:47,818
Come on, seriously!

1225
01:16:47,819 --> 01:16:51,044
Gary!
Come and help me!

1226
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:52,576
[Calls out to Gary for help.]

1227
01:16:53,607 --> 01:16:57,361
[Jae Suk and Min Seo take the
name tag and run.]

1228
01:16:57,362 --> 01:17:02,401
[With the name tag on his back, they run
toward the platform they found earlier.]

1229
01:17:03,877 --> 01:17:06,695
- Did you find it?
- We found something.

1230
01:17:06,696 --> 01:17:09,197
- Suk Jin's name tag?
- Where are you going?

1231
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:13,677
[Breaks out into a run from
his leisurely stroll.]

1232
01:17:13,678 --> 01:17:15,767
- Come on, hurry.
- Did you find it?

1233
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:18,307
[Both members of the couple must be on
the platform together for the judging.]

1234
01:17:19,665 --> 01:17:22,525
[We must stop Jae Suk!]

1235
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:27,121
[A physical block.]

1236
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:29,699
Why are you just standing there?

1237
01:17:31,415 --> 01:17:35,655
[Kwang Soo and Yeo Jin takes the chance
to go up on the platform themselves.]

1238
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:39,648
[Waits for the judging with
Ha Ha's name tag on his back.]

1239
01:17:42,211 --> 01:17:44,534
[Ha Ha isn't the heir.]

1240
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:48,591
[In that case...]

1241
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:53,160
[Jae Suk and Min Seo succeed in
getting on top of the platform.]

1242
01:17:53,161 --> 01:17:55,219
Are they it?

1243
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:59,103
[Jae Suk has his own name tag
on his back.]

1244
01:17:59,104 --> 01:18:05,236
[Many of these other teams already
think that it could be Jae Suk.]

1245
01:18:05,237 --> 01:18:06,743
Please.

1246
01:18:06,744 --> 01:18:10,309
[Could he be the true heir?]

1247
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,403
- He's taller than 170cm.
- He's immensely popular.

1248
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:15,529
He resembles an animal.
I think it's Jae Suk.

1249
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:21,322
[All the hints that have been given out
seem to point to Jae Suk.]

1250
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:23,014
I think it's you!

1251
01:18:23,714 --> 01:18:26,638
<i>- I think it's Jae Suk.
- Right? I think it's him, too.</i>

1252
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:30,375
No way.

1253
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:35,490
[In that case...
could Jae Suk be the true heir?]

1254
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:38,490
It's not him!

1255
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:41,301
[Jae Suk isn't the true heir!]

1256
01:18:41,844 --> 01:18:44,459
[It isn't him?]

1257
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,323
[Initial 'J' and immensely popular...
If it isn't Jae Suk...]

1258
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:55,855
[It has to be another 'J'...]

1259
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:59,622
I think it's me.
I have a feeling that it's me.

1260
01:19:02,311 --> 01:19:05,159
[After the first game.]

1261
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,079
[The first place hint that
Yeo Jin received.]

1262
01:19:08,617 --> 01:19:13,051
[He's a member of the Traitor's club.]

1263
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:18,967
[The heir is a member of
the Traitor's Club!]

1264
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:22,324
[Popular]

1265
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:35,952
[The heir of this drama is, Ji Suk Jin.]

1266
01:19:35,953 --> 01:19:40,402
I can't believe that my dream of being
a second generation heir has come true.

1267
01:19:41,914 --> 01:19:44,222
Hey, it's Suk Jin.

1268
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:46,711
- It's Suk Jin.
- It's Suk Jin?

1269
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:50,402
It's Ji Suk Jin.
It's definitely Suk Jin.

1270
01:19:50,403 --> 01:19:52,770
[Everyone's sure that the heir
is now Suk Jin...]

1271
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,557
It's either me or Suk Jin?

1272
01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:58,201
I don't think it's Jong Kook.
It maybe you!

1273
01:19:58,202 --> 01:19:59,491
[But this one couple still hasn't
been able to move on...]

1274
01:19:59,492 --> 01:20:02,269
- I think my man is the heir!
- What did I tell you?

1275
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,033
- Marry me, Kwang Soo!
- What did I tell you!

1276
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:06,667
[As long as they're happy...]

1277
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:09,586
- This must be our wedding hall.
- Yeo Jin, I'm an heir.

1278
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:13,305
- How can this even be?
- If I'm the heir, I'll be right back here.

1279
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,592
- You won't abandon me, will you?
- My parents can be here very quickly.

1280
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:20,954
You asked if he'll abandon you?
I guarantee that it isn't him.

1281
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:24,952
[While this wannabe heir is
busy dreaming of what could be...]

1282
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,915
[Yoo Ri is busy searching for the real
heir Suk Jin's name tag.]

1283
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,037
This is hairspray.

1284
01:20:32,437 --> 01:20:36,528
[Sprayed hairspray all over her face
thinking that it was a moisture mist.]

1285
01:20:36,529 --> 01:20:39,701
- I thought it was a moisture mist.
- What did you just do?

1286
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:44,444
- Really?
- Yoo Ri, what's wrong with you?

1287
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:48,416
- That's hairspray.
- You're a little off.

1288
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:51,405
- Thankfully, it wasn't an insect spray.
- She's such a positive thinker.

1289
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:53,311
[Such a positive thinking woman.]

1290
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:57,581
It has to be around here somewhere.

1291
01:21:00,082 --> 01:21:02,067
No, it's not around here.

1292
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:04,647
I'm not good at finding things like this.

1293
01:21:04,648 --> 01:21:07,399
I wonder if it could be under here?

1294
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,439
[It's a battle against time.
Who will find the name tag first?]

1295
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:14,131
[Kwang Soo leaves his hopes behind
and starts searching for Suk Jin's name tag.]

1296
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:26,625
[Did he find something
under the tablecloth?]

1297
01:21:26,626 --> 01:21:30,527
[Ji Suk Jin]

1298
01:21:30,528 --> 01:21:34,489
[He just now needs to stand on top
of the platform with the name tag  on.]

1299
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,065
[Just then, Suk Jin
and Yoo Ri enter the room.]

1300
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:39,709
[Please don't come any closer.]

1301
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:43,060
[Something looks a little suspicious.]

1302
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,977
What?

1303
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:51,384
- Kwang Soo.
- We need to get it from him.

1304
01:21:51,385 --> 01:21:54,119
- Wait a minute.
- There you all are.

1305
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,168
[Hyenas smell the scent
and start to close in.]

1306
01:21:56,169 --> 01:21:58,376
- My guess was correct.
- I knew it too.

1307
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:02,625
- Okay, let's just go quietly.
- Let's just get out of here first.

1308
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,057
[Traitor's Club agrees to leave before
anyone else sees them together.]

1309
01:22:05,058 --> 01:22:07,523
I promise that I won't run.

1310
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:12,212
[The three couples agree to go down
to the first floor together.]

1311
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:17,041
[The Giraffe flees!]

1312
01:22:19,387 --> 01:22:22,030
[But the other two members of
the Traitor's Club already suspected it.]

1313
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:25,603
[It's war!]

1314
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:29,127
Yeo Jin!

1315
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:32,299
I just need Kwang Soo to get down here.

1316
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,215
[The number of
heir hopeful keeps on growing.]

1317
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,647
[Kwang Soo is made a mess out of.]

1318
01:22:36,648 --> 01:22:38,697
I wonder if he'll be able to
get down here safely.

1319
01:22:39,309 --> 01:22:41,648
[No, I don't think that's possible...]

1320
01:22:41,649 --> 01:22:46,167
Let's be more dignified about this.
Can you back up the cameras?

1321
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,541
Can you please leave us for now?

1322
01:22:50,606 --> 01:22:53,902
[Suk Jin's name tag falls into Suk Jin
and Yoo Ri's hands at the end of the battle.]

1323
01:22:53,903 --> 01:22:56,099
- Come on, hurry!
- Where's my shirt!

1324
01:23:00,068 --> 01:23:02,029
[Gary swipes the name tag away.]

1325
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,318
[More chaos ensues.]

1326
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,927
- Seo Woo, where are you?
- Wait, I'm coming!

1327
01:23:07,928 --> 01:23:10,203
You have to get it on your back.

1328
01:23:10,204 --> 01:23:12,501
Yoo Ri is like a bounty hunter.

1329
01:23:15,368 --> 01:23:17,959
Wait, Min Seo.
You just hit me in the chin.

1330
01:23:18,871 --> 01:23:22,275
[No conceding for these thorny roses!]

1331
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:27,645
- Let's not be like this.
- She says it with a smile on her face.

1332
01:23:27,646 --> 01:23:30,583
Someone just get down here
with the name tag.

1333
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:33,695
- We can't have Jong Kook come here.
- One of you come down with the name tag.

1334
01:23:33,696 --> 01:23:36,745
No matter how we do this,
Jong Kook is waiting for us below.

1335
01:23:38,296 --> 01:23:39,710
- Min Seo.
- Yes?

1336
01:23:39,711 --> 01:23:41,625
- Where are you?
- What is it?

1337
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:43,542
[Jae Suk is calling Min Seo away.]

1338
01:23:43,543 --> 01:23:45,869
<i>- What is it?
- How many name tags are there?</i>

1339
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:47,578
[It was said that there are
several name tags hidden throughout...]

1340
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:52,656
[While they're all fighting over that one,
let's just go find another name tag.]

1341
01:23:54,049 --> 01:23:58,275
[With the exception of Jae Suk and Min Seo,
everyone else is battling it out here.]

1342
01:23:59,638 --> 01:24:03,063
[We must find it before their battle ends.]

1343
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:06,118
Let's all join hands
and head over to the elevator.

1344
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:12,109
[They must find the name tag before
one of the other teams gets to the platform.]

1345
01:24:18,404 --> 01:24:20,746
[He finds it!]

1346
01:24:22,918 --> 01:24:26,335
[Jae Suk miraculously finds
another name tag!]

1347
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:29,836
Let's figure it out once we get there.

1348
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:33,272
But I just can't understand why
you must be the one to take it there.

1349
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:39,368
[Before they come...
they must get on that platform.]

1350
01:24:45,426 --> 01:24:52,379
[Just who will be the first to arrive?]

1351
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:57,537
[Jae Suk and Min Seo beat them to it!]

1352
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:05,220
[Steps onto the platform with
Ji Suk Jin's name tag on his back.]

1353
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:11,053
[Can't be...]

1354
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:21,155
[Jae Suk and Min Seo are the final
winners of the race!]

1355
01:25:21,156 --> 01:25:22,957
We did it!

1356
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:26,002
I knew we could do it!

1357
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:29,459
I found it by the reservation table.

1358
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,384
- I found it by the reservation table.
- Anyone but my old partner...

1359
01:25:33,739 --> 01:25:35,953
- I wish it could've been anyone else.
- I'm sorry about that.

1360
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:42,584
Suk Jin, it's over.

1361
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:47,043
[Rushed over without even being
aware that the race is over.]

1362
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:51,796
[Unfortunately, Suk Jin is an heir
in namesake only.]

1363
01:25:53,813 --> 01:25:56,643
[A small and humble ceremony.]

1364
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,752
It's a ring!

1365
01:25:59,753 --> 01:26:03,108
[Min Seo receives a prize of a gold ring
for helping her man become an heir.]

1366
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:07,293
[For Jae Suk...]

1367
01:26:09,546 --> 01:26:14,264
[A grand Director's name plaque.]

1368
01:26:14,265 --> 01:26:16,282
This should say 'Kim Jong Kook' on it.

1369
01:26:16,283 --> 01:26:19,455
But the best part of it all is
that my name is stickered on there.

1370
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:23,375
[That's because we didn't know
who was going to win.]

1371
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:25,469
What the heck is this?

1372
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:27,707
Happy birthday to you...

1373
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:31,764
[A surprise birthday party for Ha Ha,
whose birthday was the day of the filming.]

1374
01:26:31,765 --> 01:26:34,441
Your partner, In Young,
prepared that cake for you.

1375
01:26:34,442 --> 01:26:38,006
- Wow, seriously?
- Happy birthday.

1376
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:42,961
[These actresses are not only beautiful
in looks, but in their hearts as well.]

1377
01:26:44,592 --> 01:26:49,114
[We hope that the next time we meet is
as warm and lovely as it was today.]

1378
01:26:49,445 --> 01:26:53,689
