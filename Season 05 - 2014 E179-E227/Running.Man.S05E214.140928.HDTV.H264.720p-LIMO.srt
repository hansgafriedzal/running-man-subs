- Get ready.
- Fighting!

167
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,420
[Starting off on the opposite ends
for the second round.]

168
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,000
Fighting!

169
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,450
[Both teams are full of energy.]

170
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,910
[Passing through the net obstacle.]

171
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,940
[Team MLG is about to enter
the rubber curtain obstacle.]

172
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,900
[Once again, Rain takes care of
his team from behind.]

173
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,670
[If we keep going at this pace,
then we can catch up to them!]

174
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,390
- Run!
- Hurry!

175
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,470
[Great plan of teamwork by lifting up
the net for one another.]

176
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,820
[Team RM also seems to have gotten
better at their teamwork skills.]

177
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,990
Who made such a wave of this mat?

178
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,640
[Must run before they're caught.]

179
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,280
[The body is caught on the net,
and is brought to a screeching halt.]

180
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,550
[Let's make our escape!]

181
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,970
[A new plan to hold up the net
for the person coming up behind them.]

182
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,890
- The bottoms of my feet are killing me.
- Slow down.

183
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,540
[Team MLG is keeping up the pace.]

184
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,110
[Hot on their trail!]

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
[Gary is caught on the net.]

186
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,150
[Giraffe is making sure to
check the health of his back.]

187
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,500
[How many laps has it been already?]

188
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,790
When is this ever going to end!

189
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,910
- There is no end to this game!
- This is a test of our endurance!

190
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,340
[It's all about endurance now.]

191
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,110
- I feel like this is never going to end.
- Let's just end this.

192
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,130
[Team RM is working hard
to catch up to Team MLG.]

193
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,880
Catch them!

194
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,430
[Quickly passes through the rubber curtain
thanks to Rain and his polite manners.]

195
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,770
[As soon as they get through the curtains...
Giraffe sticks his body through.]

196
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,190
[Only a three meter gap between
the two teams!]

197
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,920
[Let's go catch their tail!]

198
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,020
[Team RM finally catches up to Team MLG.]

199
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,070
Come on, you can't do that!

200
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,010
- No, you can't do this!
- Hurry up and do it!

201
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,850
[Giraffe raises his hands up to the sky
with some help from Rain.]

202
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,560
- Hurry up and do it!
- I got it!

203
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,900
[Team RM wins
the second round of the relay.]

204
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,830
Can we do the third round next week?

205
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,070
Let's take a little break.

206
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm sorry, but let's get going.
We're not even tired yet.

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,340
- Okay, fine.
- No, we need a moment.

208
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,970
Young Kyu, are you crying?

209
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,600
- Young Kyu.
- Are you crying?

210
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,540
[I told you that I wanted to
take a little break...]

211
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,980
Why are you acting like that?

212
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,340
- Young Kyu, can I try it, too?
- We've already tried it.

213
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,540
- His pants are like a raincoat.
- They're the waterproof pants.

214
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,880
[His pants seems to be very popular today.]

215
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,610
- Are they coated with something?
- Are these pants the same?

216
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,090
Oh, maybe they're not.

217
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,800
- Sorry, I thought they were the same.
- What are you doing?

218
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,700
- He looks so pathetic now.
- Don't shake my pants.

219
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,770
No, don't do that.

220
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,100
Oh, I'm so sorry.

221
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,670
[Yoo Hyuk's simultaneous
shower of water and humiliation.]

222
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,130
- No, don't shake it.
- We've never seen anything like it.

223
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,280
- Ugh, seriously.
- Come on, I'll help you get up.

224
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,720
Wait, I'll do it when I'm ready.

225
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,230
[Can't you guys just leave me alone?]

226
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,170
[Final round of the acupuncture mat relay.]

227
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,310
It's hard to decide
who to eliminate at this point.

228
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,500
- No, it's not hard to decide.
- No, it's not hard to decide.

229
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,130
- I feel like it's really tough to decide.
- It's not difficult to decide at all.

230
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,180
I feel like it's such a close call
that we're going to have to draw for it.

231
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,900
Let's just win the relay mission,
and we won't have to worry about it.

232
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,880
[Win the relay and there
would be nothing to worry about.]

233
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,020
- Okay, let's win this.
Fighting!

234
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,530
- I'm going to run faster this time, okay?
- Okay, run.

235
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,720
- Let's just get this over with.
- Let's just win this thing.

236
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,410
No need to draw this out any further.

237
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,770
This is the final round to
determine the winning team.

238
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,900
The loser team will have to
eliminate one member from the team

239
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
and once eliminated, that person
can no longer participate in the race.

240
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,010
Okay!

241
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,100
[Will they be the ones to catch,
or the ones to get caught?]

242
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,610
[Win this round...
and escape elimination!]

243
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,410
[Rain doesn't hesitate to sacrifice
himself for the sake of his team.]

244
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,550
- Grab it!
- Grab it and walk through it.

245
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,190
[Even though they have it figured out,
it's still very chaotic.]

246
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,370
Okay, open it up.

247
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,770
[Bodyguard Rain.]

248
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,510
We're almost there.

249
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,610
[Krystal is running hard enough to
make the bottoms of her feet sweat.]

250
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,650
- We're almost there.
- Grab it!

251
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,180
[Team MLG is very hot on Team RM's trail.]

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,960
We got this!

253
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,650
We have to hurry!

254
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,140
[Moment of imminent danger!]

255
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,530
[Team RM escapes danger by
the split of a hair.]

256
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,480
[Call us Speed Racers!]

257
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
We have to hurry!

258
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,560
[Must quickly pass through
the rubber curtain obstacle!]

259
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,540
[She's tangled up!]

260
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,130
[Team MLG succeeds in
catching up to Team RM.]

261
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,890
[IF Gary's name tag is ripped off,
then Team MLG wins!]

262
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,700
- We won!
- What did you guys do?

263
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,140
[Team MLG shows off their
great team working skills.]

264
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,070
- Young Kyu, we did it.
- Good job, Krystal.

265
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,950
Team MLG wins the first
team battle mission.

266
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,660
[Survival audition- Team battle.
Team MLG wins!]

267
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,450
- They're such an unlikely team.
- How could they have won?

268
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,610
- It doesn't make any sense to me.
- We shouldn't have allowed that small break.

269
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,400
Why are you sitting down again?
Why are you sitting down after one game?

270
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,230
Why don't you lay down for a bit?

271
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,730
- Why do you keep sitting down?
- I've seen this before in your drama.

272
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,310
As just mentioned, Team MLG won
the first survival audition mission.

273
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,770
One member from Team RM will now have
to be eliminated and kicked off the race.

274
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,420
Don't just automatically think
that person is going to be me.

275
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,570
You never know how it'll end up.

276
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,110
Think about this very carefully, Kwang Soo.
Why do you just assume that it'll be me?

277
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,650
- Can I pick for the whole team?
- Kwang Soo, you just pick.

278
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,310
[No need to even vote because
it's already a unanimous decision?]

279
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,650
- Ha Ha made a lot of mistakes.
- Okay, I'll give you that.

280
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,270
- We got caught because of you.
- But that was an unfair circumstance.

281
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,340
[Ha Ha (from his mistakes) vs
Suk Jin (for being the weakest link)]

282
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,610
- We got caught because of you.
- This is driving me crazy.

283
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,670
You need to think about this
very carefully.

284
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,150
[Time to cast their elimination votes.]

285
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,120
Okay.

286
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,450
- Yes, I know.
- No need to think too hard about it.

287
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,020
[A very precious vote to decide
who gets to stay and who gets to leave.]

288
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,160
We will now reveal the voting results for
the first elimination round of R-Pop race.

289
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,800
Let's not get mad about it because
we're all of the same team.

290
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,700
- No getting mad. I'll be fine with whatever.
- Let's all join our hands together.

291
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,960
I can sacrifice myself
for the sake of my team.

292
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,180
[The louder their voice is, the
more nervous they must be feeling.]

293
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,680
You have to know who was at fault
for our first round of defeat.

294
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,540
Ha Ha.

295
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,070
[One vote for Ha Ha's elimination.]

296
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,340
I think that's my handwriting.

297
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,800
One for Ha Ha.

298
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,400
[Maintaining a cool demeanor.]

299
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,900
- Thank you.
- Ha Ha's being cool about it.

300
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,310
I think we're going to have to wait and
see to find out what the results are.

301
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,150
Kim Jong Kook.

302
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,140
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Who voted him out?

303
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,890
- The handwriting is...
- What?

304
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,700
[Can guess who voted him out
without even needing to ask.]

305
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,030
- Just think about the race as a whole.
- This is so unfair!

306
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,740
As you can see from the tiny handwriting,
you can guess who wrote this, right?

307
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,350
- It really wasn't me.
- There better not be two votes.

308
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,710
- What? Is it me again?
- It really remains to be seen.

309
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,130
- AH AH.
- Who's 'Ah Ah?'

310
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,250
[No, it's Ha Ha.]

311
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,670
[Elimination vote result-
Ha Ha- 2; Kim Jong Kook- 1.]

312
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,580
[Ha Ha is in the lead with two votes.]

313
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,970
[Only three votes left to go.]

314
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay, that's another one for Ha Ha.

315
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,110
I already have two votes?
Thank you.

316
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,680
- Wow, this is no joke.
- Who is it?

317
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,430
- Kim Jong Kook.
- I still don't have a vote yet!

318
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,730
[Elimination vote result-
Ha Ha- 2; Kim Jong Kook- 2.]

319
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,180
- None for me!
- This is unbelievable.

320
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Come here!

321
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,360
[No matter what the vote may be for,
these two are the biggest suspects.]

322
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,290
[Only two more votes left to go.]

323
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,570
Okay, it's another one for Ha Ha.

324
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,920
Someone wrote that they're sorry,
but we don't need that.

325
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,550
- Was it you?
- Sorry, Ha Ha.

326
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,090
Ki Bang, you're getting into it.
It's Ha Ha, isn't it?

327
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,620
You have to keep going.

328
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,600
[Assistant MC is proving to be
quite useful.]

329
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,670
It's time for the last final vote.

330
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,100
You have to lower the noise level
when I start talking.

331
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,440
- You have to know when to be quiet.
- Yes, that's right.

332
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,440
[Elimination vote result-
Ha Ha- 3; Kim Jong Kook- 2.]

333
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,070
[Who will the last vote be for?]

334
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,440
[Ha Ha]

335
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,470
[Elimination vote result-
Ha Ha- 4; Kim Jong Kook- 2.]

336
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,470
[First person to be eliminated- Ha Ha]

337
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,880
- It really wasn't me! Why do you think that?
- Go away!

338
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,430
Is there another elimination round?

339
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,520
[One member will be eliminated
after each round of missions.]

340
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,400
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Why would you say that!

341
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,190
Why would you point me out?
It could be any one of us!

342
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,920
I thought one of you would
stand up for me.

343
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,680
Shall we go on to the next round
of missions?

344
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,140
[How does it feel to be eliminated?]

345
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,740
I really hope that everyone fails.

346
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,330
I wish I could lay down a pair
of scissors in their beds.

347
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,630
What are you doing?

348
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,850
- Why? What are you doing?
- I'm doing an interview!

349
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,490
- Really?
- Yes.

350
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,660
There's one person that I really
have a grudge against.

351
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,450
He's slightly heavy.

352
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,270
- What are you doing!
- I'm just trying to get by.

353
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,870
Can't you see that I'm trying
to do an interview?

354
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:36,220
I really hope that they'll come to
regret ever having eliminated me.

355
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,950
I really hope that they fail at
every single thing that they do.

356
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,990
[Korean National Athletic Center]

357
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,460
[Arrives at the second mission location.]

358
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,140
[The remaining survivors will now move onto
the second portion of the audition.]

359
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,640
Is this where we're going?

360
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,290
- Athletic center?
- That's a really nice athletic center.

361
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,720
- Look at the goal post.
- Are we playing volleyball?

362
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,700
- Are we playing basketball?
- Dong Hoon's really good at basketball.

363
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,330
[That's why you never should've
voted me out...]

364
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,930
[He's joined by Alex, who was
eliminated at the previous mission.]

365
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,090
If we just get sent home at the end without
getting the chance to do anything else...

366
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,100
- That's happened a few times.
- Seriously? That's happened before?

367
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,480
[What fate awaits these
eliminated contestants?]

368
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,400
This is the collaboration mission for
the 2014 R-Pop Star Race.

369
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,140
Just like the way it states,
it'll require help from other people

370
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,200
in order to successfully pass
the mission.

371
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,130
Three very special people have come
to help with this portion of the race.

372
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,660
Three commentators from the 2014
Incheon Asia Games are here to join us.

373
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,100
- Seriously?
- For real?

374
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,090
It's Im Oh Kyung!

375
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,450

for 2014 Incheon Asian Games.

388

389
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,560

for 2014 Incheon Asian Games

391

for the SBS station.

392
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,430
- The crowned prince of the basketball court.
- He was amazing.

393
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,920

- He still looks the same as ever.
- The crowned princess of the courts.

395
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,830
- Yes.
- And the magician of the nets.

396
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,310
[Magician of the nets.]

397
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,810
For your third mission,
it's a mix of sports and music.

398
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,680
Both teams will choose challenges
from these three sports.

399
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,990
- How do we play it?
- If you win two of the three...

400
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,190
then that team will win the mission
for being best out of three.

401
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,320
- How can we ever beat them?
- We're no longer professional players.

402
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,930
- But you were all professional players.
- But you're on a national league level.

403
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,320
When it comes to physique,
your body is a national league level.

404
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,310
Here's the first round
of your collaboration mission.

405
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,800
It's called, Dancing Goal Keeper.

406
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,060
While the selected members dance
in front of their goal posts

407
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,770
Im Oh Kyung will attempt to throw the ball
into the net once the music stops.

408
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,440
The team that blocks the most number
of balls wins the round.

409
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,850
- All five of you will be doing it.
- Then we'll be able to stop her.

410
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,570
- Then we'll be able to block her.
- We can block all of them, right?

411
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,640
- Okay, this is good.
- Your team can go first.

412
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,070
- Why don't you take the corner?
- Okay, I'll take the corner.

413
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,820
Are you sure you'll be able to
get around five goal keepers?

414
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,300
It would be easier if this ball was softer,
but this ball won't be easy to control.

415
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,350
But the goal posts are set
pretty wide apart.

416
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,580
- That's the only good thing.
- We have to keep dancing?

417
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,510
- Okay, let's start the first round!
- I have to score a lot of balls?

418
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,260
- You have to score as many as you can.
- Don't go easy on them.

421
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,260

[Unsatisfied]

423
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,120
[Perfectly in sync with one another.]

424
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,120
[Up the level of excitement.]

425
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,560
[Can't stand it.]

426

[This is the signature shoot
of a legendary handball player.]

434
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,950
- Don't avoid the ball!
- I didn't avoid it.

435
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,540
[Their bodies automatically avoid the ball.]

436
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,150
- Why are you avoiding it?
- It's so scary!

437
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,500
- That's one.
- Don't avoid it, and just let it hit you.

438
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,420

[Kwang Soo's black hole sucks
the ball into the goal instead.]

443
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,750
I didn't avoid the ball!
I didn't even move.

444
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,580
[Master Im Oh Kyung seems to be
enjoying herself immensely.]

445
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,290
I didn't avoid the ball!
I didn't even move.

446
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,260
You can't just stand still.
You have to block the ball!

[Can I?]

456
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,140
What are you doing?

457
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,610
- Your goal is over there!

- You're getting her mad.
- Is there only one ball left to go?

465
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,210
One more to go.
We have to block this one.

466
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,720
You did good!
That's how you do it!

[Offering shoulder massage service so
that she could make more goals?]

473

I only want Kwang Soo
to touch me.

474
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,180
- I said, I only want Kwang Soo to do it!
- Why?

491
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,430
Thank you.

492
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:08,430
[Her love for him as his fan weakens
even her fastest throws...]

493
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,920
- What was that?
- Why did you do that?

494
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,850
- My shoulder didn't fully rotate.
- That was so unfair.

495
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,480
[Explosion of envy.]

496
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,630
Can the opposing team
get out of here?

497
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,220
Thank you!

498
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,990
Can you throw it in
Park Young Kyu's direction?

499
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,320
[Clean as a sharp blade.]

500
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,480
- I was trying to block it in my own way.
- What were you doing?

501
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,690
- Just hold still.
- Hold still, and you can block it.

502
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,990
- How many do we have left?
- You have to block the rest to win.

503
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,160
[Only three balls left to go!
Block all the balls to win.]

504
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,970
[Ma'am... he says that
we have to block the rest...]

505
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,640
[You're the best!]

506
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,700
[In the midst of all that...]

507
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,580
[The ball that Ki Bang kicks away...
smacks Kwang Soo right in the face.]

508
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,470
I'm so sorry!

509
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,620
What was that?

510
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,960
[Giraffe definitely has the god of
the variety world looking out for him.]

511
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,360
- Why did you do that?
- What was that all about?

512
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,980
- You need better sportsmanship!
- I'm sorry.

513
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,630
His teammates don't even care that
he just got slammed in the face.

514
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,790
- His face is there for the balls to smack.
- He just got smacked in the face.

515
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,370
- That's what his face is there for.
- Fighting!

516
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,360
[Time for the mission to resume.]

517
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,250
You have to make the rest of the goals.

518
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,480
Raise your arms up like this.

519
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,150
[Yoo-hole is predictable as always.]

520
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,800
[The scaredy cat is pushed off
into the corner.]

521
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,720
- He needs to stand in the corner.
- We have one shot left.

522
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,560
Im Oh Kyung!

523
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,120
[If she scores, then it's Team RM's win.
Block the ball, and it's a tie.]

524
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,880
[Flies into the air!]

525
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,400
[Just then, Rain jumps out to the front.]

526
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,290
[Will he be able to block it?]

527
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,460
[Rain misses the ball,
and the ball makes it into the net!]

528
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,160
[So disappointing...]

529
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,800
Let's win in the badminton
and the basketball games.

530
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,170
Thus, the first round's victory
goes to Team RM.

531
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,250
[First round's victory in the mission with
Master Im Oh Kyung goes to Team RM.]

532
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,850
We will now start the second round with
Woo Ji Won's basketball game.

533
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,890
Time for the basketball mission.

534
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,880
The next mission is,
Filial Chair First Syllable Quiz.

535
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,470
You'll listen to the first line of the song
that Woo Ji Won will be singing

536
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,310
and if you correctly guess the song,
then scoot up in the chair and grab the flag.

537
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,280
- What does it have to do with basketball?
- If the answer is guessed correctly...

538
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,370
then Woo Ji Won will throw a three point
shot in place of the winning team.

539
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,810
Then the team with the most three point
shots thrown by Woo Jin Won wins the game.

540
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,110
[More questions that are correctly answered,
then more chances for a three point shot.]

541
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,290
I think we'll be familiar with
most of the songs.

542
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,050
[Correctly guess
Woo Ji Won's favorite songs!]

543
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,820
[First song]

544
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,420
<i>First...</i>

545
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,310
I know this one!

546
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,170
[Kwang Soo vs Jae Suk.]

547
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,110
[Chance for Kwang Soo of
Team RM to guess the answer.]

548
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,600
I've sang this song
while playing the piano.

549
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,630
- Yes, that's the one!
- Yoo Jae Ha's 'Because I love you!'

550
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,940
<i>First, I felt the way you
gazed at me...</i>

551
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,880
<i>First...</i>

552
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,300
[Could this be the same song?]

553
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,800
No, that's not right.

554
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,110
- Listen to it carefully, and try again.
- I don't think I know this song.

555
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,200
[What could it be?]

556
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,660
- First?
- I have no idea.

557
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,020
Okay, I'll sing it better this time.

558
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,690
[More accurate singing?]

559
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,110
<i>First.</i>

560
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,690
[Huh?]

561
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,310
[The chance goes to Rain.]

562
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,000
'The final battle.'

563
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,860
'The final battle.'

564
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,830
<i>First, can...</i>

565
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,500
- Yes, that's the one!
- I think he's right.

566
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,960
[The theme song from the legendary
basketball drama, 'The Final Battle'.]

567
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,430
<i>First can never be predicted...</i>

568
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:04,240
[Could it be?]

569
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,260
<i>First can never be predicted...</i>

570
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,820
[An irrefutable singer!
Rain's accurate listening ears!]

571
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,970
His tone was way too flat!

572
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,700
[Strongly disputes it.]

573
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,370
'First time when we met...'
That's what it sounded like!

574
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,560
[Could he be tone deaf?]

575
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,770
- You can't tell by the way he sang it.
- That's the way I always heard it.

576
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,180
I'm going to have to think
outside the box.

577
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,990
- You have to listen very carefully.
- Please sing it accurately.

578
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,180
- Please get the tone correctly.
- Ready.

579
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,200
- Oh...
- What was that?

580
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,120
What was that?

581
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,920
- Oh...
- What was that?

582
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,880
Jong Kook!

583
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,280
[Rain succeeds in blocking Team RM.]

584
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,210
'Last night's story' by Fire Truck!

585
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,810
<i>Last night, I really hated you.</i>

586
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,520
- No, that's not it!
- 'Last night, my dad...'

587
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,330
['Last night's story' by Fire Truck.]

588
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,590
[Wrong]

589
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,550
Okay, listen very carefully.

590
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,880
[One more time.]

591
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,710
[Tiger on the move.]

592
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,680
Ugh, seriously!

593
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,660
[Will Kkuk have the correct answer?]

594
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,110
- What's your answer?
- 'Even though I loved you' by Kim Kwang Suk.

595
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,790
- No, that's not it.
- 'All day yesterday...'

596
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,360
- 'It kept raining...'
- That's a totally different tone.

597
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,020
- What's wrong with that?
- You can't sing it like that!

598
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,310
[Forcing out the tune.]

599
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,430
- One more time.
- 'All day yesterday...'

600
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,660
- 'It kept raining...'
- He really sounds like a singer!

601
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,460
[Could this be the same song?]

602
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,700
- It sounds so sweet!
- That's not the right one?

603
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,140
[Excuse me,
but that's the wrong song.]

604
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,790
Why did you make me sing it again?
I thought I had it right!

605
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,250
[Kkuk sang it with all the emotions
that he had... just to get it wrong.]

606
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,360
- Seriously.
- Are you dumb?

607
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,610
- You almost had me fooled.
- You were really getting into it.

608
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,370
- Okay, here's a good hint.
- Listen very carefully.

609
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,620
[A top notch hint.]

610
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,100
[Everyone seems to have figured it out now.]

611
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,750
[Too much rushing around.]

612
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,190
[Complete chaos.]

613
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,640
[Krystal totally blocks off Kwang Soo.]

614
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,540
[While Krystal blocks everyone off
with the use of her body...]

615
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,440
[Rain grabs the flag.]

616
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,960
I have to do this one.

617
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,170
- It's my Jin Young's song.
- Park Jin Young.

618
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,270
- 'Behind you!'
- Sing it.

619
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:32,730
- He doesn't know the song either.
- 'Did you know that it rained last night?'

620
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,420
He's a good singer.

621
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:42,700
['Behind you' by Park Jin Young.]

622
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:51,450
[Could this song be the correct answer?]

623
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,810
[Correct answer.]

624
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,890
[Team MLG correctly answers
another three pointer!]

625
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,270
- Great job, Krystal!
- You did good!

626
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,290
[Krystal gave them this opportunity.]

627
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,400
We got the answer thanks to Krystal.

628
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,630
[Next song...]

629
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,990
'One man' by Kim Jong Kook?

630
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,230
[Team RM correctly guesses the song.]

631
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,610
<i>'I got tired from waiting...'</i>

632
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,890
[Team MLG correctly guesses
another answer.]

633
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,090
[A total of three shots for Team MLG,
and one three pointer for Team RM.]

634
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,130
[A total of three shots for Team MLG,
and one three pointer for Team RM.]

635
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,510
[One chance for Team RM.]

636
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,340
I love you!

637
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,130
- Don't say things like that!
- Woo Ji Won!

638
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:43,530
[Will the master of
three point shots make it?]

639
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,730
[Please...]

640

[Success!]

641
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:00,430
[Team RM succeeds their shot,
but Team MLG has three chances.]

642
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,770
How about he shoots without
jumping from his stance?

643
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,020
- Stop being ridiculous.
- He should be able to do that, right?

644
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,790
[First attempt for Team MLG.]

645
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,640
[Even without jumping...
he makes a clean goal.]

646
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,430
[That's our Woo Jin Won!]

647
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,470
- Okay, we're tied.
- We just need one more shot.

648
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,830
[If he makes this shot,
then Team MLG wins the mission.]

649
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,160
[Bounces off the rim,
and misses the shot.]

650
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,720
Why are you purposely missing
the shot?

651
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,270
- He was trying to make a clean shot.
- I shot it too high.

652
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,580
[Current score- 1:1.
Final chance at making the shot.]

653
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,510
[Makes this shot,
and Team MLG wins the mission.]

654
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,410
[Please make the shot...]

655
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,110
[No!]

656
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,650
[The fate of the two teams
lies in Woo Ji Won's hands.]

Everyone always touches their racket when
they miss a shot in badminton.

700
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,920

- What is this?
- Isn't this the K-Pop music stage?

820
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,990
[Entering the brightly lit audition stage
like that of K-Pop Star.]

821

[Even a judging platform has
been prepared.]

822
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:56,760
The final mission for
the 2014 R-Pop Star still remains.

823
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,770
The final mission is...
a real audition.

824
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,210
[Real audition]

825
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,000
Is a real audition.

826
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,520
We have assigned a specific song
and performance to each team.

827
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,660
You will have to utilize the song given to
give us your most impressive performance.

828
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,300
[Team MLG-
Michael Jackson's 'Billy Jean']

829
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:29,830
[The King of Pop, Michael Jackson.
The legendary song from his Thriller album.]

830
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,670
[Team RM-
'One Night Only' from Dream Girls OST]

831
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:41,950
[The theme song with soul and rhythm
from 2007 hit film, Dream Girls.]

832
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:49,700
We will now welcome the panel of judges
who will be judging your performance.

833
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,060
Let's welcome our panel of judges!

834
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,840
[The panel of judges who will determine
the fate of these two teams...]

835
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:07,650
[The eliminated members.]

836
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,750
[The past eliminated contestants
will be their panel of judges.]

837
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,530
The surviving audition contestants will soon
be arriving here for their final mission.

838
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,810
- What are we going to be doing?
- Seriously?

839
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:25,230
[They will become the panel of judges.]

840
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,690
[This is the chance to get
their revenge.]

841
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,570
I will show them what it means
to be truly unscrupulous.

842
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,990
[You didn't know that this
was going to happen, did you?]

843
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,810
Hello, Sirs!

844
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,910
Please take good care of us.

845
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,380
There will be no fairness, or justice.

846
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,830
That's because there's a lot of sarcasm
and grudge built up inside us.

847
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,410
We're all hurt and disappointed
by the way you've treated us.

848
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,170
Even though we acted cool about it,
the rest of you up on the stage right now

849
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:02,870
I hope that you'll be understanding even if
we end up saying a few hurtful words.

850
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,670
[Wait in anticipation for what may come
your way from this panel of judges.]

851
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,430
[Will these contestants be able to
impress this panel of judges?]

852
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,530
[Team MLG's dressing room.]

853
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,750
- How about 'Lend it to us?'
- Sure, that's a good line.

854
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,730
[From 'Billy Jean' to 'Lend it to us'
Starting off with changing out the lyrics.]

855
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:23,000
[Ki Bang is getting into the groove of it.]

856
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,860
Don't give Ki Bang too many
lines to sing.

857
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,510
[Falling perfectly in line.]

858
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,890
'Lend me your heart...'
Something like that.

859
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,320
- 'My heart' Ow!
- You're not the lead singer.

860
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,330
[Lusting after being the lead singer
with every chance that he gets.]

861
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,610
I don't know why I keep wanting
to be the lead.

862
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:47,170
- 'Lend me your heart...'
- We have to be sexy with it.

863
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,540
- How?
- 'Lend me your heart...'

864
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,820
'As a collateral.'
Something like that.

865
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:02,880
- 'Lend me your unsecured heart...'
- 'Without any interest!'

866
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,640
There you go.
That's just what I mean.

867
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,960
[The lyrics are starting to flow along.]

868
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,200
<i>Lend me your unsecured heart,
without interest as a collateral.</i>

869
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,050
- 'Can't you trust me?'
- There it is!

870
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,020
[Satisfaction]

871
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,350
[Team RM.]

872
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,650
[Panel of judges are coming by
to check on their progress.]

873
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,320
- How are things going?
- Yes, it's going well.

874
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,230
Just because you try hard
doesn't mean that it'll work.

875
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,730
I'll give it my best.

876
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,890
Hey, Kwang Soo.

877
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:47,410
We're finally starting to
get through to them.

878
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,350
We're supposed to look like women.

879
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:54,550
[Gary plus a wig = Visual shock]

880
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,600
- This is making me feel dizzy.
- That wig looks perfect on you.

881
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,760
I can't find any wigs
that look good on me.

882
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,110
I think this one looks great on you.

883
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:09,770
[Giving us so much to anticipate for
no matter which wig he puts on.]

884
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,930
- That's the one.
- You look like a middle aged woman.

885
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:18,450
I wasn't too happy about it earlier,
but I like being in this position now.

886
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,640
- Hello.
- Hello, welcome.

887
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,700
Hello, judges.

888
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,580
This team isn't as polite.

wished us a bountiful new year.

- Okay, that's enough.

892
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,600
- Okay, we heard you.
- Yes, Sir!

893
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,310
[Winning the favor from this panel of
judges is the key to winning the audition.]

894
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,660
- We will give it our best shot!
- Okay, we heard you.

895
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,930
[I will endure through this.]

896
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,030
I said, I heard you.

897
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,030
We will see you later.

898
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,620
[Completely focused on preparing for
the show even in the midst of all this.]

899
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,940
Ji Hoon's working so hard at it.
He's not even saying goodbye to us.

900
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,950
- We'll see you all later.
- Have a great day!

901
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,560
- Bye, see you.
- Good luck.

[The three eliminated contestants have
been reborn as the panel of judges.]

take home the golden mics?]

what they will be looking for.

907
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:55,260
I'm so happy and impressed by the fact that
they were able to do this within an hour.

908
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,920
I was impressed as a judge,
but that's just a feeling of emotion.

909
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,400
[Judging and emotions are
two completely different things.]

910
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:11,120
The important thing is that my judging will
be done fairly, accurately, and seriously.

911
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,360
Team RM will perform first.

912

As for your score...

964
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,510
it may not have anything to do
with the entertainment factor.

965
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:27,270
- But you can't do that.
- That has to remain a factor in scoring.

966

lacked practice?

a time or two, isn't that correct?

[A perfectly executed performance
of dancing and singing.]

1036
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:58,550
Team MLG, are you sure that you came
up with this in just an hour?

1037
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:03,220
Are you sure that you didn't have this
already prepared at home?

1038
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,770
No, we didn't.

1039
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:07,090
I love how the lyrics were transformed.

1040
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,940

as a collateral, and free of interest.'

1041

I was really impressed by how well everyone
just fit into the performance together.

1042
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,650
I can't believe that you were able to
put all that together within an hour.

1043
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,290
- I was very impressed, thank you.
- Thank you.

1044
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,930
I highly respect you.

1045

Even though I didn't like getting eliminated,
I'm thankful that it happened.

1046
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,000
Because it makes me think that
had I been a part of the show

1047
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,540
I would've broken up the perfect
harmony that the four of you had.

1048
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:48,800
It was that perfect!

1049
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:53,470
Don't you think that
you're being too biased?

1050
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:57,180
- You're seriously being too biased!
- No, I'm not!

1051

talking first.]

1082
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,910
[Team RM will win as long as
Alex's score is above 90 points.]

1083
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:28,430
90 points or more, and we win.

1084
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,480
[It all comes down to Alex's score.]

1085
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,220

[This isn't the end!]

1102
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:50,710
Before the winner's ceremony,
the winning team must...

1103
01:14:50,710 --> 01:15:02,150
Select one of the judges to help train them
to become the next top musical star.

1104
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:05,850
Even the judges weren't aware of this.
But once one of the judges are selected

1105
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:11,960
then the remaining two will
have to face their punishment.

1106
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,680
- What did you say?
- Please reveal the punishment!
