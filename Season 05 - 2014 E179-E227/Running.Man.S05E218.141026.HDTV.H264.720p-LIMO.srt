- How many dimples does she have?
- Wow, look at her cute dimples!

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,142
You're right, she does have
three dimples.

102
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:05,416
She wanted four dimples, but she
doesn't have enough money for it yet.

103
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:09,130

- Have you never experienced him yet?
- Ji Hoon's a little weird.

105
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:19,072
He was so distracting, loud,
and meddlesome on our way here.

106
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:22,391
- He's a bit strange.
- Ji Hoon's strangely alluring.

107
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,260

[Our application forms

111
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,482

Listen to the children's tune
that we'll be playing for you

117
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:57,258
and reenact the performance precisely
within the chances that you're given.

- How is that even a challenge?

119
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:03,352
[Isn't that too easy?
We're all musical geniuses!]

120
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,806
The instrument which you will be
playing is hung up on the ceiling.

121
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,941
- What is it?
- Is that a piano?

122
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,450
Is that even possible?

123
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,504
[A gigantic piano.]

124
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,965
[A cymbal and a drum are also
seen hanging on the ceiling.]

125
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:22,482
[Seven people on the piano, one on the drum,
one on the cymbal, and one vocalist.]

126
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:26,497
You want us to play these with our heads?
That's too advantageous for the Giraffe!

127
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,372
- I think I've done this before.
- Aren't we all on the same team?

128
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,917
[His head didn't even
graze the piano keys...]

129
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:42,282
- I didn't even hear anything.
- Suk Jin, you got your hair dye on it.

130
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:48,785
[Big-nose's hair dye leaves a mark
on the snow white keyboard.]

131
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:52,105
- What are you doing?
- Don't spray so much color on your hair!

132
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:55,132
- What is that?
- You got the keys all dirty!

133
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,174
Do we have to hit the cymbal
with our head, too?

134
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:00,496
- Yes, you'd have to use your head.
- You have to hit the cymbal with your head.

135
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,125
[A real piano sound!]

136
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:08,740
- What was that note?
- Sounds like someone is playing it.

137
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,140
No, it's connected to an
electronic sensor.

138
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,628
[I've got you!]

139
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,767
[The best human sensor that the
21st century has to offer.]

140
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,555
[Why does he have to be
such a curious sort?]

141
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,059
- They almost had me fooled.
- He's so scatter-brained.

142
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,639
- He's really distracting.
- And he's also very obsessive.

143
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,218
He's really suspicious
and not the trusting sort.

144
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,217
Let's pretend that never happened.

145
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:36,731
I will now play the song
that you will have to re-play.

146
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:42,880
[A song that we're all familiar with-
'Winter breeze.']

147
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:49,184
We have to make sure to
get the beat.

148
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,773
[Must be sure to get the right beat between
the piano, drum and the cymbal.]

149
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,133
We have to make sure to get
the beat right.

150
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:55,121
We have to get the beat right.

151
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,146
- Can you sing the notes?
- Mi, fa, sol, la, sol.

152
00:10:58,147 --> 00:10:59,828
- Fa, mi, rae, do, do.
- She has it perfect!

153
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,604
She really is a genius!
She knows all the notes!

154
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,632
[Able to pick out all the notes
throughout the song!]

155
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,951
- Eun Ji knows all the notes. Gary!
- Yes?

156
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,455
- You take the cymbal.
- Okay!

157
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:15,864
[Gary to take charge of the cymbal.]

158
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,243
We need another person for 'Do'.

159
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,369
- Mi, fa, sol, la, sol, do.
- Jong Kook can do both.

160
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,305
[Jong Kook to take care of both notes?]

161
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:27,533
- We need another person for that note.
- Maybe I shouldn't be standing here.

162
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:32,040
[Since 'Do' seems to be a popular note,
Kwang Soo is given the task.]

163
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,046
- There are a lot of 'do' notes.
- Only one person per note.

164
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,004
If Kwang Soo is doing the high 'Do',
then he has to do the low 'Do' as well.

165
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:46,154
[Once a 'Do', then always a 'Do.']

166
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,336
- Yes, we should do it that way.
- You take them both.

167
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:51,908
- Kwang Soo can take them both.
- How can I take them both?

168
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,726
Okay, that's a good decision.

169
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,184
Ji Hoon, what are you doing?

170
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:06,658
What are you doing?
Why is your hand down your pants?

171
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,574
[Ji Hoon's naughty hands.]

172
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,817
We've all been practicing, but
what are you doing with your hand?

173
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,789
My shirt is sticking out as if
my stomach is all bloated.

174
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,702
- I'm going to go very slow.
- Okay, sounds good.

175
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,960
- Challenge! One, two, three.
- Challenge!

176
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,814
[Body performance- First attempt.]

177
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,850
- Challenge.
- Okay, let's do this.

178
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,365
Set, go!

179
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,083
[The piano performance is spot on.]

180
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:41,592
[But Ha Ha's drum is ignoring
all the beats.]

181
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,446
[He was given the easiest task,
but misses everything from the start.]

182
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,100
- No, I'll do it.
- I'll do better, I promise.

183
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:52,312
I promise, I know what to do now.

184
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,935
[Last chance for Ha Ha,
the drummer boy.]

185
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,254
If you mess up again, you're finished
here, and we're kicking you out.

186
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,188
Who are you to do that?
Who do you think you are?

187
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:02,548
[The musical geniuses fierce battle.]

188
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,327
- Tell him that he'll be kicked out.
- I'll be the one to kick anyone out.

189
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,485
Okay, then I'll help you take him out.

190
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,442
Okay, I got it.
Does everyone agree?

191
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:15,979
- The same rule applies to you.
- Mess up again, and you're all kicked out.

192
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,850
- Okay, let's do it.
- Challenge!

193
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,633
- Challenge!
- Set, go!

194
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:32,425
[Ha Ha misses the beat again.]

195
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,867
- You're not hitting it!
- What?

196
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,989
- Tell me what I'm doing wrong!
- Take that off.

197
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,463
[Forced out as promised.]

198
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,577
You hit the drum
when you weren't supposed to.

199
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:48,659
[What humiliation is this from
a simple mistake?]

200
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,163
No, just take off his socks,
but we'll take off more next time.

201
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,288
- You'd better watch it.
- That's enough for now.

202
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:58,216
You better watch it, got it?
Get yourself together.

203
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,023
You'd better watch it if you don't
want to get kicked out for good.

204
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,645
[Pull yourself together!]

205
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:07,493
- I'll go here, so move over.
- Why are you so much shorter?

206
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,886
Why are you so much shorter
all of a sudden?

207
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,268
[Why do you think?]

208
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:16,579
Eun Ji, is it like this?

209
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,764
[Big-nose is now in charge of the drum.]

210
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:23,455
[Practicing his beats to avoid receiving
the same humiliating treatment.]

211
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:26,419
[Striving for perfection.]

212
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,103
Eun Ji looks like an animal trainer.

213
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,337
[Looking at Eun Ji is like looking
at an animal tamer.]

214
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,000
[Will the animal tamer have an effect
on the outcome this time around?]

215
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:42,239
- It's already our third attempt?
- Challenge!

216
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,969
Set, go!

217
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,278
[Big-nose, this isn't the time!]

218
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:06,747
[Perfect varied beats.]

219
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,319
[The drum may be easy to hit,
but the beat isn't easy to match...]

220
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:15,090
[As before, he's immediately stripped
of his drumming role.]

221
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,123
- No, that's not even right!
- You want the mic clipped to your bare skin?

222
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,022
- Why are you doing this?
- You want the mic clipped to your bare skin?

223
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,860
[Position elimination is getting harsher.]

224
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:27,078
No, that's not it!
You guys are moving too slow!

225
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:30,728
Tell me if you want your mic to be
clipped onto your bare skin.

226
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,920
I thought you're supposed to be
the drumming genius.

227
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:37,041
- I thought you said you were good?
- You said you knew what to do.

228
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:40,565
Swap him out.
Let's get it right this time.

229
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,673
[Body performance- Fourth attempt.]

230
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,985
[Ji Hoon is put in charge
as the new drummer.]

231
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,226
- I haven't done this yet.
- 'Ri' is your note.

232
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,446
- Set, go!
- I have to start?

233
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,916
- This is my first time doing it.
- He's making me feel nervous.

234
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,131
Wait!

235
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,642
[Missed beat.]

236
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,461
[Misses four drum beats in a row.]

237
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,121
But you got further than anyone else.

238
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:30,963
- You're actually pretty good.
- Get his shoes.

239
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,132
No, not my shoes!

240
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,433
- What kind of socks are those?
- What's with these socks?

241
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:38,049
- What kind of socks are those?
- What is that on your socks?

242
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,265
What is this, Ji Hoon?

243
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,219
[Air shoe lift!]

244
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,770
You're such a con!

245
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,220
[With the lift out of his shoes, his
eye level is now lower than it was.]

246
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,727
Even I don't use this high of a lift!

247
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:55,648
- Just pretend that you didn't see it.
- Pretend we didn't see it?

248
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,025
[Body performance- Fifth attempt.]

249
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,938
Now!

250
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,200
Now!

251
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,808
[An absurd mistake by Big-nose.]

252
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,648
- Take it off.
- Why did you jump then?

253
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,385
No, stop it!
You told me to do it!

254
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:37,801
No, you told me to.
Hey, Yeon Seo.

255
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:41,400
[Why is he calling Yeon Seo over?]

256
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,462
He took off his pants.

257
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:54,427
[Look is transformed into a skirt fashion
reminiscent of the roman days.]

258
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,343
We had no other choice.

259
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,358
I can't even turn around in this.

260
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,829
This is actually for the better.
Keep facing forward.

261
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,755
[A man should never turn his back.]

262
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,267
- This will help with his concentration.
- Yes, that's right.

263
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,159
Okay, let's try it again.

264
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,538
Okay, let's try it again.

265
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,691
[Fails the sixth and seventh attempt,
and now on their eighth attempt.]

266
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,050
Okay, we're all set.

267
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:19,938
Eun Ji, why are you taking off your jacket
when you haven't made any mistakes?

268
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,924
- Because I was getting hot.
- Keep it on in case you make a mistake.

269
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,842
What if you make a mistake?

270
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,241
- What are you even saying?
- How can you even say that?

271
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,242
[We made it very clear that
there will be exceptions...]

272
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,493
- You never know what'll happen.
- What are you even saying?

273
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:37,325
- Okay, this will be your eighth attempt.
- Get ready! One, two, three.

274
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,111
- Challenge!
- Set, go!

275
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,362
- Run quickly!
- It's okay, take it easy.

276
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,610
- Hurry back!
- Hurry!

277
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,406
[Giraffe's critical role.]

278
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,791
[Giraffe misses his aim.]

279
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,399
I told you to go slow!

280
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,598
You said I was doing a good job!
I'm working harder than anyone else!

281
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,703
[We know you're working hard,
but rules are still rules.]

282
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,585
- We just need to take this off.
- This is going too far.

283
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,159
[Since I've worked so hard,
can't you forego my socks?]

284
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,077
[What utter nonsense!]

285
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,226
- You don't have to do this, do you?
- Look at me!

286
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:52,368
[The aristocratic fashion prohibits him
from doing anything too active.]

287
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,918
- We have to stay focused.
- We're almost there.

288
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,927
- This is our last chance.
- Seriously?

289
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:03,135
- Can you give us two more chances?
- No, we can't.

290
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,646
We can't make any mistakes
this time.

291
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:11,811
- How can you do it like that?
- Saying it once was enough!

292
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,292
I was going to stop saying it, too.

293
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,504
[Why are you yelling like that?]

294
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,389
- Can't you go easy on us?
- Why do you keep repeating yourself?

295
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,811
Okay, get ready.
This is your last chance.

296
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,080
[Everything is riding on
this one last attempt.]

297
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,477
[Body performance- Final attempt.]

298
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,107
- Okay, let's do this.
- Let's get this done.

299
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,903
Set, go!

300
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,332
[The perfect harmony.]

301
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,696
- Slow.
- Slow it down.

302
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,975
[These geniuses are making
perfectly harmonious music together.]

303
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,650
Take it slow.
There you go.

304
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,246
[Giraffe with the
two Do's and two hearts.]

305
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,154
[Almost made a mistake.]

306
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:19,376
Good, Kwang Soo!

307
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,834
[Giraffe's flying performance.]

308
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,673
[Down to the final bar.]

309
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:33,541
It's the last note!

310
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,241
[Only one final note left in the song.]

311
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,186
[Their final chance-
We'll get it this time!]

312
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:49,464
[Admission mission- Body performance.
Mission success.]

313
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,100
[The ten musical geniuses
finally succeeds the mission.]

314
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:01,474
Congratulations, you barely succeeded
the mission on your tenth and final chance.

315
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:05,946
Although you've succeeded, since
you succeeded on your tenth attempt

316
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:11,379
only seven out of the ten of you will have
the chance to participate in the event.

317
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:14,512
[Only the best of the best are
given the chance to participate.]

318
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:19,333
Oh Yeon Seo, Song Ji Hyo, and
Jung Eun Ji failed to pass.

319
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,799
They failed to obtain
the admission for the event.

320
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,914
Why is it only the women?

321
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:27,288
- You're right!
- That's all our top players!

322
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:29,480
Eun Ji did all the hard work!

323
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,896
- But Eun Ji did all the hard work!
- No, I didn't.

324
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:36,106
You will be given exactly ten minutes.

325
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:40,473
Find the blank application forms that are
hidden outside this practice room

326
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:43,284
write down your names on it,
fill out your forms

327
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:46,630
and turn it back in to be given
the chance to participate.

328
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,665
- Okay, go!
- How is it be all the girls?

329
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,708
- Did they receive a special mission?
- We'll be back!

330
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:57,463
[Off to find the blank application forms!]

331
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,576
The rest of you can start practicing.

332
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:04,788
[Must find the application forms
within ten minutes.]

333
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:10,056
[The remaining geniuses start
their own individual practicing.]

334
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:13,881
I feel bad for those three girls.

335
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,411
We didn't mean for that to happen.

336
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,204
That was the best performance
of my life.

337
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:21,719
- Aren't you a pianist?
- Let's all perform together!

338
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,322
I play the harp as a hobby.

339
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,677
Let's all play together for once.

340
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,037
- Okay, let's go.
- One, two, three, four!

341
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:32,432
[Right at this moment!]

342
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:39,550
[The musical geniuses' disastrous harmony.]

343
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,458
<i>Jung Eun Ji, Out!</i>

344
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:56,372
[Jung Eun Ji... out?]

345
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:02,203
[How can this be?]

346
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:04,718
- What was that?
- Jung Eun Ji is out?

347
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,012
- Jung Eun Ji, out?
- Eun Ji is out?

348
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,256
She's ousted?

349
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:13,591
- Why is Eun Ji ousted?
- There must be something going on.

350
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:16,562
[Why is Eun Ji suddenly ousted?]

351
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,082
What's going on here?

352
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,128
Why is Eun Ji ousted?

353
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:25,490
[Just what in the world is going on?]

354
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:27,953
What is this about?
Why is Eun Ji ousted?

355
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:30,935
- Ji Hyo, why is Eun Ji ousted?
- Eun Ji's been ousted.

356
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,385
[Just then, Ji Hyo comes back in
with an application form in hand.]

357
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:34,438
- I don't know what happened either.
- Let me see your name tag.

358
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,331
- Is there something going on?
- How did she get ousted?

359
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:40,551
- Why would she be ousted?
- Where did she go?

360
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:44,771
- Where's Yeon Seo?
- Yeon Seo didn't oust Eun Ji, did she?

361
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,823
Something doesn't feel right about this.

362
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:50,684
[Ji Hyo and Yeon Seo are the only ones
who left the room with Eun Ji.]

363
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:53,956
I just found this on the third floor,
and there was no one up there.

364
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:57,119
[I really don't know...]

365
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,834
- What's going on here?
- There's Yeon Seo.

366
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,432
- Yeon Seo's scaring me.
- Does she know what's going on?

367
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,274
- I found it!
- That's not the issue. Eun Ji's been ousted.

368
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,154
- Eun Ji's been ousted.
- Why did she get ousted?

369
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:14,282
- Did you oust her?
- Why would I oust her?

370
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:17,128
- You scare me.
- Why are you so happy to hear the news?

371
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,373
[Seeming very suspicious of Yeon Seo
and Ji Hyo for Eun Ji's elimination.]

372
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:22,944
I heard the announcement,
but I thought it was for something else.

373
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,528
Wouldn't the culprit be one of the girls
who went out with her?

374
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,606
It couldn't have been me because I found
that sheet after I heard the announcement.

375
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,786
[It really isn't me...]

376
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:35,315
I'm really suspicious of Ji Hyo.

377
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:38,503
- I swear that I'm innocent.
- Seriously?

378
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:42,172
- But the rest of us were all together.
- Then there's another culprit out there?

379
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:47,310
I'm sure that this is all a set up.
Jung Eun Ji is the real culprit.

380
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:50,541
- What's going on here?
- Why did Eun Ji get ousted?

381
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:54,672
[Just what in the world is going on here?]

382
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:56,741
What's that?
Is there an announcement?

383
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:59,790
<i>This is the Running Concourse Committee.</i>

384
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,014
<i>We have an announcement to make
to all of you in the auditorium.</i>

385
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:10,634
<i>The Running Concourse will still take
place on stage as originally planned.</i>

386
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,429
<i>In order to participate in the concourse,
you must submit an admission form</i>

387
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,965
<i>and take a picture of yourself with
the instant cameras that we have hidden</i>

388
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:20,577
<i>and bring them both back
to the admissions office.</i>

389
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,851
- What's going on here?
- Where did our Eun Ji go?

390
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:28,198
- What happened to Eun Ji?
- The culprit has yet to be found.

391
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,358
[The culprit has yet to be caught.]

392
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,029
<i>Find the hint to determine
who the culprit is </i>

393
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:39,153
<i>and use the building's telephone system
to report who the culprit is when found.</i>

394
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,376
<i>However, if an innocent person is
falsely reported as the culprit</i>

395
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:47,017
<i>then the person making the report may be
ousted instead for making a false report.</i>

396
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,779
<i>Please think very carefully
before calling in the report.</i>

397
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,609
It has to be an inside job.

398
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,504
[Everyone's suspecting each other
to be the culprit.]

399
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,547
I'm sure someone is behind all this.

400
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:03,907
[No one can be trusted.]

401
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:06,903
<i>Please submit all the necessary items so
that you may participate in the concourse.</i>

402
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:12,055
[What is the hidden secret behind the
mysterious disappearance of Eun Ji?]

403
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:19,850
[Musical Geniuses' Symphony Race- Start.]

404
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,307
There's an instant camera somewhere?

405
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,016
But where did Eun Ji go?

406
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,549
[The unknown mystery surrounding
Eun Ji's disappearance.]

407
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,323
I have to find an instant camera?

408
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:33,817
I have to find something to take
a picture of myself with, right?

409
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:38,152
[The aura of mystery
that surrounds the auditorium.]

410
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:39,855
Doesn't it feel like
there's something going on?

411
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:43,095
- I think it's one of us.
- One of us?

412
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,289
I think someone's been given
a secret mission.

413
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:48,864
There's someone that we're
not aware of.

414
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:53,638
- I think Eun Ji was onto something.
- There's something we're not aware of.

415
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,860
- I think Eun Ji's up to something.
- I bet Eun Ji is actually up to something.

416
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:04,233
We have to find a camera to take a picture
of ourselves and while searching for a camera

417
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:10,285
we also have to find a clue pointing
to who the culprit actually is.

418
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:12,681
Where are those things
usually hidden?

419
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:17,068
- This is my first time being on Running Man.
- But I'm sure you've seen the show before.

420
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,655
[Ji Hoon's following Blank Ji's every move.]

421
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,758
Are you the culprit?

422
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,967
I feel like you're the culprit. You
received a separate mission, didn't you?

423
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,753
No, I didn't.

424
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:30,850
- Kim Ji Hoon, you're making me nervous.
- Come on, help me out.

425
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:35,031
- Why do you keep following me around?
- It's because I don't know what I'm doing.

426
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:37,239
Why are you doing this? You want
to rip off my name tag, don't you?

427
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,847
- No, I'm not going to do that.
- You ousted Eun Ji, didn't you?

428
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,071
How could I?
I was playing the drums.

429
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:47,683
- No, you're hiding something.
- What could I be hiding?

430
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,810
What's that?

431
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,968
[The reporting telephone!]

432
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,415
That must be the phone we use to report
the culprit when we find out who it is.

433
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:04,981
- That's right, the culprit!
- But a false report will get you eliminated.

434
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:08,433
[If a false culprit is reported, then
the one making the report is eliminated.]

435
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,449
I forgot about the culprit!

436
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,163
What?

437
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:15,643
- It's not me.
- What do you have in that bag?

438
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:17,436
No, there's nothing.

439
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:21,982
There's a very high chance that
one of you girls is the culprit.

440
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:26,051
[Kwang Soo suspects one of the girls
to be the culprit who ousted Eun Ji.]

441
00:29:26,052 --> 00:29:29,867
But it really isn't me.
I really like mysteries and such

442
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:34,404
and in most cases, it's the least likely
person that ends up being the culprit.

443
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:37,027
But I really am not the culprit.

444
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:40,417
What are you saying?
That you are or that you aren't?

445
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:42,932
No, it's not me.
I'm not the culprit.

446
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:46,782
[Could Kwang Soo be dumping the suspicion
on Yeon Seo because he's the culprit?]

447
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:51,070
[Or could it be that Yeon Seo is trying to
deter Kwang Soo's suspicions away from her?]

448
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:01,301
[The genius flautist, Ha Ha,
discovers the camera.]

449
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:03,864
[Just then, Gary comes onto the scene.]

450
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:06,850
[Ha Ha is caught by surprise,
and just leaves the camera behind.]

451
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,655
Have you taken any pictures yet?

452
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:18,094
[The two children discover
the camera at the same time.]

453
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,729
[The start of the photo war.]

454
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:28,248
[What's all that noise?]

455
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:36,102

hands every three seconds!]

[There's just one film per camera...]

459
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,922

more than three steps before losing it.]

rough tumble for the camera.]

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,775
[But did the camera
capture Kwang Soo's face?]

464
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,289
What the heck?

465
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,203
I bet there are about four
faces in there.

466
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:31,556
It did capture someone face,
but it's someone else's face.

467
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,512
- Is it my face?
- Who is it?

468
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,445
- It captured someone else's face.
- Who is it?

469
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:37,294
Just rip it up if it's someone
else's face.

470

[The Grasshopper ruined
the Giraffe's picture!]

471
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,899
[But it has to be a solo picture,
and must not have their glasses on.]

472
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:51,664
- You found something, didn't you?
- No, I haven't found anything.

473
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:54,609
You found something, didn't you?
Have you found the camera yet?

474
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,522
- I have no idea where the cameras are.
- I have something to ask you.

475

What were you guys all doing
when you were together earlier?

476

When us girls went out to look
for that admission slip earlier.

477
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:07,830
- We were all on the stage together.
- Not a single one of you went anywhere?

478
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,442
Not even for a moment?

[We were all on stage practicing
playing our instruments...]

480
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:23,003
Oh, I didn't even think of that.
The culprit could've done something then.

481
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:26,686
- Right? Come here, Kwang Soo.
- That one, there.

482
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:28,865

Eun Ji had masterminded everything.]

489
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:56,225
Maybe she secretly brought in another
member of A-Pink or something.

490
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,410
- Son Na Eun?
- I told you that he's weird.

491
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,050
- Maybe you just like Son Na Eun.
- No, that's not it.

492
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:04,962
No, but doesn't it sound likely though?

493
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:08,104
[Just what is the real truth
behind this mystery?]

494
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:11,039
I feel like someone is going to
come after my name tag.

495
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:16,999
[Drummer, Suk Jin, is feeling
weary about what's going on.]

496
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:24,807
[Just then...]

497
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:30,729
[Jae Suk ambushes Big-nose!]

498
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,127
Be quiet.

499
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,571
You have to be quiet.

500
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:39,350
Hurry up and shut the door.

501
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:43,693
You're curious to know what
happened to Eun Ji, aren't you?

502
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:49,566
[Could Jae Suk have done
something to Eun Ji?]

503
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:52,572
I'm curious, too.

504
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,483
What was that all about?

505
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:00,809
[That was just a prank?]

506
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:05,207
I thought you were about to give me
a secret mission or something.

507
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:09,608
[But was that really just
a silly prank?]

508
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:18,146
[Is Jae Suk searching for a clue
or a camera?]

509
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,748
I'm really bad at searching for things.

510
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:24,343
[Seriously?]

511
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:27,444
This is someone's personal locker.
I'm sorry.

512
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,638
[Searching through all the lockers when
the 'R' stickered item is right behind him.]

513
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:34,682
[Just then, Kkuk also enters the room.]

514
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:43,098
[Immediately discovers the stickered item
as soon as Jae Suk leaves the room.]

515
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,337
Fireworks of love?

516
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:49,595
Hey.

517
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:52,012
Jae Suk didn't even see this in
front of him and he just walked out.

518
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,207
Jae Suk... you didn't even
see this here?

519
00:34:56,208 --> 00:35:02,785
[Did he really not see it, or did
he just pretend not to have seen it?]

520
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:04,008
Then let me see it.

521
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,296
What is it that you're after?
Where is Eun Ji?

522
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,842
That's what I'd like to ask you.

523
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:14,913
- Let's look at it together, Jong Kook.
- I looked and there's nothing in here.

524
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:18,018
- Come on, let's look at it together.
- What are you guys doing?

525
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:22,045
- Come on, let's look at it together.
- How could you have missed this?

526
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,818
- Are you being Yoo-ames Bond?
- Let me see.

527
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:27,666
[Is Jae Suk acting
particularly suspicious?]

528
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:33,817
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha
are the only ones in the room.]

529
00:35:34,444 --> 00:35:39,261
[Sheet music to 'Fireworks of Love'...]

530
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:43,204
I don't think this is about finding
some secret numeric code.

531
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,034
[Could this sheet music contain some
clue as to who the culprit is?]

532
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:48,958
Wait, look at these candles!

533
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,373
Wait, this music is for 'Fireworks of love.'

534
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:54,262
[Could these candles contain
some sort of a hidden message?]

535
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,500
Let's try lighting these.

536
00:35:56,501 --> 00:36:00,438
[Lights the candles to see
what may happen...]

537
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:03,798
Wait, why would these candles
be in here?

538
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,103
Jong Kook!

539
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:10,832
[Could it be...]

540
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:16,593
[Shines the candle light
under the sheet music.]

541
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:22,413
- I think I see something.
- Yes, I see it, too!

542
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,949
I think I see something, too.

543
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,688
[The fire from the candle is showing
something on the sheet music!]

544
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,744
[The sheet music shows a
hidden message!]

545
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:42,384
I can't believe this!

546
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:52,642
<i>You are the torch in my heart,
and this life can be so strange.</i>

547
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,771
Okay, you are the torch in my heart,
and this life can be so strange.

548
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:57,714
Okay, let's see what else.

549
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,430
We got it!
I can't believe this!

550
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,603
We got it!

551
00:37:05,604 --> 00:37:08,892
Look at these letters.
The culprit is...

552
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,098
- The culprit is...
- I actually feel a little afraid.

553
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:17,426
[When only the dotted letters
are read...]

554
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:23,573
<i>The culprit is amongst you.</i>

555
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:28,401
- Look at the dotted letters.
- The Culprit is...

556
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:32,686
[The culprit is amongst you.]

557
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:35,684
Wow, we're pretty impressive.

558
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:41,606
[The culprit is amongst you.]

559
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:44,946
No, wait.

560
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:49,251
Wait, I have my finger
on the button right now.

561
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,993
Don't do it.
There's only one film in there.

562
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,769
[Kwang Soo, Ji Hoon, and Suk Jin are
on their second round of camera battle.]

563
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,540
- No one's going to get it like this.
- Get off my back right now.

564
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:02,045
- Don't press the button.
- Okay, I'm not going to run away.

565
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,837
- Let go of me right now.
- You can't press the button.

566
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:07,799
You'll come out looking hideous like that.
Are you trying to take the picture?

567
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:11,591
[Ji Hoon takes the opportunity
to attempt to take the picture.]

568
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:15,279
I'm not trying to do anything,
so you have to be careful right now.

569
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,544
It took the picture!

570
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:26,481
[Oh no... what a waste.]

571
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,669
Are you guys really going
to be like this?

572
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,064
Can't one of us just take
the picture first?

573
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,570
Ji Hoon found it first, so we
should've just let him have it.

574
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:36,665
- That's what I'm telling you.
- What? You were holding onto him.

575
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,538
Your lack of loyalty is...

576
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:44,558
[Ji Hoon pulls himself away from the
Easy Brothers to search on his own.]

577
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:49,006
[Searches through every nook and
cranny to find the clue or the camera.]

578
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:51,793
This is really hard.

579
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,060
The dressing room?

580
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:56,800
[Searches through the dressing room.]

581
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,827
[At last!]

582
00:38:59,828 --> 00:39:04,053
[Another clue!
Finds an 'R' marked cassette player!]

583
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:09,521
[It probably contains a clue
as to who the culprit is...]

584
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,249
Where's the power cord?

585
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,237
[But it doesn't have a power cord,
or any batteries.]

586
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,905
What am I supposed to do with this?

587
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:22,579
You have to give me either
the batteries or the power cord.

588
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:27,438
[Looking at the cassette tape...]

589
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:31,765
[Park Sang Min's
'Road that isn't a road.']

590
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:34,044
Does it mean that this
isn't the road?

591
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:36,136
Does it mean that I shouldn't be here?

592
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,991
A clue.

593
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:42,693
[Blank Ji is also on the search for a
clue pointing to the culprit's identity.]

594
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:48,297
[Get rid of the obstacles.]

595
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,969
Wait, it's a water sprayer.

596
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:54,458
[An 'R' marked water spray bottle...]

597
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,939
Get rid of the obstacle?

598
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:03,170
[Spraying the mirror
with the water spray bottle.]

599
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:14,232
[Oh?
The lines are erasing off!]

600
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:20,753
[Some letters are erasing off,
and some aren't.]

601
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,670
[Wipes off the mirror with a tissue.]

602
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:32,993
[More and more are erasing,
leaving a clearer message.]

603
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:37,316
[The remaining word on the mirror...]

604
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:40,038
Single?

605
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:46,396
[The culprit is single.]

606
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,362
[If the culprit is single...]

607
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:58,637
[Ji Hyo's now on a mission
to search for more clues.]

608
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:07,764
[Discovers another 'R' marked clue!]

609
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:12,324
A list of items to be repaired.

610
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:14,159
[A list of items to be repaired?]

611
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:16,912
What's this supposed to mean?

612
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:19,621
I can't even understand
what this means.

613
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:24,328
[Each item has a letter of the alphabet
and numbers attached to it.]

614
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,929
I think it's seat numbers.
Seat numbers.

615
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,427
[Ji Hyo guesses that the letter and numbers
indicate a certain seat number.]

616
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:41,341
Yes, these are indicating
to a certain seat number.

617
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:46,939
[Our Ace correctly guesses that the
mysterious sequence indicates to a seat.]

618
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,919
[But why is it indicating to these seats?]

619
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:54,587
Wow, unbelievable.

620
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:57,646
I think I get it now.

621
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,747
Wow, unbelievable.

622
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:02,502
[Just what is it that
Blank Ji's figured out?]

623
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:07,253
By any chance, is there a small diagram
of all the seats in the auditorium?

624
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:11,414
[Blank Ji acquires a diagram
of all the seats in the auditorium.]

625
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:15,107
[She's checking all the seats that are
jotted down on the itemized list.]

626
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:29,508
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.
Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

627
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:33,707
[Just what is going on?]

628
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,853
Had Ji Hyo figured out who
the culprit is or something?

629
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,571
[Is the culprit still on the move?]

630
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,491
The culprit ousted someone else?

631
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:47,430
- We can still be ousted?
- Ugh, this is hard.

632
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,408
I wonder if all the girls are in
on some sort of a plan together?

633
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:53,198
Do they have some sort of a plan
to start ousting each other?

634
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,180
It's begun.

635
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:58,672
He's on the move.

636
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:01,224
Even though I've already guessed...

637
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:06,004
Yes, it ultimately comes down to
a battle between you and I.

638
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:10,195
I will catch you in the end.
You just wait and see.

639
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,140
[Culprit or not, this Yoo-varotti
is busy playing the rusty horn.]

640
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,377
[Suk Jin is drawn by the sound of the
horn and comes upon the stage.]

641
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,431
What are you doing? You heard
the announcement, didn't you?

642
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,785
- You heard the announcement, right?
- You know of Ji Hyo's elimination?

643
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:42,549
He's getting closer.

644
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:45,419
Are you shooting a movie by yourself?

645
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,925
- You don't know what's going on.
- Don't act like you're Sherlock Holmes.

646
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:52,771
- Don't think that you're Sherlock Holmes.
- You can be my Watson.

647
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,716
- You know who Watson is, don't you?
- That's not bad.

648
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:00,254
Okay, I'll be Watson.

649
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:03,509
You seem excited about it.
You like being Watson, don't you?

650
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:05,518
- Watson is still a major character.
- Okay, deal.

651
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,623
- Sherlock.
- Watson.

652
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:10,679
[Yoo-Sherlock and Ji-Watson.
Middle-aged detectives.]

653
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,170
Who could've ousted Ji Hyo?

654
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,872
- Oh Yeon Seo.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

655
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:17,293
- Or Jung Eun Ji.
- It's one of those three.

656
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:21,158
I bet we're going to shock everyone.

657
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,570
- Yes, we're going to shock everyone.
- We're above everyone else's thinking.

658
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:28,710
Yes, sound the celebratory
music, Sherlock.

659
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,268
[Jong Kook discovers the
'R' marked camera.]

660
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:44,668
[The goal of all the musical geniuses
here is to participate in the concourse.]

661
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:48,017
[Jong Kook's admission form
is nearly complete.]

662
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:53,289
[But this isn't the end of it- He must also
find sheet music of Beethoven's sympathy.]

663
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,163
I look too excited in the photo.

664
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:59,206
[Yeon Seo also succeeds in getting
a picture of herself.]

665
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,413
I feel like I'm going to have a
heart attack trying to take this picture.

666
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,464
Do you see how my hands
are shaking?

667
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:06,651
[It's a place full of high energy and fear.]

668
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:09,718
I look like I'm being
chased after by something.

669
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,548
[She just needs to find Beethoven's music
in order to be able to participate.]

670
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:16,615
[But she must not get ousted by
the culprit before that happens...]

671
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:20,963
But you can't be going around
blabbering your mouth about this, okay?

672
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:25,187
I found this cassette nearby a radio.

673
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,691
[Ji Hoon shares his hint with Kwang Soo
when he's unable to figure it out on his own.]

674
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,595
I wasn't able to play this on the radio
but the title of the song is written on here.

675
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:34,929
[Shares the hint with Kwang Soo.]

676
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,392
Could this title be pointing to Gary?

677
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:39,569
['A road that isn't a road'...
could it mean Gary?]

678
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:44,322
Here it is!

679
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,343
[Gary discovers a camera.]

680
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:51,417
[But now that we think about it, Gary's
been going around on his own today...]

681
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:56,947
[Meanwhile, Ji Hoon and Kwang Soo are
busy trying to figure out the hint.]

682
00:45:56,948 --> 00:45:59,722
[Turning the tape around in the cassette.]

683
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:06,382
[Oh? What are those
white lines on the tape?]

684
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:12,624
1m?

685
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,973
Doesn't it just mean that we've
turned 1m of the tape?

686
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:21,781
Maybe you're right.
But why would it indicate that?

687
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,714
[The white lines are still being spotted.]

688
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:28,797
[And 2m...]

689
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:32,075
[What could these mean?]

690
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:35,956
Wow, you're really smart.

691
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:38,818
[Ji Hoon's pulls out the length of the tape.]

692
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,897
Maybe it's telling us to
use it like a measuring tape.

693
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,708
[Thinking closely, the white lines are
indicating a length of 10cm.]

694
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:54,086
Yes, that's a nice picture.

695
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:55,662
[Gary successfully
takes a picture of himself.]

696
00:46:56,442 --> 00:47:00,769
[Hurries to complete the
admission form.]

697
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:10,739
[Who could that be?]

698
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:26,378
<i>Gary, out.</i>

699
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:30,285
[People are being eliminated
one by one.]

700
00:47:30,286 --> 00:47:31,841
Wow, I seriously am so lost.

701
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:36,680
No way that Ji Hyo would
get ousted so quickly.

702
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,153
[Could this be the work of someone
who's already been ousted?]

703
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:42,256
[Or could the culprit still be
amongst us?]

704
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,906
- Did Yeon Seo get her picture?
- Yes, she did.

705
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,955
Kwang Soo got one,
and Dong Hoon got one too.

706
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,760
- Gary got one too.
- He had found one too, right?

707
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:01,145
- Gary had gotten one, too.
- Then only those with a picture are ousted?

708
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:07,199
- But falsely reporting someone means...
- Yes, that can get you ousted, too.

709
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,307
- But I don't think Gary reported anyone in.
- I know, but there aren't enough clues.

710
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:15,659
I can't figure out who the culprit is.
Gary played a prank earlier like he was...

711
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:24,350
[Automatically raises her hand to
hit the person behind her in response.]

712
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:29,813
- You almost got smacked in the face.
- No, it was just automatic reflex.

713
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:31,890
Maybe there's a reason why
she hasn't been ousted yet.

714
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:34,068
Doesn't having my name tag ripped
off mean that I'm ousted?

715
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:36,626
I've already been around here
several times.

716
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,736
I can't believe that I'm back
in here again.

717
00:48:39,737 --> 00:48:41,904
[Yoo-Sherlock is just aimlessly walking
around the same space in circles.]

718
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:50,859
[Discovers some sheet music sitting
on tip of the piano.]

719
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,446
Was this here before?

720
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,552
[And when he lifts up the lid
to reveal the keyboard...]

721
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:58,970
The dressing room?

722
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:05,702
What does this mean?
Wait, does this song mean something?

723
00:49:05,703 --> 00:49:08,481
[This has to be some sort of a clue
indicating to who the culprit is...]

724
00:49:10,508 --> 00:49:14,876
[Yoo-Sherlock attempts to play
the song on the sheet music.]

725
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:28,302
[Numbers on the sides of the keys!]

726
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:30,486
This really is something.

727
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:34,458
Zero.

728
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,508
Zero.

729
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:38,372
Two.

730
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:43,717
0021?
What does '0021' mean?

731
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,271
Wow, seriously.

732
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:57,928
[Must mean that I need to go
to the dressing room.]

733
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:02,117
[Jae Suk hurries to rush over
to the dressing room.]

734
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:06,653
- Why don't we all try to figure it out?
- But I think... okay, I will.

735
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:10,783
I will work with you guys on this,
but I think the culprit purposely did it.

736
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:16,015
Like this?

737
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:25,043
Be careful, Dong Hoon almost got
smacked a little while ago.

738
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:27,599
He almost got smacked in the face.

739
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,289
[Was it just a joke or a part
of his plans?]

740
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:33,536
I'll just figure this out on my own.

741
00:50:33,537 --> 00:50:37,775
[The clue that Yeon Seo found is
a drawing of some sort?]

742
00:50:37,776 --> 00:50:40,401
I thought of Ha Ha when
I saw this picture.

743
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:42,316
[Playground indicates to kiddo Ha Ha?]

744
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,670
How many kids are there
in the picture?

745
00:50:45,194 --> 00:50:48,058
Let's count to see how many boys
and girls there are.

746
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,662
[This picture definitely has a clue
as to who the culprit is...]

747
00:50:50,663 --> 00:50:53,217
- Do you think the picture means something?
- Come on.

748
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,822
You said yourself that you have read
over a hundred mystery books.

749
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:59,154
- See if you can figure it out.
- Murder mysteries are what I read.

750
00:50:59,155 --> 00:51:01,212
Why are you reading things like that?

751
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:03,751
So I'm not good at finding
hidden meanings.

752
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:07,513
- I wish I could find another hint.
- What's this?

753
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,223
What's this?

754
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:12,035
I see an instrument here.

755
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,146
Look, here's an instrument.

756
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,496
[This instrument is...]

757
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:23,250
- Isn't that a violin?
- It's a violin.

758
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:26,390
- Isn't that a violin?
- Who played the violin earlier?

759
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:35,208
[If it's a violin,
then it's Kwang Soo...]

760
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:38,513
Who played the violin earlier?

761
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:42,255
That's you.

762
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:45,987
- It was you, wasn't it?
- Are you confessing?

763
00:51:45,988 --> 00:51:47,701
It's you.

764
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:52,049
I'm not the culprit!

765
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:56,788
[Just then, he runs into
Jong Kook outside.]

766
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,688
[Kwang Soo is forced to flee.]

767
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:02,510
- What is it?
- Kwang Soo is the culprit!

768
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:05,200
- What is it?
- Jong Kook, I've been wronged!

769
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:10,623
[Kwang Soo on the run,
and those in pursuit.]

770
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,143
What is it?

771
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:14,318
- It's not me!
- What is it? Tell me!

772
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,237
- Jong Kook! You have to catch him!
- It really isn't me.

773
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:20,991
- Jong Kook, it really isn't me.
- Then stop running away.

774
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:24,349
- You believe that it isn't me, don't you?
- Let's just catch him and talk.

775
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,750
- You can't eliminate me right now.
- Okay, but what is it?

776
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,576
[Violinist Kwang Soo is surrounded.]

777
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:32,456
- Are you the culprit?
- No, it's not me.

778
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:36,496
- I want to trust you, but I'm not sure.
- It can't be me because...

779
00:52:36,497 --> 00:52:39,892
- Why did you run away?
- Because you were trying to attack me.

780
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:42,330
- Why did you run if it's not you?
- You need to calm Yeon Seo down.

781
00:52:42,331 --> 00:52:44,303
- Why, what is it?
- The thing is...

782
00:52:44,304 --> 00:52:47,760
He found the clue, but it
ended up being his instrument.

783
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:51,046
Then could it be a
smaller version of the cello?

784
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:52,902
- Yes, it could be the cello.
- Cello.

785
00:52:52,903 --> 00:53:00,530
[But the cello would mean...
that it's Jong Kook.]

786
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:05,823
Okay, even I admit that
it was a picture of the violin.

787
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:08,416
- It was the violin?
- You know that it's not me, right?

788
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,537
- No, I don't know!
- You have to believe me.

789
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:13,272
- Why would I...
- Tell me what's going on here.

790
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,990
I saw a hidden violin picture
in the painting.

791
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,853
- There was a hidden violin in the picture.
- Yeon Seo.

792
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:23,340
- Yeah?
- Where are you going?

793
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:27,314
- Bye.
- Yeon Seo, you know it isn't me, right?

794
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:29,090
[Where is Yeon Seo suddenly going?]

795
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:32,103
Don't you think that it would be too weird
for me to turn out to be the culprit?

796
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:37,183
- I have no idea what you are.
- I'm just a clueless violinist.

797
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:40,226
I'm just a simple genius violinist.

798
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:45,092
You're 99% an idiot, but there are
times when you're like a genius.

799
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:47,465
- That's what scares me.
- I'm that 99% today.

800
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:53,206
[Jae Suk goes down to the dressing room
following the clue that he just found.]

801
00:53:56,153 --> 00:54:02,940
[But... all the doors are locked.]

802
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:09,433
[A secret code is needed to
unlock these doors.]

803
00:54:09,434 --> 00:54:12,359
[Could it be...]

804
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:23,943
[The numbers hidden between
the piano keys.]

805
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:33,636
Ugh, you dummy!

806
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,121
Ugh, you dummy.
You deserve to be beat.

807
00:54:36,122 --> 00:54:38,951
Ugh, you dummy!

808
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:48,353
[If it's not 0021...]

809
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:54,502
[It's not 0012 either.]

810
00:54:54,503 --> 00:55:01,072
[1002 unlocks the door!]

811
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:05,206
[Finally unlocks the door to
walk into the dressing room...]

812
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:08,337
[That's...]

813
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:15,281
[Ousted Eun Ji's name tag!]

814
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:22,768
[And a piece of string?
What could this mean?]

815
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:29,412
[Eun Ji... could your secret be...]

816
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,654
Jung Eun Ji.

817
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:35,045
It's has to be
Kim Jong Kook and Jung Eun Ji.

818
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:38,851
[Ji-Watson guesses that Jung Eun Ji and
Kim Jong Kook must be working together.]

819
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:41,920
Being alone is making me feel nervous.

820
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,983
[Suk Jin is separated from
all the other musicians.]

821
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:50,010
Being alone is making me
feel really uneasy.

822
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:52,530
[Just like he predicted, could
some force be closing in on him?]

823
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:55,894
I'm suspicious of Jong Kook.

824
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,015
[Must hurry up and find the culprit.]

825
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:01,584
What's this?

826
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:10,163
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

827
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:15,181
[Musical geniuses are disappearing
one by one without a trace.]

828
00:56:15,182 --> 00:56:20,498
[No one can be trusted.]

829
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:23,335
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

830
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,609
I'm in trouble.

831
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:34,523
[Just then... sudden footsteps
are heard out in the hallway.]

832
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:42,349
[The sounds of the footsteps
are getting even closer.]

833
00:56:46,172 --> 00:56:52,177
[The knocking on the door is
making his heart constrict.]

834
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:57,479
[Who could be on the other
side of the door?]

835
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:05,405
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

836
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:08,196
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

837
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:12,026
[The musicians are being eliminated
at an even faster rate.]

838
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:19,989
[Just who in the world is
the real culprit?]

839
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:31,022
Jae Suk...

840
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:34,484
[With Jae Suk's elimination, the musicians
are thrown into an even bigger state of fear.]

841
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,216
Jong Kook, the truth is...

842
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:39,658
- I'm not sure how much I should tell you...
- Just tell me.

843
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,910
But those two married men
were very suspicious of you.

844
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:46,165
And now, both of them have
been eliminated.

845
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:49,989
[Those who were suspicious of Jong Kook
all have been eliminated?]

846
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,911
Why would I?
I've been with you guys all along.

847
00:57:52,912 --> 00:57:55,575
That's what I told them too.
I told them that it isn't you.

848
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:58,012
- Not when you've worked so hard.
- It isn't me.

849
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,621
- You worked so hard with me.
- It really isn't me.

850
00:58:00,622 --> 00:58:04,703
If you end up being the culprit, I think
I'll be mad at you for like two weeks.

851
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:08,562
- I'm being serious.
- Then call in and tell them that it's me.

852
00:58:08,563 --> 00:58:11,292
- I'm serious.
- No, you go first.

853
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:15,562
- No, tell them that it's me.
- I insist that you go first.

854
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:25,832
[Must find the clues to report the culprit
before they all end up being eliminated.]

855
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,197
Is the piano locked?

856
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,310
[Ji Hoon's on the hunt to
search for more clues.]

857
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:38,410
[Discovers an 'R marked box!]

858
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:41,245
What's this?

859
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:46,550
What's this?

860
00:58:46,551 --> 00:58:52,428
[Inside the box...
is a recorder and a ribbon?]

861
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,548
Will the culprit come out
if I start playing it?

862
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:59,541
[The culprit isn't a cobra.]

863
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:06,256
[Carefully looks over the recorder.]

864
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:09,018
This mystery is really difficult
to solve.

865
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:15,657
[And the mysterious strand of ribbon.]

866
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,371
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

867
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:21,332
What have they done to
this ribbon?

868
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,650
I have no idea what this means.

869
00:59:23,651 --> 00:59:27,063
[Random pen markings on the ribbon.]

870
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:40,892
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

871
00:59:40,893 --> 00:59:43,810
Ugh, Running Man is seriously annoying.
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

872
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:46,492
Why are these writers so clever?

873
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:52,360
[He starts to wrap the strand of
ribbon around the recorder.]

874
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:55,046
This is unbelievable.

875
00:59:55,868 --> 01:00:00,678
[Just what is written on the ribbon strand?]

876
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:11,590
[How can this be?]

877
01:00:12,678 --> 01:00:14,776
First...

878
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:19,383
First, the cassette tape said
something about 2m.

879
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:23,255
I measured it against Kwang Soo earlier,
and it fit Kwang Soo's height perfectly.

880
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:27,901
[Ji Hoon measured Kwang Soo's height
with the tape measure earlier.]

881
01:00:27,902 --> 01:00:29,506
It's a perfect fit.

882
01:00:29,507 --> 01:00:31,844
Then you're telling me
that I'm the culprit?

883
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:34,529
[Then could the tape measure have
indicated to the culprit's height?]

884
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:42,167
And it was really weird that Kwang Soo saw
the violin in the picture when I couldn't.

885
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:46,274
Because we couldn't see the violin
no matter how closely we looked at it.

886
01:00:47,668 --> 01:00:51,133
[Just what is the hidden meaning
behind this picture?]

887
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:54,461
- Isn't that a violin?
- Who played the violin earlier?

888
01:00:54,462 --> 01:00:59,624
[The picture that no one else could see...
Was Kwang Soo playing a trick?]

889
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:04,777
[Okay, Kwang Soo.]

890
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,416
- Ji Hoon.
- Yes?

891
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:10,536
- Come here, Ji Hoon. Let's end this.
- Let's report this, and end it.

892
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:12,812
- Who are we reporting?
- Let's each report someone and end this.

893
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:15,129
- Okay, let's do that.
- Let's go in the order of age.

894
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,272
- Okay, let's do that.
- Then the youngest one can go first.

895
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:21,674
Since we're doing it in order of age, let's
start with the youngest person here.

896
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:23,530
Who are you going to report?

897
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:30,523
- I have a feeling that it's Kwang Soo.
- I also think that it's Kwang Soo.

898
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:32,579
[Ji Hoon's convinced that it's Kwang Soo.]

899
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,710
When I piece together
all the clues that I've found...

900
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:38,843
Kwang Soo is the most likely suspect.

901
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:44,332
- Then should I just call in the report?
- Yes.

902
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:49,517
Don't push him into doing it.
It may not be Kwang Soo.

903
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:52,596
- Should I just guess? Just call it in?
- Yeah.

904
01:01:52,597 --> 01:01:55,695
- Just end the show right here?
- It really doesn't matter to me.

905
01:01:55,696 --> 01:01:58,014
We can start the eight o'clock news
a little early tonight.

906
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:01,673
Let's see what happens.

907
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:08,769
[Ji Hoon lifts up the telephone receiver.]

908
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:13,464
I really want to find out.

909
01:02:13,465 --> 01:02:15,263
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

910
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:19,280
- Yes, who's this?
- This is Kim Ji Hoon.

911
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,174
- Mr. Kim Ji Hoon?
- Yes.

912
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:23,809
[The call has been made, and
now it's time to make the report.]

913
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,590
- I think the culprit is...
- Yes, who's the culprit?

914
01:02:28,475 --> 01:02:33,781
[The culprit is...]

915
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:36,014
Lee Kwang Soo!

916
01:02:36,015 --> 01:02:42,111
[The culprit is Lee Kwang Soo.]

917
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:48,393
[The height of 2m.]

918
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:52,380
[Single and is a violinist.]

919
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:58,387
[Could Kwang Soo really be the one who
wrote the symphony of elimination?]

920
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,446
Lee Kwang Soo!

921
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:05,901
[Lee Kwang Soo is the culprit!]

922
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:09,174
[An alarm to sound the report.]

923
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:16,808
[An onslaught of Running
Special Task Force.]

924
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:24,516
What's that?

925
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:27,249
[Suspect, Lee Kwang Soo.]

926
01:03:28,823 --> 01:03:31,398
[Reporter, Kim Ji Hoon.]

927
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,593
[If it's the right report, then culprit
Kwang Soo will be apprehended.]

928
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:37,862
[But if the report is wrong, then Ji Hoon will
be apprehended for making a false report.]

929
01:03:37,863 --> 01:03:42,408
[Will it be Kwang Soo or Ji Hoon?]

930
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:48,422
[The special task force's target
is Ji Hoon!]

931
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:58,566
[The whole task force moves in to
capture one false reporter!]

932
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:01,454
- Wait.
- You must've made a false report.

933
01:04:01,455 --> 01:04:04,376
I didn't do anything that wrong.

934
01:04:06,738 --> 01:04:09,262
You are under arrest
for calling in a false report.

935
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,633
Can you please let me go
just this once?

936
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:17,514
[Kim Ji Hoon, out.]

937
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,007
What is this?

938
01:04:20,008 --> 01:04:22,677
Ji Hoon, you said you were sure
that it was Kwang Soo.

939
01:04:22,678 --> 01:04:26,385
[Kwang Soo isn't the culprit.]

940
01:04:26,386 --> 01:04:27,981
I had so much evidence
indicating that it's Kwang Soo.

941
01:04:27,982 --> 01:04:31,663
[Ji Hoon was convinced that it was Kwang Soo.
Then did he not correctly solve the clues?]

942
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:33,687
Do you normally come in a
large group like this?

943
01:04:35,214 --> 01:04:39,131
<i>Kim Ji Hoon, out.</i>

944
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:41,808
Who did he report?
Did he report me?

945
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,898
[Thus, it's been proven that
Kwang Soo isn't the culprit.]

946
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:49,575
I had so much evidence
indicating that it's Kwang Soo.

947
01:04:53,702 --> 01:04:56,059
What is it?
Is someone in there?

948
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,086
Is someone in there?

949
01:05:01,555 --> 01:05:04,604
[Could the culprit be...]

950
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:08,318
<i>- These letters?
- Look at the dotted letters.</i>

951
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,752
<i>- The culprit is...
- Eliminate the obstacle?</i>

952
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:15,308
[The clue that Ji Hyo figured out...]

953
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:22,685
[When her clue was solved...]

954
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,719
[The culprit is single.]

955
01:05:26,315 --> 01:05:27,622
What's this?

956
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,450
[The picture clue
that Kwang Soo figured out.]

957
01:05:30,451 --> 01:05:34,447
[The string instrument
that looked like a violin.]

958
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:36,237
Who played the violin earlier?

959
01:05:36,238 --> 01:05:39,967
[Kwang Soo was suspected for
having solved the mysterious clue...]

960
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,369
[The tape hint that Kwang Soo and
Ji Hoon solved together.]

961
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:49,184
[The white markings that indicated
every 10cm.]

962
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:52,922
[And the 2m marking at the end
of those white markings.]

963
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:57,942
[But there's a small secret that
Ji Hoon and Kwang Soo had missed.]

964
01:05:57,943 --> 01:06:01,275
[Number, 178, was written onto the tape.]

965
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:05,734
[And the recorder and the ribbon clue
that only Ji Hoon was aware of.]

966
01:06:05,735 --> 01:06:08,680
[A word was created when the ribbon
was wrapped around the recorder.]

967
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:10,781
It's a male.

968
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:12,861
The culprit is a male.

969
01:06:12,862 --> 01:06:14,796
[The culprit is a male.]

970
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:25,923
[The four separate clues indicating
to the identity of the culprit.]

971
01:06:25,924 --> 01:06:29,826
The culprit is amongst you.

972
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:32,961
[Then who could the culprit be?]

973
01:06:34,221 --> 01:06:36,887
[The moment that Ji Hoon is taken away
for having made a false report...]

974
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:39,771
[Jong Kook suddenly springs into action.]

975
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:44,781
Is someone in there?
Wait a second!

976
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:46,555
Wait!

977
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:57,794
[Twenty years ago]

978
01:06:57,795 --> 01:07:00,729
<i>The first place winner of the
Young Running Concourse Competition is...</i>

979
01:07:01,378 --> 01:07:03,786
<i>Kim Jong Kook!</i>

980
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:08,980
[Other young musicians'
jealousy and envy...]

981
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:11,899
[The genius cellist who celebrated
the glory of his victory...]

982
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,267
[But after the moment of his victory...]

983
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:17,176
<i>Did you forget everything
that you learned yesterday?</i>

984
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:25,942
[The pressures and the expectations that he
received from everyone regarding his music.]

985
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:30,578
[He slowly starts to crumble...]

986
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,126
<i>Ma'am, I think we need to talk.</i>

987
01:07:39,107 --> 01:07:41,900
<i>Ma'am, Jong Kook's skills
and talent...</i>

988
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:47,317
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think
Jong Kook has real talent to be a cellist.</i>

989
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:50,382
<i>I don't think he'll make it into
the upcoming musical concourse.</i>

990
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:54,149
<i>I think it would be better for him
to just play cello as a hobby.</i>

991
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,958
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

992
01:07:55,959 --> 01:08:00,039
[Twenty years later.]

993
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,675
[R Corporate Marketing Team.]

994
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:06,818
[Jong Kook gives up being a cellist
to work in the concert marketing team.]

995
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:11,128
2014...
The First Running Man Music Concourse?

996
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:14,482
They're actually inviting me?

997
01:08:15,193 --> 01:08:17,969
Ugh, back in the day...

998
01:08:18,748 --> 01:08:19,927
What's this?

999
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:24,956
<i>The genius pianist who's breaking all
musical records on national stage?</i>

1000
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:28,369
<i>Jung Eun Ji, with the voice of an
angel sings on national stage?</i>

1001
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,328
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, touching our hearts
with his angelic voice...</i>

1002
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,506
Legendary Gary,
and Oh Yeon Seo, the genius harpist?

1003
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:38,233
Ji Suk Jin, Song Ji Hyo,
and Flautist Ha Ha?

1004
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:42,850
Ugh, seriously!
They were nothing back in the day!

1005
01:08:45,151 --> 01:08:46,862
Okay, fine.

1006
01:08:46,863 --> 01:08:49,237
I'll go and participate.

1007
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,705
I'll go and destroy every
single one of you.

1008
01:08:51,706 --> 01:08:55,837
It seems you don't know this,
but I'm the real genius.

1009
01:08:56,313 --> 01:08:59,570
Challenge accepted.

1010
01:08:59,605 --> 01:09:02,820
[To deter others from participating
in the concourse as an act of revenge...]

1011
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:06,239
[Jong Kook went through
meticulous planning and preparations.]

1012
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:10,883
[Set up for elimination of the other
musicians are now completed.]

1013
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:13,524
You all just wait and see.

1014
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:16,251
You'll be quite surprised.

1015
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:20,493
<i>You will be given ten minutes.</i>

1016
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,053
[Four hours ago.]

1017
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:26,016
[Girls' mission- Find the hidden blank
admission slips outside the auditorium.]

1018
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:30,988
[Bring back the slips within ten minutes to
be able to participate in the concourse.]

1019
01:09:30,989 --> 01:09:34,219
- Okay, go!
- How can it be all three girls?

1020
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:37,039
- I wonder if they'll be given a mission.
- We'll be back!

1021
01:09:37,703 --> 01:09:39,209
<i>Suk Jin, can you put your
pants back on?</i>

1022
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:47,455
[While the girls were busy trying to
find the hidden admission slips...]

1023
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:56,657
[Jung Eun Ji enters the room that
Jong Kook has set up.]

1024
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,437
I don't even see anything.

1025
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:07,723
[Discovers the admission slip that Jong Kook
placed in the room the night before.]

1026
01:10:10,258 --> 01:10:11,681
This must be it.

1027
01:10:13,124 --> 01:10:15,319
[Sits down on the seat unaware
that she's now taped down to the chair.]

1028
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,186
[As soon as she's ready to head back to
the auditorium with the admission slip...]

1029
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:24,567
[Her name tag is ripped off just as
Jong Kook had planned!]

1030
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,486
[Jung Eun Ji, out!]

1031
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:34,568
Did I just get ousted?

1032
01:10:42,897 --> 01:10:44,679
Who did this?

1033
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:51,386
[Jung Eun Ji is no longer able
to participate in the concourse.]

1034
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:57,068
<i>Jung Eun Ji, out!</i>

1035
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,960
- Someone's been ousted?
- Eun Ji's been ousted?

1036
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:04,406
[Throws the six men into
a state of confusion.]

1037
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:08,429
[And... one man is left laughing
to himself.]

1038
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,747
[It's time to get started.]

1039
01:11:11,596 --> 01:11:18,426
[While Ji Hyo was busy deciphering the code
hidden in the seating chart...]

1040
01:11:20,028 --> 01:11:22,790
[Jong Kook had been watching
her the entire time.]

1041
01:11:23,736 --> 01:11:25,827
[Writing something out with her fingers.]

1042
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,104
Does it say 'Kim'?

1043
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:32,757
[The mark on the fourteenth
seat on the chart.]

1044
01:11:32,758 --> 01:11:34,672
[When looked upside down with
all the dots connected.]

1045
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:39,178
[Kim]

1046
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:42,772
Why are you so suspicious of me?
You're always so suspicious of me.

1047
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:47,069
It's you, isn't it?

1048
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:51,120
[Ji Hyo, it's time to end this.]

1049
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:53,839
[Doesn't my hand look sticky to you?]

1050
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:57,636
[Starts the elimination with Ji Hyo,
who solved the most number of clues.]

1051
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,598
[Pianist, Ji Hyo,
is no longer able to participate.]

1052
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:09,388
[Who should I eliminate next?]

1053
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:15,570
[His next target is Gary, who almost
has his admission slip completed.]

1054
01:12:16,329 --> 01:12:20,535
[Notifies him of a crucial clue...]

1055
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,767
[Kim]

1056
01:12:21,768 --> 01:12:24,610
[Springs out of his seat to
alert the rest of the members.]

1057
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:26,914
[However!]

1058
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:32,899
[Gary's also no longer able to participate.]

1059
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:38,367
[After Kwang Soo discovers the hidden
violin picture in the painting.]

1060
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,657
- Why did you run away if you're not it?
- Can you calm Yeon Seo down?

1061
01:12:40,658 --> 01:12:41,708
What's this all about?

1062
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:45,224
[Jong Kook's unaware of what's going on
because he was too busy ousting Gary.]

1063
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:48,361
He found that violin himself when
no one else could see it in the painting.

1064
01:12:48,362 --> 01:12:51,242
[Violin?]

1065
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:54,072
[A dead stare.]

1066
01:12:54,073 --> 01:12:57,527
[Then maybe it's
a smaller version of a cello?]

1067
01:12:57,877 --> 01:13:02,195
[The brief moment of uncertainty...]

1068
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:06,630
- Okay, I admit that it's a violin.
- Where did you even see it?

1069
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:08,439
It was definitely a violin.

1070
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:11,289
[Fortunately escapes his moment of
danger thanks to Kwang Soo.]

1071
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:16,853
[Big-nose is now starting to
get suspicious of Jong Kook.]

1072
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:20,325
[And Jong Kook's been listening in
on Big-nose's self-muttering.]

1073
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,188
[The moment Big-nose opens the door...]

1074
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:27,851
[Kim Jong Kook]

1075
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:32,658
I knew it!
I knew it was you!

1076
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:35,845
[Ji Suk Jin is eliminated
from participating.]

1077
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:39,413
[Jae Suk gains access to the dressing room
with the lock code that he found.]

1078
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,733
[Enters the room that Eun Ji
had been eliminated from.]

1079
01:13:41,734 --> 01:13:44,729
[Just then, Jong Kook happens to
discover Jae Suk in the dressing room.]

1080
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:46,286
It's Eun Ji's name tag.

1081
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:48,155
[And also discovers the cello string,
which is a definitive evidence.]

1082
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:52,642
What are you doing?

1083
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:56,122
What are you doing in there?
I saw you going in there.

1084
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,220
- What do I do?
- Hurry up and open the door.

1085
01:14:00,221 --> 01:14:03,737
- Seriously, what do you want?
- What are you doing in there?

1086
01:14:04,209 --> 01:14:07,180
- I'm trying to find a camera.
- What are you doing in there?

1087
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:10,982
Let me out of here.
I need to go find a camera.

1088
01:14:10,983 --> 01:14:14,005
- Why are you coming in here?
- Why can't I come in here?

1089
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:16,309
- Why are you trying to get out?
- Let's go talk outside.

1090
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,659
The painting had Kwang Soo's
violin in it.

1091
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,621
Isn't this a violin string?
Come on, let's go take a look.

1092
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:23,794
[Jae Suk walks out with
his trust still in Jong Kook.]

1093
01:14:25,643 --> 01:14:27,682
It's a cello string.

1094
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:28,986
[It's a cello string.]

1095
01:14:28,987 --> 01:14:31,846
[Yoo Jae Suk-
eliminated from the competition.]

1096
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:34,308
- Ugh, I'm so fired up.
- You're not going anywhere.

1097
01:14:35,014 --> 01:14:38,741
Because I'm going to stop every single
one of you from getting up on that stage.

1098
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:41,084
Just like this.

1099
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,073
Who else is left?

1100
01:14:49,483 --> 01:14:51,151
Ha Dong Hoon.

1101
01:14:51,152 --> 01:14:53,493
Lee Kwang Soo.
Kim Ji Hoon.

1102
01:14:53,968 --> 01:14:55,613
Oh Yeon Seo.

1103
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:57,699
Only four more left to eliminate.

1104
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:04,804
You guys could never even compare
to the talent that I had.

1105
01:15:06,832 --> 01:15:12,585
[Exactly according to Jong Kook's plan,
Ji Hoon's eliminated for false reporting.]

1106
01:15:12,586 --> 01:15:15,758
[Ha ha ha... now there are only three.]

1107
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:20,059
[While everyone's thrown into
a state of confusion.]

1108
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:24,089
[His breakout performance.]

1109
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,595
[Ha Ha falls right into his trap.]

1110
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:29,024
Is someone in there?
Wait!

1111
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,569
[Comes up from behind...]

1112
01:15:35,101 --> 01:15:38,784
[Ha Ha is eliminated from participating.]

1113
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:43,795
[Two birds with one stone.
Now the only ones left are...]

1114
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:51,183
<i>Ha Ha, out.</i>

1115
01:15:51,906 --> 01:15:55,986
<i>Ha Ha, out.</i>

1116
01:15:57,033 --> 01:16:00,077
What the heck?
Did they really call someone in?

1117
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:04,313
[The only ones now left are
Lee Kwang Soo and Oh Yeon Seo.]

1118
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:11,019
[And the real culprit, Kim Jong Kook-
Only these last three people.]

1119
01:16:11,784 --> 01:16:14,142
<i>Who do I still have left?</i>

1120
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,609
<i>Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1121
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,481
<i>Oh Yeon Seo.</i>

1122
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:21,777
It's time for me to make my move.

1123
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,330
It's time to start the concourse...
all by myself.

1124
01:16:27,331 --> 01:16:32,577
[Time to start the concourse...
on my own.]

1125
01:16:32,578 --> 01:16:34,274
Kwang Soo!

1126
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:36,096
Lee Kwang Soo.

1127
01:16:36,097 --> 01:16:38,790
[Kwang Soo is his next target!]

1128
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:47,055
[Yeon Seo finds another clue.]

1129
01:16:50,324 --> 01:16:51,891
Kwang Soo.

1130
01:16:51,892 --> 01:16:56,956
[Desperately calls out Kwang Soo's name.]

1131
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:02,425
Kwang Soo.

1132
01:17:02,426 --> 01:17:07,320
[Instead of Kwang Soo...
it'll have to be Yeon Seo.]

1133
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:08,655
What else did you find?

1134
01:17:08,656 --> 01:17:10,459
Is it a clue pointing to Kwang Soo?

1135
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:14,883
[It seems that Kwang Soo's still
unaware of the culprit's identity.]

1136
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,477
[What is this?]

1137
01:17:20,478 --> 01:17:24,076
[Clue- A painting of a starry evening.]

1138
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:29,975
[What could this mean?]

1139
01:17:33,156 --> 01:17:35,937
Are you sure that you're
not the culprit?

1140
01:17:35,938 --> 01:17:37,874
Why do you think that I'm
the culprit?

1141
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:42,406
I don't think Kwang Soo's the culprit
because he would just be too obvious.

1142
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:51,355
- Jong Kook, you don't have to get up.
- Why not?

1143
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:54,153
- Because you scare me.
- Why?

1144
01:17:54,154 --> 01:17:57,534
- Did you feel scared of Kwang Soo, too?
- Kwang Soo?

1145
01:17:57,535 --> 01:18:01,171
Yes, I guess so.
But Kwang Soo kept avoiding me.

1146
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:06,962
[Flips over the picture frame.]

1147
01:18:08,553 --> 01:18:10,279
What's this?

1148
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,132
Musical bars?

1149
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:18,123
Yes, that's what this is.

1150
01:18:18,124 --> 01:18:20,594
This is sheet music.

1151
01:18:22,626 --> 01:18:25,799
Yeon Seo, please stop doing that.
You're starting to offend me.

1152
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,136
- Why are you doing this, Jong Kook?
- What are you doing?

1153
01:18:28,558 --> 01:18:31,907
- This won't do.
- Please don't come any closer.

1154
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:34,240
[No, this won't do.]

1155
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:37,454
- Seriously, Jong Kook!
- Why are you avoiding me?

1156
01:18:37,455 --> 01:18:41,985
- Why are you avoiding me like this?
- You know I can't beat you physically!

1157
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:45,924
- Are you sure that it's me?
- Yes.

1158
01:18:45,925 --> 01:18:48,622
- Why?
- Call it female intuition.

1159
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:52,147
- There's no such a thing.
- Why do you keep coming closer?

1160
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:58,178
[What's the correlation between the painting
and the sheet music on the back?]

1161
01:19:00,338 --> 01:19:03,656
Wasn't this sheet placed in the back for
me to put it up against the painting?

1162
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:06,377
Could these stars mean something?

1163
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:15,220
[Could these stars represent musical notes?]

1164
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:18,125
I should see if I can play this.

1165
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:22,047
Let me see that.

1166
01:19:28,334 --> 01:19:31,594
This letter...

1167
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,766
It stands for 'Jong'.

1168
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:40,050
['Jong' of Kim Jong Kook.]

1169
01:19:40,051 --> 01:19:42,077
It stands for 'Jong'.

1170
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,919
- Is this supposed to be a thriller?
- 'Jong' of Kim Jong Kook.

1171
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,618
- Is this supposed to be a thriller?
- This episode?

1172
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:52,267
- Is this supposed to be a thriller?
- It's part thriller, and part comedy.

1173
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:56,905
No!

1174
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,536
- Sorry, but you know way too much.
- Seriously!

1175
01:20:01,928 --> 01:20:07,474
[Oh Yeon Seo is eliminated.]

1176
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:09,613
<i>Kwang Soo!</i>

1177
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,915
Lee Kwang Soo.

1178
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,693
[I just need to eliminate you,
and this will all be over.]

1179
01:20:16,766 --> 01:20:19,747
[Kwang Soo attempts to play the piano
with the clue that he's discovered.]

1180
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:36,060
[This familiar strand of melody...]

1181
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,677
Kwang Soo!

1182
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:44,531
Kwang Soo!

1183
01:20:44,532 --> 01:20:48,167
<i>The hero from the backwoods...</i>

1184
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:53,024
<i>Whose name is that of a tiger.</i>

1185
01:20:54,034 --> 01:20:55,638
Lee Kwang Soo!

1186
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:58,130
[The culprit is none other than
Jong Kook, the Tiger!]

1187
01:21:00,668 --> 01:21:02,300
<i>Kwang Soo!</i>

1188
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:07,421
Kwang Soo.

1189
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:17,018
[Jong Kook passes by where Kwang Soo is,
and Kwang Soo successfully escapes.]

1190
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:21,794
[It's now a battle against the clock.]

1191
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:24,237
[Will Kwang Soo make the report first...]

1192
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,699
[Or will Jong Kook capture
Kwang Soo first?]

1193
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:35,472
[Finally discovers the telephone!]

1194
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:38,782
[Please answer the phone!]

1195
01:21:38,783 --> 01:21:40,658
Lee Kwang Soo.

1196
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:43,741
[Hurry!]

1197
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,200
Kwang Soo!

1198
01:21:46,995 --> 01:21:56,716
[Which of the two... was faster?]

1199
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:06,598
[The Symphony Race-
Who will be the star of the concourse?]

1200
01:22:16,669 --> 01:22:20,017
[Culprit, Kim Jong Kook,
has been captured!]

1201
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:24,279
I'm so angry.

1202
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,061
- Did Kwang Soo report you in?
- Did he find the sheet music?

1203
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:34,319
[What is Kwang Soo doing
up on stage?]

1204
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:38,567
[The curtain opens up.]

1205
01:22:38,568 --> 01:22:44,753
[And the genius violinist is seen
standing on stage.]

1206
01:22:44,754 --> 01:22:48,019
[Posed as if he's standing
on top of the world.]

1207
01:22:48,874 --> 01:22:51,073
[Ten minutes ago.]

1208
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:54,990
The culprit is Kim Jong Kook!

1209
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:58,646
[By the split of a hair-
Even though Jong Kook tried...]

1210
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:03,061
[The report is made,
and Running Task Force moves in.]

1211
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,819
He's the culprit!
This man is the culprit!

1212
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:11,759
[Jong Kook's moment on stage
will have to wait until next time.]

1213
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:17,957
[Culprit, Kim Jong Kook, is eliminated.]

1214
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:25,815
[Symphony Race-
The ultimate winner is Lee Kwang Soo.]

1215
01:23:28,369 --> 01:23:30,522
[Can't believe that
Kwang Soo actually did it.]

1216
01:23:30,523 --> 01:23:33,888
I want to sincerely thank all of you for
coming to my very first concourse.

1217
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:37,246
- Congratulations, Kwang Soo.
- Thank you, Suk Jin.

1218
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,436
Ugh, I'm so angry!

1219
01:23:41,236 --> 01:23:44,673
- My fellow genius musicians!
- Is this the sheet music?

1220
01:23:44,674 --> 01:23:47,229
- Jong Kook, the spy.
- I made a huge mistake.

1221
01:23:47,674 --> 01:23:51,026
I was really scared when you
came at me earlier.

1222
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:55,455
- Yeon Seo's going to have nightmares.
- So we were all after a solo concert?

1223
01:23:55,456 --> 01:24:00,801
Lee Kwang Soo is the only person who
will ultimately hold his own concert.

1224
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:03,709
[Symphony Race-
Violinist, Lee Kwang Soo, wins!]
