Gary, you don't look like an alien,
but just an unattractive person.

106

00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,924
Even though earth is really nice,
there's still no place like home.

166
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,156
Yes, you're right.

167
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,724
[Must successfully complete the missions
in order to return to their home planet.]

168
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,754
- Back to our home.
- Back to space.

169
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:20,464
Wow, but look at the scenery outside.

170
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,279
- Wow, it's really nice.
- It's so beautiful.

171
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,488
[The curving river through
the midst of Jiri Mountain...]

172
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,377
[Driving down the beautiful scenic road.]

173
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:41,654
[And the never-ending fields
on either side of the car.]

174
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,643
[Just then, they receive
their first mission.]

175
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:51,511
[First mission- Create mystery circles.]

176
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:59,017
<i>[Spread out and find the missing pieces
to a giant puzzle to complete the puzzle.]</i>

177
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,996
<i>[Complete the puzzle to send out
a distress signal out into space.]</i>

178
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:04,752
[Complete the puzzle to send out
a distress signal for their rescue.]

179
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:09,444
<i>[But can only travel in a straight line
through the rice fields.]</i>

180
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,963
<i>We wish you the best of luck.</i>

181
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,906
[Arrives at the first mission site.]

182
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,956
It's so beautiful out here.

183
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,792
It's so pretty.

184
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:26,924
[The fields surrounds
the outskirts of Jiri Mountain.]

185
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm getting very good
feelings of energy from this place.

186
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,449
- What?
- What would you know about it?

187
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,519
[Andro-Grasshopper suddenly
knows the theory of divination?]

188
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,613
The gravitational force is
very strong here.

189
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:43,016
- I just can't seem to get used to it.
- I can feel my face drooping.

190
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:45,827
- You look like a radish head.
- What?

191
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,681
You look like a cabbage head.

192
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,351
[Cabbage head vs Radish head.]

193
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:54,628
[Just a couple of root vegetable
doppelgangers here on earth?]

194
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,380
With the puzzle pieces being so big,
it has to be tough to piece together, right?

195
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,695
What are you talking about by yourself?

196
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:05,580
[Big-nosed Alien's concentration level
takes a dive in this foreign land.]

197
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,118
Listen to me, mystery circles are large.

198
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,702
Looking at it from up close,
you won't be able to see it very well.

199
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:13,835
- You have a fly in your ear.
- It's like a flytrap.

200
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,987
[Create a mystery circle- Round one.]

201
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:25,491
[All seven aliens take position.]

202
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,927
My shadow looks scary.

203
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:37,095
Those must be the puzzle pieces.

204
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,022
We have to find all those pieces
to create the puzzle?

205
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:45,157
My clothes are so reflective,
and I'm having trouble seeing.

206
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,537
- Let's get this done in one try.
- Let's do this!

207
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,189
- Dong Hoon's too shiny.
- What is he saying?

208
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:55,923
- What?
- Can you turn sideways? You're too bright!

209
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,118
Send me a telepathy message!

210
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,589
Send me a telepathy message!

211
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,442
[Is he... really doing it?]

212
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,672
What the heck did he say?

213
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:17,237
- Let's go back to our home planet!
- Let's do this!

214
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:20,065
- Let's go back home!
- Let's go back to our home planet!

215
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,076
- Fighting!
- Let's go home and back to our families!

216
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:25,330
Let's do this!

217
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,364
[Ready]

218
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:29,775
[Start!]

219
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:35,039
[Starts off at a dead run
at the sound of the whistle.]

220
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,380
[Gary-Opatra is the first
to find a puzzle piece.]

221
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,589
[Find the puzzle piece.]

222
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,423
[Purple Blank Ji also finds
a puzzle piece.]

223
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,893
I found one by pure luck.

224
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:04,480
[Muscle bound Elf... and Andro-Grasshopper
also find their own puzzle pieces.]

225
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,657
Where are the other pieces?

226
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,171
- I found one!
- What?

227
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,812
[Kiddo Alien is the first
to find a second puzzle piece.]

228
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,696
I need to be careful.

229
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:30,704
[Big-nosed Alien, Kwang-Cone head, and
Andro-Grasshopper find their second piece.]

230
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:35,284
[Now it's time to head back
to their meeting spot.]

231
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:41,610
[Will they be able to find all the pieces
to complete their puzzle on time?]

232
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,032
[But... Big-nose gets lost with
his puzzle pieces in hand.]

233
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,230
Do I have to go back to the left?

234
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,540
This place is too wide,
and I don't know where I'm going.

235
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,083
[Meanwhile...]

236
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,068
[Finds a puzzle piece
close to the meeting spot.]

237
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:03,525
[Back towards the meeting spot.]

238
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,809
[Kiddo Alien also closes in
on their meeting spot.]

239
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:09,447
[Must now complete the puzzle
to succeed the mission.]

240
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,955
What is this?

241
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:14,482
[Impossible to understand the puzzle
unless all the pieces are together.]

242
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,206
You have to hurry!

243
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:20,200
- There's no time!
- Over here, Ji Hyo!

244
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:23,061
Song Ji Hyo, over here!

245
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,416
You have to come and get this!

246
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,881
Where is it?
Here it is!

247
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:36,858
- Why am I getting so tired?
- The gravity force is nothing to mess with.

248
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:41,520
[Must endure the force of gravity
to get back to their meeting spot.]

249
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,108
I can't do this anymore!

250
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,453
[Must complete the puzzle.]

251
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:50,103
- I think it's a screw!
- My legs are getting tired.

252
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:54,860
[With more puzzle pieces on hand,
a clearer picture starts to form.]

253
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:59,246
[A picture of some sort of a screw
can be seen in the middle.]

254
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:02,510
Isn't that a screw?
Hurry, Jong Kook!

255
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:07,379
[Grasshopper and the Kiddo Alien
come to help Blank Ji.]

256
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,994
- Where did Suk Jin go?
- That goes down below.

257
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,892
[It seems that Big-nose
is still nowhere to be seen.]

258
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:15,452
- Where did Suk Jin go?
- Is this where it goes?

259
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,116
[Big-nosed Alien finally comes to his senses
and hurries back to the meeting spot.]

260
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:21,114
I have to get back.
We have to succeed the mission.

261
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:23,397
Suk Jin is finally heading back.
It's over.

262
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:26,449
- Hurry up!
- I think it's a star.

263
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,212
- It's almost complete.
- I went way out of the way.

264
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:34,009
[All the pieces will be back together
as soon as Big-nose gets back.]

265
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,519
[It's now comes down to how fast they
can fit all the pieces back together.]

266
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,700
Come on, we can do this.

267
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:42,438
- We have to do this.
- It's a screw.

268
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:43,807
[Complete the screw in the center.]

269
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,075
We have to complete the screw.
Here's a piece.

270
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:50,901
- That's it.
- Get the screw pieces together.

271
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,919
- Is this right?
- Yes, that's correct.

272
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:57,034
- No, that's not it.
- Let me see that.

273
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,090
[The screw is correct, but they seem to be
confused with the background picture.]

274
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,548
- I need one more edge.
- Let me see that.

275
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,652
[Ten seconds left on the clock.]

276
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,978
- Hand that to me.
- Here, take this!

277
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:11,042
[Level of anxiety is on the rise,
but the pieces aren't fitting together.]

278
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,842
[Will they be able to complete the puzzle?]

279
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:22,941
[They miss the final piece,
and unfortunately fail the mission.]

280
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,756
- Flip it over and put it up there!
- This was the final piece.

281
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,596
- Flip it over!
- It's up there!

282
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,373
You're so frustrating!
Flip it over!

283
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:33,323
[He looks like he'll flip over first
before the puzzle piece is flipped over.]

284
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,578
- Do you all get it now?
- Is this right?

285
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,966
[They now know what the completed
puzzle is supposed to look like.]

286
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,450
This game is really aggravating.

287
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,338
- This is ridiculous.
- Is this it?

288
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:48,517
Let's do it like this. Kwang Soo
and Ji Hyo complete the screw

289
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:53,658
then Jae Suk and I will complete this end,
with Suk Jin and Gary on the other end.

290
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,013
Mister, getting the pieces here
isn't the end of the mission.

291
00:18:57,014 --> 00:19:00,142
What are you saying?
Then what have you done?

292
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:03,590
- Why are you just standing there watching?
- I fit a lot of the pieces together.

293
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,687
I'm starting to get a pool
of sweat in my cone.

294
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,008
I feel like all my sweat is
sloshing around in there.

295
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:13,492
Do you have water in there?
You're like a sea squirt.

296
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:16,962
I don't want the viewers to
misunderstand.

297
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:20,389
It's not that we're annoyed, but we're
frowning because it's so bright out here.

298
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,246
- That's why we're squinting.
- But we're having a great time out here.

299
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,378
You're providing me with shade.

300
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,809
Get under here.
He's providing some shade.

301
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,891
- I have a very long shadow.
- I feel like I can finally see.

302
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:34,544
- Yes, I feel like I can finally smile.
- This is some great shading.

303
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:36,123
I can barely open my eyes
when you lift up my collar.

304
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:40,400
[Create the mystery circle- Round two.
Back to their positions.]

305
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,199
Hey, you should dress like that
for your next album concept.

306
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,773
- Why are you saying that?
- Andromeda concept.

307
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:51,090
It's been awhile since you've done this,
so it's time to bring back the space concept.

308
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,988
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

309
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,738
- Yes, that's a great idea.
- Stop singing ballads in your tight shirts.

310
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,251
Like this?

311
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,771
[Falling perfectly in sync with each other.]

312
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:05,622
[We'll let you borrow the costumes
for your next album.]

313
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:10,121
Okay, you'll be starting from different
positions for the second round.

314
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,284
Ji Hyo, look around and see
if you can find where the pieces are.

315
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,858
Where's the other one?

316
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:22,021
- Do you see your pieces?
- I can only see one!

317
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:26,189
- Get ready!
- Fighting!

318
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,225
- Fighting!
- Let's go back home!

319
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,400
[Start!]

320
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,240
[Off to another strong start!]

321
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:42,287
[It's a battle against time.
Must hurry back with the puzzle pieces!]

322
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:44,973
I'm much faster this time.
Very speedy!

323
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:49,847
[At a much faster speed
than the first round.]

324
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:55,078
[Everyone finds their first
puzzle piece in the blink of an eye.]

325
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:00,694
- We can't find Ji Hyo's piece.

- You're so brazen about it.
- They made me wear pants that won't fit.

376

[Do we have to keep running
here on earth?]

392

What is all this?

393

What is this?
It's not even weighed down?

394
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:11,664
Why are you punching that thing now?
Why are you swaying back and forth like that?

395
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:13,796
It's because I can't punch your face.

396
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:16,610
Seriously, just hit that instead!
That's similar.

397

His nose is starting to
droop off of his face.

[Any cookies that falls down to the ground
will be used for the next challenger.]

- I can eat them like this.
- You can move them with your nose.

449
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:15,934
Suk Jin, these cookies are really dry,
so you may not be able to eat very many.

450
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:21,330
I think you should just open up your mouth
and start sucking them in your mouth.

451
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,420
- Or grab them with your lips.
- Are we ready?

- How many has Gary eaten?

480
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:53,070
- Why wasn't I able to do what he's doing?
- Gary, you're doing great!

481
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:59,785

00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,634
Move your hand out of the way.

645
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:19,010
Chew!

646
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,663
Chew!

647
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:26,785
[Wow, he got a lot in his mouth!]

648
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,724
[He ate both rows of the cookies!]

649
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:37,378
[And here's the next line!]

650
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:39,676
- He got 20 at least.
- Great job!

651
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,536
- You got both lines in your mouth!
- You did great!

652
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,530
- You did great, Gary.
- That was amazing.

653
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:50,069
[Gary-Opatra consumes 20, thus
consuming a total of 104 of the 100.]

654
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,026
We did it!

655
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:54,977
[Second mission- Find food on earth.
Mission success!]

656
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,692
[The MVP of the game, Gary-Opatra.]

657
00:39:57,693 --> 00:40:00,483
Gae Eun did it.
That was the highest count.

658
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,765
That was awesome.

659
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:05,473
Hey, Gary.
That was really attractive.

660
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:08,531
Why are you falling for me?
That's making me feel uncomfortable.

661
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,519
- You're making me feel uncomfortable.
- You look much better now, Gae Eun.

662
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,344
You look much better with
your hair in a ponytail.

663
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:17,845
You!

664
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,687
<i>You have succeeded your
second mission.</i>

665
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:28,095
<i>Here's your hint.</i>

666
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,145
[What could this be?]

667
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:35,395
- Blow it off.
- No, don't blow it.

668
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,584
[Wait, this is...]

669
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:44,531
- Isn't this the snail sign?
- Like for the internet?

670
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:46,745
[Could this be the popular internet sign?]

671
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,856
- What's this?
- For an address of some sorts?

672
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:53,087
- Why are you handing it to me?
- It's heavy.

673
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,054
[What could this symbol mean?]

674
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,619
[Off to the final mission site!]

675
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,670
What does that symbol mean?

676
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:10,125
- I have no idea what it is.
- I don't think it's the snail sign.

677
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,654
- What is it then?
- Is it a pathway?

678
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:15,612
[A path or a maze?]

679
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:19,037
- It's the direction for the screw.
- That's it!

680
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:24,647
- It's the direction it's screwed.
- Signal to turn it to the right!

681
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,345
- It's the direction for the screw.
- A direction on how to tighten it.

682
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,125
But I don't know how to apply this.

683
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:33,595
<i>My alien friends,
thanks for all your hard work.</i>

684
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:39,748
<i>Complete the final mission,
and you'll be able to return home.</i>

685
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:41,813
<i>But...</i>

686
00:41:41,814 --> 00:41:45,378
<i>It won't be that simple.</i>

687
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:48,678
If it means that I have to return
alone, then I won't go.

688
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,941
[What is the final mission that
awaits these alien friends?]

689
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:53,515
- Please get in the car.
- You want me to get in?

690
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:04,319
[Huh?]

691
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:07,352
[This scene is...]

692
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,138
Am I going to be a spy?

693
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,314
[Full of anticipation and excitement.]

694
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,348
[A mysterious message.]

695
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:22,622
[You're a Martian.]

696
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,435
Your real identity is that of a Martian
from the planet, Mars.

697
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:28,326
Mars is my home planet?

698
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:35,982
You must go out there and eliminate everyone
from the planet, Venus, to succeed.

699
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:38,188
[Eliminate all the aliens from Venus
to succeed his mission.]

700
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:46,968
[Weren't we all from the same planet?]

701
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,993
How many Martians are there?
Am I the only Martian?

702
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,329
- Some are from Venus and some from Mars?
- Okay, get out there.

703
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:05,987
We're not all on the same side?
I have to do this secretly?

704
00:43:05,988 --> 00:43:07,979
[Martian, Kwang-Cone head,
is left befuddled.]

705
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:11,094
We're not all the same.

706
00:43:11,095 --> 00:43:17,655
[Martian's mission-
Eliminate all the aliens from Venus.]

707
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,128
I have to eliminate everyone
from Venus.

708
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:21,837
[Next up, Kiddo-Alien.]

709
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:23,311
Why are they splitting us up?

710
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:26,815
[He's also invited to enter the car.]

711
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,153
Your real identity is...

712
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,469
a Martian.

713
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,179
[He's also a Martian?]

714
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,853
You are from the planet, Mars.

715
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:49,060
You must eliminate everyone from the
planet, Venus, in order to succeed.

716
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:51,711
[Martian Kiddo Alien is given the same
mission as Kwang-Cone head.]

717
00:43:52,177 --> 00:43:54,395
Why are you giving me a mission
like this all of a sudden?

718
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:57,584
Why are you burdening me like this?

719
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:03,404
Why are you suddenly... can you not do this?
Can we do this next week instead?

720
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:06,731
I'm not feeling prepared for this.

721
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:13,310
[Andro-Grasshopper's
enters the mission vehicle.]

722
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,289
What is this about?

723
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,003
I'm a Martian?

724
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:22,523
[He's also a Martian?]

725
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:25,371
You're from the planet, Mars.

726
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,660
[This alien... and this alien, too?]

727
00:44:28,137 --> 00:44:31,340
You're a Martian, from the planet, Mars.

728
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:33,603
[They're all from Mars?]

729
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:38,403
You must eliminate everyone from
the planet, Venus, in order to succeed.

730
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:41,324
[They're all given the same mission.
Eliminate all the aliens from Venus!]

731
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:44,751
- How many Martians are there?
- Eliminate all from the planet, Venus.

732
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,030
So it's a battle between
Mars and Venus?

733
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:50,817
[A battle between Mars and Venus.
Everyone receives the mission in secret.]

734
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:55,314
[Good luck, Martian!]

735
00:44:57,716 --> 00:45:01,782
[And the one last remaining alien...]

736
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:09,101
You are from the planet, Venus.

737
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:12,909
[You are from the planet, Venus.]

738
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,734
[Muscle Elf is the only alien
from the planet, Venus.]

739
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:23,177
There are Martians mixed in the midst
of the other seven alien members.

740
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,563
You must find out who the Martians are
and eliminate them

741
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:29,960
in order to return to your own
home planet.

742
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:32,684
[Eliminate all the Martians in order
to return to your own home planet.]

743
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,487
Okay, you're all set.
You may get started.

744
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:44,966
[But the fact that he's the only one from
Venus is unknown to everyone else.]

745
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:47,839
[Which means...]

746
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,179
- I'm a Martian?
- You're a Martian.

747
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:58,065
[Six Martians...]

748
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:01,292
You're from the planet, Venus.

749
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,954
[Against one from planet, Venus.]

750
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:07,888
[Venus vs Mars.]

751
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:12,930
A battle between Mars and Venus.
But how do I know which one is which?

752
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:15,340
[The problem is that their identity
is unknown to each other.]

753
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:18,581
So I'm from another planet?

754
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:23,835
Am I the only one who received
this secret mission?

755
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:26,019
Is this a spy mission?

756
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,384
[All six Martians are thinking that
they are the only Martian around.]

757
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:34,888
Anyone who's on the same team with
the blond haired alien is at an advantage.

758
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:40,167
[Will the six Martians be able to work
together to oust the only alien from Venus?]

759
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,395
[Mars vs Venus.
Intergalactic War- start!]

760
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:48,937
Am I the only Martian here?
What is going on here?

761
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:53,495
The hint given...

762
00:46:54,183 --> 00:47:02,603
[The hints they've been given so far...
seem to indicate who the Martians are.]

763
00:47:02,604 --> 00:47:05,127
The screw and the snail symbol.

764
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,421
The screw...

765
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,769
The screw...

766
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:14,357
[No idea what those hints indicate.]

767
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:17,946
Ugh, this is giving me a headache.

768
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:22,036
Kwang Soo.

769
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:25,467
- Jae Suk, you haven't forgotten our deal?
- Come here.

770
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,396
[Kwang-Cone head and Andro-Grasshopper
are already forming an alliance.]

771
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:30,748
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I'm trusting you this time.

772
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:33,420
I'm telling you the truth.
Let's team up.

773
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:36,686
[But neither one of them are revealing
which planet they're from.]

774
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:41,520
- We could be from the same home planet.
- Let's not do this to each other.

775
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:43,449
- I'm serious.
- Let's not do this to each other.

776
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,563
You don't want Kim Jong Kook
to win, do you?

777
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:48,112
- We can't have him win.
- No, we can't let that happen again.

778
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:51,891
- No, let's not let that happen.
- I'm going to eliminate him no matter what.

779
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:55,360
- You have to keep your promise.
- I promise.

780
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,010
I'll see you later.

781
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:59,827
[They're parting ways after
forging an alliance...]

782
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:01,641
Okay, think about those hints.

783
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:04,888
But what do those hints...

784
00:48:07,104 --> 00:48:09,681
[That's what we thought!]

785
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,013
Jae Suk.

786
00:48:14,154 --> 00:48:16,588
Don't be like this, Kwang Soo.

787
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:20,646
- There were two hints, right?
- Kwang Soo, let's not be like this.

788
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,866
- Don't do this, Kwang Soo. I trust you.
- The screw...

789
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,276
Okay, Jae Suk.

790
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:30,108
[Hurry!]

791
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:34,862
[His turn?]

792
00:48:34,863 --> 00:48:37,072
[But this one is still here.]

793
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:39,262
Why haven't you left yet?
Don't be like this.

794
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,128
[Meaningless schemes by
the two Martians.]

795
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,455
- I'm seriously trusting you.
- Just leave.

796
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:46,707
[They could eliminate all this suspicion by
just coming clean about their identities...]

797
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:49,471
I can't lose him like this.

798
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,571
[Turns around again.]

799
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,345
[Never-ending relay of betrayal.]

800
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:06,200
What is this?

801
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:12,049
[Martian Kiddo Alien,
and Martian Gary-Opatra.]

802
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,917
[Remaining cautious.]

803
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,274
- What have you been told?
- What?

804
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:20,633
Well, I...

805
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:23,089
- I don't really remember.
- Why are you doing this to me?

806
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,625
- I may be suffering from amnesia.
- Tell me, I really want to know.

807
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:28,192
- What did they tell you?
- They didn't tell me anything.

808
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:31,933
- Why didn't they tell you anything?
- They told me to just leave the car.

809
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,145
- Tell me the truth.
- You tell me first.

810
00:49:34,146 --> 00:49:36,096
- I'm being serious.
- Come on, Gary.

811
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:39,348
- Lately, we've...
- You're smirking right now.

812
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:44,187
- We haven't talked much lately.
- I know we haven't.

813
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,335
But they really didn't tell me
anything.

814
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,333
[You're both Martians with the
same mission.]

815
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:51,115
Let's go meet up with others,
and talk this out.

816
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,373
[Leaves in search for others while
remaining full of suspicion for each other.]

817
00:49:54,904 --> 00:50:00,444
Wait, but...
What were you just about to do?

818
00:50:00,445 --> 00:50:02,744
- What?
- I saw that glint in your eye.

819
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:06,472
- What are you talking about?
- I'm really disappointed in you.

820
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,237
- I'm the one who feels disappointed.
Come on, let's go.

821
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,509
Why are you being so weary of me?
Come on, hold my hand.

822
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,138
- Hold my hand.
- I'm fine.

823
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,110
[From their inability to tell each other
that they're both Martians...]

824
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:19,448
[In the end, they leave with
their two hands tightly held together.]

825
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,753
Wow, Gary.

826
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:26,598
[Once the sun sets, no one can return home.
Only 21 minutes left until the sun sets.]

827
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:31,118
Are there more of us from
Venus or Mars?

828
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,801
I can't seem to figure that out.

829
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:39,037
[Deity of Jiri Mountain?]

830
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:42,123
- Where are you from?
- I can't tell you that.

831
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:45,197
- We've already told each other.
- I'm from Jamsil.

832
00:50:45,658 --> 00:50:48,750
I'm sorry to ask this, but is
there an event going on nearby?

833
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,992
[Grand Opening event for
an alien grocery store!]

834
00:50:51,993 --> 00:50:55,178
- I just wanted to ask.
- You're the weirdest looking one here.

835
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:58,042
- Kwang Soo is...
- Ji Hyo, are you the Fifth Element?

836
00:50:58,043 --> 00:51:00,078
I really am the fifth element.

837
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,519
- She's lying.
- What do those two previous hints mean?

838
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,260
[What is the hidden meaning
behind those two hints?]

839
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:13,977
[And this alien from Venus is watching
all this from up above.]

840
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:16,559
Look at Kwang Soo going crazy.

841
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:22,753
[Martians are unable to trust each other
and start their attack on one another.]

842
00:51:22,754 --> 00:51:25,252
- Jae Suk, which planet are you from?
- Kwang Soo!

843
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:28,061
- Stop being so ridiculous about this.
- Once the sun sets, it's all over for us.

844
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:31,249
[Once the sun sets, no one can
go back to their home planet!]

845
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,643
- Look up there.
- The moon is already up.

846
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:37,110
[My home planet is somewhere
up in that sky...]

847
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:38,807
One of us needs to get ousted!

848
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:41,465
[All the Martians are suspicious
of one another.]

849
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,742
[Traitors Cross!]

850
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:47,212
[As long as it's not me!
Starts the attack on Andro-Grasshopper.]

851
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:52,877
[What are these Martians doing
to their own kind?]

852
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:56,125
- The Traitors Club must stick together!
- Someone needs to be eliminated!

853
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:02,660
Running Man is entertaining.

854
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:05,492
- Kwang Soo, today's the day! Grab him!
- The sun is setting.

855
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:08,056
- You have to grab one of them.
- U!

856
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:11,122
- UEE!
- I miss you!

857
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:14,011
- Gary, come on!
- You want my help?

858
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,834
[Just then...]

859
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:26,028
[Kiddo Alien eliminates
Andro-Grasshopper's name tag!]

860
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:30,611
[He has to be from Venus, right?]

861
00:52:33,404 --> 00:52:34,850
What the heck!

862
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:37,542
[Martian]

863
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:38,962
What the heck!

864
00:52:40,738 --> 00:52:46,105
[I'm not... the only Martian?]

865
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:49,388
[Martians eliminates another Martian.]

866
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:56,448
I can't believe that I've been had
by those traitors.

867
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:00,649
[Andro-Grasshopper- Out!]

868
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:05,211
Wait a minute...
Everyone looks quite shocked here.

869
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:07,547
- Wait.
- What does this mean?

870
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:10,432
Who was shocked to see that?

871
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:13,048
[Since they can't trust each other, they
can't even let on about their shock.]

872
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:15,953
[Extreme confusion in their heads.]

873
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,577
[This one alien is still monitoring
everything that's going on.]

874
00:53:20,707 --> 00:53:23,118
A Martian has been ousted.

875
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,882
Wow, I'm about to lose it.

876
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:34,032
A Martian's been ousted.
Why didn't he tell me that he's a Martian?

877
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:37,908
See?
Jae Suk was a Martian.

878
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,624
Something feels off.

879
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:46,803
When Jae Suk was eliminated,
everyone had a shocked look on their faces.

880
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,519
As if they realized that he
shouldn't have been eliminated.

881
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,281
[Venus vs Mars]

882
00:53:57,282 --> 00:54:00,626
- What was Jae Suk?
- What?

883
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:03,430
- Martian.
- Martian? Really?

884
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:06,396
[Muscle Elf finds out that
Jae Suk was a Martian.]

885
00:54:07,439 --> 00:54:09,815
A Martian's already been ousted?

886
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:12,153
A Martian's been ousted?

887
00:54:12,154 --> 00:54:15,859
[Even the only alien from Venus doesn't
know how many Martians there are...]

888
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,121
I wonder if half the members
are Martians?

889
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:26,485
[Even in the midst of all this,
the sun continues to set on the horizon...]

890
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:33,965
- I think those hints that we received...
- We need to figure out those hints.

891
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:35,935
Yes, that's right.
We all need to figure out the hints.

892
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:42,615
[But the Martians have yet to reveal
their true identities to each other.]

893
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:45,731
- Jae Suk was a Martian, right?
- Yes.

894
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:50,295
Jong Kook, are you from Venus?

895
00:54:51,532 --> 00:54:54,409
Yeah, I'm from Venus.

896
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:59,309
[He's from Venus?]

897
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:01,666
I'm being honest.
I'm from Venus.

898
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:03,080
Seriously?

899
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:08,091
I'm from Venus. Anyone else
from Venus, tell me who you are.

900
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:11,368
- Don't be like this and help me, if you are.
- Are you really from Venus?

901
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,691
Anyone else from Venus?

902
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:18,133
[They all raise their hands
up in the air.]

903
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:21,236
If you're also from Venus, then
why are you trying to oust me?

904
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:23,931
- Are you really from Venus?
- I'm from Venus.

905
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:27,825
You wouldn't be lying about being from
Venus when you're really a Martian, right?

906
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:30,695
If anyone else is from Venus,
then come stand next to me right now.

907
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:33,130
- Are you telling the truth?
- Of course.

908
00:55:33,131 --> 00:55:36,863
[Even though he tells them the truth,
they still don't believe his words.]

909
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,721
- What do we do?
- What are we going to do?

910
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,320
[Staying extremely weary
of one another...]

911
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:57,473
[Muscle Elf climbs over the wall
to start his attack.]

912
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,389
[Just then...]

913
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:04,346
[Gary-Opatra's ambush attack.]

914
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:10,379
[Martian... another Martian!]

915
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:16,337
[What are we doing right now?]

916
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:18,558
- He's a Martian.
- He's clearly a Martian.

917
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,578
[These Martians continue their attack on
each other, making Jong Kook's job easier.]

918
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:27,010
[Venus vs Mars]

919
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:29,432
Wait, what's going on here?

920
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,503
[Add one more to the list of Martian
who ousted his own member.]

921
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,057
Everyone we eliminate
ends up being a Martian.

922
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:41,702
I think I need to eliminate more and see.

923
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:44,509
But what if it ends up being
another Martian?

924
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:48,863
- Are you really from Venus?
- Get away from me!

925
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:53,322
- Just get away from me right now!
- Come on, don't be like that.

926
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:54,634
[Muscle Elf doesn't want
the infamous traitor by his side.]

927
00:56:55,098 --> 00:56:57,180
- Are you really not going to do it?
- Do what?

928
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,590
- You look so lonely by yourself.
- I can't trust you.

929
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:02,539
I'm always left on my own
whenever we play name tag elimination.

930
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,115
Think about this.
Two Martians have been ousted so far.

931
00:57:05,116 --> 00:57:09,304
Which heightens the chance that
I'm from Venus, but I can't show you that.

932
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,418
[I don't need to know!]

933
00:57:12,419 --> 00:57:16,124
- Just do it by yourself.
- The others keeps coming after me.

934
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:19,046
That's good for me because
I can just monitor from afar.

935
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:21,922
- What if it ends up that I'm from Venus?
- It's okay.

936
00:57:21,923 --> 00:57:23,497
It's okay.

937
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:27,022
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

938
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:32,870
It's like this. I'd rather part from you
than be tricked by you.

939
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:35,011
Don't you agree?
Haven't you felt like that before?

940
00:57:35,012 --> 00:57:37,812
Isn't that part of the fun?
Getting tricked?

941
00:57:37,813 --> 00:57:39,535
No, it's not.

942
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:43,131
[The time is running out for their chance
to return to their own home planet...]

943
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:46,022
I think we're all Martians.

944
00:57:46,023 --> 00:57:48,127
I think we're all from Mars.

945
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,703
- Suk Jin.
- Yeah?

946
00:57:51,473 --> 00:57:54,191
- I think you're right.
- I think we're all from Mars.

947
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:58,603
I think we're all Martians, and
we're just eliminating our own kind.

948
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:02,701
[Could we all be Martians?]

949
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:09,435
We should all gather together and
announce that we're all Martians...

950
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:11,633
- I think you're right.
- Confess that we're all Martians.

951
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:13,857
We need to stop eliminating each other.

952
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:16,255
- I think that's the right thing to do.
- I think you're right.

953
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:19,158
- Don't you think that's right?
- You're a Martian, aren't you?

954
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:21,571
- You're a Martian, right?
- What about you?

955
00:58:21,572 --> 00:58:23,727
You're a Martian, aren't you?

956
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:27,174
- Yes, I'm a Martian.
- I'm a Martian, too.

957
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:29,806
We're all Martians.
I think Jong Kook's a Martian, too.

958
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:32,857
Anyone who'd confess to being from Venus
inevitably ends up being from Mars.

959
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:42,166
Let's go check on Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.
We've already eliminated two Martians.

960
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:46,290
[Ugh, they're so frustrating...]

961
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:48,579
Let's go check on Suk Jin.

962
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,706
- Let's go check him out.
- I'll suggest we eliminate Jong Kook.

963
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:54,868
[Just be honest with each other,
and eliminate Jong Kook to win it!]

964
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:59,410
I think we can be sure whether or not we're
all Martians if we eliminate just one more.

965
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:03,178
- Stop it, Suk Jin.
- I'm sorry.

966
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:06,845
- Stop it.
- I can't help it.

967
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:09,713
Suk Jin!

968
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:12,180
- Yeah?
- Jong Kook is nearby right now.

969
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,243
- That's not the problem right now.
- What is it?

970
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:18,597
Our guess is that we're all Martians.

971
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:21,268
- Why would you think that?
- We're all Martians.

972
00:59:21,985 --> 00:59:25,871
- Jong Kook said he's from Venus.
- No, he's a Martian, too.

973
00:59:25,872 --> 00:59:28,022
[Purple Princess Blank Ji is convinced
that Jong Kook is also from Mars.]

974
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,246
Instead of fighting each other like this,
let's just eliminate Jong Kook first.

975
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:31,786
Should we go?

976
00:59:31,787 --> 00:59:35,374
What if several of us end up getting
eliminated in our attempt to oust him?

977
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:38,488
- But we have no other choice.
- Think about this.

978
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:41,604
- Jong Kook will eliminate someone anyway.
- Suk Jin, let's go get Jong Kook.

979
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:44,717
Let's promise not to eliminate one another
until we get Jong Kook first.

980
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:48,264
- You're the least trustworthy person.
- I'm being serious.

981
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:50,493
- Can you promise me that?
- Okay, let's go.

982
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:53,373
- You can't betray us.
- I promise that I won't.

983
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:55,355
- Promise not to betray each other.
- I promise.

984
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:03,277
[This is the loyalty that lies
between Traitors Club.]

985
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:09,911
See?

986
01:00:11,101 --> 01:00:13,371
[Martian]

987
01:00:13,372 --> 01:00:15,641
See?
We shouldn't be acting like this!

988
01:00:15,642 --> 01:00:18,499
[And look where you wound up...]

989

[Martian, Big-nosed Alien- Out!]

990
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:24,464
I'm telling you that I'm right.
This is what I've been trying to tell you!

991
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:26,960
We're all Martians.

992
01:00:28,077 --> 01:00:30,113
Do you get it now?
Do you believe me now?

993
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:38,947
- Then what do we do now?
- There's no sense in eliminating any more.

994
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:42,981
The most important thing is to
solve the riddle behind those clues.

995
01:00:42,982 --> 01:00:46,286
- Let's eliminate Jong Kook first.
- Why do you want to eliminate everyone?

996
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:49,664
- You're from Venus, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

997
01:00:49,665 --> 01:00:53,343
[Kwang-Cone head is now being
suspected of being from Venus.]

998
01:00:53,344 --> 01:00:55,577
- Gary, he's from Venus.
- I really am a Martian.

999
01:00:55,578 --> 01:00:57,712
- Are you a Martian?
- I don't know.

1000
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:01,162
I'm not going to say anything
about anything.

1001
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,091
Whenever I say anything,
I end up on the losing end.

1002
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:06,893
[The Martians are once again...]

1003
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:11,093
- I'm not going to say anything.
- Be honest. Are you from Mars or Venus?

1004
01:01:11,094 --> 01:01:14,457
- I'm a Martian.
- Let's go before the sun sets.

1005
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:15,868
[Proposing that they go to
eliminate Jong Kook.]

1006
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:19,409
Then go to Jong Kook right now
like you want to.

1007
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,701
[I can't help the way I am.]

1008
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:24,875
- Why do you keep doing that?
- I really don't know either!

1009
01:01:25,463 --> 01:01:28,425
- You really don't know?
- I don't know, but there's no time.

1010
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:31,174
I can't go home anymore.
I'll be in trouble if I come home late.

1011
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:35,104
I have to get home before it gets dark.
My mom said bad men come out at night!

1012
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:37,575
What if the screw is indicating to his head?

1013
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:40,579
My head looks like a persimmon.

1014
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:43,613
- My head is just...
- And this means a screwed up life.

1015
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,879
What are you saying about my life?

1016
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:48,804
Just think about it!

1017
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,902
What's that supposed to mean?

1018
01:01:50,903 --> 01:01:53,905
- Let's go, the sun is about to set.
- The sun is starting to set.

you're from Venus.

1022
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:06,907
- That I'm from Venus?
- Yeah.

1023
01:02:06,908 --> 01:02:09,992
- Are you from Mars or from Venus?
- You said you're from Venus.

1024

- Are you from Mars?
- No.

1025

There he comes right now.

- You're both from Mars, aren't you?
- No, I really am not.

1031
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:33,397
Wait, are you all from Mars?

1032
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:37,771
- That's what I've been saying all along.
- But you're from Venus.

1033
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:42,991
Yeah, I did say...
that I'm from Venus.

1034
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,004

from Venus.

1062
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:23,379

to the number, one.]

01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:26,157
I'm from Venus,
and you're all from Mars.

1128
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,568
- Why couldn't you all just do that?
- Stop scolding us.

1129
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:34,389
- These two are seriously...
- Me?

1130
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:37,039
- Are you talking about me?
- I'm about to lose it.

1131
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,703
- No, it's these two, Suk Jin and Dong Hoon!
- I was honest all along!

1132
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:44,290
- Ugh, you egg sack!
- Ugh, seriously!

1133
01:08:45,019 --> 01:08:48,130
This is why I don't like Martians.

1134
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:49,924
- They're no good.
- No good!

1135
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:54,324
- Song Ji Hyo may return back home.
- Leave!

1136
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:56,281
[Princess Blank Ji may now return home.]

1137
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:58,489
But I'd like to propose something.

1138
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,581
Can she take someone with her?

1139
01:09:01,361 --> 01:09:03,858
- The truth is...
- She'll be too lonely by herself.

1140
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:06,426
We'll give you a choice to make.

1141
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:11,037
We have prepared a relocation
fund for you to move to earth.

1142
01:09:11,644 --> 01:09:16,200
- Relocation fund? As in gold?
- How does she get so lucky every time?

1143
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:18,476
- What's this?
- Are you kidding me?

1144
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:20,984
- Wow, look at all that gold!
- How much gold is there?

1145
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:23,652
[A basket full of gold
for her relocation fund.]

1146
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:28,838
You can take the gold and make a new
life for yourself here on earth.

1147
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:33,356
Or you can return back to
your home planet.

1148
01:09:33,357 --> 01:09:35,614
- If she leaves, she can't have the gold?
- This place isn't bad.

1149
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:40,634
There's a condition to you taking the gold
and stepping up on the earth platform.

1150
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,816
You must live on earth dressed
in the garment you're currently wearing.

1151
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:46,071
That's the condition for taking the gold.

1152
01:09:46,072 --> 01:09:51,491
You must send us a picture of yourself eating
dinner at a gas station in that garment.

1153
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:54,299
- That's no big deal.
- I wouldn't even hesitate!

1154
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,792
I'd for sure take the gold!

1155
01:09:56,793 --> 01:10:00,071
[Stay on earth in her clothes with the gold,
or dress normally and leave without the gold?]

1156
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:02,003
What are you even hesitating about?

1157
01:10:02,004 --> 01:10:05,107
- Let's split the gold!
- There's nothing to think about!

1158
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:07,381
I'd even sleep in this getup.

1159
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:11,546
- I really can sleep like this.
- I'll even come back next week like this.

1160
01:10:11,547 --> 01:10:14,075
The fact that you're even hesitating about
this shows that you don't need the gold.

1161
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,973
[She's frivolous to even hesitate?]

1162
01:10:15,974 --> 01:10:17,991
You have to send us two pictures as proof.

1163
01:10:17,992 --> 01:10:21,132
- Two pictures?
- One picture at dinner...

1164
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,565
and one more taken in front
of your house.

1165
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,724
And lastly, another picture from her bed.

1166
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:30,365
- I like that last picture idea.
- Why are you even hesitating? I'd do it!

1167
01:10:30,366 --> 01:10:36,730
You have five seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one!

1168
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,169
[Chooses the relocation gold!]

1169
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:44,720
[Purple Blank Ji's pictures of
evidence will soon be revealed.]

1170
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:46,876
I'd have reasons to hesitate.

1171
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:52,322
Looking the way you do,
you have the right to hesitate a bit.

1172
01:10:52,323 --> 01:10:56,708
The rest of us can do some events and
make our living since we're stuck on earth.

1173
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,766
- We can make our new lives like that.
- Okay, let's do it.

1174
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:02,216
- Let's go.
- We can start working this weekend!

1175
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,934
[We wish all our aliens lots of luck
with their new lives here on earth.]

1176
01:11:08,175 --> 01:11:13,093
[One hour after filming wrapped...]

1177
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:18,510
[Purple Blank Ji having dinner
with her earthling Monday boyfriend.]

1178
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:22,261
[After dinner at the gas station...]

1179
01:11:22,262 --> 01:11:24,395
[Greets her earthling fans...]

1180
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:26,552
[In the parking lot of her house...]

1181
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:28,427
[Right before going to bed.]

1182
01:11:28,428 --> 01:11:32,535
[Goodnight!
- Purple Blank Ji.]

1183
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:34,247
