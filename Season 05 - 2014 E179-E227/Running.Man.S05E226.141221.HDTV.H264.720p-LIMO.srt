The end of the year is upon us already.
We wish everyone a great holiday season.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,880
We have special guests that are here

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,870
[Special guests are waiting
inside the elevator?]

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,930

[Yes, this is it!]

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,570
Wow, I don't remember you
ever being on a variety show before?

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Look at how alert and animated
her eyes are.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,030
[What a rude thing to say!]

30
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,890

31
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,460

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,100
Please forgive me even if I do
something a bit weird and bizarre.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,510
[Such elegance in her voice!]

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,130
Are you wearing tennis shoes because you
knew you were going to be on Running Man?

35
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,280
Yes, I wore my tennis shoes.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,210
I don't think I've ever seen you
wear tennis shoes before.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,630
She normally wears the
old rubber shoes.

38
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,540
[Huh?]

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,970
When have you ever seen me
wear rubber shoes?

40
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,160
In dramas and movies.

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,590
She wore shoes
even in the movie, 'Country Diary.'

42
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,830
[That's right.]

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,080
Hello, my name is Kang Hye Jung.

44

you're married to mini grasshopper.

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,340
[Mini grasshopper, Tablo's wife.]

46
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,100
I really wanted him to be on
the alien special you just had.

47
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,410
He really does look a lot like me.

48
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,990
And a member from the show,
Family Outing.

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,570
[A member from the Family Outing,
Lee Chun Hee.]

50
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,930
- He had Kwang Soo's role on that show.
- He passed his role onto Kwang Soo.

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,320
[The original goof, and the new goof.]

52
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,760
[Stay tuned for Chun Hee's
goofball antics.]

53
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,070
- Ms. Song Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

54
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,060
- Didn't we film 'Goong' together?
- Yes, that's right.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,450
- Thank you for remembering.
- She was just as pretty back then.

56
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,930
- Yes, that's true.
- She was pretty back then.

57
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,350
What are you talking about?
She's still pretty!

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,640
When I say, 'just as pretty',
it means that she's still pretty.

59
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,850
[Kkuk is knocked out.]

60
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,300
[She's the best!]

61
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,980
I never imagined a day
like this would come.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,670
It's truly an honor to
have you here.

63
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,870
I can't believe that she actually
came on our variety show.

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,110
I used to think that she and Choi Bul Ahm
were a real married couple.

65
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,820
- Yes, I used to think that, too.
- You've heard that before, right?

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,740
Your speech is so old fashioned.

67
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,210
Your speech is so old fashioned.

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,160
[Old kiddo, Ha Ha is knocked out.]

69
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,110
[Sorry...]

70
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,930
[Such unique and direct approach
in her speech.]

71
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,930
- Are we just going to be talking on the show?
- No, we won't just be talking.

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,080
[I'm sorry to say that won't
be the case.]

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,060
- I'm not going to be made to run, am I?
- You'll have to play the name tag elimination.

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,230
- We'll have to rip off the name tags.
- Try ripping it off.

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,850
- You have to rip it off really hard.
- There you go.

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,710
- Then I'd be ousted from the game.
- Okay, then I won't rip it off.

77
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,970
She says she won't rip it off then.

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,150
If yours gets ripped off,
then you'll have to go to jail.

79
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,060
[Jail?]

80
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,990
- But Suk Jin and I'll be there, too.
- Okay.

81
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,830
She's going to pull you off to the side
after we're done filming the show.

82
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,670
- Rubber shoes and jail?
- I was just explaining the rules to her.

83
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,310
Today's race will be our Christmas special
since Christmas is just around the corner.

84
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,340
- It's like being with family.
- This is our Christmas special.

85
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,960
[These special guests are like
a Christmas gift to them.]

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,530
We have prepared a Christmas gift
that's geared more towards adults.

87
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,530
A prefect way to spend your Christmas,
Santa's Lottery Race.

88
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,990
Santa's lottery race?

89
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,210
For this race, all ten of you will be teamed
up together to carry out the mission.

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,610
With the completion of each round,
you'll be given a chance to win the lottery.

91
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,350
The lottery drawing zone
is set up over on the side

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,600
and Kim Hye Ja will pick the winning number
which will determine the prize amount.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,030
With each mission that you win

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,490
you will be given a chance to
increase the amount of the prize

95
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,460
and if you fail the mission,
then you'll be given a disadvantage.

96
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,660
Please do your best to succeed the mission,
and take home the magic of the holidays.

97
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,660
- If we win, then we get a prize.
- All of us?

98
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,250
- Yes, everyone.
- We're all on the same team.

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,350
Think of it as a competition
against the producers.

100
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,280
So, those people are our enemies?

101
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,410
- Yes, they're the bad bastards.
- Think of them as our enemies.

102
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,740
- You just called them 'Bad bastards.'
- Sorry, I meant, bad guys.

103
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,410
I meant we're the good guys, and
they're bad. Sorry, please excuse me.

104
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,730
[Whether we're good and they're bad,
we're all still on the same team.]

105
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,280
[Gyunggido Division of 'Job World.']

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,800
The fact that Lady Kim Hye Ja is
here as a guest on Running Man

107
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,660
- is truly an honor.
- She seems to be leaning on you a lot.

108
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,310
I really want to wear one of these jackets,
but I'm afraid that I'd sweat in it.

109
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,230
But I see that you already have
your name tag stuck on your back.

110
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,290
You already have your name tag on.

111
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,520
[You have to chat and laugh on Christmas
because it only comes around once a year.]

112
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,690
- Merry Christmas!
- Santa's lottery race.

113
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,350
Here's your first mission.
Your first mission is, Unity Mission Relay.

114
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,600
You have to go and find an item that fits
within the category in the time limit given.

115
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,220
The mission will be carried out here.
Here's the category of the mission.

116
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,260
Take a selfie picture with
an animal mask.

117
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,670
[Animal mask?
A selfie?]

118
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,280
You have to spread out and
find a different animal mask

119
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,940
and take a selfie picture with everyone,
and all of you have to be in the shot.

120
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,830
- We'll start the clock now.
- Where do I have to go?

121
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,270
- Where do we go?
- It's all within this building.

122
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,260

- Wait.

123
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,900
- He said something about an animal mask.
- We have to take a picture with it on.

124
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,290
Ready, set, go!

125
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,780
- Find one for her first.
- Find one and give it to her first!

126
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,480
[All the members are making efforts
to take care of Lady Kim.]

127
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,450
[Gary discovers the rabbit mask.]

128
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,600
There's the rabbit mask.
Lady Kim can wear the rabbit mask.

129
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,400
[Gary tries to get the rabbit mask over
to Lady Kim as soon as he finds it.]

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,130
[But Big Sister Kim is already
in full search mode for a mask.]

131
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,260
Lady Kim!

132
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,860
Take this and go wait for us.
We'll be right there.

133
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,690
But I'll keep searching, too.

134
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,680
[She can just go and wait...]

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,810
[But she can't seem to quit her search.]

136
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,330
[She already seems acclimated
to the ways of Running Man.]

137
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,510
Here's one!
I found the cat!

[All the members must come back with a mask
to take the picture in order to succeed.]

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Have people already searched
through here? Be honest with me.

144
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,180
They've already been here,
haven't they?

145
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,110
There's no need to search through
a place that's already been searched.

146
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,950
[Doing her best to find another mask when she
already has one tightly within her grasp.]

and attempts to take a selfie picture.]

160

[Not easy to get all ten people in the shot
without a selfie stick.]

161
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,680
Where are you?

162
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,220
[Everyone rushes back to
the mission site.]

163
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,180
Hurry back!

164
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,020
[Still waiting on five more people.]

165
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,110
- Kwang Soo, you take the phone.
- We have to get everyone in the shot.

166
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,220
[Human Giraffe sure comes in handy
at times like this.]

167
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,930
[Everyone except for Gary is back.]

168
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,190
- Where's Lady Kim?
- She's down here.

169
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,290
- Gary's not here.
- We just need Gary to come back.

170
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,380
Come on, Gary!

171
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,040
[Hurry back, Gary.]

172
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,740
[Rushes back to the group after
finally having found a mask of his own.]

173
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,060
[All ten are finally back together,
and rush to take the selfie.]

174
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,660
[Squeezes in together
as tightly as possible.]

175
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,240
- Stretch out your arm some more.
- Stretch your arm out.

176
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,680
- Gary, you have to look up at the camera.
- Sit lower.

177
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,610
Gary, lift up your head some more.

178
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,610
[Lift up your head, Gary.]

179
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,060
- The chicken head is too big.
- Lower the chicken head.

180
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,170
- Suk Jin, lower your head even more.
- That's good.

181
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,380
I think we got it.

182
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,130
Ugh, it's hot.

183
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,490
[Getting steamed up after only
one mission.]

184
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,380
What are you asking Lady Kim
to do here?

185
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,700
What took you so long to
come back, Gary?

186
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,830
I'm sorry, Lady Kim.
I'll be better next time.

187
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,610
[I'm just kidding, Gary.]

188
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,700
[Only eight out of ten are shown.
Mission fail.]

189
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,310
[Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are out
of the shot. Mission fail.]

190
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,400
[Where's Gary?
Mission fail.]

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,620
- That's disappointing.
- I found three masks.

192
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,680
- You found three masks?
- Yes, I found three masks.

193
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,120
- But you're really bad at finding things.
- You're awful at finding things.

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,320
But I was able to find the masks.
When it had nothing to do with winning.

195
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,510
[His searching skills are at its peak when
winning a mission isn't hanging on the line.]

196
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,840
- Lady Kim, we have to start running again.
- Yes, do not worry.

197
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,810
[Competitiveness is starting to peak
after only the first round.]

198
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,370
- You're not mad at me, are you?
- Yes, she's angry.

199
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,080
Why would you say that to her?

200
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,450
Your next mission is,
'Weigh the Item'.

201
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,540
You have to disperse and bring back
an item to weigh on the scale

202
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,140
and if the combined weight of your items are
more than 150kg, then you win the mission.

203
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,790
The clock starts now.
Start!

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,880
- 150kg?
- We have to bring back something?

205
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,430
Jong Kook, bring back
the heaviest thing you can find.

206
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,330
It has to be something that's
marked with an 'R' sticker.

207
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,430
- It has to be 15kg per item.
- They have to be heavy items.

208
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,900
- I'm sure they're all on the second floor.
- Right?

209
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,850
[Her search radar is back on
with the start of the second mission.]

210
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,980
I doubt they hid anything
in the trash cans.

211
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,630
I'd really like to find something, too.

212
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,860
[The Human Opener opens up
every door that she comes across.]

213
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,990
- Here's something!
- Is it something heavy?

214
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,540
It needs to be heavier than this.
This isn't going to be heavy enough.

215
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,920
Here's something!

216
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,480
- What's this? This is too light.
- Is it light?

217
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,140
- It's toilet paper.
- Toilet paper?

218
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,390
[Toilet paper is going to be
way too light.]

219
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,620
- Just take it back for now.
- Should I set this down?

220
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,620
[No matter how many items are brought back,
only one item per person are allowed.]

221
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,980
Here's a tire.

222
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,540
[Oh, that's going to carry some weight.]

223
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,620
I've found something!

224
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,930
Ugh, why is this thing so heavy?

225
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,220
How do I get back down?

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,790
[Chun Hee, you haven't changed one bit...]

227
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,460
Lady Kim, this is kind of heavy.

228
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,430
[Ha Ha passes the giant stuffed bear
over to Big Sister Kim.]

229
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,600
- Go and wait for us.
- Okay.

230
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,700
Does this make me a selfish brat?

231
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,170
I really need to find something myself.

232
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,700
- Lady Kim, just go! You can just go.
- Oh my goodness.

233
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,890
Oh my goodness, she's so strong.

234
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,890
How much does it weigh?

235
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,410
10.8kg.

236
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,840
Why can't I find anything?
Oh, I've found something!

237
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,870
I've found something!

238
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,640
- Jong Kook, I've found something!
- What is it? Wow!

239
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,140
Wait, what is it?
Okay, you can just push it.

240
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,480
[A giant flower pot on wheels!]

241
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,450
- Here's something!
- What is it?

242
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,680
- It's kimchi!
- That's good.

243
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,420
- Hey, I've got kimchi!
- Hye Jung, that's great!

244
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,050
- That's a sure thing!
- That's great!

245
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,680
[Heavy and speedy!
Hye Jung makes a great discovery.]

246
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,760
[Gary arrives back with his tire.]

247
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,090
Put in on top of it.
That's a really big item.

248
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,650
31.8kg!

249
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,550
[Jae Suk returns with the water jug in
one, and a dumbbell in the other.]

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
[Hye Jung arrives with her
giant flower pot.]

251
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,420
That's really impressive.

252
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,900
Oh my goodness,
I can't believe you found that.

253
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,870
- No, one at a time.
- 18.5kg.

254
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,990
[Hye Jung's giant flower pot- 18.5kg.]

255
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,770
- Here's a snowman!
- Where?

256
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,580
[He actually stops to pick up the snowman?]

257
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,610
[Some people just never change.]

258
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,520
4.36kg.

259
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,830
[The giant teddy bear- 4.36kg.]

260
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,300
- 11.88kg.
- That's pretty heavy.

261
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,110
- Only one item per person, Jae Suk.
- I just want to see which is heavier.

262
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,140
[Jae Suk is planning on choosing
the heavier item of the two.]

263
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,240
- Which one?
- They're both around 10.

264
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,170
[Water jug- 9.8kg.
Dumbbell- 9.9kg.]

265
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,460
[How can the two items be so similar?]

266
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,240
How about this one?

267
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,420
[Chun Hee's blanket weighs 14.8kg.]

268
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,050
Jong Kook is bringing back a person.

269
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,850
- Seriously? A person is marked with an 'R'?
- What?

270
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,990
Oh my goodness.

271
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,140
[Big Sister Kim continues to
be impressed.]

272
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,120
[Kkuk brings back a life sized mannequin.]

273
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
I hope that the mannequin is heavy.

274
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,690
The Santa can hold something.

275
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,510
Press down on it.

276
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,590
You can't press down on it.

277
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,580
23.

278
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm just holding it steady
so that it doesn't fall over.

279
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,610
We already know how much it weighs.

280
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,710
[You already know how
much it weighs?]

281
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,050
- We already know the weight of it.
- Maybe he just had a nice meal.

282
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,200
- We already know how much it weighs.
- 18.7kg.

283
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,180
- Okay, Lee Kwang Soo's turn.
- You brought back toilet paper?

284
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,880
- It's really heavy toilet paper.
- You really are too much, Kwang Soo.

285
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,090
You should've just left it.

286
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,460
[The weight of the toilet paper can
determine the outcome of the mission.]

287
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,360
[Kwang Soo is practically standing
on top of the weight scale.]

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,710
- Come back down, Kwang Soo.
- It didn't work.

289
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,990
Oh my goodness... where are we
going to find something heavier?

290
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,470
Your total record is... 131.56kg.

291
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,090
Whose item didn't weight over 10kg?

292
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,040
I found your item for you.
You're really hurting my feelings.

293
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,970
- I found your item for you.
- I found Lady Kim's item for her.

294
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,970
But that item didn't even
weigh 10kg.

295
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,640
[I'm sorry.]

296
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,680
You're the one who gave her an item
that didn't weigh enough.

297
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,600
[Big Sister tries to uplift everyone's mood
by joking around about failing the mission.]

298
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,360
The size may be big,
but it's not all that heavy.

299
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,450
What is this? It's obvious
that it's not all that heavy.

300
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,640
If this is what you're going to find for her,
then don't even find her anything.

301
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,880
[Thanks to Big Sister Kim,
everyone's still in good spirits.]

302
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,420
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah, I want to become a fixed member.

303
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,870
I'm just talking rubbish.

304
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,550
Lady Kim says that she's having fun,
and she loves all the laughter.

305
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,010
She says she's having fun, and we
really love having you on our show.

306
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,400
- Really? I'm really happy right now.
- Yes, we're serious.

307
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,060
[A cozy scene to warm up a
wintery season.]

308
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,940
- I like running without having to think.
- Me, too. Seriously.

309
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,060
I really like running around.

310
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,710
I want to run around like a fool
without having to think about anything.

311
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,850
Your next mission is,
'Create the number with the dice'.

312
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,110
- This is all about luck.
- This game is about luck.

313
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,810
There will be five couples of two

314
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,600
and each member will decide who will
be the single and double digit.

315
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,930
For example, if the team rolls
a two and a five consecutively

316
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,940
then the team will end up with 25.

317
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,900
Then if the following couple rolls the dice
and the sum is bigger than the first couple

318
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,740
then you succeed the mission.

319
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,400
Then there will be five turns and
each will have to be bigger than the last?

320
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
- Then 66 will be the highest?
- Getting 66 in the middle will be a failure.

321
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,220
- Oh my.
- Don't mention failing already.

322
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,400
[Why would you mention that already?]

323
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,910
- No, we can do this.
- This has potential.

324
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,900
Should people with bad luck
partner up together?

325
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,730
Who has the worst luck
with things like this?

326
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,400
- Chun Hee and Kwang Soo...
- Those two, for sure.

327
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,990
- You, too.
- I'm pretty unlucky myself.

328
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,010
- You guys should partner up together,
- It'll be the four of us.

329
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,910
[Bad luck all-stars:
Chun Hee, Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, Jae Suk.]

330
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,000
- We have the worst luck.
- We're famous for being unlucky.

331
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
[Self-professed icons of bad luck.]

332
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,850
Would it be better for the bad luck
guys to go first?

333
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,800
- What if we roll 66 right away?
- You guys are unlucky no matter what.

334
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
Then how about we split up and
have one go first, and the other last?

335
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,540
- First bad luck, and last bad luck.
- Split you guys up?

336
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Since these two have bad luck,
and those two have filthy bad luck...

337
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,520
- We don't have filthy bad luck.
- Split them half and half.

338
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,340
- These two are really unlucky.
- Filthy bad luck.

339
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,370
Why would you say that in
front of Lady Kim?

340
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,270
Family Outing, come over here.

341
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,690
This is the original bad luck,
and that is the new filthy bad luck.

342
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,150
He's just bad luck,
and I'm the other just bad luck.

343
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,540
Is everyone teamed up in pairs?
Then hold hands with your partners.

344
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,730
- Are you my partner?
- Yes, we have to go and find the dice.

345
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,390
Ready, go!

346
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
Keep your eyes open.

347
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,330
[The two bad luck couples
are running side by side.]

348
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,950
Let's go home.
We should go up.

349
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,540
They're going upstairs, too.
Bad luck people think alike.

350
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,890
All the bad luck people must think alike.

351
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,220
[The two couples run up
to the second floor together.]

352
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,290
I don't see any dice.

353
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,150
- I don't see any.
- Where could they be?

354
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,170
Let's go back to the first floor.
I don't think there are any up here.

355
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,610
[Are they unlucky,
or are they just impatient?]

356
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,060
I think we should go back downstairs
and search to our right.

357
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,780
Why are you taking the elevator?
We don't have time for the elevator!

358
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,520
[Big-nose Brother can't resist
the comforts of civilized age.]

359
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,740
But an elevator would be faster
than taking the stairs.

360
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,380
I'd like to see you in a name tag
elimination game against lady Kim Hye Ja.

361
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,560
Have you found something?

362
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,920
[Big Sister Kim has already
found something.]

363
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,330
- Wow, we found something!
- There's something there.

364
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,160
- Oh my, no one saw the one in there?
- No, they must not have.

365
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,260
- Should we try rolling it?
- This is just practice.

366
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,710
- This is just for practice.
- Double and single digit.

367
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,320
- We need to get the lowest number possible.
- Lower is better?

368
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,010
[Lower is better.]

369
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,070
You can't throw it like that.

370
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,170
[Big Sister Kim's new way
of throwing the dice.]

371
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,970
- You're quite the jokester.
- You just rolled it to 'one.'

372
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,710
- I found one.
- You did? Let's go.

373
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,000
[Rushes back to the mission site
with her hand in Kkuk's hand.]

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,190
- We've found ours.
- Have you found it?

375
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,210
[All the couples are gathered back together.]

376
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,340
You have to decide
which couple will go first.

377
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,880
Let's have Lady Kim Hye Ja go first.

378
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,490
Then Lady Kim will have the double digit,
and Jong Kook will have single digit.

379
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,840
Okay.

380
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,840
- I need to get 'one', right? Should I go?
- Yes.

381
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,940
[First couple to go,
with Lady Kim in the double digit.]

382
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,130
[Oh no!]

383
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,840
[Addition of a special rule-
Out of bounds, so doesn't count.]

384
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,400
That was out of bounds!

385
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,090
[Big Sister Kim immediately
takes another turn.]

386
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,840
[First couple's double digit is... one!]

387
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,420
That's good, right?

388
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,160
[Big Sister Kim gets them off
to a perfect start.]

389
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,970
- That's great!
- Kim Hye Ja!

390
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,580
- She's so cute.
- 11!

391
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,820
Eleven!

392
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,040
[The lowest number- Eleven.
The best possible start.]

393
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,780
[Ji Hyo and Hye Jung's turn.]

394
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,440
Ji Hyo's going first.

395
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,780
[Second couple, Ji Hyo and Hye Jung.
Single digit number.]

396
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,150
- Please let it be one.
- Let it be one, let it be one.

397
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,470
- Let it be one.
- Two!

398
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,460
[Second couple's number, 25.]

399
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,190
[Success.
25 is greater than 11.]

400
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,290
- My turn. I'm going for the single digit.
- Is it the single digit number?

401
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:19,730
[Third couple's single digit- Four.]

402
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:28,120
[In order for it to be greater than 25,
Gary needs to roll a three or higher.]

403
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,270
One, two, three!

404
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,110
[Third couple's double digit roll.]

405
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,790
[Five.]

406
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,750
[Success]

407
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,750
- Did you get 54?
- You need to roll 55.

408
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:50,060
- I need to roll 55 or higher?
- How about 61, and you roll 62?

409
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,500
Who should go first?
Who do you think has worse luck?

410
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,430
Who looks to be most unlucky?

411
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,030
[Points to Kwang Soo without
even a moment of hesitation.]

412
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,340
- She thinks you look most unlucky.
- Should I roll first?

413
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,580
Okay, this is the single digit.

414
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,960
[Fourth couple's first digit roll.]

415
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,320
[One.]

416
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,330
[The worst case scenario.
Must roll a six in order to succeed.]

417
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,970
Why did you roll first?
Shouldn't we have agreed on it together?

418
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,860
Why did you agree to go first?

419
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,850
- Lady Kim told me to.
- You just asked me who looked most unlucky.

420
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,600
[Big Sister Kim only answered
the question asked.]

421
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,340
- No, she wasn't indicating to him.
- We're going to go first.

422
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,170
[This is good!]

423
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,000
- That wasn't your roll?
- No, it wasn't.

424
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,080
I just threw it down in anger because I was
upset at her telling me that I looked unlucky.

425
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,420
- I'm sorry.
- Kwang Soo just threw it down in anger.

426
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,300
[Kwang Soo jumped the gun
from his fit of anger.]

427
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,650
- Current number to beat is 54.
- We need to roll 56.

428
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:58,100
[Must roll a number higher than
54 in order to succeed.]

429
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,870
[Fourth couple's single digit throw.]

430
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,020
[Four.]

431
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,010
You can roll either a five or a six.
You can tie it.

432
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,600
[Tie is accepted.
Must roll either a five or a six.]

433
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,210
[Rolling a six would put a great
burden on the next couple.]

434
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,220
[Must roll a five for the sake
of winning for all the members.]

435
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,350
Please be quiet.

436
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,370
I'm not in a good mood right now,
so just go away.

437
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,540
I have to get a five.

438
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:45,500
[Fourth couple's double digit toss.]

439
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,650
[Six.]

440
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,910
[Success.]

441
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,780
- We did it.
- We're okay.

442
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,360
[Must roll either 65
or 66 to win the mission.]

443
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,900
Lady Kim, who should roll the single digit?

444
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,320
The unlucky person should roll first.

445
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,640
Then should I go first?

446
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,190
- Yes, then I'll go first.
- You have two numbers you can land on.

447
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,990
You can roll either a five or a six.

448
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,990
- Lady Kim, can you cheer for us?
- Fighting!

449
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,400
- Fighting!
- If you lose, you'll be stripped naked.

450
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,340
[Must roll either 65 or 66 to succeed.]

451
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:47,340
[The last couple's single digit toss.]

452
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,780
[6]

453
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,390
[First phase is a success.]

454
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:02,690
[No other choice but to roll
a six in order to succeed.]

455
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,080
I feel so pressured right now.
Why am I put in this position?

456
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,680
Let's just go for six, okay?

457
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,500
- Six!
- Roll a six.

458
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,710
Toss it really high into the air.

459
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,540
- All my new year's luck is going into this.
- If you lose, I'm stripping you naked.

460
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,920
- Lady Kim, give me a cheer.
- Fighting!

461
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,600
- One more time!
- Fighting!

462
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,800
[Yes, this is a real cheer!]

463
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,320
[Only six will be acceptable!]

464
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,770
Let's go!

465
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,350
[What will be the last couple's
double digit number?]

466
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,880
[1]

467
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,700
[A failed mission.]

468
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,910
Wow, we've set it all up for you,
and you've just kicked our victory away.

469
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,570
[He needed a six,
but he rolls a one instead.]

470
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,180
No, it's okay.

471
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,250
He said it's with next year's good luck,
but he's just using up next year's bad luck.

472
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,850
[Big Sister Kim's words of comfort.]

473
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,860
Since this was so much fun,
how about playing it one more time?

474
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,880
- Really?
- Look, it's a six.

475
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,290
That's why you're so unlucky.
You're just really unlucky.

476
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,870
[Big-nose throws it again.]

477
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,640
- He's going to keep rolling a six.
- See?

478
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,690
[Another six.]

479
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,040
I get a one when I needed a six.
Wow, seriously.

480
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,240
[Fails the mission so close to winning
because of Big-nose's misfortune.]

481
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,970
[Maybe I'll have better luck next year.]

482
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,360
Please give us our next mission.
This is our last chance, isn't it?

483
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,930
This is your last chance.
Here's your next mission.

484
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,380
It's 'Spin the Hoola Hoop'.

485
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,730
Everyone must find and bring back
hoola hoops of various sizes

486
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
and if everyone can last for three seconds
doing the hoola hoop, then it's a win.

487
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,800
- Ugh, this is bad.
- You may get started.

488
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,230
Ugh, what are we going to do?
I can't do the hoola hoop.

489
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,920
- I'm really bad at this.
- There's one!

490
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,450
- Give that to Lady Kim.
- Give that to Lady Kim.

491
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,290
- Give her the small one.
- Will this size be okay?

492
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,320
- I can't even do it. I should practice.
- Give it a try.

493
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,130
I've never done this before,
so I don't think I'll be able to do it.

494
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,700
Would it help if I held
your coat in the back?

495
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,120
- In case it gets caught in your coat?
- Everyone's watching.

496
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,040
- It's because it got caught in your coat.
- I'm not doing it. It's too embarrassing.

497
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,360
- Will a bigger one be better?
- I don't know.

498
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,570
- I've never done this before.
- I'm really bad at this, too.

499
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,310
No, I bet you're good at it.

500
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,320
Ugh, this is bad.

501
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,460
Lady Kim, you're really good!

502
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,830
Do you like that one,
or this one better?

503
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,280
- This one is better.
- Then you can have that one.

504
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,240
- Okay, thank you.
- You're good at it.

505
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,680
- No, I'm not good.
- This isn't working. I'm in trouble.

506
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,780
[Closes the door to practice by herself
out of her embarrassment.]

507
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,570
[Our Big Sister Kim is as sweet
and bright as a young child.]

508
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,630
[Everyone finds their hoola hoops
and gathers together to practice.]

509
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,800
I don't want to do it by myself.
Let's all do it together.

510
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,070
[Starts the group practice session.]

511
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm too embarrassed to do this.

512
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,240
- I think a heavier one would be better.
- How about spinning it with your arm?

513
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,190
How about spinning it around my neck?

514
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,650
[Spinning it around the arm or
the neck will also be accepted.]

515
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,260
- How about spinning it around the arm?
- That's fine.

516
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,190
That was done on purpose, right?

517
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,850
[Bringing lots of laughter to everyone.]

518
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,370
Okay, let's get started.
You just need to spin it around.

519
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,650
- Okay, let's do this.
- This is your final chance.

520
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,840
[Santa's Lottery Race- First mission.
Final chance.]

521
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,160
- Wouldn't a heavier one be better for her?
- Would you like this one or that one?

522
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,070
I'm going to do this one.
No, give me back that one.

523
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,600
Why would you put me in
such a difficult spot like this?

524
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,550
- You're seriously too much.
- Ready... go!

525
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,480
[No more chances will be given!]

526
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,410
[Must last for three seconds!]

527
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,350
[Big Sister Kim gives everything
she has into spinning her hoop!]

528
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,400
[3.08 seconds.
Barely succeeds the mission!]

529
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,640
[Barely manages to clear the mission
thanks to Big Sister Kim's big efforts.]

530
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,690
[Big Sister Kim's leadership guides
the team into winning the mission.]

531
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,050
Since you've succeeded you mission,
as mentioned, the drawing zone is over there.

532
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,120
Getting there within 20 seconds will be
greatly advantageous for you. Get going!

533
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,370
We have to rush over there.

534
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,220
This way.

535
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,910
[Everyone must get there within
20 seconds for it to be a success.]

536
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,470
[Everyone's holding Big Sister Kim's
hand to help her along.]

537
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,500
Mom and dad to little kids
are always the fastest.

538
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,720
- Because we never know what could happen.
- Always on the move.

539
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,680
I'm keeping your place for you.

540
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,180
[All the members arrive
at the drawing zone.]

541
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,980
[A drawing machine sits
in the middle of the drawing zone.]

542
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,220
[What is the meaning of
these balls?]

543
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,040
I'll explain the drawing rules for you.

544
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,930
During the race, you will draw from
the machine at the end of each mission.

545
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,640
There are a total of seven figures
which you'll be drawing for.

546
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,300
Since it's the end of the first mission,
you'll draw for the 10,000 Won spot.

547
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,050
- For the 10,000 Won?
- Yes, for the 10,000 Won spot.

548
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,340
If you draw a zero,
then you've drawn zero Won.

549
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,520
But if you draw a nine,
then you've drawn 90,000 Won.

550
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,130
- I think they're going to give us money.
- There are numbers zero through nine.

551
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,980
Then the highest number possible
would be all nines?

552
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,220
If you were to pick all nines,
then you'd get 999 million Won.

553
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,510
I said that you needed to
get here within 20 seconds

554
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,180
but it took you 38 seconds to get here.

555
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,580
We lost time because we were helping
Lady Kim on the way here.

556
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,420
So there won't be any additional balls.

557
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,130
- If you had arrived within 20 seconds...
- That's okay though, isn't it?

558
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,590
- You could've added another nine ball.
- That's okay, Lady Kim.

559
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,840
[Arriving within 20 seconds would've
added another nine ball into the mix.]

560
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,520
[After the success of first mission,
can choose from 1-9 balls.]

561
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,930
[The balls are rolling around with gusto.]

562
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,720
[Which numbered ball
will they choose for the first slot?]

563
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,520
[Number eight!]

564
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,320
[With the draw of the first number,
80,000 Won is earned.]

565
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,510
80,000 Won.

566
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,830
You have drawn 80,000 Won so far
in the Santa's lottery drawing.

567
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,280
[Will this happy start continue on
until the end of the race?]

568
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,730
[The greatest gift is the ability to
share the joy with others.]

569
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,130
- I think Lady Kim really likes you.
- I'm her eldest son.

570
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,050
- Why are you her eldest son?
- Won Bin is her second eldest.

571
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,080
[Everyone is each other's siblings.]

572
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,870
She's just amazed to see people like you
after seeing someone as handsome as Won Bin.

573
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,060
- I really enjoyed watching your drama.
- You are such an amazing actress.

574
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,930
You played a mother who believed
in her son all the way to the end.

575
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,150
Even if a son were to do such a thing,
his mother would always believe in him.

576
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,220
Because she's his mom.

577
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,910
[Santa's Lottery Race- Second mission]

578
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,480
- It's a Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo?

579
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,360
- Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo quiz?

580
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,490
If you look behind you...

581
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,530
- Why are there so many numbers?
- There are so many spaces!

582
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,130
There are nine spaces across,
and nine spaces down.

583
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,030
There are a total of 81 spaces
with corresponding answers.

584
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,870
Why are there so many questions?

585
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:19,270
One person will ask the questions
and the remaining nine will answer

586
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,960
to complete at least one bingo line
in order to win the mission.

587
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,580
[Even one completed bingo line
would equate to winning the mission.]

588
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,630
[All nine members must correctly
answer the question.]

589
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,620
[What's with the expression
on their faces?]

590
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,370
The topic of this quiz is 'Popular
toy items for this year's Christmas'.

591
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,300
That should be easy since
this isn't about general knowledge.

592
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,570
This is just about things.

593
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,320
Since we're already on this subject,
what is it that you'd like, Gary?

594
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,990
Oh my, there's a Gary here?

595
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,680
Oh my, I'm sorry.

596
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,670
Gary is the name of the dog
in my movie.

597
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,000
[This is that Gary.]

598
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,800
- I'm in your movie?
- Wally's real name is Gary.

599
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,350
[Wally's real name is Gary.]

600
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,280
Whatever the case,
it's nice to make your acquaintance.

601
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,270
Is there anything
that you'd like for Christmas?

602
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,620
Me?
Well, I... I want to be loved.

603
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,670
[A working mom's humble wish.]

604
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,210
What about you, Chun Hee?

605
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,730
I want a laptop.

606
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,300
You don't have one?

607
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,070
- I just want a new one.
- Just buy one.

608
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,550
Why would you buy a laptop
if you already have one?

609
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,660
Lady Kim sounded like
she really pitied him when she said

610
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,830
'Do you not have one?'

611
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,060
Chun Hee, she must've
found you really pitiful.

612
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,740
[Maybe this mother may just buy him
his new laptop.]

613
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,580
- I'll ask the first question.
- Okay, Ha Ha can ask the questions.

614
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,840
- Then I'll answer the first question.
- I'll answer the eighth question.

615
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,470
- I'll go after Ji Hyo.
- Lady Kim can go last.

616
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,020
That way, you can see how others
are doing it in front of you.

617
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,460
Yes, I can do that.

618
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,210
Then you can see how things progress,
and you can gauge how it's done.

619
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:25,400
Okay, then you must now decide which
line you're going to go for.

620
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,800
- Number one!
- Let's just start from the beginning.

621
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,120
- Let's start with one and go diagonal.
- Yes.

622
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,190
- Yes.
- From one through nine.

623
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,990
- Let's get this done on first try.
- Fighting!

624
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,930
- Fighting!
- Let's get this done on first try.

625
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,950
- Let's get this done on first try.
- I'm so nervous.

626
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,540
[100 seconds on the clock.
Bingo Quiz- First attempt.]

627
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:52,470
The thing that beeps from the front
and back in the newer suv's...

628
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,820
The front and rear sensors.

629
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
[She got that on first try?]

630
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:04,970
New front and rear sensor
equipped SUV!

631
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,540
[Huh?
Blank Ji is actually this smart?]

632
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,240
- Okay, move up.
- You knew all that?

633
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,400
I don't know any of that stuff.

634
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,930
What's your favorite tree?

635
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,680
An ash tree?

636
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,850
[Huh? What tree?]

637
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,510
[Ash... what?]

638
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,560
- He likes ash trees?
- Yes, ash trees.

639
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,450
- How big of a family do you want to have?
- Six.

640
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,430
Right?
Then combine all that together.

641
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,590
A six person table
made out of ash trees?

642
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,450
- A six person table?
- Okay!

643
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,280
What is it?

644
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,760
- The questions are so easy.
- You like six person tables?

645
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:59,690
[Have they always been this smart?]

646
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,500
[Just what is this situation?]

647
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,840
[Two hours before the opening.]

648
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,260
[A bakery near the opening scene.]

649
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:16,530
- There's one more guest that'll be coming.
- Really?

650
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,600
- There's one more guest?
- There's a reason why you all are here.

651
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:27,210
We've asked you to meet here because there's
a secret mission that you'll have to do.

652
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,210
- You'll be asked to play a Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo quiz?

653
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:36,400
There'll be a hidden camera mission in which
only Lady Kim Hye Ja will get a question wrong

654
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,750
and deter the team from getting a bingo line,
and that's how you'll succeed the mission.

655
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,970
If Lady Kim guesses during the mission
that there's a hidden camera

656
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,870
or if she correctly guesses the answer
to complete a bingo line

657
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,750
then you will all fail
the hidden camera mission.

658
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,700
And if you fail to answer the question
correctly, then you also fail the mission.

659
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:05,330
Please take a look at the bingo questions
and do you best to memorize the answers.

660
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,890
[These nine members will now have to
work to memorize all the answers.]

661
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,460
- We have to study again?
- You'll be given the time to study right now.

662
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,500
- Please start studying.
- These are the questions.

663
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,790
- And these are the questions.
- How am I supposed to know these answers?

664
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,500
[The questions and its corresponding
answers sound like alien language.]

665
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,170
- How am I supposed to know this?
- These are hard questions.

666
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,180
Listen to this.

667
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,660
The jacket that boasts its waterproof feature
as well as for being lightweight and warm?

668
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,510
- Is it goose down?
- No, ultralight down jacket with padding.

669
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,930
[How are we supposed to know this?]

670
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:45,200
- I've never met Lady Kim Hye Ja before.
- I've never met her either.

671
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,190
She's like a sweet young girl.
To be honest, I doubt she'll know these.

672
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,030
I doubt she'll know what a six cylinder
battery series engine is.

673
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,280
What is she knows?
'This is a six cylinder battery series engine.'

674
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,700
She could have a lot of interest in cars.

675
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,100
- She could know this.
- Maybe she likes sports cars.

676
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,510
- We need to come up with a good plan.
- We need to be detailed about this.

677
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,880
- Should we go up or down?
- It could be diagonal, too.

678
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,040
- There's a diagonal line.
- Let's go diagonally.

679
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,780
Just think about it.

680
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,300
- Come on.
- Do you not have a brain?

681
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,640
- Just do it.
- It's because you seem to lack a brain.

682
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,720
- You must not use your brain very much.
- Excuse me?

683
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,230
Do you think that my brain
is just for decoration?

684
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,440
[Unstable factor number one-
Members can't seem to agree on anything.]

685
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,950
- We just need to memorize one line.
- That's what I'm saying.

686
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,710
- Let's just memorize one line.
- That's what I'm saying!

687
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,960
[How many times must we repeat
saying the same thing?]

688
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,090
[There seems to be no sign
of any progress at this meeting.]

689
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,120
We're just going to give up
on this mission.

690
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:51,240
- Do we just need one bingo line?
- If you get a bingo line, then you fail.

691
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,230
We have to get a bingo?

692
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,810
No, we can't get a bingo line.
If we do, then we fail the mission.

693
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,470
[30th time explaining the rules of the game.]

694
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,440
What do you think, Chun Hee?

695
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,390
I'm not really sure what's going on yet.

696
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,420
You didn't know during Family Outing,
and you still don't know. When will you know?

697
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,170
[Unstable factor number two-
Goofy Brothers can't understand the mission.]

698
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,760
At this rate, we're not going to get back
in time to greet Lady Kim Hye Ja.

699
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,470
[They waste away all their study time...]

700
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,060
[And now they rush.]

701
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,990
[Are they studying for their SAT's?]

702
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,050
Isn't there a single smart person here?
This shouldn't be this difficult.

703
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,490
It's just because none of us like to study.

704
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,890
- This is too bothersome.
- Seriously!

705
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,800
[Unstable factor number three-
Members are too lazy to study.]

706
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,310
- That's not the problem.
- There are too many questions.

707
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,740
- How about we memorize one each?
- Let's divide the questions.

708
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,760
[Just then, Big-nose proposes that
they memorize one question each.]

709
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,170
Ha Ha can ask the questions,
and Ji Hyo can memorize the first question.

710
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,800
- How about Lady Kim goes second?
- Lady Kim can go second.

711
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,320
- Okay.
- How about we go in this order?

712
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,830
[Their current seating is the order.]

713
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,790
[Rehearsing how the quiz will go.]

714
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:11,030
- The front and rear sensor...
- New SUV's anterior sensors.

715
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,980
[Blank Ji's correct answer is the result
of the rehearsal they practiced earlier.]

716
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,500
- What is your favorite tree?
- The ash tree?

717
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,660
Why do you like the ash tree?

718
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,270
Have you even seen that tree before?

719
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,740
[Extremely unnatural answer to
a question- That ash tree?]

720
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,550
It's your favorite tree!
The tree you most like.

721
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,810
[Things are going along exactly
how they rehearsed it.]

722
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,110
- You don't think Lady Kim will notice?
- We're definitely going to fail this.

723
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,770
We have to do a good job
so that she doesn't catch on.

724
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,850
[Will this candid camera mission succeed?]

725
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,860
[Their studying session continues
during their drive to the opening site.]

726
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,710
I'm not going to study.

727
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,880
I'm going to go with my gut feeling.

728
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,610
[Even after having arrived
at the opening location.]

729
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:13,720
[Member prepares for the mission by
writing cheat notes onto their skin.]

730
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,720
[Even right up to the point of
the mission starting...]

731
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,470
[They continue to study in secret.]

732
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:33,300
[That's how they finished
preparing for their secret mission.]

733
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,440
[This is how the mission got underway.]

734
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,590
- It's made with your favorite tree.
- A six person ash tree table?

735
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,960
[Ash tree what?
First time ever hearing such a thing!]

736
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
[These young people are
much smarter than I had thought.]

737
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,640
I don't understand a single thing
that's being said.

738
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,920
It's my favorite!

739
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,530
[They don't know any of this either.]

740
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,660
- Burgundy... red wine?
- That's right, burgundy?

741
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,890
[I didn't know that Chun Hee
liked burgundy red wine.]

742
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,190
[Extremely excited.]

743
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,330
[Oh my goodness.]

744
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,150
[Repeating the answer to himself
in case he forgets it.]

745
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,020
- The really big...
- Halla Mountain!

746
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,620
Halla mountain's aquifer that's
500m above sea level?

747
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,070
That's right!

748
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,930
How am I supposed to know
something like that?

749
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,090
[We've never heard it before
today either.]

750
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,380
You can do this!

751
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,590
You gave this to your wife
as a Christmas gift last year.

752
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,260
[The thing Yoo Hyuk gave his wife
as a Christmas gift last year?]

753
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,840
- It was a bracelet of some sort.
- Oh, that one!

754
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,650
A 16 carat white diamond bracelet!

755
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,710
Wow, you're a great husband.

756
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,620
You told your wife that you'd take her
camping this year, right?

757
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,690
- The thing that you use while camping...
- Portable pots and pans!

758
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,940
But you know that thing...
it comes in a set!

759
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,300
- Stainless...
- Hurry!

760
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,380
[He hasn't... forgotten his answer,
has he?]

761
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,440
- It comes in a set!
- Stainless portable pots and pan set!

762
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,360
[Finally gets the correct answer.]

763
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,050
Oh my goodness, I have no idea
what any of you are saying.

764
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,220
- You know that mountain?
- Jiri mountain?

765
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,110
Remember the thing I said would make
me really strong if I were to eat it?

766
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,060
- Mountain ginseng?
- How old are the really effective ginseng?

767
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,280
- 25 year old Jiri mountain ginseng?
- That's right!

768
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,770
[What is going on here?]

769
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,010
- Calm down.
- This is popular these days.

770
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,660
[Already knows the answer before
the question is even asked.]

771
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,690
- It's waterproof and really warm.
- Ultralight down jacket with padding?

772
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,660
- That's right!
- That was right?

773
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,590
- It's Lady Kim's turn.
- We have faith in you!

774
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:09,400
[It's finally her turn.
Correct answer, and they fail the mission.]

775
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,490
<i>How about we ask the question in such a way
that she'd never get the correct answer?</i>

776
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:18,640
<i>If it looks like she knows the answer,
then we can start to confuse her.</i>

777
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,630
[1. Purposely make the question confusing.
2. Divert her attention in moment of danger.]

778
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,270
Front and the rear wheels
are shiny and bright.

779
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,720
The kickboards are really shiny.
You all know this one, right?

780
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,160
[Glow in the dark front and rear kickboard.]

781
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,490
- You're asking it too hard!
- Ask the question simpler.

782
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:41,280
What's the name of the board
that shines and glows?

783
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,830
[Time over.]

784
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,610
[Everyone starts to chastise Ha Ha as soon
as the game ends to avoid her catching on.]

785
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,850
I practically gave you the answer.
It's a glow in the dark kickboard.

786
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,040
- Then you should've told me that.
- I basically did.

787
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,930
- No, you didn't tell her.
- You need to apologize to her.

788
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,350
No, it's okay.
It's because I didn't know.

789
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,920
- He couldn't have explained it any better.
- Glow in the dark front and rear kickboard.

790
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,700
[They did succeed the first round...]

791
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,390
The final question was way too hard.

792
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,100
[Everyone seems to be nervous
that Lady Kim may catch on.]

793
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,240
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay, you did great.

794
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,410
- Okay, you get how it's done now?
- The question was hard.

795
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,330
- The answer is within the question?
- Yes, that's right.

796
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,800
[Thanks to Big Sister Kim
for always being so positive.]

797
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,280
- This is a very simple game.
- We took too long with our answers.

798
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,350
- How about we have Lady Kim go first?
- Okay.

799
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,240
[For the next round,
Lady Kim is designated to go first.]

800
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,320
Okay.

801
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,760
<i>- Then let's move our spots around.
- Okay.</i>

802
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,530
[Change of position was already
decided during the rehearsal.]

803
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,240
<i>- How about we swap and have her go first?
- That's right.</i>

804
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,500
<i>- That's right.
- Then we'll fail right away.</i>

805
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,900
<i>Then we don't even have to
memorize this line!</i>

806
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,070
[Yay, we don't have to study!]

807
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,740
[This is the plan they came up with
to have Hye Ja go first.]

808
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,360
- Okay.
- I'll explain it very slowly.

809
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,920
[Chun Hee to ask the questions this time.]

810
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,800
- We'll start with question number 21.
- Fighting.

811
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,540
[Do a good job, Chun Hee.]

812
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,860
Give me a minute.

813
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,740
- Are you feeling nervous?
- My mouth feels parched.

814
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,410
- You can take your time.
- Don't worry, we've got you.

815
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,540
- Explain it to her slowly.
- Fighting!

816
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,280
[Unstable Chun Hee-
Will he be able to do it right?]

817
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,280
Set, go!

818
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,660
Wow, this one is really hard.

819
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,250
[Carcharodontosauridae figure.]

820
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,320
[Unable to even talk.]

821
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,480
- Hurry up!
- Say something.

822
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,060
You don't know it either?

823
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,650
[Even the team members can't figure out
whether he's acting, or if he's serious.]

824
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,680
- You have to say something.
- Hurry up and explain it.

825
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,320
- Is it hard?
- It's a toy, Lady Kim.

826
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,720
Leave out the 'Lady Kim.'

827
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,220
- Just talk.
- She's saying there's no time.

828
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,180
- But...
- She's saying not to say 'Lady Kim.'

829
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,930
- It's a toy?
- It's an ancient dinosaur.

830
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,850
- Just say something.
- There's something before the dinosaur.

831
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,930
- This is...
- How about just the first word?

832
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,530
- Be quiet.
- It's a six syllable word.

833
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,750
It's a six syllable word?

834
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,640
A baby dinosaur?

835
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,750
[This one?]

836
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,960
It's blah blah blah,
and blah blah blah.

837
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,540
- What is that?
- What's that supposed to be?

838
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,550
[Just say something.]

839
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,260
I've never heard of it before either.
I'll explain it one at a time.

840
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,320
- First syllable is... 'car' in English is?
- Car.

841
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,270
Yes, that's the first part.

842
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,470
He's driving me crazy.

843
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,400
[Already past the one minute mark.]

844
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,160
- There's no time.
- We never should've had Chun Hee do it.

845
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,790
[Hang in there a little bit longer,
Chun Hee!]

846
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,560
There's a letter in the middle,
and there are double syllables.

847
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,950
- Cane?
- Mone?

848
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,990
What's he doing?

849
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,160
[Even his own teammates
are embarrassed for him.]

850
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,610
You can't even ask the question!

851
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,240
[If all this truly is just an act,
then it's some amazing acting.]

852
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,620
- Ugh, he's so frustrating.
- Lee Chun Hee, do you want to die?

853
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,510
[Not much time left on the clock.]

854
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,070
- Car...
- Yes, and then...

855
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,080
[Time's up!]

856
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,800
- It's a really tough question!
- That was just absurd!

857
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,760
- Carcharodontosauridae figurine.
- That is a tough question.

858
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,470
- That's a real tough question.
- I don't even know what that's saying.

859
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,470
What kind of a question was that?

860
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,810
That was an unreasonable question
for them to have you ask.

861
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,990
[It's normal for you
not to know the answer.]

862
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,500
- Who would even know this?
- That was disappointing.

863
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,480
- That was just absurd.
- That was too tough of a question.

864
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,480
- Let's just redo it.
- I think they want us to get it wrong.

865
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,530
I think they want us to get it wrong.

866
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,470
[Excuse me?]

867
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:07,230
[She couldn't have... noticed it?]

868
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,840
I think they're asking these questions
to make it funny, don't you think?

869
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,970
So that you can't even explain
the question and it's funnier.

870
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,860
So that you can't even explain
the question and it's funnier.

871
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:25,470
- Okay, I get it now.
- Do you get it now?

872
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,530
[Such a close call.]

873
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,700
- I think she gets it now.
- Ugh, it's hot.

874
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,040
[Happy Big Sister Kim keeps all the
members on the edge of their seats.]

875
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,330
- Why don't you come over here?
- This is my new spot.

876
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,910
Which order should we go in?

877
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,990
- How about going down the eight line?
- From number 26 and down.

878
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,510
- Then we just need to get seven questions.
- That's right.

879
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,080
- We've already got two of the questions.
- Fighting!

880
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,080
[After a loud cheer...]

881
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,640
[Whew, that was a close call.]

882
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,660
Ready, set, go!

883
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,170
If there are six members in my family,
what kind of a rice cooker would I use?

884
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,900
Six person automatic...
Six person automatic rice pressure cooker!

885
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,380
Bingo!

886
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:15,290
The breed of dog I used to have
and it was at my wedding!

887
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,060
- Bichon frise!
- Bingo!

888
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,430
[Hye Jung is really good.]

889
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,690
The ingredient that's known to be
very good for your skin.

890
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,780
- Undiluted hyaluronic acid ample!
- Bingo!

891
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,470
[What was that?]

892
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,940
- It's not a manual.
- Automatic!

893
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,370
- And it's bad...
- Kerosene!

894
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:37,370
- And it gets rid of the moisture.
- A dehumidifier!

895
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,930
- Put those two together!
- Automatic ionic sterilizing dehumidifier!

896
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,860
- Oh my goodness.
- I've always wanted one of those.

897
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,260
[Shocking that Kwang Soo got it.]

898
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,530
It's an anti-aging face cream
that really pulls things tighter.

899
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,860
- Hybrid anti-aging cream?
- That's right!

900
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,640
- How did you know that?
- I use it at home.

901
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,780
- I always use it at home.
- You use it, too?

902
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,720
- It's harmless...
- Non-toxic?

903
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,380
Yes, it's like a non-toxic glue stick.

904
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,160
Wait, it's a non-toxic...

905
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:16,830
[He couldn't have...
forgotten the answer?]

906
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,130
[Non-toxic super glue stick.]

907
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,370
Ugh, it's at the tip of my tongue!

908
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,180
[Attempting to cheat
at a moment of danger.]

909
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,080
[If he gets caught, then it's all over!]

910
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,790
[But Ha Ha blocks her view with his back,
and fortunately avoids getting caught.]

911
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:41,170
Is it a non-toxic super glue stick?

912
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,960
- That's right!
- Yes!

913
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,510
[Hye Jung gives a strong reaction to
avoid Hye Ja noticing anything amiss.]

914
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:56,210
Lady Kim, this is a household appliance
that is similar to a refrigerator.

915
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,930
[A freestanding air conditioner.]

916
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,980
[We just need to last for 15 more seconds.]

917
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,010
- It can be on the wall, too.
- Is it a wall decor?

918
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,840
This is... um...

919
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,810
[Hye Jung suddenly starts to stutter after
having done so well up to this point.]

920
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,640
This is a freestanding thing.

921
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,380
- It's freestanding?
- Yes, it's freestanding.

922
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,930
- It's freestanding?
- A freestanding air conditioner?

923
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,970
A freestanding air conditioner?

924
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,310
[Even with the confusing explanation,
she still gets close to the exact answer!]

925
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,250
[They even practiced this question!]

926
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:33,240
<i>- I have one at my house, too, and it's...
- Time's up!</i>

927
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,930
<i>I think you're going to have to practice
how to make the question more difficult.</i>

928
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,080
<i>Since there's a time limit,
how about we take longer at the start?</i>

929
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,910
<i>- So that she doesn't have much time.
- Stall more in the beginning?</i>

930
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,260
<i>But making this difficult
is going to be the hard part.</i>

931
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,580
[Even with all the confusion,
she almost gets the exact answer!]

932
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,690
[Ugh, we're ruined!]

933
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,670
[Candid camera quiz is in danger!]

934
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,760
- A freestanding air conditioner?
- It's not just your regular air conditioner.

935
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,290
It's a little...

936
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,250
[Time fortunately runs out
in the midst of extreme danger.]

937
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:15,100
[A little better explanation, then she
would've gotten the exact answer!]

938
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,950
- A heating and cooling.
- Wow, that was so close!

939
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,670
- It's a heating and cooling system.
- Can't this one count?

940
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,430
- She was so close to the answer!
- This one should count.

941
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,730
It's because I don't like being hot.

942
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,670
[Big Sister Kim doesn't like things
to make her feel hot.]

943
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,170
She doesn't like to feel hot,
so why would you ask this question?

944
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,140
- She had the answer.
- That's basically getting the question right.

945
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,210
- I really don't like being hot.
- You seem to like air conditioners.

946
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,980
- I don't like being hot.
- I really don't like heaters either.

947
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,480
She got that right away.

948
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,410
[Such a smart mother.
Almost failed their candid camera mission.]

949
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,650
- We're almost there!
- We've almost got it.

950
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,390
[Success of our mission is almost here.]

951
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,010
- We're almost there.
- We've got this.

952
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,440
- Should I go?
- What's almost there?

953
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,950
[Everyone freezes in their spots.]

954
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,450
What's almost there?

955
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,260
[Everyone freezes at her question.]

956
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,710
- Just that we almost have a bingo line.
- One more round, and we may have it.

957
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,000
- We're almost there to getting it right.
- We may get it at the next round.

958
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,400
- This is our last chance.
- This is the last round?

959
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,390
Let's get it done this time.

960
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,730
[Will they be able to successfully complete
the candid camera mission?]

961
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:31,470
[Guys, one more mistake,
and it's all over for us!]

962
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,210
- Who's good at explaining things?
- Who wants to ask this time?

963
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,290
[It's your turn.]

964
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,370
- Why doesn't Kwang Soo do it?
- Kwang Soo, you give it a try.

965
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,880
[The unlucky guy's turn?]

966
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,750
[Kwang Soo is tagged in.
Will their gamble succeed?]

967
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,100
[From question number 23 and down.]

968
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,940
- Wow, these are easy questions.
- Good, this is our chance.

969
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,880
- This is our chance, Lady Kim.
- Ready, set, go!

970
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,900
[Candid camera bingo quiz-
Final round.]

971
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,120
It's a bracelet...

972
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,660
[A bracelet?]

973
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,940
It's a bracelet.

974
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,710
[He's supposed to ask the
23rd question.]

975
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:10,650
[But he's asking question number five
that's already been asked earlier.]

976
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,250
[That's the question I answered earlier.]

977
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:19,860
The thing I found by eating baby food?

978
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,390
[Ready to go baby food pouches.]

979
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,620
- Kwang Soo...
- Isn't it baby food?

980
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,640
- Kwang Soo, you've got the wrong question.
- You have to start with question 23.

981
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,410
[Bad luck guy gets abused on.]

982
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:37,350
The baby food that my baby likes.

983
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:40,530
Jae Suk already got the 16 carat
diamond bracelet question.

984
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,590
[Ugh, he's so frustrating.]

985
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,600
My baby food.
The baby food that I like.

986
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,850
- What is he doing?
- What is it?

987
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,970
It's a really expensive baby food!

988
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:57,180
- I think I know!
- I'm going to feed this to my future baby.

989

- I'm going to feed this to my future baby.
- Ready to go baby food pouches!

990
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,560
Okay, that's the correct answer!

991
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,270
- What are you doing?
- You're not asking the right questions!

992
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,180
Just ask the next question.

993
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,050
[At this rate, time is going to run out
before it gets to Hye Ja's turn.]

994
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,160
During the Joseon era...

995
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,610
[Joseon era?]

996
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:20,060
- It's a keychain bed.
- What is he doing?

00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,180
What is he doing?

[Buckle field cot.]

999
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,670
It's a bed from the Joseon era.

1000
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,540
Are you talking about a buckle?

1001
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,350
[A brand new quiz style where the answer
has to be tailored to the question.]

1002
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,300
- Buckle field cot?
- Okay, that's the correct answer.

1003
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,070
[What was that?]

1004
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:43,510
- Hurry up!
- A car that spouts water.

1005
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,740
Water that spouts from the car.

1006

[Direct injection turbo engine
convertible.]

1007
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,840
The engine spouts out water, too.

1008
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,400
- It spouts out water?
- Yes, from the top and from the engine.

1009
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,460
It spouts water when you spin it.

1010
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,380
[It sounds like a transformer car.]

1011
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,830
- Turbo engine convertible.
- Okay!

1012
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,210
- How did you know that?
- What was that?

1013
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,160
- A car that spouts water?
- You have to explain it better!

1014
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,500
[Even Chun Hee starts to yell
at Kwang Soo.]

1015
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,560
[Get yourself together!]

1016
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,320
What is he doing?

1017
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,690
[Something's very weird...]

1018
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,070
- It's a sort of a car.
- Has he lost his mind?

1019
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,110
[We're the idiots for
having trusted Kwang Soo.]

1020
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,320
- What is he talking about?
- Good for the body and purification.

1021
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,740
[He should be able to get a gauge
for what the answer is by now.]

1022
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,680
- It's in the coffee, but not here.
- Caffeine?

1023
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,670
Tea.

1024
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,970
Eco-friendly and caffeine free
five variety tea set?

1025
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,280
[But he still answers it correctly.]

1026
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,700
[From Hye Ja's point of view,
Gary is a true genius.]

1027
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,130
- I know what this one is!
- What is it?

1028
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,910
It's the thing I gave you as
a Christmas gift last year!

1029
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,970
- Timing humidifier?
- No, it's not 'timing.'

1030
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,020
No, it's not 'timing.'

1031
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,650
[It's not?]

1032
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,770
[Reaches for his cheat sheet
in the sleeve.]

1033
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,130
[Big-nose forgot the answer.]

1034
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:12,000
- What are you guys doing!
- You got the humidifier part.

1035
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,180
- Humidifier with automatic timer.
- Okay!

1036
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,500
[Barely manages to escape the danger.]

1037
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,890
What is this monitor called?

1038
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,310
What do you call this monitor?

1039
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,200
[Time fortunately runs out.]

1040
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,730
[Barely manages to succeed
the candid camera mission.]

1041
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,970
[Almost failed the mission no thanks
to Big-nosed Brother.]

1042
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,950
- How could you have forgotten the timer?
- Timing and timer...

1043
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,980
- I gave you one as a gift last year.
- What are you guys doing?

1044
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:47,600
This isn't your fault, Lady Kim.
They wasted so much time.

1045
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,380
- You did really well.
- But I didn't even do anything.

1046
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,670
[I'm sorry, Lady Kim.]

1047
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,200
As a team, you succeeded your mission.

1048
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,040
[Kim Hye Ja's candid camera mission
is a success!]

1049
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,980
[What did we succeed?]

1050
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,680
- The truth is...
- We'll tell you down on our knees.

1051
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,570
[Everyone gets down on their knees.]

1052
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,040
[Me, too?]

1053
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,040
[Our mother is so innocent
right to the very end.]

1054
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,980
We all met about two hours before the day,
and we memorized all these answers.

1055
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,850
We've already known all the answers.

1056
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,770
Then why did you get it wrong?

1057
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,460
- You were supposed to get it wrong.
- Here, have a seat.

1058
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,570
- Have a seat here.
- Sit down here.

1059
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:36,200
[It's time to fess up.]

1060
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,840
- We already knew all the answers.
- We've studied the questions.

1061
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,880
- That was our mission.
- Didn't you think we got the answers easily?

1062
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,090
- Those were some hard questions.
- I thought you were all just very smart.

1063
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,600
[We wish that was the case.]

1064
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,650
- That was what we studied.
- We wrote cheat notes on our hands.

1065
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,050
- They're all written on our hands.
- Oh my!

1066
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,900
Oh my, it was a candid camera.

1067
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,760
Our mission was to make sure
that you got all the answers wrong.

1068
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,680
Then you succeeded.

1069
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,120
We all succeeded together!

1070
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,900
[Mother laughs it all off.]

1071
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,480
But instead of getting frustrated,
you look so happy about it.

1072
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,830
We only succeeded our mission
because it was your candid camera.

1073
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,550
- You don't mind?
- It's fun!

1074
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:22,830
[What a generous lady.]

1075
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,490
- I had no idea.
- You didn't know?

1076
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:27,640
- You didn't think it was weird?
- I didn't think it was weird at all.

1077
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,890
I was just amazed at how good
everyone was.

1078
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,260
But you almost got the
air conditioner question right.

1079
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,030
Had you answered the correctly,
we would've failed the mission.

1080
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,090
Really?
That would've been bad!

1081
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,900
[Members are feeling worse because she's
truly happy they succeeded their mission.]

1082
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,510
- You're making us feel even worse.
- She really is an angel.

1083
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,690
I can't get upset over something like that.

1084
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,340
[Angel Hye Ja.]

1085
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,180
- This isn't something to be upset over.
- I made it more difficult on purpose.

1086
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,670
[But...]

1087
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,920
But I'm never going to let
you fool me again.

1088
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,450
[So positive right up to the end.]

1089
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,790
This is really fun.

1090
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:09,550
Since you've succeeded your mission,
you can draw from one through nine.

1091
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,870
[After wrapping up the candid mission,
it's time for another drawing.]

1092
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,360
[Santa's lottery race-
All the numbers are added into the pool.]

1093
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,730
[Oldest Running Man member,
Big-nose does the drawing.]

1094
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,450
Pull it.

1095
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,720
[Number one is chosen.]

1096
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,170
- How could that even happen?
- Guys, the next number is most important.

1097
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,390
Your face is beet red right now.

1098
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,210
[Big-nose doesn't even know
what to say.]

1099
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,030
Life can be that way.

1100
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,190
[You can't always get what
you want in life.]

1101
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,020
- That's what he's like.
- He just threw away 800,000 Won.

1102
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,010
[It could've been 980,000 Won.]

1103
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,890
We still have a chance.

1104
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,920
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

1105
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,740
I'll keep in touch from now on.

1106
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:08,610
- Don't think about bothering her.
- Call your own parents once in a while.

1107
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,960
- Call your own parents.
- I'll check in on you once in a while.

1108
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,060
[Don't forget to call your own parents
once in a while.]

1109
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,430
[Christmas is the time for
loving and caring for others.]

1110
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,800
[Nine giant sized bells!]

1111
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,710
It must be real flour.

1112
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,330
- It must be real flour.
- What is it this time?

1113
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,260
It's time for the final mission of the race.

1114
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,660
Your final mission is,
'Yes, this is the sentence.'

1115
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,920
I have a bad feeling about this.

1116
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,720
Lady Kim, please step forward.

1117
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,290
What do I have to do?

1118
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:58,140
The rest of the members can take a spot
underneath the bells behind you.

1119
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,870
Your final mission is very simple.

1120
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:04,490
Lady Kim will determine the members' fates.

1121
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,500
Can you please tell me what kind
of a cellphone you have?

1122
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,360
- What type of a cellphone do you use?
- I use a smartphone.

1123
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,590
- You use a smartphone?
- That's great.

1124
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,440
- Why?
- Here's your mission.

1125
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:25,950
Lady Kim must send a text message exactly
as what she is told within 30 seconds.

1126
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,330
If she sends it accurately within that time,
then you avoid receiving the flour penalty.

1127
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,120
But if she goes over the time limit

1128
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,200
or if she gets the text inaccurately,
then you'll receive the flour penalty.

1129
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,930
The thing you must remember is

1130
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:45,030
you must utilize the exact spacing and
emoticons as you're instructed to.

1131
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:49,640
If she gets it right on the first try,
then everyone will pass successfully.

1132
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,480
Lady Kim's text will be shown on the screen
behind you as she writes.

1133
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,770
[Lady Kim's text will be shown on the screen
behind them in real time.]

1134
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:01,880
- Take your time, and you should be fine.
- You text often, do you not?

1135
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,790
I'm very good at texting.

1136
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,780
- We're all set!
- This is good.

1137
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,240
[We'll be fine!]

1138
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,500
This is really great.

1139
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,490
[We have our faith in you!]

1140
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,610
As mentioned before, she will be given
30 seconds per text message.

1141
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,840
[Will she be able to accurately
text within those 30 seconds?]

1142
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,460
- I have to get all the punctuations, too?
- Yes.

1143
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:32,220
Comma, spacing, and everything else
has to be exactly the same.

1144
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,660
I normally don't use things like that.

1145
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,520
She's saying that she doesn't
like the use of emoticons.

1146
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,000
Who out there uses all those
punctuations?

1147
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,440
[But the rules of the game
must be followed.]

1148
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,590
- You can just relax and take it easy.
- Please do not worry about us.

1149
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,990
The final numerical drawing all
depends on the outcome of this mission.

1150
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,350
- Lady Kim, fighting!
- Fighting!

1151
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:54,160
Fighting!

1152
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,100
Here's your first text message.

1153
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,530
[Rudolph the reindeer's red nose
is a very shiny nose.]

1154
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,710
[Spacing is very crucial!]

1155
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,780
- Wow, she's fast.
- She's really good at it.

1156
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,900
Is there a space between that?

1157
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,170
There needs to be a space between
'Rudolph' and 'Reindeer.'

1158
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,300
Lady Kim, there needs to be a space.

1159
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:20,630
- I think she's going to get it.
- You left the period in there.

1160
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,770
- You left the period.
- Hang on.

1161
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,040
Why are there so many things?

1162
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,620
You have to include the
smiley eyes in there.

1163
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,380
Just be quiet!

1164
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:36,280
Just be quiet!

1165
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,970
- There she goes.
- She's very good at it.

1166
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:48,300
[Round one is over in failure.]

1167
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,320
Wow, 30 seconds goes by quick.

1168
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,590
- She said she was good at it.
- I did do a good job.

1169
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,690
I'd rather be under those bells.
I feel so awful about this.

1170
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,760
It's okay, we're already covered in flour.

1171
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,660
- Okay, I'll just do as I please.
- We don't mind being dumped on again.

1172
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,080
We just need to succeed because
we need to draw for that money.

1173
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,070
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1174
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:16,770
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1175
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,180
Maybe this is so that we can
experience a white Christmas.

1176
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,080
[A special Christmas with the fall
of white flour snow.]

1177
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,740
- It's okay.
- We're fine.

1178
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,570
[Thank you for making me feel better.]

1179
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,920
- We won't say anything anymore.
- Please take your time.

1180
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:34,180
We're already covered in flour,
so don't worry about it.

1181
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,400
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

1182
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:42,220
- No need to be that relaxed about it though.
- Maybe stay a little bit nervous.

1183
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,920
- Please don't forget the spacing.
- Don't feel pressured.

1184
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,070
Maybe it'll be easier to do all that
after I finish writing it out first.

1185
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,790
- Yes, you can do that afterward.
- No, that's even harder.

1186
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,400
- That'll just make it harder.
- Just go in the order.

1187
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,510
- Just do as you'd like.
- Okay.

1188
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:59,260
- Do as you please.
- Here's your second text.

1189
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,020
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1190
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,940
- We're just getting started.
- Here's your text message.

1191
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,090
[Round two.]

1192
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,670
- I think this one is easier.
- Fighting!

1193
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,070
[This may be easier!]

1194
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:12,920
This one is easy.

1195
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,850
[The perfect way to spend Christmas.]

1196
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:20,520
- She's doing very well.
- We're going to get this one.

1197
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,210
- She's got it!
- There's a space!

1198
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:27,200
[Perfect use of spacing.]

1199
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,740
She's got it.

1200
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,800
- The space...
- Okay, but I need more time.

1201
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,320
- The perfect way!
- You're almost there!

1202
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,770
- There you go!
- Space and 'Way!'

1203
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:44,280
[Now... all she has to write is, 'Way.']

1204
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:49,970
[Please...]

1205
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,500
I got it.

1206
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,820
[Text message complete.]

1207
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,520
[Final mission, 'This is the sentence'-
Successfully completed!]

1208
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,110
[She did it!]

1209
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,640
[Kim Hye Ja doesn't fail twice!]

1210
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,010
You did such a great job.

1211
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,210
[Mission success!
Yes, this is it.]

1212
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,060
You did such a great job.

1213
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,790
- Thank you, and I'm so sorry.
- No, not at all.

1214
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,690
[Lady Kim, high-five!]

1215
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,480
[Big-nose cuts in.]

1216
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,510
[Left hanging.]

1217
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:33,510
- Sorry.
- No, not at all.

1218
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,680
You did such a great job.

1219
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,400
[Kiddo Ha Ha wants to be
embraced by mommy Hye Ja.]

1220
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,610
Can you come back on the
show every week?

1221
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:45,330
Okay, then make me a
permanent member.

1222
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:50,030
- Yes, wouldn't that be great?
- Congratulations on passing the mission.

1223
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:52,040
[Succeeded the final mission
thanks to Big Sister Kim.]

1224
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,700
There's a good chance that
we'll get a nine.

1225
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,400
[Balls numbered from one and nine,
and everyone chants for a nine.]

1226
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,920
We're all going to start screaming
if we do get a nine.

1227
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,760
[Best case scenario would be
to get a nine.]

1228
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,380
No thanks to Ji Suk Jin,
we only have 180,000 Won right now.

1229
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:12,390
But I really want all of us
to come out winners.

1230
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:16,710
Since there's a zero in there,
if you get it, you only get 180,000 Won.

1231
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,580
Ready, it's the last ball!

1232
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,040
[The final drawing which
Big Sister Kim will gets to draw.]

1233
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:27,000
[Please... let it be a nine.]

1234
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,960
- Anything above a five.
- Don't let it pressure you.

1235
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,300
[Let's draw the ball!]

1236
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:40,960
[Which numbered ball will it be?]

1237
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,510
[Please let it be a nine!]

1238
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,970
- Did you get the ball?
- Is it out yet?

1239
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,840
- Why?
- What is it?

1240
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,230
[Did you see the number?]

1241
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,870
What is it?
What's the number?

1242
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:03,330
- What's the number?
- What is it?

1243
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,400
[Could that smile...
mean that it's a zero?]

1244
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,700
- Okay... what if it's a nine?
- Is it a zero?

1245
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,570
[Could it be a nine?]

1246
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,390
- What is it?
- What is that smile for?

1247
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:20,230
[What is the number?]

1248
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,710
Six!

1249
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:28,830
[The final number is a six!]

1250
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:34,470
- That's 6.18 million Won.
- 6.18 million Won!

1251
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:39,190
[Santa's lottery drawing-
Wins 6.18 million Won!]

1252
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:45,200
- Wow, that's a lot of money.
- Are you really giving that money to us?

1253
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,390
[Here's the cash.]

1254
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,990
Really?

1255
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,690
- Wow.
- This is for real.

1256
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,420
- Should we take a look?
- Why don't you open one up?

1257
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,990
- Wow, it's real.
- It's real money.

1258
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:01,610
- Oh my, it's real.
- It's real money.

1259
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:07,900
- Oh my, thank you.
- 6.18 million Won!

1260
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,520
[A truly shocking Christmas gift.]

1261
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:16,270
In the name of Lady Kim Hye Ja
and our other guests

1262
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,020
we will donate this money
to children in need!

1263
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,080
[All of 6.18 million Won will be
donated to children in need.]

1264
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,400
I hope you'll join us for a name tag
elimination game if you ever come back.

1265
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,180
- I really had a wonderful time.
- Really?

1266
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:34,560
I met such a wonderful group of people,
and I was so happy to be here.

1267
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,100
It was a joyous and wonderful time,
and thank you so much for having me.

1268
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,840
- Thank you, it was our honor.
- It truly was our honor.

1269
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,400
Can you please say something for us?
Something that we've all wanted to hear.

1270
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,760
- The saying, 'Yes, that's it.'
- Ah, that saying?

1271
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,900
- As she rips off a name tag?
- Why don't you rip mine off as you say it?

1272
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,350
[While ripping off Mr. Capable's name tag.]

1273
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,230
- Okay.
- I can't believe this is happening!

1274
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:03,450
- I feel nervous.
- But my mom's cooking isn't it.

1275
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,190
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1276
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,060
Yes, that's it.

1277
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,650
['Yes, that's it.']

1278
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,800
[Thank you to Kim Hye Ja, Lee Chun Hee, and
Kang Hye Jung for making Christmas brighter.]

1279
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,230
[RM members and our guests donated
all the prize money to World Vision Center.]

1280
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,950
[Merry Christmas to all our viewers.]
