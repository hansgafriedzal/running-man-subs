00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Running Man
Episode 231

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:09,923
[There are no guests today.
Thus, marks the start of the mission.]

3
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:14,345
[The seemingly impossible mission
of the day...]

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,707
[And that day's mission becomes history.]

5
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:23,017
[The birth of Yoo-ames Bond.]

6
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:27,934
[Eliminates every member
with one single water gun.]

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,638
[The first Yoo-ames Bond mission
that became history in the making.]

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,443
[And after a whole year...]

9
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,700
[Yoo-ames Bond makes his return.]

10
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:52,974
[The mission becomes even more difficult.]

11
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,904
[But... Yoo-ames Bond evolves.]

12
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:06,547
[With his improves skills, he
successfully eliminates all the members.]

13
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:11,135
[Not just once... but twice.]

14
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:15,293
[The members' shock and rage.]

15
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:22,415
[The second Yoo-ames Bond mission
shows off his elite spy status.]

16
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,951
[His impressive resume
gets filed into the past...]

17
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:31,865
[And today...]

18
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:35,284
[Yoo-ames Bond returns
in his perfected form.]

19
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,481
[Yoo-ames Bond returns better than ever.]

20
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:45,282
[And... something completely unexpected.]

21
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:51,973
[Today will go down in history.]

22
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,389
[January 6, 2015 - 1 PM.
Taekwondo Stadium in Mooju.]

23
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:04,225
What is this?

24
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:07,114
Why are you doing this to me?
I just got here!

25
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,528
[Blindfolded the moment he walks in.]

26
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,782
Seriously.

27
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:13,535
What are you blindfolding me for?

28
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:16,084
Something must be happening today.

29
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,912
[Feeling nervous.]

30
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:26,419
[Where is he being taken to?]

31
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:35,093
[After walking for a bit...
his blindfold finally comes off.]

32
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:36,246
Here?

33
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,134
What is this?

34
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,724
What is this all about?

35
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,130
[Wait, this is...]

36
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:50,182
Is this the day?

37
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:57,526
[Now that we think back,
this is how it's always been.]

38
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:07,965
[Being summoned to a secret room
to receive a secret mission.]

39
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,401
[Next, the assigning of the weapon.]

40
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:21,010
[And the second secret room
becomes even more upgraded.]

41
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,725
[Thus, Yoo-ames Bond's missions
always began from a secret room.]

42
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,517
- Mr. Yoo-ames Bond.
- Yes?

43
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:38,848
- You've always performed well for us.
- Yes, that's true.

44
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:43,029
- We've designated a successor for you.
- What do you mean, my successor?

45
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,043
- We've designated a successor for you.
- What do you mean, my successor?

46
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:49,827
[A successor?]

47
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:53,084
- Your successor will soon be joining us.
- So?

48
00:03:53,382 --> 00:04:03,149
Hand your water gun over to your successor,
and order that person to eliminate everyone.

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,529
[Hand over my water gun?]

50
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,437
- Who said I want a successor?
- And as for you...

51
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,267
You have to teach your successor
all of your spy skills

52
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,423
and help that person successfully
become the second Bond.

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,765
[The second Bond?]

54
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,565
You know how quick witted Blank Ji is?

55
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:31,885
She asked me earlier this morning
if it's going to be a spy mission today.

56
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:37,068
You have no idea how tight the
competition is amongst those guys.

57
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:42,550
Having me be the spy is one thing,
but having someone else become the spy?

58
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,350
[I'm not going to be the spy, but
there will be a successor in my place?]

59
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,353
[A successor...]

60
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:51,613
Who's going to be my successor?
I can only think of one person.

61
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:55,607
To be honest, even though he's older
than me, he's actually my junior.

62
00:04:55,608 --> 00:05:01,612
Suk Jin... He's actually two years
my junior in this business.

63
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:04,469
[Possible successor one - Suk Jin.
Older in age, but a junior in experience.]

64
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,857
[No one can beat Big-nose
when it comes to enthusiasm.]

65
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,450
Ji Hyo.

66
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,082
[Possible successor two - Ji Hyo.]

67
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,154
[The undisputed Ace of Running Man-
A true hunter in form.]

68
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,434
It can't be Jong Kook. He thought
he was Rambo with the water gun.

69
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,699
[This man is more like a mercenary
rather than an agent.]

70
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,932
Kwang Soo.

71
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,891
[Possible successor four- Kwang Soo.]

72
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:26,121
[Traitor instincts down to the bone-
The icon of betrayal.]

73
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,217
As for Ha Ha and Gary...

74
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,454
[Possible successor five - Ha Ha.]

75
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,300
[Haroro, always has a trick up his sleeves.]

76
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,695
[Possible successor six - Gary.]

77
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:37,406
[One of the strongest members-
Mr. Random Capable.]

78
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,331
- I don't know who's coming, either.
- Really?

79
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,860
[Who could it be?]

80
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:46,070
[Unable to even fathom a guess
as to who the successor is going to be.]

81
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:50,388
If you find yourself in danger, or
feel that your successor isn't performing

82
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:52,606
then you have the authority to
eliminate that person.

83
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:02,817
Your successor will soon be here, and
we ask that you be kind to that person.

84
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:06,420
Ugh, I wonder who's going to show up.

85
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:09,394
[Just who will show up as his successor
to become the second Bond?]

86
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,601
[Big-nose]

87
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,955
[Kkuk]

88
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,374
[Kwang Soo]

89
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,639
[Ha Ha]

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,934
[Ji Hyo]

91
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,750
[Gary]

92
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,725
[It doesn't matter who it is...]

93
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:25,322
[I will be the one to determine
who becomes my successor.]

94
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,836
[Yoo-ames Bond]

95
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,193
[Song Ji Hyo]

96
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,022
[Kim Jong Kook]

97
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:40,033
[Gary]

98
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,789
[Ha Ha]

99
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,822
[Ji Suk Jin and Lee Kwang Soo]

100
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,814
[And Yoo Jae Suk]

101
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:54,596
[Yoo-ames Bond - The Successor]

102
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:58,178
[The same morning at 8 am.]

103
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:01,189
[Taekwondo Stadium in Mooju.]

104
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,797
[The room they're secretly entering
with an alarm clock in hand is...]

105
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,620
[none other than Running Man
members' rooms.]

106
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:19,790
[The ultimate morning call service.]

107
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,171
[What is this?]

108
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,940
[What noise is this so early
in the morning?]

109
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:43,110
[Mommy, five more minutes...]

110
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:47,761
[Oh, you're not my mommy.]

111
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:51,215
How do I turn this off?

112
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:58,568
You're stopping it with your hand
instead of turning off the alarm?

113
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,089
[Kkuk wakes up by choking
the mechanism off the clock.]

114
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:06,064
Ugh, you startled me awake
from my sleep.

115
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:08,753
[Still half asleep.]

116
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:14,295
[Barely manage to pull themselves awake.]

117
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:21,690
[Handed their mission for the day
as soon as they open their eyes.]

118
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:28,214
'Please find me' race?

119
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:32,228
You have currently lost your identities.

120
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:38,180
You have currently lost your identities.

121
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:43,103
As your name tag states,
you are not yourself at this moment.

122
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,219
- You're not Song Ji Hyo.
- You're not Ji Suk Jin.

123
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,723
My back is blank right now?

124
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,999
What is this?

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,006
[Their name tags are blank.]

126
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,918
[Checking to see their blank name tags.]

127
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,065
Am I just a spirit?

128
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:10,450
[Getting used to the idea of
having become a spirit.]

129
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,730
[Big-nose's face is quite
swollen from his sleep.]

130
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:19,681
Ugh, I slept without my shirt on,
and now I feel all congested.

131
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,569
My face is really
swollen right now, isn't it?

132
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,406
[Checking himself out in the camera.]

133
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:32,488
I really have lost myself.
I'm not myself right now.

134
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:40,074
If you want to get your identity back,
then hurry over to the taekwondo studio.

135
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,999
[Please Find Me Race- Start]

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,740
[Please Find Me Race- Start]

137
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,541
[On their way to the taekwondo studio.]

138
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,777
What is this?
This is so tacky.

139
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,691
- Is it a competition of some sorts?
- Are we the White Team?

140
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:57,342
- You're spirits.
- We're spirits?

141
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,300
Because we've lost our identities?

142
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:02,086
- All our name tags are blank.
- Let me see.

143
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:05,618
[The members have lost their identities,
and all that remains are their spirits.]

144
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:10,504
Do you remember the movie, 'Please find me'?
There's a twist at the end.

145
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:16,180
- Yes, you're right.
- I'm wondering if this is a spy race.

146
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,686
- You're on that already?
- Are you getting started already?

147
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:22,455
[Current time- 8:30 am.
Long before Jae Suk received his mission.]

148
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,377
You're talking about spies already?

149
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:28,939
- We're spirits today...
- I've always been tricked by spies.

150
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,422
- That's why I need to be alert.
- Gary's not saying anything.

151
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,117
You know how I am.

152
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:37,782
- I can't figure Gary out anymore.
- No, I don't know how to read Gary anymore.

153
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,455
- Kwang Soo won't be the spy.
- Why not?

154
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,697
You make it too obvious.

155
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:45,578
What nonsense to talk about
so early in the morning.

156
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,335
There's no need to talk such nonsense.

157
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,124
[Entering the taekwondo studio...]

158
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,642
Have any one of you seen my body?

159
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,564
My physical being has disappeared.

160
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,635
- You're blindfolding us?
- What are you guys doing?

161
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:07,362
What are you blindfolding me for?

162
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:12,266
[All the members are led off to
different locations while blindfolded.]

163
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:23,529
[They all arrive at their respective spots
and take off their blindfolds.]

164
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:28,059
Ugh, you startled me.
Who are you?

165
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,717
[Who are you?]

166
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,790
[They take off their blindfolds to find
mysterious doctors in front of them.]

167
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,731
Hello.

168
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:44,243
Your physical body is hidden
somewhere within this building.

169
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:47,703
The moment you stepped into this building,
your physical being has started to disappear.

170
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,829
Quickly complete your mission,
and recover your body.

171
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:56,646
[They must complete their mission and
recover their bodies before they disappear.]

172
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,600
I have to find and recover my body
before it disappears completely?

173
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,008
- Okay, I understand.
- You have to find your body.

174
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:06,598
There are many locked rooms
inside this building.

175
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,969
You have to search through those rooms
and find the one that's housing your body.

176
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,434
[Find the room that's housing their body
amongst the numerous rooms.]

177
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,101
I understand.

178
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,426
- Can I get going now?
- Wait.

179
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,097
[Pocket of life.]

180
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:26,297
There are five jewels in here?

181
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:31,365
[Five Jewels of Life and a yellow key.]

182
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:36,368
[The key will open only a few of the
numerous locked rooms in the building.]

183
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:41,825
[Inside those rooms are a variety
of different missions that await them.]

184
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:45,496
Once you succeed a mission,
then you'll be given another key.

185
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:49,399
[Succeed the mission
to receive a key to the next level.]

186
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,424
[Then the key received will get you
to the next level's gateway.]

187
00:12:54,425 --> 00:13:02,211
[Must succeed a mission from each level until
the room that's housing their body is found.]

188
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,774
So I have to find the room
that can be opened with this key

189
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:08,832
and succeed the mission within that room
to move onto the next level?

190
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:12,979
I have to give up one of my jewels
every time I fail a mission?

191
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,441
You'll be given another jewel
when you succeed a mission

192
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,338
but you'll have to give one up
when you fail a mission.

193
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,373
If you lose all your jewels,
then your body will disappear completely.

194
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:23,993
Which means,
you'll be eliminated from the game.

195
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,199
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

196
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,878
[Off to start the missions.]

197
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,676
You must go and get started!
There's not much time.

198
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,302
Can you let me see your face?

199
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,576
[Excessively dramatic doctor.]

200
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,175
What's wrong with you?

201
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,911
You must live in order for
me to live, too!

202
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:54,079
[I must successfully complete my missions
in order to save the life of my doctor.]

203
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,682
He's really funny.

204
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:00,207
[Time to start the 'Please Find Me' race!]

205
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,615
Here's a yellow door.

206
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,834
[Discovers a yellow room that matches
the color of the key received.]

207
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:11,057
[What sort of a mission will
he find inside the yellow room?]

208
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:15,267
[Attempts to open the lock
with his yellow key.]

209
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,799
[It's not opening.]

210
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,685
Just because the door's yellow,
it doesn't mean that they all open?

211
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:27,475
[Only a few of the yellow rooms
can be opened with their yellow key.]

212
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:32,053
[First step in the mission is to find
the room that their own key will open.]

213
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:34,177
There are so many rooms!

214
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:39,962
[While the members are getting started
on their mysterious mission...]

215
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,058
[Just then...]

216
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,141
[Yoo-ames Bond is about to receive
his secret mission.]

217
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:52,790
Your successor will soon be here, and
we ask that you be kind to your successor.

218
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,311
[Yoo-ames Bond's mission- Eliminate the rest
of the members with his successor.]

219
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,549
[Waiting in hiding for his successor.]

220
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,758
[Who could it be... Who could it be?]

221
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,747
[Who could it be?]

222
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:18,395
[His successor enters the room.]

223
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:23,689
[Just who could it be?]

224
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:31,609
[Lee Kwang Soo]

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,112
[A secret room?]

226
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:38,422
[Elated at the thought of possibly
being asked to be a spy.]

227
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:43,187
I really want to enjoy this moment.
This moment makes me feel so happy.

228
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,345
What is it?
What is this about?

229
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:53,857
[The wall is opening!]

230
00:15:55,132 --> 00:16:00,744
[Making his appearance from behind
the wall, is Yoo-ames Bond.]

231
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:06,745
[Oh my goodness! I can't believe
I'm witnessing this moment!]

232
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,982
You can't come into the secret room!

233
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,565
[I was here way before you came in.]

234
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,115
- I'm Yoo-ames Bond.
- Yes, I forgot.

235
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,796
- Can't you tell by looking at this?
- What's going on here today?

236
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,087
[Can't be...]

237
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:23,143
[Yes, today is the day.]

238
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:26,300
- Have a seat.
- Aren't I the star of this episode?

239
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:30,143
- Am I not the one?
- You're nothing until I decide to take you.

240
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,601
You're just...

241
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,378
a tall guy...
with the face of a dog.

242
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,239
Have a seat.

243
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,786
[Yoo-ames Bond sits down to relay
the rules to his possible successor.]

244
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,546
Today...

245
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,904
will go down in history.

246
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,887
Do you know how many Yoo-ames Bond
episodes today makes?

247
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,189
- This is the third episode.
- Yes, it is.

248
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,699
It's the most successful theme
in the history of Running Man.

249
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,423
No, it's not to that extent.
Who says that it is?

250
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:01,335
Every single viewer out there
awaits my Bond episodes.

251
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,891
This is that day.
But...

252
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:08,301
You and I will become a team today.

253
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,659
Today...

254
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:15,177
- I won't be the one to shoot this water gun.
- Me?

255
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:20,035
- You'll be the one to shoot it.
- But why are you talking to me like that?

256
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,959
- Get out.
- No, come on.

257
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,223
[How dare you!]

258
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:27,627
- If you don't want to hear it, then get out.
- I was just asking.

259
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,743
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Okay.

260
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:31,586
[Calms down to carry on
with the mission message.]

261
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,618
The reason why I called you in here
is because...

262
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:37,526
if you successfully complete your mission...

263
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:42,950
then as of today,
you will officially become an agent.

264
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:46,350
Your final test before you
become an agent

265
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:53,559
will be revealed to you once all the other
members have been ousted by the water gun.

266
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:58,557
Only when you and I are the only ones left,
will you be given your final test.

267
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:00,569
- A test?
- That's right.

268
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:04,173
I have to pass the test
before I officially become an agent?

269
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:08,095
You have to eliminate everyone else first.
You're looking at me like that again.

270
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:11,268
You're looking at me
like you don't trust me.

271
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,965
I can see your traitorous instinct
starting to rear its ugly head.

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,599
- Are you really going to be like this?
- No, I'm not.

273
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,264
Can I shoot you, too?
Not that I want to do that.

274
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:24,085
- I'm just asking out of curiosity.
- That's why I'm telling you the rules.

275
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,311
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

276
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:31,813
You can shoot this water gun
only when we're both together.

277
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,831
Do you understand what I'm saying?

278
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:37,530
Which means, this.
During today's Yoo-ames Bond episode

279
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,589
I will act as your mentor.

280
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:45,377
Think about how many times you've ruined
big secret missions like this in the past.

281
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,105
I've never ruined anything.

282
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:50,535
As the viewers are watching
with such high expectations

283
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:53,689
there have been numerous occasions
where you've totally ruined the outcome.

284
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,318
- I know that things didn't go well...
- That's what I'm saying.

285
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,755
[Fascinatingly enough, the bigger the secret,
more obvious Kwang Soo made everything look.]

286
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:03,662
That's why I'm going to take care to pass on
all my knowledge over to you during this.

287
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:06,791
- Is this like Batman and Robin?
- No, it's not.

288
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,544
We're Don Quixote and Sancho.

289
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,827
Young-Gu and Daeng-Chil.

290
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:16,185
There you go, now you're getting it.

291
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,824
Only when the two of are together,
will this water gun have any effect.

292
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,811
- Do you understand?
- Only when we're together?

293
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:27,565
[While the two are formulating
their plans together...]

294
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:33,072
[The other five members are busy
trying to find the right rooms.]

295
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,400
My key is going to get worn out.

296
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,929
Like my heart?

297
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,463
[Kang Gary, the man of persistence.]

298
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,909
I can't believe that
none of these doors are opening.

299
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,262
There's even a black room.

300
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:54,612
A black room?

301
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:58,997
I wonder if there's going to be
some monsters again today?

302
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:04,213
That one's black, and this one is red.

303
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:09,077
Yellow...

304
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:11,644
Aren't those taekwondo belt colors?

305
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,000
Those are the different level colors.

306
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:17,868
These are the different levels.

307
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,176
It is, isn't it, Yoo Suk?
Red belt, black belt...

308
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,388
They're belts!
Taekwondo belts.

309
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:28,434
Yellow, and the blue over there.

310
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,550
[While the members are slowly
getting one step closer to the truth...]

311
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,631
[These two are still only
talking about their mission.]

312
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:37,459
You need to pull yourself together.
We have to get our acts together, got it?

313
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,993
Okay, then...

314
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,837
[Yoo-ames Bond's symbolic water guns.]

315
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,553
[Unable to believe his sight.]

316
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:02,699
[The water guns that
he's only seen from afar.]

317
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,437
Did they really have to
hang that picture up there?

318
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,728
- Why is it only about Jae Suk?
- This is my special episode.

319
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:11,342
- I can understand the water guns...
- This is my special episode.

320
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:18,166
If you succeed your mission today,
then I'll sign this picture for you.

321
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,169
- No, it's okay.
- You can hang it up in your room.

322
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,149
- No, it's okay.
- I'm telling you to hang it up in your room.

323
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,967
- Choose one.
- I don't know which one to choose.

324
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:28,491
[First water gun selection
of Kwang Soo's life.]

325
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:30,812
- Should I go with the big one?
- No.

326
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:34,445
Then pick one for me if you're going to
disapprove of my selection.

327
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:39,176
- Then choose one for me.
- The elephant and the alligator are popular.

328
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,562
- You have to be very careful with it.
- Should I keep it in my pants?

329
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:45,599
- There are different colored solutions.
- This is...

330
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:51,172
The color disappears after a minute,
and doesn't leave a trace.

331
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,625
Your current situation from
when I first started out

332
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:57,266
is extremely different.
You're really getting spoiled.

333
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:01,491
Are you aware of that? The world
has become so much more convenient.

334
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:03,767
What if you spill?

335
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:07,369
I feel like I'm in a movie or something.

336
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,600
No, what are you doing?

337
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,238
- What if it leaves a trace?
- Don't be such an amateur.

338
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,955
Do you not believe in today's technology?

339
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,154
[It really did disappear!]

340
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,317
- What do you think?
- It disappears right away.

341
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:32,837
If you really get to the final stage
as we discussed earlier

342
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,599
then you will be honored
with a new name.

343
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,487
What will my name be?

344
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,649
- There's a very famous investigator.
- Who?

345
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,480
Mr. Choi Bul Ham.

346
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:46,905
Since I'm Yoo-ames Bond,
how about 'Kwang-Buram' for you?

347
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:50,686
[Not getting a very good feeling about this.]

348
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:57,295
He has solved countless crimes,
and are you disrespecting his role?

349
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:59,110
No, I'm very honored by the name,
and I respect him greatly...

350
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,275
You think only foreign names
are cool and good?

351
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:05,888
- Your name will become your identity.
- I will succeed and become Kwang-Buram.

352
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:08,350
You will be Kwang-Buram.

353
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:10,505
There's this, too.

354
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:13,263
[Yoo-ames Bond's other symbol-
The gold bracelet.]

355
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:18,683
[If others discover the gold bracelet,
then they fail the mission.]

356
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:24,566
[Bond himself puts the band on Kwang Soo
so that it's not caught by others.]

357
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,682
What if only one of us gets caught?

358
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:29,669
Then can I eliminate the other members
by myself without Jae Suk?

359
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,015
- What are the rules on that?
- What is it that you're trying to do?

360
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:35,133
What are you saying? Are you
saying that you'll do it on your own?

361
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:38,454
[Kwang Soo's still unable to move on from
the dream of being the sole star of the show.]

362
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,436
Okay, let's go.

363
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:42,848
[Time to start their secret mission.]

364
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,944
- Kwang-Buram.
- Yoo-ames Bond.

365
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:48,788
- Good luck on the mission.
- Thank you.

366
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,136
[Will Yoo-ames Bond be able to
pass down his legacy?]

367
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,717
[Yoo-ames Bond and Kwang-Buram's
start of the mission.]

368
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,485
<i>Jae Suk, you have your
water gun, right?</i>

369
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:04,520
<i>- It's not showing, is it?
- No, it's not.</i>

370
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,814
[Kwang-Buram is following
in Yoo-ames Bond's trail.]

371
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:10,657
- My clothes are soaked.
- Why?

372
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,393
- I think my water gun is leaking.
- Let me see.

373
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:18,276
No, it's okay.
It's rubbing alcohol, so it doesn't matter.

374
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,127
[Yoo-ames Bond, at his best.
Always being cautious.]

375
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,352
There's more up there.

376
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,590
[The other members are still
searching for their rooms.]

377
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,632
[Will this door open?]

378
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,611
This one fits!

379
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,634
This one actually fits!

380
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:37,415
[Finally enters the first mission room.]

381
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,088
[Each room holds a different mission.
Which mission waits in this room?]

382
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:46,501
[30 seconds on the clock with five chances-
Catch five balls or more with tongs to win.]

383
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:51,937
Successfully complete the mission to
win the key to the next level door.

384
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:55,464
[Rule- Must bet one Jewel of Life
for each mission.]

385
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:58,761
I have to catch five of these balls
with these tongs?

386
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,827
I can't use the paddle at all?

387
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,017
Okay, I'll do it.

388
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:07,911
[Will receive the Jewel of Life,
and clear for the blue level if he wins.]

389
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:10,707
[But if he fails the mission,
then he loses a Jewel of Life.]

390
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:15,321
[Discovers his prey, Ha Ha.]

391
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,448
Jae Suk, I have to catch
the balls with these tongs.

392
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,282
- That's pretty much impossible.
- Okay.

393
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:24,600
Let's do this!

394
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,214
[Yellow Zone- Catch the table tennis balls.]

395
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,232
You should've caught that one.
How could you not have caught it?

396
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,229
[Now that he's actually doing it,
it's not as easy as it looks.]

397
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,419
[Catches one of five.]

398
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:37,493
[But the balls keeps bouncing
off of his tongs.]

399
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,650
[Rage filled full swing.]

400
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:44,136
That's too bad.
That would make me angry, too.

401
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:49,045
Ugh, I'd get angry, too.
I'm getting aggravated just from watching.

402
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:52,484
[Yoo-ames Bond continues to
further agitate Ha Ha.]

403
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,677
[Only one ball successfully caught so far.]

404
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,060
[Fails the first attempt.]

405
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:02,949
Ugh, I'm so aggravated.

406
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:08,043
[Wait...]

407
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:13,029
[This is when I'd normally
be targeting his back...]

408
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,809
<i>Only when the two of us are together
can you shoot your water gun.</i>

409
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,090
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

410
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:23,412
[But he can only pretend to be doing
the mission since Kwang Soo's not with him.]

411
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,661
Since I'm already here,
can I try this mission, too?

412
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:29,506
- Only once Ha Ha's finished.
- Then I can do it?

413
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:31,991
Yes, but you have to bet
one of your jewels.

414
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:35,143
- Huh?
- Why are you acting like you don't know?

415
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:37,924
- Because I've already lost one.
- Really?

416
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,271
- You have to bet a jewel, okay?
- Okay, go!

417
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:43,052
[Yellow Zone Mission- Second Attempt.]

418
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:48,540
[This time, Ha Ha grabs the tongs
in a different direction.]

419
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,988
[Mission accomplished.]

420
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,920
[He's already succeeded the mission,
but he continues to go for the record.]

421
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,880
[The tongs are now
an extension of his hands.]

422
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,299
[Isn't catching the balls
with the tongs so easy?]

423
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,761
- What the heck? 17...
- I did it!

424
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,405
[Ha Ha successfully clears the mission.]

425
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:15,384
- He just saw how I did it.
- Challenge accepted.

426
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,089
Challenge.

427
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,396
[Ha Ha's Jewel of Life
is returned back to him.]

428
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:26,286
I get my jewel back,
and I also get a blue key!

429
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:28,648
- Okay, buddy.
- Okay!

430
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,383
- I'll watch you play before I go.
- Okay.

431
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:33,541
Okay, let's go.

432
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,954
Which way is it coming?

433
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:41,039
[His skills are so...]

434
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:45,863
Ugh, this is aggravating.
Oh, I got one!

435
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:50,271
[The balls continues to bounce
off of his tongs.]

436
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,801
[Is he purposely not catching the balls?]

437
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:58,071
Jae Suk, you have to stop letting it
bounce off the tongs.

438
00:27:58,072 --> 00:28:00,934
[Ha Ha doesn't suspect Jae Suk of being
a spy, and gives him advice.]

439
00:28:00,935 --> 00:28:02,800
- That's right.
- Like this?

440
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,883
- There you go.
- Ugh!

441
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,903
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm going to get going.

442
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,193
[Unlike the confidence he started with,
fails the mission.]

443
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:13,973
[Pretends to be enraged.]

444
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:16,968
[Imitates Yoo-ames Bond's movements.]

445
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:20,430
- I didn't do that. It was my first attempt.
- Goodbye!

446
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:22,499
Ugh, this is so aggravating.

447
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:26,494
[Ha Ha leaves in search for
the blue level mission.]

448
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:27,820
Ugh, this is so aggravating.

449
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:33,095
I'm all set.
You can stop doing that now.

450
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:39,495
[No need to pretend anymore
since there aren't any eyes watching.]

451
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,247
You can calm down.

452
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:48,647
Since some have moved on to the next level,
shall we start eliminating them one by one?

453
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:54,839
I think I'm going to go and check
to see what my pupil is up to.

454
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,104
Then we will start the elimination process.

455
00:28:57,105 --> 00:29:00,194
[Starts hunting mode with Kwang-Buram.]

456
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,941
[Kwang-Buram, on the other hand...]

457
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,544
What are you doing?

458
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:08,126
[Just like Yoo-ames Bond predicted,
he's mingling with the other members.]

459
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:11,310
- Are you able to go to the red rooms?
- Only one person at a time can find it.

460
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,038
Only one person at a time
can find their bodies.

461
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,841
[Slowly starting to feel the pressure
with the members' succeeding their missions.]

462
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:18,839
[They must be eliminated,
but where's Yoo-ames Bond?]

463
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,804
[Yoo-ames Bond exits
the yellow mission room...]

464
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:24,145
- I succeeded the mission.
- Nice.

465
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:27,188
[Yoo-ames Bond pretends to have
succeeded the mission to avoid suspicion.]

466
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,698
- Jae Suk, did you succeed?
- Yes, I did.

467
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:32,136
- You have four left? You should get going.
- I have four missions left.

468
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,006
I have to go to the bathroom first.

469
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:38,614
[Kwang-Buram follows in
Yoo-ames Bond's footsteps.]

470
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,513
You have to remain covert
and shoot without hesitation.

471
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:46,089
You can't hesitate at all.

472
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,800
- And you have to keep it covert.
- Okay, I'll do it quick.

473
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,579
Check and make sure
that your water gun is full.

474
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,598
It doesn't need to be completely full,
but make sure that it can shoot.

475
00:29:56,958 --> 00:30:00,878
You have to make sure
to get it with the first shoot.

476
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,441
- Don't be nervous.
- Okay.

477
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,024
Just trust me.

478
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:09,925
Pull yourself together.
I said, pull yourself together.

479
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:13,845
The moment you lose your focus,
then you and I are over, got it?

480
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,254
[The two spies' secret meeting
in the bathroom.]

481
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,436
- Don't let me see you having doubts again.
- Okay.

482
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:19,580
The moment I see you having
doubts again...

483
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:21,707
I'll just end you myself.

484
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:25,058
- Pull yourself together.
- I'll shoot at your signal.

485
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,040
I'll be right out, okay?

486
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,571
[Yoo-ames Bond leaves after leaving
behind some of his wisdom.]

487
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:40,625
[The nerves are making his stomach...
He takes after Jae Suk in this matter, too?]

488
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,179
- Please!
- It's not going to work.

489
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:51,952
I got it to open.
Bye!

490
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:55,025
[Gary finally succeeds in entering
the Yellow Mission Zone.]

491
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,853
Bye, Ji Hyo!

492
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:05,478
Find 15 things that are different between
the two rooms and explain what they are.

493
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:10,256
- 15 of them?
- Yes, 15 differences between the rooms.

494
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:13,830
[30 seconds and five chances to find
15 differences between the rooms.]

495
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,168
Ready, set, go!

496
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:25,028
[We invite all the viewers to
join us in the mission.]

497
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:30,036
[Spot the difference between the rooms.]

498
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:33,712
[Mr. Gary scans the two rooms.]

499
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:38,204
Cup, books, shoes, umbrella....

500
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,387
[Time over- Time to state his answers.]

501
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:44,817
- The cup is different.
- How are they different?

502
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,129
- You have to be more detailed.
- One is short, and one is tall.

503
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,995
[The size of the cups.]

504
00:31:48,996 --> 00:31:51,483
And the book in the middle is different.

505
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:54,257
They're different colors.
One is green.

506
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:58,961
The clothes are different, too.
This stack is missing one.

507
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:03,275
The slippers.
The socks are different prints.

508
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:06,570
The umbrella colors are different.

509
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:11,394
The hanger is different,
and the time on the clock is different.

510
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,268
[Different times.]

511
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,807
And... and that's all I
have for now.

512
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,836
[12 differences are spotted so far,
and only three more left to find.]

513
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,936
The round peg on the clothes rack
are different colors.

514
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:25,052
[The color of the nail on the coat rack.]

515
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:26,963
Wait a minute...

516
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:30,165
[Only two more differences are left to find.]

517
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,841
Only two are left, right?

518
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:40,102
Okay, it's all over!

519
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:45,209
First, it's the doll.
One is missing a shoe.

520
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,199
[The shoe on the doll.]

521
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,525
And the baseball bat.

522
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:53,735
One has a black tape wrapped around it,
and the other one doesn't.

523
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:55,473
[All 15 differences are spotted.]

524
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,556
[Gary clears the mission.]

525
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:02,263
[His Jewel of Life is returned back to him.]

526
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:03,378
I want to go and find my being again.

527
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:07,333
[He earns the key to the blue level.]

528
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:09,685
Okay, it's off to the blue level now.

529
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,653
[Two of the members are now
off to the blue level.]

530
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,710
Okay, let's go.

531
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:21,321
Things are going pretty well.
Shall I go for the win today?

532
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:25,676
[Gary is now on the search
for the opening blue door.]

533
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,800
I hope one opens right away.

534
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:30,220
Come on, let's find an opening door.

535
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,473
[I'm going to find my missing body.]

536
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,551
[Find the mate- Find the matching
fruity scented hand cream.]

537
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:44,179
[A total of seven chances,
and onto his sixth attempt.]

538
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,448
[Successfully finds the banana pair.]

539
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,589
[Fails the sixth attempt.]

540
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:56,813
I thought that I had that one.

541
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,510
[Final seventh attempt.]

542
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:05,007
Ugh, I'm ruined.
I'm in big trouble now.

543
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,461
[Two pairs still left to match.]

544
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,759
I can open one at a time?

545
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,694
Okay, I'm good.

546
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:13,889
I've succeeded.

547
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,130
Okay, I've succeeded.

548
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:20,736
[Jong Kook succeeds his mission.]

549
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:23,083
I like this one.
Banana.

550
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:25,777
[At ease enough to put on some hand cream.
Mr. Capable is a man who looks after himself.]

551
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:30,896
This is the key that will allow you
to enter the blue zone.

552
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:32,765
Thank you.

553
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:37,431
[Yellow zone mission-
Find the key within five seconds.]

554
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:40,174
[Find the key from the bowl of hot stones.]

555
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,232
[Ouch, that's hot!]

556
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:49,035
[Finds the key right away!]

557
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:53,102
[Big-nose succeeds his mission.]

558
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,811
Today is my day.
Ouch, that's hot.

559
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:58,174
[The heat of the game lingers on.]

560
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:03,163
Okay, off to the next zone.
Okay, I've still got five lives left.

561
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:06,006
- You are now upgraded to the blue level.
- Okay.

562
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:08,723
I have a good feeling about today.

563
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,736
Listen to me carefully.
What we do from now on is what matters.

564
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:22,456
What you're doing right now

565
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:25,705
and the slight smile or expression
you have on your face

566
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:30,523
when you go around the other members is
what will get you suspected by others.

567
00:35:30,524 --> 00:35:32,257
- But I don't know how to hide it.
- I know.

568
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:35,165
The movement you start to deny it,
that's when they'll get suspicious of you.

569
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,229
But if I don't say anything, then
they get suspicious of me being quiet.

570
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,342
Forget everything that I just told you,
and everything we just talked about.

571
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:47,775
You're just here to find a key
like everyone else, and that's it.

572
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,526
- The key finding mission.
- That's right.

573
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:53,386
Just think about that mission,
and not about the water gun, okay?

574
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,468
[I'll make sure to remember.]

575
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,572
[Even though he told him
and told him again...]

576
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:03,923
[That's the look of reassurance
on his face?]

577
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:09,627
[It's as if he's announcing to the world,
'I'm on a secret mission!']

578
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,236
Kwang Soo!

579
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:15,330
Kwang Soo.

580
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,793
Where did Kwang Soo go?
Call him and see where he's at.

581
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:25,030
What is he doing?
What is he up to by himself?

582
00:36:25,031 --> 00:36:27,565
[Kwang Soo... you haven't been
caught already, have you?]

583
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,842
We have to find the room first, right?

584
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:35,975
[Must find a blue zone room
that the key fits into.]

585
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:39,627
[Mr. Gary is showing the most enthusiasm
for finding the room at the moment.]

586
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,667
I found it.

587
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:47,879
[Gary is first to enter the blue zone.]

588
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,509
[Just then, Yoo Hyuk is seen
heading towards Gary's direction.]

589
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:54,174
- Are you in the blue zone?
- Yes, the blue zone.

590
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,685
- Want to play a game with me?
- Where?

591
00:36:56,686 --> 00:36:59,238
- What's in here?
- I don't think Suk Jin can do it.

592
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:04,219
[Must endure being tickled longer than
your opponent with the recorder in mouth.]

593
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,577
- No, I can't do this.
- Why not?

594
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:09,722
You know that I can't stand
being tickled.

595
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:14,250
- You know I hate being tickled!
- Come on, why?

596
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,079
- I'm weak when it comes to being tickled.
- Let's just play a practice game.

597
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,324
[Playing a practice round to
determine whether to play it or not.]

598
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:21,897
[Jae Suk to take the first turn.]

599
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:25,493
- You have to spread out your arms.
- No, I don't need to do that.

600
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,682
[Gary just grazed Jae Suk's side...]

601
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:37,195
[Jae Suk is one very sensitive man.]

602
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,693
Why don't you give it a try?

603
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:44,233
- Gary's good at enduring things like this.
- I feel like I'm being tickled already.

604
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:48,239
- Wait, I'm not ready yet.
- But Gary's good at things like this, right?

605
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,103
[Already feeling the tickles even though
the game hasn't even started yet.]

606
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:52,162
Ready, set...

607
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,841
I'm not playing this mission.

608
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,807
- I'm not playing this game.
- You guys are neck and neck.

609
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:04,326
- You should do it.
- Okay, let's do it.

610
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:07,850
[The two weakest players are
deciding to take on the mission.]

611
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:11,538
- Okay, this may not be bad.
- Okay, let's do this.

612
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,552
[Putting one of their life jewels on the line
to play the mission.]

613
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:17,628
[Only the winner of the mission
will get their jewel back.]

614
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,914
- It's whoever can last longer?
- This is much more fun than watching TV.

615
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,298
I'd better take off my glasses.

616
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,478
Pay close attention to him, okay?

617
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,465
He really is so ugly.

618
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:36,114
[Even though I may be ugly,
I have to stop Gary from succeeding.]

619
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:45,864
[The recorder blows loud and clear,
as soon as the mission starts.]

620
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,876
[A guaranteed win.]

621
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,380
- How long was it?
- I'm guessing it was 0.13 seconds?

622
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,907
- How long was it?
- It was 0.18 seconds.

623
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:57,767
0.18... then I need to
end Gary by 0.17 seconds.

624
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,607
This is kind of hard.

625
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:03,642
I have to get going myself,
but I'm too entertained by this.

626
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,426
[Now, it's Gary's turn.]

627
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:12,118
It's not even a second.
You just have to last 0.18 seconds.

628
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,928
Okay, that 0.18 seconds is a very
important time in my life.

629
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,112
I just need to long enough
for that important time.

630
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:22,588
Okay, everything is hanging
on this moment.

631
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,865
[Already feeling the tickle even
though it hasn't even started yet.]

632
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,011
What are your hands doing
there already?

633
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,671
This is the spot.
Get him on his sides.

634
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,463
[I have to somehow win this game.]

635
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:41,646
You won.
Kang Gary wins!

636
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,909
[Gary's record- 1.17 seconds.
Gary wins!]

637
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,829
- Am I losing my jewel?
- Yes, you've lost it.

638
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:52,208
[Only Gary gets to keep the jewel
for having won the mission.]

639
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,785
- Congratulations, Gary.
- Thank you.

640
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,684
[Yoo-ames Bond is unable to stop Gary
from moving onto the red zone.]

641
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:04,615
Since you've succeeded,
you'll be given a key to the next level.

642
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:08,451
[Gary wins a key to the red zone.]

643
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:11,377
Can I get going then?
Thank you.

644
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,432
<i>Kwang Soo.</i>

645
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:19,116
[Kwang-Buram finally shows up after
having wandered around aimlessly.]

646
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,729
We needs to start eliminating them.

647
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:28,631
[The members are climbing through the levels,
but they haven't ousted anyone yet.]

648
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,775
Jae Suk, what are you doing?

649
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,786
[Suddenly pretending to be getting
a drink of water.]

650
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:35,457
Are you getting some water?

651
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,429
- Suk Jin, did you succeed?
- No, I didn't.

652
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,967
- Jong Kook is in the blue zone already.
- He's in the blue zone?

653
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,910
Are you still in the yellow zone?
Gary's in the red zone already.

654
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:44,452
- Really?
- Gary's in the red zone.

655
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:47,107
- What's after the red zone?
- It's the black zone.

656
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:51,750
- Red zone is the third one?
- Yes, he only has two zones left.

657
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:55,881
[All the red games must be
played with three people.]

658
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,390
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- You should play this game with Ha Ha.

659
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:02,165
- Let's play a game.
- Good, I've been waiting.

660
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,702
Would the rest of you like to watch
an entertaining game?

661
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:08,184
What is it?

662
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:10,581
What is it?

663
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:18,817
[Kwang Soo slyly follows into
Jae Suk and Ha Ha's yellow mission zone.]

664
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:21,651
You're good at things like this.

665
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:24,109
[More mats of your color must be flipped up
at the end of the minute to win the mission.]

666
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,821
Should I play this or not?

667
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,638
- Ha Ha, do you want to play it with me?
- You're not a blue zone yet.

668
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,962
You're still in the yellow zone.
Should I play this or not? Play or not?

669
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:39,302
Ugh, I really can't stand you sometimes.

670
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:42,153
- What are you doing?
- Should I play it or not?

671
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,577
[What's wrong with him...]

672
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:50,970
- One, two, three, four.
- Should I play it or not...

673
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:52,701
Should I do it or not...

674
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:55,029
- What are you doing?
- That's really weird.

675
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,347
- You should've done it with us.
- It's actually pretty fun.

676
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,831
- It's just because you're jealous.
- It's actually pretty fun.

677
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:02,989
You need to come here and do it.

678
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,093
[Finally steps back behind Ha Ha.]

679
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:09,426
- One, two...
- Are you ready?

680
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:13,742
- Let's do it with some feelings this time.
- Okay, like this?

681
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:19,884
[Kwang-Buram... are you
still looking for your water gun?]

682
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:22,502
[What are you doing!]

683
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:29,932
[Something... is off?]

684
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:33,655
Ugh, seriously!

685
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,245
[He checks his own stash of jewels?]

686
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,697
- Ugh, seriously.
- I startled you, didn't I?

687
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:45,182
[Is this how Yoo-ames Bond's
dream will come to an end?]

688
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:48,371
- You're trying to steal from me?
- What?

689
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:50,041
[Huh?]

690
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:54,116
[Haroro mistakes Kwang Soo
of stealing his jewels.]

691
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:56,689
- There are five.
- No, I only have three right now.

692
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,073
- Give it back.
- Why did you do that?

693
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,245
- I seriously didn't do it.
- Just give it back.

694
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,349
[Hands over one of his jewels.]

695
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,365
- Why would you do that!
- What are you doing?

696
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:10,882
[We're just lucky... that it's Haroro.]

697
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:13,809
- Come on, let's just do this first.
- I'm not playing it!

698
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,463
[The leaky water gun is shoved down
the back of his pants?]

699
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:19,021
- Let's just finish this mission first.
- You guys are too scary.

700
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:23,648
- It's because I don't have any jewels!
- Then go out and get some on your own.

701
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:26,004
Why would you steal!

702
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:28,711
- Jae Suk, you should apologize.
- I'm sorry.

703
00:43:28,712 --> 00:43:32,793
- Should I sue or not?
- Should I do it or not?

704
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:35,208
[Problems will be shoved aside
for a little dance time first.]

705
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:39,539
- Seriously, don't do it again.
- Okay, no more.

706
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,429
- Are you allowed to steal?
- He had the bag open.

707
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,157
[He almost just got caught,
and he's rifling through again.]

708
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:47,121
You're going to steal from everyone?

709
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:51,459
You didn't steal any?
Why did you take mine earlier?

710
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,306
- It's because of you. He started it.
- People like you...

711
00:43:56,028 --> 00:43:58,858
- Why am I...
- It's because you started it.

712
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:03,452
This is all because you started it.

713
00:44:03,453 --> 00:44:05,842
- I'm sorry.
- Don't ever do that again.

714
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,162
[I vow to get it done this time!]

715
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,310
Okay, let's do the dance.

716
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:19,588
[Ready to eliminate Haroro.]

717
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:28,843
[A direct hit on Ha Ha's name tag.]

718
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:32,722
Should I do it or not...

719
00:44:32,723 --> 00:44:35,578
[It's a success.]

720
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:39,398
[Now that Ha Ha's been shot,
it's time to really dance it out.]

721
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:42,084
[Haroro has no idea
what had just happened to him.]

722
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:47,950
[This is almost sad...]

723
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:51,596
I'm not going to do this.
You're going to win this.

724
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:54,887
- You'd win this.
- Then I'm not playing it either.

725
00:44:54,888 --> 00:44:57,027
I'm not playing.

726
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,278
[There's no more reason
to be around Haroro anymore.]

727
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:04,368
- You should go do your missions!
- Okay, I'll be back.

728
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,144
[Kwang-Buram awkwardly
takes his leave.]

729
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:09,177
I can't be standing around
here like this.

730
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:13,206
[They finally eliminated one member...]

731
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:16,050
Ugh, you seriously startled me.

732
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:20,653
I told you not to hesitate with it.
You have to be quick.

733
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:23,221
Hurry up and get to the yellow zone.

734
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,829
[Senior spy is feeling apprehensive
about his successor.]

735
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:32,008
[The mark on his back
has already disappeared.]

736
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:35,343
Where's a blue zone member?

737
00:45:36,022 --> 00:45:38,354
- Ha Ha, I succeeded.
- Which one?

738
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:43,468
[Huh? How is he still walking around
when he's been shot with the water gun?]

739
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,410
Find an open door and call for me.

740
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:51,793
[Just then, a doctor comes
onto the scene.]

741
00:45:51,794 --> 00:45:53,924
I have much that I need to ask you.

742
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:56,037
[So that's how it happens...]

743
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:59,171
Doctor.

744
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:00,833
[The doctor is leading Ha Ha
away somewhere.]

745
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:03,638
[Ha Ha has no idea what's going on.]

746
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:07,676
- Please come in.
- What is this place?

747
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:09,316
[What is this?]

748
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,098
What is this?

749
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:20,050
[The place that he's been taken to..
is jail.]

750
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,600
What is this?

751
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,549
[So confused.]

752
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:28,143
Is there a spy?

753
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:34,018
[Still unable to grasp the situation.]

754
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:37,861
It's Ji Hyo, isn't it?

755
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,402
Like this... let's not spread it around.

756
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,912
[Find four metal marbles
and find the secret code.]

757
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:02,719
[All four marbles are discovered.]

758
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:04,701
In that case...

759
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:09,577
Yellow one is 'one',
and the blue one is 'five'.

760
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:14,443
Red is 'seven', and black is 'eight'.
It's 1578.

761
00:47:14,444 --> 00:47:16,819
[Secret code- 1578.]

762
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,908
I got it.

763
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:33,770
[Upgraded to the blue zone,
and earns the key for entrance.]

764
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:36,945
I had to dig through the dirt.
Ugh, that was tough.

765
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,044
Freedom!

766
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:44,606
- Miss Blank, did you win something?
- I just finally succeeded.

767
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:47,435
- What did you succeed in?
- I had to dig through the dirt.

768
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,796
- Wow, this is awesome.
- I don't know what's happened to him.

769
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:54,048
- Are you in the blue zone?
- Yes, I'm in the blue zone.

770
00:47:55,112 --> 00:47:59,065
[Yoo-ames Bond and Kwang-Buram
are back together again.]

771
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:04,766
[Now that I look at the situation,
we're back together again?]

772
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,917
Let's get to a blue zone mission,
and move onto the next level.

773
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,733
- One of us three has to move on.
- I think it's over that way.

774
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:14,298
[Ji Hyo is our next mark.]

775
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,161
We can't go that way.

776
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:24,558
[Kwang Soo readies his water gun.]

777
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:37,150
[Quietly sneaks up on Ji Hyo's back.]

778
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:40,612
[Target locked.]

779
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:48,976
[A direct hit on her name tag.]

780
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,230
Where is it?

781
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:54,265
[Hides his water gun away
as soon as his mission is over.]

782
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,845
Someone must've done something.

783
00:48:57,492 --> 00:49:00,698
- What if they're just in the room?
- There they are.

784
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:02,446
[They just need to make up an excuse
and flee from Ji Hyo's side.]

785
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:05,974
- Kwang Soo, you can't go in there.
- No, you can't go in there.

786
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:09,426
<i>- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?</i>

787
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:13,975
[Kwang Soo... that was perfect.]

788
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:21,175
- Please follow me.
- Me?

789
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:23,914
Why do you need me?
I have to get to the blue zone.

790
00:49:23,915 --> 00:49:25,716
You'll know once you follow me.

791
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:28,719
[Okay, two members have
been ousted...]

792
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,221
[But their biggest concern still remains.]

793
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:37,695
Ugh, I'm feeling so nervous
and anxious.

794
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:39,861
Ugh, stress!

795
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,186
What is this?

796
00:49:43,187 --> 00:49:45,856
[Blank Ji is following the doctor's lead
without even knowing what's going on.]

797
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:49,849
- I think you've been disqualified.
- Why?

798
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,742
I think it's Jae Suk.

799
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,704
- I'm out?
- I think I'm out, too.

800
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:57,912
Was he going after your jewels at all?

801
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:02,327
[Still trying to figure out
how they've been ousted.]

802
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:12,008
I need to get this mission done
before someone else comes up here.

803
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,683
[Gary is already onto the red zone.]

804
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:16,275
[But he hasn't been able to
open up any of the rooms yet.]

805
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:24,561
[The first person to untie and take the belt
from their opponent wins the game.]

806
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:27,130
I'll help you.

807
00:50:27,131 --> 00:50:28,446
[Kwang Soo is getting ready
to face Big-nose.]

808
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,772
I think you tie it like this.

809
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:35,782
[The water gun!]

810
00:50:40,546 --> 00:50:43,114
[Swoops down to pick it back up.]

811
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:48,637
[Yoo-ames Bond starts acting funny
from feeling flustered.]

812
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,560
Just help him instead.
What are you trying to pull here?

813
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,990
What are you trying to do?

814
00:50:58,012 --> 00:51:00,429
[Seriously!]

815
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:04,917
I'll stay right by your side,
so don't worry about anything.

816
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:07,852
He's treating me like a total idiot.

817
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:10,715
We both started Running Man
at the same time.

818
00:51:10,716 --> 00:51:11,768
[Kwang-Buram was feeling so confident...]

819
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:20,573
[I can't believe that he's my successor.]

820
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:24,413
- I need to get to the red zone.
- I need to get there too.

821
00:51:27,745 --> 00:51:31,233
[Since we're already in this mess,
I'm just going to do this myself.]

822
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:36,537
[Hands it off to Yoo-ames Bond.]

823
00:51:37,123 --> 00:51:39,311
[I'll shoot.]

824
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,503
[Then I'll grab him.]

825
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:46,194
[They're now ready to oust Big-nose.]

826
00:51:47,155 --> 00:51:49,741
- The winner of this game will go with you.
- Okay.

827
00:51:50,178 --> 00:51:52,242
Ready, set, go.

828
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,783
[Kwang Soo vs Big-nose.]

829
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,339
Suk Jin's stronger than he looks.

830
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:13,463
[Now's the chance...]

831
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,128
[Kwang Soo, keep holding onto him.]

832
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:18,154
[Jae Suk, now's our chance.]

833
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:25,056
[Closes in on Big-nose's name tag.]

834
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:31,340
[Opens fire.]

835
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:34,419
[Since I've already got it out,
one more shot.]

836
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:38,284
[Bulls eye on Big-nose's name tag.]

837
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:40,092
[We got it!]

838
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,621
[Big-nose still has
a cheery look on his face.]

839
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:45,678
That's pretty impressive.
It's like a UFC fight.

840
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,377
The winner gets to come with me.

841
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:52,321
Okay, that's how you play the game.

842
00:52:52,322 --> 00:52:55,319
[A meaningless move by someone
who's already been ousted.]

843
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:02,645
[Kwang Soo succeeds the mission.]

844
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,206
[Loses the game,
and shot by the water gun, too.]

845
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:08,026
Wow, Suk Jin's really strong.

846
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:13,030
[Only two more left to eliminate...]

847
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:18,531
I must be needed for
something important?

848
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:29,218
[Kwang-Buram, seemingly
nervous about something.]

849
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:33,831
The solution keeps leaking out.

850
00:53:35,385 --> 00:53:39,727
[Almost didn't even get to oust Suk Jin
from the lack of solution in the water gun.]

851
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:46,724
[Startled by the smallest bit of noise
in his agitated state.]

852
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:51,559
[The water gun newbie even struggles
to get the solution in the chamber.]

853
00:53:53,384 --> 00:53:55,796
I think that should be enough.

854
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:59,218
[Gary and Jong Kook are the only two
left to eliminate.]

855
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,634
[But why does it have to be
the two strongest opponents?]

856
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:06,628
[Will be he able to safely
complete his mission?]

857
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,002
[Jae Suk marks Jong Kook as his
next target and follows him in.]

858
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:15,981
Since we're allowed to tackle each other,
let's make this entertaining.

859
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:19,551
Wait, are you trying to turn this
into a physical battle?

860
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:23,914
- Listen, I'm in a dire situation right now.
- I'm in a dire situation myself.

861
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:26,864
- How many do you have?
- I have to move on to the next level.

862
00:54:26,899 --> 00:54:28,583
- How many do you have?
- How is that important?

863
00:54:28,584 --> 00:54:30,403
- The number is very important.
- Why?

864
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:34,326
- Tell me what you have right now.
- Let's just do this and move up a level.

865
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:37,712
- Ugh, seriously.
- Okay, bet a jewel.

866
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:40,489
I'll take the blue panels,
and you can take the red.

867
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,191
- Seriously...
- Wait.

868
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:45,169
- I'm blue, right?
- That's right.

869
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,400
- Hey, did you pass?
- No, I can't find a room.

870
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:50,348
Then wait here for a minute.

871
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:54,948
- I'm going to beat him, and come with you.
- The winner of this game can come with me.

872
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:57,118
- Okay, I will.
- Okay, that sounds good.

873
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,735
Set, go!

874
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:06,847
[A forceful body check
as soon as the game starts.]

875
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,610
[Jae Suk...]

876
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:15,625
[Yoo-ames Bond is held tightly
in Kkuk's embrace.]

877
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:20,833
[Strong as a bull, Kkuk, is playing the game
with Jae Suk wrapped around his waist.]

878
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,160
- Help me, Kwang Soo.
- How am I to help you with that?

879
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,250
Kwang Soo, help me!

880
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:29,305
What are you doing to him?

881
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:32,361
This is really wounding my pride.
Kwang Soo!

882
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:37,418
Jae Suk, there are still four left.
Gather up your strength and do it.

883
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:39,174
[There are only four more
red squares left.]

884
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:41,272
Jae Suk!

885
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:44,308
Jae Suk, you look like a baby
that's been painted with white paint.

886
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:46,449
[Utter insult.]

887
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:52,126
[The winner has been already determined,
but Kkuk is going for the record.]

888
00:55:54,836 --> 00:55:56,426
[Ten seconds left on the clock.]

889
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:59,513
Kwang Soo...
Kwang Soo!

890
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,701
[Time's up.]

891
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,895
[Even though Kkuk is his enemy,
he's still impressed.]

892
00:56:09,896 --> 00:56:13,375
- Okay, it's over.
- That was the perfect game.

893
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,476
[All blue.]

894
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,832
[Kkuk, with the perfect win.]

895
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,272
- Ugh, I'm so aggravated.
- It's over.

896
00:56:21,273 --> 00:56:23,819
- Congratulations, Jong Kook.
- Thanks.

897
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:27,056
That Kim Jong Kook...

898
00:56:27,057 --> 00:56:28,899
[I will get my revenge with
the water gun.]

899
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,639
Thank you.

900
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,228
[Jong Kook wins the key to the
red zone with his victory.]

901
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:38,776
He's on a different level from us.

902
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:42,093
[This frightening human being...
Must oust him before he gets any further.]

903
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:46,885
[All three step out of the room.]

904
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:51,060
Where did Suk Jin go?
He's not in the red zone yet?

905
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:54,156
That's strange.
Something feels very strange.

906
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:58,370
Kwang Soo's acting really strange today.

907
00:56:59,863 --> 00:57:04,534
He kept staring at us while
we were playing our mission.

908
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:07,776
- I was going to go with the winner.
- Are you a spy?

909
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:11,165
What game is it that you want to play?
You're acting really weird.

910
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:15,206
- I haven't found a room yet.
- Then why do you want us to come with you?

911
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:18,717
I was going to wait for the winner
to go and find the room together.

912
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:23,991
- Have you found any rooms yet?
- Yeah, I just found one.

913
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:26,765
- Where is it? What's the mission?
- He's acting really strange.

914
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:32,820
- Or is he just that strange all the time?
- I think you're overly sensitive right now.

915
00:57:32,821 --> 00:57:35,201
- Am I being too suspicious?
- You tend to be that way.

916
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,899
- I'm really not that strange.
- I never realized that about Kwang Soo.

917
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,133
But when you mentioned that
he was strange...

918
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:44,853
[Yoo-ames Bond tries to distract Jong Kook
from the suspicion that he's feeling.]

919
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:47,275
- Gary's found a room.
- Really?

920
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:52,545
[Who will be the one to enter
the black zone first?]

921
00:57:52,546 --> 00:57:54,809
- What's this?
- I wonder what it could be?

922
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,747
- It looks like Gary's office.
- What is this?

923
00:57:56,748 --> 00:57:58,714
- I think we can do this.
- What is this?

924
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:01,214
- What is this? Why are our name tags here?
- What is it?

925
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:04,228
We have to rip off the name tags
without the use of our hands.

926
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:06,660
- You can't utilize your hands.
- No, of course not.

927
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:10,517
- Please hand over one of your jewels.
- I feel like Gary's already checked this out.

928
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:12,369
You've already practiced this, haven't you?

929
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,925
- Can I play this? I can't, can I?
- You're still in the blue zone.

930
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:18,440
You can't play when
you're not even on our level.

931
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,031
[How dare the blue belt even try!]

932
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,390
Why did you come here
when you're not even on our level?

933
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:27,260
Just watch us play the game.
You can sit in the viewer's gallery.

934
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:28,667
[I'm actually here to take you down.]

935
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,257
- Why don't we all start here?
- Okay, let's start here.

936
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,788
[It's yet undecided as to who will
enter the black zone first.]

937
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:39,997
As I'm sure you've all guessed already,
your own name tags...

938
00:58:39,998 --> 00:58:42,291
Ugh, seriously.
You're such a dirty player!

939
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,469
He just asked me to rip it off for him.

940
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,285
- What are you doing?
- What are you trying to do here?

941
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:51,681
[Red Zone Mission-
Self-name tag elimination- Start.]

942
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:02,950
[Oh?]

943
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,677
[Kwang Soo is using the ledge
of the TV stand.]

944
00:59:06,678 --> 00:59:09,742
[Just then...]

945
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:11,198
Okay!

946
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,436
[Huh?]

947
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:15,414
[Already?]

948
00:59:18,284 --> 00:59:20,807
[Kkuk runs over to the door wall
as soon as the game starts.]

949
00:59:21,403 --> 00:59:25,473
[Sticks the name tag between the crack...]

950
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:31,612
[In one swoop... wins the game.]

951
00:59:33,132 --> 00:59:36,769
[Wow, he really is something else.]

952
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,144
Can't you just do it normally
like the rest of us?

953
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:41,256
You were just going to
scratch it off on the ledge?

954
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:45,183
The moment he did that, you
guys looked like a bunch of cavemen.

955
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:49,038
You know what that means, don't you?
The skills you were using compared to him...

956
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,003
He's the advanced sort, while
you're still using caveman methods.

957
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,567
[Caveman methods.]

958
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:01,527
- Then is he going off to the black zone?
- He just won the key to the black zone.

959
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:03,011
[Jong Kook wins the key
to the black zone.]

960
01:00:07,253 --> 01:00:09,875
[Black zone is the final level
in his attempt to save himself.]

961
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:14,422
[One of the black doors is the room
that's housing their sought after bodies.]

962
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:25,031
[The moment Jong Kook finds that room,
the race ends with Jong Kook's victory.]

963
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:30,629
The moment one of the members finds the
room and their body that's contained within

964
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:33,033
then the race will come to an end,
and both of you will lose.

965
01:00:34,305 --> 01:00:37,411
- You win as soon as you find the right room?
- That's right.

966
01:00:37,412 --> 01:00:39,690
[Jong Kook must be ousted before
he finds the correct room.]

967
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,455
I hope that you get eliminated
the moment you open the door.

968
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:49,009
Why are you saying that?
Why are you saying that to me?

969
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,647
If this door opens, then
he immediately wins the race.

970
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:57,201
I don't think this one will open.
I saw much bigger doors than this earlier.

971
01:00:57,202 --> 01:00:59,467
[The two come around to
surround Jong Kook.]

972
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:04,479
[Pretends to be checking out the lock.]

973
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,750
Something feels very strange here.

974
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:08,708
[Mr. Capable smells
something fishy going on.]

975
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:11,136
Jae Suk, pull your hands
out of your pockets.

976
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:15,412
Come here, Jae Suk.

977
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,062
[Have I been caught?]

978
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:20,645
[Jong Kook is attempting to
check his pockets.]

979
01:01:20,646 --> 01:01:22,949
- What are you trying to do?
- You really are too much.

980
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,479
[The water gun is thankfully
in Kwang Soo's pocket.]

981
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,799
Something's not right here.
Check my name tag.

982
01:01:27,444 --> 01:01:29,605
- There's nothing on there.
- Is it okay?

983
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:32,457
Jae Suk is acting really strange.
I was trying to open the door...

984
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,523
then when I caught him
looking at me...

985
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:38,095
[After hearing Jong Kook's story,
Gary now has a suspicious look in his eyes.]

986
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:40,285
- Does that makes any sense to you?
- No, it doesn't.

987
01:01:40,286 --> 01:01:44,314
[Yoo-ames Bond and Kwang-Buram
are in extreme danger.]

988
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:48,317
- Then he suddenly started looking elsewhere.
- Is there something in here?

989
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:50,624
[Jae Suk, what are we going to do?]

990
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,415
- What's going on here?
- Why did you look into the keyhole?

991
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:56,457
- Why is your hand in your pocket?
- I'll be honest with you.

992
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:02,090
[Is he honestly going to
tell them about their secret mission?]

993
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,909
I was trying to steal your diamond.

994
01:02:07,379 --> 01:02:10,415
- Why are you doing that!
- Because I don't have many left.

995
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,697
- Ugh, seriously.
- Okay, mine are still here.

996
01:02:12,698 --> 01:02:16,327
- Hey! Don't be like this, too!
- I'm not trusting anyone anymore.

997
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:18,398
[Mr. Gary lets go of his suspicions
and just goes on his way.]

998
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:20,835
- Ugh, seriously.
- Why are you acting like this?

999
01:02:20,836 --> 01:02:24,280
- I'm sorry, but you still have five!
- No, I only have four.

1000
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:26,651
- I only have two left.
- We don't have many left.

1001
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:30,570
- Just give us one.
- The rule says that I can't give you one.

1002
01:02:30,605 --> 01:02:32,750
But I was told that stealing is allowed.

1003
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:36,363
[Being shameless is the way to survival.]

1004
01:02:36,364 --> 01:02:38,913
- That's right, stealing is allowed.
- Just keep going.

1005
01:02:38,914 --> 01:02:41,518
We don't know what we may
end up needing them for.

1006
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:43,675
I wish I could give you one, too.

1007
01:02:44,196 --> 01:02:46,370
[The newbie successor's expression
is frozen on his face.]

1008
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:49,860
Jae Suk, find the blue zone room,
and finish the mission there.

1009
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:53,277
But I have to find a room that unlocks first.
What if I end up losing another one?

1010
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:58,844
- Hey, if I end up losing another jewel...
- You can come and see me then.

1011
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:00,983
Come and see me when you only
have one jewel left.

1012
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:03,926
- If I lose another one, then it's over.
- Come see me when you have one life left.

1013
01:03:03,927 --> 01:03:07,673
- I pretty much gave you that red mission.
- Okay.

1014
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,818
Come and see me when you only have
one life left, okay?

1015
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:14,130
[This is the time to take down
our most formidable opponent.]

1016
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:22,509
[A direct hit on Kkuk's name tag.]

1017
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:29,161
[Shoots the water gun,
and an obvious blank look on his face.]

1018
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:33,394
- I'm going to search for my room.
- Okay.

1019
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:36,363
But where did everyone go?
Why haven't I seen anyone around?

1020
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,799
- You're really...
- There's a big black door on the 4th floor.

1021
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,647
I'm going to go and check that out.
Keep checking down here.

1022
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:48,042
I hope about ten taekwondo masters
fly out and put an end to you there.

1023
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:51,058
- Let me know if you find anything here.
- Okay.

1024
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:53,866
Kwang Soo, come here.

1025
01:03:56,668 --> 01:04:00,008
[Elimination of Mr. Capable had the
two shaking in their shoes.]

1026
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:04,705
I could smell the alcohol in the solution,
and I was scared he'd catch that, too.

1027
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:07,566
We could've been in big trouble earlier.

1028
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:11,693
- Why do you hesitate so much?
- But that was Jong Kook!

1029
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:13,964
We still have Gary left to eliminate.

1030
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:17,609
- Gary's the only one left.
- Yes, we just need to eliminate Gary now.

1031
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,289
Gary can't even move on
to the black zone anymore.

1032
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:27,436
If it hadn't been for Ha Ha earlier,
Jong Kook may never have fallen for it.

1033
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:31,929
- Heaven is looking out for us.
- You're right.

1034
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,204
We have to win this.

1035
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:36,077
If it hadn't been for Ha Ha's attempt earlier,
I would've been at a loss for what to say.

1036
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:39,138
Wow, I can't believe he
fell for that story.

1037
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,397
How did you even think to
say that though?

1038
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,358
[Still trying to figure out
how he was ousted.]

1039
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,495
[Loading the chamber with
the final hunt looming ahead.]

1040
01:04:53,713 --> 01:04:55,799
Okay, Gary's the only one left to go.

1041
01:04:56,742 --> 01:04:59,094
I just need to eliminate him to win.

1042
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,529
[Once Gary is eliminated, then the
successor's mission is complete.]

1043
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:10,391
[Mr. Gary has somehow survived
long enough to become the last target.]

1044
01:05:10,392 --> 01:05:13,406
[After having lost the previous game,
he's on the search for another red room.]

1045
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,081
[Just then, Kwang-Buram is seen
walking towards the red zone.]

1046
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:25,852
[Opens the door with the master key.]

1047
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:29,767
[Going along with Jae Suk's plan
to lure Gary over to the room.]

1048
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:31,799
It's the chair race!

1049
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,827
I'm really good at this game.

1050
01:05:33,828 --> 01:05:37,041
<i>Three players must be seated in
each one of the chairs</i>

1051
01:05:37,042 --> 01:05:39,271
<i>and the first person to cross
the finish line wins the race.</i>

1052
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,142
[Huh?]

1053
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,114
[What are you doing?]

1054
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,830
[The water gun newbie is playing out
a scene during a crucial moment like this?]

1055
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:58,235
[I see you've been wanting
to do this for a long time...]

1056
01:05:58,844 --> 01:06:01,987
[Playing out the agent game
to his heart's content.]

1057
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:07,775
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1058
01:06:09,207 --> 01:06:10,852
[Just then, Mr. Gary enters the room.]

1059
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,375
- Why didn't you call for me?
- Where have you been, Gary?

1060
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:17,732
I've been looking all over for you.

1061
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:22,542
- Why didn't you call for me?
- I just walked in here.

1062
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,968
You were trying to do something
by yourself, weren't you?

1063
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:28,816
[If it had been anyone else but Gary,
then he would've been totally caught!]

1064
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:31,896
- It's the chair race.
- Seriously?

1065
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:36,486
[Awkward Kwang-Buram... How is he
to become the successor like this?]

1066
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,521
I haven't even seen Ji Hyo around.

1067
01:06:40,522 --> 01:06:43,264
- Hey, what is this?
- Did you pass?

1068
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,241
- Did you pass?
- I just passed.

1069
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:47,065
Come on, let's hurry.

1070
01:06:47,475 --> 01:06:50,481
- This mission is too hard.
- What is this?

1071
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:53,598
[The two spies are in a hurry to
finish the game and win the mission.]

1072
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:58,738
- It's tough to win with these chairs.
- Is Jong Kook searching for the black room?

1073
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:01,428
- I don't know.
- Why isn't anyone else around?

1074
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:04,843
- Suk Jin was the last person I saw.
- I haven't seen anyone around.

1075
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:06,341
That's what I'm saying.

1076
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:09,692
- You have to bet a jewel.
- Do you know anything?

1077
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,872
No, I don't know anything.

1078
01:07:14,315 --> 01:07:16,783
You know I can't hide things
like that.

1079
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,513
I'm seriously not hiding anything.

1080
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:24,348
[Jae Suk is now pretending
to be checking Kwang Soo out.]

1081
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:27,257
You each have to bet a jewel
before you can play this mission.

1082
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:32,295
- We can't touch the floor with our feet?
- Make sure that Kwang Soo doesn't cheat.

1083
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:36,755
- These chairs are tough.
- Let's not go over the line.

1084
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:38,463
I'm not going over the line.

1085
01:07:38,464 --> 01:07:40,567
Ready, set...

1086
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:45,172
[Will Gary's body be found first,
or will they oust him first?]

1087
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:49,660
[Chair race- Start.]

1088
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:54,204
[All three are racing toward
their own personal goals.]

1089
01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:56,167
I think I may be able to win this.

1090
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:57,492
[Jae Suk takes the lead.]

1091
01:08:01,684 --> 01:08:05,943
[Just then... Gary suddenly takes the lead.]

1092
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,764
[Gary is in the clear lead.]

1093
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,241
[Kwang-Buram stays close
on Gary's heels.]

1094
01:08:14,242 --> 01:08:17,354
[We can't let you win the game!]

1095
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:21,124
Push me.
You have to push me!

1096
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:23,761
I said, push me!

1097
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:34,425
[Will Gary win the black key,
or will the duo win the mission?]

1098
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:41,802
[Gary wins the mission!]

1099
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:46,285
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1100
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,789
That really hurts.

1101
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,845
- My butt really hurts!
- That was a brutal game.

1102
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:56,003
Gary, that was a really brutal game.

1103
01:08:56,749 --> 01:09:00,352
Hey, why couldn't you have
played better?

1104
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:03,052
You should've pushed me
towards the line.

1105
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:06,704
Give me back my jewel.
I may be able to win this.

1106
01:09:06,705 --> 01:09:09,714
Okay!

1107
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:11,712
[Gary wins the black key.]

1108
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:16,230
[We can't let him walk away like this...]

1109
01:09:16,231 --> 01:09:17,899
Sorry.

1110
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,622
[Gary rushes off to the black zone.]

1111
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:24,405
- We're right behind you.
- Wait for us.

1112
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:29,947
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- I don't have any solution.

1113
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:34,891
- Why didn't you reload?
- It keeps leaking.

1114
01:09:36,524 --> 01:09:39,506
[He used it all up while playing out
his agent scene earlier.]

1115
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:44,420
You're driving me insane.
Why don't you carry the solution around?

1116
01:09:44,863 --> 01:09:49,401
- Hurry up and reload.
- Ugh, seriously.

1117
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,843
[Jae Suk ends up reloading for Kwang Soo.]

1118
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:56,929
You're a total mess.
I would've ended it a half hour ago.

1119
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:00,716
- I know that I made a slight mistake...
- No, you even dropped the gun earlier!

1120
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:03,294
- Gary's the only one left.
- This is our last one.

1121
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:05,957
- Let's get this done.
- I know that this isn't easy.

1122
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,817
This is really hard.

1123
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:11,815
I don't think the water gun is my style.

1124
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,262
The moment you hesitate,
that's when you die.

1125
01:10:15,657 --> 01:10:18,150
There's no need to go that far.

1126
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,417
[The teacher and the successor
aren't a very good fit.]

1127
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:25,251
[Off to get their last target, Gary.]

1128
01:10:25,252 --> 01:10:27,729
It's all over the moment
you and I eliminate Gary, right?

1129
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,831
- What did you say?
- After we oust Gary...

1130
01:10:29,832 --> 01:10:32,331
Are you planning on betraying me?

1131
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:35,263
You still have one final test left to go.

1132
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:41,023
[If Gary can clear the black zone mission,
then he wins the race.]

1133
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:45,366
Why isn't anyone around?

1134
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:49,386
[Sees a black door!]

1135
01:10:51,108 --> 01:10:56,962
[Either his body awaits him, or a
mission waits behind these doors.]

1136
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:01,629
[It opened!]

1137
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:07,059
[What will he find inside?]

1138
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:10,444
What is this?

1139
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,376
<i>Memorize the boards on the monitor</i>

1140
01:11:15,377 --> 01:11:20,371
<i>Move from the start to finish mark
in the order that is shown on the monitor.</i>

1141
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:23,751
- You're only going to show it once?
- Yes, just once.

1142
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:38,523
Are you kidding me?
What are you guys doing?

1143
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:44,905
[Must go in the order shown.]

1144
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,531
I think I can get it in one try.

1145
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,429
[Fumbling through his memory
and taking it one step at a time.]

1146
01:11:53,354 --> 01:11:55,616
[Onto his fifth step already
without any mistakes.]

1147
01:11:55,968 --> 01:11:58,231
Ugh, I'm starting to get confused.

1148
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:06,127
[A safe step.]

1149
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,505
[Next is his seventh step!]

1150
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:14,613
[Fails the first of three attempts.]

1151
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:17,024
Ugh, this is too hard.

1152
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:19,988
[They must oust Gary
before he succeeds.]

1153
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,054
Where's Gary?

1154
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:25,773
Since I got that one wrong...

1155
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,890
[Fails the second attempt.]

1156
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:36,713
[It's a battle against time.
Who will end it first?]

1157
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:38,107
What could it be?

1158
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:42,420
[Victory is right in front of his eyes!
Starting his third and final attempt.]

1159
01:12:43,107 --> 01:12:45,811
- Did you succeed?
- Did you?

1160
01:12:45,812 --> 01:12:47,571
[They must shoot before
Gary succeeds!]

1161
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:51,818
[There's no time!
Get out the water gun!]

1162
01:12:55,408 --> 01:12:59,832
[He only needs to shoot!]

1163
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:08,219
- What's wrong with him?
- What are you doing!

1164
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,224
Why are you ruining my game!

1165
01:13:11,605 --> 01:13:14,319
[Gary has no idea what just happened,
and is actually happy for the help.]

1166
01:13:15,342 --> 01:13:18,671
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- What's wrong with you!

1167
01:13:18,672 --> 01:13:21,244
- I know what to do now.
- Sorry, Gary.

1168
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:24,802
Wait a minute.
Don't come near me!

1169
01:13:24,837 --> 01:13:26,858
- Gary.
- I know what to do now.

1170
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:37,363
[A chaotic self-congratulatory ceremony.]

1171
01:13:39,645 --> 01:13:41,468
Wait, I know this one!

1172
01:13:42,936 --> 01:13:46,860
[Gary's unaware of what's happened,
and celebrates his win.]

1173
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:50,275
That could've been big trouble.

1174
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:52,549
Thanks, Jae Suk and Kwang Soo!

1175
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,148
[Falls through even the last hole.]

1176
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:58,100
- Gary, thanks so much.
- Thank you, Gary.

1177
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,933
[For what?]

1178
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:04,631
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- Didn't I just win?

1179
01:14:07,885 --> 01:14:10,511
Why can't you recognize this?

1180
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,695
[Reveals the water gun.]

1181
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,327
[What is this?]

1182
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:19,332
We had it out in the open,
but Gary still didn't notice it.

1183
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,292
[Feels even worse because
Gary is so oblivious to it.]

1184
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:23,173
Again?

1185
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:26,928
Come on, don't do this!

1186
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,043
- Where did you get me?
- It's already disappeared.

1187
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:32,380
[I thought I was going to win today!]

1188
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,866
- What's he supposed to be?
- My pupil.

1189
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:36,826
I'm Kwang-Buram.

1190
01:14:36,827 --> 01:14:39,544
- When I'm so close to the end?
- Yes.

1191
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:41,246
[So close to winning!]

1192
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:45,135
- Had we been a little later...
- Why is this happening to me!

1193
01:14:45,136 --> 01:14:47,671
I seriously thought I was going to win!

1194
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,448
- Sorry, Gary.
- Don't do this to me!

1195
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,641
Gary, I'm so sorry.

1196
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:57,629
[Final member, Gary, is ousted.
Yoo-ames Bond and Kwang-Buram win.]

1197
01:14:58,089 --> 01:15:00,063
Okay, let's take these off.

1198
01:15:00,064 --> 01:15:04,862
[But this isn't the end!]

1199
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,109
<i>As of today, you will officially
become an agent.</i>

1200
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:13,672
<i>The final step, which is another test...</i>

1201
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:20,640
<i>only when all the members have been ousted,
and you and I are the only ones left...</i>

1202
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:25,229
<i>that's when I'll reveal
the final test to you.</i>

1203
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,261
[What is the final test
that he'll have to face?]

1204
01:15:30,246 --> 01:15:33,825
- Is it all over?
- No, there's one final step left.

1205
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:37,753
- There's a final step?
- Kwang Soo.

1206
01:15:38,908 --> 01:15:41,948
Rip off my name tag.

1207
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,284
I want you to take off my name tag.

1208
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:45,947
[Why does he want him to do that?]

1209
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:47,750
Listen to me carefully.

1210
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:56,610
The moment I hand this water gun over to you,
you have to immediately make a decision.

1211
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:58,161
You can't hesitate.

1212
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:02,103
If you shoot my name tag on
the count of three

1213
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:10,127
then you'll be doing the water gun specials
all by yourself from now on.

1214
01:16:11,228 --> 01:16:14,786
But... if on the count of three...
No, wait.

1215
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:17,361
No, hear me out first.

1216
01:16:17,714 --> 01:16:19,864
Hear me out, Kwang Soo.

1217
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:21,635
[He can't help his instincts
from coming out.]

1218
01:16:21,636 --> 01:16:24,811
If you don't shoot on the
count of three...

1219
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:29,362
then we will continue on as
Yoo-ames Bond and Kwang-Buram.

1220
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:32,229
We can continue on with these specials
with the two of us as partners.

1221
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,854
- I'll do it alone if I shoot.
- Yes, you alone.

1222
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:39,729
Then I'll become a part of history.
Yoo-ames Bond and the water gun is no more.

1223
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:41,839
[The shooting of the water gun will be
a forever farewell to Yoo-ames Bond.]

1224
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,505
Wait.

1225
01:16:43,827 --> 01:16:46,773
[You need to think about this first!]

1226
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:50,267
On the count of three, okay?
Have you made your decision?

1227
01:16:50,268 --> 01:16:52,092
- Yes.
- You need to think about it.

1228
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:55,539
Here.
Take the water gun.

1229
01:16:56,018 --> 01:16:57,983
It'll be on the count of three.

1230
01:16:59,044 --> 01:17:03,399
[Time to determine their fate.]

1231
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:10,756
[Will it be the two together,
or Kwang Soo on his own?]

1232
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:19,149
[The end of this water gun's barrel
will determine the fate of history.]

1233
01:17:19,564 --> 01:17:21,637
I have faith in your decision.

1234
01:17:22,162 --> 01:17:25,563
I don't wish for Yoo-ames Bond
to come to an end.

1235
01:17:26,737 --> 01:17:37,350
[Just what will he choose?]

1236
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:45,239
[The water gun backfires.]

1237
01:17:46,814 --> 01:17:50,730
[How did this happen?]

1238
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:56,021
[About 30 minutes ago, while Gary and
Kwang Soo were waiting for the chair race.]

1239
01:17:56,022 --> 01:17:59,542
[Jae Suk chooses a water gun
from the ammunition room.]

1240
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:07,715
This will determine whether Kwang Soo and I
will continue to work together or not.

1241
01:18:09,192 --> 01:18:11,210
This is his final test.

1242
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:14,488
Let's go.

1243
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:20,754
[This was the final test that
Yoo-ames Bond had put in place.]

1244
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:29,185
[Traitor, Kwang Soo, fails the final test
just as Yoo-ames Bond had predicted.]

1245
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:32,515
Just as I had predicted.

1246
01:18:33,364 --> 01:18:35,673
Just as I had predicted.

1247
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:39,118
You're finished.

1248
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:41,479
I, alone, will continue with
the water guns.

1249
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,117
- You're finished.
- What is this?

1250
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,118
If you hadn't shot the water gun,
then both of us would've won.

1251
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:48,979
But since you shot the water gun...
You, traitor.

1252
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:53,182
You cannot be changed.
You cannot become a secret agent.

1253
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:56,345
[Kwang-Buram self-terminates.]

1254
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:59,263
- Wait...
- The original Bond.

1255
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:02,304
Me!
And the second Bond...

1256
01:19:03,241 --> 01:19:06,915
- Will forever be...
- What are you doing!

1257
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,285
I'm Kwang-Buram!

1258
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:12,237
I'm Kwang-Buram!

1259
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,999
Yoo-ames Bond makes his return,
and alone, he shall remain.

1260
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,663
- Am I finished?
- Kwang-Buram... goodbye.

1261
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:25,718
What is this!

1262
01:19:28,584 --> 01:19:32,117
- But I eliminated everyone!
- Yoo-ames Bond will live on.

1263
01:19:32,118 --> 01:19:35,309
- Coming soon!
- Kwang-Buram is finished?

1264
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:38,483
No!

1265
