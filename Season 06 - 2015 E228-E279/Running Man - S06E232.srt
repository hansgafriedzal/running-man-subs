00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,925
[A very special reunion.]

6
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:35,425
Today, your friends came
to pay a visit.

7
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,225
Are they really our friends?

8
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:39,000
They must be our real friends.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,775
[I wonder who they are.]

10
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:44,000
- The first guest is my friend?
[Jong Kook's friend will come out first]

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,799
- I have many friends.
- Is it Jung Nam (A Turbo member)?

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,350
Come out, Friend!

13
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,700
Who is it?

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,920
[ I missed you, Jong Kook.]

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,070
- Come out, Friend!
- It's Kyung Min!

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,450
[The Korean Ricky Martin,

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,099
[Is that Kyung Min?]

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,750

- He's Jong Kook's real friend.

19

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,350

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,750
[Kyung Min, a newlywed groom.]

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,750
It's been a while.
Congratulations!

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,700
- I went to your wedding, you know.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,050
[Everybody's saying
that they attended his wedding.]

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,800
Jae Suk didn't go.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,075
I was hosting a TV Show.

27
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,150
But I paid more for you than Suk Jin.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,025
You did?

29
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,970
[He did, Suk Jin.]
- I did.

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,470
- I know how much you gave him.
- Don't give too much, it makes me look bad.

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,350
Kyung Min is really close
to Jong Kook.

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,099
[They are both the year of the Dragon, along
with Jang Hyuk, Jo Sung Mo,and Hong Kyung In.]

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,199
Many people already know
that he and I are good friends.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,200
It's not a big surprise to see me
as Jong Kook's friend.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,400
- But I have seen the other guests.
- You've seen them?

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,499
And I had to ask them...

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,400
'Who are you friends with?'

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,076
- I have no friends.
- Who did they invite?

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,525
I didn't expect to see them.
[It's unpredictable.]

40
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,520
I think that's why I came out first.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,775
[Who is this unexpected guest?]

42
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,770
It's going to be Ji Hyo's friend.

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,550
My friend!

44
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,975
My friend!

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,750
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

46
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,200
Ji Soo!

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Ji Soo!

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,925
[The pure and innocent.
Kim Ji Soo.]

49
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:37,190
- She's not her friend.
- Are they close?

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,475
[Everyone's puzzled to see Ji Soo.]
- Ji Soo is not Ji Hyo's friend.

51
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:42,700
- She's my Sister.
- Hello?

52
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:45,100
[9 years older sister, Ji Soo.]

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,100
It would be nice if I were her age.

54
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,775
I used to carry a laminated photo
of you when I was younger.

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,075
- Are you really close to Ji Hyo?
- We were in the same agency before.

56
00:02:56,075 --> 00:03:00,999
We've known each other for
10 years now.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,550
We never worked together
but we were beer buddies.

58
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,400
[They got close by drinking together.]

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,970
Now you're talking about
your true colors.

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,575
She was MC'ing when I debuted.

61
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,899
<i>She was the MC for the show

[First start of the turbo engine]

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,400
[He started to act like a tiger.]

69
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,850
Friend!
I wonder if it's Song Eun Yi .

70
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,850
Maybe Eun Yi will come out.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,125
[Who is this man?]

72
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,190
Friend!

73
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,700
Who is it?

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,420
[Original Flower Boy,
Kim Won Joon.]

75
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,550
It's Won Joon.

76
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,650

- Yes, he's my friend.

77
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,990

- He's my friend, so stay back.
- He's my friend as well.

90
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,499
[They are suddenly competing with
each other for Won Joon.]

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,499
Won Joon is my friend

92

we are the same age

93
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,299
- and we went to the same school.
- Class of 1991.

94

The class of 1991 is still very active.

Hwi Jae, Jae Suk, and Do Yeon.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,299
- Who is Do Hyun?
- Jeon Do Yeon.

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,925
Oh, I was thinking of Yoon Do Hyun.

98
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,575
So, what happened to 'OHD'?

99
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:48,399
[Arrogant walking]
- At that time, I debuted as a singer.

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,175
You're supposed to stay here.
Why are you walking forward?

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,650

[Original fairy Ha Soo Bin]
- She's was a junior in my class.

[Jae Suk is an alumnus of Soo Bin?]

105
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,300
Everyone went crazy for Soo Bin.

106
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,550
We sang 'Oh Happy Day' together.

107
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,225
Your story is too long.
Please go back.

108
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,500
[Please come back when it's your turn.]
- I am the big nose!

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,399
I wonder who Suk Jin's friend is.

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,650
Most of my friends stay home.

111
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,650
You'll be surprised, too.

112
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,399
- I will? I'm well dressed today.
- It doesn't even make sense.

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
Why did he dress so well?

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,850
Friend!

115
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,890
You're not going to believe
who it is.

116
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,125
[An old friend of Suk Jin...]

117
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,225
[The Empress of Rare Beauty,
Oh Hyun Kyung.]

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,799
How can they be friends?

119
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,200
[Their eyes are about to pop out.]

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,599

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,590
Are you close to Suk Jin?

123
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,025
She came to see Suk Jin.

124
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,190
We met 20 years ago.

125
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,370
I just started MC'ing and
she was really popular back then.

126
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,600
We were MC'ing together.

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,699
We were MC'ing together for a
show for about 6 months.

128
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,600
[There's another surprising relationship.]

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,999
Ji Soo and Hyun Kyung went to
same high school.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
- Oh, really?
- I was a freshman

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,199
- when she was in her last year.
[Hyun Kyung is two years older.]

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,950
She was really famous in Kye Won High,
as a goddess of beauty.

133
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,950
You went to Kye Won High?
No wonder!

134
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,520
What about our school?

135
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,570
We tried to hook up with Kye Won High,
but we always failed.

136
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,800
[We were different than the others
since high school.]

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,050
She's here as my friend, but she has
more acquaintances with the others.

138
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,525
I keep in contact with her.

139
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,499
[Even Kwang Soo knows her from filming
a sitcom together in the past.]

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,800
[It seems like most of them
know her better than Suk Jin.]

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
- Why do you keep covering my face?
- I don't have enough space.

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,800
- Welcome.
- It's nice to see you again.

143
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,320
Me? I don't have any friends
in the entertainment business.

144
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,170
He's well dressed, too.

145
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,100
- Friend!
- Who is it?

146
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:26,625
Who is Gary's friend?

152
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,350
- Is Miryo a friend of Gary's?
- No, she is younger.

153
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,770
We were in the group
'Honey Family' together.

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,175
I cast Miryo for the group.

155
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,299
I've known Miryo
since she was in high school.

156
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,525
She started rapping
when she was in high school.

157

She was the best rapper
amongst college students, too.

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,550
She belonged to the same agency
as me for a bit.

[Da Eun is giving off her fresh charm
in dramas and movies.]

166
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,700
She is pretty, too.

168
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,420
- Is she younger than you?

169
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,625

170
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,999
Did you guys have crush on
each other or something?

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,670
I wasn't interested in him,
but he said he was.

172
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,070
[She's dangerous.]

173
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,950
You confessed to me last time!

174
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,975
- Be quiet!
[You confessed to me last time!]

175
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,850
[Such a huge disclosure]

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,300
When did I confess to you?

177
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,550
[The Pandora of Da Eun]

178
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,299
- What a playboy!
- He's a wild animal!

179
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,620
Defendant Lee Kwang Soo.

180
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,300
Do you admit that you
have confessed to Shin Da Eun?

181
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,699
Please answer it quickly and go
back to your spot. One, two, three!

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,275
You do?

183
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,675
He never disappoints us.

184
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,499
[I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.]

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,299
It wasn't that kind of confession.

186
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,400
[The more he tries to explain,
the smaller he gets.]

187
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know, either.

188
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I wonder who Ha Ha's friend is?

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,750
I think it could be Lee Deok Hwa.

190
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,400
Call out your friend.

191
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,870
Friend!

192
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,800
Be careful, this is getting weird.

193
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,575
Don't panic and stay calm.

194
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:14,025
[Who is it?]

195
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,420
[The queen of talk shows,
Park Ji Yoon.]

196
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,825
She is indeed my friend.
She is a dear friend of mine.

197
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:28,599
Hello, dear friend of mine.

198
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,899
Why are you calling her like that
if she's your friend?

199
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,100
[Welcome, dear friend of mine.]

200
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
Dear friend of yours?

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,870
She gives me advice on parenting
and many other things.

202
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,400
We still talk formally.

203
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,625
- She's like a female warrior.
- Her nickname was General Shoulder.

204
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,090
- Why would you say that here?
- You look slimmer.

205
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,399
I have narrower shoulders
than before!

206
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,550
I could say things like this
because we are close.

207
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,550
You were MC'ing together
before, right?

208
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,599
- It was 'Star Golden Bell'.
- Isn't she more of your friend than Ha Ha's?

209
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,120
To be honest,
Ji Yoon and I are closer.

210
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,300
You should have called me,
Kwang Soo!

211
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,290
[Their relationships are all tangled.]

212
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,925
You will be starting the
Best Friends Race.

213
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,200
Did he say gold?

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,799
You will get seven suitcases.

215
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,299
One of the suitcases has a golden key

216
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,799
which is worth 1.5 million Won.

217
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,699
The last team that gets the suitcase
wins the race!

218
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,399
You will have to find the
suitcase yourself.

219
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,899
[Special bonus for the team who gets first.]
- Do they really give us the money?

220
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,225
Ji Soo just asked if she
can use all the money now?

221
00:12:56,225 --> 00:13:00,500
Her eyes sparkled
when she heard the word 'gold'.

222
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,599
[Pure and innocent Ji Soo
dropped her jaw in front of money.]

223
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,950
[The heart of Seoul - Yeouido]

224
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,100
[There are five mission sites in Yeouido.]

225
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:14,650
[Find clues about the
location of the suitcases!]

226
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,250
[Get the answer by clearing
the missions!]

227
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,099
[Which team will get the suitcase
with a golden key?]

228
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,790
The mission sites are...

229
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,499
They are all located in Yeouido.

230
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,890
The southern part of Seogang Bridge?

231
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,899
- It's going to be outside.
- It's going to be cold.

232
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,099
- It's a bridge and bridge is cold.
- Let's go to a warm place first.

233
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,399
- Coffee shop?
- Yes.

234
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,020
- Okay.
- Let's have some morning coffee there.

235
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,400
- And a bagel.
- Black coffee and a bagel?

236
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,975
- As usual.
- Since when? We like traditional breakfast.

237
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,799
- You mean blood sausage soup?
- Yes.

238
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,275
['Ji Sisters' are tomboyish
when it comes to eating.]

239
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:03,299
- How's your married life?
- It's nice. You should get married too.

240
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,999
I should.

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,599
You need to meet someone now.

242
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,099
I need to work.

243
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,199
You've been working for 20 years already.
What are you talking about?

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,799
I don't want to get married
because of my age.

245
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,599
- I'm telling you, you should hurry.
- I know I should.

246
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,899
I'll introduce you to a nice person.

247
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,199
That'll be nice.

248
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,290
- Where should we go? The snack bar?
- That's a good idea.

249
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,499
I hoped that you'd pick the
snack bar.

250
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,999
We always went to snack bars
when we were in school.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,090
More than half of my allowance was
spent at snack bars.

252
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,699
It was more than half of what we had.
And we didn't have much money.

253
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,999
Friend, I haven't been to the
Hongdae Area for a long time.

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,099
I don't go out that much.

255
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,499
- I heard you went back to school.
- That's right.

256
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,799
I just finished grad school, at this age.

257
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,499
- You graduated already?
- Yes. I wrote a thesis.

258
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,975
This reminds me of my college years.

259
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:12,899
- Did you know that I entered the contest?
- To be a comedian?

260
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,299
- You entered the college gag contest, too?
- Yes, but I failed.

261
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,099
Everyone in my class entered.

262
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,799
We wanted to get at least one job.

263
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,499
You shouldn't enter for gag contests.
We need to make living, too.

264
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,499
- It wouldn't haven been fair.
- I remember seeing your name on the list.

265
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,199
I thought I was going to get
a silver medal at least.

266
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,399
I couldn't believe when they called my
name for the participation award.

267
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,699
[20 years ago, he was full of confidence.]
- I was arrogant.

268
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,320
That experience made you
the person you are today.

269
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,350
The class of 1991 are all proud of you.

270
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,975
- We can't help it.
- Enough! That's too much.

271
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:00,099
[90's style Won Joon's
excessive complimenting.]

272
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,199
- You're the big star among the class 1991.
[The source of pride, Yoo Big Star]

273
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,325
[Each team is bonding while they're
heading to the mission site.]

274
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,999
- We're here.
- I think we came first.

275
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,775
[Suk Jin and Hyun Kyung arrived first]
- We came first!

276
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:28,200
Hello, can I have some
Kimbop please?

277
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Can you cut it quickly for me?

278
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,699
Are you hungry?

279
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,699
- We're here for a mission.
- But I'm hungry, too.

280
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,099
Sharing.

281
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,125
Enjoy lunch with your friend.
The keyword is sharing.

282
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,475
- What do you want to eat?
- Order anything you like.

283
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:48,050
- What do you like?
- I like rice cakes.

284
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,775
- Then let's order some rice cakes.
- She's very thoughtful.

285
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,770
That's all you want?

286
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,770
Order something else.

287
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,450
Thank you.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,299
- Can we just eat it?
- Just eat it?

289
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,999
The mission is to share it.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,950
[Hungry Hyun Kyung, takes a bite.]

291
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,950
Can we just eat it?

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,799
[No other rules were given.]

293
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,199
[Yoo Big Star and Won Joon arrive now.]

294
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,199
- Jae Suk!
- Hyun Kyung, you're here, too.

295
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,499
- Hello!
- I can feel it as soon as I step in.

296
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,550
- Feel what?
- This is awkward for both of you.

297
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,550
When I opened the door,
I could feel the awkwardness in the air.

298
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:38,890
- Did you feel that?
- Why are you sitting awkwardly, Hyun Kyung?

299
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,290
We're just busy eating.

300
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,250
Are they doing the mission now?

301
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,100
Enjoy lunch with your friend.
The keyword is sharing?

302
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,450
Kimbop, rice cakes,
Pork cutlet, dumplings, fish cakes

303
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,450
- How about fish cakes?
- Fish cakes, okay!

304
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,599
We want some fish cakes, please.

305
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,899
- Were you born in 1971?
- No, in 1970.

306
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,970
1970 is the year of the dog.

307
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,500
- Is yours the horse?
- Yes.

308
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,390
We're a good pair. Horses,
dogs, and tigers get along very well.

309
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,550
Why am I so happy to talk
about this?

310
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,399
They're so old.

311
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,520
Old people like to talk about
Chinese zodiac and compatibility.

312
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,825
Horses and dogs get along really well.
Were you born in the year of the rat?

313
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,499
- That's so cute.
- He looks like a rat.

314
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,599
We're the 70's people and
you're the 60's.

315
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,599
We remember the new village movement.
What about you?

316
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,475
Was it barley hump?

317
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:39,099
- We had new village movement.
- I was born in 1970.

318
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,299
[Jae Suk and Won Joon's menu]
- We shared the rice cakes.

319
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,999
- Don't share it with them.
- It doesn't have oden.

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,699
We call it fish cake these days.
It was called an oden back then?

321
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,999
I know retro style is trendy now

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,099
- but this is further back.
[It feels like ancient history.]

323
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,499
You know my last name is Oh.

324
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,899
I just love the word 'o'.

325
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,099
I think you've taken the Gwageo
Civil (in the Joseon era) exam.

326
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,199
[They have finished eating.]

327
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,299
The mission is to eat with your friend.

328
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,699
We'll give you a clue
when we see the correct action.

329
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,699
What is he talking about?
Correct action?

330
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,599
Then we need to act in a certain manner.

331
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,399
[I see!]
- So, the correct action means

332
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,099
we should do something
when we share the food.

333
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,099
Maybe it's like the pocky game?

334
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,499
She's enthusiastic.

No, I can't let you.

505
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,599
- I'm General Shoulder.
- Let's give it a try.

506
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,499
- Is this it?
[Piggyback of friendship]

507
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,099
Isn't this it?
I think it's the answer.

508
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,250
[The answer: Piggyback]

509
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,900
[Fantastic couple-
General Shoulder and Haroro]

510
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,899
[Clue for the suitcase]
- 'GONG'

511
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,899
- Just one letter for a clue?
- Let's try one more.

512
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,099
- Gong?
- We'll get one more letter

513
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,499
and guess the location.
It's difficult to solve it with one letter.

514
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,699
[Two teams have earned a letter each.]

515
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,300
[Who will find the suitcase first?]

516
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,090
No one is here yet, right?
We need to hurry up.

517
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,699
That's how it is.

518
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,075
I think it's here.

519
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,875
[Gary and Miryo's mission site-
the stationery store.]

520
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,490
Here's the mission.

521
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:22,599
Friendship test for finding the suitcase.

522
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,199
Pick it with your friend.
The keyword is 'To pick'.

523
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,500
I think we need to pick
the same thing, at the same time.

524
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,950
- Can we pick together?
- Take a look.

525
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,950
It says 'Pick it with your friend'?

526
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,399
What do you think it is?
[The store is a difficult spot.]

527
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,025
I don't know!

528
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,425
Do we need to pick something random?

529
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:43,400
- Since it's a friendship test...
- Could it be this?

530
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,599
- What is it?
- This coin machine.

531
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,299
- It's a coin machine.
- Maybe we'll get the same thing.

532
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,699
- It's been 30 years.
- How do we insert the coin?

533
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,699
One, two, three!

534
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,099
It came out.

535
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,599
- I've got marbles.
- What's this?

536
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,799
- Play again!
[Gary lost the draw.]

537
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,599
I'm just letting you know that the
producers don't really tell you anything.

538
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,899
- So, don't get upset.
- I see. We can't spend all the money.

539
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,499
- We shouldn't waste it.
- One, two, three!

540
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,199
[Turning and turning
and shaking]

541
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,099
[More turning]

542
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,399
Nothing comes out.

543
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,999
Is this how your life turns out?

544
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,099
What if we use up all the money here?

545
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,499
What is it?

546
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,599
What do we need to pick?

547
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,399
They never tell you what it is.
Have some candy.

548
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,199
Let's check the mission again.

549
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,999
- Pick it with your friend.
- Friendship test.

550

The keyword is 'to pick'.

551

What would it be?

552
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,999
Let's look for something with
the R stickers.

553
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,699
[Searching and more searching]

554
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,199
What would it be?

555
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,199
- Miryo, do you sense anything?
- Gary!

556
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,725
This is my first time on Running Man.

557
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,720
It feels like the first time for me, too.

558
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,999
Do you know anything about it?

559
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,399
The keyword is 'to pick'.

560

- It's underlined with a highlighter!
- That's it!

- That's right!
[Find the yellow highlighter!]

562
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,899
- Is this it?
- No, this isn't a yellow highlighter.

563
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,299
- Is there an R sticker?
- Should we pick it and check?

564
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,999
[Winner!]

565
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,899

You're smart!

566

- Do I look trustworthy?
- Yes, you are.

- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

- 'DO'?
- Is this the hint for the location?

See? We have five pieces.

575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,599
It's five.

576

So, let's eat one of each.

577
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,999
Let's feed each other.
Here, friend have some.

You can pay and leave. Ji Suk Jin
left without paying for his food.

- The snack bar.

This reminds me of the old days.

633
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,799

- Have you tried this before?
- She's on a roll.

When you do this...

637
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,699
You broke it.
You've failed!

- It was only a little piece.
- No, you failed!

639

it until we succeed.

- Where are you going, Ji Soo?
- I can't play this game with her!

651
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,499
She didn't even open it yet,
and she broke it.

652

- What are you doing, Ji Soo?
- This one is defected!

653

[Lick it first then pick it with a needle.]

654
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,599
- You guys, it looks dirty.
- It's better than staying in the cold.

655
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,775
It's better to be dirty and
leave sooner.

656
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:41,199
Do you think you can do it
in a cleaner way?

657
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,299
- She's licking it too.
[She lost to the coldness.]

658
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,599
- You're close, Won Joon.
- It's impossible to cut that one out.

659
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,199
What if I do it?

660
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,450
You can't do it!

661
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,450
If I do it, will you hook me up
with somebody?

662
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,999
- He wants to hook up at this age.
- Would you like to meet each other?

663
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,225
You can go to a cafe later.

664
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,490
- No, the snack bar.
- We've been there already.

No, why wouldn't I?

668
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,799
- She's very bold.
- I know right?

669
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,099
- She's not shy at all.
- She's not.

670

complete the Dalgona mission.]

673
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,450
Give it to Ji Soo.

674
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,970
Give it! Give it to her!

675
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,720
- I want to, but I licked it.
- It's fine, just give it.

676
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,000
- Give it to Ji Soo.
- Give it to me.

677
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,790
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

678
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,899
[90's style confession.]
- Yes, give it to her.

679
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,900
It's stuck!

680
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:18,490
You accepted it, right?

681
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,499
What are you doing?

682
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:24,100
Put it back together when
you meet later.

683
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:29,299
Put it back together later, okay?

684
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,599
You guys look cute together.

685
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,150
- I did it! I cut out a heart, too!
[Ji Soo succeeds right after.]

686
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,675
[Won Joon's enthusiastic applause.]
- She did it!

687
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,000
[Ji Hyo and Ji Soo complete the mission.]

688
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,050
Do you want it?

689
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,799
Please take it out from your heart.

690
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,100
[Won Joon and Ji Soo - In my heart]

691
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:02,677
[Location hint of the money bag.]

692
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:06,145
- Still, isn't this fun, Ji Soo?
- Yeah.

693
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:09,343
Honestly though, what do
you think of Kim Won Joon?

694
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:11,114
He's not your type?

695
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:17,436
Won Joon is so handsome and pretty.
I like everything about him.

696
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:19,955
I think he might be interested in you.

697
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,928
Ji Soo, how old are you?

698
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:23,778
I think we're the same age.

699
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:27,605
But Won Joon doesn't look his age.
Right?

700
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,828
<i>I can't always live with regret</i>

701
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:35,153
<i>I will give you everything</i>

702
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:39,069
<i>Must you always ignore me?</i>

703
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:42,469
<i>I can't do that...
[Ta-da.]</i>

704
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:46,335
<i>I can't always live with regret</i>

705
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,468
- The movements are so artistic.
- I know.

706
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:50,901
Won Joon, the movement are so artistic.

707
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:56,125
[Meanwhile, Suk Jin and Hyun Kyung
are having a blast taking pictures.]

708
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:00,550
- One, two, three.
[Ah,this pose?]

709
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,957
You're kind of heavy.

710
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,540
[Embarrassed.]

711
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:08,751
[Photo studio mission is
successfully completed.]

712
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:12,506
I knew it!
There has to be physical contact!

713
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,651
[Suk Jin and Hyun Kyung
also got a location hint.]

714
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:19,911
We're good together. I guess being
four years apart is a good match.

715
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,204
- I know.
- We're a good match for games, too.

716
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:25,098
- What zodiac sign is your wife?
- She's a tiger.

717
00:43:25,098 --> 00:43:28,394
See? Dog, horse, and tiger.

718
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:33,345
Yeah, but the tiger... I don't think
the tiger and horse are a good match.

719
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,982
No one's perfect.
Women and men are just different.

720
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:39,271
- That's the right answer.
- Women and men are just different.

721
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,909
Ah, I think I know what it is.

722
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:45,736
When friends eat together, they all check each
other out when there's only one piece left.

723
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:47,257
Or they fight over it.

724
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,780
I'll let you have the last piece since
you're older than me. Eat, Gary.

725
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,524
'Ah.' Eat it.

726
00:43:52,524 --> 00:43:54,748
<i>Gary, please come this way.</i>

727
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:57,816
[Fast Food Joint Mission Success!]

728
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:01,067
[It was that?]

729
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:06,606
[After all the twists and turns, Ha Ha
and Ji Yoon discover the highlighter.]

730
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:10,126
Hey, what do you think this is?

731
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:11,938
Gong. Do. Eui.

732
00:44:11,938 --> 00:44:15,351
Something, something, Gong.

733
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:18,590
Hey! It's Yeoido!

734
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,215
Yeoido... park!

735
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,495
- Let's go!
- Let's go, let's go!

736
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,203
Wow, this is just...

737
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:27,410
This is awesome, right?

738
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:33,149
Yeoido. Yeoido Park.
I'm 98% sure that's what it is.

739
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:35,391
It's Yeoido Park.
Do you think it would be Yeoido factory?

740
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:37,783
It's Yeoido, but...

741
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:39,150
- Yeoido park.
- Park!

742
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,748
- Yeoido park. Yeoido Park!
- You're right.

743
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,339
Yeoido park.

744
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,187
- I think Yeoido park is right.
- Really?

745
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:47,519
- 'Yeo.' What's next?
- There's 'Won'.

746
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,875
- 'Gong' from the photo studio.
- That's right.

747
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,327
It's Yeoido park.

748
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,619
The park is really big,
so there's a lot of places to hide.

749
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:56,934
They said it's hidden
somewhere in there, right?

750
00:44:58,805 --> 00:45:02,983
[Everyone is heading over to
Yeoido park around the same time.]

751
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:06,588
[Just who will be the first to arrive?]

752
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:08,793
[Yeoido Park.]

753
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,647
[In front of the octagon
pavilion at Yeoido park.]

754
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:13,691
[There are 7 bags in front of the pavilion!]
Ji Hyo and Ji soo might be there first!

755
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,881
Outrun them! Outrun them!

756
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,381
Where do we go?

757
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:20,183
- What's going on?
- Hurry up!

758
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:23,194
[All the teams have arrived at Yeoido Park.]

759
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:26,379
They're coming!

760
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:28,816
How can we be this slow?

761
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:31,851
Hello. Hello, hello.

762
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:35,584
- What did you eat today?
- We ate pork cutlets!

763
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,466
- You ate pork cutlets?
- I take it for you.

764
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:41,936
Let's take it together.

765
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:44,395
[Fan service in this urgent moment.]
- One...

766
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:48,313
One, two, three. One more time.

767
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:52,628
<i>[With the fans at Yeoido Park.]
- Someone just gave me their cell phone.</i>

768
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:57,487
[While Jae Suk and Won Joon are having
a fun time with their fans...]

769
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,810
- I see a pavilion.
- There's the bags!

770
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,769
- Where, where? Where?
- The bags are over there!

771
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:08,249
See? I told you it's here.

772
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,453
[Jong Kook and Kyung Min
are in 1st place!]

773
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:11,929
<i>Congratulations.</i>

774
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:16,034
- Well, it was pretty easy.
- This was the perfect mission for us.

775
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,705
<i>You guys came in first place.</i>

776
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:23,490
<i>We made it clear early on that we would give
a special benefit to the team that places first.</i>

777
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:31,614
<i>Among the seven bags there, we will tell
you which bag has the real gold key inside.</i>

778
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:34,876
- You're going to tell us? Really?
- Yes, for now.

779
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,605
<i>The gold bag is...</i>

780
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:40,308
<i>Ah, the real one... this is the real one.</i>

781
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:45,539
<i>You can take the real bag and
protect it to the very end.</i>

782
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:52,805
<i>Or you can leave it here on purpose
and take a different bag.</i>

783
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,993
We have to take advantage of this.

784
00:46:56,993 --> 00:47:00,987
The team that picks this bag is
going to think they were lucky.

785
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:05,197
We're the only ones that know that bag
is the real deal. Including that team.

786
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,157
- Right?
- Let's take number four.

787
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,257
- Since the numbers aren't good.
- Right, right.

788
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:12,347
If anything, they might think
that this is the bag of gold.

789
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:15,086
- We'll take number four.
- Okay.

790
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,280
- Okay.
- Work hard, everyone.

791
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,134
<i>We just have to play hard
to get it back now.</i>

792
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,331
[Time to reveal the
location of the real bag.]

793
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:28,740
- Number six.
- You guys picked number six.

794
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,520
You do it. I'm unlucky.

795
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,924
- Don't be like that.
- Seriously, you pick it.

796
00:47:33,924 --> 00:47:36,014
I'll give you some of my energy.
You pick it, Gary.

797
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:38,788
- I think it's this one.
- I think it's this one, too.

798
00:47:38,788 --> 00:47:41,032
- We'll take this one.
- Number two.

799
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:47,013
<i>Take a look and if there's real gold
inside, then you have the gold key.</i>

800
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:49,332
[Checking out the contents of the bag.]

801
00:47:52,278 --> 00:47:54,398
Is it real or fake? Is it real?

802
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:56,160
Hey, I think it's real.

803
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,409
I think it's real too, but we
don't know if it's fake or not.

804
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,546
Anyone can see this is real.

805
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,455
- This is real.
- Seriously?

806
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:07,492
Keep a straight face.
Don't make it obvious, okay?

807
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:10,143
[It's really obvious...]

808
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,434
Miryo, you have to keep
a straight face, okay?

809
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:14,307
- Okay.
- You have to keep a straight face.

810
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:16,971
People are going to come at us
with questions and suspicions.

811
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:19,477
- I'm about to smile right now.
- No, no, no.

812
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:21,549
Even if you deny it,
you're going to get caught.

813
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:24,391
But, aren't we all taking
the same bus together?

814
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:28,010
- I think so.
- We'll have to maintain our poker-face.

815
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,279
[They're all taking the same bus to
the final location of the mission.]

816
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:37,505
I'm not sure if you all know this, but there's a
lot of chemistry going on here. It's no joke.

817
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:39,613
- Between who?
- What chemistry?

818
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:43,192
I'm trying to get Won Joon
and Ji Soo to hook up.

819
00:48:43,192 --> 00:48:44,214
Really?

820
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:48,482
Ji Soo told me this morning
that a woman needs a man.

821
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:51,839
- Switch seats with her.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

822
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,188
- Sure.
- Change seats with her.

823
00:48:54,188 --> 00:48:56,919
When did I ever say that
a woman needs a man?

824
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:59,638
You guys look good together.

825
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:03,522
Kyung Min, how long have
you been married?

826
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:05,986
- Two and a half months.
- It's been two and half months

827
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:12,110
and he looks so happy.
Can we have a party after this is over?

828
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,416
[He's already dreaming of returning home?]

829
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,799
Because he's happy.

830
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:18,164
Because it's been a while since
I've met my awesome colleagues.

831
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,880
Don't worry, there is no party.

832
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:25,531
- He has to go home.
[Trying to maintain their poker-face.]

833
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:27,413
I didn't know variety shows were
so considerate. When did that start?

834
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:30,272
You should go home early if you're married.
It's the honeymoon stage.

835
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:33,841
Suk Jin, you said your wife still doesn't know
the exact time of when the recording ends.

836
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:36,015
Be quiet, it's a secret.

837
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,791
It's a secret. I'm recording
'Running Man' four days a week.

838
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:43,403
Four days.

839
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:46,088
[He cracks me up.]

840
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:48,441
[Gary is holding their
bag of gold tightly.]

841
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:51,540
Someone among here knows
where the gold key is.

842
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,122
- Exactly.
- Right?

843
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:56,103
There's usually a couple
that doesn't talk too much.

844
00:49:56,103 --> 00:49:58,280
Miryo couple!

845
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,819
- We're purposely...
- No. No.

846
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:02,076
Is it Jong Kook then?

847
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:04,661
[And so it goes back and
forth, very dangerously.]

848
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:07,679
[To the final location of the mission.]

849
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,862
- I think it's here.
[Arrived at the next mission location.]

850
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:17,023
[Entering as couples in a friendly manner.]

851
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:20,343
[What kind of mission will unfold here?]

852
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:26,371
What should we do? I think we pretty
much know which team has the key.

853
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:29,768
The people who are handling their
bag with care is the real one.

854
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:32,423
So much so, that they gave
the bag to me.

855
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:34,797
Seriously, I was carrying
it around for a while.

856
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:37,269
<i>- Everyone has their bags, right?
- Yes.</i>

857
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:41,570
<i>Starting now, I will explain
the traveling bag of gold race.</i>

858
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,767
- Traveling?
- Oh, it's traveling.

859
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:48,959
<i>Among the seven teams, only one team
has the bag with the real gold key.</i>

860
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:57,143
<i>Starting now, you can move the location
of the bag of gold through the mission.</i>

861
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,893
<i>For every mission that's
completed at this location</i>

862
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:07,247
<i>the winning team can move all
seven bags in one direction.</i>

863
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:13,826
<i>And you can check the contents of your bag
after all the bags have stopped moving.</i>

864
00:51:13,826 --> 00:51:15,002
<i>Okay.</i>

865
00:51:15,002 --> 00:51:18,641
- Look at their faces.
[Spaced out.]

866
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:23,579
I just hope it goes well for Ji Soo.

867
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,491
[Shy.]

868
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:28,102
They just happened to stand
next to each other.

869
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,399
[Me, too... chemistry...]

870
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:39,188
<i>Starting now, you have a time
limit of exactly three hours.</i>

871
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:41,259
<i>- Three hours?
- No way.</i>

872
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:45,076
<i>After three hours, no matter what the
situation, even in the middle of a mission.</i>

873
00:51:45,076 --> 00:51:50,355
<i>Each team must open the bag at that
time and the team that has the key, wins.</i>

874
00:51:51,594 --> 00:51:53,348
So, you only win when
the time limit expires.

875
00:51:53,348 --> 00:51:55,374
- Only when that time expires.
- Those are the rules.

876
00:51:57,303 --> 00:51:59,910
- You're calculating, so you must have it.
- Do you have the gold?

877
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,791
- I swear, it's not us.
- Do you know where it is?

878
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:03,325
- Really?
- Then why did you give it?

879
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:06,639
But your intention... I'm so
confused because of your behavior.

880
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:12,089
<i>- We'll go ahead and start the first mission.
- Shall we?</i>

881
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:14,030
<i>- You have to go find something first?
- Oh really?</i>

882
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,349
It's the part where I'm really bad.

883
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,176
- Is that so?
- I think I might have to pass on this one.

884
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,725
- You're not good at finding things.
- I'm really bad at finding things.

885
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:25,874
<i>Everyone will go up to the
second floor and get a towel.</i>

886
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:30,522
<i>Find a towel and come back here.
Now, ready! Start!</i>

887
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,740
Let's go!

888
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,163
[The clock is finally ticking.]

889
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:38,390
<i>- Move, move, move!
- Go, go!</i>

890
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,825
[Win the game and bring the bag of gold.]

891
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,638
[Until the game is over, the team that
has the gold key is the final winner.]

892
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:49,032
[The mission starts as soon as
they bring back the towel.]

893
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,168
- What do we need to find?
- Towel, towel!

894
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,133
[Goal: Two towels.]

895
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,451
This place is too big.

896
00:52:57,495 --> 00:53:00,591
[Have you been watching 'Running Man'?]
[Meticulously checking every drawer.]

897
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,653
What is it? Did you find one?

898
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:06,704
[Kwang Soo found one towel.]

899
00:53:07,629 --> 00:53:09,502
We just need to fine one more.
Just one more.

900
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:10,824
Hey!

901
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:13,001
[Two consecutive towels in a row!]
- Let's go, let's go!

902
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:15,304
[Now, they quickly head off
to the mission location.]

903
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:16,614
Run.

904
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:20,481
I found it! Hey, Won Joon!

905
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:25,311
- Won Joon! I found it! Come quickly!
- Jae Suk!

906
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:28,586
- Hurry up.
- As usual... Yoo-ames.

907
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:30,359
[Ji Yoon also finds two
in a matter of moments.]

908
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,947
Let's go, Dung Fly! I did it!

909
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,050
Awesome!

910
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,157
Where did you find it?

911
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,630
[Kwang Soo and Da Eun
arrive in first place.]

912
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,391
We found two towels.

913
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:43,299
[Quickly complete the mission
and make the gold bag yours!]

914
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:45,566
<i>Starting now, the mission
is an underwater relay.</i>

915
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:52,338
<i>While one person is underwater, the other
person will run up that escalator.</i>

916
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:54,610
<i>- Do you see the balloons over there?
- Yes.</i>

917
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:58,427
<i>There's masking tape on those balloons.
Just take off three.</i>

918
00:53:58,427 --> 00:54:00,582
<i>Take it off without popping it.</i>

919
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:04,242
<i>Then run down and as soon as you touch your
partner's back, the mission is complete.</i>

920
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,308
<i>Now, decide who is going to run and who
is going to go underwater. Quickly.</i>

921
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,414
You're good at finding things.
[Jae Suk and Won Joon arrives in 2nd place.]

922
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:12,246
- I'm usually bad at it.
- Oh, it started.

923
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:14,366
- Is there already a team down there?
- Yeah.

924
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:16,039
I'll go underwater.

925
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:18,810
Let me catch my breath first.

926
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,937
Da Eun, you're aggressive.

927
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,125
<i>- Ready... start!
- Run fast.</i>

928
00:54:25,913 --> 00:54:27,507
<i>Start!</i>

929
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:31,649
He is really slow.

930
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,831
He is really slow.

931
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:39,804
- Don't run like that, okay?
- You're not supposed to run like that.

932
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:42,903
- Seriously, what is that?
- I thought he'd be fast with those long legs.

933
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:46,273
- Are you okay?
- Da Eun, come up.

934
00:54:46,273 --> 00:54:48,150
- Yeah, you guys lost.
- Don't bother.

935
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,827
[Take off three tapes on the balloons.]

936
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:54,350
- You guys lost.
- It's over.

937
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,352
He's falling.

938
00:54:57,195 --> 00:55:00,706
[Already giving up before Kwang
Soo even takes all the tape off.]

939
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:04,006
[Kwang Soo and Da Eun fail.]
- It's over!

940
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:06,371
It's over!

941
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,919
Ah...

942
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:13,129
You should've held your
breath a little bit longer.

943
00:55:13,129 --> 00:55:14,522
Won Joon!

944
00:55:15,223 --> 00:55:17,015
See you soon.

945
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,392
This team could win.

946
00:55:18,392 --> 00:55:20,260
My lung capacity isn't all
that great right now.

947
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,488
Won Joon is at an advantage
since he's a singer.

948
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:24,604
Not really.

949
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:27,609
- Ready...
- I might be useless.

950
00:55:27,609 --> 00:55:29,499
- Fighting, Friend!
- Fighting!

951
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,552
Hold on, my nose is runny.

952
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:33,476
That's okay. It's water, anyway.

953
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,638
- Because I'm going to drink it, right?
- Yeah, it's okay.

954
00:55:36,555 --> 00:55:38,253
[Start.]

955
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,636
[Jae Suk runs up to the
2nd floor like an arrow.]

956
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,305
Jae Suk fell.

957
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:47,272
- Won Joon.
[Eyes wide open.]

958
00:55:47,913 --> 00:55:50,153
[Jae Suk has reached the second floor.]

959
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:53,128
- Won Joon.
- It's over.

960
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:55,655
[The spectators are doing their best
to distract him with their words.]

961
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:57,842
- Poor Jae Suk.
- What is he doing?

962
00:55:57,842 --> 00:55:59,913
He's still going up.

963
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:03,867
- Jae Suk! Jae Suk!
- Jae Suk!

964
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,029
<i>Jae Suk.</i>

965
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,170
What the...

966
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,141
He's still going up.

967
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,095
[A singer of 24 years and
insufficient lung capacity.]

968
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:16,120
[This is enough.]
- That was too short.

969
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,616
Jae Suk!

970
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:19,766
- What the...
[Happy.]

971
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,667
What were you doing?

972
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,446
[It's already over?]
- Hey!

973
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:28,162
[It just happened that way, my friend...]
- Jae Suk.

974
00:56:28,815 --> 00:56:31,148
What is up with him?

975
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:34,599
- Jae Suk, I'm sorry!
- That was the shortest time ever.

976
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,842
[Ji Hyo and Ji Soo.]

977
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,770
Are we the last ones?

978
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:46,927
Do me a favor and don't
talk to me at all.

979
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:48,477
- Okay.
- We understand.

980
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,770
Fighting.

981
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,398
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

982
00:56:52,398 --> 00:56:54,355
Fighting, Mother.

983
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:56,605
[Start.]

984
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:01,653
[A slight falter from Jae Suk's interference.]

985
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:04,172
[But he furiously runs up to the 2nd floor.]
- It's over, it's over.

986
00:57:05,976 --> 00:57:08,431
[An explosive speed that goes
beyond the length of your legs.]

987
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:10,434
- He's still fast.
- He's gotten better.

988
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:12,678
She's holding it in really well.

989
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:14,875
It's a difficult mission to complete.

990
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,123
- Good job.
- There goes another one.

991
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:23,629
He keeps popping them.

992
00:57:23,629 --> 00:57:26,738
[Someone might think that it was
a balloon popping mission...]

993
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:28,791
I think you should come
down for Ji Yoon's sake.

994
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,405
Ji Yoon is holding it in really well.

995
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,880
I guess having a sturdy upper body
really helps in holding your breath.

996
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,306
[Successfully takes off one tape.]

997
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,104
[Takes off another piece
of tape successfully.]

998
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:48,539
No, just one more!
Just one more! Hold on!

999
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:52,538
- My upper body feels stronger after talking.
- He's popping all the balloons.

1000
00:57:52,538 --> 00:57:56,493
- Just one more, just one more! Hold on!
- Hey!

1001
00:57:57,418 --> 00:57:59,833
Wow, you were in there
for a really long time!

1002
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,869
- I can't believe what I was hearing!
- You held it in for a really long time.

1003
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,729
[Ha Ha and Ji Yoon fail.]

1004
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:06,848
You held it in for a really long time.

1005
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:10,527
I can't believe what I was hearing!
He was popping all of them!

1006
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:12,269
You were underwater for
a really long time.

1007
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,581
[Embarrassed.]
- This was nothing!

1008
00:58:14,581 --> 00:58:15,927
She's a dolphin.

1009
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:18,228
Ji Yoon's practically a sea creature.

1010
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,765
Ji Yoon, I got it now. Seriously.

1011
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:22,795
[Why are you realizing that now?]

1012
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:24,543
- Anyone can win this.
- Let's finish this in a minute.

1013
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,341
- You better hurry up.
- I'll get it done in one minute.

1014
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:28,315
- This team has the best chance.
- Still.

1015
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:29,593
<i>Ready...</i>

1016
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:31,866
[Start.]

1017
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:34,224
[Blast off, Kyung Min.]

1018
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,774
It's fine as long as there's
no touching, right?

1019
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:40,038
Wow, he has a huge chin.

1020
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,266
- Ah, his eyes are closed.
- His eyes are closed. They're closed.

1021
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,731
There's a hole on his pants.

1022
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:51,848
[Distract me all you want because
it's not going to faze me.]

1023
00:58:51,848 --> 00:58:53,544
He's doing it, he's doing it!

1024
00:58:53,544 --> 00:58:55,897
[Kyung Min has reached the
2nd floor at that time.]

1025
00:58:56,645 --> 00:58:59,326
[Careful, careful.]

1026
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:01,003
[Successfully taken off one tape.]

1027
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,315
[Calmly takes off another one.]

1028
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:08,387
[Just one more tape to
complete the mission...]

1029
00:59:08,387 --> 00:59:11,656
[Kyung Min succeeds in one try.]
- Three!

1030
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,110
[A state of emergency.]
- Three!

1031
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,013
You have to come down.
Hey, what should we do?

1032
00:59:16,013 --> 00:59:17,891
It's over. Block him, block him.

1033
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:23,552
- Block him, block him.
- We can't let him touch his back.

1034
00:59:24,012 --> 00:59:26,807
[Sound attack.]

1035
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:30,342
- Don't let him touch his back.
- I know. We can't let him touch his back.

1036
00:59:30,342 --> 00:59:32,313
[Kyung Min has made his
way to the 1st floor.]

1037
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:35,239
- Don't let him touch his back.
[A human fortress.]

1038
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,924
- He has to three off.
- He did. He got three.

1039
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:42,858
[I'm here, Friend.]

1040
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:48,930
[Touch.]

1041
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,416
[Jong Kook and Kyung Min success.]
- It's over.

1042
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:54,836
Hey, you're pretty good!

1043
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:56,784
This is not fun. It really isn't.

1044
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:00,566
- You're pretty good at this.
- This is supposed to be a fun game?

1045
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:03,263
- What is this?
- You're a natural.

1046
01:00:03,263 --> 01:00:06,735
Shouldn't the actresses
get their face wet, too?

1047
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:11,607
Hyung Kyung and Ji Soo should get
a chance to dunk their faces in.

1048
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,816
I tried to pop some of them, but they just
came off. What am I supposed to do?

1049
01:00:14,816 --> 01:00:17,433
- Is it game over?
- I came out because of this.

1050
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:23,124
I could've shown you my bare face.

1051
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:25,861
I even brought a scrunchie with me,
so I could put my hair up.

1052
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:29,047
[Feeling sorry all of a sudden...]

1053
01:00:29,047 --> 01:00:31,421
You guys can really hold your breath.

1054
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:34,268
It's not over yet. We're not
playing any games right now.

1055
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:35,920
The clock keeps ticking.

1056
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,617
Please hurry.
We're running out of time.

1057
01:00:39,632 --> 01:00:42,236
Come on, they're helping us out.

1058
01:00:42,236 --> 01:00:45,192
Please hurry.

1059
01:00:47,551 --> 01:00:49,970
[Everything is a variable.]

1060
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,443
[Who has the bag with the gold key?]

1061
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:55,820
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1062
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,840
<i>This one is number five.</i>

1063
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,411
<i>As promised, Jong Kook and
Kyung Min may rotate the bags.</i>

1064
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,159
<i>At least one space and in
a clock-wise direction.</i>

1065
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,671
<i>And up to six spaces at most.</i>

1066
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:12,152
<i>The bags just have to
move no matter what.</i>

1067
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:14,073
<i>- At least one space, right?
- Yes.</i>

1068
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:17,635
It has to be at least one space.

1069
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:19,118
- One space.
- Just one space?

1070
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:22,293
[They already know where the
real bag of gold is at.]

1071
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:25,057
Hurry up, we don't have time.

1072
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:31,500
Because there's still a lot of time left,
we'll move it just one space over.

1073
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,589
Sounds good.

1074
01:01:34,616 --> 01:01:42,273
There's still a lot of time left, so having
the actual bag isn't all that great.

1075
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:49,153
[The bag is no longer in their possession, but
they know where the real bag of gold is at.]

1076
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:53,839
[The Gold Key.]

1077
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:01,141
I can't keep a straight face.

1078
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:05,105
[The relaxed look of the people who
know where the real bag of gold is.]

1079
01:02:05,105 --> 01:02:09,935
- There's not a single person you can trust.
- Did it come?

1080
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,290
- Did it come here?
- I don't know.

1081
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,703
- Really?
- I don't know.

1082
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:17,073
- Is it Gary?
- It's not me.

1083
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:20,789
This is getting really complicated.

1084
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:23,959
[Will Ji Hyo and Ji Soo be able to protect
the bag of gold to the very end?]

1085
01:02:30,053 --> 01:02:32,307
[There's still a lot of time left.]

1086
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:34,170
What are you doing?

1087
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,219
[Moving to the next location.]

1088
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,489
It's the karaoke room again.

1089
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:47,559
<i>How can we get 90 points
on this trampoline?</i>

1090
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:52,020
- Isn't this easy for you guys?
- No, not at all.

1091
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,346
- It's not?
- I have a sweet voice.

1092
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,241
- It won't make an impact.
- You have muscular vocal cords.

1093
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,234
- No, no.
- You're all muscle.

1094
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:03,451
[Putting his hopes on rocker, Kyung Min.]

1095
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:04,936
- What songs are there?
- Something simple.

1096
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:06,598
What songs are really simple to sing?

1097
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:08,945
- Something like 'The South-Bound Train.'
- You have to scream it.

1098
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,460
Sounds good.

1099
01:03:12,772 --> 01:03:14,992
Good, good, good.

1100
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:18,632
We'll go ahead and sing
'The South-Bound Train.'

1101
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:21,171
- We're going to sing that.
- That's our song!

1102
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:24,464
[First come, first serve.]
- We were practicing the choreography!

1103
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:28,318
We were practicing the choreography!

1104
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,067
[There's no such thing when
it comes the bag of gold!]

1105
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:34,079
You guys stole our song!

1106
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,515
'The South-Bound Train.'

1107
01:03:35,515 --> 01:03:36,914
Okay.

1108
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:39,022
[The South-Bound Train.]

1109
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:42,287
[A song that can give you a high score.
What will their score be?]

1110
01:03:42,287 --> 01:03:44,193
[Screaming and cheering!]

1111
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:51,483
[Totally in tune with one another.]

1112
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:54,243
- Fighting!
- Starting now!

1113
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:55,751
Okay! Fighting!

1114
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:58,181
<i>It's raining at the Honam station</i>

1115
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:01,719
<i>On the south-bound train</i>

1116
01:04:03,525 --> 01:04:06,567
[Taking turns singing a verse.]

1117
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,746
<i>The rain is falling down</i>

1118
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:15,001
<i>And my tears are falling down</i>

1119
01:04:16,161 --> 01:04:19,918
[The spectators automatically
sing along with them.]

1120
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:25,473
[Fun explosion.]

1121
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,249
[A party atmosphere in a
matter of moments.]

1122
01:04:30,249 --> 01:04:33,833
[Hyung Kyung, come over here!]

1123
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,027
[So excited.]

1124
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:44,280
[Singing loudly for 25 years of friendship.]

1125
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:46,443
Let's go!

1126
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:51,346
What is he doing?

1127
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,349
What the heck?

1128
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:57,836
[I just can't hold it in any longer.]

1129
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:03,547
[24 years since his debut and
he's ending it with a screech.]

1130
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:05,174
<i>Good job.</i>

1131
01:05:07,795 --> 01:05:11,370
[Unbelievable! They succeeded in one try!]
We did it!

1132
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,211
We did it!

1133
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:15,646
[The party atmosphere goes cold
after Jae Suk and Won Joon's win.]

1134
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:17,767
- What is this?
- It doesn't matter if you win.

1135
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,852
- We did it.
- We did it.

1136
01:05:19,852 --> 01:05:23,587
- You stole our song.
- We were going to sing that song.

1137
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:27,937
[Ceremony of happiness.]

1138
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,879
[I was wrong.]

1139
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:35,503
I was wrong!

1140
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:38,543
Bear it, my friend! Jae Suk!

1141
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:41,082
Seriously, that makes me mad.

1142
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,098
[Anyway, Jae Suk and Won Joon
won the second mission.]

1143
01:05:43,098 --> 01:05:45,447
- Thank you.
- Ah, what is this?

1144
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:47,149
<i>We did it.</i>

1145
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:49,451
[As the clock keeps ticking...]

1146
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,583
[The team that has the bag of
gold is going to drag time.]

1147
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,781
[And the team that wants
it is going to rush it.]

1148
01:05:54,677 --> 01:05:58,396
<i>Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Won Joon
won this second mission.</i>

1149
01:05:58,396 --> 01:06:03,064
<i>The bags must be moved at least one
space or up to six spaces if you want.</i>

1150
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:09,807
[The people who already know which is
the real gold bag are more nervous.]

1151
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:13,657
[Let's see here...]

1152
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:18,658
It's Kwang Soo. We have to check Kwang Soo
or it might be Ji Yoon and Ha Ha.

1153
01:06:18,658 --> 01:06:20,897
- Jae Suk, it's Kwang Soo.
- Jae Suk, there's no need for that.

1154
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:23,053
- It might be Suk Jin.
- Kwang Soo doesn't have it.

1155
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:24,354
Really?

1156
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:28,560
[Currently, Ji Hyo and Ji Soo have
possession of the real bag of gold.]

1157
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,181
Ji Hyo.

1158
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:35,390
- Do you have it?
- Ji Soo suddenly stopped talking.

1159
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,658
- Ji Soo, look at my eyes.
- I really don't have it.

1160
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:39,049
- Truly?
- We really don't have it.

1161
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:42,440
Then let's move it four spaces...
one, two, three, four, five.

1162
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,956
We'll move it along five spaces.
I want to check Ji Hyo's bag.

1163
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:49,585
- You check it, Mister.
- Mister?

1164
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,799
You check it, Mister.

1165
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,466
[The real bag of gold is now being
transferred to Jae Suk and Won Joon.]

1166
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:55,739
You can give that to me.

1167
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,370
Number three should be here.

1168
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,865
[The teams that know the location
of the real bag of gold:]

1169
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:04,029
[Ji Hyo and Ji Soo, Jong Kook
and Kyung Min, Gary and Miryo.]

1170
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:07,997
[Gold Key has been confirmed.]

1171
01:07:07,997 --> 01:07:09,932
[Trying hard to maintain a straight face.]

1172
01:07:10,538 --> 01:07:13,162
[We know that feeling.]

1173
01:07:17,457 --> 01:07:20,752
[The gazes of the wolves
aiming for the bag of gold.]

1174
01:07:20,752 --> 01:07:23,375
[Fine. If that's the case...]

1175
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:30,994
[Third Mission: Lung capacity battle.]

1176
01:07:30,994 --> 01:07:34,831
[In 30 seconds, the team that has the least
amount of balls in front of them wins.]

1177
01:07:36,054 --> 01:07:39,120
[Won Joon easily makes it
to the preliminaries.]

1178
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:42,596
[The semifinals.]
Jae Suk has none right now!

1179
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:45,919
[Jae Suk and Won Joon will
compete in the finals.]

1180
01:07:46,927 --> 01:07:50,010
[Final battle against Gary and Miryo.]

1181
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,583
[A perfect match.
They dominate Gary and Miryo.]

1182
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:55,628
[The reason they wanted to
be in first place is...]

1183
01:08:00,825 --> 01:08:03,360
[Time to move the bags.]

1184
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,342
We'll switch with number six.

1185
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:07,057
What number are they?

1186
01:08:09,913 --> 01:08:12,764
- You want to move it three spaces.
- Yes, three spaces.

1187
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:14,973
Three spaces.

1188
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:17,542
- Then this bag is going to Jong Kook.
- That's right.

1189
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,569
- That's coming to me?
- Yes.

1190
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:21,069
- Three spaces?
- Yes.

1191
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,140
That must be the bag of gold.

1192
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,527
- This is the gold.
- Really?

1193
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:27,144
Why are you giving it away then?

1194
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,871
It's a part of our plan.

1195
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:31,941
[Their biggest enemy is Kim Jong Kook.]

1196
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,929
[If Jong Kook and Kyung Min have the gold, then
whoever places first is going to take it away.]

1197
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:38,830
[And if by chance Jong Kook and Kyung Min
wins, they still have to move the bag along.]

1198
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,080
[This is the removal plan of the winners.]

1199
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,423
Jae Suk, I see what your
intentions are...

1200
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,369
I see what you're doing,
but it's a bad move.

1201
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:50,458
Well, that's just my style.

1202
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,752
- I'll tell you happy news later.
[Ji Yoon must leave due to her schedule.]

1203
01:09:01,752 --> 01:09:05,055
- Can you do it on your own?
- What choice do I have?

1204
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,658
- Fighting!
- Fighting, fighting.

1205
01:09:07,658 --> 01:09:10,832
- Show them what you got.
- Okay! I'm going!

1206
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:14,524
- Here, I'm going to give you my Iron Man ring.
- Okay, okay.

1207
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:16,418
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1208
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:21,725
[24 minutes left. Starting now,
it's a battle against time.]

1209
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:25,714
[Arrived at the next mission location.]
- We're here.

1210
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:30,137
[The first team to stick their hat on the
ceiling while jumping on an acupuncture pad wins.]

1211
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,504
<i>You have the edge since you're tall.</i>

1212
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:35,294
[The floor is completely covered
with acupuncture pads.]

1213
01:09:35,294 --> 01:09:36,857
- Did you see it?
- Huh?

1214
01:09:36,857 --> 01:09:38,688
You have to jump and stick
your hat on the ceiling.

1215
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:40,655
How is that even possible?

1216
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,213
What?

1217
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:44,845
[It's possible since it's a knitted hat.]
- Ah, I see.

1218
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:48,201
Da Eun, let's go right away.

1219
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:50,475
<i>- Hurry, hurry!
- You have to wear this...</i>

1220
01:09:54,895 --> 01:09:57,255
[Trying to receive a hat
is just as difficult.]

1221
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:01,694
Can we do a running leap
if jumping doesn't work?

1222
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:04,182
[A running leap?]

1223
01:10:07,752 --> 01:10:11,198
Do it from where you stand!
Don't run and jump!

1224
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:13,365
[That looks painful.]
- Ah, it hurts!

1225
01:10:17,956 --> 01:10:20,264
Hey, be careful.

1226
01:10:20,264 --> 01:10:22,654
What about me?
What should I do?

1227
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:24,582
- You're on your own.
- By myself?

1228
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:28,743
Sticking it on the ceiling is one
thing, it's the landing that hurts.

1229
01:10:28,743 --> 01:10:30,861
That's why they covered the
whole floor with this.

1230
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:35,003
It's not supposed to be
comfortable and easy.

1231
01:10:35,003 --> 01:10:37,098
One, two, three.

1232
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:39,750
- Awesome.
- She got it!

1233
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,620
I did it.

1234
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,925
[If Suk Jin is successful,
they win right away.]

1235
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:54,444
[The clogged blood vessels go 'boom!']

1236
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,798
[Hop.]

1237
01:10:57,798 --> 01:11:01,116
<i>- You did it, you did it!
- Hurry up, Gary!</i>

1238
01:11:01,116 --> 01:11:03,688
[They place first if Gary succeeds.]

1239
01:11:03,688 --> 01:11:06,253
[Too short.]

1240
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:11,122
[At that time, Won Joon
goes on top of the desk.]

1241
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:15,085
Please!

1242
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:21,520
[Success?]

1243
01:11:23,957 --> 01:11:26,201
This hurts!

1244
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:28,986
This is the only solution.

1245
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:32,659
[A strong and healthy cry is
heard throughout the room.]

1246
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:39,636
I have to do one more!

1247
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:41,421
Give me another one.

1248
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:45,661
- I'm scared!
- Fighting!

1249
01:11:49,343 --> 01:11:51,239
[A head butt to the ceiling.]

1250
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:54,747
[A bad side effect of being overzealous.]

1251
01:11:54,747 --> 01:11:57,177
- Did it stick?
- No, it didn't.

1252
01:11:57,177 --> 01:12:01,082
[Lost his mind. Lost his hat.]

1253
01:12:04,064 --> 01:12:06,957
[Jae Suk is successful!]

1254
01:12:09,976 --> 01:12:13,469
Oh, Mother! Oh my gosh!

1255
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:16,125
- I'm next.
- There's no such thing!

1256
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,373
There is no order.

1257
01:12:18,373 --> 01:12:21,016
[Complete chaos.]

1258
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:27,307
[15 minutes left. At this rate,
the whole game will be over.]

1259
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:30,853
[In that case, Jong Kook and Kyung
Min are the final winners.]

1260
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:36,147
[Kwang Soo succeeds!]

1261
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:43,963
[Whoever sticks their hat
to the ceiling first wins.]

1262
01:12:48,854 --> 01:12:52,637
- I got it!
- You did it! Good job!

1263
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:55,512
Good job, good job! We won!

1264
01:12:55,512 --> 01:12:58,266
- We did it.
- We did it, we did it.

1265
01:12:58,266 --> 01:13:02,095
- Let's move to the next game.
- Let's do the next game. Hurry!

1266
01:13:02,095 --> 01:13:05,538
[The people aiming for the bag of gold
need to play the next game quickly.]

1267
01:13:05,538 --> 01:13:07,872
Jae Suk, you have number six.
Do I have number four?

1268
01:13:08,691 --> 01:13:10,410
- Ha Ha, you're number four.
- What number did we have?

1269
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,637
- Let's hurry it up.
- Let's do the next game.

1270
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:16,479
[With the real bag in their possession,
Jong Gook and Kyung Min are very calm.]

1271
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:17,807
Let's move the bags.

1272
01:13:19,713 --> 01:13:22,411
Just move it one space over.

1273
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:24,733
- Let's move it.
- Just once space?

1274
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,287
Everybody already knows.
Go ahead and take number two.

1275
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:30,076
- One space over.
- Okay.

1276
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,214
Move it one space.

1277
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:35,504
From here on out, number two is
the same as carrying a knife.

1278
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,971
Just win the next mission then.

1279
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:40,124
It can end in the middle of the game, too.

1280
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:43,063
[Heading straight to the
next mission location.]

1281
01:13:43,775 --> 01:13:47,432
[The countdown to zero is approaching.]

1282
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:52,117
<i>- Look at the time!
- One person will go upstairs.</i>

1283
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:55,211
<i>- And that person will drop the hula hoop.
- Okay.</i>

1284
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:59,032
<i>You win if your partner catches 10
hoops with their neck in 30 seconds.</i>

1285
01:13:59,032 --> 01:14:01,375
<i>- Okay!
- You have 30 seconds!</i>

1286
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,736
<i>- One person go upstairs.
- Go!</i>

1287
01:14:02,736 --> 01:14:04,631
[Besides Suk Jin and Hyung Kyung,
everyone needs to hurry.]

1288
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:05,874
The way you throw it is really important.

1289
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,474
Da Eun, just drop from it there.
Da Eun!

1290
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:12,026
[Only 10 minutes left.]
Da Eun! Drop it!

1291
01:14:12,738 --> 01:14:15,079
[Now is the perfect time to win the mission
and get the bag in our possession!]

1292
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:17,342
Hurry!

1293
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,449
[They got one!]

1294
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:27,978
[Trying to stay calm in an urgent situation.]

1295
01:14:27,978 --> 01:14:29,606
Three!

1296
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,713
Is it over?

1297
01:14:34,322 --> 01:14:37,144
[The next team has to
hurry up and get ready.]

1298
01:14:41,378 --> 01:14:45,405
[Throwing it steadily and
accepting it calmly.]

1299
01:14:48,126 --> 01:14:50,544
There's only 8 minutes left.
We just have to drag it out.

1300
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:52,206
They could win here.

1301
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:57,239
[But...]

1302
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:00,604
[It looks pretty serious.]
- He's really calm and focused.

1303
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:03,611
How many do you have to catch?

1304
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:05,788
He looks like a seal right now.

1305
01:15:05,788 --> 01:15:10,873
[If they get one more from here...]

1306
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,639
[No...]

1307
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:25,904
- How many is it?
- Nine!

1308
01:15:27,157 --> 01:15:28,944
It would've been over if
you got the last one.

1309
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:30,903
Okay, okay, okay!

1310
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,848
Okay!

1311
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:37,499
[It's Jae Suk's and Won Joon's turn.]

1312
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:40,656
I can't see! Hey!

1313
01:15:41,523 --> 01:15:44,918
How am I supposed to catch this?
What are you doing?

1314
01:15:44,918 --> 01:15:47,314
<i>You two really suck.</i>

1315
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,635
- Catch it, friend!
- Hey!

1316
01:15:50,635 --> 01:15:52,324
You can do it!

1317
01:15:55,489 --> 01:15:57,393
Don't throw it upright!

1318
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:02,809
Okay, Hyun Kyung!

1319
01:16:06,725 --> 01:16:09,484
Take your time. Don't rush it.

1320
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:16,626
Whoa.

1321
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,929
[Their goal is to waste time, anyway.]

1322
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:24,887
Quickly, quickly.
What are you doing right now?

1323
01:16:25,783 --> 01:16:27,248
What is this?

1324
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,007
- Nice. Keep it going.
- What's with that look on your face?

1325
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:33,177
What is this?
What's with that look on your face?

1326
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:36,013
[Is he trying to catch it... or avoid it...]

1327
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:40,081
What... What are you doing?

1328
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,349
What are you doing?

1329
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:49,443
Just what was that?

1330
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,386
[In any case, 30 seconds
were successfully expended.]

1331
01:16:51,386 --> 01:16:53,392
<i>- Hyun Kyung!
- Yes?</i>

1332
01:16:53,392 --> 01:16:55,728
We're going to be winners
in three more minutes!

1333
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:58,283
Three minutes!
Look at the clock!

1334
01:16:58,283 --> 01:17:01,185
- Yoo Jae Suk, fighting!
- Throw it!

1335
01:17:03,234 --> 01:17:05,015
Five.

1336
01:17:05,015 --> 01:17:08,128
Six.

1337
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:12,296
- Yes!
- Suk Jin might win if we're not careful.

1338
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,105
We're about to win here.

1339
01:17:14,105 --> 01:17:16,166
Two minutes and twenty-two seconds!

1340
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,139
Here I go.

1341
01:17:20,885 --> 01:17:23,652
You have to do it quickly.

1342
01:17:24,816 --> 01:17:27,404
You have to look while
you're doing it!

1343
01:17:27,404 --> 01:17:29,480
- Okay, okay, okay.
- One!

1344
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,638
[Nervous.]

1345
01:17:32,638 --> 01:17:34,695
One minute and fifty-one seconds.

1346
01:17:35,741 --> 01:17:38,357
Okay, okay, okay!

1347
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:41,769
Why don't you just call it quits?

1348
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:44,834
Honestly, that might be better.

1349
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,314
Why are you quitting?

1350
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:50,186
Keep going. Why are you stopping?

1351
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:53,698
There's one minute left! One minute!

1352
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:56,800
Hyun Kyung, one minute!

1353
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,782
<i>Hurry, hurry! Hurry up!
Throw it quickly!</i>

1354
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:03,438
Throw it well!

1355
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:07,779
- Hey!
- We won! Hyun Kyung, come down!

1356
01:18:07,779 --> 01:18:09,992
Come down!
We're not going to do it.

1357
01:18:09,992 --> 01:18:12,356
We won, anyway.

1358
01:18:12,356 --> 01:18:14,809
Hey, hey, hey! Ah, this...

1359
01:18:14,809 --> 01:18:17,654
[However...]
- Jong Kook, get ready!

1360
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:18,976
There's 35 seconds left!

1361
01:18:18,976 --> 01:18:20,725
Jong Kook, get ready!

1362
01:18:22,914 --> 01:18:24,581
<i>- 31 seconds.
- Okay!</i>

1363
01:18:24,581 --> 01:18:25,920
Kwang Soo.

1364
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,697
This is it. This is your last chance.

1365
01:18:32,492 --> 01:18:34,932
[They miraculously catch every hoop.]

1366
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:38,580
Come out!

1367
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,526
- Throw it, throw it!
- Do all of it.

1368
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:50,079
Hey, 15 seconds! 14 seconds!

1369
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,826
Hyun Kyung!

1370
01:18:54,206 --> 01:18:57,011
Ji Soo, come quickly. Where is Hyun Kyung?
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1371
01:18:57,011 --> 01:18:58,608
Seven seconds!

1372
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:06,264
Kyung Min, we did it!
Just get this last one and we win!

1373
01:19:06,264 --> 01:19:09,766
We got all of it! We got all ten!

1374
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:12,226
We're done! We got all of it!

1375
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:15,035
- How many? How many?
- We got all ten of them!

1376
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:16,869
You went over three seconds.

1377
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:21,533
[Will it be the time limit or the
completed mission that comes first?]

1378
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:26,699
- Ten seconds left!
- This is the last one!

1379
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:32,307
[Jong Kook and Jong Min caught
nine with three seconds to go.]

1380
01:19:32,307 --> 01:19:35,118
[But before the tenth hoop came down...]

1381
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:40,360
[Time was already over.]

1382
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:46,197
Yeah!
[Suk Jin and Hyun Kyun are the victors!]

1383
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:50,659
The winners are...
Ji Suk Jin and Oh Hyun Kyung.

1384
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:01,108
[They fought to the very
end to gain victory.]

1385
01:20:01,108 --> 01:20:03,964
Since you won today,
please say a word or two.

1386
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:08,022
I had so much fun today and this
was such a stress reliever.

1387
01:20:08,022 --> 01:20:14,227
My daughter got a chance to see me have
fun and work hard with other people.

1388
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:16,348
It was so much fun!

1389
01:20:16,348 --> 01:20:18,449
You guys worked really hard today.

1390
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:22,128
The winner's today are Ji Suk Jin
and Oh Hyun Kyung!

1391
01:20:22,128 --> 01:20:24,292
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1392
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:27,845
[We hope everyone's
friendship never changes...]

1393
01:20:27,845 --> 01:20:30,790
If it's Super Junior, then
there's Siwon, Leeteuk...

1394
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,893
- Is he too fat?
- Ryeo Wook.

1395
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:38,103
[Idols that rarely go on variety
shows, come storming in.]

1396
01:20:38,103 --> 01:20:39,399
Hello, I'm Eric Nam!

1397
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:41,579
[I've been waiting for this day. You
will remember my name before I leave.]

1398
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:44,835
[But, can you do this?]

1399
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:48,286
[However, they do their
best and get it done.]

1400
01:20:48,286 --> 01:20:51,844
[A fierce battle is about
to unfold on Running Man.]

1401
01:20:51,844 --> 01:20:53,965
- You guys.
- Please help us.

1402
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:56,301
- I don't know when I'll see you guys again.
- I know.

1403
01:20:56,301 --> 01:20:58,159
- I had a great time.
- Sure.

1404
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,374
