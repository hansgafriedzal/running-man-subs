Chili oil won't mix with water.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,270
[That sounds relevant
but they're in a fog.]

172
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,900
You're the best!
Fighting!

173
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
It's the best 'fighting' ever.

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,800
Is that so?
Fighting!

175
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,550
[What should I do?]

176
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,900
Last time I saw EXID was...

177
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
- It was right before we debuted.
- That's right.

178
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,300
'Shinsadong Tiger' introduced you to me
saying that you would debut soon.

179
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,400
The group name is 'EXID'.
Hello! We're EXID!

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
That's right.

181
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,600
[She takes out something.]

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,725
[Is that a hair comb?]

183
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,500
I think it might take a while.

184
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,400
Go ahead.

185
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,650
- My hair is not fixed.
- Isn't it uncomfortable?

186
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,550
It is. I wouldn't do it if
I had a small forehead.

187
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,100
[She finally takes out a hair roller!]

188
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,700
The bangs stick flat on the
forehead if you don't do it.

189
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,550
- It'll be like this.
- Yes.

190
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,466
It looks like seaweed.

191
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,936
It's not easy to be in a girl group.

192
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,237
Seriously.

193
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,820
- It is boring...
- No, I'm fine.

194
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,970
Don't lie to me.
The weather is perfect for sleeping.

195
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,075
I'm fine.

196
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,950
[But her eye lids move up and down.]

197
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:47,775
[She's in a deep sleep.]

198
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,925
[Her neck is in 90 degrees angle.]

199
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:01,225
[That's right.
I'm on 'Running Man'.]

200
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,300
[She pretends nothing happened.]

201
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,010
I thought you were dead, Hani.

202
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,750
I try not to fall asleep,
so I spray this.

203
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,700
[She sprays breath freshener.]

204
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,775
[She opens the window and blows out.]

205
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:22,000
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,250
I just burped.

207
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,400
You're amazing!

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,325
[Hair roller + Sleeping + Burp]
[What an unaffected personality!]

209
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,800
[Field day for the freshmen.]

210
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,700
We're going to race.
We're the first team.

211
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,500
[The huge ad-hoc stadium awaits
Running Man]

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,020
[with hurdles, acupressure mats
and a special pull-up bar!]

213
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,050
[What will be the mission?]

214
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,250
- It's the 'Bungeoppang' team.
- Why?

215
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,675
('Bungeoppang' is a quiz show
with celebrities and their kids.)

216
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,600
This is the one-sided love team.

217
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,175
- Gary has a crush on her.
- She's very feminine.

218
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:09,100
I thought she might be a tomboy.

219
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,720
I asked why she likes snow,
and she said "It's high in scarcity."

220
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,020
She said that?

221
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,325
It's been 12 years since
I heard the word 'scarcity'.

222
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,700
I said, 'Are you good
at self-management?'

223
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,270
and she said, 'We need to
strengthen self growth.'

224
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,600
[So Min's character
is high in scarcity.]

225
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,300
[Kwang Soo and So Hee have arrived.]

226
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,736
- Did you talk a lot?
- Yes, we did.

227
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:37,100
- You're Kwang Soo's ideal type.
- Seriously?

228
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,970
[So Hee is Kwang Soo's ideal woman.]

229
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,670
It's true that I like...
[As usual, (only) Kwang Soo is truly...]

230
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,420
I think they're trying to
put us on the spot.

231
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,770
[Kwang Soo's heart is pounding.]

232
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,525
- Sister-in-law, he's real.
- He'll spend some money.

233
00:13:56,525 --> 00:14:00,528
- What are you talking about?
- Kwang Soo will go broke today.

234
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,800
I heard you're very smart.

235
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,020
She goes to KAIST.

236
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,700
She was accepted through
the rolling admission.

237
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,870
- Were you the first in the whole country?
- No. Not at all.

238
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,420
I went to a 'Gwa-go'
(a science high school).

239
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,200
You went to 'Gwa-geo'?
(civil exam in Joseon dynasty)

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,950
- Science high school.
- Oh, I thought it was the civil exam.

241
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,300
That makes her a person
from the Joseon era.

242
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
Seriously.

243
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,625
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun have arrived.]

244
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,775
- Didn't he nag a lot?
- No, he didn't.

245
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:36,300
No way.
That's not possible.

246
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,750
Wait 'til you start playing.

247
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,900
Yes, he will start nagging then.

248
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,075
He'll nag until the night comes
if you don't play well.

249
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:46,700
I must try very hard.

250
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,300
[Jae Suk and Hani have arrived.]

251
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,175
- What's wrong?
- You're very late.

252
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:56,570
Hani was dead for a while.

253
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,300
I told her to sleep
but she kept saying no.

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,700
Then she started humming.

255
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,300
[He wants to share
Hani's charm with everyone.]

256
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,200
I took the long way.
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,500
<i>We'll start the first game,
'Knight on a Horse'.</i>

258
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,050
<i>The couples will race on the
acupressure mat in their bare feet.</i>

259
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,200
<i>On the first stage, the guy runs
while carrying the girl.</i>

260
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,270
<i>Then they throw the girl
over the hurdle.</i>

261
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,170
<i>For the second stage, the guy
carries the girl on his back</i>

262
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,000
<i>and runs to the pull-up bar.
Then the girl should eat the biscuit.</i>

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,875
<i>After that is the last stage.</i>

264
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,800
<i>The guy can put the girl down on
the mat and then throws a ball up</i>

265
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,750
<i>they both turn around, hug
and catch the ball.</i>

266
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,300
<i>Keep in mind that there
are only four balls.</i>

267
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,275
<i>It's a foul if you use your hand.</i>

268
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:56,000
I love these kind of games.

269
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,500
I suffer from 'Cold Extremities'.
(Cold hands and feet)

270
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,820
[First time hearing 'Cold Extremities'
on Running Man.]

271
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,975
A 23 year old girl using
the word 'Cold Extremities'?

272
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:11,300
- She's 27.
- She's 27?

273
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,700
[First round, 'Knight on a Horse'.]

274
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,100
<i>- Fighting!
- The winner can take a break.</i>

275
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>Ready!</i>

276
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,470
- Will you be okay?
- I'll be okay.

277
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,250
<i>It's not that you're heavy.
Set!</i>

278
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,675
[Which couple will get through these
difficulties first and win?]

279
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,700
[The winner of this round
is the first place winner.]

280
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,650
[The guys are still smiling.]

281
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun
get to the hurdle.]

282
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:01,125
[They go through the hurdle at once.]

283
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,975
[Right after Jong Kook and Ji Hyun]

284
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:11,100
[Gary and So Min get through.]

285
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,150
Get on my back!

286
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,200
[On the other hand...]

287
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,925
[These freshmen haven't
stopped growing yet.]

288
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,475
[They must start from the beginning.]

289
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:36,125
[Jong Kook, Ji Hyun, Gary, and So Min
are on the acupressure mat.]

290
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,800
[They scream in a high pitch
with every step they take.]

291
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,500
[They get to the pull-up bar
around the same time.]

292
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,300
[Now it's the girl's turn
to eat the biscuit.]

293
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,975
[Their feet hurt and
they're getting tired.]

294
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,475
I ate it!

295
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,320
[Ji Hyun succeeds at once.]

296
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,700
[They get to the final spot.]

297
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,620
Hold me higher.

298
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,720
I still can't!

299
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,300
[They're the ones who still can't.]

300
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,000
[The three teams struggle
with the first stage.]

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,925
I can't throw you!

302
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:22,520
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo succeed.]

303
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,625
[They quickly run to the pull-up bar.]

304
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,950
- Just throw me!
- Okay!

305
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,000
[He succeeds at throwing.]

306
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,320
[They're showing off
pro-wrestling tricks.]

307
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,100
[They might end up
staying in the first zone.]

308
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Let's go!

309
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:52,500
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun take
the challenge at the final stage.]

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,500
[It's important to keep
in step with each other.]

311
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,575
[Don't just hug each other!]

312
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:06,400
Hold on a second.

313
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,770
- Did you eat it?
- It's done?

314
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,975
[Gary and So Min join the final stage.]

315
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:15,925
[They can win as soon as they
catch the ball.]

316
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,550
[Kwang Soo, So Hee, Ha Ha, and Ji Hyo
try eating the biscuit.]

317
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,300
[It's almost there...]

318
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,875
[They're still doing some pro-wrestling.]

319
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:33,400
[Your dad,
I mean... your brother is sorry.]

320
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:39,000
[Thanks to the mission,
they get free hugs.]

321
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,675
[My hands are slipping.]

322
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,750
- Did you eat it?
- Should I eat it all?

323
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,525
[Kwang Soo and So Hee
get to the final stage.]

324
00:19:56,275 --> 00:20:00,500
['Bungeoppang' couple didn't
get to see the biscuit yet.]

325
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,600
It's okay.
You never know.

326
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,720
[The three teams are
competing at the final stage.]

327
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,100
[They're in a hurry, but
the ball keeps bouncing.]

328
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:14,500
[It's the first time hugging
and getting stressed.]

329
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,600
[We just want to touch the ball.]

330
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,250
[They are the strong
winning candidates.]

331
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,550
[Gary and So Min calmly throw the ball]

332
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,275
[and keep their focus.]

333
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,075
- We did it!
- We did it!

334
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:34,250
[They succeed at catching the ball.]

335
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,070
[Gary and So Min couple,
the first winners.]

336
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,725
[The first winner gets a strong hint

00:43:37,706 --> 00:43:39,934
Okay, who's going to go next?

679
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:43,428
[- Suddenly starts to rub his eyes.
- Pretends to be doing something else.]

680
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:47,439
[Averts their eyes.]
[Avoids the team selection process.]

681
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:50,316
Do you see the depth
of water being 0.9 meter?

682
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:53,950
This is only going to be for the men.

683
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,377
[Automatically gets up.]

684
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:01,322
- No, you don't have to.
- No, let's just do it!

685
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:09,252
Do you see the waterslides over there?
We're going to see who gets there first.

686
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:11,701
Ready, set, go!

687
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:16,773
[Kkuk chooses to go the pool route...
and the rest goes up the stairs.]

688
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:21,960
[Quick footed Ha Ha
is the first to slide down.]

689
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:24,943
[But Giraffe stands in the way.]

690
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,100
[Eliminated Giraffe is determined
to take someone down with him.]

691
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:35,382
[Middle aged Big-nosed Brother's
final spurt, and he unexpectedly wins!]

692
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:37,679
- Who got here first?
- It was me!

693
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,303
Then I'll go up against Ji Suk Jin.

694
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:42,916
[Fooled you, didn't I?]

695
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:47,061
[So... this is what this place is like?]

696
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:52,682
[Eliminated Kwang Soo will choose
the next number of elimination.]

697
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:56,493
Wouldn't it be funny
if it was the first number we chose?]

698
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,729
[Which number did Kwang Soo choose?]

699
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:05,830
- I'm going to go for number one!
- Number one?

700
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,573
- Yes, number one.
- Number one?

701
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,741
- Why?
- What about number one?

702
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,383
- He doesn't know.
- I drew the number.

703
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:16,540
[But Suk Jin doesn't seem to care...]

704
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:25,039
What happened?
Did she get stabbed?

705
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,144
[Her explosive reaction.]

706
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:31,281
- Are you okay?
- There's a pattern to the act of crime.

707
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:33,853
I doubt it'll be number seven again.

708
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:35,642
Number seven!

709
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,402
- Send her flying into the water!
- She passes!

710
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,739
[Number seven is safe.]

711
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:45,631
[Kwang Soo is the only one who knows
what the elimination number is.]

712
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:47,643
[Shares the number with
his partner, So Hee.]

713
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:51,173
Which number?
Number eight.

714
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:56,352
[It seems as though Big-nose has
mastered the art of Chinese language.]

715
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,664
[Back to being Jae Suk and Hani's turn.]

716
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:12,689
I bet it's really nerve wrecking.

717
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,155
[And of all people, it's Jae Suk,
with the pea-sized heart.]

718
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:18,227
- Being eliminated is actually better.
- Number three!

719
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:19,614
No, number four.

720
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:22,252
[They're not on the same page at all...]

721
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:25,197
- Five!
- Four.

722
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,746
It would be really funny if I
were thrown into the water now.

723
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,943
Four!
[Follows Hani's wish, and chooses four.]

724
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:34,909
[The sword is in!]

725
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:38,323
[Hani selects very wisely,
and is deemed safe once again.]

726
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,776
How is the game lasting for so long?

727
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:48,083
- 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 are left.
- I think this is the moment.

728
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:50,650
- Ten!
- How about number ten?

729
00:46:50,651 --> 00:46:53,656
- I like it.
- What about number nine?

730
00:46:53,657 --> 00:46:56,623
[Number nine?]

731
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:01,241
- I'm going to go with number nine!
[Goes against Kwang Soo's advice.]

732
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:04,023
I don't trust you.
Number nine!

733
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,948
[How can this be?
Nine was the actual number!]

734
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:12,328
[Welcome to the pool.]

735
00:47:13,722 --> 00:47:17,708
I told you that it was number nine!
Why didn't you believe me?

736
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:21,482
[What have I done?]

737
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:26,274
- That's two wins in a row!
- Why don't you believe me?

738
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,241
[Kwang Soo selects number nine
as the next number of elimination.]

739
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:37,503
Yerin's face looks different now.

740
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:40,241
- Doesn't Yerin look different?

741
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:47,123
[She's definitely the free-spirited child
of the idol world.]

742
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,733
[Jae Suk and Hani maintain the win
with three teams still left remaining.]

743
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,213
- Let's play the noonchi game.
- What?

744
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:54,904
- One!
- Two!

745
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:59,097
[Kkuk is chosen as the next player
from having been too slow on his feet.]

746
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:02,796
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun
vs Jae Suk and Hani.]

747
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:06,164
[Being quick thinkers brings Gary
and Ha Ha to at least the third place.]

748
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:12,263
[Number three is the next
number of elimination.]

749
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,295
I'll let the other team go first.

750
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:17,526
Can I stab Yoo Jae Suk with this?

751
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:23,554
Two.

752
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:31,378
[A light start to the game-
Two is a safe number.]

753
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:34,310
Jae Suk's lasted long enough.

754
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,106
I bet Hani is a nervous wreck by now.

755
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,185
Ugh, I feel like I'm going to
die over here.

756
00:48:41,673 --> 00:48:45,001
- The suspense is killing me.
- Eight!

757
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:47,421
[Jae Suk and Hani chooses eight.]

758
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:49,964
[Eight is another safe number.]

759
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:54,320
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun continue
to avoid the elimination number.]

760
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,924
- One!
- Ten!

761
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:02,617
[Clears numbers one, and ten.]

762
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:04,488
[Both teams are doing a good job
of avoiding the elimination number.]

763
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:07,256
- They're both doing a great job.
- Yoo Jae Suk...

764
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:08,893
Three!

765
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,856
[At last, the elimination
number is selected!]

766
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:24,618
[A refreshing dunk in the water.]

767
00:49:25,686 --> 00:49:27,849
[Guaranteed at least a third place,
and moves onto the fourth round.]

768
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,086
[Thrown into the pool with her long
hair flowing in the air.]

769
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,172
[Wait, this picture is...]

770
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:37,313
[The young maiden ghost from
all the creepy legends!]

771
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,928
My lashes are still on.

772
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:43,737
[Happy that all her lashes are still on.]

773
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:46,949
[Gary and So Min vs Jong Kook and Ji Hyun.]

774
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,622
- It's okay.
- You choose the number, So Min.

775
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:51,832
- Just choose the first number for me.
- One.

776
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:55,246
- One!
- I hope someone gets eliminated right away.

777
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:56,648
[Shouts out the number with confidence.]

778
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:03,967
[Wait, did we seriously just win?]

779
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:08,035
Seriously?
Is this for real?

780
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:11,171
[Completely flabbergasted.]

781
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,592
[The elimination number
that had just been drawn.]

782
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:21,729
[Flying high into the air... and dunked.]

783
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:30,374
[This has to be a dream.]

784
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:33,645
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun are
easily moved up to the play-off round.]

785
00:50:36,522 --> 00:50:38,839
Stop spritzing!

786
00:50:39,764 --> 00:50:42,454
Are you running a pest control
inside your mouth or something?

787
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:46,634
[A total variety package.
Like peeling back an onion...]

788
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:50,650
[The final round-
Ha Ha and Ji Hyo vs Jong Kook and Ji Hyun.]

789
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:54,964
[Who will be the Greatest Love's
ultimate couple?]

790
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:59,296
[Which number will determine
the fate of the winning couple?]

791
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:02,813
- Which number should we go for, Ji Hyo?
- Let's just go with whatever.

792
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:06,845
- I'm really nervous right now.
- Then I'll just go in order.

793
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:10,966
Two!

794
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,139
[Selects number two.]

795
00:51:13,981 --> 00:51:16,554
[Will it be?]

796
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:21,678
[Ha Ha chooses a safe number.]

797
00:51:22,185 --> 00:51:24,470
[Even the crowd of onlookers
seem extremely nervous.]

798
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,655
[Whew... what a deep sigh of relief.]

799
00:51:27,904 --> 00:51:31,394
- I've never seen Ji Hyo so nervous.
- Should we go in order, too?

800
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:33,736
Or should we just go for it,
and choose number four?

801
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:38,570
- I really don't care.
- Okay, I got it.

802
00:51:38,882 --> 00:51:42,592
- You guys are looking very close.
- It's nice to see.

803
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:46,040
She's going to go for it,
and wants number four.

804
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,524
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun choose number four.]

805
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:50,524
[Number four has never been
the elimination number yet.]

806
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,856
[It should be okay, right?]

807
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:55,545
[You can trust me.]

808
00:51:58,204 --> 00:52:01,716
[Did Ji Hyun make the right selection?]

809
00:52:02,906 --> 00:52:05,198
[Game over-
Ji Hyun is thrown into the water.]

810
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:13,309
[Flying high.]

811
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,650
[Ji Hyun fails to select the right number.]

812
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:20,372
[It doesn't matter...
Flown high into the air.]

813
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,073
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo win the game!]

814
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:27,220
[The unarguable lady of luck!]

815
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:30,962
Let's not play these sort of
games anymore!

816
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,270
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun win
second place.]

817
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:36,819
[First place winners show off
their dance moves with Hani.]

818
00:52:41,712 --> 00:52:46,798
[Who cares what you look like?
You just won first place.]

819
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:54,940
[Token of Love- Time to make the exchange.]

820
00:52:54,941 --> 00:53:00,689
When we get to the end, we're going to
do an experiment with these six tokens.

821
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:06,322
The outcome of that experience is going to
determine who wins the entire race.

822
00:53:06,323 --> 00:53:08,084
[They all take their guesses on
what the experiment is going to be.]

823
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,973
Third place winners, step forward.

824
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:11,693
[Gary and So Min to make the
first exchange.]

825
00:53:11,694 --> 00:53:13,144
[Current- Chili oil.]

826
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:16,440
Let's swap this out for this one.

827
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:24,871
[Swaps out Kwang Soo and So Hee's
marbles for Ha Ha and Ji Hyo's water.]

828
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:29,205
[Their plan is to throw off Ha Ha and
Ji Hyo's chance at a win.]

829
00:53:30,997 --> 00:53:33,268
[Second place winners are given a hint,
and a chance to make an exchange.]

830
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:36,933
[A chance to ask one
'yes' or 'no' question.]

831
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:39,344
What is your question?

832
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:45,207
- Is it related to fire?
- The answer is...

833
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,945
No.

834
00:53:46,946 --> 00:53:49,335
[Q - Is it related to fire?
A- No.]

835
00:53:49,336 --> 00:53:51,276
We're going to swap it out like this.

836
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,297
[Jae Suk and Hani's candle
for Jong Kook and Ji Hyun's corn syrup.]

837
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:57,167
- Congratulations.
- This is the setup?

838
00:53:57,168 --> 00:54:01,601
Inside, you'll find your hint,
and a chance to make your exchange.

839
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:05,476
[Ask whatever question you'd like, and
we'll tell you one mission-related answer.]

840
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:08,971
Let's ask this one.
You said we're going to do an experiment?

841
00:54:09,274 --> 00:54:12,813
- What are we going to be experimenting?
- That's a very good question.

842
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,555
- Hurry up.
- No need to beat around the bush, right?

843
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:17,321
Here's your answer.

844
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:22,231
It's an experiment related to density.

845
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:28,122
Did you just use the word, density,
in front of Ji Hyo and I?

846
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:32,909
Isn't this what 'density' is?
Like texture of some sort?

847
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:37,648
[I think 'density' means...]

848
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:44,729
[Swaps out their marbles for
Jong Kook and Ji Hyun's candle.]

849
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,640
- I don't think that's right.
[They seem unsure of their exchange.]

850
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:51,735
No, you can't change your mind.
You must return to your spot.

851
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:07,788
Remember when the producers
explained the rules to us again?

852
00:55:07,789 --> 00:55:13,719
They said something about being in the
greatest spot means the greatest chances?

853
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,417
That's right!
You really are smart.

854
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:19,506
[So Hee guesses that 'Greatest Love'
is referring to being in the highest spot.]

855
00:55:19,507 --> 00:55:24,293
They even dyed the water in the shade
of blue to make it look like corn syrup.

856
00:55:24,294 --> 00:55:26,759
They put that dye in the water
on purpose.

857
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,398
So once everything is mixed together,
the one on the top is the winner.

858
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,403
With the difference in their density

859
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:36,340
the heaviest ones
are going to sink to the bottom.

860
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:37,947
[Density?
As in the clue that was just given out?]

861
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:39,901
From my knowledge,
I'm sure the candle will sink, too.

862
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:43,065
- But oil floats, right?
- Yes, oil floats.

863
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:48,043
- That's why it's the liquid candle.
- Yes, you're right!

864
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,699
[Kwang Soo and So Hee guess the greatest
token of love to be the candle.]

865
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,113
[Did these two manage to guess correctly?]

866
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:55,832
Hani, I think I've figured it out.
I think it's the boiling point.

867
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,458
Isn't it usually 150 degrees?

868
00:55:57,459 --> 00:56:02,233
[What's the 'boiling point'?
Is it something you eat?]

869
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:08,657
I was on a one meal a day diet.

870
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:14,635
- But you've been eating nonstop.
- There's usually one free day.

871
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:17,293
I really do think that it's
related to the boiling point.

872
00:56:19,992 --> 00:56:24,435
- What happens when you win?
- They gave out a diamond ring once.

873
00:56:24,436 --> 00:56:28,523
[How many baked goods
can I buy with a diamond ring?]

874
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:36,325
[They finally arrive at
the final mission location.]

875
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:38,909
[An army of teddy bears?]

876
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:42,347
- I'd suggest that you run over here.
- Is it a first-come-first-serve basis?

877
00:56:42,348 --> 00:56:46,505
[The quicker they arrive, the better off
they'll be for the final mission.]

878
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:49,965
The third and the final mission
is 'The Love Confession Stair Quiz.'

879
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:52,378
[Final mission of the day-
The Love Confession Stair Quiz.]

880
00:56:52,379 --> 00:57:00,767
[A meeting of a love confession and quiz
for this group of newbies.]

881
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,366
[Stairway of Suffering
at 'D' University in Seoul.]

882
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,265
- See the 'R' flag on top of the stairs?
- Yes.

883
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:09,646
The girls will go and stand by the flag.
You may go up there now.

884
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:13,192
[The girls will go and wait by the flag
at the top of the stairway.]

885
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:22,254
[Just what is the mission about for
us to start suffering like this already?]

886
00:57:23,058 --> 00:57:26,047
Here are the rules.
You will be given a question down here.

887
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:29,247
You will run up the steps
with one of the stuffed teddy bears.

888
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:32,344
Remember the question that I've posed,
and ask your partner waiting for you up top.

889
00:57:32,345 --> 00:57:35,747
- The first team to correctly answer...
- It's just one?

890
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:38,333
- You just need to answer one question.
- We can do this.

891
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:40,992
[Answer the question incorrectly,
and you must run back down the steps.]

892
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,736
Look, it's a teddy bear!
It's so huge!

893
00:57:45,572 --> 00:57:49,598
It's totally cute.
The poor teddy bears are getting wet.

894
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,869
[The girls are excited at the prospect
of getting a teddy bear.]

895
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:58,094
- The teddy bears got soaked in the rain.
- They're really heavy!

896
00:57:58,095 --> 00:58:00,897
Why is this teddy bear so heavy?

897
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:06,870
The song, 'Wish List' by Byun Jin Sup,
which was very popular back in the 80's...

898
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:14,758
- Fill in the blank in these lyrics.
- I totally know this one!

899
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,601
- Go!
- But Yerin was born in 1996.

900
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:22,199

He's carrying the teddy bear up here.
So cute!

904
00:58:35,363 --> 00:58:37,142
[The girls are eagerly waiting
for their own teddy bear.]

905
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:41,434
Yerin!

906
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,733
If you get this question wrong,
then I have to go back down there.

907
00:58:43,734 --> 00:58:46,250
Really?
Then I'll get it right.

908
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,367
- Listen carefully, okay?
- A traditionally played marble game...

909
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:55,142
It's a marble slap game, right?
But it's also referred to as, __ game.

910
00:58:55,143 --> 00:58:59,637
Which means, a sound made by a half empty
glass bottle. What is this other name?

911
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:01,141
Go.

912
00:59:03,591 --> 00:59:05,899
Here he comes.

913
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:15,385

What are you talking about?
How can you match into jeans?

00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:47,118
[Correct answer- Vision.]
- Did she say, 'Matches into the jeans'?

924
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,336
- You think the song is about a dry cleaner?
- I'm so sorry!

925
00:59:51,371 --> 00:59:55,335
Do you work in a dressmaker shop?
Why would you match into some jeans?

926
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:59,031
[He must now go back down the stairs to
receive a new question to ask his partner.]

927
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:01,277
- I feel so bad!
- You can't do this to me!

928
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:05,981
[The bear must also be taken back down.]
- This is so heavy!

[So Min is sent up the stairs
as soon as she arrives.]

[What is the question
that will be posed of Gary?]

933
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:26,323
In the popular letter grading system
for school academic grade standing

934
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:28,926
'Ga' represents the lowest
letter grade.

935
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,846
What do you think that represents?
Go!

936
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:35,302
How are we supposed to know
what that letter means?

937
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,468
Doesn't the 'Ga' means
that we're already ruined?

938
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:44,955
Fighting!

939
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:46,791
So Min!

940

nothing but endless suffering for me?

- Fighting!

942
01:00:52,747 --> 01:00:55,610
[Please... let's just win this right now.]
- You need to answer this correctly.

943
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,947
- Should I give you your question?
- No, you can give it to me in a little bit.

944
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:04,010
- What's 'Fidget slap'?
- What did you say?

945
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:05,857
- Fidget slap.
- Fidget slap?

946
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:07,753
Was she close?

947
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:12,343
You know the letter grading system that's
used by schools to grade your academics?

948
01:01:12,713 --> 01:01:15,383
But that's not the question.

949
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:19,751
But in that grading system, 'Ga'
represents the lowest grade, right?

950
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:22,689
- So what does 'Ga' mean?
- What the heck is this!

951
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,689
- I think it's a Chinese character.
- What does it mean?

952
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:30,505
- 'Su' would mean, minus...
- Yes, it's along those same lines!

953
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,099
It's the lowest?
Wait a minute...

954
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:36,008
Is it like telling you to go away?

955
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:39,593
Like telling you to go away with
your bad grades or something?

956
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,375
Or does it mean that
you're on the brink of failing?

957
01:01:44,186 --> 01:01:46,206
[Answer- Shows potential]

958
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:50,013

[Go away back down to the bottom,
and get yourself another question.]

960

You're making this love confession
way too hard!

961
01:01:58,397 --> 01:02:02,119
Can't you just allow us to
love each other?

962
01:02:02,465 --> 01:02:05,764
The bears are getting heavier by the minute
because they're getting wet from the rain.

963
01:02:05,812 --> 01:02:10,337
- I know, it's getting really soggy.
- It's getting wet and soggy in the rain.

964
01:02:10,871 --> 01:02:16,447
- They've got the bear again.
- I bet they're really cold.

965
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:21,689
The Greek mathematician, Archimedes,
figured out the principle of buoyancy

966
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,066
while bathing and shouted out these words
in excitement. What did he shout out?

967
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:27,941
'Tears of the Moon', which is a type of jewel
that Cleopatra mixed into vinegar

968

to drink for beautifying effects...
What is the name of this jewel?

969
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,656
He looks so defeated already.

970
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:42,101
- He's deflated of his energy.
- The ladies can go up right now.

971
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:45,591
- You can do this, right?
- Okay, let's get this done.

972
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:47,410
- The Greek mathematician, Archimedes...
- Yes?

973
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:51,982
He became so excited when he figured out
the principle of buoyancy while bathing

974
01:02:51,983 --> 01:02:54,480
- that he shouted out these words...
- Eureka!

975
01:02:57,499 --> 01:02:59,248
[No way!]

976
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:02,078
[But I just got here!]

977
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:09,973
[Is it right or wrong?]

978
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:12,390
- Can you ring that again?
- Okay, let me ring that again.

979
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:16,892
Come on, do it right!

980
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:21,263
[Correct answer- Eureka]

981
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:25,442
- My team was the first to get here.
- Who wouldn't know the answer to that?

982
01:03:25,443 --> 01:03:27,248
Who else would know it?

983
01:03:27,249 --> 01:03:30,555
- I just said it in the shower this morning.
- What a laugh.

984
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,104
[Gary and So Min win first place.]

985
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:37,494
In the worldwide popular novel series,
'Harry Potter'...

986
01:03:37,495 --> 01:03:42,845
the usage of this magical tool would
determine the students' dormitories.

987
01:03:42,846 --> 01:03:46,395
- What is this the book is referring to?
- I don't know this either.

988
01:03:46,396 --> 01:03:49,496
Usage of this magical tool to determine
the students' dormitories?

What is this magical tool?

990
01:03:54,404 --> 01:03:57,056
The magical tool...

[The bear is so heavy,
and my knees are starting to hurt...]

992
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,181
- Yerin, we have to get this right.
- You can do this!

993
01:04:04,597 --> 01:04:06,804
We have to get this right.

994

I feel so bad.

995
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:12,587
Cleopatra mixed this into vinegar
and drank it to keep herself beautiful.

996

What is this thing that was also called
'Tears of the Moon'?

01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:23,526
- What could it be? I have no idea.
[Answer - Pearls]

999
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,331
Why are you struggling
so much with it?

1000
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:29,028
[The joy of having come in at first place.]

1001
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:32,642
- Yerin...
- Is it an easy question?

1002
01:04:32,643 --> 01:04:36,537
- You've seen Harry Potter, haven't you?
- No, I haven't.

1003
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:41,294
[Thus, the second attempt is also a failure.
Answer- Sorting Hat]

1004
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:45,605
A couple that's constantly stuck to each
other is said to look like a pair of these.

1005
01:04:45,826 --> 01:04:49,628
In Spanish, it means, 'La cucaracha'.
What is it referring to?

1006
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,735
Cockroach.

1007
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:58,905
[No way...
Could that be the right answer?]

1008
01:05:00,072 --> 01:05:02,384
- Seriously?
- Yes, it's cockroaches.

1009
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:05,463
Don't act like you're smart.
You've gotten all the previous ones wrong.

1010
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:08,769
- Seriously?
- You kept asking me all the tough questions.

1011
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,255
Yes, 'La cucaracha' means, 'The cockroach'.

1012
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:13,070
- Yes, that's what it means.
- Yes, that's correct.

1013
01:05:13,071 --> 01:05:15,395
- How did you know that?
- You didn't know?

1014
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:18,444
'Cockroaches, cockroaches...
the name is so beautiful.'

1015
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:20,156
Is that what it really means?

1016
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:25,000
- We came in at second place!
[Kwang Soo and So Hee in second place.]

1017
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:30,197
This place was named after the best
strategist during the Joseon era

1018
01:05:30,198 --> 01:05:32,807
- who was also infamous for his virility.
- I don't even understand the question.

1019
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:36,128
What is the name of this place,
which is popular amongst the young people?

1020
01:05:36,129 --> 01:05:38,002
Jung-ja-Dong.

1021
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:41,561
[Would Ji Hyo know this answer?]

1022
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:48,054
'Wile staring into my silent eyes,
she matches my __.'

1023
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:51,751
- Is it two letters?
- Circle lenses!

1024
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:53,298
[Correct answer- Vision.]

1025
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:58,971
- 'While staring into my silent eyes...'
- She stares into the whites of my eyes.

1026
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:03,439
- What do you mean, whites of my eyes?
- What else would she look into?

1027
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:06,855
[My woman... she stares
into the whites of my eyes.]

1028
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:13,253
- My face!
- My... eyes? I'm sorry.

1029
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:17,755
I knew you'd be like this from the moment
I heard you snoring in your sleep.

1030
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:22,767
[No need to go too far.
Just go back to the base of the stairs.]

1031
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,496
- Someone already got second place, right?
- Yeah.

1032
01:06:25,497 --> 01:06:27,250
- Who was it?
- Kwang Soo.

1033
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:33,301
[Must come in at least third place
in order to gain some sort of a hint.]

1034
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:38,586
This part of the body is thrusted out in
greeting when greeting someone in Tibet.

1035
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:40,627
Which body part are they referring to?

1036
01:06:45,863 --> 01:06:49,070
This is like army training all over again.

1037
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,508
- When you drink...
- It's about drinking again?

1038
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:58,138
- Yes, but in Joseon era...
- Joseon era again?

1039
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,813
No, it's not about the Joseon era.

1040
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:06,344
We have to correctly guess this hotspot
that the young people in Joseon would go to.

1041
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:09,000
- Is it related to the past?
- I think so.

1042
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:11,981
But you need to tell me
the name of the place!

1043
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:15,688
- You have to guess what it is, you fool!
- That's way too easy!

1044
01:07:16,014 --> 01:07:20,971
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Ahpgujung-do!

1045
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:24,383
[Correct answer- Ahpgujung]

1046
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:27,852
[Seriously?
That's the correct answer?]

1047
01:07:27,853 --> 01:07:30,136
[This is going to be game over.]

1048
01:07:30,938 --> 01:07:33,446
[You heard the answer, right?]

1049
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,551
[Seeing the expression on everyone's
faces, the answer must be...]

1050
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,210
- Myeongwolgwan!
- What!

1051
01:07:41,286 --> 01:07:43,784
Ji Hyo, are you kidding right now?

1052
01:07:43,785 --> 01:07:45,584
['Myeongwolgwan' is the hotspot
for the young people?]

1053
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:47,903
- That's a barbeque place.
- Forget it.

1054
01:07:48,855 --> 01:07:51,102
[Ten years shaved off of his life.]

1055
01:07:56,127 --> 01:08:02,262
People in Tibet thrust out this part of
their body when greeting someone.

1056
01:08:02,263 --> 01:08:03,777
- Tibet?
- Tibet.

1057
01:08:03,778 --> 01:08:06,080
- I think I know.
- People in Tibet, okay?

1058
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:08,652
- I know this. This is too easy.
- This is the people in Tibet.

1059
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:10,581
I think 'Thrust out' is the hint.

1060
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:17,016
[Think about what you can thrust out.]

1061
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:24,008
The tongue?

1062
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,446
Come on, let's hurry.

1063
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:30,506
[Correct answer- Tongue.]

1064
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:32,784
Who knew that would be the answer?

1065
01:08:32,785 --> 01:08:34,691
We got it!

1066
01:08:34,692 --> 01:08:36,811
We got it!

1067
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,859
[Jae Suk and Hani come in
at third place.]

1068
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:43,785
[The final mission is now over.]

1069
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,278
- Who knew that would be the right answer?
- Is it over?

1070
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:53,271
[It can't be over, can it?]

1071
01:08:53,272 --> 01:08:58,046
[But we were the first ones to get here...]
- Yerin, is the game over?

1072
01:08:58,047 --> 01:09:02,879
[The early bird...
is the first to get tired out?]

1073
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,985
- Is it all seriously over?
- We've got nothing.

1074
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:09,613
We have to continue to
remain clueless in the race.

1075
01:09:12,973 --> 01:09:17,154
[The only thing that remains is the
final chance to make an exchange.]

1076
01:09:17,155 --> 01:09:21,012
[Which of these tokens will
indicate who holds the greatest love?]

1077
01:09:21,013 --> 01:09:23,639
Wow, look at all this fog.

1078
01:09:24,506 --> 01:09:28,564
Yerin, this is called, smoke.
It's not fog.

1079
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:33,975
- Ugh, I'm so disappointed.
- I really had higher hopes for today.

1080
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:38,879
[Token of love's current standing.]

1081
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,105
Yoo Jae Suk, who came in at third place,
please step forward.

1082
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,950
[They can make the exchange
without being given any hints.]

1083
01:09:44,951 --> 01:09:48,398
The previous first place winner...
had the candle, right?

1084
01:09:50,422 --> 01:09:52,956
<i>Don't you think that it has
something to do with the boiling point?</i>

1085
01:09:55,142 --> 01:09:58,022
<i>Doesn't it take a long time for
the oil to reach its boiling point?</i>

1086
01:09:58,023 --> 01:10:02,028
<i>- Yes, it does.
- I bet it has to do with the boiling point.</i>

1087
01:10:02,029 --> 01:10:04,600
[Guessing that it has something to do with
the boiling point of the chili oil.]

1088
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:07,841
<i>The candle would be the first to melt.
It can't be the candle.</i>

1089
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,822
- I think it's either this one or that one.
- It's one or the other.

1090
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:15,088
- It has to be one or the other.
- Want to go with our first choice?

1091
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:20,293
To be honest, I'm not really sure.

1092
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:24,410
[Jae Suk and Hani choose the chili oil.]

1093
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:27,368
Lee Kwang Soo and partner,
take the card and make your exchange.

1094
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,672
It must be so nice to be able to
earn a hint, Kwang Soo.

1095
01:10:31,028 --> 01:10:34,553
Don't let anyone see the card.
No, You have to stand behind the display.

1096
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:40,822
No, stand in front.
No, hold it over like this.

1097
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:45,003
[What's wrong with you?
Haven't you ever seen a hint before?]

1098
01:10:45,004 --> 01:10:47,234
- This is the first hint I've earned.
- Really?

1099
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,453
Lee Kwang Soo, isn't Yoon So Hee
going to do it by herself anyway?

1100
01:10:52,675 --> 01:10:55,444
- How can you even say that?
- You just look so clueless.

1101
01:10:55,445 --> 01:10:59,151
How can you even say that?
We're figuring this out together.

1102
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:00,503
We're in on this together.

1103
01:11:00,504 --> 01:11:04,054
There was going to be a love connection,
but I see now that she's refusing it.

1104
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,449
There is an underlying love connection.

1105
01:11:08,595 --> 01:11:10,872
[What hint did they receive?]

1106
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:16,061
[Lee Kwang Soo, and Soo Hee are currently
in one of the top three standing.]

1107
01:11:16,062 --> 01:11:19,479
Then what we have...
is one of the top three contenders?

1108
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,797
[Water is one of the top three contenders?]

1109
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:24,234
<i>They purposely dyed the water blue to
differentiate from the corn syrup.</i>

1110
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:27,657
[The water was purposely dyed blue to
tell it apart from the corn syrup?]

1111
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,862
[Separating the soluble, and the
one that floats on top is the winner?]

1112
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:37,493
[So Hee guesses that the Greatest Love
is related to the density of the soluble?]

1113
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,818
<i>Oil floats, doesn't it?</i>

1114
01:11:40,785 --> 01:11:44,742
- Jae Suk just swapped his out.
- But that's what we want, too, isn't it?

1115
01:11:44,743 --> 01:11:47,293
Which one should we go with?

1116
01:11:47,294 --> 01:11:49,229
Ugh, I'm about to go crazy.

1117
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:54,599
- I haven't been up there at all today.
- I'm so curious to see what it looks like.

1118
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,595
- These two are totally up to fate.
- Corn syrup is all I got to see today.

1119
01:11:59,596 --> 01:12:04,913
- I've only heard that there's others.
- I don't even know what's up there.

1120
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:11,325
The other ones that we are thinking are
going to sink to the bottom anyway, right?

1121
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,495
- Is it the candle?
- No, candles don't float.

1122
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,695
They don't float in water or oil.

1123
01:12:16,696 --> 01:12:18,924
So it's not the candle?

1124
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:24,542
[What will Kwang Soo and So Hee choose?]

1125
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,478
[Kwang Soo and So Hee choose
the chili oil.]

1126
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,645
[Don't touch our candle.]

1127
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:40,894
[Gary and So Min are given a top hint,
and a chance to make an exchange.]

1128
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,392
- You two are looking awfully close.
- Even slapping each other like that?

1129
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:46,185
You're thinking that you're close
to winning the race, is that it?

1130
01:12:47,453 --> 01:12:51,136
[What is the hint that they've been given?]

1131
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:54,635
[Gary and So Min are
currently in fifth place.]

1132
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,737
This is the top hint you have for us?

1133
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:58,725
[With their recent hint, they know
that their corn syrup isn't a winner.]

1134
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:01,180
Let's just go for what we
were thinking.

1135
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:05,287
<i>I think the thing about being on top
is what's most important.</i>

1136
01:13:05,288 --> 01:13:08,697
<i>- Like floating on something?
- Something with very light density?</i>

1137
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:12,037
Yes, I think that's what is it.
Something that would float on top.

1138
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,854
[Gary and So Min also guess
it to be related to density.]

1139
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:18,602
[Everyone seems to be leaning
towards the chili oil.]

1140
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:23,906
Okay, it's time to announce the results
of the final mission.

1141
01:13:23,907 --> 01:13:29,035
The team that is standing in the top spot
will be the ultimate winners of the race.

1142
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:33,313
A cylindrical measuring case
will be brought forward.

1143
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:38,460
Place your team's token of love
inside that cylindrical vase

1144
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:43,503
and the team with the token that floats
on top will be today's winner of the race.

1145
01:13:45,163 --> 01:13:49,008
[Token of love's current standing.]

1146
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,282
The first team to go...

1147
01:13:51,283 --> 01:13:54,173
- Yoo Jae Suk and his water..
- Water is a given.

1148
01:13:54,174 --> 01:13:57,850
- That's going to be the bottom.
- Sorry, but how about our marbles?

1149
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:00,941
[Their marbles are going to be
submerged underwater.]

1150
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,277
Maybe our peanuts
will have a chance of floating to the top.

1151
01:14:05,152 --> 01:14:08,730
[Dumps in the water into the cylinder.]

1152
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:11,352
It's definitely not ours.

1153
01:14:11,353 --> 01:14:14,948
Next, Ji Suk Jin.
Dump your peanuts in there.

1154
01:14:14,949 --> 01:14:16,828
[Second to go are Suk Jin,
and Yerin's peanuts.]

1155
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:18,432
Can we do it later?

1156
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:21,591
I've dumped a lot of peanuts into my drinks,
and they sink down to the bottom.

1157
01:14:21,855 --> 01:14:23,371
[Peanuts are dunked in.]

1158
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:28,311
[Peanuts sink way down to the bottom.]

1159
01:14:28,312 --> 01:14:31,323
- Kwang Soo, dump your corn syrup in there.
- What about the chili oil?

1160
01:14:31,324 --> 01:14:33,555
The chili oil should be dumped in first!

1161
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,238
- What if this melts in the water?
- Sorry, but what about our marbles?

1162
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:41,341
Let us just dump it in there.

1163
01:14:42,497 --> 01:14:45,172
Dump it in without getting any of it
to stick on the walls of the cylinder.

1164
01:14:45,173 --> 01:14:47,389
[Where will the corn syrup sit?]

1165
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:50,616
The corn syrup can push
the peanuts up to the top.

1166
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,360
[No way!]

1167
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:57,049
[The magic of density!
The peanuts are pushed up to the top!]

1168
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,575
The water and the peanuts
are pushed up to the top!

1169
01:14:59,576 --> 01:15:03,222
[The peanuts are pushed up to the top
thanks to the corn syrup's heavy density.]

1170
01:15:03,223 --> 01:15:05,230
Time to dump in the marbles.

1171
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:06,943
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyun's turn
to dump in their marbles.]

1172
01:15:06,944 --> 01:15:11,102
[Will the marbles show an unexpected result
just like the peanuts had?]

1173
01:15:11,103 --> 01:15:14,967
- Dump the larger one in there.
- Be careful not to crack the cylinder.

1174
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:23,526
[No chance of that happening.
The marbles clunk down to the bottom.]

1175
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:26,871
- I guess it's not going to be us.
- Candles don't float in water.

1176
01:15:26,872 --> 01:15:28,542
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo's candle.]

1177
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:32,594
You know those floating candles?
They usually have something on the bottom.

1178
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:34,616
Melted wax would float though.

1179
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:39,828
[Wait, it's floating!]

1180
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:41,984
Ji Hyo, they're floating!
Don't put anymore in there.

1181
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:45,197
[The candles are floating just fine
on their own!]

1182
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,986
- What do we do, Ji Hyo?
- I told you that the candle is the winner.

1183
01:15:49,987 --> 01:15:53,566
- Ji Hyo, we could actually win this!
- My peanuts are still floating, too.

1184
01:15:54,644 --> 01:15:57,376
- My peanuts are floating, too.
- Look at the peanuts.

1185
01:15:57,377 --> 01:15:58,756
[Current standing-
Candles vs Peanuts.]

1186
01:15:58,757 --> 01:16:02,420
- Peanuts shouldn't be floating, right?
- Pipe it down.

1187
01:16:02,421 --> 01:16:06,286
And finally... dump the chili oil in there.

1188
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:09,105
[The only token left remaining
is Gary and So Min's chili oil.]

1189
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:14,095
[What will be the outcome of the chili oil?]

1190
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:15,826
- Is that floating?
- Stay up there.

1191
01:16:15,827 --> 01:16:18,007
Stay up there, my candles.

1192
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:28,207
[Just who... will be the ultimate winner?]

1193
01:16:28,936 --> 01:16:31,678
Come on, candle!
Let it be the candle!

1194
01:16:33,204 --> 01:16:37,161
[The chili oil is floating
back up to the top!]

1195
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,728
Float to the top, peanuts!
Come on, peanuts!

1196
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:45,347
[The peanuts are slowly
starting to sink to the bottom.]

1197
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:50,563
[The peanuts are sinking
to the bottom of the chili oil.]

1198
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,034
- The candle is still floating!
- Everything is under the oil.

1199
01:16:54,035 --> 01:16:55,122
[Will the candle really be the
final winner?]

1200
01:16:55,123 --> 01:16:59,581
[The candles are still remaining on top!]

1201
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:06,311
[Floating on top are
Ha Ha and Ji Hyo's candles!]

1202
01:17:06,693 --> 01:17:11,027
[Ha Ha, and Ji Hyo are the final winners
of the Greatest Love!]

1203
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:15,732
[The magic of density-
Candles take everyone by surprise.]

1204
01:17:15,733 --> 01:17:20,083
Oh my, I can't believe this!
I seriously can't believe this!

1205
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:23,316
[Even the candles are enjoying their
moment of victory from the top.]

1206
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:29,141
- Ji Hyo's luck is seriously unbeatable.
- When So Hee heard of this game...

1207
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:33,859
she figured out the game when she heard it,
and was talking about the density of it all.

1208
01:17:34,236 --> 01:17:39,798
She kept talking like she was so smart even
as I kept telling her that it was the candles!

1209
01:17:41,397 --> 01:17:43,896
She kept asking how I could not
know about their density!

1210
01:17:44,469 --> 01:17:48,593
- I told you that it was the candles!
- I'm so sorry.

1211
01:17:48,594 --> 01:17:52,269
- I really didn't think it was the candles.
- Myeonwalgwon ended up winning.

1212
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:58,080
- I seriously can't believe...
- Ugh, this is hurtful to my pride!

1213
01:17:58,081 --> 01:18:00,637
- Then peanuts aren't it?
- No, not the peanuts.

1214
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:03,084
But the peanuts did
give a run for their money.

1215
01:18:03,085 --> 01:18:05,557
[But at a closer look,
one peanut is still floating up on top.]

1216
01:18:06,998 --> 01:18:09,408
- The peanuts did stay up there.
- Hey!

1217
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:11,463
What are you doing?

1218
01:18:13,346 --> 01:18:15,655
The peanuts aren't up there anymore!

1219
01:18:15,656 --> 01:18:17,758
Ugh, that's so spicy!

1220
01:18:18,622 --> 01:18:21,849
[What a piece of work...]

1221
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:25,903
- Give me some water!
- Did you not see the chili oil in there?

1222
01:18:26,018 --> 01:18:27,304
