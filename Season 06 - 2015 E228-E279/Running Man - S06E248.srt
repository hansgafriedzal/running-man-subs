00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,620
[There hasn't been any
penalties as harsh as this.]

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,739
[Only those who show their
persistence will live.]

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,250
[Polar opposites]
[The Running Man Penalty Race.]

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,969
[Underneath the spring sky.]

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,480
[A small car is parked.]
- Why are they doing this to us?

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,879
- We can't get off?
- They told us not to get off yet.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,769
- What's this?
- There are two red carpets...

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,199
- they come from there, and us from here.
- There's guests.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,049
- That's crazy.
- How did you get in?

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,909
Ji Hyo is out of breath.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,679
- Ji Hyo, why are you stuck?
- Isn't Ji Hyo supposed to be on top?

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,710
Jong Kook is too big.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,769
My hip hurts!

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,819
Where's Kwang Soo?

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,999
- Kwang Soo isn't here.
- There's no Kwang Soo.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,019
- I didn't know.
- It's a limo!

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,339
It's a limo!
Is it coming here?

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,449
- I thought they were going to be squished.
- It's not fair!

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,819
This is the polar opposite.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,479
[They can feel it in their bones.]

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,479
- Is Kwang Soo there?
- Why Kwang Soo?

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,249
- It can't be...
- I forgot about Kwang Soo.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,249
- Why is Kwang Soo there!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,709
- What is he?
- It doesn't make sense.

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,849
What are you a Hallyu star?

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,619
[Arrogant.]

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,079

00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,709
[Displeased.]

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,050
He sucks at emceeing.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,169
What do you mean he sucks?

34
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,339
I will introduce you to the guests.

35
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,939
No matter how much time has passed,
he is a powerful presence!

00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,649
[The cryogenic patient
who enjoys his renaissance!]

37

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,079
[The cryogenic patient who didn't age.]

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,849
Such old moves.

45
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,249
Old dance.

It's been a while.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,909
It smells weird in the car.

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,679
There are five guys in this small car.

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,739
It's like the smell of bean sprouts.

52
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,849
[Bizarre expression.]

53
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,569
What are you saying?
He's weird.

54
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,999
From Thailand's prince to a man.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,084
[From the Pacific to the Atlantic...]

56
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,019

[Thailand's prince, Nichkhun.]

61
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,939
Are we doing something good today?

62
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,109
[Straight away to the members.]

63
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,539

The American Jun Hyung, American,

The unstoppable is here!

66
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,540
Capturing both males and
females' attention!

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,819
Dangel... dangerous lady!

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,249
- You're spitting so much!
- What are you talking about?

69
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,819
- [Wait a moment, Jun.
- When you said 'Thailand', too...]

70
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,200
- No, no...
[Let me continue.]

71
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,450
From F(x)... Amber!

72

[All of a sudden, a fan meeting.]

76
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,109
[Be prepared to see her boyish charm.]

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,280

He has Formosan background.

- It's the last guest.

85
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,109
Good at talk shows and slapstick.

86
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,109
He makes the audience's head
turn with his timing!

87
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,600
A fitting character for variety shows.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,510
M.I.B's Kangnam!

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,450
[M.I.B.'s Kangnam, from another world.]

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,449
He's like an old man.

91
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,369
[He's randomly punching in the air.]

92
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,800
[What's wrong with him?]

93
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,249
[He keeps performing his dances.]

94
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,969
[Is he still dancing?]

95
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,310
His legs look so short.

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,049
[At last!]

97
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,200
[He goes out of the screen.]

98
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,369
[Where are you going, Kangnam?]

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,309
- But he's always like that.
[Energetic from the start.]

100
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,559
Hello, everyone!

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,620
Guests who are energetic like
that, gets tired quickly.

102
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,049
Let me introduce the next guest.

103

Call us out one by one.

Please come out, Running Man!

108
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,279

your wedding!

113
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,399
- Next month.
- Congratulations!

114
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,769
Yo! Thank you very munch.

115
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,109
I used to say that in elementary school!

116
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,049
- Thank you very munch!
- Munch.

117
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,219
Even I did that when I was a kid.

118
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,170
I really thought... what do I say...

119
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,419
I'll do it again, oh my gosh!

120
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,619
What are you doing?

121
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,619
He prepared a lot of things to say!

122
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,449
I think Running man starts too early.

123
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,139
I'll do it again.

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,479
What do you mean, you'll do it again?

125
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,599
I'm so happy.

126
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,619
That was hard?

127
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,049
[That's what he prepared?]

128
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,399
You look like General MacArthur.

129
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,369
[General MacArthur Jun's
Running Landing!]

130
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,199
The bottoms look like
he's ready for a farming activity.

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,620
For Henry, he doesn't really
know Ha Ha.

132
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,479
You said you didn't know Jong Kook?

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,770
No, I've met him a lot at the gym.

134
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,109
People meet him often at the gym
more than as a singer.

135
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,169
So you don't know anyone here?

136
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,169
- Jae Suk.
- You know me, right?

137
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,279
- It's Henry, not Helry.
- What about him?

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,619
- Hi.
- This is the first time meeting him today.

139
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,309
He doesn't know.

140
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,849
He doesn't watch TV.

141
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,199
- Henry, do you know her?
- Hello.

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,399
Hello. You've met me at the airport?

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,799
Oh right, we saw each
other on the airplane.

144
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,109
The woman he met on the airplane.

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,909
The guy he met at the gym.

146
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,400
The guys he doesn't know.

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,770
[I know them all now.]

148
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,939
Nichkhun has been on the
show so many times.

149
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,479
How many times is it now?

150
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,340
But every time Nichkhun came on
the show, it was very hard.

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,419
When Nichkhun comes, it's
physically draining.

152
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,109
Is it hard today?

153
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,800
This race, is the Polar Opposites Race.

154
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,169
The teams will do missions,
and according to the missions

155
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,369
three teams will get to
enjoy the experience.

156
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,599
Meanwhile, the rest of the teams
will experience the worst.

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,479
The three lower-ranked teams will get

158
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,284
a penalty ball with your names
written on it.

159
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:18,285
A penalty?

160
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:23,110
In the final mission, the teams
with penalty balls will draw and

161
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,649
the final team will get
the extreme penalty.

162
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,650
Just two.

163
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:35,280
Our youngest PD went to
test the extreme penalty.

164
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,139
He has already done it.

165
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,909
You're showing it to us now?

166
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,280
What penalty is it?

167
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,339
Does it come on screen?

168
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Everyone will shake with
fear together watching it.

169
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,619
[Huh?]

170
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,250
[What is this?]

171
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,879
[Oh heavens.]

172
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,279
[Automatically taking a step back.]

173
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,080
[No way...]

174
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,819
[An uneasy feeling...]

175
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,109
[Arising to the top...]

176
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,400
- It's okay with the breeze?
- It's fine.

177
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,649
[50 meters high]
[20 story apartment.]

178
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,219
[This visual is bungee jumping?]

179
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,019
[His shaky hands.]

180
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,219
[Is he going to jump at that distance?]

181
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,479
One, two, three!

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,649
- Jump, we're ready to go.
[It seems a little unusual.]

183
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,140
Three, two, one, jump!

184
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,199
[The cord...]

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
[is unlatched!]

186
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,309
Jump!

187
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,619
[What is this?]

188
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:10,019
[This unreal situation.]

189
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,739
[Everyone's surprised.]

190
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,649
Wow!

191
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,199
There's no cord!

192
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,399
[This is the final penalty?]

193
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,649
Jump!

194
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,400
[There is no cord!]

195
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,679
[The height of 50 meters!]

196
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,279
[Vertical drop!]

197
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,970
[Then straight down into the net.]

198
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,800
[There's no time to scream.]

199
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,969
[The cordless bungee jumping
in Inje, Kangwon Province.]

200
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,969
[Now it's your turn.]

201
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,739
You really need to be brave!

202
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,109
Honestly!

203
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,449
If you betray me...
I'm serious about this today.

204
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,679
[He's guilty.]

205
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,449
Out of everyone, it will only be two.

206
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,999
Only two will go.

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,819
One from this team,
another from this team.

208
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,079
Okay?

209
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,139
I have a busy schedule.
Like really busy.

210
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,910
I have a tight schedule.

211
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,619
Starting with Henry, pick a member
you'd like to be partners with.

212
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,049
Running man members can reject.

213
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,679
- Henry
- I hope no one gets hurt.

214
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,619
We won't get hurt!

215
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,249
The fact that you said you didn't
know me was the biggest scar.

216
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,109
[Sorry...]

217
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,110
Come on!

218
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,799
Henry's choice, one, two, three!

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,819
- Jae Suk!
- Okay!

220
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,169
[His foreign-like expression.]

221
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,799
Henry's a good athlete.

222
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,509
[Amber, with her entire body is saying no.]

223
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,309
Oh, you worked out.

224
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,879
- I'm better!
- I'm better than before!

225
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,820
- No, I'm better!
- No, it's me.

226
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,649
[All of a sudden a push-up contest.]

227
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,619
Why are you doing this, guys?

228
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,569
This is like foreign style.

229
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,399
Now, the next is Kangnam.

230
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,139
- Jong Kook.
- Okay!

231
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,939
He's the most sly foreigner
I've ever seen.

232
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,049
I think we'd be good partners...

233
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,649
Ha Ha.

234
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,939
[Extreme adrenaline couple.]

235
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,569
Nichkhun!

236
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,710
- Me?
- Me!

237
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,509
- Gary.
- Yes!

238
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,199
[Gary looks stronger then the rest.]

239
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,079
Nichkhun, you must not
want to go to Inje.

240
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,569
We can't lose today!

241
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,279
[Now only Big Nose and Blank Ji are left.]

242
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,199
[Jun Hyung is in dilemma.]

243
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,339
What am I supposed to do?

244
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,019
[Choosing Big-nose
is better for the variety show.]

245
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,279
Come here, Suk Jin.

246
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,828
I refuse it!

247
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,479
I refuse it.

248
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,142
[Humiliating!]

249
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,654
[The first man who
was refused by Big-nose!]

250
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,257
I only picked you
because you look pitiful!

251
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:17,339
Combine our ages, it's almost 100!

252
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,285
- Is that so?
- Almost a hundred?

253
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,449
Okay, I'll take care of you.

254
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,279
- Oh, okay.
- Not if you don't want it!

255
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,028
[The second humiliation.]

256
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:35,019
[The almost-hundred couple is paired up.]

257
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,169
- We'll lose the game?
- Yes, we will.

258
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,399
I think we'll be going to Inje.

259
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,909
Let's hope not.

260
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,169
[The worst penalty
in Running Man history!]

261
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,114
[If you want to avoid
this extreme penalty...]

262
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:56,628
[stay in the top three
for every mission!]

263
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,109
Don't think about anything else!

264
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,399
- Just think about victory.
- Just victory!

265
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,857
No matter what, we need to win.

266
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,479
- Fight, Amber!
- Fight, Ha Ha!

267
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
Do you know
what 'yapsap' (sly) means?

268
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,849
Yapsap?
Yaps...

269
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,969
Biyul!
(Cunning)

270
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,909
Biyul, you mean this?

271
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,657
[That is Biyum. (rhinitis)]

272
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,885
I think this might be by luck.

273
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:28,169
You're physically strong, but not smart?

274
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,479
What are you talking about?
I'm smart!

275
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,428
Hurry up!

276
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:36,939
We need to get there quickly!

277
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,219
What were you doing?

278
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,449
I didn't go to the bathroom
this morning.

279
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,399
- The filming started too early!
- I know.

280
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,879
Many people are competitive.

281
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,139
They're no match for you.

282
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,819
You're the best!

283
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,114
I feel so relieved to be with you.

284
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:01,049
Where did you learn all that?

285
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,339
Where did you?

286
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,999
People call it 'abu' (flattery).

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,599
Abu?
Abu Dhabi?

288
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,369
Not Abu Dhabi, a praise in an
exaggerated way that is not sincere.

289
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,049
That's what 'abu' means.

290
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,735
But I really meant it.
Is it okay?

291
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,142
It's okay if you mean it.

292
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:23,879
I really feel like everything
will be okay with you.

293
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,514
I hope we don't have to
go to Inje together.

294
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:29,619
No, we won't.
I'll do my best today.

295
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,771
[This team doesn't seem so strong...]

296
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:42,139
I think Ha Ha and Amber are
very possible.

297
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,309
Let's do our best, Ji Hyo!

298
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,857
What's that?

299
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,479
What?

300
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,509
What is that for?

301
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,457
They've installed the camera.
I think that's for us!

302
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:00,620
Let's hurry!

303
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:04,279
That's for us?

304
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,971
- Yes?
- Is that our mission?

305
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,857
[High hi!]

306
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:18,539
[What in the world is that?]

307
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,942
[It's set at the sixth floor.]

308
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,509
This is...

309
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,714
something that we use
when there's a fire.

310
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:41,057
[It feels really bad.]

311
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:44,057
What's wrong?

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,342
Why are you standing there?

313
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,819
What is that?

314
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,449
Why is it there?

315
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,139
Why, what?
What?

316
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,369
What are they doing?

317
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,449
Are they crazy?

318
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,171
Why did you set out the penalty?

319
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,369
What is it?

320
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,139
- What's going on?
- Just tell us what it is.

321
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,449
We need to talk to the manager.

322
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,909
What is going on?
This upsets me!

323
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,858
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

324
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,019
The first mission is 'Plot Twist Quiz.'

325
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,449
Before I announce the mission

326
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,799
I'll let you know the reward and
the penalty for the first mission.

327
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,539
[We must be dreaming...]

328
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,709
I can't express myself enough!

329
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,484
You didn't eat, did you?

330
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:36,485
No.

331
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,879
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes.

332
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,309
Why are you asking us that?

333
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,514
We've prepared a special
breakfast for you.

334
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,909
For the top three teams

335
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:52,369
you'll eat a high-class course meal
at a cozy and warm sky lounge.

336
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,256
I think we'll going
to eat on the crane.

337
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:59,479
- Did you just say we?
[Are you volunteering?]

338
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,199
I mean... the lower-ranked teams...

339
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,819
The three lower-ranked teams will

340
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,939
will eat on the crane
facing each other.

341
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,302
If you successfully eat on the crane...

342
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,539
Do you really think we can eat?

343
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,079
You'll receive one penalty ball.

344
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,371
Just one penalty ball for each team.

345
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,514
But if you give it up and get down

346
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,599
you will receive ten penalty balls.

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,019
Ten balls are too much!

348
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,342
Either doing it and lower
the possibility for the final penalty

349
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:32,800
or giving it up and
make the possibility higher.

350
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:45,999
We're late!

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,028
- What's that?
- We're late!

352
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,109
Are we supposed to clean the window?

353
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,810
No, you'll eat there if you're
ranked 4th, 5th, and 6th...

354
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,057
- Eating outside?
- On that crane.

355
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,019
That's for us?

356
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,120
[Out of his mind]

357
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:07,171
If we lose at the quiz game,
we'll eat there.

358
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:09,449
For the quiz game, get inside

359
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,199
and make up some questions
for your partner.

360
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,769
Quiz?
He's not very good at Korean!

361
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,399
We're in trouble.

362
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,199
You're not good
at understanding Korean!

363
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,771
[But why is this the 'Plot Twist Quiz'?]

364
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,479
What would Kangnam know?

365
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,799
Kangnam... Kangnam...

366
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,219
M.I.B., Kangnam...
Japan...

367
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,509
I need to make the questions
that Khun can get.

368
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,519
'Where's the capital of Thailand?'
It's too easy, right?

369
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,599
[But, does Gary know that?]

370
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,749
I don't want to get the penalty balls.

371
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,970
Eggs, you know what the eggs
of sharks are called, right?

372
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,249
It's caviar, you know.

373
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,049
[The questions are for Jong Kook,
why caviar?]

374
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,256
'However, ' I really wanted
to use such a word.

375
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:04,109
Doesn't that sound so mature?
'However.'

376
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,714
[A mature person
must use a conjunction.]

377
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,220
It's all good.

378
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,657
[Everybody's done with their questions.]

379
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:17,449
- Let's go.
- I think you will get this.

380
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,609
- Maybe it's too easy.
[We have really easy questions.]

381
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,399
I'm afraid it'll be this simple.

382
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,257
Questions are easy,
do you think it's that simple?

383
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,941
[That's right.
It's 'Plot Twist Quiz.']

384
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,309
Please submit your questions.

385
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,828
It can't be that simple.

386
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:36,649
I think they will mix up the questions.

387
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,709
We'll be answering your own quiz.

388
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,679
Like I said,
It's the 'Plot Twist Quiz.'

389
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,339
The questions you made up

390
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,599
will be asked to the other
team members.

391
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,771
Everyone will solve them together.

392
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:55,619
We'll give you a cell phone.

393
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,279
The phone is for...

394
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,084
we'll give you a phone
number for each question.

395
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:06,769
Only the first one who's connected
can answer the question.

396
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,369
Do not call if you
don't know the answer.

397
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,849
Each team will have ten
running balls.

398
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,971
Until the quiz is over, you
need to use up the balls.

399
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,514
For example,
if Yoo Jae Suk's question is

400
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,509
answered by other team's member...

401
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:29,057
Then their ball will be added
to Yoo Jae Suk's team.

402
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,509
On the contrary...

403
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,649
If Henry answers Yoo Jae Suk's question

404
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,300
you can take one of your balls
and give it to the others.

405
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,509
The first one to give out a question is

406
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,878
Henry.

407
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,449
Henry!

408
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,548
This question is...

409
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,200
- Did you press '010'?
- What's wrong with you?

410
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,199
Do not press '010' in advance.

411
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,109
Let's not do that.

412
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,942
Then, I'll just press '01' only.

413
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,514
Don't press any of the numbers.

414
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:14,819
- Didn't you press the numbers?
- No, I didn't.

415
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm not that kind of a person.

416
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:20,139
Ask the question!

417
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,509
Are you ready?
One, two, three!

418
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,619
If you tap, tap, tap the Canadian tree,
what comes out?

419
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,571
[Tap the Canadian tree,
and something comes out?]

420
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:33,057
[What is he talking about?]

421
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:38,685
- Okay, okay.
- Tell us the number to call.

422
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:41,769
The number is here!

423
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,514
Tap, tap, tap!

424
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:47,019
[This is very easy, isn't it?]

425
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:54,139
- What does that mean?
[They call the number anyway.]

426
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,369
I'm so late.

427
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,569
I pressed the wrong...

428
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,199
- I'm connected!
- I'm connected!

429
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,941
I'm connected, too!

430
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:06,449
The line is busy.
What was that?

431
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,739
Jae Suk!

432
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,679
It's busy!

433
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,369
- Hello.
- I'm connected!

434
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,339
Please give me the answer.

435
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,109
If you tap the tree!

436
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,027
Please give me the answer.

437
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:23,569
She doesn't even know.

438
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,169
Really?
If you tap the Canadian tree?

439
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,739
[Do you really know the answer?]

440
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,628
- Three, two...
- Santa Claus!

441
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,649
Santa Claus!

442
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,509
- Why?
- All of a sudden?

443
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,169
What is she talking about?

444
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,479
It's a different number now.

445
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,079
Erase the history.

446
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,509
- What comes out?
- Okay!

447
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,714
Am I connected?

448
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,509
- Are you connected?
- Nichkhun is connected!

449
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,885
- Wow!
- Hello.

450
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,799
Mine is connected, too.
I'm sorry, I've got the wrong number.

451
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,509
He's got the wrong number.

452
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,999
- I don't want to get a penalty!
- Maple syrup!

453
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,399
[Maple syrup]

454
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,419
Does it count if he speaks in English?

455
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,913
[Correct!]

456
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,169
[Nichkhun got the first question.]

457
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,114
- Maple, maple.
- Did you know it?

458
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:24,569
Of course I knew it.

459
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,969
Canadian trees are maple trees.

460
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,709
The leaf on the Canadian flag
is the maple leaf.

461
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,314
- But it comes out?
- Let me explain it.

462
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:37,419
You know what Thor has?

463
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,599
If you tap the tree with a hammer,
the syrup comes out.

464
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,399
- I can't get connected.
- You need to press it fast.

465
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,369
I don't know the answer.

466
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,309
One ball from Nichkhun and Gary

467
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,771
was added to Jae Suk
and Henry's basket.

468
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:57,939
That was a wise move!

469
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,969
Let's give it to the one team!

470
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,599
Let's all give it to them!

471
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,257
Let's do it!

472
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,142
[The second person is Kangnam.]

473
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:11,849
The eggs of sharks are called caviar.

474
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,969
However!

475
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,049
What do you call the eggs of dolphins?

476
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,079
[The name of dolphins' eggs?]

477
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,885
Reveal the phone number!

478
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,999
It's different number, again.

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,019
It's not in the history.

480
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,628
- I'm late.
- I pressed it wrong again!

481
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:35,800
[Who will be connected this time?]

482
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:40,219
- Hello.
- Yeah!

483
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,219
It's difficult.

484
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,539
What's the answer?

485
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,679
Dolphins' eggs...

486
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:54,599
- don't exist.
- Correct!

487
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,109
[Big-nose broke the trick!]

488
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,769
Dolphins breed.

489
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,971
- You didn't know that.
- I know it. They're mammals!

490
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:06,685
Actually, I was thinking about
a giant pickled pollack roe.

491
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:11,849
[A pollack would have been
shocked to hear it.]

492
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,819
You know, a giant roe you can hug.

493
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,714
A dolphin's egg is
a giant pickled pollack roe.

494
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:21,427
That's so funny.

495
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:22,428
Kim Jong Kook.

496
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:24,109
Is it me?

497
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,285
I'm sure people from
foreign countries don't know it.

498
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,969
Japanese and Korean people know it.

499
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,399
What if I know it?

500
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,599
- I'll give you all my property.
- Really?

501
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,569
I hope Henry gets it.

502
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,419
[It'll be a jackpot reward.]

503
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,599
Are you ignoring us?

504
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,285
The question can't be difficult.

505
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:48,228
What's the name of the
Japanese street snack with octopus?

506
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,569
Revealing phone number

507
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,342
[What is it?]
- It'll be me!

508
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,109
[Who will be connected this time?]

509
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,819
- Hello.
- Is that you?

510
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,769
Yoo Jae Suk.

511
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,539
He's connected for the first time.

512
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,049
[Will we answer one, finally?]

513
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,569
[Was the question too easy?]

514
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,279
It's economy-yaki.

515
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,885
[Eco... nomy... what?]

516
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,909
It's economy-yaki.

517
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,819
[What is economy-yaki?]

518
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,970
[Combination of economy-class
and Okonomiyaki?]

519
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:34,620
Did he say 'Okonomiyaki'?

520
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,714
- Is that a Korean dish?
- I didn't know that.

521
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:42,709
[Everyone is panicking.]

522
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,171
That's like a seat on a plane.

523
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:48,509
You won't be able to find the answer.

524
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,969
[The next one is...]

525
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,369
- Is it me?
- It's me!

526
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,739
I thought 'Okonomiyaki' was
the answer but...

527
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,999
[Did he say it and get it wrong?]

528
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,649
Economy-yaki?

529
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,249
[Economy-yaki?]

530
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,909
[The cheap snack food
must be economy-yaki.]

531
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,285
They confuse me, too!

532
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,599
I didn't know this was
a difficult question.

533
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,171
I have a strong feeling.

534
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:22,819
Please, sit down.

535
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,939
It's already connected.

536
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,849
Hello!

537
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,709
The answer is Tako-yaki!

538
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,879
That's right!

539
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,657
Economy-yaki?

540
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,742
- I don't know it.
- I've never had it, though.

541
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,713
Kangnam is from Japan.

542
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:48,649
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Good Luck!

543
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,741
I think the question will be easy.

544
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:52,824
He's a candidate for the penalty.

545
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,371
No, he's not a candidate
for the penalty.

546
00:28:55,372 --> 00:29:00,170
What did Song Ji Hyo give as a gift
when Lee Kwang Soo moved?

547
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,771
Ready, and the number is!

548
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,914
The number is gone!

549
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,819
Why am I so slow?

550
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,314
I pressed it wrong.

551
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:16,199
[Who's connected?]

552
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,169
The line is busy!

553
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,739
It's always busy!

554
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,509
It's me!

555
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,079
[Blank Ji is connected!]

556
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,057
It's me.
The answer is an electronic fan!

557
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,219
Correct!

558
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,541
[They've successfully answered
their own question.]

559
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,969
Lee Kwang Soo!

560
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,000
Song Ji Hyo!

561
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,049
Congratulations!

562
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,885
[Where would he put the penalty ball?]

563
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:59,799
Nichkhun and Gary have another ball.

564
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,019
[He feels betrayed again.]

565
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,827
I made a mistake.

566
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:05,849
Then fix it quickly!

567
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,049
Can I change it?

568
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,969
No, you can't do it again.

569
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,571
You can't do it again.

570
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,742
[He's acting as if it were
a real mistake.]

571
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:22,339
I see how it is.

572
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,171
Gary is serious!

573
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,228
- I see how it is.
- No, Kwang Soo was...

574
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,049
I'm serious today!

575
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,109
I see how it is.

576
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,739
It was a mistake.

577
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,909
I see it now.

578
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,285
I'm really serious today.

579
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,939
[Giraffe... you little!]

580
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,114
Kang Gary!

581
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,541
- You're disqualified!
[You've betrayed me every time.]

582
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,219
I've been frustrated by you!

583
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,909
[You've been always betrayed me.]

584
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,085
If you betray me...
I'm serious about this today.

585
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,800
Why?

586
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,199
[Giraffe, I'm watching you...]

587
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,369
[Frightened]

the three lower-ranked teams...]

[Eating at a high elevation!]

00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:20,342
The next one to give
a question is Park Jun Hyung.

592
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,279
I don't have to call...

593
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,210
[Suk Jin and Jun Hyung, Gary and Nichkhun,
Jae Suk and Henry's teams have 11 balls.]

[We'll get the last question.]

595
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,714
Question...

'The Plot Twist Quiz.']

debut as g.o.d.?

598

[The phone race start!]

600

601
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,479
I'm late.

602
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,619
- What is this?
- Please!

603
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,199
I know this one.

604
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,879

You know, the line is busy!

605
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,339
Jae Suk, quickly!

606
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,679
Who calls this fast?

607
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,019
Hello?

608
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,256
Yes!
Hello!

609
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:11,742
Lee Kwang Soo. We need
to give him a different phone.

610

611
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,027
Wrong!

612

[Please play again.]

613
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,369
[He doesn't have a quick mind.]

614
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,569
Reveal the number!

615
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,819

616
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,819

Yes.

623
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:44,205
You don't know the answer.
I don't think you know it.

624
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:49,139
- Only I know it.
- Suk Jin, Grasshopper knows it.

625
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,657
He doesn't know it.

626

decided by Jae Suk's answer.]

[Which team will be the
last upper ranked team?]

628
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,939
I was with them when they debuted.

629
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,709
Then, he must know it.

630
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,457
1999, at the 'Declaration of Saturday.'

631
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,369

- Yes!

634
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:20,999
- Grasshopper was there!
- Yeah!

635
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,484
Move one of your balls to
Park Jun Hyung and Ji Suk Jin's bowl.

636
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:29,249
Why did I hug him?
Why did I?

637
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,369
- Yeah!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

[Depressed]

639

go up on the crane for your meal.

Penalty?

642
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,742
It's going to be penthouse style.

643
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,970
- Are we going to stay indoors and eat?
- Yeah.

644
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:57,114
Don't you know it's more expensive
to get an outside seat in a higher spot?

645
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:00,799
You don't even know that's how it is.

646

[Experiencing the polar opposites, start!]

647
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:05,989
This is for the top three teams.

648
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,228
We're going to be in trouble
if you can't make it in the top three.

649
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,969
This place is beautiful!

650
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,085
You didn't have to prepare this much!

651
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:21,000

- Thank you so much!

652

Gary...

653
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,339
won't be talking to Kwang Soo
for a while.

654
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,542
Who am I supposed to attack, then?

655
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:32,139
We shouldn't get hurt
for this kind of stuff.

656
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,227
I picked him because Gary and
Jong Kook always avoided penalties.

657
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:38,085
Gary didn't receive any penalties?

658
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:41,139
Think about when we went to Taiwan.

659
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,109
I went to Taiwan.
These people went there, remember?

660
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,164
That's right.

661
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:50,219
We went all the way
to Taiwan for a penalty.

662
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,685
There are people who avoid
big penalties all the time!

663
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:57,880
She didn't go to Taiwan.
Don't shake hands with her.

664
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:02,169
Until the other teams finish eating...

665
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,739
you should stay, then you'll
get one penalty ball.

666
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,109
If you want to get down,
you'll get ten penalty balls.

667
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,619
Let's just give it up.
I can't stand the height.

668
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,399
- I'm really sorry.
- No, Suk Jin!

669
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,449
[It'll be great if you give it up.]

670
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:26,169
If we give it up, we will have to
take ten penalty balls.

671
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,742
Why don't you say something?

672
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:29,199
[Depressed Gae]

673
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,839
We won't take ten balls!

674
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,169
- Don't give up!
- I see.

675
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,309
[Big-nose gets on the crane.]

676
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,819
How are we supposed to do it?

677
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,219
It's very shaky.

678
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,509
It doesn't even make sense!

679
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,770
- Seriously...
[Who am I and where am I?]

680
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,428
Everyone, today...

681
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,449
I'll do my best.

682
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,166
Kangnam, here's the food.

683
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,539
What are we eating?

684
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,141
We're going to eat this?

685
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:02,941
['Ra' to the 'Men.'
Ramen!]

686
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:04,941
Enjoy the food.
We will lift you up.

687
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:07,028
How can we eat ramen without hot water?

688
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:08,810
I don't even eat ramen.

689
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:11,371
It's like a spaghetti,
just mix with sauce.

690
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:13,771
- It's ramen!
- They're having ramen.

691
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,171
Eating ramen is the worst penalty
for Jong Kook.

692
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,879
Let's go!

693
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,000
[We'll take off!]

694
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,657
[Their hearts start pounding.]

695
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,114
[I'm not going to look down.]

696
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:34,457
What's with this angle?
It's tilted!

697
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,199
Where are we going?

698
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,600
Wait, wait!

699
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,514
Wait a moment!

700
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,942
This is crazy!

701
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,199
- It's too high!
[They're still far from 25 meters.]

702
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,279
The food is dropping, man!

703
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,514
Isn't this too high?

704
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,679
Don't look down.

705
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,628
With my luck, I think I'll bounce
out of the safety air cushion.

706
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,942
Stop lifting up!

707
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,279
I want to get down!

708
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,769
I'll take the ten penalty
balls and get down!

709
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,771
- We're not going down!
- Hurry up and eat!

710
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,599
Didn't you tell me you're winning
a lot these days earlier?

711
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,569
This is different.

712
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,479
This is really scary...

713
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,857
[Not a rising trend, just rising.]

714
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:30,342
They're crazy.

715
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,571
Stop!

716
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,079
Stop complaining and eat it!

717
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,085
Should I eat or should I sleep?

718
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,656
This ramen is so soggy!

719
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:47,684
Do you want some more kimbap?

720
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:48,906
I'm fine.

721
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:51,769
Yours has more sauce than mine.

722
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,684
[The teams on the crane gondola
feel camaraderie, too.]

723
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:56,448
Let's just eat.

724
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:02,542
[The crane has stopped.]

725
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:07,999
- Then, Ha Ha will propose a toast.
[The crane has reached the target spot.]

726
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,599
- Forget all the bad feelings from earlier.
[They're having a luxurious wine party.]

727
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,879
- Our friendship will be high!
- High!

728
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,942
- Our love will be deep!
- Deep!

729
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:21,619
- Our glasses will be equal!
- Equal!

730
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,219
- For Running Man!
- For Running Man!

731
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,879
For your happiness!

732
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,849
For your safe return!

733
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,742
[Think about us, too...]

734
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,771
We don't know what will
happen to us.

735
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:43,309
Let's just enjoy this moment.
Who knows if we will be there next time.

736
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,828
Suk Jin is calling.

737
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,879
Hello.

738
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,228
Hello.

739
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,827
- Is this Jae Suk?
- Yes.

740
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,737
Hurry up and finish eating!

741
00:38:55,738 --> 00:38:57,742
I'm sorry we're recording now.

742
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,999
What? We're recording, too!

743
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,057
Jae Suk...

744
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:07,085
- Please eat quickly!
- Yoo Ja Sik! (You little)

745
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:11,799
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

746
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,309
This is luxurious!

747
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,557
[Tomato carpaccio soup
and salmon salad.]

748
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,257
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is.

749
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,449
Hurry up!

750
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,709
Hurry up and finish eating!

751
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,599
We have to stay here
until they're done eating?

752
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,085
- Hurry up!
[If it wasn't for Lee Kwang Soo...]

753
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:35,457
[They want to eat fast,
but this is a full course dinner.]

754
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:39,769
[The entree is Korean beef
tenderloin steak.]

755
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,371
This steak is very good.

756
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,314
It's really good!

757
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,879
Ji Hyo, hurry up.
We're going to go crazy.

758
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,484
We're eating meat, so it takes time.
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:57,485 --> 00:40:00,049
Just chew it up and swallow it!

760
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,479
Just chew it up!

761
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,057
Gary looks very gloomy.

762
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:06,849
He's serious.

763
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,971
[Do not touch me!]

764
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,171
He won't make eye contact with me.
He actually avoided it.

765
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,342
- I'm going to write something for Gary.
- Like what?

766
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:22,849
I think he's playing.
Gary is smiling now!

767
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,909
Let me just show it to him.

768
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,849
I think this is good enough.

769
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,114
- Go, go, go!
[I hope he realizes my true feelings.]

770
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,085
- I don't have a selfie stick now.
[It's against the light.]

771
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,369
We can't see it.

772
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,571
[Do you see this, Gary?]
[This is how I feel about you.]

773
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:48,739
[Gary, I love you.]
[We're almost done eating.]

774
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,457
[Gaze]

775
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:58,079
[If you realize how I feel,
please smile at me once.]

776
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,685
I can't even curse now.
This drives me crazy.

777
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:03,599
[His heart is crashed.]

778
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,000
Kwang Soo, he thinks
you're making fun of him.

779
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:13,249
Kwang Soo is shocked.

780
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,142
I'm just saying I love him.

781
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,679
He totally misunderstood you.

782
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,199
He can't see this letter.

783
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,369
[Gae and Kwang's crisis...
How will it end?]

784
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,139
Let's just all get down.

785
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,739
Two gondolas together.

786
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,819
- If we do that...
- Jun, it's okay.

787
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,509
Inje is going to be worse
than this.

788
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:43,449
- Just be patient.
- It's like if you fall from here.

789
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,939
We don't know what's going on.
Let's just take some selfies.

790
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,849
Are you okay?

791
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,769
Everyone, one, two, three!

792
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,739
[Up in the sky.jpg]

793
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,679
[Mood in the cloud.jpg]

794
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,819
[We are gondola brothers.jpg]

795
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,369
Look, there's an airplane!

796
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,249
That makes it more scary.

797
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,399
We're parallel with the airplane.

798
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,257
I hope we can meet each other
after the next game.

799
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,539
I hope we stay the same.

800
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,709
We're done eating.

801
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,509
- Are you done?
- They said they're done.

802
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,171
- They're done!
[We're free!]

803
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:26,079
Getting down is even scarier.

804
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,799
[Having a meal at the high altitude
is completed.]

805
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,657
We're back!

806
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:35,371
If you had given it up, you
could have collected ten balls.

807
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:38,714
But everyone stayed until the end,
so each team will get one ball.

808
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:43,741
It will raise the possibility of getting
picked for the final penalty.

809
00:42:43,742 --> 00:42:45,799
They're not getting this ball?

810
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,139
For the next game...

811
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,139
we need to put them in
the lower ranks.

812
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,539
We need to help each other.

813
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,599
That way, each team
will have one ball in there.

814
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,857
[Crane Gondola Brothers have formed.]
- One, two, three, fighting!

815
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:02,419
We are a team!

816
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,541
I thought it was going to be
physical games, that's why I chose him.

817
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,514
They might have something physical later.

818
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:12,049
Please put the
penalty balls in this box.

819
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,399
Can I just pick a ball from the box?

820
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,171
Just to test their luck.

821
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,199
[Why does he make so much fuss?]

822
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,249
[Suk Jin and Jun Hyung]

823
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,971
[That's bad luck.
Why did you pick my team?]

824
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,371
- They're killing us.
- This drives me crazy.

825
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:37,109
[Suk Jin and Jun Hyung again!]

826
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:42,314
[Who will be picked for the
final penalty in the real game?]

827
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:49,057
[The present possession
of the penalty balls.]

828
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,820
[The second mission site,
the waterfront of the Han River.]

829
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:56,649
[The Han River is full of spring air.]

830
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,657
[What kind of polar opposites
will they experience here?]

831
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:02,679
[What awaits the six teams is...]

832
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,969
[the six special sunflowers.]

833
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,171
[And a number attached
to each sunflower.]

834
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:22,939
I think if you get something wrong,
it will drop water.

835
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,399
What's that for?

836
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,619
What could it be?

837
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,449
[Those sunflowers look unlucky.]

838
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,509
This is the second, and the last mission.

839
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,885
- It's already the last mission?
- Excuse me...

840
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,539
do we really have to go to Inje?

841
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,171
Just one team will go.
One team out of all.

842
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:43,683
For now, Yoo Jae Suk
won't have to go.

843
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,371
You don't have
any penalty balls in there.

844
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:48,914
I know you're anxious, if you
think you will lose this game...

845
00:44:48,915 --> 00:44:51,819
- You know what to do?
- We're a team!

846
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,079
[A member of Team Lounge intrudes.]
- Go away!

847
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,714
You know, we're Team Gondola.

848
00:44:59,628 --> 00:45:01,999
[For some reason,
everyone wants to join the group.]

849
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,114
- Gondola!
- Gondola!

850
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,819
[Quietly]

851
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,085
This is frustrating!

852
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:19,219
According to the results
of the mission...

853
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,279
The top three teams will...

854
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,969
be on a high-class yacht.

855
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,309
You can enjoy some snacks
and go on a cruise.

856
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,599
That sounds nice.

857
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,341
Just hang out on the yacht.

858
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:34,399
What will happen to
the three bottom teams?

859
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,599
The three bottom teams will...

860
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,079
wear diver suits

861
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,539
and swim across the

862
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,569
Han River.

863
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,619
- What?
- Are you serious?

864
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,114
[The finish line is already
set up at the opposite site.]

865
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,885
Are you for real?

866
00:45:55,742 --> 00:46:00,057
[Is... this... true?]
- This suit makes you float on water.

867
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:03,114
[2013. 12. 29]
[The first time crossing the Han River.]

868
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:06,224
[They made paper boats,
and crossed the Han River.]

869
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:09,112
[2014. 3. 2]
[The second time crossing the Han River.]

870
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,200
[With 7 College students, they made
boats out of 7 different materials.]

871
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:14,339
[However...]

872
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,685
[This time, without a boat?]

873
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:21,819
These suits will make you float.

874
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,109
This Han River idea is so old!

875
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,479
You need to ask our permission!

876
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,571
Maybe it was sensational
in 1976, but not now!

877
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:37,257
Isn't it fun to swim?

878
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:40,628
[Another person is excited to swim.]

879
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:43,369
Isn't the water cool?

880
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,485
We've made a boat before,
but it's on our own this time?

881
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:48,619
Sir...

882
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,369
I can't swim.

883
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,399
Even if you can't swim, this
suit will make you float.

884
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,879
And we give you flippers, too.

885
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,485
If you cross the river within 30 minutes,
you will be given one running ball.

886
00:46:58,486 --> 00:47:00,999
If you give up in the middle,
you will receive ten balls.

887
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,479
This is insane.

888
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,342
There are six shower booths.

889
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:10,309
If water falls from the shower,
when you turn on the water

890
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,514
you'll be dropped out from
the game.

891
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:15,569
You can choose a number you want.

892
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,142
We'll chose the number by

893
00:47:17,143 --> 00:47:20,909
throwing a dart at the board.

894
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,428
The dart board is divided
by color in front.

895
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:26,249
But it has the numbers at the back.

896
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,428
Meaning you'll be choosing the number.

897
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,139
It sounds unfair for some reason.

898
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,309
It's vague!

899
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,569
Let's just do something physical!

900
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,999
Can't we just grab people
and throw them away?

901
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,199
You guys are older, complain
or something!

902
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,514
- This is not my territory.
- I'm not good at quarreling in Korean.

903
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:51,139
This isn't about capability, but luck.

904
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,657
So it's supposed to be fair
for everyone.

905
00:47:53,658 --> 00:47:56,371
But it's upsetting for some reason.

906
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:59,228
Let's go swimming!

907
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:03,339
What's your favorite number?

908
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,999
- Amber!
- Ha Ha!

909
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,169
Let's pick six since it's June.

910
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,479
[Everyone followed their feeling
and chose their numbers.]

911
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,142
Don't worry about it!

912
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,569
- This is 50:50.
- That's right.

913
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,879
They're saying we have to
cross that river?

914
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,114
- We'll cross the Han River?
- It doesn't make sense!

915
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:26,509
By swimming?

916
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,219
Look at that river!

917
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,399
[Half of you will be facing it soon.]

918
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,849
You mean, we will cross the river?

919
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,799
That's what they mean?

920
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,971
The Han River?

921
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:40,999
Who's going to throw the dart?

922
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,969
Let Amber do it!

923
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,542
- Are you okay?
- How far is the distance?

924
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,914
- What's the width of the river?
- About 1.5 Km.

925
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:57,457
Go, Amber, go!

926
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,309
How come the Gondola Brothers
are gathered here?

927
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,485
[The Gondola Brothers
are at numbers 4, 5, and 6.]

928
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:10,139
It's upsetting!

929
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,485
- Please, please, please!
- Amber!

930
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,479
[Their life is in her hand!]

931
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,942
Amber, I really hate to
receive penalties!

932
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:22,599
[He's laying more burden on Amber.]

933
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,769
Good luck, Amber!

934
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,849
This is all about luck!

935
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,914
You're the youngest and you can swim!
Pick yourself!

936
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:33,679
Get ready!

937
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,342
Rotate the board!

938
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:40,428
[Amber throws the dart without hesitation.]

939
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,449
[The dart is on yellow color.]

940
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,399
It's on yellow!

941
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,200
- We're wearing yellow!
- I think it's you!

942
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,169
We don't know the number yet.

943
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,857
Please, please help us!

944
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:08,049
[This makes the chance
of going to Inje higher!]

945
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:12,769
If you want to change
your number, do it now!

946
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,169
Let's switch!

947
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,739
Please switch the number with us!

948
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,049
- Please!
- Should we?

949
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,649
- Should we switch with them?
- No, just stay.

950
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,399
Gary!

951
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,770
- Do you want to switch with us, Gary?
- No!

952
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,799
Stop talking!
Don't talk to me!

953
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,769
Let's switch, Gary!

954
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,619
Gary, come on!

955
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,219
I'm not switching!

956
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,339
No!

957
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,649
- Let's switch!
- Just stay!

958
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,909
Let's just stay like this.

959
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,139
Jun Hyung!

960
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,249
Two!

961
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:57,457
[Who will be the first team
to across the Han River?]

962
00:51:06,685 --> 00:51:08,885
[Winner!]

963
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:14,714
[Gary and Nichkhun are chosen.]

964
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,657
[We survived!]

965
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:26,914
[Devastated]

966
00:51:27,942 --> 00:51:31,800
[The yellow was number six.]

967
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,914
You know why I wanted
to switch spots, Gary?

968
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:37,139
[He can't hear anything.]

969
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,314
[Gary and Nichkhun receive
two penalties in a row!]

970
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:51,219
- Kwang Soo is toying with Gary.
- What are you saying?

971
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,139
[Crossing the Han River is one thing,
but they're stepping toward Inje.]

972
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,569
I wanted to switch for you.

973
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,714
[Anyway, Gary and Nichkhun are chosen.]

974
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,649
We'll pick the next number.
This board has five numbers.

975
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,679
We're choosing another number?

976
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,457
[This time, Nichkhun
is going to pick a number.]

977
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,685
[Each team is deciding on a number.]

978
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:21,942
[Ha Ha and Amber pick number two.]

979
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,457
- Do you want to choose number five?
- Yes, I have a feeling.

980
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:34,049
You do?
Then I choose three.

981
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,679
- What's wrong?
- It's okay.

982
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,909
I'm nervous!

983
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,649
It's up to you, Nichkhun!

984
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,371
- Come on!
- Please, Nichkhun!

985
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,019
I really wanted to switch for Gary.

986
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,199
- I love Nichkhun!
- Yeah, 2PM!

987
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,542
- Pick number 2 for 2PM!
- I'll throw it!

988
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:56,139
Please!

989
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,256
I really hate to swim!

990
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,000
[Nichkhun throws it lightly.]

991
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:03,539
[It's on the red.]

992
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,999
[What number will it be?]

993
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,628
Does anyone want to switch?

994
00:53:08,629 --> 00:53:12,999
- We will!
- Just stay here.

995
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,769
- Let's switch!
- No, we won't.

996
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,769
- You don't want to switch?
- No.

997
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,649
Please aim for their heads.

998
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,199
Teams, hug each other.

999
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,169
Please!

1000
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,649
Three!

1001
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,599
Two!

1002
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,742
- I can't cross the Han River!
- One!

1003
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,914
Please! Not this time!

1004
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:39,142
[Winner!]

1005
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,628
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are chosen.]

1006
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:49,942
[We survived again!]

1007
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:56,742
[Is that from the shower
or are they crying?]

1008
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:02,139
[The red was number one.]

1009
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,914
We almost switched with Kwang Soo!

1010
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:08,314
[They're teasing him like kids.]

1011
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:13,739
[The dart has answered Gary's wish.]

1012
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,169
[The second team to receive
the penalty is chosen.]

1013
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,685
[Giraffe's bad luck overpowers
the Goddess of fortune.]

1014
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,939
[There's only one team left.]

1015
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,057
Let's just go to the spot that's
left at the end.

1016
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,479
[Ha Ha and Amber pick number one.]

1017
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,142
They picked number one, because
they think it won't happen again.

1018
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:39,769
It's fine.
We've been lucky with leftovers.

1019
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,649
Leftovers are good!

1020
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,028
We pick number three!

1021
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,619
Please let us survive once!

1022
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,857
Please give us a round of applause!

1023
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:53,049
This is the last time!

1024
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:56,219
[Ji Hyo will throw the dart.]

1025
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,849
Ji Hyo!

1026
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,828
[Ji Hyo predicts number two.]
- Don't do that, Ji Hyo!

1027
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:03,569
Number two, number two!

1028
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,939
Number two, number two!
Number two, number two!

1029
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:11,169
Number four, number four!

1030
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,628
Number four is good, too.

1031
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,679
- Number four is good, too?

1032
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,509
Kwang Soo, why?

1033
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:22,279
If I get to swim across with you,
you won't be able to cross it!

1034
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,085
Why are you being so scary?

1035
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:27,079
Wait and see!

1036
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,571
I think I could carry out this one,
but not the final penalty...

1037
00:55:30,572 --> 00:55:32,819
- Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo!

1038
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,171
[The last team's fate is in Ji Hyo's hand.]

1039
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,457
- Anything except number one!
- Ji Hyo!

1040
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:41,769
The last team will be...

1041
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,969
Rotate the board!

1042
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,739
Just one more time!

1043
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,539
If we can pass this time!

1044
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,771
Ji Hyo!

1045
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,399
It's on yellow!

1046
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,190
Yellow, yellow!

1047
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:58,914
Kangnam's hair is very yellow!

1048
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,941
[What number will it be?]

1049
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,941
- Do you love me?
- Of course!

1050
00:56:03,942 --> 00:56:04,942
Let's go!

1051
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,771
Just one more time!

1052
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:15,257
Oh no!

1053
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:21,109
Please!

1054
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,339
Do you want to switch with us?

1055
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,883
- Was it from the shower?
- No, it wasn't.

1056
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,742
- It's wasn't?
[Then, where did the water come from?]

1057
00:56:29,743 --> 00:56:32,342
Lee Kwang Soo!

1058
00:56:33,428 --> 00:56:35,085
[I'm sorry.]

1059
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:38,142
[He's a funny guy.]

1060
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,219
[They feel relieved.]
- It's not us!

1061
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,739
We'll count down with everyone.

1062
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,279
Three! Two! One!

1063
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,400
[The dart is thrown!]

1064
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,599
[The number of yellow...]

1065
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,971
[is the last warriors
to cross the Han River.]

1066
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:09,771
[Who will be the last team?]

1067
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:13,685
Two, one!

1068
00:57:14,571 --> 00:57:16,628
[Winner!]

1069
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:20,714
[Ha Ha and Amber are the
last members.]

1070
00:57:22,971 --> 00:57:25,857
[We survived!]

1071
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,800
[I understand how you feel.]

1072
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,600
[The yellow was number one.]

1073
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:45,771
- How did you know?
- It felt really weird.

1074
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,799
You two are exempt.

1075
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,999
The three bottom teams will have
to swim across the Han River.

1076
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,283
If you cross the river within 30 minutes,
you will be given one running ball.

1077
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:59,283
If you give up in the middle,
you will receive ten balls.

1078
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:01,542
The rest of you will go
to get on the yacht.

1079
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:04,219
Please get ready for swimming.

1080
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:08,399
[We knew it wouldn't be easy to
swim across the Han River...]

1081
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,219
[but we never knew it would be this hard!]

1082
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,509
Everyone's crazy!

1083
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,049
[The penalties of the polar opposites!]

1084
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,514
[It begins!]

1085
00:58:20,885 --> 00:58:23,479
[The three teams are getting ready.]

1086
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,257
We're wearing these.

1087
00:58:26,828 --> 00:58:29,279
[The final weapons are given.]

1088
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,109
- It's upsetting!
- Don't be upset!

1089
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,199
It's frustrating!

1090
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,109
We were picked at the last round.

1091
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,249
- Henry!
- Yes, Jae Suk!

1092
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,714
[Why me?]

1093
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:46,569
[On the contrary,
the teams on the yacht...]

1094
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:52,079
Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba!
('Circle of Life')

1095
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,019
I never knew this day would come!

1096
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,999
I'm really bad at pot luck!

1097
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,100
[The group photo time!]

1098
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,819
[2015. May
The yacht is awesome!]

1099
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,509
This is first time out of five years!

1100
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,541
Henry, you're such a lucky guy.

1101
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,569
I love you, Jae Suk.

1102
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:16,449
Jun, it's all thanks to you!

1103
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,539
[They are giving each other a hug.]

1104
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,969
Let's have some food, everyone!

1105
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,909
Yeah!
Come on, baby!

1106
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,369
This is very comfortable.

1107
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,849
Thank you.

1108
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:35,109
One, two, cheers!

1109
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:38,019
Thank you very munch!

1110
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,399
For our safety, not to go to Inje!

1111
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,342
I love Running Man!

1112
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:49,509
I just hope I don't have to
go to Inje.

1113
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,884
You don't have to worry too much.

1114
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:55,339
We'll be near you in full gear.

1115
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,799
- Just take it easy.
- Okay.

1116
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,200
[Who are we?
Why are we here?]

1117
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:06,342
If you're ready,
you will start swimming!

1118
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:08,479
This drives me nuts!

1119
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,969
[Step by step in flippers.]

1120
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,514
- It's cold.
- It is!

1121
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:20,569
[Dives without a hitch.]

1122
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,909
It's cold!

1123
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,171
[Nichkhun starts swimming immediately.]

1124
01:00:26,142 --> 01:00:29,257
[Two young men threw
themselves into the Han River.]

1125
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:34,849
On your back, and keep kicking.

1126
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,539
[They follow Amber's advice.]

1127
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,971
Keep kicking, Ha Ha.

1128
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:45,450
[Crossing the Han River, start!]

1129
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,969
Did they start swimming?

1130
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:57,200
They're swimming!

1131
01:01:00,228 --> 01:01:02,509
They've started!

1132
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,685
[They're swimming right next to the yacht.]

1133
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:08,914
Kwang Soo, turn your body.

1134
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:12,771
You're a good swimmer!

1135
01:01:15,057 --> 01:01:16,057
Kwang Soo!

1136
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:19,057
Catch some abalone, since
you're in the water.

1137
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:21,879
- What?
- Abalone!

1138
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,909
Stop talking nonsense!

1139
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,569
- You can't get abalones here.
- Oh, this is a river.

1140
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,419
They live in the ocean.

1141
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,539
Amber is just like a dolphin.

1142
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,399
Amber!

1143
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,285
[From backstroke to freestyle,
she looks like she's in a water park.]

1144
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:42,199
[And she's fast!]

1145
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,049
Who's leading at the front?

1146
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,799
[In front of the yacht,
someone is leading everyone.]

1147
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,019
- Who is it?
- Where is Nichkhun?

1148
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,539
[Nichkhun is here.]
- That was Nichkhun!

1149
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,970
How is it possible?
He's good at everything!

1150
01:01:57,971 --> 01:01:58,971
Cheer up!

1151
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:02,057
He sings well, he's handsome
and he's even good at swimming.

1152
01:02:02,058 --> 01:02:04,509
He's really good.

1153
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,342
But he's crossing the river,
and we're on the yacht.

1154
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,885
[Gary, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo
couldn't get further than the yacht.]

1155
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,685
Kang Gary!

1156
01:02:23,857 --> 01:02:26,219
I want to give up!

1157
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,399
I'd rather get ten balls!

1158
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,799
You'll get ten penalty balls!

1159
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,171
- No, we're not giving it up!
- I want to stop here!

1160
01:02:33,172 --> 01:02:37,479
- No!
[Kwang Soo, you will put us in danger?]

1161
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,742
Everyone is crazy!

1162
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,942
[It's very peaceful here.]

1163
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,419
Gwon Ryul, can you believe this?

1164
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,939
It's hard to believe we could avoid that.

1165
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,219
We've always taken those penalties.

1166
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,339
Suk Jin, Kwang Soo, and I
are really unlucky.

1167
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,971
Kwang Soo couldn't stop
the chain of bad luck.

1168
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:02,971
You're totally free
from the final penalty...

1169
01:03:02,972 --> 01:03:06,219
I'm afraid if I have to go to Inje.

1170
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,169
I can't believe it.

1171
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,539
I hope it's not me.

1172
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,800
I should cancel what I've just said.

1173
01:03:16,257 --> 01:03:18,569
[By the way...]

1174
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:22,028
[Nichkun starts speeding up again.]

1175
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,371
[He keeps swimming
across the Han River.]

1176
01:03:31,028 --> 01:03:34,771
[In the middle of swimming,
he's still very handsome.]

1177
01:03:36,428 --> 01:03:39,479
Nichkun reached the halfway point.

1178
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,909
Nichkun is really fast.

1179
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,569
He's already passing it.

1180
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,457
He's swimming over there!

1181
01:03:49,485 --> 01:03:54,739
[People might think
he's enjoying his vacation.]

1182
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,400
[Relaxed.]

1183
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:03,228
[Amber is swimming in second.]

1184
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:08,371
[Powerful swimming.]

1185
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:14,219
Go faster!
Hurry up, come on!

1186
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,373
Come on!

1187
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:22,828
[Helping Ha Ha and
swimming at the same time.]

1188
01:04:24,457 --> 01:04:27,939
I feel sorry for you.
You're almost there!

1189
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,800
She's amazing!

1190
01:04:31,228 --> 01:04:33,280
You're almost there!

1191
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,057
Ha Ha, you're almost there!

1192
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:41,819
- 2PM!
- Nichkun crossed it.

1193
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,279
- Yo, Nichkhun!
- You're awesome!

1194
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,114
[Nichkun is awesome!]

1195
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,942
[He's making a landing.]

1196
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:56,914
[Nichkun has arrived.]

1197
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,514
[Nichkun is exhausted.]

1198
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,657
They're here.
Ha Ha is arriving, too.

1199
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,714
They're fast at the end.

1200
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:17,771
[Welcome.]

1201
01:05:21,457 --> 01:05:24,085
[Amber and Ha Ha arrive.]

1202
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:31,457
[The strength drained out
from his legs.]

1203
01:05:34,085 --> 01:05:36,942
I will never do it again.

1204
01:05:39,142 --> 01:05:42,419
You've worked so hard!

1205
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,619
- Amber is amazing!
- She is!

1206
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:50,171
She could have swam faster,
but she was taking care of me.

1207
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:56,569
Nichkun is a good swimmer.

1208
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,600
[While they're praising each other...]

1209
01:06:00,771 --> 01:06:04,314
[Gary, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo
are still swimming.]

1210
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,200
[Grabs]
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1211
01:06:10,714 --> 01:06:14,771
[Is he helping her?
Or is he relying on her?]

1212
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,799
[Gary grabs Kwang Soo.]

1213
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,000
Gary!
I'm sorry, it's my bad!

1214
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,628
[Gary is pulling everyone in the front.]

1215
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,657
[Swimming itself is tiring,
why would they add more trouble?]

1216
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:45,971
You're almost here!

1217
01:06:47,114 --> 01:06:50,571
[Miraculously, they're near the land.]

1218
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,714
[They're swimming at full speed.]

1219
01:06:57,428 --> 01:06:59,909
Come on!

1220
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,799
Good job!

1221
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,509
Fighting, Gary!

1222
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,942
- Fighting, Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo!

1223
01:07:06,943 --> 01:07:09,819
- Fighting, Lee Kwang Soo!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1224
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,709
Lee Kwang Soo!

1225
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,914
Gary is cursing!

1226
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,619
Song Ji Hyo!

1227
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,400
You're almost here!

1228
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:24,599
[Everyone arrives.]

1229
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
You're here!

1230
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:30,819
[As soon as they arrive...]

1231
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,885
Pull a trick on me!

1232
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,449
[All six members have arrived.]

1233
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:43,249
I had a cramp on my leg once.

1234
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:48,109
It's going to happen to me now.

1235
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,909
- We did it!
- We're awesome!

1236
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,909
You did it!

1237
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:56,079
- Gary!
- Drink some water.

1238
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,419
You've worked so hard!

1239
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,539
Are you okay?

1240
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,879
The important thing is...

1241
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,369
it'll be okay if you can
avoid going to Inje.

1242
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:11,879
Let me announce the results.
Everyone has succeeded.

1243
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,799
No one gave it up.

1244
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,457
[Kwang Soo was the last one.
He did it in 29 minutes.]

1245
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,679
[Emotion explosion]

1246
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,800
[He must really hate going to Inje.]

1247
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:25,710
I thought I would stay in the water,
if I failed.

1248
01:08:28,257 --> 01:08:30,771
I thought about staying
in the water forever!

1249
01:08:30,772 --> 01:08:32,679
Be careful!

1250
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,800
Gary kept cursing at me
in the water.

1251
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,819
I feel much better now.

1252
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,914
[He kept cursing in my ear.]

1253
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,509
[The final penalty is...]

1254
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:52,709
[the cordless bungee jump!]

1255
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:56,714
[Who will have the misfortune
of carrying out the last penalty?]

1256
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:02,679
You've worked so hard
crossing the Han River.

1257
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,599
[A round of applause for them.]

1258
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,657
[More than anything,
no one gave up in the middle.]

1259
01:09:07,658 --> 01:09:09,249
No one gave it up!

1260
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,709
Amber kept belching
while she was swimming.

1261
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:18,314
[Amber let out a big burp.]

1262
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:23,449
- Then we will start.
- Hope everyone is lucky.

1263
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,879
- You must be so relaxed.
- What a day for me!

1264
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,139
It doesn't even make sense!

1265
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:33,219
Henry said he's lucky
and it was true.

1266
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,599
I expected to receive the final penalty

1267
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,999
but it turned out this way.

1268
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,171
Jae Suk should have had
five balls at least.

1269
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:44,309
This is Suk Jin and Jun Hyung.

1270
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:47,049
Lee Kwang Soo and Song Ji Hyo.

1271
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,539
Kangnam and Jong Kook.

1272
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,799
Ha Ha and Amber.
One of each!

1273
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,709
Nichkun and Gary have two balls.

1274
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:59,199
[Oh, no!]

1275
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:03,739
- You never know.
- That's right, this is nothing.

1276
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:09,227
We've done this before.
Five balls have won over one ball.

1277
01:10:09,228 --> 01:10:12,019
Then it's totally by luck!

1278
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,709
I want to pee!

1279
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,019
[Starting the draw!]

1280
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,879
[The die of hell has been thrown!]

1281
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,857
Inje... I can't...

1282
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:27,600
[Everyone is nervous.]

1283
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:34,710
- Don't worry, it won't be us.
- I feel a tingling on my spine.

1284
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,780
[Out of six balls, only
one ball will be drawn!]

1285
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,819
One, two...

1286
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,599
- Who is it?
- Don't look!

1287
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,000
[Who will receive the final penalty?]

1288
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:51,369
[You will experience an adrenaline rush!]

1289
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,509
[The cordless bungee jump!]

1290
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,169
[Watching it makes our knees
knock together!]

1291
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,909
- Don't look!
- Let's not look at it!

1292
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,999
[I... really want to avoid this.]

1293
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,457
Don't look!

1294
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:13,909
[Finally!]
- Is it out?

1295
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:16,449
Is the ball out?

1296
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:18,479
[Blocking for a spoiler!]

1297
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,200
Don't be afraid!
It won't be us!

1298
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,400
- Please!
- Don't look!

1299
01:11:25,142 --> 01:11:27,428
[Kwang Soo gets close to Gary...]

1300
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:29,799
It's my team?

1301
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,649
Is it my team?

1302
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:36,314
- Did you see if it's us?
- I didn't see it.

1303
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:43,649
I'm holding it.

1304
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,199
- I think it's us.
- Why?

1305
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,449
My nostrils are itchy.

1306
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:51,619
- Please!
[No one has seen it yet!]

1307
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,448
Gary is crying!

1308
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,799
The final penalty goes to...

1309
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,085
- One!
- Please!

1310
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,649
[Suk Jin and Jun Hyung!]

1311
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,200
[Frozen]

1312
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:17,369
[The rest are celebrating.]

1313
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,479
[We avoided it!]

1314
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,514
We did it!

1315
01:12:25,914 --> 01:12:28,428
[Gloomy Gary is smiling now.]

1316
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:30,879
[Some in heaven...]

1317
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,342
[and some in hell...]

1318
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,440
[It will test the courage
of this groom-to-be..]

1319
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,657
[Flailing his swimming trunks...]

1320
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,200
[The most impressive moment
ever since the world cup in 2002.]

1321
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,914
[Dreams come true!]

1322
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:56,542
[This must be a dream.]

1323
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,057
I'm so happy!

1324
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:02,880
[We are the world.]

1325
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:06,709
[She looks more excited than
when her song hit number one.]

1326
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:10,649
[Gary is about to pass out.]

1327
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,942
[You did it, Gary!]

1328
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:19,109
I'll pay for everyone's dinner!

1329
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:22,228
[Except Big-nose, let's celebrate!]

1330
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:26,169
At least, I feel better
that they've made up.

1331
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,828
They've gotten closer now.

1332
01:13:29,714 --> 01:13:31,442
Kwang Soo, I love you.

1333
01:13:31,443 --> 01:13:33,599
Gary, it's my fault!

1334
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,228
[The best happy ending.]

1335
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:40,400
Gary is laughing now.

1336
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,399
Gary looks younger now.

1337
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,999
[We've just made up.]
- In a long time, he's Peaceful Gary.

1338
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,199
[Forever Peaceful Gary!]
- You've worked so hard, Nichkhun.

1339
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,039
I've always thought...

1340
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,249
how would it feel to
cross the river by swimming.

1341
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,679
I've thought about it.

1342
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,219
It's tiring.

1343
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,649
I don't think you wouldn't have said it
if you received the penalty.

1344
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,800
Everyone is happy.

1345
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:18,541
Suk Jin told me that
he'd have good luck today.

1346
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:21,649
[Everyone is happy, that's a good thing.]

1347
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:24,514
Let's just think this will
get rid of devils for a year.

1348
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:27,542
Combining our ages... it's almost 100.

1349
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:31,571
[Will they be able to do
the cordless bungee?]

1350
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,085
You know I'm getting married
in exactly one month.

1351
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,539
I almost forgot about it.

1352
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:48,085
I want to meet Little Park Jun Hyung
in the future.

1353
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:54,771
- Should we go up first?
- Let's go up.

1354
01:14:56,571 --> 01:14:58,600
How can we do this?

1355
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:01,085
Seriously!

1356
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:03,399
Should I go up with him?

1357
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,449
Wait a moment.

1358
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,849
It's good to go first.

1359
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,879
Should we go up?

1360
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,657
We'll go up now.

1361
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,885
Cordless bungee...

1362
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:22,028
Suk Jin!

1363
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:24,679
I looked down...

1364
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,969
I was a little brave before...

1365
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:30,057
I thought I could do it...
but now it's not even funny.

1366
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:32,285
[Panic]

1367
01:15:33,514 --> 01:15:35,828
[50 meters high]
[20 story apartment.]

1368
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,939
- Sit down.
- Me?

1369
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,569
I'm not going to do it now.

1370
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,279
- Just lie down.
- I'm not ready.

1371
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,339
- Wait a moment.
- We're not doing it now.

1372
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,819
Don't make me nervous!

1373
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,909
This is not a joke.

1374
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,849
Brother, please...

1375
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:57,169
I think I'm younger than you.

1376
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,019
Brother is whom I can rely on.

1377
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,739
I'll make it as quick as possible.

1378
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,971
You can't make it too quick.
We're filming.

1379
01:16:07,657 --> 01:16:10,199
Honestly, people gave up on it before.
Right?

1380
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,799
- One out of 1,000.
- I'm that one person.

1381
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,342
I can't do normal bungee jumping!
And this is cordless jumping!

1382
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:22,509
[20 minutes have passed.]

1383
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,249
My shoulders.

1384
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,914
Just lie down.

1385
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:29,199
Wait!

1386
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,879
My bottom is out!

1387
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,257
It's supposed to be like that!

1388
01:16:32,258 --> 01:16:35,369
I'm not kidding!

1389
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:40,139
No, not yet!

1390
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,939
Please lift me up.

1391
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:46,909
Not yet, not yet!

1392
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,914
- I'll tell you.
- Please, don't!

1393
01:16:48,915 --> 01:16:50,769
What are you going to do?

1394
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,285
[Panic]
- I'm going crazy!

1395
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,419
Seriously!

1396
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,879
Three, two...

1397
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,969
Let's go, Suk Jin!

1398
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,049
Jump!

Oh, my father!

1407
01:17:48,342 --> 01:17:52,679
Why did I come up?
I need to get down and go up again.

1408
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,085
Yoo Jae Suk!

1409
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,457

I'll do it nicely!

1412
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,709
- Lie down.
- My bottoms are out of it.

1413
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:16,109
It's supposed to be like that.

1414
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:18,199
This is insane!

1415
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,169
Did I really do it?

1416
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,970
This is... I don't know.
I love you!

1417
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:28,599
My mom! I love you, Mom,
Sister, Brother, Niece!

My jaws are locked!

1427
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,619
My nostrils became parachutes!

1428
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,909
[Bounce, bounce!]

1429
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,771
I should have said something fun, too.

1430
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:09,057

at the moment!

01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,449
I think it is safe.

1434
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,141
But I won't do it again.

1435
01:19:19,142 --> 01:19:22,913
- Anyway, Jun Hyung!
- Suk Jin!

1436

One dot for black bean noodle
another for seafood noodle soup.

1453
