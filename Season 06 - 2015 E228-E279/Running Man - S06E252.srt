1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,740
[An ordinary looking high school.]

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,710
[But this place is...]

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,610
[It's time to choose the
order of bluffers.]

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,030
[Come to the roof!]

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,680
How are you supposed to bluff?

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,770
I've never bluffed before.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,850
It's easy.
[I will destroy everything...]

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,030
[that gets in the way.]

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,200
Is that bluffing, right now?

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,830
- Of course.
- It's been a while!

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,940
- Independent study, dinner, music...
- I didn't skip school today!

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,910
[Randomly, he does a gangster pose.]

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey you!
[Haroro, exceeds in bluffing.]

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,450
[Gangster Blank Ji.]

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,230
Look at this!

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,600
Nothing can cool down the
passionate and fiery athletic club!

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,740
Don't lose to the hip-hop club who
only know how to run their mouths!

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,880
Oh, we're the athletic club?

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,880
[We're going crazy right now...]

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,480
[I left my body and soul in the beat.]

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,600
There's a different feel.
Jae Bum is just a rebellious teenager.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,200
[The pungent scent of
the athletic club.]

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,310
I don't have a pose.
[It's time to purify your tired souls.]

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,800
What?
What's that?

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,540
Oh, Jessi's a member?
[The hip-hop club.]

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,400
[A powerful entrance.]
Jessi!

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,650
Are you guys the hip-hop club?

28
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,280
[Hip-hop Goddess, Jessi.]

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,710
[Lazy rapper, Eun Ji Won.]

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,830
[A load of swag, Jae Bum.]

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,600
[A rhyming tyrant, San E.]

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,880
[A hip-hop rhapsodist, Verbal Jint.]

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,170
- San E!
- Gary!

34
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,280
[Welcome to the bluff world.]

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm your fan, San E.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,970
[It's a friendly atmosphere, for now.]

37
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,830
Shouldn't Gary have been on that team?

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,850
- Why Gary?
- Gary's the hip-hop chief.

39
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm not a chief.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Who's the chief?

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,430
I can't be on the same team as her!

42
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,540
He's the chief according to age.

43
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,080
Why did they give this
old boom box to San E?

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,510
[The symbol of hip-hop, a boombox.]

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,450
[I want to try.]

46
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,770
You have to face this on the outside.
Your eardrum will be destroyed!

47
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,310
I can't hear.

48
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,050
[It's a new type of
hearing aid boombox.]

49
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,080
- I'll introduce my teammates.
- I know them.

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,450
- I'll introduce my crew.
- Yeah, go ahead.

51
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,970
Hello, I'm Jessi.
What's up!

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,970
- Ho Jessi.
- What's wrong with you?

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,770
Everyone's so bling-bling today.

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,250
Why am I always on your team?

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,480
We always lose.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,480
[A direct insult.]
Watch your mouth!

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
Stay calm.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,680
[It won't be quiet today...]

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,540
He is my brother, San E!

60
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,650
[Rap Genius, San E.]

61
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,540
San E!
[A hip-hop gesture.]

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940
Did you see that?
He's San E.

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,250
And here we have
the mischievous hip-hopper.

64
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,310
- Mischievous?
- The mischievous rapper, Eun Ji Won.

65
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,540
- Eun Ji Won!
- It's been a while Ji Won!

66
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,340
- You know him.
- Jay Park!

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,370
Jay Park!
[Jae Bum.]

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,170
[This quiet man...]
Isn't he from Seoul University?

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,540
[A forceful public address
about his university.]

70
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,510
[Intelligent Rapper, Verbal Jint.]

71
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,370
- Law School!
- Seoul National University!

72
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,800
Jessi looks like she's the toughest.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,050
[The strong Jessi,
and the gentle lambs.]

74
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,310
- Verbal...
- And they're all nice, too.

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,540
Verbal Jint is nice.

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,740
Why is San E so gentle?

77
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,080
It's because he's beside Jessi.

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,480
We're thinking about trying our best.

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,540
- We're thinking...
- Don't just think it, show it!

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,710
'We're thinking of trying our best.'

81
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,400
What are we doing?
Are we versing them?

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,710
Jae Suk doesn't fit.

83
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,880
He just looks older.

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,370
At least wear your hat backwards!

85
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,050
You guys don't even know
the hip in hip-hop.

86
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,280
When you wear your hat,
you have to wear it forward.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,710
- There we go.
- Oh, just like this?

88
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,770
[He looks silly.]

89
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,230
[An embarrassing look for his team.]

90
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,050
Hey you, come here.

91
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,080
I think those ears suit you
better than your actual ears.

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,510
- It's Yoda ears.
- These ears are more Yoda-like.

93
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,880
Yeah it looks like Yoda ears.

94
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,650
Take off your glasses.

95
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,220
- No.
- This is it!

96
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,280
[I am the hip-hop president!]

97
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,930
[It's not that great...]

98
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,510
You should be blinded.

99
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,830
[The wrong style.]

100
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,230
Forget seeing,
I have triple vision right now.

101
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,340
[Jae Suk's vision.]
It looks cool.

102
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,830
Everyone on this side

103
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,170
are hot and fiery

104
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,140
and are always running towards passion

105
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,680
the athletic club of
Running Art High School.

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,030
The athletic club of an Art school?

107
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,680
- Not a Phys Ed High School?
- What about us?

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,050
Rhythm flows through
their veins instead of blood

109
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,710
and they make every sound into rhymes.

110
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,480
- What is this?
- They shout at the world

111
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,650
the hip-hop club of
Running Art High School.

112
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,910
Did you understand?

113
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,030
After all your classes are done

114
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,850
Everyone is going to the roof...

115
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,340
- Roof!
- Everything goes down on the roof.

116
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,310
The rules are as follows to
determine the king of bluffs.

117
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,910
There are number cards.

118
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,030
And sign cards.

119
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,540
Both teams will each choose one
after classes are done.

120
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,370
The number cards have
the numbers one to six.

121
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,480
The sign cards have add, multiply,
and subtract.

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,540
The team who gets a better result

123
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,830
will pick two cards between
the numbers three to six.

124
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,480
And the other team will pick two cards
between the numbers one to four.

125
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,280
So higher is better.

126
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,000
The first class, if you see across

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,510
is the study hall, so please go there.

128
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,310
[The first class is in the study hall.]

129
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,850
[Do you want to become
the king of bluffs?]

130
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,880
[Earn that title on the roof!]

131
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,250
[Study hall.]
It's the study hall.

132
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,150
[The Best High School Bluffer Race.]
[1st period, independent Study.]

133
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm going to humble Suk Jin's pride.

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,140
[Students who talked during class.]

135
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,770
- What is that?
- That's the rule.

136
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,280
We need to read the announcements.

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,370
I was the class president
during self-study!

138
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,050
A dark force in the teacher has arisen.

139
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,570
I can't proceed with class,
so do some self-studying.

140
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,860
If you keep track of students
who talk during class

141
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,770
I will factor that into their grades.

142
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,630
- Do we lose if our name is repeated?
- I didn't understand anything.

143
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,910
- What do we do?
- I don't know either.

144
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,880
We all don't understand.

145
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,630
- Dark force has arisen.
- Verbal, you understand?

146
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,480
Not really.
Doesn't it just mean blackening?

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,030
Oh my god!

148
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,570
'Doesn't it just mean blackening?'

149
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,940
Wow! It sounds the same!

150
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,450
- Was that Jae Suk?
- 'Doesn't it just mean blackening?'

151
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,770
[A vocal clone.]

152
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,660
[A new skill thanks to Verbal Jint.]

153
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,480
Out of the six, four people get chalk.

154
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,030
And two people get erasers.

155
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,310
When the whistle blows,
go to the other team's black board

156
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,340
and write the name that you
want ousted on the other team.

157
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,250
Then, it has to stay for three seconds.

158
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,880
Only then, you will be ousted.

159
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,740
But isn't 'Verbal Jint'
too many letters?

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,370
English!
You have to write it in English!

161
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,850
[The wrong time for
a real-name movement.]

162
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,000
- Jessi is Ho Yeon Joo.
- It's Ho Yeon Joo?

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,170
- You knew it!
- I didn't...

164
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,430
Gary!
Did you do something wrong to Jessi?

165
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,250
Last time, she told me,
'I can hit on you in two hours'.

166
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,030
Really?

167
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,110
- When did I say that?
- You did!

168
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,230
- When?
- You said that!

169
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,740
Jessi, is two hours enough?

170
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,170
Sorry, but on our team

171
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,370
Kwang Soo has both erasers.

172
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,570
He's holding both,
so you could get hurt.

173
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,650
Kwang Soo's going to hold the erasers,
and I'm going hold people.

174
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,770

176
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,450
[Why are you warning us
on a variety show...]

177
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,800
- You have to be aggressive.
- Okay.

178
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,650
It's best two out of three.

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,430
This is the first round.
Ready, set!

180

[Hip-hop warriors, charge!]

181
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,830
Just write!

182
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,650
- Just write!
- Jessi!

183
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,650
[Kkuk has one person in each arm.]

184
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,250
[The athletic club is
focusing on Jae Suk.]

185
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,340
[Kim Jong Kook is really popular.]

186
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,540
Over there!
Go over there!

187
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,280
[Grabs by the collar
instead of erasers.]

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,110
[Giraffe is also on
defense with erasers.]

189
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,050
Just write!

190
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,310
San E, here!

191
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,510
[San E, out!]

192
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,250
[San E was blocked by
Jong Kook the whole time.]

193
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,170
[The people who are ousted
have to do their punishment.]

194
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,630
[Kick.]

195
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,740
[Jessi kicks Giraffe away.]

196
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,570
[In the meantime, writes Kim Jong Kook.]

197
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,400
[Kim Jong Kook, out.]

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,080
- Am I out?
- Kim Jong Kook's out!

199
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,450

[Yoo Jae Suk, out!]

202
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,770
[Only one person is holding
the eraser on his team.]

203
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,630
[The only defense is Giraffe.]

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,140
[Gary, out!]

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,000
[This time she head locks Giraffe.]

206
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,970
[She throws Giraffe down.]

207
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,740
- Am I out?

- Jessi!
- What are you doing!

221
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,340

223

[Kwang Soo is stopping
Jae Bum at all costs.]

[Best 2 of 3, 1st round,
athletic club wins!]

229
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,230
You did well.

230
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,230
[Way to go Ace!
Ousted 3 people by herself!]

231
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,070
Where's Kim Jong Kook?

232
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,540
Where are the victims?
What did he do?

233
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,900
I thought my arm was
going to be ripped apart.

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,250
What about you, San E?

235
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,080
This is our first time meeting,
but I was grabbed by the collar.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,540
You met him today!

237
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,650
San E's in hip-hop!
You don't know who he is?

238
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,740
Sorry but, I went easy because
this was our first time meeting.

239
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,030
What Jessi?

240
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,050
Wait, why am I out?

241
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,600
Jessi did this to me!

242
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,480
Wait but why am I out?

243
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,510
We wrote your name.

244
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,450
[She understands the rule now.]

245
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,370
Why didn't you tell me?

246
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,910
[We've been playing that way.]

247
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,710
- What are you doing?
- This is a competition!

248
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,050
Jessi blocked me when
I was trying to write a name.

249
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,080
I told her 'not me!'

250
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,540
I couldn't see.

251
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,340
I ousted a lot of people.

252
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,740
- He did the most.
- MVP, MVP.

253
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,370
We lost, what do you mean MVP?

254
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,880
We lost!

255
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,630
Ready...

256
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,710
Why, you little brat!

257
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,650
[I have Kim Jong Kook behind me!]

258
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,650
Bluff!

259
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,370
[Why you little...]

260
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,600
[What are you going to do?]

261
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,250
[I have Jong Kook on my side.]

262
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,770
Doesn't anyone fight on this team?

263
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,110
Look at him.
Do you really want to fight?

264
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,310
[I won't someone who I can
pick a fight with...]

265
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,940
He's not human.

266
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,540
[Best 2 of 3. Round 2 start!]

267
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,680

[Kwang Soo, Gary, Ji Hyo on offense.]

270
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,510
[Verbal Jint is writing Ha Ha
at the no mark zone.]

271
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,540
[No, come here!]

272
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,940
[Ha Ha, out!]

273
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,740
[Kwang Soo takes down San E.]

274
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,850
[Completely blocks San E.]

275
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,050
[It's Ji Hyo, Gary vs. Ji Won.]

276
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,230
[Big Nose is on defense.]

277
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,140
[Erase!]

278
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,400
[Erase again!]

279
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,110
[Big Nose's defense is awesome!]

280
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,310
[Suk Jin! I've tied them up here.]

281
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,140
[Jessi is the master of defense.]

282
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,910
Kim Jong Kook!

283
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,340
[Kim Jong Kook, out!]

284
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,050
[Kwang Soo is blocking San E
who has an eraser.]

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,680
[Ji Hyo is attacking San E.]

286
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,480

[Eun Ji Won is also out!]

289
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,510
All the erasers are out?

290
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,030
[No mark chance.]

291
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,940
[Offense? Defense?]

292
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,000
[Blank...]

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,680
[While he was blanking out]

294
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,600

[The hip-hop team
doesn't have a clue yet.]

298

[Jessi, out!]

299
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,200

[The athletic club wins both rounds.]

301
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,680
What is this?

302
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,140
Someone wrote it here,
but someone else erased it.

303
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,880
Erasing is part of the game, so what?

304
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,170
[You still don't know
the rules of the game?]

305
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,770
Jessi and I were the only ones writing!

306
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,370
Where were you?

307
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,200
- I was erasing.
- But?

308
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,970
- Kwang Soo took my pants off!
- They're weak.

309
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,050
This game is so much fun.
Let's do it again.

310
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,830
[The winner asks for a rematch.]

311
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,480
A two point round.

312
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,430
We'll do this round with 3 points.

313
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,830
And Jae Suk has to kneel
down in front of Ha Ha.

314
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,650
Untie my laces, please.

315
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,710
You can tie his laces for him.

316
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,170
- I'm going crazy.
- Hurry up!

317
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,430
- What are you doing?
- This is...

318
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,370
Good job, good job!

319
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,800
Sorry, but I need to take a picture.

320
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,510
Record a video!

321
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,740
[How does a man kneel down...]

322
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,450
Jae Suk!

323
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,910
[Like this.]

324
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,170
[It's so easy to kneel down.]

325
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,250
[So easy thanks to Kkuk.]

326
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,970
It's not broken, right?

327
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,370
You can tie each other's laces,
it's normal.

328
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,970
Sorry, sorry.
[A bold close-up.]

329
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,480
[A strike on the head.]

330
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,680
- Do it properly!
- Who is it?

331
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,170
[They're scary...]

332
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,830
Sir!
I can't feel my feet!

333
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,910
- Do it quickly.
- And properly.

334
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,740
[Kneel down.]

335
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,830
I'm going to take a picture!
Jae Suk, lift your head up please.

336
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,170
- That's not your face!
- Why are you doing that!

337
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,630
- That's what he usually looks like.
- Hey!

338
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,340
[Summer of 2015... I won't forget...]

339
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,630
Ready, set...
This is worth three points.

340
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,740
If this team wins,
it will turn the game around.

341
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,970
Of course, of course!

342
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,880
Jong Kook!
No hitting!

343
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,000
- We're ready.
- Ready...

344

[Will the hip-hop club
turn things around?]

345
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,250
Oh my god!

346
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,680
Stop!
If you put that on my face!

347
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,880
[The athletic club is
using a 1 on 1 method.]

[Of all times,
he runs into ace Blank Ji.]

351
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,250
[Guys I'm in trouble!]

352
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,110
[Ace Ji Hyo goes through
Jae Suk and starts attacking.]

353
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,830
[On the other hand,
there is chaos here.]

354
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,830
[Kkuk grabs two people in a flash.]

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,050
[Big Nose's incredible defense.]

356
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,510
[Thanks to a good defense,
Kwang Soo joins in on the offense.]

357
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,510
[He removes the only defense, Jae Suk.]

358
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,630
[Ji Hyo is at a no mark zone.]

359
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,140
[Chaos.]

360
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,630
[Blank Ji writes down names
without hesitation!]

361
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk, out!

362
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,450
[He can't get out even if he's out.]

363
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,230
[She's writing a Death Note.]

364
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,630
[She's writing the names of
the hip-hop club in a row.]

365
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,540
[What is this?]

366
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,850
[Jong Kook made a dog pile.]

367
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,450
Eun Ji Won, out!

368
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,970
What is this!
What is this!

369
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,170
[Hip-hop club, all kill.]

370
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,800
[The athletic club wins the re-match.]

371
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,140
[Game over, in a flash.]

372
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,770
I was so hard-working!

373
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,450
[Instead of being sad about their loss]

374
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,830
[they're happy to be free
from the dog pile.]

375
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,570
- What is all this?
- What are you doing!

376
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,570
What's funnier is, didn't one
person write all of this?

377
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,570
Who wrote all of that?

378
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,830
[Do you want a re-match?
The whole team is untying their laces.]

379
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,370
[Angry.]

380
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,110
- Get in line!
- How about a 6 point match?

381
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,980
We'll give you 20 points!

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,630
We'll tie Jong Kook's
with our teeth first!

383
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,940
[We just need Jong Kook...]

384
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,080
Just you wait, in a month or so you'll
have a diss song written in your honor.

385
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,570
Especially you!
You'll have two!

386
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,370
Write one!
Okay?

387
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,880
- Jint, write one!
- I'll write one now.

388
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,280
- Re-match!
- Okay, okay.

389
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,650
The title should be 'shoe laces'.

390
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,030
[Rage.]

391
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:28,230
It's a good title!

392
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,970
<i>I tied them today, shoe laces should I
tie them with my teeth, shoe laces.</i>

393
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,940
[Just you wait...]

394
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,970
The winning team can pick two cards

395
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,540
out of the four numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6.

396
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,600
Just pick one and show us.

397
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,370
Nice.

398
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,420
Out of the signs there are

399
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,340
add, subtract, multiply.

400
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,200
Show us.

401
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
What is it?

402
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,340
Pick two cards.

403
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,600
[They picked sign cards as well.]

404
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,650
[The hip-hop club lost cruelly.]

405
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,110
[But the real winner is
chosen at the roof.]

406
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,680
[The game cards obtained so far.]

407
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,280
[Athletic club vs. hip-hop club.]

408
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,170
[Ready for period two.]

409
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,880
[The hip-hop club finally has
a chance to counterattack.]

410
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,000
[The Best High School Bluffer Race.]
[Period two, music class.]

411
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,480
There are a lot of musicians today.

412
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,140
[It's going to be a dynamic class.]

413
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,940
Feel, soul, my life!

414
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,080
Look at that.
I used to say that all the time.

415
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,800
[The three elements of music
would be rhythm, melody, harmony.]

416
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,050
[But Gary answered feel, soul, my life.]
Do you agree?

417
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,680
Oh, Gary said that?
[Ignorance or bluffing?]

418
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,310
I will find the soul of music
and come back soon.

419
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,030
Don't go to the snack shack
when I'm not there.

420
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,600
What's with this school?

421
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,470
Especially, the other
teammates shouldn't buy

422
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,740
anything while the rep does the mission.

423
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,710
The two teams aren't versing each other.

424
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,200
Is everyone here?

425
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,230
As you can see

426
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,800
you have to pick out
the keywords of the mission.

427
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,020
Each team figure out the
mission and pick one rep

428
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,880
who would best fit
for this mission.

429
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,050
While that person does
the mission as long as possible

430
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:14,050
the rest of the members will go
to the snack shack upstairs.

431
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,770
You each must buy something different.

432
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,170
While the rep is doing
the mission without failing

433
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,000
the rest of the members who buy
five different objects will win.

434
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,200
[If the rep gives up, the relay ends.]

435
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,030
Who would like to pick a keyword?

436
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,850
- Yeah! Go!
- The keyword is?

437
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,310
Chair.

438
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:39,710
You have to do a mission

439
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,680
related with that word.

440
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,200
- Isn't it a pylon?
- No way...

441
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,630
[I remember the pain from that day...]

442
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,740
Jay... you do this one.

443
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,650
Is it something weird?

444
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,710
[I feel like I shouldn't
sit on this 'chair'...]

445
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,680
- You're important.
- Jay, now is your time.

446
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,140
Jay will be our team's rep.

447
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,650
[Mission rep, Jay Park.]
Then I'll go.

448
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,970
- Really?
- Ha Ha!

449
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,340
Is it Ha Ha?

450
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,170
Why?
Can't it be me?

451
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,140
Isn't it 1:0?
Comparing visuals.

452
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,030
What are you saying?

453
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,310
This is the mission for the reps.

454
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,080
Invisible chair.

455
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,850
Each rep will wear pants with sand paper

456
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,100
and be in a horseback riding position

457
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,340
above the balloon with
a book on their lap.

458
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,940
Before the rest of the members

459
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,940
buy their objects

460
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,340
if the book on the lap falls

461
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,480
or if you sit on the balloon

462
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,850
that team will fail.

463
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,370
You've seen my lower body.

464
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,450
[The definition of lower
body is Dream's daddy.]

465
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll do well, but just come quickly.

466
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,650
Everyone please go behind the desks.

467
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,030
You have to buy the objects
in the order I call out.

468
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,310
The objects you have to buy this round

469
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,110
are instant noodles

470
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,510
chopsticks

471
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,830
a can of tuna

472
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,650
chocolate

473
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,510
and water.

474
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,650
Memorize one each.

475
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,740
Ready, set...

476
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,540
Please get into position
when I blow the whistle.

477
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,140
[A teamwork mission with
the rep's lower body muscles]

478
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,460
[and the team members' quickness.]

479
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,170
[First mission, the electric chair.]

480
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,540
[Shove.]

481
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,850
[It's like a UFC match from the start.]

482
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,570
[Where did you learn such bad habits?]

483
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,030
Good job, Jessi!

484
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,650
I'm already so tired.

485
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,540
[Snack Shack Mad Max, Fury Hall.]

486
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,280
[The balloon will pop
at the slightest movement.]

487
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,170
Oh, good.

488
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,250
Please give me instant noodles!

489
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,800
Me first!

490
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,340
[Re-experiencing the
memories of snack shack.]

491
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,510
[Push.]
No!

492
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,230
[This is a competition.]

493
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,250
Keep it together, Jae Bum.

494
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,630
Hip-hop calves vs. Daddy calves.

495
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:43,000
[They are passing through the corner.]

496
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,110
Come on, Jessi!

497
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,800
[Baton pass, Jessi to Ji Won.]

498
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,830
Steal it!
[Stealing failed.]

499
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,370
[So close.]

500
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,570
[Ji Won is going to...]

501
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,740
[play dirty?]

502
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,000
[Kwang Soo, start!]

503
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,170
[I need a plan to close
the distance with Ji Won.]

504
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,630
Please give me some chopsticks!

505
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,110
[Ji Won received the chopsticks.]

506
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,030
[Grab.]

507
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,880
[Free hugs.]

508
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,740
[An eye for an eye,
a dirty game for a dirty game.]

509
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,940
This is unnecessary!
This is your loss, as well as mine!

510
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,880
[No, this is their loss.]

511
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,250
Do something!

512
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,680
- Jay, you got this!
- Just wait a little longer.

513
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Jae Bum!

514
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,770
This is harder than I thought.

515
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,230
- What are doing?
- What are you guys doing!

516
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,400
Kwang Soo!

517
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,080
Ji Won!

518
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,000
Good job!

519
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,250
Is it hard?
Oh my god.

520
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,030
You can't let him steal!
You can't!

521
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:08,340
[Who has the chopsticks?]

522
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,650
[He stole the chopsticks.]

523
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,310
Guys!

524
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,800
Oh no!

525
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,650
- Hurry up!
- Don't fool around!

526
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740

00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,750
[The gap is increasing again.]

704
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,710
See?
Gary is weak.

705
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,250
That's not it.
He was making it one by one.

706
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,910
[Popcorn artisan is upstairs!]

707
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,800
[Don't make me laugh!]

708
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,630
He was scooping popcorns one by one.

709
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,910
[Don't laugh!]
It's tiring!

710
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,170
Insecticide! Insecticide!

711
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,370
[The bouncy Grasshopper
vs. Dream's Father.]

712
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,800
Insecticide!

713
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,600
[While the hip-hop club
is still in the lead...]

714
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,200
[the masters are recovering.]

715
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:07,200
[The hip-hop Genius San E vs.
the athletic club's Ace Blank Ji]

716
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,340
Cooking oil!
Cooking oil!

717
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,230
[If the hip-hop clubs keeps
the lead, they can win!]

718
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,100
Cooking oil, please!

719
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,970
[San E increases the gap
and runs at full speed!]

720
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,050
- It's okay, Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo!

721
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,970
[Their cardiovascular endurance
have reached the limit.]

722
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,480
[San E to Verbal Jint.]

723
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,050
The last runner is Kim Jong Kook!

724
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,740
[Verbal Jint vs. Mr. Capable]

725
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,170
He's so slow!

726
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,430
[Verbal Jin is in the lead.]
It's so scary!

727
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,400
Out your head up!

728
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,830
Look up!

729
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,080
Just hold it for ten seconds!

730
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,570
- Wait a second!
- Just lean back!

731
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,740
It's good!

732
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,110
- Verbal Jint!
- Jong Kook!

733
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:13,090
[Who is the last runner
that comes first?]

734
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,850
[Mr. Capable is coming!]

735
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:25,770
[The athletic club turns
the table at the last minute.]

736
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:32,200
[The athletic club wins
at the Music Class.]

737
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,480
[Disappointed]

738
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,550
How can you lose?

739
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,030
[Crime reconstruction]
You can take it out yourself.

740
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,630
[The moment he grabbed one,
Mr. Capable caught him.]

741
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,230
[With the other hand,
he grabbed an ice cream!]

742
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,400
[He deserved to be Fumble Jint...]

743
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,320
[He doesn't have speed nor strength...]

744
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,770
[Verbal Jin is all wet.]

745
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,370
We had to take the ice cream
from the freezer.

746
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,720
I've seen people who are slow.
But he made me scared!

747
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,000
Therefore, the athletic club wins!

748
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,250
It's a complete defeat!

749
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,600
Every time I come on 'Running Man,'
I lose because I'm on your team.

750
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,450
It's not my fault!

751
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,260
It's Verbal...
we almost won but he ruined it!

752
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,310
[Thanks to Verbal Jin,
they had a good music class.]

753
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,520
The athletic club, please come forward.

754
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,230
[Picking out the cards]

755
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,680
Same as before, you will
pick one from three to six.

756
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,350
You need to show me.

757
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,970
[The first number card]

758
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,510
[The second number card]

759
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,140
[The first sign card]

760
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,740
[The second sign card]

761
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,630
At least we need to pick good ones.

762
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,250
[The first number card]

763
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,200
[The second number card]

764
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,600
[What about the sign card?]

765
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,260
[The first sign card]
Wow!

766
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,770
Please pick another one.
[The second sign card]

767
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,110
Even though we lost the game,
during this mission...

768
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,280
Jae Bum was really funny.

769
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,600
Verbal... you're like a new discovery!

770
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,000
You're the slowest person
in the entertainment business.

771
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,660
Let the viewers judge,
why are you...

772
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,200
Get out if you're not in my team!

773
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,150
[He's dissing him properly
as the captain of the hip-hop club.]

774
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,800
You're a member of the athletic...

775
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
[Summoned forcefully]
Record this!

776
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,400
You need to record this!
[Otherwise, I'm dead!]

777
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,940
- Let's see Jay's b-boying!
- Let's do that!

778
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,200
[Jay's break-dance time!]
This is a rare chance for us!

779
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,400
I'll start and...

780
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,570
<i>Everybody dance now!</i>

781
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:20,480
San E can do beat boxing, right?

782
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,750
[Okay, start the music!]

783
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,600
[It's show time!]

784
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,150
[The windmill!]

785
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,600
[Jay Park is awesome!]

786
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,200
[Freeze]
[The perfect finish!]

787
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,080
Come on!
Come on!

788
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,660
[Who's going to challenge?]

789
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,000
[Roar!]

790
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,680
[I only know boxing moves!]

791
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,970
[He is the captain of
the athletic club indeed!]

792
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,970
Verbal!
Verbal!

793
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,850
[He's not very athletic,
but his Hip-Hop spirit...]

794
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,710
[Never mind.]
What are you doing?

795
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,000
How can you break
the mood like that?

796
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,970
Verbal Jint just crushed the mood again!

797
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,030
[He's still practicing.]

798
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,000
Just put down the cup already!
Stop it!

799
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,890
He'll be the master of
cup sucking in a year.

800
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,860
He will be preforming in the street.

801
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,480
On his album cover!

802
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,570
He might wear the cup
like a gas mask!

803
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,920
[Verbal Jint: You look nice.]

804
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,290
[Verbal Jint: You look suffocating.]
He won't need a mask.

805
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,950
Let's go!
[Let's go to third period!]

806
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,200
[The hip-hop club is in a crisis.]

807
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,720
[Will they be able to counterattack?]

808
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,060
[The acquired cards
after second period.]

809
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,770
[The last game before
the final mission on the roof!]

810
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,570
[What will be the game
they will play at the library?]

811
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,560
[You're stronger than yesterday.]

812
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,230
[The third period: free time]
Why did they put the mats on the floor?

813
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,510
You shouldn't run the games.
That's unfair.

814
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,260
It's good to be on a winning streak.

815
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,600
San E, Verbal, and Jae Bum...

816
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,060
Especially, Verbal looks
very disappointed.

817
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,880
He was highly motivated at first...

818
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,660
Look at San E.
He removed all his accessories.

819
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,550
They are useless.

820
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,880
This time, we will pick
the game for you.

821
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,310
The first game you will play is...

822
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,800
you probably know this game.

823
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,940
'The Stationery Throw.'

824
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,630
What?
What do you mean?

825
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,940
- Stationery.
- What is stationery?

826
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,290
It's fancy.
[He remembers fancy stationery shops.]

827
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,140
You're so old!

828
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,950
One representing member
from each team

829
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,510
will come out and wear a backpack.

830
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,880
Run to the line and bend your waist

831
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,370
to throw the stationery
inside the backpack.

832
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,630
We're not throwing them with hand
but bending our waist?

833
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,080
You're good at it.

834
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,770
We'll pick Kwang Soo.

835
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,770
[Powerful]
He's really good.

836
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,000
[Kwang Soo vs. San E]
What about you?

837
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,120
Good!
[The whole body rolling attack!]

838
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,970
He's good!

839
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,800
- Happy new year!
- Say good night.

840
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,310
Good night!

841
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,150
[You need to bend your waist
as if you make a deep bow.]

842
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,090
[The great humiliation]
[And his head is in the bag.]

843
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,150
Can you see?

844
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,600
- What was that?
- Did you see it?

845
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,430
You saw how I do it?

846
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,430
[Will Kwang Soo and San E
be able to do it properly?]

847
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,650
San E, let's go!

848
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,630
['The Stationery Throw,' 1st round]

849
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,750
Deux used to wear this kind of backpack.

850
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,910
Don't step on the line!

851
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,740
- Are you ready?
- Go!

852
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,950
You don't need to do it too hard.

853
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,290
[The future of the hip-hop
club is on this backpack!]

854
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,770
[Home Run!]

855
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,030
[The perfect bounce!]

856
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,910
[San E, nice shot!]

857
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,950
That was nice!

858
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,400
[It's an out-of-the-park homer.]
That's what he threw?

859
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,970
- That was nice!
- That's really far.

860
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:03,000
You can do it!
[How can I win...]

861
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,030
[Smile]

862
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,830
Start if you're ready.

863
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,890
- Kwang Soo, come on!
- Ready!

864
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,230
- Fight, fight!
- Set!

865
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,310
[Fly, fly away!]

866
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,650
We won!

867
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,430
[Giraffe's dramatic grand slam!]

868
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,140
He just threw it with hand.

869
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,340
[He's doubting.]
Did Kwang Soo throw it?

870
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,170
Check the camera now.

871
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,720
There's no way only one pen
could go that far.

872
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,370
It doesn't make any sense!

873
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,370
Don't you understand what bounce is?

874
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm sure he threw it with his hand.

875
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,970
Of course, he threw it.

876
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,200
[He shut his eyes tight...]

877
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,150
[he holds the marker
in a scorpion-like position.]

878
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,060
[Then he casually throws the pen.]

879
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,550
[Then he acts like he's innocent.]

880
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,790
He must have done it.

881
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,630
[The fraud is exposed.]
I'm so sorry!

882
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,310
[What if you weren't caught.
Is saying sorry enough?]

883
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,450
- I'm so sorry!
- It's okay!

884
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,170
It's my fault!
I'm sorry.

885
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,940
[The hip-hop club gets one point.]

886
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,740
[The athletic club is disqualified.]

887
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,090
- Show us, Kwang Soo.
- Okay, I'll be serious this time.

888
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,200
Lets' go, let's go!

889
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,200
- It looks perfect.
- Let's go!

890
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,110
[No more dirty tricks...]

891
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,770
[I will reverse the game by fair play!]

892
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,830
Excuse me, Director...

893
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,050
[Sudden stop!]

894
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,480
[You need to experience the same.]

895
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,400
I'm sure I could have
thrown it really far!

896
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,910
All of a sudden, I thought about
something to tell to him.

897
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,650
- You just broke his concentration.
- I'm really sorry.

898
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,050
[I see how it is...]

899
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,080
Good luck, Lee Kwang Soo!

900
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,460
Ready!

901
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,850
[He hit his own face!]

902
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:31,540
It's pretty far!

903
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,090
- Did you get hit?
- I got a knee kick.

904
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,800
I saw stars!

905
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,120
- I really saw stars!
- At least, it went pretty far.

906
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,110
This game is too dangerous!

907
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,880
This game is not dangerous.

908
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,170
It's not supposed to be dangerous.

909
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,710
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

910
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:59,030
If San E throws it further than that,
the hip-hop club wins the first game.

911
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,910
End this game, San E!

912
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,630
If you start talking...

913
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,170
- Stop it!
- What are you planning to do?

914
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,510
[Pretending and denying]
What did we do?

915
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,430
I'm not going to stand
and watch this time.

916
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,120
- San E, just do it.
- Do it even if they block you.

917
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,320
[The athletic club,
breaks into the field.]

918
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,510
What was that?

919
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,830
It's all for fun!

920
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,370
Do you think it's funny?

921
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,970
[A mud fight begins.]

922
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,490
[What do I do...]

923
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:47,480
That's how you play this?
[This is a war!]

924
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,090
[Scorpion Kwang Soo]
[His combat power increases.]

925
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,180
San E was kicking at the back.

926
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,480
Because he doesn't want to lose.

927
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,920
Don't just stand still.

928
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,400
Who was standing by?

929
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,650
Jae Bum, you didn't move...
Verbal...

930
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,970
- I'm not going to be standing here.
- You two are too timid today!

931
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,950
I'm timid today.

932
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,400
I didn't do anything!

933
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,450
What do you mean you're timid?

934
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,320
- What do you think timid means?

935
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,910
You don't have to be greedy about it.

936
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,850
Why do you want to be timid?

937
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,950
- What does timid means?
- You don't even know what it means.

938
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,000
I don't care!
[So she didn't know what it means.]

939
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,830
[She wants to be part of it.]

940
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,950
I'll see how you do, Jae Bum and Verbal.

941
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,280
Because we were in a fight!

942
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,080
So we can start acting up now?

943
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,940
No, we can't.

944
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,860
- We can block them though.
- I'm afraid you will cause a trouble.

945
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,280
Just stay calm, Verbal.

946
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,920
It's always the quiet ones.

947
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,230
Verbal, are you usually this quiet?

948
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,800
- Let's resume the game.
- Even if they block you, keep going!

949
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,430
- Really?
- Are you really going to?

950
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,310
- Let's go!
- Just do it!

951
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:10,230
Players should not...

952
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,030
[Rolling]

953
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,400
[It's an out-of-the-park homer again!]

954
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,120
That's right!
[San E's diving was rewarded.]

955
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,910
[San E's pen went further
than Kwang Soo's pen.]

956
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:35,230
This time, the hip-hop club wins.

957
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:40,510
It's just one game.

958
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,320
This time, you will play
'Indoor Slipper Ping-Pong.'

959
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,480
[Big-nose and Gary win at
'Indoor Slipper Ping-Pong.']

960
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,890
[During the free time,
score two points first!]

961
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,970
The game you're going to
play is 'Open the Book.'

962
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,800
You probably know this game.

963
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,320
One member from each team
comes out and opens the book.

964
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:12,030
If you see more people on the
opened pages than your opponent

965
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,660
It'll be lucky to have a history book.

966
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,510
[I should be brave!]

967
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,920
These are the books we will give you.
They're the same books.

968
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,630
Are there pages with no people?

969
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,940
Yes, and that'll count as 0.

970
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,860
Don't just ask,
'Are there pages with no people?'

971
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,770
Please do well on the game!

972
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:37,800
- You sound like Lee Sun Gyun.
- You only ask, you don't act!

973
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,970
I'll try and get the page
with the most people.

974
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,280
He drives me crazy.

975
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,060
He will impersonate him from now on.

976
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,460
The face has to show
eyes, nose, and mouth.

977
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,490
You can't lose, Ha Ha.
We need to get to the finals.

978
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,450
What are you looking at?

979
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,140
I can't see anything.

980
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,490
- This is how he plays it.
- Yes, this is how I play it.

981
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,000
Do you want to see how I play?

982
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,030
[He could go against the rules.]

983
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,570
These two have quick wits.

984
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,950
[Ha Ha will go first.]
One, two, three!

985
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,690
One, two, three, four, five,
and six!

986
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:32,430
- I think she's pregnant.
- And it's twins!

987
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,680
[Ji Won's turn.]

988
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,350
[He has to get more than six people.]

989
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,090
- One, two, three.
- Four people!

990
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,890
This is a rabbit.

991
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,170
[Ji Won gets three people.]

992
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,370
- Ha Ha is good at this kind of game.
- Just finish him, Jint.

993
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,340
Verbal, you need to win.

994
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,100

When will I be able to win over someone

graduated from
Seoul National University?

997
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,600
Is it going to be today?

998
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,200
[The way he grabs the book
is out of ordinary.]

999
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,550
- He's good at handling books.
- He graduated the law school.

1000
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:17,200
Verbal read a lot of books.

1001
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,290
It's okay, he graduated low school
but you graduated high school.

I love school!

inside the book...]

- That's great!

- Not at this game.

It's your turn, San E.

00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,410
[Gary vs. San E]
Just one more!

1046
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,570
If they defeat San E,
they will win the third period.

1047
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,540
[Relaxed]

1048
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,770
Good luck, San E!

1049
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:04,140
- Going, going, gone!
- And I got it!

1050
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,680
[Jackpot!]

1051
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,480
- They're not human.
- We can't see their faces.

1052
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,800
Jessi and Ji Won,
you need to let the viewers see this.

1053
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,510
Go home and watch it later!

1054
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,880
We're timid, what's wrong?

1055
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,680
But I'm curious!

1056
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:32,170
['Open the Book,' the fourth round]
[Gary: eight people]

1057
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,510
- It's eight people.
- That's a lot.

1058
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,680
We most likely won.

1059
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,970
Hope you get nine people...

1060
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,450
[Please...]

Don't distract him.

1062
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,280
He did it!

1063
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,630
[He catches a big fish!]

1064
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:58,850
We won!

1065
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:03,450
This can't be...

1066
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,090
[The hip-hop club recovers!]

1067
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,940
[It's definitely more
than nine people.]

1068
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,770
- Did you switch the book?
- Of course, I did.

1069
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,170
- This is the last round.
- Song Ji Hyo!

1070
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,400
I'm afraid of her.

1071
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,720
[You need to win this round
in order to pick good cards!]

1072
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,120
I know this is the last round,
but stay back.

1073

[Will the hip-hop club's heart
San E be able to win?]

1074

- Yes, it's your turn.

1075

[The teams' futures depend
on how well Ji Hyo does it.]

- Song Ji Hyo!
- She's so lucky!

1078
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,600
[Everyone in the picture is looking
straight and showing their faces.]

1079
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,260
16 people.

1080
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,370
[Lots of pressure]
Is that a record?

1081
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,290
San E, open the same page
or else you'll die.

1082
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:24,860
- Wasn't that 15 people?
- There was a page with 30 people.

1083
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:29,340
- Ready!
- San E!

1084
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:35,110
[Who will be...]

1085
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,880
[the final winner?]

1086
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,890
One, two, three!

1087
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,450
[Huh?]
[This page is...]

1088
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:50,320
The man with a mask again!

1089

[The unclimbable fence of the mask]

- Amazing!

[Relaxed]

We did pretty well.

during the third period.]

among 3, 4, 5, and 6.]

Up right, I have a good feeling.

1109
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,800
This is what Verbal Jint picked.

1110
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,430
Why?

It's an outdoor film set!

1119
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,480
You are finally at the roof.

1120
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,650
The game to see who
the best bluffer really is

1121
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,800
is a card fight.

1122
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,800
We have collected six number cards

1123
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,630
and six sign cards.

1124
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:11,190
Each player will pick one
number card and one sign card.

1125
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,630
Come up with the cards.

1126
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:16,170
First, you will flip the number card.

1127
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:20,970
Then you will flip the sign card
at the signal.

1128
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:25,030
The one with the bigger number wins.

1129
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,680
It's time to bluff.

1130
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,070
We need to pretend.

1131
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,170
The numbers that the
hip-hop club have are...

1132
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:37,660
one, one, two

1133
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,510
- Oh no!
- Three

1134
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:43,080
three, and four.

1135
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,540
1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4.

1136
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,460
And we're not going to
tell you the sign cards.

1137
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,340
But we have a brain,
graduated from Seoul University.

1138
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,720
These are the numbers that
the athletic club has.

1139
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:00,650
Three, three, four,
five, five, and five.

1140
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:03,850
But they're not to be
compared with us!

1141
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,310
3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5.
Now you can make combinations.

1142
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,400
[The chances are against us...]

1143
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:15,260
[What combinations will they make?]

1144
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,510
Listen, they don't really have choices.

1145
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,880
One and one, they're useless.

1146
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,760
I think they will use
bigger numbers in a row.

1147
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,200
We can win with our small numbers, too.

1148
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,470
It's easy for us to win.

1149
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:33,430
We will win when both teams
put useless cards.

1150
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,120
I think they will use
the bigger cards at the end.

1151
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,200
It'll be good for us if they use up
the big cards in the beginning.

1152
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,570
We don't need to use
big cards in the beginning.

1153
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:48,970
Let's use the small cards first
then we will win the rest.

1154
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,430
We might even win the first one, too.

1155
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,540
- We need to lose first.
- At once?

1156
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:00,680
We need to guess
what they will use first.

1157
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,340
Pardon me, but I'm pretty sure
they're in their glory now.

1158
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:10,850
I think they will keep
the biggest cards till the end.

1159
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,400
So they can win the game at the end.

1160
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,650
I guess they won't use
big numbers in the beginning.

1161
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,220
It's unfavorable for us,
so we need to take the bet.

1162
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,230
Fortunately, we only have
two negatives.

1163
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,250
We have pretty good sign cards.

1164
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,680
We have a decided advantage.

1165
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,230
- It's already decided.
- We are really smart.

1166
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,570

01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,510

1169
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,410
You're having a hard time.

1170
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,650
We couldn't win even once!

1171
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,170
Do you think you will win this?

1172
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,000
Maybe we will!

1173
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,220
Ji Won will be the first player.

1174
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,060
Our first player is Jong Kook.

1175
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,660
Put the cards close to each other.

1176
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:12,030
For victory, we need to win four times.

1177
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:15,150
Or 3 wins and 1 tie.

1178
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,250
We'll follow our plan!

1179
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:25,060
- We will win!
- Crush them!

One, two, three!

1185

Just as we expected!

1186
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:51,910
This is one of the big numbers for you!

1187
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:56,340
Why did you use up the big one?

1188
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:00,170
- It's not one but two?
- It hurts me.

1189
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,030
You never know.

1190
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,460
I think they put a useless card.

- Jessi.
- This is an amazing battle of wits!

1202

We'll start the third round.

1213
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,230
- Jay Park and Ha Ha.
- Flip the blue card.

1214
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:57,260
One, two, three!

1215
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,680
[Both teams revealed
the highest numbers.]

1216
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,030
[Now, it's the sign card.]

1217
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:12,200
Yeah!

1218
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,830
It would have been better if we
switched the second and third round.

1219
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,750
What are you going to do now?

1220
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:27,280
They are playing a safe game.
They'll keep the big ones.

1221
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,310
We should have won one more.

1222
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,920
[There must be a solution.]

1223
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,320
[Gary vs. Jae Suk]
Flipping the blue card...

1224
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,430
One, two, three!

1225
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:45,570
[Very big difference]

1226
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,450
We know it's five.

1227
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:50,910
[Relaxed]
The sign card, one, two, three!

1228
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,800
[Revealing the sign card]

1229
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:58,200
[A facile victory]
What a big difference!

1230
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,050
[Suk Jin vs. San E]
Please make me win!

1231
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,770
Starting with the number card,
one, two, three!

1232
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,830
I knew it!

1233
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:12,430
- We're going to take the bet now.
- The sign card, one, two, three!

1234
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,540
[Maybe they will able to reverse...]

1235
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,400
[What do we expect?]

1236
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,860
[Three-peat!]

1237
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,520
- It's annoying.
- This is fun!

1238
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,520
[Even the last card is favorable
for the athletic Club.]

1239
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,260
[Our plan will be successful!]
We're great!

1240
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,510
They are in the palm of our hand!

1241
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,540
This is the last round!

1242
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,290
We won.

1243
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:46,000
Kwang Soo will play.

1244
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,710
Verbal!

1245
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:51,250
- Really?
- A battle between an fool and a genius.

1246
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,030
What are you talking about?
Who's dumb?

1247
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,350
We have no choice.

1248
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:04,280
It'll be a miracle if we win.

1249
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,480
[We're giving our all.]

1250
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,770
Flip the blue card, first.
One, two, three!

1251
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:18,480
We did it!

1252
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,030
If we win, we'll be tied.

1253
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,970
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

1254
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,060
[I won't let you win that easily.]

1255
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,400
The sign card, one, two, three!

1256
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,860
[Will it be an easy victory?]

1257
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,740
[Or will it be a draw?]

1258
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,770
[The card has been flipped.]

1259
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,400
[The hip-hop club's last victory!]

1260
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,890
[Huh?]
[What is it?]

1261
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,950
[They used the multiplying card
at the end!]

1262
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:13,450
[The card fight ends in draw.]

1263
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:18,370
- Hey!
- What do we do?

1264
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,850
[Puffed up]

1265
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,750
Start using your brain from now on!

1266
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,510
The game is a tie now.

1267
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:26,480
We'll use the sudden death method.

1268
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,510
The athletic club won more games,
pick an additional sign card first.

1269
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,260
They are exactly same sets.

1270
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,170
You will use one of the number card
you already have.

1271
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:39,570
Make a combination with
this new sign card.

1272
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:43,880
Who wants to draw the last card?

1273
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,400
It all depend on this card.

1274
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,600
- And Ji Hyo is sitting there.
- She's really lucky!

1275
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,900
- I did my best today.
- Yes, you did.

1276
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,250
You did it, Ji Hyo!

1277
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,460
Okay, very good!

1278
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,230
[We won't lose so easily.
This is competition...]

1279
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:03,830
[Jessi picks the last sign card.]

1280
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:05,920
We have no other chances.
It's our destiny!

1281
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,570
We did our best.

1282
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,950
We did our best, too.

1283
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,000
We'll flip the sign card now.

1284
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,050
- Ji Hyo, flip it.
- Jessi, go ahead.

1285
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,710
Why me?

1286
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,770
- Ji Hyo!
- Please!

1287
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,260
[1,000 percent nerve-racking!]

1288
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,370
[I'm the goddess of fortune.]

1289
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,600
[Please...]

1290
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:39,150
One, two, three!
[The last sign cards reveal!]

1291
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,690
[Half a second to the ultimate victory!]

1292
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,570
[The last cards that will decide
the two teams' fortune!]

1293
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,200
[They picked the same card!]

1294
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,800
Wow!

1295
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,230
[How could it be!]

1296
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,030
[What an electrifying victory!]

1297
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,430
[We missed it.]
Amazing!

1298
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,070
We were close...

1299
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:18,000
[Who knew they would have
picked the same card!]

1300
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,170
It's just one point!

1301
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:25,850
We did what we could.

1302
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:28,830
[The goddess of fortune
blessed the athletic club.]

1303
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:32,800
- Here is the prize for the winner.
- Wow, it's a golden snapback!

1304
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,400
The golden badge is attached!

1305
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,990
It's very stylish.

1306
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:43,570
I still can't believe
we picked the same card!

1307
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,540
[Bragging]

1308
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,910
The hip-hop club should
have received this prize.

1309
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,600
Thank you for playing with us.

1310
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,080
Jae Bum, you've worked so hard.

1311
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,940
Normally, guests on variety shows
appear to promote their albums.

1312
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:01,230
'Running Man' doesn't give us
any opportunities to do that.

1313
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,400
From the beginning, we start fighting.

1314
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,880
- Why don't you promote yourself?
- It's okay.

1315
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,400
Many people know me.

1316
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,630
[He's bluffing now that
the race is over.]

1317
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:19,150
It's the first time for me to
come on a physical variety show.

1318
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:24,280
I tried my best...
but I'm so sorry.

1319
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,400
From the beginning to the end,
he says sorry.

1320
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,310
He keeps saying sorry.

1321
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,370
I think I will practice cup suction
when I get home.

1322
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,150
Thank you for your hard work!
