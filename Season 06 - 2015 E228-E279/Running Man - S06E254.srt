Manager Hyung Chul.]

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,510
Why doesn't it work for me?

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,110
I think this is broken!
It doesn't work!

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,860
[Repeated mistakes on Ha Ha's team.]

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,340
Why doesn't mine work?

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,880
This broke.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,880
How come yours works
but mine doesn't!

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,280
Wear this and play!

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,540
I'm wearing sunglasses,
so you have to wear this!

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,140

An enormous fellow has appeared.

[A smile of satisfaction
towards something...]

34
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,650
It's been a while since
I've seen such a fellow.

that Ha Ha received.]

42

That's awesome!

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,170

[Then, they disappear!]

53
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,510
[That's the end of a relaxing break.]

54
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,390
[If the response is a
yes, they disappear]

55
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,280
Yes, no?
Yes!

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,910
[Instantaneously!]

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,930
[All the 'Running Man' members vanished!]

58

60
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,740

[Hyo Yeon]

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,790
[Girls Generation are planning a
comeback in a year and five months.]

70
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,200
[They've never come on 'Running Man'
with the whole group before!]

71
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,020
[A leisurely time at the salon.]

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,650
[I'm becoming prettier.]

73
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,450
[Aren't you too girly?]

74
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,170
[Seo Hyun also got an invitation?]

75
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,250
What is this?
[She clicked yes.]

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,960
[Seo Hyun vanished, too!]

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600

[Tae Yeon found the
invitation as well!]

79
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,050
[She also vanished.]

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
What is happening!

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,030
[Sunny disappears in a flash.]

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,540
[Now everyone is disappearing
like dominoes...]

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,110
[Sunny, Yoona, Tiffany,
Yuri one after another!]

84
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,280
[Soo Young is dozing off.]

85
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,620
[Nobody's here?]
Where did they go?

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,280
[She checks the
invitation half-asleep.]

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280
[Did everyone go here?]

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,140
[Girls Generation
accepted the invitation!]

89
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,140
[Where did the 'Running Man' members
and Girls Generation vanish off to?]

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,540
[Welcome to Game World!]

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,650
How long has it been since
we last saw Girls Generation?

92
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,170
[The first time]
Welcome back!

93
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,080
[They came as a whole!]
Thank you!

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,480
Girls Generation!

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,970
But more than anything

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,220
- I heard it's Tiffany's first time.
- Soo Young, too!

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,800
- It's Soo Young's first time.
- She didn't come last time.

98
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
It's almost like the
year-end awards ceremony!

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,620
They don't know anything
about the mud flat!

100
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,370
[A standard mud flat photo shoot.]
It can be seriously physical...

101
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,820
[Tremble, tremble]

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,740
In my opinion, Sunny knows
the least about mud flats.

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,620
- Why?
- Her clothes...

104
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,970
She's in Miami!

105
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,800
It'll take forever to dig out
the dirt in your belly button.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,570
Are these the teams?
In the same color?

107
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,850
Yes.

108
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,540
Yuri and Tiffany saw my shirt

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,450
and they cursed.

110
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,650
[I can relate.]

111
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,110
Why can't Yoona and
Soo Young look at Gary?

112
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,450
Are you shy?

113
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,620
[He's so charming...]
He's a lump of charm!

114
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,250
- That was smooth, Gary.
- I can't help but look...

115
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,340
Everyone has entered
into the game world.

116
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,620
In order to go back to the real world

117
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,020
you must clear all the
missions in the game world.

118
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,740
[Every time a team wins the
interim mission, you will receive]

119
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,420
[a hint exchange ticket that is
beneficial at the final mission.]

120
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,710
Only one team can return
to the real world.

121
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,800
Basically, you don't get to go home.

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,250
I don't want to go back today.

123
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,200
This is the location
for the first game.

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,400
The first game is...
[What game will it be...]

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,970
- You know the game 'Pac-Man,' right?
- Yes!

126
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,480
- 'Pac-Man'!
- I used to play it when I was young!

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,770
[A classic game, 'Pac-Man.']

128
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,050
If you see from above, the set
is prepared like a 'Pac-Man' game.

129
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,440
Of the five teams,
one team will go against the rest.

130
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,450
And the rest of the teams
must guard the gateway.

131
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,480
Oh, like the children's game?

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,370
If you go over there, you will see

133
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,450
the suspension bridge.
The defense team stays at the bottom.

134
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,420
The challenge team must get
through and cross the bridge.

135
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,850
You can help the member
who is crossing.

136
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,710
In the next one
[Palm strike zone.]

137
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,800
one representative has
to knock everyone down.

138
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
After that, at the third gate

139
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,090
[One-legged fight zone.]

140
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,880
All three members must do
a one-legged fight.

141
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,480
The challenge team can get up
even if they fall and retry.

142
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,200
This is the last one.
[Steal the sock zone.]

143
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,570
One person on defense
will be wearing a sock.

144
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,310
You have to take that sock off.

145
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,620
We will time you from the
moment you start and finish.

146
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,020
We will give hints to the top two
teams who have the shortest record.

147
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,650
[First challenge Team Yellow,
Gary, Yoona, Soo Young.]

148
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,220
Take it easy.

149
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,200
- Do I look weird?
- Just don't throw us, please.

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,800
Soo Young, why are you
trying to look nice?

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,860
This is a mud flat!

152
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,540
This is my first time,
of course I have to look nice!

153
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,800
Okay!
[You don't know anything about women.]

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,480
[Gate Two defense, Team Blue.]
Can Gary be their rep?

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,940
- Why?
- He looks easy to deal with.

156
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,880
Gary?
Who's on Gary's team?

157
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,950
Yoona and Soo Young.

158
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,340
- Who's stronger, Yoona or Soo Young?
- Yoona's the strongest out of all.

159
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,310
I'm going to do my best today!

160
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,000
Good luck!

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,080
- Soo Young, do well!
- Okay, good luck!

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,280
[First mission, 'Pac-Man' game.]
Ready, start!

163
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,740
Our enemy is coming!

164
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,190
[Team Yellow is running towards
the first gate, the suspension bridge.]

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,880
[Soo Young is very energetic on her
first appearance on 'Running Man.'

166
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,420
[Fall]

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,220
Why did you fall?

168
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,620
[Gary crosses the bridge.]

169
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,310
[Let's just get through Jong Kook...]

170
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:24,140
[If I get through Jong Kook,
all that's left are two delicate girls...]

171
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,000
[Give us your pants, you'll pass!]
Gary, good luck!

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,400
[Everyone wants
a piece of... his clothes.]

173
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,200
[They look like girls,
but they act like old ladies.]

174
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,140
- Gary, your pants!
- Hurry and come!

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,450
[The member that succeeds can

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,710
- The first gate is the most dangerous.
- The first gate.

349
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,200
I think if you do something wrong,
you're gonna end up like Suk Jin.

350
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,850
If we don't watch out,
Kwang Soo and I will get caught

351
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,250
and we'll end up like Suk Jin.

352
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,340
- We just need to get through Gate One.
- Yeah, just this one.

353
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,420
- Last race, get ready!
- Let's go, one, two

354
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,770
three, good luck!

355
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,600
[Round Five of 'Pac-Man,' start!]

356
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,450
[Tempered tailbone]

357
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,250
- Charge!
- Bring it on!

358
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,740
Come on!
I'm not letting anyone through!

359
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,110
- Let Hyo Yeon pass.
- Hyo Yeon, you can go.

360
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,110
[Scared]

361
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,200
[Attack]

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,020
[It's about time to get punished!]

363
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,970
[Shall we start?]

364
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,910
Sunny!
Hey!

365
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,480
[It's clothe-collecting season.]

366
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,280
Come on, come on!

367
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,310
[Fourth gate, steal my sock zone.
What is Team Orange up to?]

368
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,080
We're going to bury the sock.

369
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,340
That's a good idea!

370
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,000
They're so funny!

371
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,880
I think we should all bury our feet
so that they don't know who has it.

372
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,760
There's time, right?
[But none of you can move.]

373
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,340
Where are you going?
[One, two!]

374
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,000
[Grasshopper and Hyo Yeon
pass the bridge.]

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,200
- You can't go!
- Kwang Soo, hurry up!

376
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
- What are you doing!
- Just come!

377
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,970
[Fall]

378
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,350
Just come!
[A big slide.]

379
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,340
[Hesitantly puts his
hand in his pants.]

380
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,820
Hurry!
Hurry and go up!

381
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,250
[Ah... I miss my mom...]

382
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,620
Catch Kwang Soo!

383
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,690
He looks like...

384
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,000
someone who came for a
whole-body mud pack.

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,530
- Hurry up!
- Kwang Soo!

386
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,370
- Hurry up.
- Just step on me, hurry up.

387
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,680
Go, oww!

[Slap]

390
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,570
Kwang Soo, your legs!
Legs!

391
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,080
- Sunny!
- We did it!

392
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,480
[Kwang Soo passed the
suspension bridge.]

393
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
[Beard man, who are you?]

394
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,720
[Team Green is heading to Gate Two.]

395

Paper human Tae Yeon.]

Go away Seo Hyun!

Seo Hyun!
[Fall]

402
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,410
[Playing hard to get genius, Seo Hyun.]

403
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,310
- Nothing's going my way!
- One, two, three!

404
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,710
[Strike]

405
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,050

thanks to Hyo Yeon's help.]

[He became a marionette.]

410
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,940
It's three versus one!

Damn it!
[Punch]

412
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,810
You're so frustrating!

413
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,080
[There's no tomorrow!]

414
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,750
Kwang Soo, pull me out.

415
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,140
[Switch players]

[After Gate Two, they finished
the one-legged race in a flash.]

[The only thing left
is the fourth gate.]

423
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,110
Where is it?

424
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,060
[All the team members
have buried feet.]

425
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,980
You don't know where it is!
Where could it be?

426
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
It's here!

427
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,920
- No!
- Defend Yuri!

428
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,300
[They might beat Team Orange's score.]
Left foot!

429

What is this?
Where is this?

434
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,420
This is a towel!

435
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,160
Yuri block them!
[The sock is on Tiffany's foot.]

436
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,490
Grab Jae Suk!

437
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:03,700
- Are you crazy?
- Is this funny to you?

438
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,270
[What are you doing?]

439
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,240
What is this!

440
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,100
[You should do at least
this much in a mud flat.]

441
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,410
[The mud flat is alive.]

442
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,510
[Is it Girls Generation or
the prehistoric generation...]

443
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,820
[Let's go to it Grasshopper, too.]

444
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,820
Jae Suk, what's with
the color of your underwear?

445
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,420
What is this!

446
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,560
[Orange boy...]

447
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,700
[Blow]

448
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,900
[Team Green is eliminated
after running out of time.]

449
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,440
Why does this happen every
time I wear orange underwear?

450
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,770
[The curse of the orange underwear.]

451
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,040
People must think
I have no other underwear!

452
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,180
We can't go all the way over there!

453
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,120
- Just stay where you are!
- Okay!

454
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,230
I'll announce them!

455
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,970
[Team Yellow: 1st, Team Orange: 2nd]
[Team Pink: 3rd]

456
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,620
[Team Green: disqualified]
[Team Blue disqualified.]

457
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,170
[Only the top two teams get...]

458
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,570
[the beneficial hint exchange ticket.]

459
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,340
[Angry, angry]

460
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,110
You...

461
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,480
I won't let this go!

462
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,480
It's no joke!

463
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,650
[Everyone's combat skills rose.]

464
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm not letting this go!

465
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,970
I'm not joking!

466
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,220
Honestly...

467
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
I can't believe...

468
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,000
- They stripped us like that?
- It wasn't even underwater.

469
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,020
And also

470
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,280
why do I also get stripped when
I'm wearing orange underwear?

471
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,800
When I was picking it out today,
I thought... now way.

472
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,770
Your orange underwear has been on
the show more than most guests.

473
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,200
It had a lot of appearances.

474
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,080
People will misunderstand...
that I only have one underwear...

475
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,200
I'll buy you some on your birthday.

476
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,000
I have many!

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,650
I have the most in my neighborhood!

478
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,540
Why do you mean neighborhood?

479
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,200
But we've already used up so
much energy on the first mission...

480
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,220
What do we do?
Do you still try hard?

481
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,080
But when filming starts,
everyone tries right?

482
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,680
- The competitiveness comes out again.
- Yeah.

483
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,540
But I'm kind of slow at running.

484
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,450
That's okay, I don't think
we'll be running.

485
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,850
That's a relief.

486
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,400
Did you just act cute?

487
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,480
Were you showing your cute side?

488
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,970
Guys misunderstand.

489
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,600
- How?
- Guys think you're doing it to them.

490
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,450
Oh, really?

491
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,370
Guys act like they're inattentive

492
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,940
but they think about it at home.

493
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,340
- Really?
- Before they go to sleep, he thinks...

494
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,540
Why did she say
'that's a relief' to me?

495
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,650
You know what it is, right?

496
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,970
Do they really do that?
Wow.

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,310
- What is this?
- It's a video game!

498
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,710
- The bugs are a part of nature.
- Gary!

499
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,050
They taught me.

500
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,080
Yoona is teaching Gary how to
gain popularity by women.

501
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm learning.

502
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,970
Tell us, too!

503
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,420
When we were eating,
Kwang Soo ordered a dish for Ji Hyo...

504
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,170
He didn't order it.
He took some of what we were eating

505
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,310
so we thought Kwang Soo
was going to eat it

506
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,020
- but he put it in front of Ji Hyo.
- Without saying anything.

507
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,420
Because of that,
they love Kwang Soo now.

508
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,480
[That's nothing...]
A gentleman!

509
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,170
- Kwang Soo does that on purpose.
- What are you saying!

510
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,280
He does that for you to see!

511
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,450
[Was that what it was?]

512
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,280
[Gary still shoos
the insects for them.]

513
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,450
Those guys say dogs
are cute in front of women.

514
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,940
[They become an animal lover
only in front of women.]

515
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,970
Mind your own business
and get a girlfriend!

516
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,220
There are a lot of guys like that.

517
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,110
[Scream]
Wait, stay still.

518
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,400
That's not manly, right?

519
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,740
- He's scared of bugs.
- It's cute.

520
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,220
Kwang Soo,
Soo Young says you're cute.

521
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,740
Kwang Soo, Soo Young said
you were cute just now.

522
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,800
Being scared of bugs?

523
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,620
[Like this?]

524
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,480
Soo Young wants to see you dance!

525
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,820
- I haven't danced in a long time.
- She said it on the way here.

526
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,650
[Please dance, Kwang Soo!]

527
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,280
[A passionate dance]

528
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,650
[I can dance anytime, for you.]

529
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,740
[Oh my eyes! Once is enough...]

530
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,110
You guys have already
fallen in love with him.

531
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,020
The second game is
'Gigantic Tetris.'

532
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,940
- 'Tetris!'
- I'm good at it!

533
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,710
The color of your board is
the same color as your shirt.

534
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,250
The first team to fully
stack the blocks will win.

535
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,910
- That's hard.
- With these Tetriminoes.

536
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,050
They fly out from here.

537
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,370
[Six different types of Tetriminoes.]

538
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,570
Then you have to fill your board.

539
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,420
You can fight for the blocks.

540
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,570
However, you can't steal the ones
that have been inserted.

541
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,020
The team that wins round one
gets 1st place.

542
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,080
The team that wins round two
gets 2nd place.

543
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,450
Do you understand?
We'll start right away.

544
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,200
[They're ready.]
Hyo Yeon, let's do this!

545
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,080
[It seems like they
still have a grudge.]

546
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,850
We'll play rough, but don't get mad.

547
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,940
[More than anything, the point is to
get as many pieces as possible.]

548
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,080
[They're already marking down
their opponents before the game.]

549
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,250
- Be careful!
- Ready, set!

550
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,510
[Gigantic 'Tetris', round one starts!]

551
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,620
It's too big!

552
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,020
[Giraffe catches
the flying Tetrimino.]

553
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,600
[Catch Giraffe!]

554
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,850
[He's busy running away...]

555
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,570
[The second piece shoots!]

556
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,420
[No mark zone]

557
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,820
[What a welcome windfall!]

558
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,310
[Team Blue inserts the first piece.]

559
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,820
[Shooting two pieces in a row.]

560
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,940
[Wherever the piece lands
becomes the battlefield.]

561
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,500
[Big-nose gets two pieces.]

562
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,740
[Fighting for a piece
or aim for a new piece?]

563
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,420
Just catch another one.
[Team Green only gets one.]

564
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,510
- Get it!
- Watch out!

565
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,770
[Big-nose picks up
a Tetrimino quickly.]

566
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,370
[Big Nose's rush!]

567
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,970
[Team Blue is in the lead.]

568
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,050
[Kick]
[That's my Tetrimino!]

569
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,500
[Run, Ha Ha!]

570
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,370
[Trust me, Tiffany!]

571
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,310
[It's the wrong board.]

572
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,510
[Oh, it's wrong board!]

573
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,320
That's mine!
[Is this the right Tetrimino?]

574
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,220
[Drops]

575
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,520
[Yoona and Soo Young
keeps getting Tetriminoes.]

576
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,000
- Gary, she's here.
- I'm too short for this.

577
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,220
[The current state of the board]

578
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,080
[Ha Ha catches the Tetrimino.]

579
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,220
[Well, let me see...]

580
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,780
Grab that one!

581
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,600
[It's time to think
about the arrangement.]

582
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,800
- Ha Ha.
- Let's hurry up.

583
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,480
Hurry, hurry!

584
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,940
- We don't have space to put it.
- Kwang Soo!

585
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,510
[Run about in confusion]
Not there!

586
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,800
[Yoona and Soo Young has
a success rate of 100% in hunting.]

587
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,170
[Team Yellow starts to arrange
the Tetriminoes again.]

588
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,200
- We should put it like this.
- Yes, that's better.

589
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,650
Put this one on the top.

590
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,380
Why are you stealing from me?

591
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,820
[Team Orange starts hunting again.]
We have three segments left.

592
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,820
- What do we need?
- Three segments left.

593
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,000
- We need a dot and an I.
- We don't need the O.

594
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,660

We need an L.

597
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,770
I need a purple colored shape.

598
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,270
[With an I, Team Orange can win.]
Let's swap it.

599
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,880
That's right!
That's better.

600
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,940
[Team Yellow is
rearranging everything.]

601
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,800
[At that moment...]

602
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,620
[Kwang Soo steals their I.]
You can't steal it!

603
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,360
[Team Green also need
an O and a dot.]

604
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,680

because Giraffe took their Tetrimino.]

605

get another Tetrimino.]

606
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,670
Kwang Soo, take the I out.

607
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,240
Please give me the purple one!

609
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,510
We don't need it.

610
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,420
Kwang Soo, let's trade!

611
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,710
That doesn't fit.

612
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,490
[Ha Ha tries to steal.]

613
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,310

Take it out, Kwang Soo!

618

[They can complete the board
with the O and the dot.]

to Team Yellow.]

It's fun!

696
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,140
Lee Kwang Soo!

697
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,910
[Already four Tetriminoes!]

698
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
[Nice catch!]

699
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,680
Grab it!

700
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,620
[Yuri passes it to Ha Ha.]

701
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,050
[Nice teamwork!]
[They're winning...]

702
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,250
[When did Team Yellow
collect them all?]

703
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,280
[Yoona's nice catch!]

704
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,170
- Give me!
- Steal it!

705
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,370
[Team Yellow filled more than
half of the board.]

706
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,880
It's O again.

707
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,250
[Ha Ha keeps catching pieces.]

708
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,370
[We're almost done.]

709
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,200
[The rich get richer
and the poor get poorer.]

710
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,400
[It's the battle
between the two teams.]

711
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,540
Watch out, Tiffany!

712
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,820
[Ha Ha keeps grabbing them.]

713
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,650
Here's another one.
[They add two more.]

714
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,580
[They can finish it
if they have an I.]

715
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,820
They're almost done.

716
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,940
They need an I.

717
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,110
[It ain't over till it's over.]

718
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,020
- Blue piece!
- Then it'll be over.

719
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,370
[Soo Young and Yoona's
delivery service.]

720
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,940
- We need an I!
- Get a small one!

721
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,730
Wait, please start the music!

722
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,480
We need a dot.

723
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,040
[A dot or an I?]

724
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,710
Wait!

725
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,080
Please start the music!

726
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,220
[It's the 'Tetris' music!]

727
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,680
[They start dancing automatically.]

728
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,220
[Give me Tetriminoes!]

729
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,850
Give us a dot!

730
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,420
[A piece looks like this?]

731
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,850
Jae Suk, yes that one!

732
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,440
The small one!
Please!

733
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,540
[This is fun!]
The dot!

734
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,110
[Until when are you going to
make us dance?]

735
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,880
To the right!

736
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,680
To the left!

737
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,790
[Just give us the piece!]

738
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,800
Why aren't you giving us?

739
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,830
[Not that one, the dot!]

740
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,310
[The rare piece appears.]

741
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,970
[Drops]

742
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,850
It's the I!

743
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,140
[Come on, I!]

744
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,340
[One step late...]

745
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,450
Get up, Tiffany!

746
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,850
[Kkuk gives her back.]

747
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,020
[But that's their last piece!]

748
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:17,000
[Team Orange wins the second round.]

749
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,220
Jae Suk!
[Wait, is it over?]

750
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,000
- Jae Suk!
- It's over.

751
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,140
Who told you to dance with us?

753
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,220
I'm very sorry.

754
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,800
I was busy dancing.

755
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,680
I was enjoying it too much.

756
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,480
- Didn't I, Hyo Yeon?
- We had fun, didn't we?

757
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,480
How many times did I tell you
that we wanted the small piece!

758
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,910
[Here it is!]

759
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,540
Should we get down now?

760
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,570
[They have finally arrived at
the final stage of the game world.]

761
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,620
[In this mysterious maze...]

762
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,940
[who will survive to the end?]

763
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,770
It's the final mission of
'Welcome to the Game World.'

764
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:27,600
There are four bar codes
to let you escape the game world.

765
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,800
They're hidden inside this building.

766
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,650
There are four kinds of bar codes
which are A, B, C, and D.

767
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,480
On the ground floor, we'll see
a platform with a bar code scanner.

768
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,770
If you scan the four bar codes

769
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,740
in the order of A, B, C, and D

770
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,280
the password will be revealed
and it will open the gate.

771
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,600
Only one team can escape
the game world.

772
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,510
If you fail to escape, you have to
live in the game world forever.

773
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,080
- Oh no!
- What are you doing?

774
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,660
You're supposed to immersed
in this situation.

775
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,910
You can't even release your album
if you can't get out of here.

776
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,820
You need to search and find
the bar codes to escape.

777
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,600
But there are gatekeepers
who are aiming for your name tags.

778
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,370
[There are gatekeepers!]

779
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,710
- You can't oust them no matter what.
- We can't oust them?

780
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,170
No, you can't oust them.

781
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,310
Will we be ousted when they
eliminate our name tags?

782
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,910
Isn't that obvious?

783
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,220
- Is running the only way to avoid it?
- Yes.

784
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,020
[The unidentified gatekeepers...]

785
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,250
[who appear during the final stage.]

786
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,740
[What they're aiming for is...]

787
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,170
[only the name tag of 'Running Man.']

788
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:59,750
[Will you be able to avoid them...]

789
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,420
[and survive the final stage?]

790
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,650
There's another problem.

791
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,730
There's another entity
that blocks you from escaping

792
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,080
and it's called the 'Angel Code.'

793
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,700
[Angel Code]

794
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,470
Before the Angel Code
blocks you from escaping

795
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,050
you need to open the gate and escape.

796
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,250
Angel Code?

797
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,400
Here are the hints for the winners.

798
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,480
The first and second winners
of the first mission.

799
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,000
The first and second winners
of the second mission.

800
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,750
[Team Orange has two hints.]
Don't show it to others.

801
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,630
Keep it to yourselves
and start finding them.

802
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,970
This is a team battle.

803
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,940
[The final stage
of the game world starts!]

804
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,420
We should stick together.

805
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,880
- In the beginning.
- We shouldn't separate.

806
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,910
We need to find the bar code first.
[Ground floor, 'C' store]

807
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,180
[The third floor, 'V' hat store]
What's our hint?

808
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,280
[2nd floor, jewelry store]
[3rd floor, household items.]

809
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,740
Then we'll go to the second floor.

810
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:11,680
We'll split up here.
Go down where no one is around.

811
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,880
- Then we need to hurry up.
- Let's scatter and search!

812
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,480
Let's scatter.

813
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,870
Where do you think it is?

814
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,710
[Scream]
What is it?

815
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,940
[Shiver]

816
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,540
What's the sound?

817
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,580
I don't think it's here.

818
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,250
Someone just screamed.

819
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,950
What's the noise?

820
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,120
[Scream]

821
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,660
What's wrong?

822
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,090
- What is it?
- I'm scared.

823
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:56,160
[The cry gave everyone pause.]
What is it?

824
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,900
That's very scary.

825
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,010
[Surprised]

826
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,650
[Why does it happen
when I'm by myself.]

827
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,550
Why?
Who's screaming?

828
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,800
[Shocking]

829
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,250
[What are they?]

830
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,930
[The 3rd floor gatekeepers]
[20 masked men]

831
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,620
[The group masked men
attack Blank Ji!]

832
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,820
Suk Jin!

833
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,770
What's going on?
They're coming here!

834
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,080
[Go away as far as possible!]
Wait!

835
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,000
[A creepy chase on the third floor]

836
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,250
[She got caught!]

837
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,400
Suk Jin!

838
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,420
[No one's going to help you...]

839
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,600
You're too scary!
Why are you doing this to me?

840
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,680
Why me?

841
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,880
Oh no!

842
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,170
<i>Song Ji Hyo is out,
Song Ji Hyo is out.</i>

843
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,910
[What's going on?]

844
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,140
[Creepy]
Is Ji Hyo ousted?

845

[The 'V' hat store in third floor]

846
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,690
- Unbelievable!
- Ji Hyo is out.

847
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,290
It should be inside a hat.

848
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,020
- In a hat.
- Be careful.

849
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,050
- Should I go out and watch?
- Yes, watch for them.

850
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,110
Run, if I say so.

851
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,540
[Haroro joins Team Green.]

852
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,510
It's so strange.

853
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,570
- Why?
- Ji Hyo got out so fast.

854
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,540
- They might oust us, too.
- It's so scary all of a sudden.

855
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,740
Hyo Yeon, you're not hiding
anything from us, right?

856
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,680
What is it?

857
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,400
[They're back!]
Hyo Yeon!

858

[The men run away
leaving Hyo Yeon behind.]

859

Hyo Yeon, we're sorry!

860

[They couldn't care about her.]

861
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,170
[How could they...]

862
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,250
[They didn't see Hyo Yeon.]
Hurry up and hide!

[Throb]

864
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,440

looking for the bar code.]

Huh?

871
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,140
Here it is!

872
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,540
[She finds the bar code B.]

873
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,740
This is it.
Quickly, before anyone comes.

874
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,000
Barcode B...

875
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,510
Ha Ha!
[She is even more scared outside.]

876
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,310
What should I do?

877
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,650
I'm so scared!

878
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,620
[She runs to the corner.]

879
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,730
[Scream]

880
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,000
[Ti...Tiffany?]

881
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,480
Oh my god, I was scared to death!

882
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:31,420
I was hiding in here.
Where did you go?

883
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,040
Is Ji Hyo out?

884
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,200
I can't believe it.

885
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,820
This is tough!

886
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,110
It's very tough today.

887
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,510
[Wriggle]

888
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,130
Don't go out this way.
[It feels weird...]

889
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,620
[Someone is walking around.]

890
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,540
[Grab]

891
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,200
What are you?
Wait!

892
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,750
Are you trying to
eliminate my name tag?

893
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,250
Wait a minute!

894
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,940
[He eliminates Suk Jin's
name tag in a flash.]

895
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,170
[What is it?]
Am I out?

896
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,940
What just happened?

897
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,510
[He bows and disappears.]

898
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,600
Am I really out?

899
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,040
<i>Ji Suk Jin is out!</i>

900
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,020
I think gatekeepers are strong.

901
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,740
- How do they look like?
- They're wearing masks.

902
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,480
- Really?
- It's so scary.

903
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,450
They're really scary.

904
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,170
[The bookstore is in panic.]

905
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,370
- Do you want to go up?
- But if we go, the gate...

906
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,140
[Shocking!]

907
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,030
[What did she see?]

908
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,280
[He's back!]

909
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,480
[The killer in crimson suit!]

910
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,740
What do we do?

911
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,880
What is going to happen
to Soo Young?

912
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,710
[She attacks his vital spot!]

913
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,340
[Kick!]

914
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,650
Choi Min Ho!

915
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,200
[The gatekeeper on the second floor]

916
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,540
[Shinee's Min Ho]
[The fastest gatekeeper]

917
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,880
[The most athletic idol]

918
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,050
[He's here to hunt us!]

919
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,200
Choi Min Ho, go away!

920
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,170
It's me, Min Ho!
No!

921
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:11,170
[Haroro witnessed this.]
Who's that?

922
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,280
[It's like an African safari tour!]
Who is it?

923
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,310
Here's another gatekeeper!

924
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,620
<i>- Jae Suk!
- Kwang Soo...</i>

925
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,310
There's a guy here who's
wearing a crimson suit.

926
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,610
[No one is willing to help her.]

927
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,790
Min Ho, no!
[Soo Young's life hangs by a hair.]

928
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,250
Min Ho, I'm on 'Running Man'
for the first time.

929
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,940
Please give me one more chance!

930
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,970
Your surname is also Choi like me.

931
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,250
Min Ho, you know
how much I care about you!

932
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,250
We even took the same class.

933
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:54,370
- The drama class we took...
- Okay, calm down.

934
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,910
- I see.
- Don't tell anyone that I'm here.

935
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,680
I'm sorry and I love you, Min Ho!

936
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,220
I'll come back later.

937
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,970
Unbelievable!
It was Shinee!

938
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,340
I was scared to death!

939
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:15,400
[The king of persuasion,
Soo Young survives.]

940
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,340
[Is he gone?]

941
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,850
Who's the man wearing the mask?

942
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,740
[This is just a warm-up!]

943
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,250
[The instinct for hunting name tags!]
It's all because of Soo Young.

944
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,450
[The atmosphere is really weird.]

945
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,340
[Get ready, if you're
on the second floor!]

946
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,540
No, don't do that!

947
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,050
Eh?
How can you do this to me?

948
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,770
Come over here!

949
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,510
Min Ho, come here!

950
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,170
Choi Min Ho is here!

951
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:10,680
[Tiffany went out
at the wrong moment.]

952
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,040
[She is targeted by Min Ho
right away.]

953
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,420
[Min Ho ousted three people.]
I met you yesterday!

954
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,110
Why does it matter?

955
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,420
<i>Tiffany is out!</i>

956
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,000
[He's enjoying a glass of water
after the hunting.]

957
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,970
[He's giving it to the VJ.]
You've worked so hard.

958
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,680
Let's just do this a little longer.

959
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,540
[He's aiming for his next target.]

960
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,800
[It's Seo Hyun.]

961
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,800
Min Ho!

962
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,580
[I've caught another one...]

963
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,600
[He runs to attack another one.]

964
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,140
[No mercy!]

965
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,820
Min Ho!

966
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,820
Whose team are you on?

967
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,310
[Why, all of a sudden...]
Kim Jong Kook!

968
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,310
It's Kim Jong Kook, right?

969
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:17,010
<i>Tae Yeon is out!</i>

970
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,210
[Well... who else is there?]

971
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,050
What if Min Ho catches me again?

972
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,980
[I think Min Ho might come back
if I stay on the second floor.]

973
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,140
[She hurries to go down.]

974
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,450
[Oh my god!]

975
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,200
[There's someone on the ground floor?]

976
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,140
[And that's even scarier.]

977
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,970
[Terrified!]

978
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,540
[The huge presence
on the ground floor]

979
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:57,310
[Ground floor gatekeeper,
Choi Hong Man]

980
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,910
[The strongest guy in Korea]

981
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,280
[He becomes the final boss
of the game world]

982
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,970
[and appears in front of 'Running Man.']

983
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,940
[They tried to avoid Min Ho...]

984
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,340
[but they might get
caught by Hong Man.]

985
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,800
[They start running instinctively.]

986
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,340
[You'll die if you get caught!]

987
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,450
[Min Ho approaches from upstairs]

988
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,570
[and Hong Man attacks from downstairs!]

989
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:39,880
[Frantic struggle]

990
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,510
[They are sandwiched
in between the two!]

991
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,740
[Grabs!]

992
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,510
[Hong Man captures Giraffe!]

993
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,450
[Min Ho eliminates it.]

994
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:01,110
[Hong Man keeps smashing Giraffe.]

995
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,410
[He's about to rip his shirt.]
I ripped it.

996
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,880
[Giraffe's skin is exposed by force.]
It's my mistake!

997
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,920
[I'm still hungry...]

998
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,510
[This is the strongest back smashing
I've ever had.]

999
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,020
[Lee Kwang Soo is out.]

1000
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,450
[Next...]

1001
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,020
[who should I please?]

1002
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,000
[They're analyzing the situation.]

1003
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,250
I think Hong Man
stays on the ground floor.

1004
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,880
That man stays on the second floor.
He looks like Choi Min Ho.

1005
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
- Who's that?
- Min Ho from Shinee.

1006
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,450
- Really?
- I think he's Min Ho.

1007
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,080
- I was shocked.
- Scary!

1008
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,170
What's that?

1009
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,080
[They saw the masked men now.]
Can they oust us?

1010
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:08,200
They can?
All of them?

1011
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,540
Hurry and find it before anyone sees us.

1012
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,200
Check that side
and I'll check the other side.

1013
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,250
Where is it?

1014
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,310
How can we find it here?

1015
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,570
Look! I found it!

1016
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,220
- I found it!
- Where? Amazing!

1017
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,280
Let's check all the stores.

1018
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,970
Let's get out of here.

1019
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,900
I can't go downstairs.

1020
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,400
- Maybe it's in the kitchen.
- Should we look here?

1021
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,400
I'm not good at searching.

1022
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,910
I'm not good at finding stuff.

1023
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,110
Me, neither.

1024
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,520
[They find a mysterious cube.]

1025
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:05,970
Do you know how to solve it?

1026
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,940
[Let me see...]

1027
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,250
I think this is...

1028
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,650
the angel code.

1029
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,310
Yes, this is angel code.

1030
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,620
- Is that really?
- Yes, it is.

1031
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,910
- You didn't solve it.
- Look.

1032
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,080
I solved one face.

1033
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,540
- Sad.
- I think there's a letter.

1034
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:34,400
It's so pretty.

1035
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,680
It's cold.

1036
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:45,600
[She accidentally finds a cube.]

1037
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,910
What is this?
Should I solve it?

1038
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,850
I'm bad at this!

1039
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,540
[What is this for?]

1040
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,250
I suck at it.

1041
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,570
What am I supposed to do?

1042
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:04,140
How do I solve it?

1043
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,510
I found a weird thing.

1044
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,620
<i>Isn't that the angel code?</i>

1045
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,890
- What did you say?
- Angel Code.

1046
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,370
[What is angel code...]

1047
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,420
They mentioned angel code before.

1048
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,650
I think that's it.

1049
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,400
Let's meet.
I'll be there.

1050
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,970
[Is the angel code
really related to this cube?]

1051
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,110
<i>Choi Hong Man is unlocked.</i>

1052
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,250
<i>Min Ho is unlocked.</i>

1053
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,110
[The gatekeepers are unlocked
after they found the angel codes.]

1054
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:43,020
[Which means...]

1055
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,620
Min Ho is unlocked, too?

1056
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,600
[the gatekeepers can
go anywhere they want.]

1057
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,740
Now, it's time!

1058
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:57,400
Let's drink some water and go.

1059
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:03,250
[There's no safe zone!]

1060
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,970
We need to solve it quickly.

1061
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,970
[They're looking for bar codes again.]

1062
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:14,370
[And he sees the gatekeepers!]

1063
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,400
What is Jae Suk going to do?

1064
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,260
[He's chased by the masked men.]

1065
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,000
[He goes to the second floor.]

1066
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,310
It was close.

1067
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,280
[At that moment!]

1068
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,170
[One shot, one kill!]

1069
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:39,010
I got caught by Min Ho!

1070
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:42,450
- Min Ho!
- I'm sorry.

1071
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:45,350
- You've worked so hard today.
- I'm sorry.

1072
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,420
You've been running by yourself.
When did you get here?

1073
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,950
I saw the color of Grasshopper...

1074
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,660
- Min Ho...
- I'm sorry.

1075
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,000
It's okay.

1076
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,990
<i>Yoo Jae Suk is out.</i>

1077
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:00,130
[Hyo Yeon is the only survivor
of Team Green.]

1078
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,140
We need to find it quickly.

1079
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,970
There's no other way.

1080
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,850
We need to search
every nook and cranny.

1081
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,050
[Team Orange has
the bar code A and B.]

1082
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,050
What do we do?

1083
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:20,880
It's right there!
I found the bar code D!

1084
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:25,600
I found A, B and D.
I only need the bar code C.

1085
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,800
[They can escape
if they find one more!]

1086
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,880
Yuri, we only need the bar code C.

1087
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,620
[Meanwhile, Yuri is...]

1088
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,910
[solving the cube
in a hidden spot.]

1089
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,280
Ah? Ya?

1090
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,880
[Team Yellow tries to solve it, too.]
It worked!

1091
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,710
Look, I solved one face.

1092
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,650
That's an 'A.'

1093
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,450
But why?

1094
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:55,480
- With an 'A'...
- Angel?

1095
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,740
[She gets nervous all of a sudden.]

1096
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,710
- Let me get inside the fitting room.
- Soo Young.

1097
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:07,020
I solved another face.

1098
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,710
Another A?

1099
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:17,970
[What does this mean?]

1100
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:23,210
[At that moment...
someone is breathing hard?]

1101
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,850
[Ta-da!]

1102
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:29,850
[Peek]

1103
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,370
<i>It's Hong Man.
What do we do?</i>

1104
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:39,800
[Why are they quiet all of a sudden?]

1105
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,680
[He's too nervous, he starts laughing.]

1106
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,650
[We need to get out of here.]

1107
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,850
It seems like there's something here.

1108
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,480
[Yoona escapes.]

1109
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,880
[What a chance!]

1110
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,350
[While Hong Man looks at Yoona,
Gary escapes, too.]

1111
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:13,460
[Run for your life!]

1112
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,530
I thought I was going to die.

1113
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:23,270
I thought you already left.
I was trying to lure him.

1114
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,140
Min Ho came here, too.
Come on.

1115
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:31,040
Yoona!

1116
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,650
[Min Ho passes Yoona.]
He's really fast!

1117
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,710
[This is the speed
you can see on TV.]

1118
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:44,650
[Gary is doing his best to run away.]
Yoona!

1119
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,330
[He gets caught soon.]

1120
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,880
Gary is over.

1121
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,800
It's interesting to watch it live.

1122
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,470
Did he eliminate his name tag?
Is he out?

1123
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,680
<i>Gary is out.</i>

1124
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,100
<i>- Gary is out.
- What do we do?</i>

1125
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,740
[Was it a good idea to be in here?]

1126
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,740
[Huh?]

1127
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,580
I think there's something inside.

1128
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,520
[Hong Man's attack.]

1129
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,260
There should be something.

1130
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,720
[Extreme fear]
There's got to be something.

1131
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:46,600
[On top of that, Min Ho joins him.]

1132
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,140
- It's me.
- Who is it?

1133
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,210
Is it Soo Young?
It's Soo Young.

1134
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,880
- Please, let me live.
- Should I break the door?

1135
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,610
I'm going to break it!

1136
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,650
- Hong Man, I...
- What?

1137
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,680
This is the first time
I'm on 'Running Man.'

1138
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,120
This is my first time, too.

1139
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,800
It's my first time.
Can't you let me live once?

1140
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,400
Then, I'll give you all
the SNSD members' phone number.

1141
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,830
Really?

1142
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,320
[He's hesitating.]
I shouldn't do that...

1143
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,970
Then, I...
will buy you a meal anytime.

1144
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:28,490
Really?

1145
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:31,000
This is such a nice offering.
But I shouldn't listen.

1146
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,490
Are you willing to give up
on the phone numbers

1147
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,090
concert tickets and
a CD with autographs?

1148
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,060
I see.
I'll leave for now.

1149
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,190
I know you're just pretending to leave.

1150
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,890
[Hong Man leaves with a huge benefit.]

1151
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:53,860
[Is he really gone?]

1152
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:04,340
[Soo Young is the
queen of negotiation.]

1153
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,140
Not many people have gone
to the ground floor.

1154
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,610
I'm sure there's
something there.

1155
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:14,850
[I want to at least find a bar code.]

1156
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:26,290
[Min Ho is walking
around the ground floor.]

1157
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,700
[Did he see me?]

1158
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,610
[At a time like this...]

1159
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:43,340
[Run!]

1160
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:51,590
[Speed vs. speed]

1161
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,460
[Min Ho's full speed!]

1162
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,800
[Kkuk lost?]

1163
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,730
[He seizes Kkuk
and calls out Hong Man.]

1164
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,840
Hong Man!

1165
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:15,800
[I'm on my way!]

1166
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:21,480
[He needs to hold Kkuk
until Hong Man gets here.]

1167
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,520
It's slippery!

1168
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,020
[If Jong Kook is a tiger...]

1169
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,400
[Hong Man is... a dinosaur.]

1170
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,090
[How will the battle between
a dinosaur and a tiger be?]

1171
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,470
[One-way discipline mode.]

1172
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,570
[Kkuk looks small and weak
for the first time.]

1173
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:53,890
[Even after he eliminates his
name tag, he keeps disciplining.]

1174
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:57,090
Thank you, Hong Man.

1175
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,290
[Kim Jong Kook is out.]

1176
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,200
I thought I can't oust you by myself.

1177
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,320
[Total wreck]

1178
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,970
This was the climax of the day.
We caught him.

1179
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,630
Jong Kook is really fast.

1180
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:22,660
He's weaker than I thought.

1181
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:25,970
[He's the only man
who can actually mean it.]

1182
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,460
[After gathering all the bar codes...]

1183
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,750
[they need to get to the platform.]

1184
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,970
Where are you?

1185
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,830
[Ha Ha searches for bar codes]
[Yuri solves the cube.]

1186
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,840
I found the bar code C!

1187
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,400
Where is she?

1188
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:01,200
[Finally, Team Orange
found all the bar codes.]

1189
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:06,120
Min Ho is right there,
what can I do?

1190
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:11,490
[He needs to run to the platform!]

1191
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,370
You need to hide.

1192
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,320
I saw Y and A.

1193
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,460
Also an O...

1194
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,060
[Min Ho starts his engine again.]

1195
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,370
Yellow face has an 'O.'

1196
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:34,320
and the red face also has an 'O'
The green has 'Y.'

1197
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,430
[Someone is around here?]

1198
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,090
[It's going to be one on one
with Min Ho!]

1199
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,770
Yoo Ee?

1200
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,630
Or Yoo...

1201
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,060
[Yoona... hi?]

1202
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,120
Could it be...

1203
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,750
Yoona?

1204
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,490
[The gatekeeper passes her?]

1205
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:24,060
[We need to stop Yoona now!]
I need to find Yoona.

1206
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,320
[He's definitely not catching her!]

1207
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,460
Yoona, it's me!

1208
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,800
[Earlier...]

1209
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,890
[Min Ho did not catch Yoona either.]

1210
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,770
[Gatekeepers don't attack
the angel code.]

1211
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:57,220
[Because the angel code
is the game master.]

1212
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:10,270
[Y O O]

1213
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:14,350
[N A]

1214
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:18,060
[YOONA]

1215
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,600
Why was I even running then?

1216
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,550
<i>You are the angel
of the game world.</i>

1217
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,830
<i>The moment you connect
to the computer on the platform</i>

1218
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:36,920
<i>a virus will spread on the computer,
and no one can escape.</i>

1219
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,800
<i>Please go to the platform immediately</i>

1220
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,860
<i>and scan the bar code on your wrist.</i>

1221
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:48,120
[Yoona needs to go to the platform.]

1222
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,150
Did you solve it?

1223
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:53,750
[Yuri is in front of her!]

1224
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:59,290
<i>Yoo Ee, or Yoo...</i>

1225
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:04,030
<i>Yoona?
[Yuri knows Yoona is the angel code.]</i>

1226
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,920
Did you solve the cube?

1227
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:13,030
[Did she figure out
that I'm the angel code?]

1228
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,430
Where are you, Ha Ha?

1229
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:21,090
[Ha Ha is looking for a chance
to get to the platform.]

1230
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,750
[Ha Ha needs to leave Min Ho out.]

1231
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:30,550
[Yoona will succeed if she keeps
her name tag and gets to the platform.]

1232
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,260
[Where is Ha Ha anyway?]

1233
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,750
Ha Ha!

1234
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:41,490
[Min Ho sees Ha Ha first!]

1235
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:45,400
[I have to gamble now!]

1236
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,100
[Ha Ha throws down the four bar codes.]
Run, Yuri!

1237
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,900
[But Hong Man is waiting
on the ground floor.]

1238
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,400
- Run!
- Why did you do that?

1239
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,290
Hong Man, you need to catch her!

1240
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,940
No, run!

1241
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,520
Hong Man, catch her!

1242
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,230
[Yuri runs to get the bar codes!]

1243
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:13,060
[I need to get to the platform
before Yuri gets there!]

1244
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,120
[Hesitate]

1245
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,260
[How can I avoid Hong Man
and pick them up?]

1246
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:26,530
Yoona, let's help each other.

1247
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,720
Look at Hong Man!

1248
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,750
[Is she aiming for Yoona's name tag?]

1249
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,810
No!
[Yoona starts running.]

1250
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:40,000
[Yuri, it's up to you!]

1251
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:44,770
[Please stop Yoona, Hong Man!]

1252
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,850
[But the angel code Yoona
is not afraid of Hong Man!]

1253
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:51,950
[Yoona gets to the platform.]
Why doesn't he attack her?

1254
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,350
Why not, Hong Man?

1255
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:57,570
[Yuri knows that Yoona is the angel code
but does not know he doesn't attack her.]

1256
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,160
Why do you let her go?

1257
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,830
[The computer is recognizing
Yoona's fingerprint.]

1258
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:09,940
[Yoona only needs to scan
the bar code on her wrist.]

1259
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,750
[Yuri, what's going on?]

1260
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:21,650
[Finally! Yoona scans the bar code.]

1261
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:25,590
[Yoona successfully spreads the virus.]

1262
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,360
<i>Game over!</i>

1263
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:33,800
[Disappointed]

1264
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,950
We lost.

1265
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,870
[The angel code, Yoona's victory!]

1266
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,270
[Min Ho was the strongest hunter.]

1267
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:47,870
- Min Ho ousted everyone.
- Hong Man is upset.

1268
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,380
No, I'm happy to have this.

1269
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,980
It's only name tag elimination
but he was going to rip my shirt.

1270
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,320
He hurt you?

1271
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,180
You've work so hard!

1272
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:05,700
Yoona wins in solo
and the rest of you'll stay here.

1273
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,760
Don't you need to call their agency
since they can't go out?

1274
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,500
I don't really mind staying here.

1275
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,950
Please turn on the air conditioner,
then it'll be perfect.

1276
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:21,900
Thank you for being on the show,
SNSD, Min Ho, and Hong Man.
