1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,570
[It's officially summer!]

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,740
[A healthy summer with health foods!]

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,370
[A heated fight to win the health foods!]

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,610
[Refreshing the body!
Refreshing the mind!]

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,780
[Extreme pool missions!]

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,330
[Go away, heat wave!]

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,440
We always come to
Gyeongju in the summer.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,750
There are six pairs of chairs.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,190
- Is it a blind date?
- Thank you!

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,240
- Getting me all excited!
- It says 'Peek-a-boo, Jae Suk!'

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,060
- 'Brother Jong Kook?'
- What is this?

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,070
- Wait.
- 'Bro Suk Jin.'

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,270
- Look at the writing!
- 'Bro Suk Jin?'

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,870
- 'Come visit me.'
- 'Bro Suk Jin!'

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,330
Who is this?
'You were in my dream, Gary'?

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,390
- Gary, today...
- What's this?

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,560
Don't come near me today,
don't come near my partner!

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,500
The writing tells so much!

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,610
- It's really vivid.
- I like this.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,810
- Wait!
- Gary's partner might be Ji Hyo!

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,700
I really wish Gary
gets paired with Ji Hyo today.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,810
Are you there?

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,210
- Who wrote 'Peek-a-boo'?
- Everyone sat down already.

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,470
- You have blinds in front of you.
- Yes!

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,610
Please lift the blinds slowly,
starting with Jae Suk.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,130
I'm nervous!

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,910
[She covered her face with flowers.]
They're not boy group idols, are they?

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,650
[Her fingers...]
Wait a minute!

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,410
Her hands are delicate!

30
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,530
Her hands look young!

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,130
[One finger movement
captures their attention.]

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,300
[He carefully lifts up the blinds.]

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,900
Why are you going up?
[Her body is going up with the blinds.]

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,330
[Who's Yoo Hyuk's partner?]
Who is it?

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,800
Her hair's red!

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
[Soyu from SISTAR]

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,700
[SISTAR's fresh character, Soyu.]

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,140
Soyu!
[Cute]

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,210
[Everyone wants Soyu's attention.]

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,550
[Soyu's cool charm is coming soon!]
I like Soyu!

41
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,590
[Next up, single man Kkuk.]

42
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,210
[He dreams of love again today...]
So it's this kind of excitement.

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,330
Today's is like a girl idol concept...

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,990
Jong Kook should look for a bride now.

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,560
- Don't say that.
- You better prepare yourself.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,190
[Brother Jong Kook]

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,300
You have to find a bride!

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,470
[Her nasally voice!]
Jong Kook!

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,700
[He suddenly gets up.]

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,390
- Her voice is so pretty!
- Who is it?

51
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,870
- Jong Kook, it's me!
- Who is it?

52
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,130
Wait a minute.

53
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,190
Is it Bomi? Is that you?

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,280
[Bomi from A-Pink.]

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,730
[She has a fairy-like appearance
but an easy-going personality!]

56
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,760
She has such a husky voice
for an idol.

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,130
- Hello!
- Bomi is here!

58
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,210
Bomi came here last time!

59
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,130
Wow!

60
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,560
- Gary's partner is...
- What?

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,390
[Everyone's distracted
by Gary's partner.]

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,470
Jae Suk!
Why are you so excited?

63
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,210
- Is my partner pretty?
- Yes, she is!

64
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,210
- Lift it!
- She's incredible!

65
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,100
I hope Gary doesn't collapse!

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,900
[I was the one who
dreamed about Gary!]

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,010
You wanted to meet her so much!

68
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,610
[The woman Gary wanted to meet...]

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,930
- I'm getting my hopes up!
- You should!

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,790
[He lifts the blinds up calmly.]

71
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,390
I dreamed about you!

72
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,210
[She said she dreamed about him!]

73
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,730
[This is the power of
'I dreamed about you!']

74
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,810
Who dreamed about me?

75
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,250
[Rising star, Seol Hyun from AOA]

76
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,440
[From music charts and ads to dramas!
She's the hottest icon!]

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,590
[Heart attack!]

78
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,410
[Shy]
I have a crush on her!

79
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,560
He kept talking about
her in Hong Kong.

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,670
He said Seol Hyun was
the most beautiful girl.

81
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,270
- Gary said that to me, too.
- Thank you.

82
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,300
I've got a heart attack.

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,340
Gary is wearing really
expensive pants today!

84
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,400
Original Penguin pants!

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,870
Kwang Soo dressed up the most today!

86
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,610
[He looks likes a man
from the drama 'The Rustic Era.']

87
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,130
Have high expectations!
Your partner is awesome!

88
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,880
I can see Kwang Soo's partner.

89
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,620
[Wait, Giraffe!]
You see her?

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,020
- Next is Suk Jin!
- Why isn't anyone excited over there?

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,230
She's covering her face,
but her clothes look youthful.

92
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,230
[A heated response.]
This is it!

93
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,960
- Lift it up fast.
- She's young.

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,670
- She's younger than you think!
- Thank you!

95
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,840
- She's cute.
- Oh, black!

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,390
- Is it Ji Hyo?
- Suk Jin!

97
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,220
- Suk Jin!
- Oh, wow!

98
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,590
[Why is he so surprised today?]

99
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,010
[Big Nose's partner is Blank Ji.]
Lift it up already!

100
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,530
- Oh, wow.
- What's wrong with you?

101
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,730
[Suk Jin's partner is Ji Hyo.]
Ji Hyo is pretty!

102
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,930
Me?
Who is it?

103
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,960
[Ha Ha's partner is blonde?]

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,410
- She's blonde!
- Her fingers scared me!

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,340
That scared me!

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,110
You're very provocative!

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,510
She's tanned!

108
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,080
She's blonde!
Who is it?

109
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,100
[Bora from Sistar!]

110
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,360
[She came with me.]
Bora!

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,170
You came, Bora!
[Ha Ha's satisfied with his partner.]

112
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,900
Kwang Soo!
[It's finally Giraffe's turn!]

113
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,790
[Who could it be?]

114
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,640
[Rustle, rustle]
They might go out in real life!

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,100
[Full of expectation.]
Let me roll it up!

116
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,960
[The woman who captured
my full attention...]

117
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,390
[The Ultimate Weapon, Lee Gook Joo.]
Gook Joo?

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
[Gook Joo and Giraffe
are the same age.]

119
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,690
Shake it, shake it!

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,590
Wow, Lee Gook Joo!

121
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,990
Like me!
More, more!

122
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,240
Whoo! Yes!

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,900
[That's it!]
He dressed up well today.

124
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
[He couldn't hold in his happiness.]

125
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,240
[An uppercut ceremony for the PD!]

126
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,390
[I want to share the happiness!]

127
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,520
[Nice to meet you, partner!]

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,990
[Extreme visual couple is born.]

129
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,020
I think Kwang Soo sincerely likes me.

130
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,390
That's a relief!

131
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,630
I think today's filming
will be a blast!

132
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,900
There's so much energy!

133
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,560
The staff is giving us a prize.

134
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,250
[After their happy blind date...]

135
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,900
'Running Man' is a great job!

136
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,730
- They give us a prize sometimes.
- It's the best workplace!

137
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,040
Gook Joo is wearing
her best clothes today.

138
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,160
[Shake, shake]

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,640
Gook Joo couldn't contact her stylist!

140
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,700
I left my house at 4 a.m.
to come to Gyeongju.

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,870
My stylist doesn't answer the phone.
I heard we were gong to play in the pool.

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,670
I'm just going in with my underwear!

143
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,010
- I don't have anything!
- What are you saying?

144
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,900
Should I cry and go back home?
I'm a pro!

145
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,040
Of course, I have to try hard!

146
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,790
She's a professional.

147
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,810
I thought you must be tired
because it's the start of early summer.

148
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,560
We've prepared some health foods
that will improve your stamina

149
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,930
for all of you that have
worked hard until now.

150
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,330
[Getting ready to eat.]

151
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,210
The couples will change
and meet up at a restaurant.

152
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,390
There are cars waiting to take you
to Korea's top three healthy foods.

153
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,930
You can choose whichever menu
you want and get in the car.

154
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,270
One car can take up to four people.

155
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,610
So only two teams can
go to the same place.

156
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,810
Your fate depends on

157
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,160
which couple you go with.

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,560
It might change
the whole game of the day.

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,470
You have to pick carefully.
[A worried face]

160
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,810
There aren't any mid-way
couple switches, right?

161
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,760
- Why?
- Are there?

162
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,610
- Are there?
- I'm just asking.

163
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,990
We're not going to
switch couples, right?

164
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,040
Well, we don't have
high expectations with these men!

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,010
[Gook Joo speaks like a professional.]

166
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,790
To be honest, the best one out of
the bunch already got married.

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,810
[Drop the detailed explanation!]

168
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,240
Is the six-pack all you've got?

169
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,330
- His toes are rotting!
- What do you mean?

170
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,130
[Extremely embarrassed]
He only cares about his abs!

171
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,730
Take care of your feet!

172
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,070
[I didn't know you could crack a joke
out of someone's toes...]

173
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,380
Take care of them!

174
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,410
[Let's take a look...]

175
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,730
Kwang Soo, don't wear sandals!

176
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,570
- His toes are curled up.
- I haven't wore them in five years!

177
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,440
[Will this couple be okay?]

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,160
[Escape the heat with summer delicacies
that boost your energy!]

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,410
[Enjoy the dance party!]

180
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,930
[And win the water games!]

181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,100
Kwang Soo changed into sneakers
because of your joke.

182
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,010
Let's hurry!

183
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,200
What do you want to eat?
Hurry!

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,990
I want the chicken soup with ginseng!

185
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,160
[A race to eat the greatest dish.]
What should we eat?

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,590
- Premium beef!
- Premium beef!

187
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,590
[Team Yellow and Team Green
head to the premium beef.]

188
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,210
[Teams Yellow and Green
acquire the premium beef.]

189
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,610
[They don't even look
at the other offerings.]

190
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,930
[Hooray for premium beef!]

191
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,190
Premium beef!
Premium beef!

192
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,670
[Team Red and Team Blue
ran to get the eel.]

193
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,100
[Who they go with is
an important matter.]

194
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,640
- I love eel, but it's Jong Kook...
- It has to be eel!

195
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Eel is the best.

196
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,210
I want to eat
chicken soup with ginseng!

197
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,470
Is the car for the chicken soup full?

198
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,470
[He tries to negotiate]
You don't want to switch with eel?

199
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,390
- You don't want the eel?
- Who's over there?

200
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,520
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Oh, is that right?

201
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,670
We'll just have
chicken soup with ginseng.

202
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,210
[I have no choice
but to have eel with Kkuk...]

203
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,990
[Chicken soup with ginseng,
premium beef, and grilled eel.]

204
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,210
It's going to be delicious!
It's good for your health.

205
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,530
Yeah, I wanted chicken soup with ginseng.

206
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,840
I hope it isn't like where
only one team gets to eat.

207
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,330
[Sudden anxiety]
It makes me nervous.

208
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,190
If our team doesn't get to eat,
please feed Seol Hyun.

209
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,530
[Will only one team get to eat?]
Don't worry!

210
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,760
[Team Red and Team Blue
are headed to eat eel.]

211
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,330
- I've been to Gyeongju a few times.
- It's really nice here.

212
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,300
We came here for our school trips.

213
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,300
I came here for the Dream Concerts,
but it's my first time driving around.

214
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,790
- It's beautiful.
- It's really nice.

215
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,530
How long were you a trainee, Soyu?

216
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,210
- Since my first year in high school.
- Oh, you were pretty young.

217
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,190
I went on a retreat
and I've got picked up.

218
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,960
I used to be an idol...

219
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,300
- Didn't you debut in high school?
- I debuted after I graduated.

220
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,470
No, I meant for fighting.

221
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,960
Don't you have rock fists?

222
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,670
[They're heading to
the perfect mission for him.]

223
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,930
[Team Green and Yellow are...]
You guys might be the winners.

224
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,330
- Let's go, Gook Joo!
- You'll be focused only on winning.

225
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,090
When we were in the waiting room

226
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,410
she told me she wanted
to be Kwang Soo's partner.

227
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,900
Gook Joo's like my family.
I was really happy.

228
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,070
I never had a family member like you!
What are you saying?

229
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,240
- What are you saying?
- We're not family.

230
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,330
- Our genes are completely different.
- Well, yeah...

231
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,790
He revealed his six-pack to the public.

232
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,610
So I was really curious.

233
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,130
- Don't touch mine.
- He exercises.

234
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,270
He put pressure on
his stomach when I asked.

235
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,560
I didn't!
[Don't make me shy.]

236
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,280
Spend 10% of the time you worry about
your six-pack and focus on your toes.

237
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,590
- My toes aren't rotting!
- Because you need to wear sandals.

238
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,610
I brought many pairs of
sandals to wear today!

239
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,330
[Water park]

240
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,500
[Premium beef restaurant]

241
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,730
Premium beef, premium beef!

242
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,440
[Team Yellow and Team Green
enter the beef restaurant.]

243
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,940
You don't give food without
giving something in return.

244
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,210
If you give us premium beef,
I will do whatever you ask!

245
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,870
It's here, it's here!
They even have charcoal ready!

246
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,870
[Chant his name...]

247
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,130
[The beef god always protects
our dinner table...]

248
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,060
- Look at the marveling!
- It's victory onions!

249
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,700
You make wraps with it.

250
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You can only get victory onions
at luxurious restaurants.

251
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,360
You can't eat it!
Put it down!

252
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,900
- Wow!
- Oh my god!

253
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,390
[The healthiest
chicken soup with ginseng.]

254
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,470
It's Korean native chicken!

255
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,360
[Full of stamina!]
We can't get this in Seoul.

256
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,840
The unit price is 55,000 won.

257
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,790
[His deep emotion with an appraisal!]

258
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,990
[Team Red and Team Blue
came to the eel restaurant.]

259

[Truly moved]
It looks really good!

[The guardian of health, eel.]
It's sizzling!

261
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,810
It's 'The Queen of Early Summer Race.'

262
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,870
Only one queen who
wins the final mission

263
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,010
can become the Queen of Early Summer.

264
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,500
- I need to make her the queen?
- That's right.

265
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,160
The females will put on
an armband on their left arm.

266
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,070
Don't wrap it too tight,
I'll have poor blood circulation.

267
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,270
[Aren't there any XL armbands?]

268
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,730
[The six Queens have
put on their armbands.]

269
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,010
- Starting now...
- Do I rip it off?

270
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,070
No.
[Goose bumps]

271
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,240
Each team member must obey
everything the queen says.

272
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
- You cannot disobey your queen.
- Really?

273
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,670
Can I tell him what to do?

274
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,240
The important thing is,
the queen that wins each mission

275
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,360
can merge with the other team's Queen.

276
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,900
What's merge?

277
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,530
- What?
- Merge?

278
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,700
- This is only two servings.
- It's only for two people?

279
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,010
The queen that wins the mission

280
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,100
can divide the food according to
the order of people they like.

281
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,610
The last person might not even
get a drop of soup.

282
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,360
First, the queen will eat
and then choose the order.

283
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,240
We can eat the leftovers...

284
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,300
You can eat this after
you complete the mission.

285
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
What's the mission?

286
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,240
Flip the cushion.

287
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,760
Each representative comes to the board

288
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,850
and they have to flip the cushions
that matches their side

289
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,900
The team that flips the most cushions
by the time limit will get a point.

290
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,590
It's the mission that Jong Kook won
by pinning me down last time!

291
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,440

Soyu, if you don't win,
we're done...

294
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,390
Jong Kook carried me
and flipped all of them before.

295
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,150
There's a high chance that it will
happen again, so you have to win.

296
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,900
First, we will have the queens' battle.

297
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,700
If you meet her halfway,
just do whatever you want.

298
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,640
Take your hat off!

299
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,610
Soyu, do a dance first!

300
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,300
- Dance first.
- What were our choreography...

310
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,130

00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,870
[She aims for the buzzer beater.]

341
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,960
[Both flips were a fail.]

342
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,360
- One, two, three...
- We won!

343
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,990
[Ten?]

344
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,610
- It's ten.
- It's ten.

345
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,900
You guys tied.
You have to go again.

346
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,500
[Tied game]

347
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,640
This is really hard!

348
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,010
Bomi's slide at the end!

349
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,560
Bomi, would you like a beer?

350
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,410
[No thank you.]

351
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,960
[Team Bomi vs. team Soyu.]
We meet again!

352
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,870
I'll show you how to play this game.

353
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,810
This game has a solution.

354
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,360
[The flip game...]
[It's easy if you know the theory.]

355
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,470
- Jae Suk!
- That's why I told you to win.

356
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,010
What do we do...

357
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,810
[I won't lose twice...
beware, Kim Jong Kook!]

358
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,240
He's scary.

359
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,500
Jae Suk!
Get low!

360
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,250
[Where do you think you're going?]

361
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,740
[Lift]

362
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,990
Jae Suk!

363
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,670
[Flip the cushion is so easy.]
Soyu!

364
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,040
Get out of there!

365
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,130
[Swing, swing]

366
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,100
I didn't know it would be this bad!

367
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,840
[I didn't know either...]

368
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,330
[A strike to the face]

369
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm so upset!

370
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,990
[Flip]

371
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,590
[He's doing his best
in his limited condition.]

372
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,210
Jae Suk, come down!

373
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,730
I can't!

374
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,760
[It's impossible to get down.]
What do we do?

375
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,240
[Poke, poke]

376
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,100
You're crazy!
[Game over!]

377
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,640
How do you win this?

378
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,410
This doesn't make any sense!
[Second round: 13 to 7.]

379
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,700
Is this fair?

380
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,610
- We're good to go!
- We lost one game.

381
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,870
[How will round three turn out?]

382
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,640
[What's the mission for premium beef?]

383
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,100
The first battle is
the backward step long jump.

384
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Backward?

385
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,590
Each team takes turns five times.

386
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,840
[Add the scores and the team
with the highest collective score wins.]

387
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,960
I'm actually really light.
Look.

388
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,010
[For their motivation]
Not yet!

389
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,100
They put a slice of beef!

390
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,730
They're stimulating us!

391
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,330
[Bling, bling, marbling,
I will eat you today.]

392
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,330
[First round of backward
long jump, Kwang Soo.]

393
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,870
[Sloppy, sloppy]
This is really weird...

394
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,930
- How should I do it?
- You know what?

395
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,410
That's useless
when you jump backward.

396
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,330
- What do I do?
- That only helps when you jump forward.

397
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,100
You have to do it the opposite way!

398
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,900
- You know less than a girl?
- She's my queen.

399
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,210
You are qualified as a queen!

400
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,240
Kwang Soo!

401
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,390
Challenge!

402
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,360
[He jumped!]

403
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,330
[That was a jump?]
Are you serious?

404
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,100
That's it?

405
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
Stop kidding around!

406
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,270
Try it yourself!

407
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,270
[He's not useful of his long legs.]

408
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,990
- I can jump more than you!
- Try it!

409
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,590
I thought he was a ballerino.

410
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,390
He lifted his feet up like this!

411
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,010
[The biggest humiliation]

412
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,500
If you just jump, I think you'll
go further than Kwang Soo.

413
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,010
- It's weird.
- Achoo!

414
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,900
[It's almost the same as Kwang Soo.]

415
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,210
It's so weird.
This is harder than I thought.

416
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,560
How did you pass one meter?

417
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,900
- Gook Joo, you have to win.
- I think I can do this.

418
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,640
I think she's going to jump
further than both of you.

419
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,410
[I'm ready.]

420
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,850
Gook Joo, the meat's done already!

421
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,840
[If you don't hurry,
it might get tougher...]

422
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,040
[I'll hurry and eat it up.]

423
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,940
One, two, three!

424
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,650
[Powerful jump!]

425
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,790
[Fly, Gook Joo!]

426
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,990
She jumped more than you did!

427
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,100
[50 centimeters is beyond their capacity.]

428
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,730
We failed.

429
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,210
Challenge!

430
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,410
She did it!

431
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,380
[One meter?]

432
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,580
[Oh my god!]

433
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,960
[That's like Bora... what?]

434
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,590
[One step forward]

435
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,100
It's right here! Here!

436
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,670
We're safe!
We can eat!

437
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,730
[You crossed the line...]
That's too bad!

438
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,790
It's here!

439
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,390
[Bora's mistake,
her measurement is 0 cm.]

440
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,100
[Who will win the premium beef?]

441
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
[What about the mission for
chicken soup with ginseng?]

442
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,930
[Tie the drumstick
and eliminate the name tags.]

443
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,810
Tie the drumstick?

444
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,530
You have to roll a dice with
various types of gloves written on it.

445
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,640
You need to wear the gloves you roll.

446
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
You then have to take off
the opponent's name tag to win.

447
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,330
Please get mittens!
Mittens!

448
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,140
[Team Purple gets mittens.]

449
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,560
[Devastated]

450
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,500
We're doomed!

451
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,640
How did I get this?

452
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,990
- Seol Hyun will roll it for me.
- Get mittens!

453
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,990
[What will Seol Hyun roll for Gary?]

454
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,390
Scrubbing gloves!

455
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,270
[We screwed up!]

456
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,990
Mittens are better
than scrubbing gloves!

457
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,190
We selected the two worst ones.

458
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,900
How do you use this?

459
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,790
This is actually not that bad.

460
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,050
I think I can win.

461
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,190
Coming from Suk Jin,
it wounds my pride.

462
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,530
Okay!

463
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,330
[The first round of Tie the Drumstick.]

464
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,440
- Don't play 'Push the Palm'!
- I'm not!

465
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,010
[Sudden attack]

466
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,010
I'm not striking the palm!

467
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,150
[Risky]

468
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,790
I'm going to win!

469
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,440
I'm also going to win!

470
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,840
Go, Gary!

471
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,190
[Grab]

472
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,910
[Will the game end like this?]

473
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,960
[Name tag elimination
with scrubbing gloves?]

474
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,360
[He ripped it!]

475
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,700
[Big Nose...]

476
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,620
[Queen Seol Hyun's team
wins the first round.]

477
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,900
There was no surprise.

478
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,640
[Seol Hyun got scrubbing gloves.]

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,190
[and Ji Hyo got ski gloves.]

480
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,960
Fighting, Ji Hyo!

481
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,640
This is such a burden.

482
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,270
[Queen Seol Hyun vs. Queen Ji Hyo.]

483
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,760
- Fighting!
- Ji Hyo!

484
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,100
[Round two, start!]

485
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,960
[Will it be the ambitious Seol Hyun
or the expert Ji Hyo?]

486
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,730
[Which Queen will win this round?]
Very good!

487
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,470
[Close match]

488
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,530
That's it!
First, grab her...

489
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,300
[Head down]

490
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,300
[Pull, then rip!]

491
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,200
[Ji Hyo won the second round!]

492
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,190
Don't ask her if she's okay
after pulling her head!

493
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,070
I thought it was watching the UFC!

494
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,730
[I'm sorry I'm competitive...]
I'm okay!

495
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,360
Why do you act like this
when Seol Hyun's here?

496
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,010
I'm so sorry, Seol Hyun!

497
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,640
<i>Let's have a dance battle!</i>

498
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,330
I'm really sorry...

499
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,560
But go entertain yourself somewhere else!

500
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,840
Why are you trying to
amuse yourself here?

501
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,590
This is insane!

502
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,160
We're doing okay!

503
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,210
- I don't want to!
- Or go eat something else then!

504
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,300
[The last round for two points.]

505
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,530
This is the final round.

506
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,190
Ready, set!

507
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,840
[Start!]

508
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,500
[Collect all the cushions!]

509
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,560
[Attack!]

510

[The Lifting Ghost is back.]

[Lifts]

512
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,640
[Transformed into hot pants!]
What are you doing?

513
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,120
[If you don't put me down]

514
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,900
[I'll pull your pants up to
your shoulders.]

515
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,360
Are you crazy?

516
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,440
[The victory is in the Queens' hands!]

517
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,700
You're crazy!

518
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,700
[This time, it's a crop top!]

519
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,930
Soyu, come here!
This is the only solution!

520
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,100
[Free hugs everywhere.]
Soyu!

521
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,900
My back hurts!
It pricks!

522
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,040
[Time's up!]

523
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,900
[Flip the cushion is now over.]

524
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,270
How did it turn out?

525
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,810
[Seven facing up,
thirteen facing down.]

526
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,870
We won!

527
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,360
[Queen Soyu won!]

528
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,300
[Meaningless]
Unexpectedly...

529
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,240
Bomi's jaw is out.
She's angry.

530
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,960
The Queen that won the mission
can merge terms.

531
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,930
Bomi, please give your armband
to Queen Soyu.

532
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,870
[Queen Bomi is now a member
of Queen Soyu's team.]

533
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,900
You have to change into blue clothes.

534
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,700
Go change!

535
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,040
You'll look like a magnet!

536
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,500
[At the same time, at the
premium beef restaurant...]

537
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,870
[They jump...]

538
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,790
[and jump.]
Good job!

539
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,560
If you're going to fall, fall backward!

540
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,870
[Team Bora is at a disadvantage
because of her 0 cm.]

541
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,590
She's a good jumper.

542
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,670
[She reached one meter!]

543
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,610
That scared me!
[He almost broke his nose.]

544
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,610
- My forehead!
- You're crazy!

545
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,530
[Bora's team is at advantage.]
How is it possible?

546
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,910
[But Team Gook Joo has another chance!]

547
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,160
[We need to end this with our jump.]

548
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,360
- I'm going for real.
- Kwang Soo, shake it!

549
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,240
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it!

550
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,700
[The pronunciation
sounds a bit like a curse...]

551
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,840
I was just advertising my new song!

552
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,100
Kwang Soo, it's kind of addicting.
Kwang Soo, shake it!

553
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,760
Shake it, shake it!

554
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,390
[She's having fun.]

555
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,040
- I'm cheering for you!
- It's not cheerful at all!

556
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,700
What are you doing!
[What about this?]

557
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,040
Kwang Soo, I only have this left...

558
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,840
[Why are you so far...]
Just wait.

559
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,190
Just close your eyes.

560
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,990
What are you going to do?

561
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,840
- This works, right?
- Yeah, you saw earlier!

562
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,040
[Anxious, anxious]

563
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,250
Shake it, shake it, shake it!

564
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,160
- I'm ready!
- One...

565
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,410
Two, blast off!

566
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,930
[This is probably...]

567
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,000
[the end of my life...]

568
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,130
[Go, jumping booster!]

569
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,410
[High forehead!]

570
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,870
[He risked his life for that jump?]

571
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,070
His heart hurts...

572
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,160
His body is also hurt...

573
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,190
Why did you strike down?

574
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,410
You have to aim up, not down!

575
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,160
Did you hit me with your bone?

576
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,870
If you hit my ear,
my eardrum would've ripped apart!

577
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,840
You should have jumped further!

578
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,730
[Five scores vs. four scores.]

579
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,390
[Which team has the highest score?]

580
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,840
- We can't predict.
- It's done!

581
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,330
We will announce the results.

582

Team Green has a total of

583
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,040
291 cm.

584
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,900
Team Yellow only has four scores.

585

[The premium beef is ours!]

589
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,330
Now your Queen is Bora.

590
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,410
You must obey the Queen

591
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,810
and change your clothes.

592
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,790
That's a harder mission for Gook Joo!

593
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,390
It takes me three hours to change.

594
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,330
Change into these.

595
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,410

and Team chicken soup with ginseng.]

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:55,960
- Can I have some lemon-lime soda?
- I'll get you some!

599

[The Queen can choose the order
and the amount of food to divide.]

600
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,590
That's no fun!

601
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,040
You have to make the Queen entertained.

602
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,960
[She's full of rhythm already.]

603
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,470
Congratulations on becoming the Queen!

604
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,130
Where did it go?

605
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,190
I want to drink this.

606
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,790
It's the first time
I've seen a woman do this!

607

[She's making the noise with her mouth.]

608
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,700
Is it refreshing?
Of course!

609

Showing off your charm!

610
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,730
Is there any rice?

611
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,410
[Immediately at your service.]
You can't just give it to her!

612
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,240
Did you just call me 'Sir'?

613
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,100
There are pieces stuck at the bottom.

614
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,240
You have to shake it.

615
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,810
So it's clean.
What are you doing?

616
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,810
When you eat, you have
to eat with Gook Joo.

617
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,330
You must eat the victory onions as well.

618
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,610
[My mouth is full of premium beef.]

619
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,820

00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,660
But I wish the Queen would stop now.

623
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,300
You might have to eat
in the next game, too.

624
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,100
- I'll eat again.
- We can all eat together.

And you're the youngest, so be quick.

629
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,100
No, I'm the Queen so don't
tell him what to do!

630
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,500
[Backs down]
He needs strength.

631
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,910
Eat a lot because you need
to use your strength.

632
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,470
I'm feeling a little upset.

633
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,210

- You gave me the tail?
- Yes, you can only have that.

after gaining authority!

642

Jong Kook and Bomi,
you guys aren't even looking at me!

643

- You really like the pumpkin.
- He's a pumpkin maniac.

644

- What do you mean 'ma'am'?
- You're too much!

She's the middle-aged Queen lady!

647

- I'll take my share first.
- The Queen's first.

[Imprudent]

653
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,720
Take this away!

You have to do what the Queen says!

- I'm going to draw it.
- If you're going to do it, do it now!

662

- Do it now!
- If you bring it, I'll do it now!

Okay?
Go do it.

667

- Is she eating already?
- It's already done.

692
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,190

[Finishing touches]

695
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,470
You didn't leave me one piece?

696
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,210
I was in a hurry.
I was really hungry, sorry.

697
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,410
Do you think I wanted to do this?
I'm still a woman.

698
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,010
You're more handsome like that.

699
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,130
Let's go Ha Ha, let's go Queen.

700
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,470
Let's go!

701
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,760

- Jae Suk, you guys merged!
- Yeah!

705
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,790
- I grabbed Jong Kook with one arm.
- You?

706
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,730
I suppressed him, and then
pressed his knee down!

707
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,210
Is it true?
He's all shy now that you've said that.

708
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,640
- I pressed his knee down.
- Soyu did all the work.

709
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,870
Bora!

710
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,900

emerging with Team Gook Joo.]

712

She's good.

713
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,960
There have been rumors that
you tried really hard today!

714
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,730
It's no joke today.

715
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,190
[Victory for Queen Seol Hyun!]
I will merge everyone to Team Orange!

716
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,100
Are sure it's not pink
instead of orange?

717
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,870
Oh my god!

718
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,530

[I can't believe it...

721
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,840

[All three teams enter
the water park together.]

[This is a huge rice bowl?]

725
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,470
There's fish!

726
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,440
- Is it sushi?
- It's rice with sliced raw fish!

727
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,240
Is it rice with sliced raw fish?

728
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,190
[What do you use this for?]

729
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,130
This is the second mission of the race.

730
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,670
It's the rice bowl fight.

731
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,700
Everyone will be dancing
in the bowl together.

732
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,010
When the whistle blows

733
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,300
you have to push your
opponents out of the bowl.

734
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,060
After the time limit passes

735
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,810
the team that has the most members
left standing will win.

736
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,100
[Woohoo!]

737
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,240
Who's going to push me?

738
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,390
[Mission impossible]

739
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,990
Who's going to lift Gook Joo?

740
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,730
I'm not lying but when
I fell into the water

741
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,590
four people couldn't even lift me.

742
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,730
Sorry, but everyone should help
in lifting Gook Joo first.

743
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,440
First Gook Joo, then Jong Kook.

744
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,100
[Try if you can.]

745
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,960
I'll just play a big part in this.

746
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,670
He's the youngest on our team!

747
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,590
Jong Kook's the youngest?

748
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,590
Your youngest member is cute.

749
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,590
I am cute, right?
[I'll show you how cute I am!]

750
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,590
One out of the three teams
will win by default.

751
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,590
That's advantageous!

752
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,590
That's intense!

753
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,270
The third team's queen
has to return the armband.

754
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,840
Along with the rest of her members,
they will be merged to one of the teams.

755
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,130
They will be split?

756
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,640
Gary and Seol Hyun
could be separated, too.

757
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,350
Is that so?

758
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,950
You can't separate our hearts
just by physically splitting us up.

759
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,040
The person that Gary liked before
and now are in one team.

760
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,410
I feel weird to be in this team.

761
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,390
Three queens will play
rock-paper-scissors.

762
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,390
We'll pick one team that
will advance to the finals now.

763
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,040
Queens, you'll play
rock-paper-scissors.

764

[Her team goes to the finals.]

769

[Queen Soyu vs. Queen Seol Hyun]

773
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,000
It's hard to fight against Jong Kook.

1040
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,790
The thing is, even if one team
puts their flags on a post

1041
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,900
the other team can try the same mission
and switches it with their own flag.

1042
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,070
- Both of them are SISTAR members.
- Open it.

1043
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,790
That's the queen card.

1044
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:48,930
If you use the queen card,
it will double the number of flags.

1045
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,640
We can use it only once.

1046
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,270
If you fail the mission,
the card will be discarded.

1047
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,440
We need to keep it for something
that we're confident in.

1048
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,930
I have a good feeling.

1049
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,990
You can run around the flags and check.

1050
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,270
Get ready.

1051
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,440
Let's go check out
what the missions are first.

1052
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,670
It starts from this moment,
ready, set...

1053
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,670
[Capture the flag, starts!]
Go!

1054
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,790
[They need to find
where the missions are.]

1055
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:21,480
There are missions for three flags
and for one flag.

1056
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,470
- Do you understand?
- We need to just find flags?

1057
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,700
No, we'll get flags
when we succeed missions.

1058
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,640
Will there be any missions
that I'm good at?

1059
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,870
What are you talking about?
We'll do it whatever that is!

1060
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,130
We can try something else
if we can't do it.

1061
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,760
What is that?

1062
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,160
What did you find?

1063
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,300
Here it is!
[Gook Joo and Kwang Soo find it first.]

1064
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,900
Three persons, mixed gender!

1065
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,360
[A mission for two flags.]

1066
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:53,190
Go down the water slide
and spot three numbers.

1067
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,900
[From a 20-meter height...]
Don't we have to walk up?

1068
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,300
[find three hidden numbers!]

1069
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,440
There are three numbers on the slide.

1070
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,010
Do you think you can do it?

1071
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,440
- Hurry up and go!
- Let's go!

1072
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,270
Ji Hyo, Bomi, and Gary!

1073
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,870
- Go try this mission.
- Succeed it quickly!

1074
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,120
Let's go somewhere else.

1075
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,500
Isn't going up the slide
harder than the mission?

1076
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,100
- Don't give up.
- I don't think I can.

1077
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,980
- Gook Joo, hurry up!
- Getting there is the mission.

1078
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,850
This is the real mission.

1079
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,160
It's too far!
My legs are tired.

1080
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,810
I want to try something else.

1081
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,190
But I can do it!

1082
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,100
[Jae Suk finds another mission.]

1083
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,870
A person on the ride shots a ball

1084
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,730
and the other person catches it.
Catch three times.

1085
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,130
Mixed gender and no limit on
the number of persons.

1086
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,300
It'll shoot us 10 meters high.

1087
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,530
I'll catch the ball.

1088
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,900
[Will it be okay to sit here?]

1089
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,070
Catch it well, Soyu!

1090
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,010
Throw it as far as possible!

1091
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,590
Jong Kook!

1092
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,760
It won't be scary, right?

1093
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,530
['My Ball', Queen Soyu
needs to catch three balls.]

1094
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,130
Get ready, it'll shoot you forward.

1095
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,130
[Flying Grasshopper]

1096
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,560
[He threw the ball!]

1097
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,670
[It's too hard to catch it.]

1098
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,440
[Splash!]

1099
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,810
What are you doing?

1100
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,590
Soyu, what is this?

1101
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,530
What's going on?

1102
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,990
[While Grasshopper
was flying in the sky...]

1103
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:02,900
[he laid an egg.]

1104
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,210
[The second runner is Kkuk.]

1105
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,250
[Shots from a free throw position!]

1106
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,990
[The ball traces better than Yoo Hyuk's.]

1107
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,060
[Again, it was too short!]

1108
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,190
What happened?

1109
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,240
Hurry up, Jae Suk!

1110
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,560
[While Queen Soyu is busy
catching balls...]

1111
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,440
[What is Queen Bora doing?]

1112
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,470
[She finds a new mission zone
with Haroro.]

1113
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,810
Get the jump rope from
the bottom of the pool.

1114
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:45,440
Stand on the floating disc and
jump five times with your partner.

1115
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:51,990
[Within five tries,
jump five times in a row!]

1116
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:55,390
[Getting the jump rope
at the bottom of the pool.]

1117
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:00,190
[It's hard to stand on
the floating disc.]

1118
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:01,700
[The first attempt]

1119
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,240
[Splash!]

1120
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,840
[There's a reason why
it's worth three flags.]

1121
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,010
Let's do it!
[The second attempt]

1122
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,480
[Steps on]

1123
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,330
- You stepped on my foot!
- I'm sorry!

1124
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,330
[The third attempt]

1125
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,930
[Goodbye, Ha Ha!]

1126
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,010
[He saves the queen.]

1127
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,810
Let's do something else!

1128
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,760
[They can try two more times,
but they give up.]

1129
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,130
- It's lucky to fail the first mission.
- Why do you keep falling?

1130
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:59,360
- It's cold, my butt is wet!
- Put your legs straight.

1131
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,130
[Go down the water slide
and catch three numbers.]

1132
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,610
[The boat moves.]

1133
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:10,500
Oh, my, my. Mother!

1134
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,240
[Why is this boat so heavy?]

1135
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,590
Mother!
[Scream]

1136
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,730
[It speeds up and goes down
through the tunnel.]

1137
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,870
[Where is the number?]

1138
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,700
[Water hits them from everywhere.]

1139
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:42,930
[Before finding any numbers,
they can barely keep their mind clear.]

1140
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,930
Where's the number?

1141
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:53,160
[Wait, is that the number?]

1142
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,700
[It's right there!]

1143
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,010
Four!

1144
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,960
[They said there are three numbers?]

1145
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,190
[The slide was fear-inducing.]

1146
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:12,070
- I never knew it was this scary!
- Where are the numbers?

1147
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,840
[Where are the other two numbers?]

1148
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,930
If you saw the numbers,
please tell me the three numbers.

1149
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,040
First of all, four!

1150
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,640
[Thinking]
Eighteen!

1151
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,070
- Gook Joo!
- Why?

1152
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,940
You need to pick a possible number!

1153
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,930
[This time, Team Blue attempts.]

1154
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,500

[Did Blank Ji see it?]

1158
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,130
- Five!
- Five!

1159

[It was a split second!]

1160

[Wait, that's...]

1161
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:15,350

on the side of the slide!]

in order to succeed.]

- Five, six, and seven!
- Did you see it?

01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,270
[They're very sure
they have the answer.]

you're really good at.

1211
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,900
But we don't know
what games we have.

1212
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,960
What is this?
Is it difficult?

1213
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,810
- Let's just pass by!
- Drink a lot, Suk Jin!

1214
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,390
[Team Blue wants to keep the advantage.]

1215
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:06,640
Who do we need to give this card to?
We want to use this card.

1216
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,560
[The queen card is being used for
the couple jump rope mission.]

1217
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,240
[If they succeed at it,
it will double the number of flags.]

1218
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,700
Gary, Bomi, we used up our queen card.
Do it well!

1219
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,390
Be careful!

1220
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,300
- Do you want to do without stopping?
- Yes.

1221
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:26,300
Just keep the same spot.

1222
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,210
[The first attempt]

1223
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,590
[They fail at the fourth jump.]

1224
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,300
It was close!

1225
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,210
We can do it, Bomi!

1226
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,900
[Their second attempt]

1227
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,130
[They're faster this time.]

1228
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,880
[They jumped four...]

1229
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,430
[Just one more jump...]

1230
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,870
[Wobble]
[and fall]

1231
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,100
[Why does this always happen
after their fourth jump?]

1232
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,240
Let's focus until the last one.

1233
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,390
[Their third attempt]

1234
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:15,070
[Stable footwork]

1235
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:19,330
[Six flags depend on this jump!]

1236
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,870
[Success!]

1237
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:34,440
[Team Blue succeeds at
the couple jump rope.]

1238
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,810
[We've seized the chance to victory!]

1239
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,160
[They've acquired six flags at once.]

1240
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,870
[The current state of flags]

1241
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,160
[The gap between the two teams
has increased.]

1242
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,960
We don't have much time left.

1243
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,500
What are you doing?

1244
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,760
Come over here.
Let's try this!

1245
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,100
We'll challenge that!

1246
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:03,090
One, two, three!
[Seol Hyun flies!]

1247
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,330
[She threw the ball.]

1248
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:11,300
I've got it!

1249
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,390
Are you okay?
Can you throw two more?

1250
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:18,190
You received it?
I'll do it!

1251
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,670
What's going on?

1252
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,930
[Elegance]

1253
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:27,190
[She ties up her hair...]

1254
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,810
[and gets ready to shot the ball.]

1255
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,560
[The second shot]

1256
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:45,070
[Nice catch!]

1257
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,500
One more!

1258
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,790
Seol Hyun, you're cool!
You look like a mermaid!

1259
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,670
[While Seol Hyun is
showing off her graceful beauty...]

1260
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,100
[Giraffe is having a hard time.]

1261
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,140
[Stack up a can tower
of five cans on the tray.]

1262
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,580
[Man carries Woman on his shoulder]

1263
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:07,010
[while Woman stacks up
five cans on the tray.]

1264
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:10,950
Where did the tray go?
[It has to stay for 3 seconds.]

1265
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,560
[The tray is far away from them.]

1266
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,130
Let me do it!

1267
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:19,670
[Queen Bora is urgently deployed.]

1268
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:22,500
[Gook Joo exits the mission zone.]

1269
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,500
What is this?

1270
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,010
Was this mission this easy?

1271
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,870
[With Queen Bora,
the horse gets fast.]

1272
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:35,990
[It has to stay standing
for three seconds.]

1273
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,730
[Success!]

1274
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:44,390
[Team Yellow begins
their counterattack.]

1275
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:48,930
[Team Yellow wins one flag.]

1276
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,930
I'll throw it!

1277
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,390
[They'll succeed at it
if Ha Ha catches one more ball.]

1278
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,700
[He received it!]

1279
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:10,270
[Team Yellow succeeds at
'My Ball Mission.']

1280
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,050
[The current state of flags]

1281
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,640
[Finally, Team Yellow's
counterattack is working!]

1282
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,390
Let's hurry up and go!

1283
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,590
Aren't you good at it?

1284
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:28,300
[They run to the slide mission zone
at full speed.]

1285
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,390
This is 'Running Man'!

1286
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,810
Just get on the boat!

1287
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,970
It's almost there, Bomi!

1288
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:41,330
[Bomi is wearing the straw
and drinks out of it.]

1289
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,440
[The flag is switched to Team Blue's.]

1290
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:49,130
[Let me absorb the juice!]

1291
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,810
Little more, it's almost there!

1292
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:53,610
That's right!
You did it!

1293
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:58,010
[The yellow flag is back to its place.]

1294
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:01,840
I think we can do this in the end.
When we feel thirsty.

1295
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:07,300
That's very smart!

1296
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,930
[Team Yellow tries
the water slide mission again.]

1297
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:17,340
[We must see the numbers!]

1298
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,330
[Right now!]

1299
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:26,010
[The first number!]

1300
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,900
[Work with your eyes
and catch the number!]

1301
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:36,390
[That's the second number?]

1302
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,390
Three, three, three, three!

1303
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,190
It's eight!

1304
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:49,540
[They spotted all three numbers!]

1305
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,240
[The saw the three numbers correctly.]

1306
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,650
[Team Yellow acquires two more flags.]

1307
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,410
We don't have much time.
You need to do this.

1308
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:08,860
[We're winning and
we have five minutes.]

1309
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:12,360
Currently, the teams are tied!

1310
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,760
What?

1311
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,300
[The current state of flags]
Hurry up!

1312
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,010
[Either of the teams that wins
another mission will win.]

1313
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,240
[Team Blue is simultaneously playing
the water slide and stack the tower.]

1314
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,670
[Team Yellow is playing jump rope.]

1315
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:34,300
Hurry up!

1316
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,040
[Team Yellow uses
the queen card.]

1317
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,700
[If they succeed at it,
it will double the number of flags.]

1318
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,130
[It's their last chance!]

1319
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:49,470
[If they win the six flags,
they can win the mission.]

1320
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,070
[They're under great pressure.]

1321
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:57,160
[Their first attempt.]

1322
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,900
[Splash]

1323
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,700
[Even Team Yellow
can't avoid the curse of four.]

1324
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:14,040
[They have four more tries.]

1325
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,840
30 seconds left!

1326
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,300
Hold the four cans.

1327
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,330
[Maybe they can secure
their victory with this game.]

1328
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,760
[Team Blue going down
on the water slide.]

1329
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,360
The person sitting on this side
needs to see it.

1330
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,010
[The second attempt]

1331
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:41,010
[Let's calm down...]

1332
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,700
[They fail right before
their fifth jump.]

1333
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,040
Hurry up and go up again.

1334
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,700
[They only have about 80 seconds.]

1335
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,800
This is your last chance!

1336
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,700
[The team who wins the current mission
will win the race!]

1337
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:11,760
[Did Team Blue see the first number?]

1338
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,010
[And the second number is...]

1339
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,960
[I'm sure it's on the right side.]

1340
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,150
Three!

1341
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:27,120
[Team Blue spots the numbers one by one.]

1342
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,990
[Team Yellow's third attempt]

1343
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:38,300
[The fateful jump!]

1344
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:48,200
[Win this mission and win the race!]

1345
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,270
[They've seen two numbers already.]

1346
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,300
[The last number is...]

1347
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,330
[right here!]

1348
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,840
[Blank Ji saw it!]

1349
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,870
Seven, three, and one!

1350
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:14,100
[The only thing left
is to say the answer.]

1351
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:20,590
[Gary and Bomi constructed the tower.]

1352
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:24,590
[Keep it standing for three seconds...]

1353
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:29,190
[We will do it, no matter what!]

1354
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:35,040
Seven, three, and one!
Seven, three, and one!

1355
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,030
Seven, three, and one!

1356
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,270
Seven, three, and one?

1357
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:48,040
[Gary and Bomi's tower]
One, two...

1358
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,790
[It collapsed.]

1359
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:58,110
[The jump rope for six flags...]

1360
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,560
Seven, three, and one!

1361
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,070
[Is that the correct answer?]

1362
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,440
Seven, three, and one!

1363
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,840
Seven, three, and one!

1364
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:51,360
[Team Blue fails at
the water slide mission.]

1365
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,210
[What's wrong?]
Seven, three, and one!

1366
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:01,540
[If only Team Yellow succeeds...]

1367
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,900
[Just one more jump...]

1368
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,920
[No way!]

1369
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,440
[Team Yellow succeeds!]

1370
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,190
[They won the last mission
even with the queen card.]

1371
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:26,590
[They win the battle of pressure!]

1372
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:31,930
[Team Yellow acquires six flags.]

1373
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:36,130
[The current state of flags]

1374
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:42,140
[No one expected these results!]
Bora, Bora!

1375
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:46,130
[Team Blue was winning
until the midpoint.]

1376
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:52,270
[Team Yellow members
can't believe it themselves.]

1377
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,270
Seol Hyun, now you're smiling.

1378
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:59,960
[She smiles after she wins.]

1379
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:06,790
[Bora ascends the throne
as the Queen of Early Summer.]

1380
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:09,040
Aren't they too much?

1381
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,360
These are golden eggs.

1382
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,240
Let's share the joy!

1383
