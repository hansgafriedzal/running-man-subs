You're here?

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,740
In this drama, Ji Suk Jin
was my dying grandfather.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,530
A cool pose?
I can't do stuff like that!

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,630
He's no longer a cameo,
he's a multi-player, Gary!

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,660
[He acts with his muscles, Kkuk!]

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,430

I'm shy!
I'm shy for no reason!

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,890
Sorry.

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,730
I forgot she used to be slim and fit.

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,160
[Sometimes we forget,
but she is a beautiful top actress.]

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,930
- She's beautiful, though.
- Who is that?

[Another actress' visit.]

38
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,930
[A pure actress who seeks to be
the leading star in this drama.]

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,190
Of course, she's pretty.

We're friends,
we're the same age!

You're not friends,
you're just the same age!

48
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,450
[I was almost flustered...]

49

[And the last guest of the
production presentation!]

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,490
[We can catch the sight of
a leading actress's figure.]

51
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,960
This is so awkward...

on 'Running Man'?

58
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,520
- Yes.
- She hasn't been on a variety show...

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,460
Aren't you guys showing a fake reaction?

60
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,730
We were too surprised...

61
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,300
- It's been so long.
- It's been 16 years!

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,730
- On a variety show?
- Really?

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,660
Her first appearance?

64
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,630
When I first debuted in high school,
I was on a few variety shows.

65
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,630
[High-teen star, young Lee Yo Won.]

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,460

[That's the drama I'll be cast in?]

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,890
There are three characters in silhouettes.

72
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,360
This is a casting survival.
[Three leading stars will be cast!]

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,700
Oh, there are three leading roles?

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,590
- Oh, it's a competition.
- We're in three teams today.

75
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,130
Yes, I will now announce your teams.

76
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,430
First up, Yoo Jae Suk

77
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,760
Ha Ha

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
[What's with this combination?]

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,330
and Lee Yo Won.

80
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,090
We have the two main actor and actress,
and he's just a servant.

81
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,160
What are you saying, servant Lee?

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
[I hope our team's alright...]

83
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,230
Kim Jong Kook and Gary.

84
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,730
- It's been a while!
- And lastly, Cha Ye Ryun.

85
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,160
[The strongest team is born.]

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,630
Are we going to win today?

87
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,530
- The last members are a team.
- It's see-through Song, and the men.

88
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,560
[Kwang Soo, see-through Song,
and Big Nose.]

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,660
Oh, it's actual skin...

90
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,590
What's wrong with you?
He keeps looking at me with weird eyes!

91
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,690
- He said...
- It was actual skin!

92
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,460
I thought it was skin-colored fabric...

93
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,860
There are reporters,
so please restrain yourself.

94
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,360
[Once more, and I'll be kicked out...]

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,600
I've made my appearance
in different pieces of work.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,100
'Dachimawa Lee' and 'Wonderful Radio.'

97
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,980
[He was a cameo with Kkuk
as a drunk person.]

98
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,610
They were drunk people!

99
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,150
It was a minor role, but I am hoping
for the leading role in this drama.

100
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,720
I've made my appearance
in 'Younggu and the Alien Bulgoeri.'

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,090
That was my debut movie.

102
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,960
At the time, although I was in my twenties

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,400
I was cast as an elementary student.
I was a favorable actor to the director.

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,300
As you may know, I was also
in 'Queen of Housewives.'

105
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,370
And I was also a leading role
in a Banjun (plot twist) drama.

106
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,450
Anyway, I've already met Yo Won a long
time ago through another piece of work...

107
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,780
- With me?
- Yes.

108
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,120
[Embarrassed]

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
You might be unfamiliar

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,450
but this is how you do it
on variety shows.

111
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,420
I was actually thinking...

the leading roles!]

[They are heading to
the first mission site.]

117
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,080
Wow, there are lots of cameras.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,210
There are really no cameramen in the car.

119
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,120
You really haven't been on
variety shows for a long time.

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,290
But at home, I only watch variety shows.

121
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,660
- Really?
- Yeah, not dramas.

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,190
You like them, but you don't
go on them often?

123
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,390
I'm not good.

124
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,160
People usually like to observe
what they're not good at.

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,090
I feel like you have
a lot of stories to tell!

126

- No, no.

127
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,130
- When did you debut?
- At 18 years old.

128

All the guys loved your type.

129
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,260
I was popular among females.

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,030
Yo Won has a slight boy-ish feel.

131
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,130
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, that was it!

132
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,790
Don't I look more feminine on the outside?

133
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,460
Yeah!

134
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,760
- Wait, actually?
- Yes.

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,830
I normally get cast for those roles...

136
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,860
So my image is a little feminine.

137
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,530
Ye Ryun's always been pretty.

138
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,130
Yeah, of course.

139
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,660
Is Cha Ye Ryun your real name?

140
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,960
No, it isn't.

141

- Can I ask your real name?
- It's a guy name...

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,290
You probably know someone
around you with the same name.

143
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,890
It's Hyun Ho.

144
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,760
- Cha Hyun Ho?
- Park Hyun Ho.

145
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,790
It really is a guy name...

146
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,830
I know someone with that name!

147
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,240
I was going to react differently.

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,130
I was going to say 'it's not bad!'

149
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,690
But...

150
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,460
Cha Hyun Ho is at least okay.

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,290
- Can we just call you Hyun Ho?
- Yeah, let's do that!

152
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,230
Sure, then go ahead.

- really...
- She's good at talking.

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,890
There will be obstacles
appearing on the track.

172
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,470
However, two reps from each
team will be blindfoldeed

173
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,060
and take their place at the start line.

174
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,870
We will time them until they
both sit on the chair

175
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,690
after they've passed all the obstacles.

176
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,860
The third member will
stand on the platform

177
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,030
and yell out directions.

178
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,660
- Hyun Ho, did you get it?
- Two people

179
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,090
cover their eyes...

180
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,790
You come from both directions?

181
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,950
- Then I yell?
- Why do you think you're going to yell?

182
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,650
You guys aren't even curious?

183
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,540
We're a family.

184
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,430
If you aren't going to react,
come to the side.

185
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,730
Why are you standing in the middle?

186
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,660
Ask about what you're curious!

187
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,060
[The obstacles are being set up.]

188
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,730
[Different obstacles being
set up, installed, lifted.]

189
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,950
[The complete obstacle course.]

190
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,380
[Yo Won is on standby on the platform.]

191
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,720
- Do well!
- Good luck!

192
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,320
- Should we do one person at a time?
- We'll start with Jae Suk, first.

193
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,190
Ready, set!

194
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,700
Left!

195
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,460
Go over that!

196
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,890
'Go over that.'

197
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,190
- Oh this?
- Yes, go over that.

198
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,010
- This was...
- Yes, go over it again!

199
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,190
[Awkward]

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,030
- Just go over it!
- Are you wearing leggings?

201
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,430
- Leggings?
- Are they leggings or what?

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,390
[He looks more grasshopper-like]

203
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,220
That... what is that... limbo!

204
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,630
You need to limbo!

205
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,230
- Where is it?
- It's right in front of you.

206
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,860
- How does he do that?
- Keep going, keep going!

207
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Lower, with that position!

208
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,660
[He passed after a minor collision.]

209
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,030
Jump forward!

210
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,160
There's a hat above,
you need to wear it.

211
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,290
- Is it right above me?
- Yes, the hat is right there.

212
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,320
One, two, three, jump!

213
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,960
- Jump!
- Ow, it hurts!

214
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,390
[There's no way it'll work...]

215
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,630
My eyesight is horrible... come forward!

216
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,490
[You should have told me earlier!]

217
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,130
From my perspective,
the hat was right above him!

218
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,360
[Falter, falter]

219
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,660
Wear the hat!

220
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,330
Yo Won!

221
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,290
- I have to wear it on my own?
- Yes, now Ha Ha...

222
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,490
How many steps?

223
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,260
Just go to the table and there will be
lipstick, you have to put the lipstick on!

224
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,130
[A Spartan-like navigation.]

225
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,890
- Can't you tell me?
- Go farther!

226
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,930
Stop!

227
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,790
Right!
Straight!

228
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,960
Walk faster!

229
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,490
I can't see, Yo Won!

230
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,890
[Her explanations are simple,
but they work!]

231
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,290
Stop, stop!

232
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,360
Pop the balloon!

233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,890
You need to explain, kindly.

234
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,290
I can't see right now!

235
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,690
[But funny enough, they're
continuing the mission alone.]

236
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,190
She's not looking at you anymore!

237
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,590
Oh, I popped it!

238
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,730
Turn around, turn around!

239
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,130
Now come forward and sit on the chair!

240
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,530
[She's Spartan-like until the end.]

241
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,450
The audience might think I can see!

242
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,260
[Only Ha Ha's left now.]

243
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,130
There's an acupressure mat
and snack in front of you.

244
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,330
You eat it on your own!

245
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,200

[Lick, lick]

247
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,790
- You have to think about his height...
- You need to match...

248
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,870
Just grab it and eat it.

249
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,340
Don't be so cold!

250
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,130
[Yum]

251

- Go straight!
- You're good!

252
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,960
[She's amazing...]

253
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,830
Ha Ha, go closer!
There's a gourd.

254
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,060
Just crack it.

He cracked it!

258
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,290
- Do I find it on my own?
- Yes, there's a chair to sit on.

259

[Team Yo Won, round one clear.]

260

My throat hurts!

261
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,460
Yo Won uses the Spartan method!

262
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,530
She wants us to do everything on our own!

263
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,590
'Walk faster!'

[Why Do You Keep Changing

Ready, set!

268
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,360

269
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,830
Take one step.

270

- Another step.
- Suk Jin!

- Ho, ho!

[What are they saying?]

278
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,830
[This won't do.]

279
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,660
Stop there...

280
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,990
- What is he doing?
- What's he doing?

high-speed with his hands.]

[That's the Spartan-way!
That's my style!]

288

Check his eyes!
Make sure they're covered!

- What is he doing by himself?

296

347
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,430
[You want me to jump?]

348
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,430
[Jump]

349
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,860
[It's so chaotic]
Jump rope, three times!

350
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,830
Jump rope, three times!

351
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,330
- Who do I listen to?
- Isn't it a hula hoop?

352
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,530
- Do I stay still?
- Jump... hey!

353
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,960
Jump rope!

354
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,540
- Jump rope?
- Jump rope, three times!

355
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,940
[Giraffe isn't jumping,
but Impala's jumping instead.]

356
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,110
[This is driving me crazy...]

357
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,280
[Three minutes have passed...]

358
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,950
- Go... Kwang Soo, stop!
- Do I keep going?

359
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:53,130
- Go back, go back!
- Do I go back?

360
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,660
- Lee Kwang Soo, go backwards!
- Me?

361
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,570
- You said go back!
- No, not you!

362
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,270
Suk Jin, take five steps...

363
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,140
Lee Kwang Soo, stop there!

364
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,880
Lee Kwang Soo, stop right there!

365
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,540
You told me to go backwards!

366
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,750
Suk Jin, take one step forward.

367
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,880
Yeah... like that.
It fell!

368
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,050
Squat and lift it back up!

369
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,490
- Lift what?
- Yeah, that!

370
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,330
Suk Jin...

371
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,730
[Lift]
Put it down!

372
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,200
[He's weightlifting instead of
getting through the obstacle.]

373
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,100
[How do I explain this...]

374
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,170
[It's already been seven minutes.]

375
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,440
Oh my god!
This acupressure mat!

376
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,940
[They both got to the acupressure mat...]

377
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,980
- What's there?
- Lift your left arm up!

378
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,450
Backwards!
You see the snack, right?

379
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,520
- You see the snack, right?
- How can I see the snack!

380
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,020
[Oops]
How can I see?

381
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,460
[Where did they go wrong...]

382
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,630
[He succeeds in eating the
snack like a real giraffe.]

383
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,730
- It hurts!
- I ate it!

384
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,200
Grab it, get up, and throw it up!

385
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,740
- No, not like that!
- What is this?

386
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,080
[Oh my, my]

387
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,910
What are you doing!

388
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,730
- Where is it, here?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,090
- That's it!
- Okay, you did it!

390
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,730
[He keeps throwing without
knowing it's already open.]

391
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,890
Suk Jin, it's open already!

392
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,560
[Please stop, it's open...]
Stop already!

393
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,460
Do you feel it in front of your knees?

394
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,890
Grab the table, slowly.
Try touching the surface.

395
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,060
There should be lipstick on top.

396
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,160
[Her composure dropped
down with the lipstick...]

397
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,790
Tell me beforehand, that there's lipstick!

398
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,860
[This is my limit...]

399
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,590
Take a huge step back, just like that.

400
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,930
Suk Jin, crack it on the floor.

401
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,830
[Their mission finally ended
after 16 minutes...]

402
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,990
[Sponsor: Running stone bed]

403
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,540
[The war started!]

404
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,800
[A gruesome struggle to be cast.]

405
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,590
[The long journey for the casting call.]

406
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,460
[Whatever happens,
I'm going to be the leading role!]

407
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,260
[Why Do You Keep
Changing Your Couple Ring?]

408
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,060
- But we still got first place.
- Yeah.

409
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,060
- I didn't even expect it.
- You were good!

410
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,990
It was a pretty simple game.

411
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,800
[Yo Won's Sparta-like
'do it yourself' method.]

412
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I really did it on my own.

413
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,390
'Do it on your own!'

414
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,990
If I just tell you what's
in front of you...

415
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,360
Yeah, it was a good method.

416
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,660
[The rest is up to you.]
It was a great method.

417
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,360
I think we can take it easy today.

418
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,390
We have two chances at the moment.

419
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,730
- It's very important.
- Yeah.

420
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,850
I... don't give very good reactions...

421
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,890
When I act, I don't improvise at all.

422
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,860
I just stick to the script.

423
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,730
'Do it yourself' was really good, though.

424
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,490
- She's perfect for variety shows.
- Yeah, she's perfect.

425
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,430
Hyun Ho, I think you're the wild type.

426
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,990
Do you get along well with guys?

427
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,060
Yes, I have many guy friends.

428
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:49,660
I become friends with everyone.

429
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,430
Do you go to a cafe

430
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,730
and or like an americano...

431
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,030
You want to drink with me?

432
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,690
What do you mean?
Is this the start of a love line?

433
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,670
- Hyun Ho, just wait a bit.
- Yes, Hee Gun.

434
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,150
I had a weird feeling!
I don't know what to do!

435
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,290

To receive love from
the always trendy public

442
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,990
- you need to pay attention to style.
- Style!

443

There's a fashionista here.

444
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,130
So, the second mission is
'Complete the actress' style.'

445
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,660
The four photo zones are
black, green, yellow, and pink.

446
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,460
We will choose the order for each team.

447
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,130
You have to dance to the
music until the whistle blows.

448
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,660
The guys have to jump in the water

449
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,590
and collect the right colored
clothing for your team.

450
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,590
You have to wear the clothes,
and throw it to the female teammate

451
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,360
and head to the right zone.

452
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,530
At the photo zone,
we will take your picture.

453
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,890
The first team to get
all four pictures, wins.

454
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,060
Jong Kook's team is too strong!

[Mr. Capable, Fashionista,
and Mr. Random Capable.]

456

But Jong Kook might not
fit into the clothes.

457
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,420
Could you prepare a triple XL?

00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,490
[What do we do with that muscle monster?]

459
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,660
We will throw the clothes
you will be wearing.

460
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,060
Be quiet!

461
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,930
It'll start when I blow the whistle!

462
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,190
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

463
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,660

When you hear the whistle,
you can say the line.

Then we'll show you the amount
of money you need to collect inside.

702
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,030
There's so much pressure.
What should I do?

703
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,690
They set up a glass box.

704

00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,260
[It's too late.]

861
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,990
[Let me squeeze it out.]

862
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,790
[Squeeze]

863
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,790
[Gushing]

864
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,790
[His muscles move.]

865
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:20,100
[Every time his muscles contract,
water flows in the jar.]

866
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,400
[Oh, no!]

867
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,690
[His muscles are alive!]

868
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,090
[He's squeezing every drop of water.]

869
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,480
It was good this time, Ye Ryun!

870
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,060
[Is he really a human?]
That'll do.

871
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:47,730
[Will Dehydrator Kkuk
can reverse the result?]

872
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,230
[He did it!]

873
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:56,370
[Team Ye Ryun passes the second stage,
the temptation of the water slap.]

874
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,790
We did it!

875
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,360
Can we go to the next stage?

876
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,890
[Teams leave the stage
when another team arrives.]

877
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,230
You're my brother.
What's your name?

878
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,180
- I'm Kwang Jae.
I'm Kwang Soo.

879
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,960
- Ji Suk Jin is the main actor.
- I am?

880
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,990
You're the nephew.
Remove the lid.

881
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,530
You see there's a piece of watermelon.

882
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,560
Say the line in the script
and attach a seed on your face.

883
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,260
- When all of you succeed at it...
- We'll pass, okay!

884
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,590
You'll fail if anyone's seed falls.

885
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,990
Don't allow the marriage, Father.

886
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:31,490
- I'm going to marry her.
- You shouldn't!

887
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,170
- He shouldn't.
- Everyone should oppose it.

888
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,860
- You can practice the line.
- I'm really bad at this.

889
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,190
Father, please allow us to marry.

890
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,590
- She did it!
- Pass!

891
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,560
[Why are they so noisy?]

892
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,900
[Team Ye Ryun enters the stage.]
I'll never allow you!

893
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,530
I'll never allow you!

894
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,490
[They keep acting.]

895
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,330
Say it like you're acting.

896
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,130
He did it!

897
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,290
I'm sorry, let me...
Help him, Ji Hyo.

898
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,090
We can't drop it!

899
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,520
[It's Kwang Soo's turn.]

900
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,760
What a shame on our family!
[Huh?]

901
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,260
[He shoots out the seed.]

902
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,790
[Ruined!]

903
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,830
[You're the shame on our team.]

904
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,390
[Their first attempt fails.]

905
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,730
[Team Ye Ryun starts street casting.]

906
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,860
- Can you do it?
- I can do it!

907
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,160
Why did you shave your hair off?

908
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,960
- Elementary student?
- Right there!

909
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,130
- Can you do it?
- Yes!

910
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,560
He looks like he can do it.

911
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,760
All our members look energetic.

912
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,130
Someone in their 50s.

913
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,460
Are you in your 50s?

914
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,660
Are you in your 60s?

915
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,790
- Honey!
- Your husband is here, too?

916
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,160
- Is your husband in his 50s, too?
- Yes.

917
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,160
[Good luck!]
Why don't you come here?

918
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,560
- Let's be our mother.
- Hello!

919
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,360
[Team Yo Won arrives at the stage.]
Your husband should come.

920
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,450
[They start casting
as soon as they arrive.]

921
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,290
Is there any elementary student?

922
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,460
Are you in your 20s?

923
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,830
[She cast one right away.]
Thank you.

924
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,890
[Team Ye Ryun's family starts acting.]

925
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,590
We'll use one of our chances.

926
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,690
[Finally, they start using their chances.]

927
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,130
[They acquired one chance ticket
during the first mission.]

928
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,260
[They acquired two chance tickets
during the second mission.]

929
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,830
[They have three chance tickets.]

930
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,260
Can I pick one?

931
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,230
[Three people can
attach the seeds first.]

932
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,760
[It's great!]

933
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,360
- Let me attach it.
- Me, too!

934
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,090
- Me, too!
- Go ahead.

935
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,930
[The three men in the middle
will shoot out the seed.]

936
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,730
[The chance ticket is really useful.]

937
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:28,090
[From the beginning,
it's Jong Kook's turn.]

938
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,640
[Checks]
[Why look at me?]

939
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,760
Why are you doubting him?

940
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,990
[A perfectionist, Team Ye Ryun's Ace
is on the move!]

941
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,530
[The seed fell.]

942
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,330
Jong Kook!

943
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:56,000
[Trust makes way for treachery.]

944
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,030
[They blew out the chance ticket.]

945
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,160
[They have two tickets left.]
Good riddance!

946
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,240
[Wait and see, Grasshopper...]

947
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,430
Good luck!
[They start the acting.]

948
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,560
Please allow our marriage, Mother.

949
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,220
[Yo Won succeeds at attaching the seed.]

950
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,190
I'll never do that.
[The mother succeeds at it.]

951
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,830
No, I'll never allow it!

952
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,990
They look like a real family!

953
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,030
[Will they be able to turn the table?]

954
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,190
Take off your glasses.

955
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,640
- Where are the seeds?
- Stop swallowing them.

956
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,930
Stop eating it!

957
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,250
[Ready... set...]

958
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,590
[Blow]

959
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,060
[The seed is thrown.]

960
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,760
[I'm good at revenge.]

961
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,760
[Bring it on!]

962
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,160
[Team Ye Ryun's second attempt]

963
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,890
[They use another chance ticket.]

964
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,840
- Let me draw!
- Go ahead!

965
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,230
- This is your second ticket.
- Yes.

966
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,330
- Pick a good one!
- I will.

967
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:15,230
- Show us first.
- Read it loud.

968
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,030
[Dud]

969
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,450
[I'm a dead meat.]

970
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,360
[Mental breakdown]
Show them.

971
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,730
Come over here!

972
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:30,190
[Gloomy forebodings always prove true.]

973
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,860
Nephew!

974
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,990
[The other teams are happy.]

975
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,990
Your chance is blown like that.

976
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,330
[They start the acting.]

977
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,640
Succeeded!

978
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,180
[The second player is Mother.]

979
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,360
[Full of seeds]

980
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,060
She has five on her face!

981
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,390
[Playing jackstones on her face]

982
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:07,560
You do not match her in any way.
[Will Kkuk succeed this time?]

983
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,530
He did it.

984
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:16,700
[The fourth runner, the brother-in-law]
[Succeeded]

985
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,470
[It is my turn?]

986
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,010
[What's he doing?]

987
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,260
What are you doing?
[He puts lots of seed in his mouth]

988
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,390
Don't fail after drawing the dud!

989
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:33,190
[You're talking to a child!]

990
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,730
[Everyone is nervous.]
The world is a tough place!

991
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:41,390
- Gary did it!
- Succeeded!

992
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:46,170
[The only one left is
the child who drew a dud.]

993
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,860
[It landed on his lips.]

994
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,510
[Team Ye Ryun succeeds
at the third stage.]

995
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:01,260
Good job!
[Team Ye Ryun goes for the fourth stage.]

996
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,190
Let's go!

997
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,290
[What's this table for?]

998
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,130
[All kinds of household
items are on the table.]

999
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,830
[What do they need to
act for the fourth stage?]

1000
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,600
After saying the line,
sweep and throw the items.

1001
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,670
[The highlight of the angry scene,
sweep and throw!]

1002
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,730
Pick one member
who will sweep the items.

1003
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,030
And the ones with the basket
need to make the first one angry.

1004
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,160
The first one will throw the items
and the two need to catch 10 items.

1005
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,050
If the acting is good,
we'll reduce the number of the items.

1006
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:50,960
- Please stand  behind the line.
- Try to slide toward us.

1007
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,630
I think you still have feelings for me!

1008
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,090
Why do you act this way?
This isn't like you!

1009
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,360
- This isn't like me?
- Just leave me alone!

1010
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,140
I just think you're ugly!

1011
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,340
[Keep the anger and throw them!]
Let's catch them!

1012
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,420
[Getting them in the face]

1013
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,530
[They caught two items in total.]
It was too strong!

1014
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,130
I can do better.

1015
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,090
[Team Yerin's second attempt.]
Why do you treat me like this?

1016
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,260
[Noisy]
What's going on?

1017
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,770
[Team Ji Hyo passes the third stage.]
Let's go.

1018
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,490
[Nervous]
You're always exercising!

1019
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,670
Get them!

1020
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,060
[They've chased us very close.]

1021
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,190
[This time, we'll succeed!]

1022
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,660
How is it possible to get ten?

1023
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,990
[Team Ji Hyo's chance]
Say something to make him angry.

1024
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:55,630
- Suk Jin, you can do it.
- I can do it.

1025
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,090
But you've done nothing for me.

1026
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:01,290
- You won't be able to do it!
- What did you say?

1027
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,890
- Did you just call my names?
- Hey you!

1028
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,690
Don't call me hey!

1029
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,560
Did you just spit?

1030
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,430
[The angry sweep!]

1031
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,260
- How many do we need to catch?
- Two, four, six...

1032
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,530
We have seven.

1033
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,460
[Team Yo Won arrives at the stage, too.]

1034
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:27,190
[If Team Yo won succeeds at this,
it'll be a great reverse.]

1035
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:32,890
- You just put them into a pile?
- What's wrong with that?

1036
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,500
What kind of house is this?

1037
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,330
Why?
This is how we like it.

1038
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,160
- Just let them.
- That's not going to help.

1039
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,430
[How will it turn out?]
Can I use two hands?

1040
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,560
- You're pathetic!
- What did you say?

1041
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,360
Do you want me to punch you in the face?

1042
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,130
- What did you say?
- Do you want to end this race like this?

1043
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,060
- What did you say?
- It's all your fault!

1044
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:04,960
I did my best,
but you ruined it all!

1045
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,890
[He's got plenty!]

1046
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,490
[Thrown back!]

1047
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,830
It all bounced back.

1048
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,130
- Was the sweep too strong?
- It was.

1049
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,730
[Team Yo Won caught two items.]

1050
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,760
We'll use the chance ticket.

1051
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,360
[They're using the last ticket.]

1052
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,390
Place the line 10 centimeters closer.

1053
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:37,490
- Isn't this good?
- It could be good.

1054
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,330
[The possibility goes up.]

1055
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,190
10 centimeters?

1056
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,030
[Why do they have so little?]

1057
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,590
PD, are these bunch of gift sets?

1058
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,560
- Isn't this too much?
It's not a Christmas stocking!

1059
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,030
They put these
inside the rubber gloves.

1060
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,830
Are you going to let them do it?

1061
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,060
- I see, I understand.
- Take them out.

1062
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,280
I'll give these to you just like this.

1063
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,960
[Team Ye Ryun's third attempt]

1064
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,630
Start acting!

1065
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:12,060
That's all you've got?

1066
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,590
Throw it properly!

1067
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,060
- I'll show you this time!
- Please show us!

1068
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,390
One, two, three!

1069
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,530
[We'll end this now.]

1070
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,030
- You caught the rubber glove!
- It's empty.

1071
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,390
Who took out all the stuff?

1072
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,460
- Four items.
- Who did it?

1073
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,030
- I did it!
- That's great!

1074
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,860
[Kkuk's operation package fails.]

1075
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,860
We'll use our chance ticket.

1076
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,430
- Let's just use it.
- Draw it, Ji Hyo.

1077
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,930
Maybe we'll get 50 centimeters closer.

1078
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,960
We'll use our chance ticket now.

1079
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,760
[Dud]
We can do it.

1080
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,760
Make me angry!

1081
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,830
Kwang Soo, that's all you can do?

1082
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,290
Is that all you've got?

1083
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,160
No, I've heard that too many times.

1084
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,190
Everyone, please swear at me!

1085
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:17,230
[Scream]
We can censor it with the beep sound!

1086
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,130
Get lost!

1087
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,160
Who said 'get lost?'

1088
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,590
You're ugly!

1089
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,430
Get lost and he's ugly.

1090
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,630
I'm ready!

1091
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:32,790
Throw it, you fool!

1092
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,560
You're just a tall...

1093
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,830
Why didn't you tell me?

1094
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,930
- Tell you what?
- One, two, three!

1095
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,890
[Team Ji Hyo fails at it again.]

1096
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,530
[Team Yo Won uses their chance as well.]

1097
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,520
[Though thy beginning was small]

1098
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,790
[yet thy latter end should
greatly increase, hopefully.]

1099
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,860
[Place the line 30 centimeters closer.]

1100
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,690
[Will they be able to reverse the score?]

1101
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:05,960
[Team Yo Won's second attempt]
I think they'll do it.

1102
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,860
Get ready.

1103
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,990
You just ruin everything!

1104
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,930
We've been the last all along!

1105
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:17,460
I think I would've been better by myself!

1106
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,930
- What?
- What is he talking about?

1107
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,960
We won because of me at first!

1108
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,160
Let's just break up
after this game!

1109
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,330
Let's break up!

1110
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,060
We'll reduce two items for your acting.
Catch eight items.

1111
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:32,090
- Eight items?
- One...

1112
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:36,330
two, three!

1113
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,060
[Amazing!]

1114
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,330
[Here you go!]

1115
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:45,940
It's a lot!

1116
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,730
[This looks the best ever.]

1117
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:58,530
One, two, three, four...

1118
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:04,890
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten!

1119
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:10,160
Eleven, twelve... eighteen!

1120
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,390
- We did it!
- We reversed the score!

1121
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:26,040
[Team Yo Won's been always the last.]

1122
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,550
[Right until the third stage,
their team was left alone again.]

1123
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:35,920
[But they've turned the table!]

1124
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,220
[Will they be able to keep
the upturn until the end?]

1125
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,630
Sangam-dong, Mapo-gu...

1126
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,490
- That's where we started today.
- That's right.

1127
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,860
Let's go!

1128
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,130
We've won in the end.

1129
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,190
I thought we would be the last place.

1130
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,590
Ye Rin, did you see
how we played with your mom?

1131
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,460
This is how we are.

1132
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,490
That was great!

1133
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,930
There's traffic.

1134
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,030
It's okay to be in traffic but...

1135
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,790
I need to go to the bathroom.

1136
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:17,360
What have you done to her?

1137
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,990
Why did you make her cry?

1138
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:25,090
Why are you just standing there?
[This won't do.]

1139
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:29,490
<i>If the acting is good, we'll reduce
the number of the items.</i>

1140
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,930
I can't stand it any longer!

1141
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,860
[Oh my god!]

1142
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:46,290
Hit him harder!

1143
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:52,630
[Powerful slap]

1144
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,160
We'll reduce four items.
Just catch six items.

1145
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,190
You need to sweep it slowly.

1146
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,790
Let's not catch at the same spot.
Catch it from the left.

1147
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,660
Ready!

1148
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,840
One, two, three!

1149
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,160
[It's basket full of items.]

1150
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,590
- Great!
- We did it!

1151
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,860
One, two, three...

1152
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,790
four, five, six, seven

1153
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,960
eight, nine, ten, eleven!

1154
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,730
[Team Ye Ryun passes the fourth stage.]

1155
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:37,490
But we didn't really need the acting.

1156
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:41,290
We caught eleven items!

1157
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,430
[Thank you for the citizen's cooperation!]

1158
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:49,290
[Team Ye Ryun heads to the last stage.]

1159
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,730
Prism Tower,
it's the same place from before.

1160
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:56,460
For the ending scene,
is there another game?

1161
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,630
It seems like there's
something at the end.

1162
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,190
[This is a battle of speed.]

1163
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,000
[Which team will arrive
at the final stage first?]

1164
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,090
[The last casting call will be held]

1165
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:14,690
[at the same place where
the production presentation was.]

1166
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:19,760
[Team Yo Won gets there first.]

1167
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,160
Let's run!

1168
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,390
[They're heading to the third floor.]

1169
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,660
What's this?

1170
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,060
[The attack of the
group of desperate fans.]

1171
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,560
[Behind the fans, there are group
of reporters waiting for them!]

1172
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,230
[It feels nice to be welcomed!]

1173
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:48,230
[But they need to get to
the third floor quickly.]

1174
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,370
[While team Yo Won are trapped
in the fans and the reporters...]

1175
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,990
I think we might have to
search for an item.

1176
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:58,490
It's on the third floor, right?

1177
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:03,630
[Team Ye Ryun arrives at the final site!]

1178
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,290
Yo Won, hurry up!

1179
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:10,630
[This is like a mad house!]

1180
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:13,360
[They're approaching to the entrance.]

1181
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,200
Please write the visitor's log.

1182
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,270
[They need to get a permit
to enter the building.]

1183
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,670
[They're almost out of their minds.]

1184
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,880
Please say a word.

1185
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,050
- Please leave a word for fans.
- I love you!

1186
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,880
[They've got the permit.]

1187
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,050
[She still looks elegant like a queen.]

1188
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:41,190
[Team Yo Won enters the building.]

1189
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,560
[Team Ye Ryun gets to the lobby.]

1190
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,060
Are you running?

1191
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,230
[Scream]
What should we do?

1192
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:56,340
[The rush of fans and reporters]

1193
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,910
I love you!

1194
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,980
[Don't get too excited,
We mobilized them.]

1195
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:08,850
I think there's a mission
that we quickly need to do.

1196
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,450
[They arrive at the third floor.]

1197
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,390
Read this script and do the acting.

1198
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,390
Can I go to the bathroom first?

1199
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,500
[In a daze]

1200
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:27,000
We're in a hurry!
Jae Suk!

1201
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,670
Give me a moment.

1202
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:32,210
[While Jae Suk is having
the personal moment...]

1203
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,570
[Team Ye Ryun goes through the lobby.]

1204
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,010
[They get to the information desk.]

1205
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:42,380
Are they here?

1206
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,520
That's enough!

1207
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,550
Hurry up and go!

1208
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,290
What's this?

1209
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,660
[There's a wedding set in the studio.]

1210
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,290
Do what's in the script!

1211
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:57,500
[That's right, the script!]

1212
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,530
One person stand
in the middle of the arch.

1213
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:07,070
After saying the line,
hold a pose like the picture.

1214
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,210
[Huh?]
What's that?

1215
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:17,580
[In the meantime, Team Ye Ryun
is finishing up the permit.]

1216
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,220
- How are you doing, Gary?
- Doing great.

1217
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,620
[Now Team Ye Ryun
is heading to the third floor.]

1218
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,720
[Hurry up
before the other team comes!]

1219
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,930
Let me stand in the middle.

1220
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,060
Take this.

1221
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,200
I think we can win when we do this.

1222
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,830
Hurry up!
[Act the last scene and hold a pose!]

1223
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:43,260
[Will they be able to finish acting
without getting interrupted?]

1224
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,380
The studio on the third floor.

1225
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,480
What would it be?

1226
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,120
[Are we the first team?]

1227
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,590
[Team Ji Hyo joins.]

1228
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,390
What is it?

1229
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:01,630
[He goes out the building.]

1230
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,830
[Please let us love.]

1231
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,000
[The bride and groom
enter the hall quickly.]

1232
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,840
Do you promise to love each other,
so long as you both shall live?

1233
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,810
Yes, I promise!

1234
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:24,280
I now pronounce you, spouses for life.

1235
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,920
[They only need to hold the pose.]

1236
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,090
[Hurry up!]

1237
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,290
Look, there are cameras everywhere.

1238
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,460
It's weird.
There's got to be something.

1239
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,460
What's this?
[Team Ji Hyo is still in puzzlement.]

1240
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,560
[Scream]

1241
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,670
[He shoots out a heart.]

1242
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,560
[The gunfire of fans]

1243
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:56,860
[Don't you forget
we need to do the mission!]

1244
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,230
[Make a star with your hands.]

1245
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,620
[If no one interrupts them...]

1246
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:09,330
[Here we go!]

1247
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,860
Success!

1248
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:22,890
[Ha Ha, Lee Yo Won
and Yoo Jae Suk are cast!]

1249
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,660
We did it!

1250
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,390
We turned around the result!

1251
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,890
[Wait, there's no one here.]

1252
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:31,060
Let's go sit at the top.

1253
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,930
[Before other teams get here...]

1254
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,690
They said do what's in the script.
Hurry up!

1255
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:41,720
[We must be the first team.]

1256
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,060
[Relaxed]

1257
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,660
- Is this correct?
- Success!

1258
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,030
Okay!
Are we done?

1259
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:52,770
We're the winners!

1260
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:58,140
[It's time to finish up.]

1261
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:05,440
Act like we just got here.

1262
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,230
I was lost in the middle!

1263
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:11,360
[Team Ye Ryun is hiding, too.]

1264
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,130
- Isn't this right?
- Success!

1265
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,830
[Team Ji Hyo just got here.]

1266
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:22,460
We're the winners!

1267
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,090
What's going on?

1268
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:30,900
[The winners in illusions march.]

1269
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,560
[What's going on?]

1270
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,230
[What situation is this?]

1271
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:38,190
We're the winners!

1272
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:41,290
[We want to tell them...]

1273
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,760
Therefore, today's winner is...

1274
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,660
Lee Yo Won's team!

1275
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,330
[What's going on?]

1276
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:55,730
[Team Yo Won completes the mission
and the hidden camera!]

1277
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,790
[Please explain to us...]

1278
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,960
[Even the Queen is laughing.]

1279
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,400
I walked out like this.

1280
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,490
We did it twice.

1281
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,230
Yeah!

1282
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:20,480
Ye Rin, your mom won!

1283
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,290
Give them the winning prize.

1284
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:27,290
- What is that?
- Is that an actor's chair?

1285
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,890
This is not a chair for actors.

1286
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:34,330
- Isn't this fishing chair?
- I'm going to keep this name tag.

1287
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:37,430
The name is stitched with golden thread.
[And a golden badge!]

1288
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:41,630
The winning team is the blue team!
