[It's not uncommon to hear
them raise their voices]

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,220
[and they constantly
blame each other.]

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,380
[How can they be so different?]

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,160
[They couldn't trust
each other for five years...]

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,090
[And today!]

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,470
[A telepathic challenge
in an extreme situation!]

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,110
[They blame each other
for their continuous failures.]

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,000
[Will they be able to connect
with each other today?]

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,850
We're very tired now.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,890
[The 24-Hour Observation Experiment:]
[Consensus.]

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,160
["A" studio in
Paju, Gyeonggido.]

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,490
- Hello!
- Hi!

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,890
- Hello, everyone!
- Hello!

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,670
- It's a personal room.
- It's a changing room!

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,800
Good morning!
[There are seven changing rooms]

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,070
Do you know what time it is?
[in the middle of the set.]

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,670
- It's noon.
- It's lunch time.

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,450
- What's this?
- What is it?

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,450
It looks cool.

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,070
Please change into
your team outfits, first.

21
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,220
Go into the room
with your name tag on it.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,330
- And get changed.
- Right now?

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,200
It took us a while to get ready.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,050
Why didn't you just say it before?

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,710
Please get changed.

26
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,090
Can't we stay a little longer?

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,490
- Is it a sponsor?
- Team outfits.

28
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,020
There are two outfits.

29
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,060
Pick one.

30
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,850
Which one do we wear?

31
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,850
- What?
- Do we just pick one?

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,450
Maybe the same colored
outfits are the same teams.

33
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,000
I should have worn a black hat,
I was matching for no reason.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,560
- Just wear it!
- Don't try to match!

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,220
[They even complain
about picking an outfit.]

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,200
[Why are they asking us to choose?]

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Are these the teams?

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,850
[Beige shirts: Ha Ha, Gary, Jong Kook.]

39
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,620
I should have wore a black hat.

40
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,780
[Khaki shirt: Ji Hyo.]

41
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,380
[Beige shirt: Kwang Soo.]

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,620
It's so hot!

43
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,060
[Beige shirt: Jae Suk and Suk Jin.]

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,870
[Ji Hyo's the only with
the khaki shirt on.]

45
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,470
[Am I the only one on my team?]

46
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,020
So what happens now?

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,110
- Are these the teams?
- Now, change back.

48
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,270
Pardon?

49
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,820
<i>Change again.</i>

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,050
<i>Pardon?</i>

51
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,710
We just got changed!

52
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,050
Do we have to match?

53
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,420
Please, change again.

54
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,050
[What's going on?]

55
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,490
I'm not changing!
I already said it.

56
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,960
- What are you saying?
- Who are you saying that to?

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Is he a bully or what?

58
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,780
What are you doing?

59
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,250
I was saying it to you.

60
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,250
[They're fighting again!]

61
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,160
[We need to know
what the mission is]

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,560
[in order to change...]

63
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
What's going on?

64
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,900
- I'm done.
- Do we go out?

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,960
[Jong Kook keeps
his beige shirt on.]

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,270
It's hard changing back and forth.

67
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,690
Just come out, then!

68
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,870
I don't like the khaki color.

69
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,740
But I like Jong Kook even less.

70
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,400
Khaki's better than Jong Kook.

71
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,890
Are we on the same team, then?

72
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,250
- It doesn't work out, anyway.
- It's uneven.

73
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,380
Please change back.

74
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,310
I think we have to change
until we're matching!

75
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,580
Oh, really?

76
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,020
[Is that it?]

77
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll be right here, so go change.

78
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
Wear the color you like.

79
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,450
We're going out.

80
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,450
We're coming out!

81
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,730
[Ha Ha, Jong Kook,
and Gary chose beige.]

82
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,450
- Jae Suk!
- Ji Hyo wore the same thing!

83
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,140
Ji Hyo wore it, too!

84
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,180
Gary and I never matched.

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,090
[How are we so different?]

86
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,360
Go back, and change!

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Please change, again!

88
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,180
Just wear this!

89
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,290
You change!
You never changed!

90
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah, you change!

91
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,820
Listen to me!

92
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,330
You guys are fighting over that?

93
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,420
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and decide.

94
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,490
Okay, let's all play.

95
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,360
But since Ji Hyo's wearing this...

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,690
Just get a rep from
beige and one from khaki.

97
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,960
Why is nothing working out?

98
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,280
- Don't talk.
- Jong Kook doesn't have to be our rep!

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,870
- I'll do it.
- Kwang Soo, you go.

100
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,650
Rock-paper-scissors!

101
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,420
[They decided to match with beige.]

102
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,020
[I have to change again?]

103
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,180
Just go in!
Be cool about it!

104
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,060
- Jae Suk!
- I hate Jong Kook more than khaki!

105
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,270
What if this isn't the mission?

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,650
This is better than Jong Kook!

107
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,650
What if they tell us
to change again?

108
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,650
Then we'll do that.

109
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,380
Let's stop changing,
it's too troublesome!

110
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,310
- This color suits you better.
- Yeah, you look prettier.

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,180
[They're changing
into beige shirts.]

112
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,560
Is there a color decided already?

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Don't talk if you
haven't changed much!

114
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,910
At least I'm wearing this.

115
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,010
We're all wearing this anyway.

116
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,080
I didn't say anything.

117
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,250
[Angry]

118
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't be stubborn!
You have it all the way up your bum!

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,020
[He's so aggressive.]

120
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,860
Now, please go inside.

121
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,830
- Why?
- Maybe we did it right!

122
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,370
We were supposed to match.

123
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,370
[Now, into the unknown place...]

124
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,700
Do we go in?

125
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,330
[We've prepared
a special experiment lab.]

129
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,820
[We are inviting you to
this unfamiliar place.]

[Current time, 11:30 a.m.]
[The seven Running Man members enter.]

131
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,450
What's this?

132
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,050
It's refreshing!

133
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,400
- It's nice!
- What is it?

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,670
It looks like a show home.

135
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,110
Wow, it's so nice!

136
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,070
[It's an open and refreshing area.]

137
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,980
- There's "Ponpoko."
- It's my favorite!

138
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,600
I love it!

139
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Wow, it's like an arcade!

140
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,220
[Confused]

141
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,930
I love this!

142
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,580
[A modern and simple interior
that captures their attention.]

143
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,620
[A special place that is made]

144
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,670
[just for the seven
Running Man members.]

145
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,820
There's a hammock!

146
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
It's an open space!

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,930
There are so many toys!

148
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,800
All the props that we've ever
used are all here.

149
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,180
- There's ping pong.
- Eraser!

150
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,890
There's a ping pong paddle.

151
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,580
This kind of place is my dream!

152
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,870
[Giraffe found his dream house.]

153
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,440
[They have so much to play with.]

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,310
There's an eraser.

155
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,180
I will hit your bum!

156
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,250
[Are we allowed to keep playing?]

157
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,820
What are we doing?

158
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,150
This is so nice!

159
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,620
It's so refreshing.

160
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,520
I want to live somewhere,
like this.

161
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,990
But it would be really cool
to live somewhere similar.

162
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,130
It would be nice.

163
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,430
I would want like
a gym installed here.

164
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,160
[They're slowing letting]

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,170
[their guard down.]

166
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,700
It would be so nice to have a gym!

167
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,670
Half-gym, half-house.

168
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,170
And bring friends, too.

169
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,910
- It would be cool to have a gym.
- Like the gyms in the U.S.A.

170
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,780
Don't talk about the U.S.A!

171
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
[They don't know
what is yet to come...]

172
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,380
Is it "The Battle for The Strongest"?

173
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,050
That scared me!

174
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,000
[The alarm went off all of a sudden.]

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,460
[What's going on?]

176
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,460
[24 hour, unanimous race.]

177
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,270
- "Unanimous"?
- What's a 24 hour unanimous race?

178
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,560
[24 hour unanimous race?]

179
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,870
So that's why they made us
wear matching shirts.

180
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,470
We need to be unanimous?

181
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,710
- 24 hours?
- Oh, my god.

182
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,310
[We're staying for 24 hours?]

183
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,740
[If all members are unanimous
within 24 hours, you'll succeed!]

184
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,890
You'll succeed if
you are unanimous.

185
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,330
So that's why!

186
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,890
We need to be unanimous.

187
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,160
If we are, then we leave?

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
Oh, we need to complete
three unanimous missions.

189
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,870
Don't they know
we're never unanimous?

190
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,270
We're never unanimous!

191
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,360
We're so different!

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,580
We're never unanimous!

193
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,530
[If you fail, you must
leave after 24 hours!]

194
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,400
- After 24 hours...
- Oh my god.

195
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,690
[We have to leave after 24 hours?]

196
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,580
[Dumbfounded]

197
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,930
- Really?
- So, tomorrow morning?

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,290
[The 24-hour imprisonment starts now...]

199
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,330
Let's get it right!

200
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,450
We know each other.

201
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,290
- We know each other.
- I think we could do it.

202
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,180
We can be unanimous.

203
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,470
Almost all of us matched at the
beginning, with our clothes.

204
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,510
More than that,
we know each other's preferences.

205
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,130
But we could be wrong by guessing
each other's preferences.

206
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,560
We just need to choose either
Jong Kook's or Jae Suk's preference.

207
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,130
[They have to pick between
the polar opposites.]

208
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,560
We might be wrong,
trying to guess preferences.

209
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,510
What's happening?

210
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,960
[The countdown starts now!]

211
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,760
We're supposed to feed ourselves?

212
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Really?

213
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,380
You see the
white acrylic box, right?

214
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,600
Please put all your
cellular devices inside.

215
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,100
Why our phones?

216
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,650
[They're not allowing any kind of
communication from the outside.]

217
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,440
It's not easy.

218
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,980
[They're stuck in
an unfamiliar place.]

219
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,440
Let's be unanimous!

220
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,760
[They need to know
each other's preferences.]

221
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,290
[They always blame each other!]

222
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,730
[For five years, there were
conflicts and betrayals.]

223
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,750
[An impossible mission
aimed at a consensus.]

224
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,760
[Everything depends on them.]

225
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,400
[Will they be able to succeed
in being unanimous?]

226
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,830
We can tell our managers to go out.

227
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,600
They probably already are.

228
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,370
I wish you would get along, today.

229
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's show them we're family.

230
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,940
Let's show them!

231
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Let's do it!

232
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,110
[What's their first mission?]

233
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,850
[First unanimity challenge.]

234
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,720
[Random box]

235
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,690
What is a random box?

236
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,290
Random box?

237
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,560
[All members need to
pick the same colored ball]

238
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,300
[in order to succeed.]

239
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,900
[Only three chances are given.]

240
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,700
[Discordance]

241
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,510
[Unanimous]

242
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,980
- We only have three chances.
- How is this going to work?

243
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,910
How do we do this?

244
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,910
This won't work!

245
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,820
But it sounds fun.

246
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,250
It's so intense.

247
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,150
My heart is fluttering.

248
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,690
There aren't any penalties?

249
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,720
It's going to be fun!

250
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,290
There are only
two balls in this box.

251
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,460
[There is a red and a blue ball.]

252
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,730
What if we're lucky

253
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,500
and we get it right all three times
and just go home?

254
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,440
You can turn air, like
"Animal Kingdom" or something.

255
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,740
Or we can play
"eliminate the staff's name tags."

256
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,640
You figure it out, on your own.

257
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm nervous.

258
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,780
[First try at Random Box.]

259
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,250
You have three tries.

260
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,920
What if we get it right?

261
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,790
Round one!

262
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,020
- There are two!
- There are two balls!

263
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,760
[Nervous]

264
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,730
[Red ball or blue ball,
that is the question.]

265
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,330
[Five years worth of
teamwork and friendship.]

266
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,370
[Will all seven members
connect telepathically?]

267
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,560
[Did they connect...]

268
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,050
Round one!

269
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,550
[And the results?]

270
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,850
I'm going crazy!

271
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,560
[Blue ball: Jae Suk, Ha Ha,
Ji Hyo, Gary.]

272
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,200
[Red ball: Suk Jin,
Kwang Soo, Jong Kook.]

273
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,230
[They failed their first try!]

274
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,220
This is hard to match.

275
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,110
It's red, blue, red,
blue, red, blue.

276
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,330
Isn't this pretty good?

277
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,810
This was just a warm up.
This is how good we are.

278
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,250
So, there's two rounds left?

279
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,050
Please put it back in.

280
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,980
But Jong Kook and
Jae Suk are different.

281
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,910
[He's not letting go of the ball.]

282
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,110
Exchange boxes.
Take your hands out.

283
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,890
You're so smart.

284
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,490
I approve!

285
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,600
You're so smart!

286
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,050
We lost.

287
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,310
They've prepared a lot.

288
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,650
He knows what we're like.

289
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,690
Round two!

290
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,370
[You can see, right?]

291
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,780
[Which ball I'm holding?]

292
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,050
Ready, set!

293
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,090
What if we're right?

294
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,650
[They failed the second try.]

295
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,620
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
are holding blue balls.]

296
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,090
[Kwang Soo, I only have you...]

297
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,310
The five of you
got it right, though!

298
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,760
That's so interesting.

299
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,510
We only have one try left.

300
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,490
We got three right
the first time, and then five.

301
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,710
Please, please!

302
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,110
Round three!

303
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,180
What color should we pick?

304
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,250
- What about blue?
- Blue?

305
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,690
Are we going with blue?

306
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,910
[Then I'll need to get blue as well...]

307
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,220
Ready, set!

308
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,820
I got it!

309
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,890
Let's go!

310
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,720
[Last try at Random Box.]

311
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,930
[If they fail this, they have to
wait until the next mission.]

312
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,730
[Will they get it on their last try?]

313
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,420
[They failed their first mission,
Random Box.]

314
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,070
[Blue ball: Gary, Ji Hyo,
Ha Ha, Jong Kook.]

315
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,810
[Red ball: Kwang Soo,
Jae Suk, Suk Jin.]

316
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,620
[The unlucky three.]

317
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,020
What's going on?

318
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,070
[Oh my god.]

319
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,830
[The punishers are here!]

320
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,510
[The incredible red devils]

321
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,620
[is charging!]

322
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,730
[Their first gift
is a water gun shower.]

323
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,180
[We will punish you for
not succeeding the mission!]

324
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,650
[They're so happy with
the shower service.]

325
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,090
[When did he hide here?]

326
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,620
We're sorry!

327
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,710
[They're restlessly shooting
their water guns.]

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,510
We're all wet!

329
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey, Hwan Jin!

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,980
It's Hwan Jin!
Hwan Jin!

331
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,420
[We'll see you at the next mission.]

332
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,110
Who kept shooting
at my underwear?

333
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,110
Honestly!

334
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,730
Someone shot in my ear!

335
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,400
This is insane!

336
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,880
- Oh my god.
- Hwan Jin!

337
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,180
- Gary, why are you so clean?
- I was hiding here.

338
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,490
This is also luck.

339
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,920
Why aren't you wet?

340
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,620
They shoot really aggressively.

341
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,730
It's so cold!

342
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,800
Turn the AC off!

343
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,130
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

344
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,270
[They're complaining about
the punishers.]

345
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,850
The next mission is in an hour!

346
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,140
An hour later?

347
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,870
[The next mission
will be in an hour.]

348
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,250
We have to do something for an hour,
so we're not bored.

349
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,070
- We need to do something.
- You're so cruel.

350
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,320
[Mental breakdown]

351
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,960
Next time Jong Kook,
you take it and shoot them.

352
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I should.

353
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,620
I didn't think they
would shoot for so long.

354
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,670
I remember all of your faces!

355
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,730
Hwan Jin is the leader.

356
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,600
I thought he was a ninja turtle!

357
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,530
[Ji Hyo... sorry for

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,610
A heart should be posed like this!

540
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,810
I'll do that from now on!

541
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,140
Don't use the other way, ever again.

542
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,250
Oh my god!
You're just picking on me!

543
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,550
- You got selfie wrong!
- Go reflect on your actions.

544
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,490
We are.

545
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,650
[Please forgive us.]

546
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,990
Do we rest, now?

547
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,420
You have 51 minutes
until your next mission.

548
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,790
What do we do now?

549
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,060
We go back to what we were doing.

550
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,700
Order food for us.

551
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,400
No, but seriously.

552
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,300
[While Gary gets
ready for his puzzle]

553
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,180
Gary's totally into it!

554
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,620
I'm going to play ping pong.

555
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,670
Let's play doubles!
[They get ready for a badminton match.]

556
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,560
[They're using the divider as a net.]

557
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,670
[They're hosting
a badminton rally.]

558
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,220
Let's have a punishment!

559
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,490
How about slapping the forehead?

560
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,560
- Slapping the forehead.
- Okay!

561
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,200
- How many points?
- 15 points.

562
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
It'll be quick.

563
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,650
[Game, start!]

564
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,530
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha vs.
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo.]

565
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,420
Suk Jin!
Suk Jin!

566
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,360
[With Jae Suk's mistake,
they lost a point.]

567
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
It's okay.

568
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,210
[Jae Suk's error, once again.]

569
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,740
[Don't worry,
it's only the beginning!]

570
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,350
Okay, ready?

571
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,050
Go!

572
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,120
I couldn't see it.

573
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,960
Eight versus five!

574
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,330
12 versus 10!

575
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm going crazy!

576
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,830
[Time's passing by quickly.]

577
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,870
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha 13
vs. Suk Jin and Kwang Soo 12.]

578
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,410
That's good!
Yeah!

579
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,410
Smash!

580
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,310
[Grasshopper's smash.]

581
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,780
- Out!
- In!

582
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,950
[It is now 14 vs. 13.]

583
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,850
This one is match point.

584
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,820
[We will slap your foreheads.]

585
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,980
Stubborn badminton.

586
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,180
Everyone just wants
to hit it hard.

587
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,400
Suk Jin!

588
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,870
[Just then, the shuttlecock
flies behind Suk Jin!]

589
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,440
[Nice receive!]

590
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,020
[Jae Suk's smash.]

591
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,620
It's over!

592
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,080
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha won the match.]

593
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,670
- It's over!
- It hit the floor, then the wall.

594
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,670
- Please offer us your foreheads.
- Kneel down.

595
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,620
[Their punishment
continues right away.]

596
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,670
[They're glued to the puzzle.]

597
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,670
Just crouch.

598
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,450
Since this is a punishment...

599
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,200
Obviously, I know but...

600
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,510
- Just be reasonable.
- Don't worry.

601
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,130
It'll finish in less than a second.
It'll start here and finish there.

602
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,470
Ready!

603
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,270
This is my first time.

604
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,960
[Forehead smash
like a bolt of lightning.]

605
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,130
From the right to the left.

606
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,790
From right to left.

607
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,850
[Please go easy on me!]

608
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,110
I told you, from right to left.

609
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,890
Wow, that woke me up.

610
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,420
Please get up.

611
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,530
[They're focused on their puzzle despite
what's happening around them.]

612
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,050
This is simple.
That's good.

613
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,780
- Water?
- You never mentioned this!

614
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,490
This sticks well.

615
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,490
It'll hit well.

616
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,110
It'll finish quickly.
Would you like a smash?

617
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,930
It's because of the water.

618
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,090
[Please go easy...]

619
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,820
It's because of the water.

620
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,330
The sound is louder with water.

621
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,580
[Dizzy, dizzy]

622
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,530
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

623
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,500
[I can't let it go.]

624
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Let's do it again!

625
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,970
[Giraffe is still in shock.]

626
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,110
This is only the beginning.

627
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,280
Rock-paper-scissors isn't fun.

628
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,810
Let's play a game.

629
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,780
My ears were ringing
when I got hit.

630
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,080
[Big Nose is getting something.]

631
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,190
The sound is just loud.

632
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,190
Kwang Soo!

633
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,520
Are you confident with jegichagi?
(similar to hacky sack)

634
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
Should we play foot
volleyball with that?

635
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't change the subject!

636
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,630
You're so funny.

637
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,630
- You two come here.
- Let's do something!

638
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,630
Let's do something!

639
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,040
Let's slap foreheads again,
with this.

640
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,370
It's not fun if it's too frequent.

641
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,010
I don't like things
getting personal.

642
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,680
I hate personal things.

643
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,050
I hate it the most.

644
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,450
People who get emotional
when they play games...

645
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,550
Let's just play it once!

646
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,220
[He's trying to make a deal
by touching him.]

647
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,130
Just this once!

648
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,730
[They're unbelievable.]

649
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,330
Let's just play this for once!

650
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,930
Listen to Suk Jin!

651
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,000
He's asking for it this badly!

652
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,740
I'm talking to you!

653
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,610
Let's just play this!

654
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,540
Let's play catch!

655
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,380
- Maybe you can use the pot.
- Why don't you listen to me?

656
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,180
[Overheating]

657
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,550
Wouldn't it be fun?

658
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,960
It'll fall between legs.
Sounds fun, right?

659
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,560
Imagine it will fall in between legs!

660
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,820
Look at them.

661
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,050
They don't care what we do.

662
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,530
Just use the pot.

663
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,310
- Don't we need to order something?
- Yes, we're hungry.

664
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,180
[We're confined,
but let us eat at least...]

665
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,220
[Thanks to Easy Brothers,
they've failed the game of Yut mission.]

666
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,380
Isn't this tasty?

667
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,420
[They ordered spicy seafood noodle soup
and sweet and sour pork unanimously.]

668
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,710
Even if I don't have my cell phone,
it's not too bad when we're together.

669
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,190
Since we don't look at the our phones,
we get to see each other's faces.

670
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,830
Maybe, this race is for that purpose.

671
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,700
You can tell each
other's personalities.

672
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,130
I can't stand still
doing nothing.

673
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,200
Me, too.

674
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,000
Do you think we can escape today?

675
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,570
We haven't succeeded at all, right?

676
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,080
If only I was able to make a heart...

677
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,150
The selfie was very close, too.

678
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,050
Yes, but heart was worse.

679
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,160
The two "Infinite Challenge" members
ruined it for the rest of us.

680
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,850
What are you talking about?

681
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,980
The two members of "Infinite Challenge"
made a mistake on Running Man.

682
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,910
It's not like you did very well today.

683
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,660
While you played the game of Yut.

684
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,200
That was your fault!

685
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,530
[All of a sudden,
it's Kwang Soo's fault.]

686
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,670
You flipped it.

687
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,890
I did?

688
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,180
When you play the game of Yut,
you only have two choices.

689
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,800
- That was my fault?
- Whatever that is, it's your fault.

690
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,360
Unlucky people like us
can't play games of luck.

691
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
You should go to a house of prayer
or get an exorcism.

692
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,750
I can't believe how unlucky they are.

693
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,510
Maybe you need to hire a shaman.

694
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,000
By the way, it's very delicious.

695
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,490
[The finishes eating while bickering.]

696
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,000
This is very nice meal.

697
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,820
[He finishes the spicy
seafood noodle.]

698
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,650
[The time left until the escape]

699
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,210
[The time flies while they
failed a few missions and ate.]

700
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,640
Maybe we're too relaxed.

701
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,480
- We only have seven minutes left.
- Seven minutes?

702
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,580
- We did a good job at killing time.
- Since we ate.

703
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,950
I started to like this place.

704
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,450
- That's true.
- This place is nice.

705
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,690
You should try to escape!

706
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,730
We're going to give you missions that
you can reduce an hour from now on.

707
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,660
We have many kinds of missions.

708
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,300
One of them is Pop-up Pirate
as we've always played it.

709
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,650
It's over there.

710
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,310
Since there are seven people

711
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:24,580
we'll reduce one hour, if it
doesn't pop up for two rounds.

712
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,940
There are many people
that make it pop at once!

713
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,810
[Mission impossible]
That's really difficult!

714
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,810
How is it possible to make it last?

715
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,120
It's ready!
[Pop-up Pirate starts!]

716
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,580
For two rounds...

717
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,550
- It's scary.
- Please, start the game.

718
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,120
Do you want to go first, Kwang Soo?

719
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,650
I'll do it first.

720
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,360
[Trying to stay on the safe side.]

721
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,570
[Even though we fail at it,
I don't want to be the one...]

722
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,670
[How is it even possible?]

723
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,110
Seriously!

724
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,110
Kwang Soo!

725
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,540
[The god of misfortune]

726
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,380
What just happened?

727
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,680
Is it possible?

728
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,450
What's wrong with you?

729
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,020
Wow...
You're worthy of respect.

730
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,200
[They fail to get a chance.]
He's truly cack-handed.

731
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,160
[The worst cack-handed man]

732
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,260
How am I going to live
the rest of my life?

733
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,900
[They're all standing up now.]

734
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
[They're standing up for the mission.]

735
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,340
[What will the next mission be?]

736
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,520
[Unanimous strike]

737
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,460
When the timer hits zero,
everyone throws a ball.

738
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,800
You'll succeed if you bowl a strike.

739
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,330
That's bowling!

740
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,930
You'll carry out this mission outside.

741
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,230
It's been a while!

742
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,730
It's like "Old Boy"!

743
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,070
They made a bowling alley.

744
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,440
It's bowling!

745
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,690
[A giant bowling alley]
It's incredible!

746
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,110
Running Man is the best!

747
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,820
[Will they be able to reach unanimity
at this huge bowling alley?]

748
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,220
They're here again.

749
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,090
- Gap Jin!
- It's water gun again.

750
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,690
Just push it straight.

751
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,960
I'll be in the middle.
I'm good at bowling.

752
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,430
Stand in the middle, Suk Jin.

753
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,270
Should I stand in the middle?

754
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,270
When Suk Jin says he's good at
something, he's usually not good.

755
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,530
- His pose isn't that good.
- I have experience.

756
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,110
Look, Gap Jin is aiming for you.

757
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,010
[Aren't you hot, Jong Kook?]

758
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,550
Earlier, you shot a lot of water.

759
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,050
Let's steal their water gun
if we succeed at it.

760
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,960
Get ready!

761
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,000
We need to make it straight
toward the pins.

762
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,820
- Let's start walking from three.
- Three, two, one.

763
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,160
That's too fast.
Walk slowly.

764
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,990
Jong Kook and Suk Jin
should hit it fast.

765
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,230
This is a good chance!

766
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,330
[Now is the chance!]

767
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,600
<i>Gary!</i>

768
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,300
[The members have proven
their bowling skills in the past.]

769
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,070
[They have a chance of success
if they time it right.]

770
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,280
Get ready!
[Challenge to win Unanimous Strike]

771
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,510
- Fight!
- Fight!

772
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,810
We need to roll it at zero.

773
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,380
Someone should read the timer.

774
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,960
- Fight!
- Fight!

775
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,400
[The countdown starts!]

776
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,290
Three, two, one!

777
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,450
[Everyone should think
the same and bowl.]

778
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,200
[This is the chance!]

779
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,090
One, throw!
[They throw at the same time.]

780
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,620
[Kkuk and Suk Jin throws it hard,
and the the rest throws it weak.]

781
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,720
[The bowling balls should not
crash into each other.]

782
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,990
[Please, please, please...
get a strike!]

783
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:17,170
It looks good!

784
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,140
[Will they knock down all the pins?]

785
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,780
[Hit, hit, hit]
Good, good!

786
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,380
[There's only one pin left!]

787
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,680
[Please!]

788
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,950
We did it!

789
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,360
[Strike!]

790
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,090
[They've reached their
first unanimity.]

[The Consensus Race]

792
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:04,050
[They've completed one out of three.]

793
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,390
[Laughing at the punishers.]

794
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,890
We almost failed.

795
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,490
Who threw the last ball?

796
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,220
Me, me, me!

797
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,760
[Gary's ball hit the last pin.]

798
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,470
Out of three chances
you've completed one.

799
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,510
[They have two more to go.]

800
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,890
[They re-enter proudly
after their first success.]

801
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,210
[What are we going to do
until the next mission?]

802
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,780
If we put another divider.
We can play foot volleyball.

803
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,450
I thought it was possible,
and we actually did it.

804
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,790
We can do it unless
we need to win by luck.

805
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,990
We're good at many things.

806
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,990
We could've done two
if it wasn't for this.

807
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,470
[Are they already giving
out another mission?]

808
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,340
What is it?

809
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,490
[Is it something different
than other missions?]

810
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,510
A coin falls into the fish tank!

811
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,910
All seven members should put
a coin in the dish inside a fish tank.

812
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,000
We can practice for an hour.

813
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,070
- For an hour?
- We can start practicing now.

814
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,180
Oh, in that fish tank?

815
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,290
- It looks easy.
- That's a big tank.

816
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,890
They told us to practice
for an hour, it must be hard.

817
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,450
- Don't you think so?
- We just need to throw it, don't we?

818
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,850
Is that difficult?

819
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,300
[Jae Suk tries throwing a coin.]

820
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,450
You need to control your power.

821
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,510
[A coin moves around because
of the resistance of the water.]

822
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,180
[The stronger they throw,
the more resistant the water gets.]

823
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,270
[It's simple but difficult.]

824
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,790
[Everyone has a different
method of tossing it.]

825
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,110
- It's too difficult.
- This is the game that's by luck.

826
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,800
[The goddess of fortune,
Blank Ji attempts.]

827
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,290
She's good at everything.
[She's lucky Blank Ji, indeed!]

828
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,110
What did I just do?

829
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,220
Why is she good at this?
[Will all seven of them be successful?]

830
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,850
[The conclusion is that
they need to practice.]

831
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,960
We shouldn't push the coin.

832
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,620
I can't do it at all.

833
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,870
Your coin is not even close, Suk Jin.

834
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,090
This upsets me.

835
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,130
Wouldn't it be possible
to see the flow of the water?

836
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,930
I did it!

837
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,760
[He made it.]

838
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,400
[Okay!
I've got the hang of it.]

839
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,670
It's in the right direction now.

840
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,100
- Look!
- You figured it out.

841
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,490
Who did it?

842
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,070
It's not always the same, but...

843
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,780
from here...
[Yoo Jae Suk's coin technique school]

844

[I admire you, Jae Suk!]
Please teach me.

845
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,290
Don't try putting it there.

846
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,850
[Let me try, give me the coin.]

847
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,850
You know how to do it.

848
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,020
Let me try it once.

849
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,580
Suk Jin, can I try it once?

850
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,190
[He can't hear it.]
Let Gary practice, too.

851
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,100
[Talking isn't going to work.]

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,640
[I need to practice, too...]

853
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,850
[Gary succeeded, too.]
Jae Suk's method is the best.

854
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,250
Isn't that the best?

855
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,800
- Can we put five at once?
- No!

[He refuses so fast.]

857
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,930
You could've consider it.

858
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,670
Because that doesn't even make sense.

859
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,250
[I'm sorry, my answer is no.]

860
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,450
Do you just say no to
whatever Kwang Soo say?

861
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,070

I can say I'm good at it confidently.

865

- How many times did you do it?
- I think I did about 30 times.

he stops him.

You don't have to do it in a hurry.

You can have five coins each.

Start with the those
who are good at it.

877
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,360
Jae Suk should start first.

If one person fails,
that's the end of it.

Should I go first, then?

880
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,400
Someone who can do it should start.

- I need to put one out of five, right?

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,940
I'm happy as if I won
a gold medal at the Olympics.

888
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,560
[The second runner, Kwang Soo]

889
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,870
When we have a good luck,
we need to quickly do it.

890
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,560
Oh, I see.

891
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,280
[He realizes his mistake
quickly after he fails.]

892
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,790
[They're already having a crisis.]

893
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,930
Can I take a break?

894
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,820
Take a break.

895
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,580
Don't bend your wrist,
just release it from straight up.

896
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,700
Relax your hand as much as possible.

897
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,310
[He fails three times out of five.]
Take a break!

898
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,690
Just take a break for
two weeks from the show.

899
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,490
[You need an exorcism...]

900
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,980
How can you be so unlucky?

901
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,640
You've already failed three times.
[Kwang Soo takes a break]

902
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,250
[and the Coin Master
Jae Suk challenges.]

903
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,820
He's the best among us.

904
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,910
[His second attempt]

905
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,070
[It was close.]
It's okay.

906
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,910
What good is it doing it well
only when you practice?

907
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,890
Do it well.

908
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,940
You should get it this time.

909
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,530
He made it!

910
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,530
Next!

911
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,670
[Gary and Jae Suk]

912
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,600
You need to do it close.

913
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,780
- It doesn't matter
- if you practiced it or not.

914
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,950
He practiced the least.

915
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,150
He enjoyed his free time.
[Fail]

916
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,760
Do it slowly.
Don't miss your chances like that.

917
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,190
- Jae Suk seized the chance.
- I'm doing my best.

918
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,110
He's such a trouble maker.

919
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,630
The water is shaking.

920
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,600
Why did you cover the camera?

921
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,300
Don't put your hand in the water.

922
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,540
What do I do?

923
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,910
- Just do it.
- He doesn't know the basics.

924
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,810
- Ah!
- Just move aside.

925
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,780
Wasn't that pretty close?

926
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,990
[Jong Kook's first attempt]

927
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,960
It's so difficult.
[It was close...]

928
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,380
I think it'll be difficult
to give out the coins.

929
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,830
[Jong Kook attempts right away.]

930
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,260
[Gary, Jae Suk and Jong Kook
succeeded.]

931
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,690
Pushing is okay, too.

932
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,360
[Ha Ha fails at his first attempt.]

933
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,940
I think he will do it this time.

934
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,670
[He almost succeeded
at the second attempt.]

935
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,710
I can feel it now.
I'll do it this time.

936
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,360
Just do it boldly!
Don't be nervous.

937
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,220
[Goal in!]

938
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,790
Okay, okay!

939
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,120
We can do it.
One coin left?

940
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,330
I think it's better when
it falls straight.

941
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,530
Don't make it bend.

942
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,290
It's too close.

943
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,070
Did it get in?
Wow!

944
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,960
Do it properly!

945
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,250
[Now, only Kwang Soo
and Ji Hyo are left.]

946
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,290
I'll do it first.

947
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,760
She did it earlier.

948
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,020
[Her first attempt out of five.]

949
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,090
[She got lucky during the practice.]

950
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,560
[Will she be lucky for the real game?]

951
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,960
[Succeeded at once!]

952
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,250
[Gary, Jae Suk, Jong Kook,
Ha Ha, Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo]

953
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,020
[So much pressure!]
Why did you!

954
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,690
Good job, Ji Hyo!
[She's lucky Blank Ji!]

955
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,640
We didn't expect that.

956
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,450
[The only left is
the Variable Kwang Soo.]

957
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,490
[It's all in Kwang Soo's hand.]

958
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,720
[How did I get here again?]

959
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,360
[His misfortune continued
for the past five years.]

960
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,940
[His misfortune wasn't only his.]

961
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,600
[He always ends up at the point
where they decide for victory.]

962
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,940
[Many times, he lost the chance
of winning for his team.]

963
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:12,410
[Even today, he blew up
their chance with his misfortune.]

964
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,380
[He doesn't want to affect
the fate of the team any more.]

965
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,050
[But, he's doing it again.]

966
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,560
[He has only two coins.]
Wait for him.

967
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,670
[Will he be able to]

968
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:35,530
[break the chain of misfortune
and save the team this time?]

969
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,240
[A perfect success!]

970
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,610
[The miracle of the Variable!]

971
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,620
[Their second consensus!]

972
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,120
[What a nail-biter!]

973
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:04,070
[The Consensus Race]

974
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,960
[They've completed two out of three.]

975
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,020
Let's play foot volleyball.

976
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,360
- Let's bet a forehead slap.
- I like it!

977
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,850
We need chairs.
[They want to kill the time.]

978
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,800
I brought chairs.
Let's tie the net around the chairs.

979
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,850
- Let me see.
- We can tape it.

980
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,910
[They're making their
own foot volleyball net.]

981
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,910
[If they applied themselves
to studying this much]

982
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,210
[they could've gone to Harvard.]

983
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,380
Gary put a lot of pieces.

984
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,130
Don't you want to finish the puzzle?

985
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,600
[For seven hours, he's found out
the true meaning of jigsaw puzzles.]

986
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,450
[A foot volleyball court is completed.]

987
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,930
This is for the forehead slap.

988
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,690
Of course.

989
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,690
[Wait and see...]

990
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,290
[You insulted my forehead.]

991
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:02,020
[I think my forehead will hurt
when it rains.]

992
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,980
[Vengeance is mine.]

993
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:10,360
[They treasure the puzzle
and move it to a shelter.]

994
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,400
[Carefully]
Ji Hyo, sit over here.

995
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,730
[Monday Couple's first joint asset,
the jigsaw puzzle]

996
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,060
They treat it like their child.

[Three on three]
[The forehead cup foot volleyball]

998

999
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,600
[Kkuk joins Grasshopper and Ha Ha.]

1000
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,110
Win a forehead slap!

1001
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,600
Let's play service game.

1002
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,000
Let's decide who's going to serve.

1003
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,270
Rock-paper-scissors!
I lost.

1004
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,940
We'll just play service game.

1005
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,110
Play fair!

1006
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,280
[Grasshopper's team
vs. Big Nose's team]

1007
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,550
We're doing all sorts of things today.

1008
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,160
Take it, Kwang Soo!

1009
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,870
- Nice!
- Out!

1010
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,760
You said it's going
to be a service game.

1011
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,980
[We won the serve by
playing rock-paper-scissors...]

1012
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,380
You said we'll play a service game!

1013
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,110
[They must hate to be slapped
on their forehead badly.]

1014
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,110
No one scored, then.

1015
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,670
[They restart the game.]
Out!

1016
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,510
- In!
- It was on the line.

1017
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,410
- Good!
- Head, head!

1018
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,020
I told you head the ball!

1019
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,850
One to zero!

1020
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,000
- How much should we score?
- 15.

1021
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,910
[Don't forget,
your skull is on the line!]

1022
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,870
It's one to zero.
[Big Nose's team's serve.]

1023
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,270
Again!
We have two chances to serve.

1024
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,570
You're supposed to have two chances.

1025
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,670
[Big Nose's second serve.]

1026
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,970
Look carefully, Ha Ha.

1027

- The ball come toward you.
- What are you going to do?

1028
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,280
- My, my, my!
- Your, you!

1029
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,680
[Don't touch the ball!]

1030
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,890
[Finally, it's a golden chance!]

[With the pain on his forehead...]

1032
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,910
[take that!]

1033

- Oh, damn it.
- Fail!

One to one!

1037

[I've been assembling
it for seven hours]

1043

[with Ji Hyo...]
[We put so much effort.]

1044
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,730
They've doing it for the whole day.

1045
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,760
He's having a mental breakdown.

[Hard work is actually wasted.]

1047
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,940
Gary and Ji Hyo built it
for the whole day.

1048
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,930
I'm going to win this.

1049
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,580
Let's stop joking and
play it seriously.

1050
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,180
- Two to one.
- I'm going to receive it.

1051
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,070
You need to receive the serve.

1052
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,450
I'm good at it.

1053
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,020
I passed it like that.

1054
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,510
Out!

1055
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,130

Spike...

1059
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,130
[A belly button trapping?]

1060
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,130
Why?

1061
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,330
[And he's talking about spike?]

1062
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,870
Four to one!

1063
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,420
- It's four to one!
- They're so bad.

1064
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,880
[Again!]

1065
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,150
Get the ball!

1066
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,820
He received it.

1067
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,940
[Wobble]

1068
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,220
[Splayed apart]

1069
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,670
- I'm sorry, Garry.
- This is frustrating.

1070
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,980
Gary, I'll do better.

1071
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,360
Why am I playing on this team?

1072
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,820
- He's wrecked.
- Five to one!

1073
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,530
[Grasshopper: Big Nose]
[5:1]

1074
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,540
In!

1075
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,110
The best play should've been
positioned over there!

1076
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,510
It's out!

1077
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,690
[Grasshopper: Big Nose]
[8:4]

1078
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,690
My!

1079
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,090
Kwang Soo!

1080
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,090
Good!

1081
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,270
It's a little too high, Kwang Soo.

1082
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,050
Kwang Soo!

1083
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,860
[Slip]
[Fall]

1084
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,200
[Bowling Pin Brothers]

1085
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,650
[They fell in sync.]

1086
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,250
It's worth the photogenic award.

1087
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,900
They fell as if they were bowling pins.

1088
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,410
Match point!
[9: 4]

1089
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,560
Let's just get slapped.

1090
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,090
[He hit the ball with his face.]

1091
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:48,090
It's over.

1092
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,090
- Suk Jin!
- It's supposed to be over.

1093
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,130
Because he hit the ball twice.

1094
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,930
The umpire doesn't say anything.

1095
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,140
But why keep passing
the ball to Kwang Soo?

1096
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,010
[Gary flies]

1097
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,540
[10: 4]
We won!

1098
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,180
I'm sorry, Garry.
It's my fault!

1099
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,980
[Total wreck]

1100
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,610
Why do I belong this team?

1101
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,380
Gary has no reason to join that team.

1102
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,520
[It's time for the slap?]

1103
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,780
Time to get beat up.

1104
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,290
Take a seat.

1105
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,590
We have a very inflexible player.

1106
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:26,760
- I want to get slapped by him.
- No, Jae Suk will slap me.

1107
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
We'll pick.

1108
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,400
We'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1109
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,130
Rock-paper-scissors!

1110
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,230
Nice shot!
I want Jae Suk!

1111
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,640
[Giraffe picked Jae Suk first.]

1112
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,440
Yeah!
Ha Ha!

1113
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,010
[Gary picked Ha Ha.]

1114
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,510
He's going to slap you quietly.
It won't even be funny.

1115
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,410
We'll start slapping.

1116
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,180
We have two minutes left.

1117
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,090
It's not a flick but a slap?

1118
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,390
Ready?

1119
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,660
- You know I helped you to win...
- I'll count.

1120
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,660
One!
[Slap!]

1121
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,600
[High five!]

1122
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,700
Good night!

1123
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,540
[Hair-raising]

1124
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,710
It's Gary's turn.

1125
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,710
I should have picked Jong Kook.

1126
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,080
Wait a minute.

1127
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,250
Ready?

1128
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,750
- Dong Hun, think about our friendship.
- I won't hit you hard.

1129
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,550
Our friendship...

1130
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,650
think about it.
[Slap]

1131
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,860
[Take the friendship!]

1132
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,830
[It sounded like a wooden mallet.]

1133
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,360
I didn't hit you hard.

1134
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,630
That wasn't so bad.

1135
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,770
You're lucky.

1136
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,640
[Big Nose is extremely nervous.]

1137
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,910
Did you pee, Gary?

1138
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,340
Gary's crying.

1139
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,250
I'm not crying because it hurts.

1140
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,480
I'm crying because I'm upset.

1141
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,080
It's Suk Jin's turn.

1142
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,390
- My eyes hurt.
- I might die!

1143
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,420
Gary's crying!

1144
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,590
I'm going to hit you like this.

1145
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,390
Time's up!

1146
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,690
[Is Big Nose saved by the bell?]

1147
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,660
- No, no.
- Time is up.

1148
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,530
I'll hit like this.

1149
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,370
I'll just touch it like this.
It won't be hard.

1150
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,530
Let's do it now.
Please count for me.

1151
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,370
One, two!

1152
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,310
That was too weak!

1153
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,110
He's too kind.

1154
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,350
- He didn't want to hurt him.
- It hurts so much!

1155
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,220
Ha Ha's slap was...

1156
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,120
- What's the mission?
- "Her hair's rear-ly beautiful."

1157
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:44,060
Wear a wig in the changing room,
and come out.

1158
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,890
I think there will be two wigs.

1159
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,330
VJs can go out first.

1160
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,000
A long wig and a short wig...

1161
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,130
Pick the shortest wig.

1162
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,300
The shortest.

1163
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,900
[We'll pick the shortest wig
and go home for sure!]

1164
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,870
- Please stand in front of your name.
- Yes.

1165
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,540
I'll count to three.

1166
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,380
Wear a wig inside, and come out.

1167
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,050
We can get out
if we succeed at it.

1168
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,220
You need to come out
at the same time.

1169
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,890
This is a variety show.

1170
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,260
We can go home
if we wear the same wig.

1171
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,230
- You only have one chance.
- Just once?

1172
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,960
You can go in now.

1173
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,130
- We have only chance.
- I can't open it.

1174
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,530
This drives me crazy.

1175
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,000
This is confusing.

1176
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,010
[There are five wigs inside.]

1177
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,080
[Will they be able to reach a consensus?]

1178
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,280
[Which one is the shortest
or funniest?]

1179
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,250
- This is...
- confusing!

1180
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,720
- It's confusing.
- I told you.

1181
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,960
[It should be the shortest.]
This is the only one.

1182
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,990
[It's for the variety show, right?]

1183
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,900
[What will be the result?]

1184
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,670
- Wait a moment!
- Three

1185
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,530

afro hairstyle appears.]

[Blank Ji with helmet-like
hair appears.]

1195
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,660
[They fail to reach unanimity.]

1196
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:37,170
[Their trick fails.]
This is a variety show!

1197
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,270
I told you to get the shortest one.

1198
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,470
[What will be the
punishment this time?]

1199
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,450
- What are they doing?
- Only one!

1200
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,450
Only one!

1201
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,550
I don't know what it is but, Jong Kook!

1202
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,690
Jong Kook!

1203
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:55,820
I think they're saying only
one will be punished.

1204
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,290
Go fight against them.

1205
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,920
One person?
Why did you push me?

1206
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,260
You can win.

1207
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,180
You're the best game player among us.

1208
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,760
Wait, I think there's an
oriental medical doctor.

1209
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,800
Do I have to get an acupressure
or acupuncture treatment?

1210
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,340
[Bingo!]
Only one!

1211
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,700

00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,540
Did you decide?

1215
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,110
It's going to be Suk Jin.

1216
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,380
[All of a sudden, they pick Suk Jin.]

1217
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,550
[Thank you for choosing me.]
You're not very healthy.

1218
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,350
I can't feel any
strength from his slap.

1219
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,720
Please lie down on your side.

1220

- Yes.

[Can he really give
him a punishment?]

1222
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,090
He looks familiar.

1223
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,630
I have lower back pain.

1224
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,200
You should be careful.

1225
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Tell me if it hurts.

1226
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,170
- Ahhh!
- Is that hurt?

1227
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,870
Dang...

[Back, legs... and dang?]

1229
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,140
Doctor, are you kidding me?

[Embarrassed]
What are you doing?

1232
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,920
It's acupressure!
Why did you push him?

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,720
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

1234
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,520
What's this?
Is it acupressure?

1235
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,790
Can I switch with someone?

1236
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,990
[Curious Giraffe comes
forward for the punishment.]

1237
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,530
- Pelvis...
- I've never gotten a massage for pelvis.

1238
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,660
You're getting it today.

1239
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,730
[Big Nose is a crybaby,
it can't be that painful...]

1240
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,010
[A touch from the hell.]

1241
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,440
He's very persistent, too.

1242
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,240
[Go away!]

1243
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,080
Is it really that hurt?

1244
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,180
He can't move.

1245
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,810
Get up.
[Stiff out of shock]

1246
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,680
We're filming right now.
Don't act like this.

1247
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,120
Why are his hands stiff?

1248
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,580
Doctor...

1249
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,000
- Is it that hurt?
- Do you want to try?

1250
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,710
Try it, it's a good pain.

1251
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,260
I also want to try pelvis massage.

1252
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,430
It's really good.

1253
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,800
- I know it really hurts.
- I'm not joking!

1254
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,250
[Grasshopper takes on
the punishment.]

1255
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,000
[Wobble]

1256
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,010
Wait!

1257
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,510
This is...

1258
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,740
<i>Don't make a sad face like that.</i>

1259
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,930
<i>I won't give you up.</i>

1260
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:16,120
Wow, Jae Suk almost cursed!

1261
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,930
[Scream]

1262
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,560
[Satisfied]
I wonder how hurt it is.

1263
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,470
Try Jong Kook.

1264
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,020
I've receive the treatment many times.

1265
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,270
- Long time ago.
- Still, you should try.

1266
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,400
I think you have a problem
with your hip joint.

1267
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,540
You're right.
I do.

1268
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,940
[He's good.]

1269
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,110
Which side should I lie on?

1270
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,670
This leg is a bit shorter.

1271
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,670
- Don't let him move.
- Wait!

1272
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,670
[I can't do this.]

1273
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,330
You need to hold him down.

1274
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,120
[They captures Tiger.]

1275
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:54,420
[Tiger keeps crying while
they're trying to cure him.]

1276
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,510
[Cry]

1277
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:58,070
[Bite]

1278
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,400
[Tiger shares his pain with Giraffe.]

1279
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,910
[Long live, Tiger Kkuk!]

1280
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,400
[It's Ha Ha's turn.]

1281
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,510
You little!

1282
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,960
Oh, no, mister!

1283
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,070
This is insane!

1284
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:19,180
[Ha Ha's pelvis is blessed.]

1285
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,910
Gary's turn.

1286
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,730
[Gary also screams out of joy.]

1287
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,560
Stop, stop it!

1288
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,030
That's too deep!

1289
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,800
[What a bold touch!]
Wait!

1290
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,020
Let's give him a round of applause.

1291
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,400
[Thank you so much for
the healthy punishment.]

1292
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,450
[We will never forget your touch...]

1293
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,160
[Currently, they've reached
two consensuses.]

1294
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,950
[If they keep failing,
they can go home in 15 hours.]

1295
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,650
We're getting tired now.

1296
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:02,530
Do you want to bet for some snacks?

1297
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,730
Snacks and beverages.

1298
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,360
- What do you want to bet?
- Give us some water.

1299
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,500
Let's bet for an hour.

1300
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,300
- For an hour?
- No, Haroro.

1301
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,530
Let's not do that.

1302
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,170
- Only 10 minutes left for the next.
- Let's eat some snacks.

1303
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,870
Just buy some on the way home.

1304
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,910
You guys are so stiff!

1305
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:22,670
If you didn't put your left hand up,
we could've gone home.

1306
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,450
Mister, you made a tiny finger heart!

1307
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,850
Get out, both of you!

1308
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:30,420
- Who came out with a wrong wig?
- Ji Hyo and...

1309
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,580
- It was Suk Jin.
- Five of you were wrong!

1310
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,790
[Shifting a viewpoint!]

1311
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,890
[Cheeky]
Then what about me?

1312
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:43,430
Then, all six of you
made a wrong heart.

1313
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,870
I want to eat something like...

1314
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,170
- Choco Pie.
- Gummy bears.

1315
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,900
I want some ice cream.

1316
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,250
- Some water.
- Shaved ice with red bean!

1317
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,510
I was going to say it.

1318
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,290
- Don't lie.
- I'm serious.

1319
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,910
[They talk like someone
who just started their army service.]

1320
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:01,510
- I'll eat that when I'm done.
- Don't leap into a fire pit.

1321
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,200
[We really want to get out...]

1322
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,090
Four, three, two, one!

1323
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,960
[It's the mission time.]
What is it?

1324
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,130
[It's back again!]

1325
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,360
[What will the mission be?]

1326
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,970
From now on, you can
go out for an hour.

1327
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,970
Go out for an hour?

1328
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,740
[What's this all about?]

1329
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,440
We can go out for an hour?

1330
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,040
[We'll announce an
enormous benefit after an hour.]

1331
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,980
[Pick your cell phone and allowance.]
Seriously?

1332
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,350
We can go out?

1333
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,580
What is it?

1334
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,890
- I don't want to leave.
- You're giving us allowance?

1335
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:39,950
I feel lazy to go out.

1336
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,520
We can really go out?

1337
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,220
- For sure?
- Go out?

1338
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,660
Can we eat with this money?

1339
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,230
We can go out and eat.
Why did you suggest to bet?

1340
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,660
I told you to be patient!

1341
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,060
That's right!

1342
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,530
We even have allowance!

1343
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,900
[They almost bet for an hour.]

1344
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,700
We can get out and buy
something with this money!

1345
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,570
You don't have a hunch!

1346
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,240
They gave us a lot of money.

1347
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,240
Why?
Why do they tell us to go out?

1348
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,410
I don't know.
Is there a spy here?

1349
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,720
We can go anywhere?

1350
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,000
The situation is somewhat similar
to that nap for an hour.

1351
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,630
They're not going to make
someone as spy, are they?

1352
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,460
Well, it's good to be outside.

1353
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,070
I feel relieved.

1354
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,740
- The air is fresh.
- It's good to breath in fresh air.

1355
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,400
How long has it been?

1356
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,540
Let's get going!
Where should we go?

1357
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,110
- Should we all go together?
- Where are we going?

1358
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:40,950
Where do they want us to go?

1359
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,310
- Let's go.
- Suk Jin, where are you heading now?

1360
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,250
I don't know.
Do you want to go with me?

1361
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,220
Is it really okay to
leave only with VJs?

1362
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,520
Can we go together?

1363
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,360
[Monday Couple is already together.]

1364
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,620
Let's go replenish our sugar, Gary.

1365
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,620
Gary, I think...

1366
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,780
we might get a mission
when we're get back together.

1367
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,800
There's got to be a mission,
but why do they want us to go out?

1368
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,740
Maybe there's a spy...

1369
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,810
[I have no idea.]

1370
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
It's suspicious.

1371
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,950
[200 percent uneasy]

1372
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:21,620
Maybe the mission is
to get there by 8 p.m.

1373
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,290
Why did they give us the cell phone?

1374
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,430
[Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Big Nose
and Giraffe are going together.]

1375
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,400
Why did they let us
out for an hour?

1376
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,820
But this is a mission.

1377
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,270
Yes, it's a mission.
What time is it?

1378
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,270
We need to go back by 8 p.m.

1379
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,370
Maybe we need to
get back by 8 o'clock sharp.

1380
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,810
I don't know...

1381
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,710
I feel uncomfortable.
[Haroro joins Monday Couple.]

1382
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,950
They told us to pick these up.

1383
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,150
They even gave us our phones.

1384
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,390
There's something about it.

1385
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,620
Maybe we can go home right away.

1386
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,090
Maybe only some of us have to stay

1387
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,700
and the rest can go home.

1388
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,830
Could it be possible?
I don't know what it's about.

1389
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,600
Let's just get off.

1390
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,440
They have seafood soup
and fish roe soup.

1391
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,470
Abalone sashimi
and octopus ramen?

1392
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,220
- Wow, octopus ramen sounds good!
- I need to lose weight.

1393
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,550
Let's order one octopus ramen

1394
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,980
Octopus and pork served with kimchi!

1395
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,980
That's awesome!

1396
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,150
I haven't had tofu and kimchi.

1397
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,930
What's this mission about?

1398
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,420
[They feel anxious while
they wait for their dinner.]

1399
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,690
We're not going to
have a spy today, are we?

1400
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,700
Let's eat quickly and
get back by eight.

1401
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,330
Maybe they just want us to have dinner.

1402
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:53,100
- Thank you.
- Hello!

1403
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,710
Let's have small octopus bibimbap.

1404
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,650
[They ordered small octopus dish
when the other group ordered octopus]

1405
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,050
What is this about?

1406
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,670
All of a sudden, they
told us to go out.

1407
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,520
What is this?

1408
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,220
I was happy to be out,
but now it's uncomfortable.

1409
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,620
Should I buy some snacks
at a convenience store?

1410
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,460
- Weren't you going to call Ji Hyo?
- Why do you keep trying to get snacks?

1411
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,430
[He's avoiding eye contact.]

1412
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,300
Does he need to do something?
Maybe he has an individual mission.

1413
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,970
Maybe he does.

1414
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,740
Don't be so sensitive.

1415
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,010
We were making high fives a minute ago.

1416
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,980
I'm very sure it's you!

1417
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,710
[Absurd]

1418
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,550
Jae Suk, say something.
You always keep quiet.

1419
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,190
- I'm so tired.
- Are you together?

1420
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,760
Oh, you two are the spies?

1421
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,560
I see, these two are a team.

1422
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,990
[Their distrust is growing.]

1423
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:52,460
- In the morning...
- These two are...

1424
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,400
It's coming!

1425
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,740
[Time to enjoy octopus
and pork served with kimchi.]

1426
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,770
Thank you.

1427
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,670
Thank you.
[Look delicious]

1428
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,880
Wow, we can have all these.
It's amazing.

1429
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:10,810
[You can forget about the mission
at a time like this.]

1430
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,480
Mmm.

1431
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,150
We picked a good dish!

1432
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:21,060
I hope it turns out
just as you expected.

1433
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,960
Only if we can go home straight...

1434
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,460
Isn't that right?

1435
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,100
[Slurp]

1436
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:33,270
[They're enjoying the octopus ramen.]

1437
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,040
What time is it?

1438
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,810
- Should we leave?
- Let's get there and wait outside.

1439
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,980
- I'd like to pay.
- It was delicious!

1440
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:44,710
Thank you for the food.
[They decided to go back.]

1441
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,750
[Jae Suk's
group is still eating.]

1442
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,780
Maybe they gave us time to eat.

1443
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,050
No, they're giving some
time for Kwang Soo.

1444
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,590
[Oh, no...]

1445
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,060
- Isn't that strange?
- It's getting really uncomfortable.

1446
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,100
Let's just separate.
I'll eat with Kwang Soo.

1447
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,430
Why?
Do you need to discuss something?

1448
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,780
He's driving me crazy.

1449
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,870
"They're giving us time to eat?"
Isn't that strange?

1450
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,570
He's suspicious.
They give us time to just eat?

1451
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,880
It's strange, isn't it?

1452
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,510
It is, but...

1453
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,210
Anyway, we need to leave.

1454
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,550
Let's go back.

1455
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,580
Let's go!

1456
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,780
[15 minutes before 8 p.m.]
What is it?

1457
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,590
Well, I guess they let us go out.

1458
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:32,930
Wait a minute!

1459
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,230
- What?
- Do you know how to go back?

1460
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,730
- Suk Jin!
- Did you figure out something?

1461
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:41,430
- What?
- Isn't this unanimity?

1462
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,340
[Isn't this unanimity?]

1463
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,140
Huh?
Are we supposed to eat together?

1464
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,940
No, I mean...
what did the mission say?

1465
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,550
<i>[From now on, you can
go out for an hour.]</i>

1466
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,150
<i>[We'll announce an
enormous benefit after an hour.]</i>

1467
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,480
<i>We can do anything we want?</i>

1468
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,590
[They said they will announce a
benefit, but not to come back.]

1469
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,390
Do we need to go back all at once?

1470
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,330
- That's it.
- That's not it!

1471
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,900
We don't have to go back.
All of us!

1472
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,800
All together, we can choose
not to go back.

1473
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,670
- That makes sense.
- Doesn't it?

1474
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,800
- Because it's unanimity?
- Yes.

1475
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,800
If we just go home, then that's it!

1476
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,840
We can go home?

1477
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,640
It doesn't matter whether
we go back to the place or go home.

1478
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,610
Don't you think so?

1479
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,380
Should I tell them not to go back?

1480
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,280
They told us to come back.

1481
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,220
But we're the one
who can decide.

1482
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:34,550
[Monday Couple and Haroro are back.]
We're back before eight.

1483
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:39,620
We're here by eight.

1484
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,860
You have 11 minutes left.

1485
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,930
Give us some chocolate.

1486
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,170
Snacks and chocolate?

1487
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,900
For an hour?

1488
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,040
Let's do that!

1489
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,840
[What are you talking about?]
It's fine, no one else is here.

1490
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,440
[We didn't have time to buy snacks.]

1491
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,080
You want to eat, too!

1492
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,540
Gary, Ha Ha's being stupid!

1493
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,010
Let's do that!
You'll lose, if you don't throw

1494
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,080
rock-paper-scissors!

1495
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,350
[Betting can make you and
people around you unhappy.]

1496
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,160
I'm going to go out and buy it.

1497
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,110
- We have 11 minutes, right?
- 10 minutes.

1498
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,060
[10 minutes before 8 o'clock.]

1499
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,930
We just need to reach to unanimity.
Then we'll success.

1500
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,420
Call them.

1501
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,000
No one should be inside.

1502
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,830
- Then we'll fail.
- Call them.

1503
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:26,240
Wow, all of a sudden...

1504
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,840
that idea hits my head.

1505
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,610
- Then, why don't we just go back?
- I think we should all go back.

1506
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,180
No, we don't have to go back.

1507
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,310
- What next?
- We'll go home and that's it.

1508
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,610
Or stay outside.

1509
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:38,080
We're on our way.

1510
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,850
Only 3 minutes
and 46 seconds left.

1511
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:42,850
3 minutes and 46 seconds?

1512
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:46,420
No, we don't have to go back!

1513
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,710
Tell them to stay out of the building.

1514
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,930
Just tell them to get out.

1515
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,090
3 minutes and 40 seconds left.
Hurry up!

1516
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,300
It's not that.
We've talked about the mission.

1517
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,200
It's no use if you
talked about it alone!

1518
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,370
The staffs are all sitting here!

1519
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:02,970
- We need to go.
- Since it's unanimity, either...

1520
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,370
- going back or not...
- You have a time limit!

1521
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,480
Only 3 minutes and 12 seconds left!

1522
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,810
I went the wrong way...

1523
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,750
You got lost?
You...

1524
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,880
I almost cursed.

1525
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,520
What we're saying is, this is
the unanimity race...

1526
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,590
- together, we can choose not to go back.
- We can!

1527
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:20,870
And we'll still complete
the mission successfully.

1528
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,020
No, the clock is running

1529
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,330
and everyone is looking
at the clock here.

1530
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,560
Because the staff are all acting.

1531
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,630
Do whatever you want!
We'll do what we want!

1532
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,230
Don't come!

1533
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,840
If we can't get there on time,
you should leave the building!

1534
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,140
- Just go!
- Tell them to come out.

1535
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,690
Because I don't think
I can make it on time.

1536
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,180
Let's just stand by the door.

1537
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,950
1 minute and 43 seconds...

1538
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,680
- 42 seconds.
- Anyway, let's join them.

1539
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,850
- Wait, wait!
- You need to make another U-turn?

1540
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:56,260
This drives me nuts!

1541
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,430
Where are we?

1542
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,360
[What's keeping them?]

1543
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,970
[Should we go out of the building?]

1544
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,500
We're late.
Are they waiting outside?

1545
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,510
If they're outside, we've succeeded.

1546
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,740
Park the car right here.

1547
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,280
[Did Grasshopper guess right?]

1548
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:26,790
[Hurry up, we don't have much time!]

1549
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:32,220
[Either they're all outside waiting]

1550
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,560
[or arrive on time.]

1551
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,430
[The mysterious mission,
what will be the result?]

1552
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,910
[They ended up getting in.]

1553
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,100
You all came back and didn't go home?

1554
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,270
[What did you say?]

1555
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,840
We could have gone home.

1556
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,410
[They were three minutes late.]

1557
01:13:56,410 --> 01:14:01,220
[For those who are late,
get the punishment!]

1558
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,670
[You came back again?]

1559
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:08,090
[What is it this time?]

1560
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:13,030
[We'll make you stylish
by tying up your hair.]

1561
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,400
[Scream]

1562
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,230
What's this?

1563
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,900
[You act like children,
we'll give you a topknot.]

1564
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,670
(Hairstyle for married man
since Three Kingdoms period.)

1565
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,620
[It's time for the
punishers to go back.]

1566
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,110
I guess we could have gone home.

1567
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,540
See?
I said we could go home.

1568
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,710
But Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
kept saying we need to come back.

1569
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,250
It feels weird to go home
just like that.

1570
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,680
What are you talking about?

1571
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,720
Why do you care about the slate?

1572
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,790
I kept saying that we could go home.

1573
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:40,790
But they kept saying
we need to come back.

1574
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,960
Ha Ha mentioned that earlier.

1575
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,960
What if we all arrived before eight?

1576
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,780
Then, that could have
been a unanimous success, too.

1577
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,650
That's more like a complete success.

1578
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:55,270
If you didn't come
back and all went home

1579
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,940
I was going to announce
your success by phone.

1580
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,470
Anyway, you've failed the mission.

1581
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,610
[Look at her!]

1582
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,580
[Scruffy haired woman]

1583
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,880
You look like a sinner
from a historic drama.

1584
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,220
You should have told us
if you didn't know the way.

1585
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,650
Try not to drive in case of emergency.

1586
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,060
He was lost when he tried
to find my house.

1587
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,260
We were late, too.

1588
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,530
I don't do that on purpose.

1589
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,160
That's suspicious.

1590
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,300
- Now that I think about it...
- No!

1591
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:27,500
- All the long, he was...
- Really?

1592
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,940
Didn't I tell you to go home or not?

1593
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,640
You told us but you brought us here.

1594
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,040
You said it...

1595
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,810
But it was a little weird
to just go home.

1596
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,780
Wait a minute.

1597
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,050
Do we still have 14 hours left?

1598
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:44,120
- When is it going to end?
- Let's get some rest.

1599
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,120
Take some rest.

1600
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,490
We still can't go home.

1601
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,690
What is it?

1602
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,930
We have another mission.

1603
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,230
[One versus six]

1604
01:15:58,230 --> 01:15:59,630
One versus six?

1605
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,070
Does it mean one person can leave?

1606
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,600
One, choose a rep.

1607
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,310
Two, the chosen rep. will wear
headphones and turn around.

1608
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,270
Jae Suk!

1609
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,680
I'll do it.

1610
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,480
Jae Suk is suspicious.

1611
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,250
He's a spy.
Why would you choose the spy?

1612
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,410
I'm not a spy!

1613
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,220
- Are you sure?
- I'm not!

1614
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,020
I hope he's not a spy.

1615
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,690
Let's see how he does.

1616
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:22,520
They doubt me so much.

1617
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,420
[Falsely accused]

1618
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,530
[He follows the command
and wears the headphones.]

1619
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,530
[Next command appears.]

1620
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:37,300
Pick a number for the rep and
he will jump to match the number.

1621
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:41,370
[The rest of the members should pick a
number that Jae Suk is able to jump.]

1622
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:47,210
<i>He gets excited whenever
he listens to the music.</i>

1623
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,950
[Jae Suk's having fun.]
[They're having a meeting.]

1624
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,680
Jae Suk wouldn't
just try to do a lot.

1625
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,650
We can't really guess
how many he can jump.

1626
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,990
When he hears the word "number",
he'll think about it.

1627
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,720
If he doesn't...

1628
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,790
I can only think he's a spy.

1629
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:05,060
If he jumps as much as
he can, then he's a spy.

1630
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:08,030
I think seven is a good number,
let's choose that.

1631
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:11,430
We've decided.
[They chose number seven.]

1632
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:16,160
[If Jae Suk can jump rope seven times,
they'll reach to unanimity.]

1633
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,040
Please take off his headphones.

1634
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:22,160
[Confused]
What is it about?

1635
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,820
Take this.

1636
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,950
[The fate of the members
depends on the jump rope.]

1637
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:31,690
[They explain the mission to Jae Suk.]

1638
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,530
A number that the
members could've picked?

1639
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:36,830
We won't say anything.

1640
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:40,130
We're going to get ready
to give you a hug.

1641
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,560
Because we're a family.

1642
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,170
We can go home, if you get it right.

1643
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,870
Well, we're one.

1644
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,940
[We're "one."]

1645
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,820
I don't think it's a very small number.

1646
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,710
[Why did you say "one"?]

1647
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,450
[Oops, my mistake...]

1648
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,680
How can I guess this?

1649
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,520
We've been together for five years.

1650
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,490
[What's wrong with him?]

1651
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,420
Don't say stuff like that!

1652
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,390
- I mean he can guess right.
- What are you talking about?

1653
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:13,630
- Don't say any numbers.
- I don't know if it's right.

1654
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,500
Please, please!

1655
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,430
I'm going crazy!

1656
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,240
You can do it!

1657
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,440
I should do it so I can
clear myself of a false charge.

1658
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,910
I think you know what it is!

1659
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,040
[So many things depends on one string.]

1660
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,610
<i>A heart!</i>

1661
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,610
[He made a tiny finger heart once]

1662
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:35,050
[then everyone doubted him
for everything he said.]

1663
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,980
I'm going to send
a message via telepathy.

1664
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,990
Let's just send him the message!

1665
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:48,030
[If he succeed at it, we can go home!]

1666
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:54,600
[Did you pick the number?]

1667
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:01,140
[With all the pressure, Yoo Jae Suk
takes an action!]

1668
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,140
[One!
Please don't stop it here!]

1669
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,640
One

1670
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,380
two, three

1671
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,720
[He didn't stop, that's a relief!]

1672
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,850
One, two, three, four

1673
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,400
[Please...]

1674
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,090
[Don't stop at five!]

1675
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,490
<i>We've been together
for five years.</i>

1676
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:23,780
Three, four

1677
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,560
five, six

1678
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,310
five, six

1679
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,420
[Before the slogan of "one"]

1680
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,160
[before "five years"]

1681
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,020
[we were still too different
to come to a consensus.]

1682
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:45,220
[But we were able to be
united around Jae Suk.]

1683
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:56,310
[The members have chosen "seven."]

1684
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:02,960
[Will he really stop at seven?]

1685
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,730
<i>five, six</i>

1686
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,870
seven!

1687
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:11,780
[At the moment of choice]

1688
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,980
[he stopped!]

1689
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,960
<i>five, six, seven!</i>

1690
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,530
[Right after jumping for seven times]

1691
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,730
Wow!

1692
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,870
[They've reached to
the final consensus!]

1693
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,420
[They became one without
saying a word!]

1694
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,380
We're a family!

1695
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:48,980
"We're a family!"

1696
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:57,050
[Summer, 2010. The seven members
met for the first time.]

1697
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:08,270
[They bicker at times,
but they feel like they're a family.]

1698
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,200
[The laugh and the sweat
they have shared together]

1699
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:17,970
[The memory of the past five years
have passed just like that.]

1700
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:23,200
[The seven members were
connected like a miracle.]

1701
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,910
[We're proud of you, Yoo Jae Suk!]

1702
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,690
All of a sudden, I was
chocked up with emotions.

1703
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,290
I was touched!

1704
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:40,000
[Teary]

1705
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,330
This is way better than
going home earlier.

1706
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,030
You're right.

1707
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,270
[An unexpected fulfillment!]

1708
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:49,070
- I had no idea what number it could be.
- Ji Hyo's crying.

1709
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,470
I feel so weird.

1710
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,710
Wow, this is amazing.

1711
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:57,160
I could tell you were going to stop
when you jumped the seventh time.

1712
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,550
I wasn't so sure.

1713
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:01,850
Do you see?
The finger heart came out naturally.

1714
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,920
I love you, Jae Suk!

1715
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,760
You're supposed to do this for a heart.

1716
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,560
Make a finger heart, Jong Kook.

1717
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,230
I don't want to.

1718
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,830
Jong Kook!

1719
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,160
Why should I do that?

1720
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,870
Just make it once!

1721
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:21,000
He's cute.

1722
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,070
That's a cute heart.

1723
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,840
Wow, 13 hours left!

1724
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,310
[With their teamwork,
they've done it in 10 hours.]

1725
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,410
We completed the
race after 10 hours.

1726
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,180
With three consensuses

1727
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,910

1728
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,150
Let's go home!

1729
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,490
[We can go home!]
Yeah!

1730
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,820
We can leave.

1731
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,960
The staffs look so happy, too.

1732
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,330
[You can tell?]

1733
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,500
We're going to get going, then!

1734
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:53,470
Thank you for your hard work!

1735
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,870
