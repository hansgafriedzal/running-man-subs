[Weather Weather]

181
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,250
<i>Because of the world's diversity, all kinds
of weather are occurring at the same time.]</i>

182
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,970
- Again?
- I can picture it already.

183
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,140
I can picture it.

184
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,500
It means there's also summer.

185
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,790
Why is it always like this
when I come?

186
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,060
<i>The last mission is this...</i>

187
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,970
<i>An enormous disaster will occur
because of the unusual weather.</i>

188
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,820
<i>There is only one place that has
normal weather.</i>

189
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,380
<i>Everyone's mission will be to
find the safest place</i>

190
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,600
<i>through the hints you will gain
throughout the day.</i>

191
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,340
Jong Kook keeps sighing really loudly.

192
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,030
No, I'm not.

193
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm going to rest today.

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm going to be relaxed today.

195
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,690
This team stepped on poop in the
first episode of the year.

196
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,290
This is the first day.
What are they going to do?

197
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,440
It could've been worse.

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,310
They don't like being with each other.

199
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,440
[Break through the unusual weather
and find the safest location. Start!]

200

[Break through the unusual weather
and find the safest location. Start!]

201
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,230
[As soon as they come outside,
the cold greets them.]

202
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,910
It was always cold when
you came out.

203
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,750
It was always cold and there
was always water.

204
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
It can't be...

205
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,760
We won't go inside water in
this weather, right?

206
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,830
Red.

207
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,080
[They move to the next mission
place in teams.]

208
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,380
[Kiddo Ha Ha with manners.]

209
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,520
The heater...

210
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,420
[Still a little amazed]

211
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,760
Chae Won was worried about
filming Running Man.

212
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,840
Why?

213
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,550
Since filming a variety show makes
her feel awkward.

214
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,300
It's been a while.

215
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,700
We need to be nice to her.

216
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,680
They'll be good to her, right?

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,340
- Of course.
- The red car seemed to be in high spirits.

218
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,240
Gary and Ha Ha are experts at
assisting actresses.

219
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,750
Really?

220
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,690
They are experts at tending to
the needs of actresses.

221
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,030
They are really good at that.

222
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm being very truthful.

223
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,920
Jeon Ji Hyun and Moon Chae Won
are the best.

224
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,890
Looks are important.

225
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,340
They are very beautiful.

226
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,120
They are.

227
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,730
Can you send me a heart?

228
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,680
Send it through the camera.

229
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,540
Squid!

230
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,540
[Happy Chae Won and the two squids.]

231
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,700
[The landscape continues to become
more suspicious.]

232
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,470
In noir movies they get dragged
to these places.

233
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,360
That's exactly what it is.

234
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,030
This isn't a place we would go to voluntarily.
We get dragged to these kinds of places.

235
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,340
Even the air is cold.

236
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,160
[Arrived at the first mission site.]

237
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,950
Whenever Seung Gi comes
he always has a hard time.

238
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,690
What did we do last time he was here?

239
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,150
We did some flying thing.

240
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,640
I remember.

241
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,610
[Early winter water gun attack]

242
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,390
[Flying chair mission]

243
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,890
[He did the flying chair mission twice.]

244
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,750
[The icon guest of hardships, Lee Seung Gi.]

245
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,090
- What's worse is that I am afraid of heights.
- This is what I like.

246
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,060
Having a fear of heights.
This is what I really like.

247
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,200
This is the best situation for
variety shows.

248
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,390
There needs to be things like this.

249
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,400
If they aren't scared when they
go up to high places then...

250
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,190
Ha Ha!

251
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,800
Do I also have a name tag on my back?

252
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, you do.

253
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,660
Chae Won, what's wrong?

254
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,810
Did something happen?

255
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,760
Chae Won is really funny.

256
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,390
She has a very cute charm.

257
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,220
Kwang Soo keeps on wondering whether
or not he was close to you?

258
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,960
I personally thought we
were like family.

259
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,270
- Can you stop bothering her?
- Bothering?

260
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,540
Actresses don't want to come out
because of you.

261
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,750
[No...]

262
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,450
When Kwang Soo sends you a text,
is it long or short?

263
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,800
It's short. He sends 'kekekeke' a lot.

264
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,340
He sends me long texts.

265
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,620
What are we going to do about him?

266
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,970
You are hopeless.

267
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,340
Should we call Wang Ji Hye
one more time?

268
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,930
- Should we call her?
- I told you that it wasn't true.

269
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,040
Who is it?

270
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,880
Is it Chae Won?

271
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,400
There was a reason for everything.

272
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,490
Why are we walking so far?

273
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,250
How did they find this place?

274
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,650
What is this?

275
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,340
The place is too noir.

276
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,430
[An empty piece of land]

277
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,860
[with an unidentifiable container
and puddle.]

Why does this only happen
when I come?

280

What is this?

281
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,520
[Also what is this thing supposed to be?]

282
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,540
Why does this only happen
when I come?

283
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,130
[More than panic. Cries.]

284
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,280
[What is the first mission of 2015?]

285
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,700
Look at Chae Won's expression.

286
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,670
Look at Seung Gi.

287
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,480
Seung Gi, this only happens
when you come!

288
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
Chae Won can't believe
this is happening.

289
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,050
[Putting on their variety war shoes.]

290
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,700
[Chae Won puts on the variety show
war shoes for the first time.]

291
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,290
No, wait.

292
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,440
They're both for the left foot.

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,620
This is size 280. Do you want it?

294
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,610
[No thank you.]

295
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,980
[Blank Ji puts it on with ease.]

296
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,770
Nobody is taking care of Ji Hyo.

297
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,210
Ji Hyo can take care of herself.

298
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,360
It's fine!

299
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,540
Why can't you let me do this for you?

300
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,710
[Boards the unidentifiable container.]

301
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,100
[Her legs give out because of
the new atmosphere.]

302
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,780
Chae Won is still in her own bubble.

303
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,050
She needs a lot of help.

304

305

00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,330
<i>so the bedrock suddenly changed form.</i>

307
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,050
<i>That is why the people took shelter
in the container.</i>

308

[Mommy...]

Why are you doing this to us?

313

[They instinctively moved to the
inside of the container.]

314
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,030
Why are you moving to the back?

315
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,360
Why do you keep moving back?

316
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,280
What is with Moon Chae Won?

317
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,350
[The container suddenly tilts.]

318

<i>We didn't start yet.</i>

322

What do you mean 'we didn't start'?

323
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,670
[It is hard to control their body movements
because of the sudden steepness.]

324
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,100

from the blue team.

531
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,090
[Whisper]

532
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,340
[Seung Gi succeeded in stealing a
glance at the hint?]

533
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,930
[Moving to the next mission place.]

534
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,360
Today's weather:

535
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,960
A place that makes oxygen in order to prevent
global warming always has clear skies.

536
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,420
Clear skies...

537
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,800
- That part is confusing.
- Right?

538
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,830
I think it's a tree.

539
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,890
It's a tree!

540
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,800
Let's take a look at the hint.

541
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,690
The main point is that it is a
tourist hot-spot.

542
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,280
It is a tourist hot-spot.

543
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,170
We're the only ones without a hint.

544
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,800
We only have what Seung Gi was
able to steal a glance at.

545
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,290
Tourist hot-spot.

546
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,290
High atmospheric pressure.

547
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,910
Why high atmospheric pressure?

548
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,690
It said, something because of
'high atmospheric pressure'...

549
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,340
High atmospheric pressure comes out
because it has something to do with weather.

550
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,800
If we think of it real simply,
it could just mean a high place.

551
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,870
If we don't get first place this time

552
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,560
I don't think we can win.

553
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,960
- We have to do it this time.
- We must get first place.

554
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,050
We need to get first place in this round.

555
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,000
- If we get last place then...
- It's over.

556
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
We need to return our car keys...

557
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,480
[What do these hints mean?]

558
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,610
[Ice Age]

559
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,370
What is this?

560
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,230
[Above white ice...
there is a table.]

561
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,420
It's like a restaurant.

562
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,950
What is this?

563
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,640
<i>I welcome everyone.</i>

564
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,900
[What age is this?]

565
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,740
<i>What age do you think this is?</i>

566
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,750
Ice Age!

567
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,010
Stone Age!

568
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,980
<i>Correct.
It is the Ice Age, Lee Seung Gi.</i>

569
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Kwang Soo doesn't know things like that.

570
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,960
<i>I welcome you to the Ice Age restaurant.</i>

571
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,390
<i>It is now the Ice Age so
everything has been frozen over.</i>

572
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:51,350
<i>You will do a mission that
has to do with food.</i>

573
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,350
<i>The first team to finish the mission
will come in first place.</i>

574
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,070
<i>The next teams will be in second and
third place respectively.</i>

575
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,450
There are currently two teams
that have won hints.

576
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,830
It is the first and second place.

577
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,670
If it's something to eat,
it is probably ice cream.

578
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,530
We will eat it even if our teeth fall out.

579
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,920
Stop talking on the side.

Since you don't have a hint
the hint about the last place

581
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,470
Seung Gi saw something.

582
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,840
Seung Gi saw something secretly.

583
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,910
- He didn't see everything but...
- Are you looking down on me right now?

584

585

And tourist hot-spot.

586
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,370
- When did you see the hint?
- Don't say anything.

587
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,210
I feel like she's going to say something.

588
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,660
If you know something say it.

589
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,190
Can they steal glances at the hint?

590
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,450
What is he talking about?

591
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,310
I didn't hear anything about the
high atmospheric pressure.

592
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,240
- It's the second place hint.
- It's not this way.

593
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,960
You need to put your hand
on the other side.

594
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,090
High atmospheric pressure and what?

595
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,000

598
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,740
You need to tell us something too.

[Tourist hot-spot is our hint.]

600
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,370

- You are the worst.
- Can they steal it from us?

604
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,460
We'll steal the hint too.

and see it later.

- I'm going to rip their clothes.
- Why would you rip our clothes?

884
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,400
Ready!

885
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,900
Gary, can you stand back a little?

886
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,360
It's just so funny so...

887
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,180
[A lot of preparation.
She's even putting her hat back.]

888
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,630
Ready?

889
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,100
You scared me.

890
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,650
Why are you closing your eyes?

891
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,270
This is heartwarming.

892
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,940
This is their first pepero game.

893
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,130
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's first
pepero game...]

894
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,260
[But Ji Hyo...]

895
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,820
[succeeded in 0.4 cm in the past
with Park Seo Jun.]

896
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,310
[And Jong Kook...]

897
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,590
[is Mr. Capable that succeeded in
0.3 cm with Ha Yeon Soo.]

898

[Mr. Capable and Ace]

899
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
[Their first pepero came will result in..?]

900
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,790
Start!

901
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,440
They might discover some feelings
that they didn't know about before.

902
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,090
[One bite]

903
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,770
[One bite]

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,510
[As they keep going...]

905
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,420
Do you two like...

906
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,120
[It ends in vain!]

907
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,630
Let's do it again!

908

[Blank]

909
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,360
What is this?

910
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,610
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo get the worst result.]

911
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,770
You two don't work together.

912
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,290
They just don't work together.

913
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,720
What doesn't work, doesn't work.

914
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,980
Gary likes it the most.

915
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,990
I though this would lead to
something new.

916
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,860

917
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,010
[Monday Couple forever!]

918

[They finally got a hint!]

920
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,140
We don't have any hints yet.

921
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,740
We should've done this.

922
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,190
Who got second place?

923
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,960
[Yellow team won in the ice cup
juice drinking game]

924
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,290
- It's me.
- What do you mean 'me?' It's 'us.'

925
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,720
It's ours.

926
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,230
Why is that important?

927
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,790
- It is important.
- Not yet.

928
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,540
The other team saw it before
because of you.

929
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,160
[Should I see it or not?]

930
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,710
I'm sorry.

931
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,020
We won't see it.

932
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,360
[Yoo Hyuk is eavesdropping.]

933
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,960
Today, this place...

934
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,910
Be quiet.
What's wrong with you?

935
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,250

936
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,610
[It's now!]

937
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,510
It's okay.

938

Why are you doing this?

939

I can't see it.

940
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,620
Can't we change our team?

941
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,530
Do we have to see it now?

942
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,830
Yes. You need to see it here.

Finished?

945
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,600
They don't know what it is
even if they do see it.

946
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,990
- First place.
- It's us!

947

948
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,530

00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
- You couldn't see it.
- I couldn't see it.

959

Wait! Gary, what are you doing?

963
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,530
I saw the letter.

964

[You can't let your guard down,
even at the last moment.]

You can take it.

971
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,170
If we can take it, why'd you
make us read it here!

972

twice a day', what?

986

Show myself twice a day?

988
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,690
It is a tourist hot-spot.

989
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:57,730
Today, the sun will shine as bright as the
temperature of the water at this place increases.

990
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,840
That means there is nice weather.
The water at this place?

991
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,710
The 'water' is the important point.

992

'The water at this place'...

993

has water.

996

become weird along with the weather changes.</i>

<i>And so, those people...</i>

1003
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,030

- I got it.</i>

We don't have any hints to
find it, right?

1008

Do we just look for it?

1009
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,980
Seung Gi, I have a favor
to ask of you.

1010
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,460
Can you stop acting like you know
something when you actually don't?

1011
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,050
Can you not do stuff like this?

1012
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,680
I understand.

1013
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,790
I'll ask you very calmly.

1014

He keeps on talking as if he
knows something.

1017

We're trying to prevent mutations
from occurring, right?

1018

<i>You're looking for the vaccine.</i>

1019
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,680
<i>The team of the person that finds
the vaccine wins.</i>

1020
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,520
One person out of the three of us
needs to find it.

1021
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,830
You know that I'm bad at finding
things like this, right?

1022
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,650
You two need to find it.

1023
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,390
It will be advantageous for us to
find the vaccine first.

1024
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,460
That way we can go first.

1025
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,510

There is nowhere here in which they
can deeply hide things.

hid it there.

Don't scream thoughtlessly.

1046

Scream only if you found
something for real.

1047

Let's promise each other.

1048

Why is there a jail when we were
just told to look for a vaccine?

What is this?

1057

00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,680
What?

1061
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,170
Why is Kim Jong Kook out?

1062
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,070
[Out of nowhere, they hear that
Mr. Capable is out.]

1063
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,410
What is this? Hurry up!

1064
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,880
What is this?

1065
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,130
[They just started but Mr. Capable is out!]

1066
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,780
Are we supposed to rip off
each other's name tags?

1067
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,220
[Confusion]

1068
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,190
Why is he out?

1069
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,870
Kim Jong Kook is out?

1070
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:36,260
What is going on?

1071
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,450
[One minute ago]

1072
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,710
[Kkuk and Blank Ji were calmly looking
for the R-vaccine...]

1073
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,990
Let's try going in there.

1074
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,680
[But]

1075
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,650
What is this?

1076
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,720
[A black being suddenly appeared.]

1077
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,420
This person is...

1078
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,040
[Monster]

1079
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,900
[Because of the unusual weather?]

1080
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,610
[This human became mutated.]

1081
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,920
[A life form full of anger.]

1082
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,090
[His name is 'Monster'.]

1083
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,610
[Symptoms of the Mutation:
Attacks all life forms other than itself]

1084
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,120
Why?

1085
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,390
[Lifts him up]

1086
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,540
[Mr. Capable levitates in the air.]

1087
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,390
[Super strength Monster suppresses
Mr. Capable at once.]

1088
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,490
He's fighter, Kim Ji Hoon.

1089
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,420
[It's a rare sight.
Mr. Capable is on the floor.]

1090
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,490
Why are you doing this to me?

1091
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,940
Why are you taking off my shoes?

1092
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,480
What are you doing?

1093
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,930
[Taking off the name tag has no
effect on the monster.]

1094
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,580
Why are you doing this?

1095
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,690
Why?

1096
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,170
What are you doing?

1097
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,610
[Monster completely captures Mr. Capable.]

1098
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,000
You have to tell me...

1099
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,940
[Stamp]

1100
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,090
[He stamps his foot?]

1101
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,400
What?

1102
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,330
What is this?

1103
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,720
I'm out?

1104
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,230
[Kim Jong Kook out!]

1105
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,150
[The greatest super strength Monster
has appeared!]

1106
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,700
Kim Jong Kook out!

1107
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,640
What?

1108
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,910
[He even drools because he's so shocked.]

1109
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,890
What is going on?

1110
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,860
What is this?

1111
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,660
Did he just say that Kim Jong Kook is out?

1112
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,080
What is going on?

1113
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,790
Why is Jong Kook out?

1114
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,100
[How can Mr. Capable be out?]

1115
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,280
It must not be related to
strength then...

1116
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,380
I know.

1117
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,500
It must have something to do
with using your head.

1118
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,550
[Seung Gi...]

1119
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,450
[You're very keen...]

1120
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,810
I think there is something else today.

1121
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,490
[I will greet you one by one.]

1122
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,160
Wait!

1123
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,060
Why do I feel so good?

1124
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,050
Why do I feel so good about
Kim Jong Kook being out?

1125
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,730
[He calms down and quickly looks for the vaccine.]

1126
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,500
This...

1127
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,940
[Ha Ha finds a R box.]

1128
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,230
There's nothing in here.

1129
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,800
If it's not in here then it's not this?

1130
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,030
[There is only one box that has
the real R-vaccine.]

1131
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,710
[He pushes back his fear and opens
every door that he can.]

1132
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,540
[Monster's second attack]

1133
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,770
Why are you doing this?

1134
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,260
[He lifts him up again]

1135
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,500
[and throws him down.]

1136
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,430
What?

1137
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,460
[Giraffe rushes to the scene as soon
as hears the scream.]

1138
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,290
Why are you doing this to me?

1139
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,140
[He runs after witnessing the
tragic hunting scene.]

1140
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,100
What do I do?

1141
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,760
[Monster has no mercy.]

1142
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,620
What are you doing?

1143
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,890
[If you get a stamp from the Monster
on your foot, you're out!]

1144
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,730
Ha Ha out!

1145
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,090
We're in big trouble.

1146
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,010
Who is that?

1147
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,190
Who is that person?

1148
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,600
[Fear increases by 10,000 times.]

1149
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,050
What?

1150
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,250
What is this?

1151
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,590
[The clueless members keep on
repeating 'what is this?']

1152
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,520
Someone is here.

1153
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,510
- Someone is here.
- Who's here?

1154
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,080
- Someone's here.
- Where?

1155
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,660
Someone who's in a black suit.

1156
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,370
He also has a name tag.

1157
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,380
What are you talking about?

1158
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,720
[Blank Ji saw Mr. Capable get taken
out with her own eyes.]

1159
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,600
You scared me!

1160
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,950
[M...Monster?]

1161
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,850
[Ji Hyo, it's me.]

1162
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,260
What's wrong with you?

1163
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,440
- Lee Seung Gi, you scared me!
- What?

1164
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,300
Go away!

1165
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,380
Don't come!

1166
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,610
Why are you running away?

1167
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,500
What's wrong?

1168
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,300
I don't know what's going on either.

1169
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,590
Someone's here.

1170
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,050
He's here.

1171
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,880
You scared me.

1172
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,780
[After seeing Monster you get
scared of everything you see.]

1173
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,470
Chae Won.

1174
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,030
There is someone here.

1175
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,860
Why were they taken out?

1176
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,190
What happened to Jong Kook?

1177
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,350
- Right now...
- There is a mutant here.

1178
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,450
There is someone with the virus.

1179
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,220
Let's go to the first floor.

1180
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,270
Aren't there anymore floors up there?

1181
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,270
There aren't any.

1182
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,650
There are only two floors?

1183
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,540
There are three floors.

1184
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,350
[Courageous Gary takes the lead.]

1185
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,130
[But...]

1186
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,140
[that was his last.]

1187
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,920
[The Monster is everywhere.]

1188
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,320
Why are you doing this?

1189
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,040
[Frightened]

1190
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,170
What is that?

1191
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,880
Then I'm the only one left.

1192
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,190
I saw it.

1193
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,420
In front of me!

1194
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,640
Wait!

1195
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,230
That hurts!

1196
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,150
[Monster's signature move: Thunder
take down then take off the shoes.]

1197
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,390
Stop it!

1198
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,890
Why are you doing this?

1199
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,060
Wait!

1200
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,140
[Once you're caught, it's over!]

1201
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,290
Gary out!

1202
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,050
[Absurd]

1203
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,710
What is this 'Monster?'

1204
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:37,080
[Should I speed up the process now?]

1205
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,770
[At the battlefield after the tsunami. ]

1206
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,550
- What's going on?
- Did you see his face?

1207
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,660
I couldn't see his face.

1208
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,850
He has a mask on.

1209
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,260
- He has on a mask.
- He was this big.

1210
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,150
He has a mask on and he looks as
if he weighs over 100 kg.

1211
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,950
He lifted up Ha Ha and
stuck him into the ground.

1212
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,340
Really?

1213
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,770
What happened to Jong Kook?

1214
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,480
If he took out Jong Kook then...

1215
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,160
He is a mixed martial arts fighter.

1216
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,370
He really is.

1217
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,590
He threw Jong Kook on the floor.

1218
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,900
- What did it say on his back?
- Monster.

1219
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,280
- Monster?
- Monster.

1220
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,170
Ripping off his name tag has
no effect on him.

1221
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,070
Really?

1222
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,760
We need to find the R-vaccine if we
want to capture him.

1223
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,700
But that person...

1224
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,330
He is a mutant.

1225
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,700
I need to take off my jacket.

1226
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,680
He's taking off his jacket.

1227
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,740
I need to use my strength today.
There is no other way.

1228
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,120
Kwang Soo...

1229
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,310
- You, really?
- Let's find the vaccine.

1230
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,690
I should take off my jacket too.

1231
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,610
I can't take this anymore.

1232
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,170
All the members on my team are out.

1233
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,940
What do I do? I'm alone.

1234
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,130
I need to find the vaccine.

1235
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,590
Where is it?

1236
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,030
Mommy!

1237
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:52,700
[Because of the tension,
the VJ freaked her out.]

1238
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,160
[Shock]

1239
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,510
Is she on the first floor?

1240
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,210
Let's look for it on the
second floor then.

1241
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,490
We're going to look for it
on the second floor.

1242
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,140
Let's look for it.

1243
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,030
It's Chae Won or Ji Hyo.

1244
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,900
If we get caught, it's over.

1245
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,170
[Let me live first]

1246
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,710
[The owner of the scream is...]

1247
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,640
[She thought the VJ was the Monster again.]

1248
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,050
[This is the first time Chae Won
has felt this kind of fear.]

1249
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,700
I keep thinking that the
camera guy is the mutant.

1250
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,000
There is a real one and a fake one.

1251
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,650
[One's heart leaps into one's mouth]

1252
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,860
[Hurriedly runs]

1253
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,900
[This time]

1254
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,590
[he's real.]

1255
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,650
[Let me get rid of all of you]

1256
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,430
[Shock]

1257
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,740
[A mess]

1258
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,010
[Hair stands up]

1259
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,250
[Monster brings with him the thrill
of a disaster movie.]

1260
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,250
[The place he ran to in
order to live is...]

1261
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,560
[where Blank Ji was hiding.]

1262
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,120
[Their souls have gone out]

1263
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,520
Don't come here!

1264
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,480
Did you see Suk Jin?

1265
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,890
I lived.

1266
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,880
I turned really nicely, right?

1267
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,920
[Where are they?]

1268
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,080
Let's take Monster out.

1269
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,370
How are you going to take him out?

1270
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,020
Should we punch him in the stomach?

1271
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,280
Do you think you'll be able to do it?

1272
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,560
You can...

1273
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,710
you can...

1274
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,050
get out!

1275
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,290
You try going out.

1276
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:52,460
The moment you punch his stomach, you'll
probably be laying down somewhere else.

1277
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,410
Be careful.

1278
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,020
[At this moment! A scream is heard
all throughout the building.]

1279
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,110
Don't go out!

1280
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,340
It's best not to join this kind of fight.
Come inside.

1281
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,020
[Big-Nosed Brother was celebrating
how he escaped.]

1282
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,060
[What's up?]

1283
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,920
[Few moments later he meets
Monster at a dead end.]

1284
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:18,540
How can we meet here?

1285
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,950
[He runs with his thin two legs but...]

1286
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,430
[it's too late.]

1287
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,430
How can we meet right there?
I'm so unlucky.

1288
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,430
[Ji Suk Jin out!]

1289
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,980
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out!</i>

1290
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,410
What are you doing?

1291
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,450
What is that?
What are you doing?

1292
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,690
You're out if you get stamped
on your feet.

1293
00:57:58,690 --> 00:57:59,910
So?

1294
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,600
I'm not leaving any space for
him to put a stamp.

1295
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,290
Why are you erasing it?

1296
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,290
Why?

1297
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,300
What do you think you're doing?

1298
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,960
[It's useless because spit can
even erase it.]

1299
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,310
There's not that many of us left now.

1300
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,200
How many of us are left?

1301
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,380
Chae Won.

1302
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,680
Ji Hyo.

1303
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,970
Jae Suk, Me, and Seung Gi.

1304
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,990
There's only five people left.

1305
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,960
Chae Won!

1306
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,080
Where have you been?

1307
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,610
[Drop]

1308
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,660
Why?

1309
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,710
I'm so tired.

1310
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,380
[Chae Won's legs are shaking from running
away and getting scared by her VJ.]

1311
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,460
What's going on?

1312
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,570
We have to find the R-vaccine first.

1313
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:43,480
Am I thinking too hard about this?

1314
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,900
Let's think of this in a simpler way.

1315
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,100
Someone...

1316
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,980
We just need to find it first.

1317
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,410
You don't need to use your
head for this game.

1318
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,670
- Who uses their brain in Running Man?
- It's not?

1319
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,130
You just need to look for it.

1320
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,100
[That's right!]

1321
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,720
[They need to find the vaccine first.]

1322
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:08,370
[That way they will find out how
to take out the Monster.]

1323
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,780
[What's wrong with him?]

1324
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,170
You scared me!

1325
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,840
It's on the third floor.

1326
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,970
[He scouted the Monster is through the
window in order to safely search for the vaccine.]

1327
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,250
What is the vaccine?

1328
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,470
What does the vaccine look like?

1329
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,720
I don't know.

1330
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,410
[The identity of the vaccine is a mystery.]

1331
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,720
[Sudden U-turn]

1332
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,550
[How are you?]

1333
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,660
[I'm not fine]

1334
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,420
[The Monster has come]

1335
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,710
[While the Yoo-Lee Brothers are being chased]

1336
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,130
[Seung Gi and Blank Ji run away.]

1337
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,380
Third floor.

1338
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,410
[Chae Won also heard the noise.]

1339
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,400
[Flustered]

1340
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,700
[She quickly hides in the corner]

1341
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,750
I lived..!

1342
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,980
[On the other hand]

1343
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,290
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo vs. Monster]

1344
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,140
[Eventually captured in the
corner of the staircase.]

1345
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,890
[Traitor Giraffe tries to grab Jae Suk
who's trying to get away.]

1346
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,500
[Jae Suk escapes]

1347
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,130
No!

1348
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,100
Don't!

1349
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,170
[It's not the foot he colored.]

1350
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,230
[Lee Kwang Soo out!]

1351
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,630
Who are you?

1352
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,580
[Monster seems to be out of breath.]

1353
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,110
What is this?

1354
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,120
He must really be into character.

1355
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,220
[I'm also a little tired.]

1356
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,740
[Collapsed]

1357
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,060
Lee Kwang Soo...

1358
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,840
Lee Kwang Soo held onto me.

1359
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,190
Lee Kwang Soo first...

1360
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:27,140
This intense tension...

1361
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,560
[Seung Gi has seen Monster
for the first time.]

1362
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,900
[He hurriedly looks for the vaccine.]

1363
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,770
Where is it?

1364
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,830
[Blank Ji is also alert.]

1365
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,490
It's crazy out there right now.

1366
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,230
I have to find it quickly.

1367
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,620
[Peek]

1368
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,510
[Found Blank Ji.]

1369
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,710
[He blocks the exit.]

1370
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,810
Can you let me off just once?

1371
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,490
Just once.

1372
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:14,930
Can you let me go one last time?

1373
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,730
When I get caught next time then...

1374
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,230
[I'm too tired now.]

1375
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,260
You could've let me off one last time.

1376
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,230
[Girls get stamped on their hand.]

1377
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,440
Song Ji Hyo, out!

1378
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,560
We need to find the vaccine first.

1379
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,000
Where is it?

1380
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,440
[The person that finds the vaccine
and takes out Monster wins!]

1381
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,600
[Therefore, the last person to remain
and look for the vaccine is important!]

1382
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,330
[Please]

1383
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,450
[Seung Gi looks everywhere without rest.]

1384
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,070
[He finally found the R box.]

1385
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,190
[There is something inside.]

1386
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,020
[He finally found...]

1387
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,120
[the vaccine bracelet.]

1388
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,790
[Deeply moved]

1389
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,610
[Thrilled]

1390
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,580
Where is he?

1391
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,980
[He just needs to put the bracelet
on the Monster!]

1392
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,540
Jae Suk!

1393
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,280
Where is it?

1394
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,530
Jae Suk!

1395
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,910
Yoo Jae Suk!

1396
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,720
[Since he doesn't know when the Monster
will appear, he is very uneasy!]

1397
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,670
Why is he so fast?

1398
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,670
Jae Suk!

1399
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,000
Come here!

1400
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,090
Where are you going?

1401
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,270
What about me?

1402
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,460
[However, he runs away from
all loud noises.]

1403
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,470
Jae Suk!

1404
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,530
This is 'Catch Yoo Jae Suk' right now!

1405
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,150
Did you find it?

1406
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,600
Seung Gi, did you find it?

1407
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,850
I found it.

1408
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,260
- Who found it?
- Me.

1409
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:06,200
Where did you find it?

1410
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,300
It's over once we put the
bracelet on him?

1411
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,490
- Can you lure him in?
- I also have chocolate to lure him in.

1412
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,520
- What is that?
- Chocolate.

1413
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,640
Did you get this from someone?

1414
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,300
- No.
- Is it yours?

1415
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,680
Why are you taking that?

1416
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,330
No!

1417
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:22,600
I'll put it on him, so can you lure him?

1418
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,620
Can you please lure him in?

1419
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,000
Hey!

1420
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,110
Give it to me.

1421
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,700
Hey! Give it to me.

1422
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,180
[Chae Won's weapon: Irresistible Smile]

1423
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,350
What are you going to do with this?

1424
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,360
Give it to me.

1425
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,950
Give me a chocolate then.

1426
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,240
[She first takes the bracelet.]

1427
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,290
[Then puts the chocolate in his mouth.]

1428
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,170
You need to walk around with me
from now on.

1429
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,480
Jae Suk.

1430
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,420
Why? I'm not on your team.

1431
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,560
I'm not on your team.

1432
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,500
Let's stick together.

1433
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,670
I was the one who found it.

1434
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,480
I gave you the chocolate.
Spit it out then!

1435
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,820
I'll buy one for you.

1436
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,770
Then you can put it on but

1437
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:10,360
after you put it on,
share the hint with me.

1438
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,140
Let me know what the hint is.

1439
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,470
I put this on that person.

1440
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,200
Then I'm in first place.

1441
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,430
Then I get the hint.

1442
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,750
But you want me to give my hint to you?

1443
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,760
There is now your hint and my hint.

1444
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,200
Give me the bracelet then! Forget it!

1445
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,160
Give me the bracelet!

1446
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,530
Spit out the chocolate!

1447
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,950
I'll give you the chocolate later.

1448
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,820
Share the hint.

1449
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:32,820
Promise me that.

1450
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,110
It doesn't matter who puts it on.

1451
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,010
That's not how it works. I gave you
the chocolate so this is mine.

1452
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,760
Call the mart and ask them to
deliver it to here.

1453
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,490
I'll give it to you as soon as
we get out of here.

1454
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,950
As soon as we leave this place.

1455
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,080
Jae Suk, come here.

1456
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,380
He's funny.

1457
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,520
Why?

1458
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,880
I found the vaccine.

1459
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,710
- So?
- I found it.

1460
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,590
- He's really funny.
- What is this?

1461
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,760
This is the vaccine.

1462
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,920
- He found it but...
- Then you have to put it on him.

1463
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,340
I asked him to give this to me
and gave him a chocolate.

1464
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,700
But he keeps asking for a hint.

1465
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,350
What are you talking about?

1466
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,530
What are are you two talking
about right now?

1467
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,510
Seung Gi found this.

1468
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,510
- I found this.
- Seung Gi found this.

1469
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,400
I had a chocolate and
Seung Gi found this.

1470
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,650
He was going to put this on him.

1471
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,790
Then he's first place.

1472
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,420
You guys are on the same team.

1473
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,420
- Yes.
- What is she talking about?

1474
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,020
What are you talking about right now?

1475
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,870
If Seung Gi found it,
then he has to put it on.

1476
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,640
No.
I gave him chocolate.

1477
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,850
Did you eat the chocolate?

1478
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,810
Wait here for a moment.
I'll go throw it back up.

1479
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:33,160
Just wait here for a moment.

1480
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,390
I'll go throw it back up.

1481
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,480
Why did you eat the chocolate?

1482
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,960
Chae Won, if Seung Gi found it then
he's supposed to put it on him.

1483
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,100
Then he has to give me back
the chocolate.

1484
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,650
What did it look like?

1485
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,490
I'll find it. Wait right here.

1486
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,830
We don't need to find the vaccine right
now. Let's find the chocolate first.

1487
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,440
Why did you give it to her?

1488
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,800
There are two people on our team.

1489
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,160
Then put it on him by yourself.

1490
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,140
- You put it on him yourself.
- I'm not going to help you at all.

1491
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,410
I'm going to just go and die.

1492
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,190
No. Help me.

1493
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,800
Should I help you or not?

1494
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,210
You’re good at this, Seung Gi.
I didn't even think of that.

1495
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,650
- I'm good at pushing and pulling.
- Yes you are.

1496
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,820
I'll put it on him. The person that
puts it on him is first place.

1497
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,090
You're first place so you just need
to share the hint with me.

1498
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,710
Understand? Promise.

1499
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:21,000
You have to put it on his wrist. You
can't slap him with it or something, okay?

1500
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,390
You can't put this on us, okay?

1501
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,510
You can't do that.
You have to put it on him.

1502
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,990
Jae Suk, let's be the bait.

1503
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,200
Hide this.

1504
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,240
[Let's go catch the monster]

1505
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,370
[Welcome]

1506
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,360
[Surprised]

1507
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,000
He's over there.

1508
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,290
- Is it him?
- It is him.

1509
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,420
Can you give me some water?

1510
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,380
[Now]

1511
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,730
[we face him]

1512
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,880
No.

1513
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,040
What should we do?

1514
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,290
[Danger]

1515
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,920
What should we do?

1516
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,110
It's not that.
Wait.

1517
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,920
We need to save the human race.

1518
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,180
Can I get some water?

1519
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,830
Can you give her some water?

1520
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:10,330
[She was going to put it on his wrist
when he handed her the water.]

1521
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,990
He must be weak when it
comes to women.

1522
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,020
Be careful.

1523
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,660
- Wait.
- Catch him!

1524
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,070
We can catch him?

1525
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,850
Is it okay for us to chase him?

1526
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,500
- Wait.
- Hurry!

1527
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,810
- Catch him!
- Can we catch him?

1528
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,210
[Is the bracelet going to be first
or the stamp?]

1529
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,560
He needs to stamp us.

1530
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,100
If he stamps us we're out.

1531
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,980
Wait. We need to move to
a larger space.

1532
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,380
Why aren't you catching him?

1533
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,220
[At this moment...]

1534
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,480
[He focuses on Yoo Hyuk]

1535
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,260
Wait!

1536
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,920
Put it on him!

1537
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,490
He dropped it.

1538
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,060
[Thankfully, Monster dropped the stamp.]

1539
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,620
What is this?

1540
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,370
We would've been in big trouble.

1541
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:00,940
It's the feet.

1542
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,650
It's the feet.

1543
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,110
He's really giving it his best!

1544
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,530
- It's not that!
- He smiled.

1545
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,440
He smiled.

1546
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,480
He needs to give it his best.

1547
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,230
He should just do enough
and go home.

1548
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,370
Chae Won, give that to me.

1549
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:21,630
The contract still holds, right?

1550
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,350
Of course!

1551
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,470
Chae Won, you can't put it
on him yourself.

1552
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,490
Chae Won give it to me.

1553
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,150
We'll keep our promise.

1554
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,270
- We'll show you the hint.
- Promise?

1555
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,880
- Of course.
- You promised.

1556
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,280
Everyone saw this, right?

1557
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,910
[At this moment]

1558
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,140
[Monster attacks Seung Gi!]

1559
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,940
[Monster is aiming for Seung Gi's feet.]

1560
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,220
[Chae Won is defending with her whole body.]

1561
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:51,990
Hold on a little longer!

1562
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,440
It doesn't go on his arm.

1563
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,150
Not the arm then.

1564
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,850
[Chae Won throws her whole body.]

1565
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,420
[His wrist is open.]

1566
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,810
[Jae Suk!]

1567
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,390
[Hurry..!]

1568
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,570
[Click]

1569
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,980
We put it on him!

1570
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,530
[Putting the bracelet on
Monster's wrist is a success!]

1571
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,840
We put it on him!

1572
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,620
Nice work today.

1573
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,460
Aren't you a mixed martial arts fighter?

1574
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,820
How did you come all the way here?

1575
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,070
[Road FC Kim Ji Hoon]

1576
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:43,380
Please give him a round of applause.

1577
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,740
You did a really nice job!

1578
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,460
By himself he...

1579
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,100
[Thank you for your appearance.]

1580
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,530
Then now all that's left is the
Blue team's hint.

1581
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,770
Chae Won made a deal
with us before.

1582
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,260
We will tell you the hint
that we received.

1583
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:07,070
It is the place
that Running Man likes the best.

1584
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,230
- The place that Running Man likes the most.
- That's the hint?

1585
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:15,450
- I think I know where it is.
- That is the key point.

1586
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,250
We just have to put all the
hints together now.

1587
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,470
Okay.

1588
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,990
I feel like this was a losing business.

1589
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,060
It is a tourist hot-spot with water.

1590
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,660
- Tourist hot-spot.
- Sokcho!

1591
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,030

There is a lot of water there. Creeks!

1593
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,900
What do you think it is?

1594
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,090
We just need one more hint.

1595
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:43,630
- It is the place that RM likes the most...
- it shows itself twice a day.

1596
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,200
- I don't know.
- I really don't know.

1597
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,360
[Where is the place?]

1598
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,450

1601

What is this?

1602
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,710
[In the studio]

1603
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,760

[What is the meaning behind the nine
topographical photos?]

01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,560
<i>It is the final mission.</i>

1607
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,830
<i>Currently there is a rainstorm
alert all over the world.</i>

1608
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:31,140
<i>There is only one topographical area
in which the sun will rise.</i>

1609
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,980
It's too difficult.

1610
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,060
<i>Put your hints together</i>

1611
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,890

topographical area</i>

1612

<i>will have a sunrise out of the nine.</i>

1613
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:51,680
[It is a tourist hot-spot with a lot of water.]

1614

[It's a place that Running Man likes
that shows itself twice a day.]

1616
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,460
With our hint, it's this place.

1617
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,370
Let's just go with this.

1618
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,110
This is the only place we can go with.

1619
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:18,380
<i>Now each team can step on their
choice and wait for the results.</i>

1620
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,440
<i>For the team that gets it right,
there will be bright sunlight.</i>

1621
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,440
<i>For the team that doesn't get it right...</i>

1622
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,490
Clouds, there are a lot of clouds.

1623
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,620
<i>If they get it wrong, they
will be rained on.</i>

1624
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,220
<i>Take off the microphone.</i>

1625
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,810
We should take off our jackets.

1626
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,280
In case we get rained on, we should.

1627
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,380
[Everyone removes their
microphone and jacket.]

1628
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,660
[Yoo Hyuk surpasses Park Seri's
bare foot fighting spirit.]

1629
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,530
[Which region out of these is the safe region?]

1630
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,360
Move at the count of three, please.

1631
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,460

[Each team makes their decision]

1636

What is this?

1637

[All three teams head to the same spot.]

1638
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,930
Everyone chooses this place?

1639

I think I know what it is.

1644
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,190
Running Man loves mud flats the most.

1645
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,930
Did you guys go the the mud flats a lot?

1646
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,140
We went there a lot.

1647
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,170

01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,160
- I know.
- What is it?

1653
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,310
This is the mud flats of the west coast.

1654
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,470
I am 100% sure of this.

1655
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,110
Twice a day.

1656
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:23,150
The tide comes in and out.

1657
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,820
And doesn't Running Man like
the sea the most?

1658
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,010

twice a day.

1659

regions at the studio...]

Are you sure it's this?

1672
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,950
Our hint tells us it's this region.

1673
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,810

and a volcano.</i>

1674

<i>Let us check to see if it is
one of those regions.</i>

1675
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,290
We can tell by listening to the sound.

the middle row either!]
