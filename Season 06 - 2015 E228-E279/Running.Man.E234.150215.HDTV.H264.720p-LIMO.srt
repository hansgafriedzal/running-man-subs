[She's on the boat to cross the river...]

174
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,250
[in the same outfit as Gary.]

175
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,250
Sung Ryung!

176
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,650
[Gary's partner,
Kim Sung Ryung.]

177
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,650
Sung Ryung!

178
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,150
[Gary...]

179
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,800
Sung Ryung!

180
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,300
[Gary and Sung Ryung
meet in Bangkok.]

181
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,425
Sung Ryung!

182
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,650
You oust me as soon as we meet?

183
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,350
I really wanted to eliminate a name tag.

184
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,275
- Please put it back.
- This is fun.

185
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:48,225
Sung Ryung, are you ready for this?

186
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,420
I'm always ready.

187
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,550
- You don't mind to work with me?
- I don't.

188
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,375
- Did you put lots of sun block?
- Why? Is my makeup cakey?

189
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,370
No, you're beautiful as always.

190
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:05,300
[Finally, everyone
found their partners.]

191
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,150
[It's time to receive the mission.]

192
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,720
- Hello! Good morning!
- Hello!

193
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,475
You don't let me wash up
even in Hong Kong?

194
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:20,400
- This is the new year's special.
- Is it?

195
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,550
I will give you the mission.

196
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,350
Hello, Running Man.

197
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,125
I'm the winner of the 2014 New Year's
Cooking Battle, Song Kyung Ah.

198
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,870
Hello, everyone!

199
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,950
[The winner of 2014 Cooking Battle,
Song Kyung Ah.]

200
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,600
[She made a good team with Jong Kook.]

201
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,900
[Healthy chicken stew and fresh Kimchi.]

202
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,250
[They won
with their well-being dish.]

203
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,625
I haven't seen her for a long time.

204
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:54,400
We had a cooking battle last year.
Song Kyung Ah and I were the winners.

205
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,750
Song Kyung Ah and Jong Kook were the winners.

206
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,225
Song Kyung Ah won
last year's cooking battle.

207
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:07,100
You can guess
why I'm giving you the mission.

208
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,350
It's because the New Year's
Cooking Battle has come back.

209
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,800
Today's mission is cooking, then.

210
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,900
- Are you good at cooking?
- Are you good at cooking?

211
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,600
Not really, just a little.

212
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,850
I'm not really good at it.

213
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,575
- You're a mother of three children!
- That's exactly why!

214
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm going to tell you the rules.

215
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,470
You have to get the ingredients
with your partner

216
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,125
learn a secret recipe, and
make the most delicious dish.

217
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,050
<i>It looks like it's Kimchi, but not.
The dish seems like it's Kimchi.</i>

218
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,920
Pardon?

219
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,000
<i>It looks like it's Kimchi, but not.
The dish seems like it's Kimchi.</i>

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,200
- What? I don't know how!
- Kimchi?

221
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,575
- Isn't it Kimchi?
- I've never made Kimchi before.

222
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:10,450
- Do you usually buy Kimchi?
- Yes. And people give me.

223
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,100
We have prepared five kinds of Kimchi.

224
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,800
Old fermented Kimchi, whole cabbage Kimchi

225
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,425
cut radish Kimchi, young radish Kimchi

226
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,200
and white cabbage and radish Kimchi.

227
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,220
You can choose one of these
and make a dish

228
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,650
along with other ingredients
that you will get.

229
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:39,350
Wait, do you remember
that I won the golden horse trophy?

230
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,300
Thanks to me, Jong Kook got it, too.

231
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you take a good care of it,
Jong Kook?

232
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,800
I won the gold.
Of course, I remember.

233
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,025
Last year was the year of the horse.

234
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:56,600
Jong Kook and Kyung Ah won
the golden horse trophies.

235
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,300
Is it the golden goat trophy this time?

236
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,325
- I was born in the year of the goat.
- Were you?

237
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:06,100
Do your best, just like I did last time.

238
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,125
I hope you win the great prize!

239
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:15,400
Then, 2015's New Year
Cooking Battle now begins!

240
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,625
Let's go!

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Last year

242
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,900
I did most of the work.

243
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,600
- People don't know...
- What are you talking about?

244
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,000
They said our presentation was great.

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,225
You talk too much!

246
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,700
- We need to think of an idea first so...
- What a nagger!

247
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,350
let's do our best to win.
- I understand.

248
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,900
Cooking isn't my area.

249
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,120
I wont' be able to win.
Aren't you good at cooking?

250
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,170
- I try to do it well.
- That's great!

251
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,320
I like the fact that
the main theme is Kimchi.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,450
What do we need to get for the ingredients?

253
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,570
- First, you can go here.
- Where is it?

254
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,475
Find Madame Choi Geum Ja?
Madame Choi Geum Ja?

255
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:14,100
- Then, she will be teaching us...
- That's right.

256
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,600
the secret recipe?

257
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,975
Is she your mother?

258
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:23,300
- No, she's not my mother.
- Isn't this your hometown?

259
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,625
No, you know my father...

260
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,800
Oh, I forgot!

261
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,000
I thought about your wife
and forgot about your father.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,275
You must be embarrassed.
That's right. Your mom is in Seoul.

263
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:42,600
I forgot about that.
Can we just go here?

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,300
Let's go.

265
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
[At the moment, no one knew]

266
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,575
[what would happen
on the day of the battle.]

267
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,900
[The judges with harsh criticism.]

268
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,200
[A cry burst out in the
middle of the cooking battle?]

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,200
[Find the ingredients and the secret recipe
throughout Korea and Asia.

270
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,625
Sawadikap! (Hello!)
Kokunkap! (Thank you!)

271
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,100
I greeted in Thai, because I just got
back from Thailand.

272
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,600
[First impression of Sung Ryung?]
There were a lot of guests.

273
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,370
But she's one of the guests that
made my heart flutter.

274
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,075
There were three guests so far.

275
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,200
Oh Hyun Kyung

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Oh Yeon Soo

277
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,600
and Sung Ryung.

278
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Why do I like ladies
that are older than me?

279
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,700
Anyway, my heart was singing of joy.

280
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,800
[What's their first mission?]
- Let's begin.

281
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,900
Tada! Our first mission!

282
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,200
Go find this person by three pm
and get the invitation for the battle.

283
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,600
First, take a Tuk Tuk and go to Khaosan Road.

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,020
Have you ever been to Khaosan Road?
- No, I haven't.

285
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:03,050
I guess we need to meet
this person for the mission.

286
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,700
Sawadikap! (Hello!)

287
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,300
I think it'll be nice if we can get
some street food on the way.

288
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
[Arriving at Khaosan Road.]

289
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,325
[Khaosan Road] a short street
in central Bangkok.

290
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:34,100
[It's a world famous backpackers' street
and famous for street food. ]

291
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,600
Are you okay?

292
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,300
You seem tired
but this is only the beginning.

293
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,800
Isn't this an R flag?

294
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,225
What kind of a crude indication is this?

295
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:51,200
[What kind of mission is waiting
for them at Khaosan Road?]

296
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Eat the top three street foods of Bangkok

297
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,200
and get R stickers.

298
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,170
Find Ma Muang, Kwetiau Kai, Itim Kati
out of these numerous street foods.

299
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,550
Let's go. Ma Muang?

300
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,900
- Do we need to find these?
- Yes.

301
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,875
All of a sudden, I feel hungry.

302
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,220
He's handsome.

303
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,100
Sung Ryung!
She's weird!

304
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,720
She keeps saying that he's handsome.

305
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,220
Let's go ask.

306
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,025
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Where are you from?

307
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:37,000
- Denmark.
- Denmark? I'm from Korea.

308
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,700
We're from Korea.

309
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,375
She is... Miss...

310
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,600
Miss Korea

311
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,000
long time ago.

312
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,970
She told me you're handsome.

313
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,575
You're handsome, too.

314
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,900
- How is she?
- Beautiful.

315
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,175
Beautiful?

316
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:12,700
- Do you know Ma Muang?
- No.

317
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
Thailand food, Ma Muang?

318
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,700
No, I'm so sad.
Thank you.

319
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,000
- Nice to meet you. I love Denmark.
- Hope you enjoy being here. Bye!

320
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,400
- Sung Ryung.
- There are many handsome people here.

321
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,800
[This is the hottest traveler's spot
Khaosan Road.]

322
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,720
[This is paradise.]

323
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,100
You gave us a mission
that's not even in Korean

324
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,200
to give us a hard time.

325
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,800
I guess that's the fun of
being on Running Man.

326
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I only watched Running Man on TV.
but running around

327
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
actually made me want to win
just like Gary said.

328
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,700
It made me active and not shy.

329
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
It was very fun.

330
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,625
That looks romantic.

331
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:13,500
Wait, Ma Muang...
Look! They have food there.

332
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,600
[They find a food cart]

333
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,500
[with delicious looking fruits.]
- Ma Muang?

334
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,400
Ma Muang?
Do you know Ma Muang?

335
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,100
- Ma Muang!
[He points at a fruit .]

336
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Mango?
Is this right?

337
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,600
- Okay, okay. Let's pay first.
[Ma Muang means mango in Thai.]

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
I will put it on a stick for you.

339
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,800
[Sung Ryung tastes it first.]
- How is it?

340
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,400
- It's good.
[Thai Mangoes are big and sweet.]

341
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,700
It's really good.

342
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,550
Kwetiau Kai?
Kwetiau Kai?

343
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,650
[He understood right away?]

344
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,600
[He points at another food cart.]

345
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,500
Kwetiau Kai? Right?
Eat one more, Sung Ryung.

346
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,575
- I need to eat the next snack.
[Look at you!]

347
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:17,200
You've succeeded.

348
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,300
[They succeed in eating Ma Muang.]

349
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,570
We did it.

350
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,050
Kwetiau Kai.

351
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,600
[Let's go get some Kwetiau Kai.]

352
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,275
[Hot broth and delicious looking chicken.]

353
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,520
- Kwetiau Kai?
- Yes, it is.

354
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,225
[They come to the right place.]

355
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,570
We can choose the sauce.

356
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,350
- It looks like rice noodles.
[Put some chicken on the rice noodles.]

357
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,025
We can eat a lot of this.
We love this.

358
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,900
- How much is it?
[Add the toppings.]

359
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,150
[Pour the hot broth.]

360
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,825
[Thai rice noodle, Kwetiau Kai.]
- Try it.

361
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,800
- It's good.
- Is it? It looks good.

362
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm surprised.

363
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,525
What do they call coriander here?

364
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:23,520
It's good, right?

365
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,220
- It will be good with white Kimchi?
- Yes. It will.

366
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,500
We can replace these vegetables
with white Kimchi.

367
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,820
It's really good.
The bean sprout is good, too.

368
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,075
[They succeeded in eating
the second street food.]

369
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:42,300
Excuse me, do you know
'Gangnam Style' dance?

370
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,100
No, do you know 'Up and Down'?

371
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,600
'Up and Down'?
I'll teach you.

372
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,900
- Come here.
- Where are you from?

373
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,700
- I'm from Spain.
- Spain?

374
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,625
She's Miss Korea.

375
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,800
Okay, I'll show you 'Up and Down.'

376
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,325
Everybody!
One, two, three, four!

377
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:20,575
<i>Up, down, up, up, and down.</i>

378
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:25,900
- His pronunciation is good.
- Up and down is ''Wi A-re".

379
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,550
- Up and down is ''Wi A-re", okay.
- Okay, have fun!

380
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,950
[It's time to find the last street food.]

381
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,425
My song should have been playing.

382
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:39,300
[Bulkyo, Korea.]

383
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,500
So, we'll have to cook.

384
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
We have to use Kimchi but

385
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,600
we should find something famous
around here first

386
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,500
Then we can make some kind of
fusion food using Kimchi.

387
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,920
You know cooking is an interpretation.

388
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,375
You need to show the judges
how much effort you've put in.

389
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,900
I'm close to Kang Leo,
he's my friend.

390
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,700
- You know who Kang Leo is?
- I know.

391
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,300
There's gonna be a judge
that will be very serious for sure.

392
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:14,600
[Why am I getting tired already?]

393
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,500
Wait, can you stop talking
for a moment?

394
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,970
You talk too much while you drive.

395
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,420
We should keep talking about the idea.

396
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,925
- You're not a rapper, are you?
- No, I've been singing the melody.

397
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:32,500
You almost sound like you're rapping.

398
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,900
[It would have been a waste,
if he just sang.]

399
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,500
I was on the Running man
'Thanks Giving Special' last year.

400
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,900
I've gotten close to Min Seo who was
on the show with me.

401
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,950
She told me a lot about Jong Kook.
That he nags a lot.

402
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,550
As soon as I saw Jong Gook today,
I thought it might be tiring.

403
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,700
As you already saw...
(he made me feel tired.)

404
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,300
[For another 30 minutes,
Teacher Kkuk's sermon continued...]

405
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,325
[Finally arriving at the mission site.]

406
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,550
[Is this the mission site?]

407
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,450
This mudflat... is not... an ordinary one.

408
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,400
[Mudflats... how far does it stretch out?]

409
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:38,450
[Jong Kook and Seo Woo's mission
is to dig out 1,000 red shells.]

410
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,775
- Can we start?
- Yes.

411
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,550
[Let's go to the mudflat.]

412
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,075
This is the
'Let's go to the mudflat' dance.

413
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:53,675
That is the
'Let's go to the mudflat' dance?

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,125
You're missing out.
You need to twist your legs like this.

415
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:04,200
- I can't move like that but...
- You need to move your legs.

416
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,425
[They make us feel uneasy
from the beginning.]

417
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm not scared! I'm not!

418
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,300
I'm scared of you!

419
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
Can we get off now?

420
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,300
You can get off now.
Be careful.

421
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,400
Hello!

422
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,100
They're getting ready to dig out
the red shells, too.

423
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,500
You know we can't really count
1,000 red shells.

424
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,525
They say it's about ten Kilograms.

425
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:41,100
[Have you even been to any mudflats?]
- It was first time to be in a mudflat.

426
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I had no idea how
I can dig out the red shells.

427
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,150
I thought, 1,000 shells for a show?
No way...

428
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,725
I didn't think they would actually
make us to dig out 1,000 shells.

429
00:28:56,075 --> 00:29:00,600
[Kkuk is getting a mud sled.]

430
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,750
Are we really going to start?

431
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,200
[Even the Running Man members
haven't been in this kind of mudflat.]

432
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,375
Give it to me.
I can tell our sled is a good one.

433
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,770
[His legs fall into the mud.]

434
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,275
[The mudflat welcomes him.]

435
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,100
[Mommy, the ground is pulling me.]

436
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,700
This sled is in good condition.

437
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,000
[The other ladies already arrived.]

438
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,175
Then, let's go!

439
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,100
[They push with all the strength.]

440
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,300
[Seo Woo moves forward with her scream.]

441
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,800
Can you move?
I'll pull it for you.

442
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,500
What should I do?

443
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,900
Let's go!

444
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,175
The sled moves well.

445
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:14,700
[Mr. Capable learns how to control
the mud sled right away.]

446
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,000
This is tiring.

447
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Do you think you can handle this?

448
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,800
- Father, I'll be there in a minute!
- What are you doing?

449
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,700
- Hurry up and come.
- I'm almost there.

450
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Seo Woo, it's going to be
difficult to pass here.

451
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,100
She didn't listen to Kkuk.

452
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,000
Please save me.

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,320
[Seo Woo is fighting with the mudflat.]

454
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,700
[What kind of partner is Seo Woo?]

455
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,800
She's a handful.

456
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,700
She can't do a lot by herself.

457
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,400
You need to stay by her side and
take care of her all the time.

458
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:12,225
[She moves forward little by little.]

459
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,875
Father!

460
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,600
You're doing well!

461
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,700
- Keep it going!
- Father!

462
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,775
[Just let me go, mudflat!]
- Wait!

463
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:27,400
Wait there!
Father is on the way!

464
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,125
You can't imagine how hard it is.

465
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:37,025
You keep falling into the mud
if you can't control the sled.

466
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:40,175
I'm more than a handful.

467
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:43,975
I feel so sorry.
I have nothing to say.

468
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,175
It's harder to go backward.
Did you get out?

469
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,550
I got out!

470
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm already tired.

471
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
[They both arrive to the working field.]

472
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,225
[Will they be able to
dig out 1,000 red shells?]

473
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:04,025
[Bulkyo]

474
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:06,100
[Jungsun]

475
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,900
I heard that you're good at cooking.

476
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Don't you cook at home?

477
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
My wife cooks well.

478
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,500
Really?
What food is she good at making?

479
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,825
She's good at everything.

480
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:23,700
- She makes good Rich Soybean Paste Stew.
- Really?

481
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,000
She's pretty, is kind to your parents,
kind to you, a good cook, and a good actress.

482
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,325
[She is my wife.]

483
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:36,600
- I feel embarrassed.
- But that's what you just said.

484
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,800
I think we're here.

485
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,200
I think this is the house
of Madame Choi Geum Ja. Let's get off.

486
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,300
Hello!

487
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,300
This is Yeon Jung Hoon here.

488
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,975
Madame Choi Geum Ja,
is she the great Jang Geum of Jungsun?

489
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,725
Yes, she is.

490
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,800
I think I saw you on TV.

491
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,100
Yes, I'm on TV.

492
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,750
Come help me here.

493
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,700
Are you by chance, Madame Choi Geum Ja?

494
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,025
- Yes, I am.
- The jewel in Jungsun!

495
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:27,275
- She's making tofu now.
- She's making tofu?

496
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:29,800
Making tofu?

497
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,650
[Master of traditional food,
the great Jang Geum of Jungsun.]

498
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,900
Can we help you?
I came with Yeon Jung Hoon.

499
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,200
- Where is he?
- He's here.

500
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,400
- Hello!
- His father is Yeon Kyu Jin.

501
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
I see.

502
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,500
His wife is Han Ga In.

503
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,900
- I'm 'Hanga' (not busy) today.
- I mean...

504
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,400
[She only thinks about tofu now.]

505
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,925
I thought you just took out
a beating stick.

506
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:08,200
- Can we help you with that?
- Yes, please.

507
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,425
Put this boiled soy milk
through the cheese cloth.

508
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,500
- I ground the soy beans.
- This is going to be so good!

509
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,850
This silken tofu tastes
totally different from factory-made ones.

510
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,900
[The genuine taste of homemade tofu.]

511
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:34,300
We also use the soy beans that we grow.

512
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,575
Where are you?

513
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,700
I can't see anything.

514
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,325
It smells nutty.

515
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,600
Suddenly, it feels like the show
'Korean Cuisine and Dining'.

516
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,950
You know the program, right?
Choi Bul Am is the host.

517
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,600
He visited my house, too.

518
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,375
- Did he visit here?
- He came for his second episode.

519
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:03,420
- You were on the show?
- Yes.

520
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,450
She is indeed
the great Jang Geum of Jungsun.

521
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,800
Korean Cuisine and Dining
came to look for you.

522
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,600
It means you're the great chef.

523
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
I'm not good at cooking.
I'm a country bumpkin.

524
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,050
But you were on
Korean Cuisine and Dining.

525
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,350
I just move my fingers to mix the food.

526
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,500
You moved your fingers for
Korean Cuisine and Dining?

527
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,600
- We know it's not that easy.
- But we never use MSG.

528
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,600
We don't use unnecessary seasonings.

529
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,020
- Is this the silken tofu?
- It's going to be.

530
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,100
[Add the bittern in the filtered soy milk
and the tofu hardens.]

531
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:53,100
[She gives the pot full of tofu
to Jung Hoon and Jae Suk.]

532
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,620
This is how the tofu is made.

533
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,700
[Wrap the silken tofu with cloth.]

534
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,325
[Press it with something heavy
for about 20 minutes]

535
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:06,000
[to get rid of excessive liquid.]

536
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:11,725
[All you have to do is wait.]

537
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,200
Can you bring
some Dongjimi(dialect) for me?

538
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,675
Do you mean Dongchimi?
(Water based radish Kimchi.)

539
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:23,700
It's going to be very cold.
Let me give you some gloves.

540
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,700
[She thinks the coldness
of Kangwon Province is harsh for them.]

541
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,125
[And she gives them
a pair of vinyl gloves.]

542
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:37,900
- My hands might still be cold.
- I know they will be.

543
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,250
I think it'll be better than nothing.
[Mother's love.]

544
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,070
I think we can have
snow ball fights with these.

545
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,900
[A trying time for
the young master from Seoul.]

546
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,200
He'll get some Dongchimi for you.

547
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Is it where I get Dongchimi?
Wow, it's under the ground?

548
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,800
[Traditional way of storing Kimchi.]

549
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,600
Is it frozen?

550
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,650
Madame gave me these gloves.
I will get it.

551
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,100
[Even the smell is different.]

552
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:29,300
- I brought Dongchimi.
- Add some water.

553
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,100
- Can you peel this for me?
- That's a potato.

554
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,425
- Peels (dialect).
- Pardon me?

555
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:37,600
You can put the peels over here.

556
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,400
Peels.

557
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,700
- Potato peels, Jung Hoon.
- Aha!

558
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,300
- Don't I need to wash it?
- You don't need to wash it.

559
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,100
- My hands are frozen.
- Your hands are frozen?

560
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,500
Yes.

561
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,100
My hands are frozen.

562
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,100
You're a typical...

563
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,400
man from a city.

564
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,800
I can tell you've never done this before.
You're even worse than me.

565
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,575
- You try then.
- Move over.

566
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:25,000
I can tell you never help at home.

567
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Han Ga In does all the work.

568
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Look how I do it.
Just like this.

569
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,400
- That's too thick!
- How can you not help at home?

570
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,300
- You're wasting it.
- Just like this!

571
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
How long do you need to peel it?
A day?

572
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:46,600
Aren't you doing it
for the first time?

573
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,825
Ga In, you're doing a lot of work.
I can tell.

574
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:53,200
[Grasshopper never stops talking.]

575
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,850
He's too much.
See? How fast I'm doing it?

576
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,050
Kyeung Eun (Jae Suk's wife),
I feel bad for you.

577
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,000
I was the MC for Jung Hoon
and Ga In's wedding.

578
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
I have a connection with the couple.

579
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,200
Ga In is a close friend of mine.
Although we don't call each other.

580
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,900
Why? There are people who's close
but don't call each other.

581
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,700
She's still a close friend.

582
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,000
Jung Hoon's father is also a senior
in the entertainment business.

583
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,100
You know when the connections
meet together

584
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,900
positive things can amplify the synergy.

585
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
I think we'll have a good luck.

586
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,800
By the way

587
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,000
we have a cooking battle tomorrow.

588
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,500
Can you suggest what we can make?

589
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,700
You can make traditional food.

590
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Traditional food?
What is it?

591
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,400
You can make buckwheat porridge soup.

592
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,500
- With buckwheat?
- Yes.

593
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,675
- Put one spoon.
- One spoon?

594
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,100
We should watch her carefully.

595
00:39:57,406 --> 00:40:03,701
[Pour in the soaked buckwheat
once soybean soup starts to boil.]

596
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,309
[When buckwheat is near finished cooking,
add in the mushrooms and the plum extract.]

597
00:40:07,344 --> 00:40:10,818
- How much? Would one spoonful be enough?
- Yes, one spoonful should be plenty.

598
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,100
- What else do I put in here?
- Then you add in the secret ingredient.

599
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:18,168
[The secret ingredient, aged soybean paste,
is added into the soup mixture.]

600
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,755
[Young master from Seoul tries a taste.]

601
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:30,200
- How does it taste?
- It tastes the same.

602
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:35,263
- Does it not taste very good?
- I don't taste the aged soybean paste.

603
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:39,679
If it doesn't taste very good,
then I add in a little bit of MSG.

604
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:44,321
[The master's cool solution to the problem.]

605
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,570
MSG?

606
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,927
- What else am I to do then?
- I thought you said you never use MSG.

607
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:51,848
What else can I do? I have to add some
if it doesn't taste very good.

608
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:56,113
She just told us that we can add in a
little bit of MSG if we need to.

609
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:59,752
No, I don't think we're going to need any.
I think it'll be good on its own.

610
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:02,639
[She pulls out her secret stash of MSG
that she'd prepared just in case.]

611
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,734
[MSG Grasshopper launches into action.
Dumps in the MSG without any hesitation.]

612
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,136
- Did you let it come to a boil?
- Yes.

613
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,812
- We still have to add in the tofu.
- Can we add that in now?

614
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:19,908
You sound so much more relaxed now.

615
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,346
[Young master Seoul tries another taste.]

616
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,884
[Yes, this is the good stuff!]

617
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:29,109
There it is.

618
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,016
I can taste the goodness now.
Ma'am, we're all set now.

619
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,464
[Tofu finishes cooking while they learn
the art of making buckwheat porridge soup.]

620
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,007
Wow, that looks so delicious.

621
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:52,380
[Being generously liberal with her
fresh and delicious tofu.]

622

[Buckwheat porridge is finally ready.]

623
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:58,699
[Buckwheat porridge is a traditional dish
made with tofu, soybean sprouts and potatoes.]

624
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,963
- Please sit, and we'll bring the rice.
- Have some silken tofu, too.

625
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:04,222
Yes, thank you.

626
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,520
It's good.

627
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:13,066
[Sweet words of compliment to
the two hard working young men.]

628
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:18,629
Sir, this really is delicious.
We'll enjoy eating it, too.

629
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,766

like one happy family.]

[Even the silken tofu tastes like honey.]

632
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,281
This really isn't bad.

633
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:40,666
- What are you thinking about?
- Thinking about what we learned.

634
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:44,288
I completely trust you, Jung Hoon.

635
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:51,434
- Ma'am, this was such a delicious meal.
- I should be the one to thank you guys.

636
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,809
- No, there's no need to thank us.
- That really was a delicious meal.

637

Buckwheat soybean porridge.

638
00:42:57,065 --> 00:43:00,203
That with the tofu really was
a fantastic meal together.

639

[Thus, secrets of the legendary dish
gets passed down to another.]

shining brightly atop the tall buildings...]

- I just asked him how long it would take.

653
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:59,913
He said at the speed we're going,
it's going to take about 20 minutes.

- I'm hungry.

I had a really great time.

657

This is a market.
I've been here before.

662

You have to beat the employee in a game of
rock-paper-scissors for both of you to eat.

663

Can't you just let us eat breakfast?

00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:38,579
[Even gets a lesson on sea creatures
before starting their mission.]

833
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:42,055
- Can I try it?
- Sure, you can try it.

834
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:47,978
This sea cucumber was caught by
these ladies just moments ago.

835
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:50,232
- We just caught this ourselves.
- Wow, this is just so fresh.

836
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:54,371
- I've never seen one so big.
- I think this is the biggest I've seen, too.

837
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:56,255
It's the red sea cucumber.

838
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:03,163
- Try a piece now.
- Go on and eat.

839
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:06,167
This is so delicious.

840
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:08,881
This is such a rare treat.

841
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,343
- Ma'am...
[What about their mission?]

842
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,608
What is our mission?

843
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:17,343
'Men-do-rong Tto-Tto-hol Ttae,
Hwak Deul-li-jap-Suk, mehrong.'

844
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,855
Excuse me?
I didn't understand you.

845
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:25,243
'Men-do-rong Tto-Tto-hol Ttae,
Hwak Deul-li-jap-Suk, mehrong.'

846
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:28,215
[Blank...]

847
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:30,763
[Are you okay?
Caught off guard, aren't you?]

848
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:33,459
'Men-do-rong Tto-Tto-hol Ttae,
Hwak Deul-li-jap-Suk'?

849
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,295
- Did I get that right?
- Yes.

850
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:39,605
[They can't even follow the dialect,
let alone figure out how to decipher it!]

851
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:43,127
- I seriously have no idea what she's saying.
- I told you that this was going to be hard.

852
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:47,356
[This is like deciphering a secret code.]

853
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:50,027
I think what she said was...

854
00:56:50,028 --> 00:56:51,640
Can you say it for us one more time?

855
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:56,002
'Men-do-rong Tto-Tto-hol Ttae,
Hwak Deul-li-jap-Suk, mehrong.'

856
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:58,614
What do you think she's saying?
What is she saying?

857
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,538
- She's saying...
- This is a mission, right? You know what?

858
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:05,935
I think she's saying that we should eat
the seafood as soon as she cuts it.

859
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,356
- No, I'm not.
- No? She says no.

860
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:12,104
[Taecyeon, don't even fool yourself...]

861
00:57:12,105 --> 00:57:15,376
[It looks like dark roads are ahead
for this young man from Seoul.]

862
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:18,054
- What do you think she's saying?
- Do you understand anything I'm saying?

863
00:57:18,987 --> 00:57:21,093
Gam Soo Kwang.

864
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:31,642
[Ah... I miss my mommy.]

865
00:57:31,643 --> 00:57:34,403
- Coffee?
- She wants us to drink the coffee?

866
00:57:34,404 --> 00:57:38,122
[Could this be what she's saying?]

867
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:40,327
Don't you think that she's telling us
to drink the coffee while eating the seafood?

868
00:57:40,328 --> 00:57:43,495
While eating this?
The sea cucumber?

869
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:46,282
You're telling us to eat the sea cucumber
and drink the hot coffee along with it?

870
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:49,001
- I think that's what she's saying.
- Ma'am, is that it?

871
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:55,491
[Will Taecyeon's guess be correct in
deciphering Jeju Island dialect?]

872
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:58,187
Dip the sliced sea cucumber in the sauce,
and take a slurp of the hot coffee with it.

873
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:01,751
[Taecyeon's guess-
Dip the sea cucumber in the hot sauce.]

874
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:08,298
- Yum, that's so delicious.
[Then take a slurp of the hot coffee.]

875
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:11,527
- You got half of it correct.
- We got the half of it correct.

876
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:14,288
We got half the mission correct?

877
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:18,555
What was it?
[What did we get right, and what was wrong?]

878
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:21,898
- What was it that she said at the end?
- 'Mehrong'?

879
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:26,558
[Could that be the correct
portion of the mission?]

880
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,197
- Say the word after eating it?
- Eat the sea cucumber first.

881
00:58:29,662 --> 00:58:31,455
- And the coffee...
- Drink the coffee.

882
00:58:31,456 --> 00:58:33,899
- Drink the coffee before it gets cold.
- Drink it.

883
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,139
- Then say the word.
- Mehrong.

884
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:40,428
[Mission fail]
- Did you not stick out your tongue?

885
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:45,290
- No, I did stick out my tongue.
- You have to act it out precisely.

886
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:48,494
- We have to act it out precisely?
- Please say it for us one more time.

887
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:53,219
'Men-do-rong Tto-Tto-hol Ttae,
Hwak Deul-li-jap-Suk, mehrong.'

888
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:57,533
You have to act out only the portion
that she's telling you right now.

889
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:03,637
[We have to act out only the portion
that she's telling us to?]

890
00:59:03,638 --> 00:59:09,199
[Now that they think about it,
the sentence she spoke was very short.]

891
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,662
[Then could it mean...]
- I figured it out. I think I know what it is.

892
00:59:13,663 --> 00:59:14,968
She just wants us to drink the coffee.

893
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,850
Just drink the coffee.

894
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:20,433
[Just drink the coffee...]
- And say, mehrong.

895
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:25,688
[Could the answer be this simple?]

896
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:27,606
- That's correct.
- Yes!

897
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,355
- See? Yes, we got it!
[Jeju Island dialect mission- Success..]

898
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:33,391
We just needed to drink the coffee.
It was only about the coffee.

899
00:59:33,392 --> 00:59:39,170
- Ma'am, Jeju dialect is way too hard.
- But we understand Seoul talk very easily.

900
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:41,517
So why do you have such a hard time
with our Jeju dialect?

901
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:44,014
Ma'am, what is 'Gam Soo Kwang'?

902
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:47,586
- It means, 'Where are you going?'
- Really?

903
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,446
- So that's what it means?
- Do you know this song?

904
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:57,568
[A joyous celebration of
'Gam Soo Kwang' song.]

905
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:01,312
- See? I told you that the song exists!
- We succeeded our mission.

906
01:00:01,313 --> 01:00:04,264
- Yes, we did! Good job, Taecyeon.
- What's our ingredient?

907
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:07,785
- Drink the hot coffee and say, mehrong.
[Where do we go now to start cooking?]

908
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,544
It's another mission?

909
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:12,268
[Wait, there's another mission?]

910
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:17,643
<i>[Get your ingredients by fishing for
five silvery cutlass fish from the ocean.]</i>

911
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:21,136
Get your ingredients by fishing for
five silvery cutlass fish from the ocean...

912
01:00:21,137 --> 01:00:23,606
[On my goodness...]

913
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:27,510
[Are they kidding us right now?]

914
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:33,184
[No wonder why they fed us
the cutlass fish lunch earlier today...]

915
01:00:33,185 --> 01:00:36,891
[There were five pieces of fish
in the braised fish dish earlier...]

916
01:00:36,892 --> 01:00:40,918
[And five pieces of the grilled fish...]

917
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:46,631
[Now they're telling us to go out
and catch five fishes of our own...]

918
01:00:46,632 --> 01:00:50,809
[I thought we were going with
Jeju Island honeymoon theme...]

919
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:55,542
[But this is the real reality of life.]

920
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:01,693
[Have a great time!]

921
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:14,402
We're off to catch the cutlass fish.

922
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:19,095
We'll be back with our cutlass fish!

923
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:22,568
We're going to go and catch a lot of fish!

924
01:01:22,569 --> 01:01:26,540
[Will these two be able to safely come back
with their five cutlass fish?]

925
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:30,641
[Tai'an, China.]

926
01:01:31,505 --> 01:01:34,244
Let's go fishing for small octopus!

927
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:38,493
- Go, go!
[Suk Jin and Yoo Sun- Catch 6kg of octopus.]

928
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:42,684
- This is nice, isn't it?
- It's not bad with the nice weather.

929
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,853
This is nice.
This is much better than I had expected.

930
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,365
[Let's go out on the boat
and fish for small octopus!]

931
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:04,596
- The boat's very fast. I feel freed.
- I feel like I can really breathe.

932
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:08,215
[Throwing away all their worries and
anxieties off to the wind.]

933
01:02:08,216 --> 01:02:12,189
- And I'm here with one of my favorite actors.
[Big-nose with one of his favorite actresses.]

934
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,115
I'm being serious.

935
01:02:14,624 --> 01:02:17,995
[Both are in the best of spirits.]

936
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:22,080
- Don't worry about a thing!
- Then catch all the octopus for us.

937
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,869
I'll take care of the fishing,
so you can take care of the cooking.

938
01:02:26,961 --> 01:02:29,031
I wonder if they have any
hot sauce on the boat.

939
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:32,897
Nothing tastes better than being able to
eat your freshly caught seafood.

940
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:35,186
[Off into the depths of the ocean...]

941
01:02:35,187 --> 01:02:37,443
Okay, I think we're here.

942
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:40,865
[Finally arrives at their fishing location.]

943
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:45,983
- Just tell us what you want us to do.
- We're going to be starting off right here.

944
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:50,013
We're going to cast out the net from here,
and you're going to have to pull it back in.

945
01:02:50,014 --> 01:02:54,739
- Are the octopus under us right now?
- We'll just have to pull the net back in.

946
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,877
So all the octopus are already
caught in the net right now?

947
01:02:59,206 --> 01:03:03,717
- They're inside the seashells.
- Really? They crawl inside the seashells?

948
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:07,703
- They're already inside there?
[He's been saying they're already inside!]

949
01:03:07,738 --> 01:03:14,687
We just have to pull them out after
they've already crawled into the shells.

950
01:03:15,317 --> 01:03:18,223
- Then do we have to pull them all out?
- Do we pull them out?

951
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:20,074
Seriously?

952
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:21,756
[Pulling the octopus out of the shells
requires 100% manual labor.]

953
01:03:22,224 --> 01:03:25,176
- Are there really small octopus here?
- This spot is crawling with them.

954
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,276
- Really?
- Isn't it past the season for it?

955
01:03:27,277 --> 01:03:31,413
- No, this is actually the breeding season.
- So there are lots of the small octopus?

956
01:03:31,414 --> 01:03:34,535
- Is it going to be impressive?
- Yes, you'll see for yourself.

957
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:37,327
I'm so excited!

958
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:38,883
I'm excited!

959
01:03:38,884 --> 01:03:42,453
[We'll see you soon, small octopus.]

960
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:49,622
[Pulling up the net of seashells
that they had cast into the ocean.]

961
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:55,207
Here it comes, I see it!

962
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:58,047
[Will they really find a small
octopus inside the shell?]

963
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:05,115
[Must pull the octopus out in first try
as soon as they see it inside the shell.]

964
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:07,940
We have to check each and every one.
This one is empty.

965
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:10,156
[Time to start checking all the seashells.]

966
01:04:10,994 --> 01:04:12,674
Nothing.

967
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:18,854
[All the seashells are coming up empty...]

968
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:22,644
- Check the one that just came up.
- Which one?

969
01:04:24,344 --> 01:04:26,545
- Yes, I see it.
- I see it!

970
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:30,670
- Get the hook in there and pull it out.
[There's something inside the shell!]

971
01:04:35,617 --> 01:04:37,738
- Get out of there!
- You're really good!

972
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:39,803
Let me see.

973
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,596
It's a small octopus!

974
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:48,288
[Catches the first
small octopus of their lives.]

975
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:51,856
[Still can't believe what they're seeing.]
- Wow, I can't believe they're really here!

976
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:55,770
[A huge adrenaline rush!]

977
01:04:56,951 --> 01:04:59,394
You're really cruel.

978
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,546
Wow... hey!

979
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:05,944
[Pulls out her second small octopus.]
- You're such a brutish woman!

980
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:08,702
- Don't you even feel bad for them?
- Here's another one!

981
01:05:08,703 --> 01:05:11,312
- Pull it out.
- Get out of there!

982
01:05:11,985 --> 01:05:15,684
[Yoo Sun is onto her third catch already!]

983
01:05:15,685 --> 01:05:16,944
Why are you so cruel?

984
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:20,158
I was told that this was her first
fishing boat expedition.

985
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,859
But she was like a fisherman's daughter.
Fisherman's eldest daughter.

986
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:28,230
The daughter that goes out to catch the fish
in place of her father when he's ill or sick.

987
01:05:28,231 --> 01:05:31,468
That's the kind of power
that I saw within her.

988
