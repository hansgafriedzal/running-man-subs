102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,370

in the filling.

125

I think it'll be good.

126
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,040

combine a dish with Kimchi.

132

it seemed like a good idea.

It felt like an army's winter camp.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,650
I thought the mushrooms were
near at first.

183
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,820
The mountain wasn't too bad at first.

184

I think they couldn't record much.
Everyone was getting tired.

185
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,900
The producers were having the worst
time in Running Man history.

186

Nobody recorded us.

188

189

- They didn't even know?

193

- They never tell us.
- That's too much.

194

Ga In will cry watching this at home.

195

you're experiencing such a hardship.

on top of the mountain.]

They couldn't.

204
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,340

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,750
the New Year's cooking battle.

341
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,750
[They have the recipe and the ingredients.]
[It's all ready.]

342
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,800
[All teams report to the battlefield!]

343
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,360
[Congratulations! You are invited to
the New Year's Cooking Battle.]

344
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,540
[As last year's winner,
who do you think is your rival?]

345
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,420
Rival?
It's myself.

346
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,070
I don't really think about rivals.

347
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,920
I think my team can easily win

348
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,090
if we can show the skills we have.

349
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,570
[Next day,
'M' mall in Incheon.]

350
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,870
[From all over the nation,
and other countries.]

351
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,520
[They have gathered here.]

352
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,050
[Everything looks better
than last year.]

353
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,870
[It's the 2015 New Year's Cooking Battle.]

354
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,370
[Each team's ingredients
are set on their table.]

355
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,940
[The fresh cockles
from Bulkyo are still alive.]

356
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,040
This looks like Iron Man.

357
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,620
They were in the ocean yesterday?

358
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,320
Did you wrap them in tin foil?

359
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,420
Yoo Sun, this is phellinus linteus.

360
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,600
This is real phellinus linteus.

361
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,870
- Isn't this a broken piece of tree?
- No, it's really expensive.

362
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,900
That looks like a dried dog poo.

363
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,350
What are you talking about?
I will make some tea and give it to you.

364
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,720
[You will change your mind
when you taste it.]

365
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,000
Before we begin the cooking battle

366
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,540
I'll tell you the rules again.

367
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,970
2015 New Year's Cooking Battle.

368
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,600
Use your own ingredients and Kimchi
which is the main theme of this battle.

369
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,500
Within 100 minutes...

370
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,650
[Within 100 minutes!]

371
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,370
the team that makes the most
delicious dish will win this battle.

372
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,400
When the timer hits zero,
you can't submit the dish any more.

373
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,270
It means some teams can
be disqualified.

374
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,270
You can only open the cockles
in 100 minutes.

375
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,140
We have invited special judges
for this competition.

376
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,070
The four handsome chefs are here.

377
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,350
[Handsome?]

378
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,250
[They are as handsome as
their cooking skills.]

379
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,470
[The young chefs.]

380
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,900
[The four flower chefs, F4.]

381
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,020
[Italian chef, Nam Sung Ryul.]

382
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,850
[Professor at Seoul HOSEO Technical College,
Head Chef at 'Table Star']

383
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,720
[Chef Mr. Right in Italian cuisine.
Currently in the "O'live Show".]

384
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,900
Pasta!
Spaghetti!

385
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,650
I'm Park Sung Hoon
specializing in European cuisine.

386
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,800
[An elite chef that won the gold medal
from WorldSkills International.]

387
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,670
[Cooking shows -A Chef's Late Night Snack,
O'live show.]

388
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,870
Fusion Korean dishes are my specialty.

389
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,020
I will analyze your dishes realistically.

390
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,920
[Fusion Korean Chef, Shim Hyo Sup.]

391
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,800
[Owner chef at the Korean restaurant, 'Umui'.
CEO of cooking studio, 'Inskitchen'.]

392
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,300
[He appeared on the '100 year guest'.]

393
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,600
Hello, I cook Thai cuisine...

394
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,420
Thailand!

395
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,620
[Thai Cuisine Chef, Heo Hyuk Koo.]

396
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
[A star chef who is
in the middle of Thai fever.]

397
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,350
He's nice.

398
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,950
The dish has to be delicious.
I will focus on the taste.

399
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,750
Don't focus on the decoration.

400
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,050
That's what my team seeks in food.

401
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,150
I want to focus on creativity

402
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,070
rather than techniques and preparations.

403
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,620
That's our motto.
We're going to focus on creativity.

404
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,920
I want to see the popular appeal.

405
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,850
That's right.
We're all for the popularity!

406
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,670
How can phellinus linteus be popular?

407
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,450
Just keep quiet!

408
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,500
[Jae Suk, it's embarrassing.]

409
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,420
- Do you like S.E.S.?
- I like S.E.S.

410
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,620
[They're sucking up.]

411
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,500
The chefs will now go back to
their seats and judge the dishes.

412
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,870
See you soon!
We will see you with a good dish!

413
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,870
- There are five kinds of Kimchi.
[Old fermented Kimchi]

414
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,950
[Radish Kimchi], [White Kimchi]

415
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,100
[Whole cabbage Kimchi],
[Young radish Kimchi].

416
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,900
[Five kinds of Kimchi.]

417
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,320
Two teams per Kimchi will be accepted.

418
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,050
Who gets to choose first will be
decided by rock-paper-scissors.

419
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,570
One person from each team
come forward.

420
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,550
[Each team's thinking of a
certain kind of Kimchi.]

421
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,100
It's too much pressure.

422
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,850
You're the main chef of our team.

423
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,450
What do we need?

424
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,450
First, Old fermented Kimchi
and second, whole cabbage Kimchi.

425
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,550
Old fermented Kimchi is the first?

426
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,570
Old fermented Kimchi,
I want Old fermented Kimchi.

427
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,350
Old fermented Kimchi is
the best for stews or soups.

428
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,050
Old fermented Kimchi.

429
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,000
I think we need Old fermented Kimchi.

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,170
- I've interviewed five people.
- Do they all want the same one?

431
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,450
I guess that's what we like the most.

432
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,450
- What if you can't pick that one?
- Pardon?

433
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,750
No way!
Then we can't make our dish!

434
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,150
Then we'll fail.
Just like that!

435
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,020
[He's scared thinking about it.]

436
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,970
Then we'll start rock-paper-scissors.
I'll ask what you're going to play.

437
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,450
[Can't you see what's going on?]

438
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,970
Are you from the women association?

439
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,270
Ladies are participating
at a Kimchi making event?

440
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,100
[Three of them are married.]

441
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,420
[I'm not even married.]

442
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,070
Are you ready?

443
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,150
Rock-paper-scissors!

444
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,170
[Fei is the last one to pick.]

445
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,650
[Second round.]
Rock-paper-scissors!

446
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,550
Rock-paper-scissors!
Rock-paper-scissors!

447
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,000
Wait a moment.
I understand you're in a hurry.

448
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,600
I should call for the game.
Rock-paper-scissors!

449
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,450
[Sung Ryung and Seo Woo lose.]

450
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,240
Rock-paper-scissors!

451
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:49,440
[Yoo Sun and Shoo get to pick first.]

452
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,140
Old fermented Kimchi!
Old fermented Kimchi!

453
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,270
[Suk Jin and Yoo Sun pick
Old fermented Kimchi.]

454
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,000
[Ha Ha and Shoo
also pick Old fermented Kimchi.]

455
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,070
- Old fermented Kimchi is sold out.
- The liquid is crucial for them.

456
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,320
[The rest can't pick Old fermented Kimchi
from now on.]

457
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,640
[Jae Suk and Jung Hoon
pick Whole Cabbage Kimchi.]

458
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,740
[Ji Hyo and Taecyeon pick
Radish Kimchi.]

459
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,240
[Gary and Sung Ryung pick white Kimchi.]

460
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:30,370
- Should we pick white Kimchi?
[Seo Woo picks whole cabbage Kimchi.]

461
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,850
[Kwang Soo and Fei are left
with the White Kimchi.]

462
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,970
[Kimchi selection is over.]

463
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,670
The cooking will begin now!

464
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,250
[100 minutes are given.]

465
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,070
Let's go for it!

466
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,150
- Let's have a fighting spirit!
- Fighting!

467
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,470
I'm nervous!

468
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,600
Let's go with it, Jung Hoon!
We might win this battle!

469
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,340
[Who will win the battle?]

470
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:15,840
I want to make something
that no one can think of.

471
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,440
I think Ha Ha can follow my lead.

472
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,540
One of the strong candidates is Fei.

473
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,620
Fei is really good at cooking.

474
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,700
I've tasted a dish she made
on a show I'm hosting.

475
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
She's really good.

476
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,640
She was on a competitive cooking show.

477
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,340
Indeed, it's Fei.

478
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,700
Fei's team.

479
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,600
It's not fair! We're amateurs
and she's a professional.

480
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,270
[Kwang Soo and Fei are
in the highest level of alert.]

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,850
[Her cutting technique is amazing.]

482
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,640
You're really good with knives.

483
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,120
Am I?

484
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,900
[She's good at handling cleavers.]

485
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,150
[See-saw motion, what a cutting technique!]

486
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,920
[You are now watching Running Man.]
(Not a cooking show.)

487
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,870
[What kind of dish will she make?]

488
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,450
I think Suk Jin and Yoo Sun
are my rivals.

489
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,670
I heard Yoo Sun is really
good at cooking.

490
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,700
Sung Ryung's face changed

491
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,140
when she heard Yoo Sun is
participating.

492
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,520
She suddenly said 'Let's not win.'

493
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,000
'Let's just enjoy the show',
when the cameras weren't around.

494
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,770
[A dark horse who psychs out Sung Ryung.]

495
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,650
- Did you catch them?
- Yes, we caught them.

496
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,820
[She cleans them with flour?]

497
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,650
- You're not scared?
- We caught them.

498
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,170
- You're really not scared?
- Why should I be scared?

499
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,370
[Rub with flour to
thoroughly clean the octopus.]

500
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,350
We'll make pasta with the small octopus.

501
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,850
We harvested some Jerusalem artichokes
for two and a half hours yesterday.

502
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,370
We'll make Jerusalem artichoke
salad dressing.

503
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,820
We've suddenly decided it yesterday.

504
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,520
We put it in a blender with
milk and honey.

505
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,950
Yoo Sun suggested that
we should make a salad dressing.

506
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,420
The dressing is so good.
I want to let the world know.

507
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,840
Did we actually make this?

508
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,800
- This is really good, isn't it?
- It is.

509
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,120
[Jerusalem artichoke is high in inulin,
which mimics insulin.]

510
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,440
- What is it?
- I'm going to make the dressing first.

511
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,570
<i>- Let's trade Kimchi!
- You can't trade Kimchi!</i>

512
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,140
- It's really good!
- It's good?

513
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,940
We grated the fresh Jerusalem artichoke
and it was nutty.

514
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,450
I thought I can add some perilla powder
to make it more nutty.

515
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,570
And make a salad dressing.

516
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,440
It's the best.
I never thought it'd be this good.

517
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,820
[Suk Jin and Yoo Sun finish
making the dressing.]

518
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,040
[Jae Suk and Jung Hoon]

519
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,050
The buckwheat that
great Jang Geum gave us.

520
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,500
Should we make four servings?
Two dumplings per person...

521
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,900
then we need eight dumplings.

522
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,020
- Will this be enough?
- Yes, it looks good.

523
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,040
Did you discuss it with Han Ga In?

524
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,650
I told her everything.

525
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:46,640
My wife was asking my mother-in-law
on the phone.

526
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,040
Later, we decided to create
a pure and clean dish

527
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,540
to keep the original form
of porridge soup.

528
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,840
Besides the porridge soup

529
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,040
we will serve phellinus linteus tea.

530
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,940
I think we can get some
additional points for it.

531
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,850
[Making the phellinus linteus tea
with jujubes.]

532
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,640
Don't we need to add more jujubes?

533
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,870
No, it's enough.

534
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:17,170
- Have you made jujube tea before?
- I always make it at home.

535
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,440
Your family lives in harmony.

536
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:26,450
Your family makes tea
and dumplings together.

537
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,540
- I'm going to make Pad Thai.
[Pad Thai and Tom Yum Goong.]

538
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:37,250
I will soak the rice noodles
in water for about 25 minutes.

539
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,240
[Making the broth for Tom Yum Goong.
With palm sugar, mushrooms and coriander.]

540
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,870
[Add prawns and hot pepper paste.]

541
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,840
[Coconut milk]

542
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,640
[and lime juice.]

543
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,250
[She put everything in the recipe...]

544
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,250
Can I taste it?

545
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,900
Wait! Wait!

546
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,700
It's not like you're making
some bean paste stew!

547
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,100
Sung Ryung!

548
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,320
I didn't know that she was stubborn.

549
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,540
I want to make Tom Yum Goong again

550
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:33,140
but I think she wants to
fix it and submit it.

551
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,750
Win or lose this battle,
I will try making a delicious dish.

552
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,670
[Is this White Kimchi?]

553
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,650
[Today's theme, Kimchi
is being used for the first time.]

554
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,540
[She cuts White Kimchi
and puts in Tom Yum Goong.]

555
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,270
[Is the taste better than before?]

556
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,140
It's good!

557
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,070
We can cook it a little longer.

558
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,120
[Gary and Sung Ryung revived
thanks to the white Kimchi.]

559
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,140
- Wash the cockles in salted water.
- Okay.

560
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,440
[Washing cockles in salted water
to remove the mud.]

561
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,200
[Washing big fan-mussels.]

562
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,450
Fire!
Fire!

563
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,600
Are you allowed to have
things like that?

564
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,840
- What is it?
- What is it?

565
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,950
Why did you bring table tennis paddles?

566
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,740
- Because I thought I'll be bored.
- Why did you bring them

567
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,040
Where did you bring them?
Are you going to use abalone, too?

568
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,740
Of course!

569
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm going to make another healthy dish.

570
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:52,870
We'll make some shiitake cakes
and spicy cockles.

571
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,100
We'll also make cockle bibimbop

572
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,750
and cockle stuffed cucumber. So we
can make several dishes using cockles.

573
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,850
We have a hidden card,
but you'll see it later.

574
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,240
[You still have another dish to make?]

575
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,820
Cockles are cooked.

576
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:17,140
It's a lot of work.
Cockles are a lot like you.

577
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,340
[Cockles and Seo Woo.]

578
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,140
Am I now Cockle Seo Woo?

579
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,640
- Did you prepare Kimchi?
- Let's rinse the Kimchi.

580
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,140
[Kkuk opens the cockles
and wash them one by one.]

581
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,000
You're taking too much time.

582
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,300
- Open them all and then wash it!
- Okay, I will.

583
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,020
I need to... move away!
Go do it somewhere else.

584
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,200
- Where?
- On the floor.

585
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,540
[It looks somewhat familiar.]

586
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,320
[Until the moment...]

587
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,540
[Jong Kook scolded Seo Woo.]
- What are you doing, Seo Woo?

588
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,650
Girls from Seoul are a handful.
Your persona is 'burden' from now on.

589
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,050
- You're a burden.
[Kkuk didn't know...]

590
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,700
[that he would be the 'burden'.]

591
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:16,100
[He's getting scolded at the corner.]
- Just open them all and then wash them.

592
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,320
It'll take too long to wash it one by one.
Now I'm nagging.

593
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,500
[Kkuk is acting like a new bride.]

594
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,850
[Yawning?]

595
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,070
[Taecyeon tries to cut the fish.]

596
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,650
[He ruins his image
as a masculine idol.]

597
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,750
[He is sawing, not cutting.]

598
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,170
[Ji Hyo is busy making the sauce.]
- Hot pepper flakes.

599
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,040
[Adding cooking wine and yuzu citron.]

600
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,870
[She puts everything that she sees.]

601
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,520
[And she tastes it.]

602
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,340
It's the second time
I've made any kind of sauce.

603
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,270
I was only focused on the sauce.

604
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:07,070
Taecyeon is working in his own space,
and I'm working in my space.

605
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,150
I don't know how he's doing now.

606
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,920
[Taecyeon tastes Blank Ji's sauce, too.]

607
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,520
- Did you put some garlic?
- Yes.

608
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,750
Garlic...
Do I need to put some more?

609
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,170
- I don't know what I need to add.
[Please don't add anything more, Ji Hyo.]

610
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,600
We're going to be the winners
at this pace.

611
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,240
We would have failed if we
didn't get the Old Fermented Kimchi.

612
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,740
[Finally, the Old fermented Kimchi
is released.]

613
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,570
It's really good!
I'm not lying!

614
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,040
You will go mad if you eat this.

615
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:49,740
[Stir-fry the pork forelegs marinated
in curry sauce with Kimchi and vegetables.]

616
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,850
Please help us, Old Fermented Kimchi!

617
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,020
[They've only started cooking.]

618
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,620
[40 minutes passed.]

619
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,600
[Ji Hyo and Taecyeon replace
radish with radish Kimchi.]

620
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Braised radish Kimchi is a lot better
than braised radish.

621
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,700
I think Ji Hyo and Taecyeon
will make a very good dish.

622
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,100
[Kwang Soo and Fei
start to prepare white Kimchi.]

623
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,000

624
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,620
[Fillings for dim sum:
Stir-fry chopped pork and vegetables.]

625
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,000
[Jae Suk and Jung Hoon
use the Whole cabbage Kimchi.]

626
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,340
Their Kimchi is not fermented.

627
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,050
You can add some vinegar
when you cook unfermented Kimchi.

628
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:03,570
[Kimchi porridge soup:
Stir-fry Kimchi with beef and garlic.]

629
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,820
[Add water and bring to a boil.]

630
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,050
[Jong Kook and Seo Woo
prepare their kimchi, too.]

631
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,450
[Seo Woo's knife technique
is as good as Fei's.]

632
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,070
[She puts kimchi into the hidden dish.]

633
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,220
[Kkuk is still struggling with cockles.]

634
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,000
I can't believe you're
still doing that!

635
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,850
It isn't as easy as it looks.

636
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,150
I'm getting upset. I guess there's
a reason I play a bad woman.

637
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,940
[Kimchi shiitake mushroom cake:
Coat mushrooms with cornstarch.]

638
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,370
[Stuffing the mushroom with diced
kimchi, pancake mix, and vegetables...]

639
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,090
[Gary and Sung Ryung start
to make their pad thai.]

640
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,170
Yes, Chef.

641
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:55,710
- Let's add three.
[Cook all the ingredients together in a pan.]

642
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,980
- Add the noodles.
- We need some sugar.

643
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,310
[A perfect harmony of the ingredients.]
- We need the fish sauce.

644
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,760
- What else do you have? Add it!
[Perfect teamwork.]

645
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,590
- Do we have a dish to put this in?
[Flips the hot sautè pan around.]

646
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,880
[And within minutes, pad thai is ready!]

647
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,720
- Kim Sung Ryung, you're disqualified.
- Why?

648
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,440
[Who do you think you are?]

649
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,960
What do you mean, why?

650
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,780
Why am I disqualified?
I'm working so hard.

651
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,940
What are you guys doing
over here?

652
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,520
Didn't I tell you that you'd waste
all your time shucking those cockles?

653
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,420
There's a tool for shucking these cockles,
but we didn't bring it with us.

654
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,910
Shucking those cockles isn't easy.

655
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,050
[Jae Suk heads over to heckle
Suk Jin and Yoo Sun this time.]

656
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,680
You're lucky with your home at home,
and you're lucky with your partner here.

657
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,200
- Yoo Sun, you look like quite the cook.
- I told you that I'm good.

658
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,070
Why do you always add in the shoulder
shrug instead of just saying the words?

659
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,450
- Yoo Sun always does that.
- We always laugh about it.

660
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,680
[Half the competition is already over.]

661
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,860
[Kwang Soo has been mixing the same
bowl of dough for the past 50 minutes.]

662
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,650
[Looking more and more at a loss.]

663
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,580
[But thinking back...]

664
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,030
[Kwang Soo already has a deep past
with making the flour dough mixture.]

665
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:37,130
[I'm so sick and tired...
of these flour dough mixtures.]

666
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,350
- No, I don't think that's right.
- Just trust me, Fei.

667
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,250
- What am I going to do with that?
[A dangerous situation with the dough.]

668
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,020
- I think we have to start over.
- No, we don't.

669
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,330
[In the end, Fei steps in
to help save the situation.]

670
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,200
[I vow to save this dough mixture myself.]

671
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,730
[With a mixture of a soft and firm touch...]

672
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,740
[Dough mixture with the chef's
heart and soul mixed in it.]

673
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,360
Why are you able to do it, and I'm not?
I think that's enough to help us win.

674
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,630
I think that's more than enough.

675
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,850
[The dough is saved!]
- Okay, I can handle it from here.

676
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,070
- No, don't do it.
- What do you mean, don't do it?

677
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,150
What do you mean by that?
Fei, that's so disappointing to hear.

678
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,380
Don't do anything and just
cheer me on from the sidelines.

679
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,570
I have a very clear picture now.

680
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,050
Flour dough and I don't go together.

681
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,630
Flour dough isn't my style of cooking.

682
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:44,920
Kwang Soo keeps giving me his opinion,
but I keep telling him that he's wrong.

683
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,800
I think he's putting a lot
of his faith in me.

684
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,870
[Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Taecyeon are busy
prepping their cuttlefish dish.]

685
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,350
[Gets rid of the fishiness by dipping
the fish in the curry mixture.]

686
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,710
[Their secret weapon is out!
Charcoal grill is fanned to a flame.]

687
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:07,230
[Even the panel of judges seems
impressed by their move.]

688
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,350
But I really would prefer that they don't
grill the curry coated fish on the grill.

689
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,660
I have a feeling that it's going to burn up
like the way my heart is burning up right now.

690
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,970
[The cuttlefish is burning up
just like the judge had predicted.]

691
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:29,310
- It's okay, everything is going to be fine.
[Sings a song to comfort himself.]

692
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,590
It's a total failure.

693
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,890
[The two of the lesser burnt pieces.]

694
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,490
I don't think this piece is going to do.

695
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,010
[How is he going to rectify this
emergency cuttlefish situation?]

696
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,350
[And that's none other than
by decorating the dish!]

697
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,330
[With an impromptu sauce piping bag.]

698
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,390
[Decorates the dish with
the prepared citron sauce.]

699
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,720
[But even his attempt at decorating
the dish is a failure.]

700
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,220
Maybe I should've used
a smaller spoon.

701
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,990
[Taecyeon makes another attempt by
transferring the fish to a smaller dish.]

702
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,240
Okay, I'm going to make another attempt
with a smaller spoon this time.

703
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,950
[With all his hopes in the small spoon...]

704
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,970
[Fails again! Guess the size
of the spoon wasn't the issue.]

705
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:42,420
[Puts his heart and soul into the dish, and
finishes with a sprinkle of the sesame seeds.]

706
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,920
[Jae Suk and Jung Hoon are busy
cooking up their pot of kimchi noodles.]

707
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,380
[Add in the soaked buckwheat rice to the pot
of already cooked kimchi, meat and veggies.]

708
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,330
[It's time to add in the dumplings.]

709
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,900
They're all stuck together.

710
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:10,320
[All the dumplings are stuck together
in one huge lump of a mess.]

711
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:16,340
- I can't believe this is happening.
- I think I've got this one.

712
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,570
[What are you going to do with that?]

713
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,900
[Dumps in the whole mess into the pot.]

714
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,690
[Gives up on maintaining
the shape of the dumplings.]

715
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,340
- Why is there so much of it?
[There's enough for the entire staff!]

716
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,930
[Meanwhile, Suk Jin and Yoo Sun are...]

717
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,750
[Their own dish creation of stuffing
the octopus head with the filling.]

718
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,140
- I really think this is going to be amazing.
- Let's cook it a little bit longer.

719
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,410
[Stir-fry the kimchi stuffed heads
in the heated pan.]

720
00:47:53,410 --> 00:48:00,580
[Create a tomato based sauce with minced
fermented kimchi, onions, garlic, and bacon.]

721
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,890
Maybe we should've used smaller heads
to stuff these in.

722
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,690
- There are only 30 minutes left.
- I know, we don't have much time.

723
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:14,150
- Only 30 minutes left on the clock!
- 30 minutes?

724
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,110
Jung Hoon, there are 30 minutes
left on the clock.

725
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,720
- Do you think 30 minutes is enough?
- It just needs to come to a boil.

726
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,590
- Then it just needs to simmer for a bit.
- But what is the dish?

727
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,800
[With only 30 minutes left on the clock,
they're trying to figure out what it is?]

728
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,670
- It's porridge.
- Porridge? I see...

729
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:39,000
- But it's North Korean style.
- It is?

730
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,930
- My father really likes this dish.
- He does?

731
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,290
He'd always eat this as a
hangover cure

732
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,270
- and I remember eating it as a kid.
- This soup dish?

733
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,950
[Tries their secret weapon,
mushroom and jujube water.]

734
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,680
[Even offers a taste to the camera man.]

735
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,900
Come on, just try it.

736
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,490
- That's pretty good.
- Not bad, is it?

737
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,810
Drink this, and go for a second kid.

738
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,420
- At my age?
- What's wrong with your age?

739
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,900
I'm telling you that this mushroom tonic is
going to bring you the magic for another kid.

740
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,320
- Okay, then leave some for me.
- That's what I'm talking about!

741
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,040
[Will this magical elixir win
the panel of judges over, too?]

742
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,300
We'll just feel it all out.
Okay, let's do this!

743
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,880
He has a mortar in his hand.
They call those 'Mortar and pestle'.

744
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:38,560
People in Taiwan uses it to mince garlic,
spices or such when they're cooking.

745
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:42,930
- That's a real and authentic mortar.
- He's doing it up right.

746
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,700
[Crush the dried shrimp, peppers, garlic
in the mortar and add in the sugar...]

747
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,050
[and season it with fish sauce, then mix it
together with papaya and kimchi with lime.]

748
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,220
Yes, I think that's enough.

749
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,640
- Okay!
- Let's add in the papaya!

750
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,000
[Automatically starts clapping
in the midst of all their excitement.]

751
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,800
- Time to crush it together.
- Let's start singing.

752
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,210
[Gary and Sung Ryung are
totally in sync as a team.]

753
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,180
- Okay!
- Okay!

754
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,500
[Even their second dish is now complete.]

755
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,670
[Wow, that's good!]
- It's good with the lime, isn't it?

756
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,300
- I don't think it needs anything else.
- Right?

757
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,130
[Jong Kook and Seo Woo
on the other hand...]

758
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,770
[Seo Woo has five different dishes
going all at the same time.]

759
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:45,970
[Top slices of cucumbers with
steamed cockles and seasoned soy sauce.]

760
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,090
[And their secret main dish.]

761
00:50:54,090 --> 00:51:01,660
[A mix of abalone, octopus, and other seafood
in a pot of broth with fragrant veggies.]

762
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,100
- What is this?
- It's our seafood stew.

763
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,880
By any chance... you're not here
to interfere with our cooking, are you?

764
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,690
I really was a huge fan of yours
in the drama, 'Heirs'.

765
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,530
- Thank you.
- She's so cool.

766
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,180
- She's cool, she still goes clubbing.
[Even Mr. Capable is impressed by Sung Ryung.]

767
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,120
- I don't go clubbing.
- Want to go with me some time?

768
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,450
- She's seriously so cool.
- Okay, it's a deal.

769
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,260
[Kwang Soo and Fei are getting serious
about cooking their dishes.]

770
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:40,390
[Stir-fries the cold rice with egg.]

771
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:43,650
Kwang Soo, we have to be quick
and not let it overcook.

772
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,360
[In the meantime, Kwang Soo
gets the dim sum ready.]

773
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,020
[Fei adds in her own special seasoning.]
- That's your own seasoning, isn't it?

774
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,990
This is how you actually cook at home?

775
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:07,630
[Adds minced chicken, vegetables,
kimchi and seasoning to the rice mix.]

776
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,560
[Will the Chinese seasoning mix well
with Korean kimchi?]

777
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,040
We're going to make shrimp chips
with the dough.

778
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,540
Ha Ha...

779
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,910
Okay, this is frying up nicely.

780
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:31,270
[Fries up the dumpling dough
and sprinkle it with the shrimp powder.]

781
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:40,780
- We're going to fry it until golden brown.
[Makes a topping with the minced kimchi.]

782
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,890
[Their hands starts to move faster
as the clock continues to tick.]

783
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:50,490
[Create your best dish for the chance
at becoming the top chef.]

784
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,450
[Everything is hanging on the line!]

785
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,250
Only ten minutes left on the clock!

786
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:04,380
[All the dishes must be completed
within the next ten minutes!]

787
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,420
[Kwang Soo and Fei are
feeling the pressure.]

788
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,330
[In the midst of all this chaos,
Fei starts to cook the egg drop soup!]

789
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:17,330
- I've never cooked like this before.
- Fei, you're really impressing me right now.

790
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,490
We're definitely going to win this.

791
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,520
It's hot, so be careful.

792
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,700
[Jong Kook and Seo Woo are putting
finishing touches to their final dish.]

793
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,730
- How does it taste?
- It's good.

794
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,080
[The perfect amount of seasoning.]

795
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,450
It's not even salty.
I like that it's not salty.

796
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:36,580
[Add the steamed cockles into the mixture
of sauce and fresh vegetables.]

797
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,760
- Where's the shucked cockles?
- Over here.

798
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,250
[Gary and Sung Ryung even have
a dessert dish to present.]

799
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,950
Are you grilling up the meat?

800
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,520
[Jae Suk and Sung Hoon are grilling the meat
as an accompaniment to the noodle soup.]

801
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,580
We don't need too much of it.

802
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,530
[Ha Ha and Shoo are juicing up the carrots
that they've harvested themselves.]

803
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,060
[While each team are busy preparing
their secret ingredient dish...]

804
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,170
[Yoo Sun is now adding in the pasta
to keep it from getting too soggy.]

805
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,780
[Even twists up the pasta like a pro.]

806
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,980
[And finishes up the dish
with the stuffed octopus heads.]

807
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,160
[Doesn't even forget to add
the potato dressing to the octopus salad.]

808
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,160
[Ji Hyo and Taecyeon even have a refreshing
shikhye to go along with their dish.]

809
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,410
- Okay, we're all set.
- I'll take it over to the table.

810
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,700
Fei, we've ruined this one, too.

811
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,660
[Fei calmly plates the fried rice
in the midst of all this chaos.]

812
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,210
- We're in trouble.
- No, we're fine.

813
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:12,430
- One minute!
- No, just plate it.

814
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,230
[One minute left!]

815
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,990
[The time is almost up!]

816
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,710
- Jong Kook, take this out there.
- Is it ready?

817
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:35,240
[With all their hearts and soul in the dish,
they're taken out to the judging table.]

818
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,990
Okay, the dishes are on the table.

819
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,060
[The judging will begin in the order
the dishes are placed on the table.]

820
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,590
Are we done?

821
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,670
- Ha Ha!
- It's already on the table.

822
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:57,110
- Where do we need to take this?
- Let's go!

823
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,180
[Disqualified from the judging
once they miss the time limit.]

824
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,820
Get it on the plate.
Ouch, that's hot!

825
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,040
That's so hot!

826
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,940
No, just get it on the table!

827
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,780
- Four!
- Here it is!

828
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,790
[2015 Cooking Battle is now over.]

829
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:37,380
[From every corner of Korea...
and even from Hong Kong and Thailand...]

830
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,030
[Dishes with the hearts and souls
of these seven teams.]

831
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:50,470
[Just who will take home the victory
from the 2015 Cooking Battle?]

832
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,300
- All the dishes are now complete.
- Yes.

833
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,790
Panel of judges, please come out.

834
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:05,200
[Which of these dishes will win the hearts
of this beautiful panel of judges?]

835
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,200
Each team will now step forward
and introduce their dishes

836
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,920
and the panel of judges
will judge their dishes.

837
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,530
First up, we have Taecyeon and Ji Hyo.

838
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,330
[First dish- Taecyeon and Ji Hyo.]

839
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,940
Can you please tell us about your dish?

840
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,350
We traveled to Jeju Island for our dish.

841
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:29,530
We were actually at a loss as to how we were
going to combine these two flavors together

842
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:34,820
but when we saw radish kimchi on the table,
with the harmony of radish in the dish

843
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,130
we cooked the fish with radish kimchi
to bring out the flavors together.

844
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,570
Then let's try the dish.

845
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,210
[Time to test it out.]
- Why do I feel so nervous?

846
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,690
I feel more nervous than
I did last year.

847
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,070
I really hope that you enjoy it.

848
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,930
[How is the joint flavor of
radish kimchi with the cuttlefish?]

849
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:57,090
I'm curious to see how the cuttlefish
would taste with the radish kimchi.

850
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,360
I'm sure that it'll just
taste like radish kimchi.

851
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:06,490
[Will it just taste like plain radish kimchi,
or will it be a match made in heaven?]

852
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,560
- They don't seem to look too happy.
- They should be commenting on it by now.

853
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,030
[How will the panel of judges
rate Ji Hyo and Taecyeon's dish?]

854
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,380
First, the dish is very...

855
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,670
- First, the dish is very...
[The dice has been rolled.]

856
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,140
[How will he rate the dish?]

857
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,060
The cuttlefish is so fresh, and
the flesh is so delicate and delicious.

858
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:38,210
But I can't help but think that the
radish kimchi may be too unfermented.

859
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:42,660
I think the cuttlefish itself may be
some of the best I've had

860
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:51,000
but I can't quite figure out what you were
trying to do with the radish kimchi in the dish.

861
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I agree with your comment.

862
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,220
- But thank you for your hard efforts.
- Thank you.

863
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,400
[Ji Hyo and Taecyeon's judging is complete.]

864
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,160
[- Cuttlefish itself is outstanding.
- But it's a wrong combination of the two.]

865
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,630
[Huh?]

866
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:15,340
[Second dish- Jae Suk and Jung Hoon.]

867
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,420
First, our dish is...

868
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,300
[Is this supposed to be a joke?]
- I see that our panel of judges...

869
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,130
I see that they can't contain
the laughter on their faces.

870
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,830
This isn't just a joke,
but this really is your dish, right?

871
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:32,110
[A bowl of mixed porridge?]
- I'm really sorry that you're disappointed.

872
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:38,040
- But Jung Hoon's father is from North...
- No, he's from Gangwon-do.

873
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,630
- I mean, he's from Gangwon-do.
- Did you say he's from the North?

874
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:49,420
His father originates from Gangwon-do,
but whenever he'd have too much to drink...

875
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,420
- Why don't you explain it to them?
- Let me explain it for you.

876
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:59,650
When Jae Suk and I went to Gangwon-do,
we learned how to make buckwheat noodles.

877
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:04,390
We took that concept and added kimchi to it.
And as for the tea

878
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:09,360
we went into the mountains ourselves
to find the Phellinus mushrooms.

879
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,290
- Yes, we harvested the mushrooms ourselves.
- Then we simmered it with jujubes.

880
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,710
- We've brewed the tea ourselves.
- What do you think of your situation?

881
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,940
This is the worst case scenario.

882
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,320
We're in critical danger right now.

883
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:27,550
But you may have a change of heart
once you taste the dish.

884
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,580
The dish was sitting out too long.

885
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,900
[Will the dish taste
as surprising as it looks?]

886
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,800
- Are there dumplings in this dish?
- Yes, I taste the dumplings.

887
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,420
- His father really loves dumplings.
- What's the correlation with kimchi in this?

888
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,620
It's kimchi dumplings.

889
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,030
[Okay, I see...]
- It's kimchi dumplings.

890
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:51,410
We didn't add any other seasonings,
but relied on the filling of the dumplings

891
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,240
to season the dish as a whole.

892
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,170
- I actually kind of like it.
- You like it?

893
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,720
- I think it's actually kind of good.
- That's so great to hear!

894
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,380
I like the flavors of kimchi in the dish.

895
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,460
What's going on here?

896
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,830
[Everyone's flustered at the sudden
twist of events.]

897
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:16,220
- You should try the tea, too.
- I really enjoy the tea that you've brewed.

898
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,950
We hiked through the mountains for two hours
to find and harvest those mushrooms.

899
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,370
- I really enjoy the tea.
- Thank you.

900
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,510
[The unexpected deep flavors from
the kimchi and the buckwheat noodles.]

901
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,520
[All the judges are impressed with
the flavors of the brewed tea.]

902
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,020
We sustained some injuries from
the cockle digging we did yesterday.

903
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,970
- My hand, especially.
- How did you hurt your hand?

904
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,770
- I had to cook five dishes.
- Yes, she took on a lot of work.

905
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,640
I was watching from the sidelines,
and it was from her own carelessness.

906
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,660
I like the cleanliness and
the simplicity of these dishes.

907
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,790
[A five course cockle and kimchi spread.]

908
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,180
Even from a quick glance,
I can see the harmony of the dishes.

909
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:08,260
- The first dish we have for you is...
- Healthy cockle stew.

910
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,830
[Main dish of the spread-
Healthy cockle stew.]

911
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:14,970
- As for the Bibimbap...
- Mix all the ingredients together.

912
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:22,110
Then the cucumber slices are topped with
cockle and seasoning as a small dish concept.

913
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:26,960
Then the portabellas were stuffed with
chewy cockles and grilled to perfection.

914
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,290
- Have you ever studied cooking before?
- I used to have a roommate...

915
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:36,540
- I had a girl roommate for a brief while.
- Are you sure that it was a girl?

916
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,170
- Are you sure that it was a girl?
[Is that supposed to be a joke right now?]

917
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,290
- Are you sure that it was a girl?
- We'll assume that it was a girl.

918
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,650
[The questions about the identity
of her 'roommate' are flying in.]

919
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,160
We'll start trying the dishes.

920
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,130
[Time to taste all the dishes.]

921
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:56,920
[Will the dishes taste as good
as they look?]

922
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,980
- They're saying that it's good.
- Really?

923
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,940
- Grilled mushrooms are delicious.
- The sauce is excellent.

924
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,680
- It's grilled to perfection.
- Thank you.

925
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,390
[A shower of compliments.]

926
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,830
In addition, I don't live
with my roommate anymore

927
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,240
and I'm now living by myself.

928
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,010
- Why are you telling them that?
- If you're ever in the area...

929
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:22,670
My phone number is, 010...

930
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,740
[Please look kindly upon us.]

931
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,510
- You don't need to do that!
- Don't be persuaded by her charms!

932
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,920
- You're going too far.
- I'm just trying to win us some points.

933
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,970
[The panel of judges are
very focused on tasting the dishes.]

934
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,150
Bibimbap is the highlight of our course.

935
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,950
The combination of the Bibimbap
with the accompanying soup...

936
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:46,710
- I cleaned all the octopus myself.
- Yes, she's very impressive.

937
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,080
Eating too much now
is going to ruin your appetite.

938
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,870
- Please take just one small bite.
- All the dishes go together.

939
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:03,240
- I would pay money to eat these dishes.
- I agree.

940
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,770
If you're ever in the area...

941
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,370
[Han-Nam-Dong's beauty Chef, Seo Woo.]

942
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,330
The level of these dishes...
I really am quite impressed.

943
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,370
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you both for all your hard efforts.

944
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,690
[First strong candidates for the win?]

945
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:30,070
[- A match made in heaven combination.
- No negative comments to even think of.]

946
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:33,500
[Fourth dish- Suk Jin and Yoo Sun.]

947
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:36,140
I'm actually very eager to
try out your dish.

948
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,770
We actually used a lot of
Jerusalem artichokes in our dishes.

949
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:46,250
We harvested the artichokes ourselves to
ensure the freshness of our ingredients.

950
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,300
Even the salad dressing was made
out of the Jerusalem artichokes.

951
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,870
Jerusalem dress... I mean, the dressing...
No, the artichokes were ground up...

952
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:55,240
He has no idea what he's saying.

953
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,010
What do you mean,
Jerusalem artichokes dress?

954
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,670
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm sorry.

955
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,160
[Is he going to get himself
a balsamic dress next?]

956
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,310
Freshen up your palate
with the salad and the dressing.

957
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,480
The dressing was made of
freshly pureed Jerusalem artichokes.

958
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:17,720
We added some sesame seeds to bring out
the nuttiness in the flavor

959
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,220
for the completion of the salad.

960
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,800
Then our pasta dish is a
baby octopus-kimchi pasta.

961
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,920
The fermented radish's flavor is enhanced
when you stir-fry it in the pan

962
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,070
so we added the tomato sauce after
the radish has already been stir-fried.

963
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,520
- She sounds like a cooking instructor.
- She sounds very professional.

964
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:38,810
Since kimchi is added in the dish,
instead of using Italian arugula

965
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,400
we used kketnip instead to bring out
the Korean flavors of the dish.

966
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,230
Why didn't you tell me about that?
You should've told me about the arugula.

967
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,250
Anyway, we topped off the dish
with ribbons of kketnip.

968
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:52,210
I think using baby octopus
and Jerusalem artichokes together

969
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,860
while they're both in season
was a great choice.

970
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:59,020
[Time to taste the dishes.]

971
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:04,080
You should try the stuffed
head portion, too.

972
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:10,610
[Chef Big-nose offers up his service to
cut the stuffed head pieces for the judges.]

973
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:12,380
Okay, give it a try.

974
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:16,700
- The texture of these are great.
- We caught them from the ocean ourselves.

975
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,770
- The kketnip is a great combination.
- Thank you.

976
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,680
- We didn't use the ddong-kula.
- It's not ddong-kula!

977
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,210
What kind of a thing is that
to be saying during a meal?

978
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,990
- They're eating right now.
- Give the Jerusalem artichoke juice a try.

979
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:34,710
[Their secret weapon-
Jerusalem artichoke juice.]

980
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,850
- It tastes similar to the mushroom tea.
- Really?

981
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,800
Then I guess they're disqualified.

982
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,100
- The juice is better than the main dish.
- Our juice can be the main dish.

983
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,660
Yes, of course.
We can turn the juice into the main dish.

984
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:58,140
[- A perfect combination of the ingredients.
- The juice unfortunately outshone the main.]

985
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:03,090
Thai food, which isn't too common here,
is combined with the flavors of kimchi

986
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,150
to be the main point of our meal.

987
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,780
You can also mix in the sprouts, sugar,
and the pepper flakes into the noodles.

988
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:13,640
- The mixed flavors are delicious.
- We've also added some oyster sauce to it.

989
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,910
The noodles are not as soft anymore
since they've been sitting out for a while.

990
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,820
Why don't you also try the
tom yum soup?

991
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,150
[Time to taste the tom yum soup.]

992
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:25,240
You see the chunks of
kimchi in there, don't you?

993
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:32,210
Sir, are you okay?

994
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:37,380
- What's wrong?
[No, I'm not okay!]

995
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,470
- Are you okay?
- Here's some water.

996
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,610
[Everyone rushes over with water
in order to win some brownie points.]

997
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,130
- What did you put in there?
[Are you okay?]

998
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,740
The flavor of the broth
in the soup isn't bad.

999
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:53,820
But I'm not sure how adding the kimchi
to the soup is improving the flavors any.

1000
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:57,470
- It just tastes like tom yum soup.
- Adding the kimchi makes it healthier.

1001
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:02,440
- Then can we just eat it separately?
- That's such a nonsense argument.

1002
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,650
- Sung Ryung really is...
- One thing I'd like to say is...

1003
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,490
- Yes?
- I think it's a love-it-or-hate-it dish.

1004
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:11,620
Isn't that the case
with thai food in general?

1005
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,390
[Is this a judging panel,
or a discussion panel?]

1006
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:21,840
This isn't a great dish, but I'd like to
learn how you used the kimchi in there.

1007
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,530
It's a dish that I'd like to
experiment with myself.

1008
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,240
- We've also prepared a dessert.
- You didn't make this yourself, did you?

1009
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,150
- Yes, we did make it ourselves.
- But isn't this a store bought ice cream?

1010
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,380
- Yes, the ice cream was...
- Then what about it is self-made?

1011
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:38,550
We have the evidence of it right here.

1012
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,690
[The chances of winning first place
is getting dimmer and dimmer...]

1013
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:51,170
[- The flavor isn't bad, and kimchi is good!
- Too strong of a thai flavor?]

1014
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

1015
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,790
- I'm Papa Ha Ha...
- And Mama Shoo.

1016
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:07,900
[Curry kimchi sujebi
and shrimp nacho chips.]

1017
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,640
We traveled down to Jeju Island.

1018
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:20,370
The trip we took to Jeju Island was the first
trip I've taken alone in over eight years.

1019
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,370
[Why are you suddenly tearing up?]

1020
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,220
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you suddenly tearing up?

1021
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,760
- Why are you crying?
- How is that related to cooking?

1022
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:40,910
[It's not our fault that you haven't
been on a vacation in over eight years...]

1023
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:45,550
She was so happy to be away on the trip,
but she immediately thought of her family.

1024
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,200
She was thinking of how nice it would've
been, had her family been there with her.

1025
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,310
So we've relayed those feelings
in the curry dish...

1026
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:56,600
[What's the meaning of that comment?]

1027
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,280
[Time to taste the shrimp nacho chips
and the kimchi salsa.]

1028
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,280
- Is there shrimp in these chips?
- We ground up the shrimp into fine powder.

1029
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,760
[Nacho chips with freshly ground up
shrimp powder.]

1030
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,630
We took fresh shrimp and
ground it up into fine powder.

1031
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,320
- It's the freshest you can imagine.
- I love the salsa.

1032
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,030
- Isn't it good?
- It's made with kimchi.

1033
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,120
- It's awesome.
- It's good, isn't it?

1034
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,480
[Ha Ha and Shoo's dish is getting
rave reviews right from the start.]

1035
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,490
[This time, it's tears of joy.]

1036
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,750
I love the flavors of
the kimchi in the salsa.

1037
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,350
- Really?
- Shall we try the main dish?

1038
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,850
We've also added some cheese
to the sujebi dish.

1039
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:39,810
Cheese was added to mellow out the spiciness
and all the strong flavors of the kimchi.

1040
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,820
[Pointing out the flavors of the pork
and the kimchi in the dish.]

1041
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:48,990
Even though the curry and the kimchi
may sound like an unlikely combination...

1042
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,660
Yes, it is quite unlikely.

1043
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:58,320
[A stew that isn't quite a stew,
but a curry flavored stew.]

1044
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:03,100
It tastes like B-level dish
with the use of A-level ingredients.

1045
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,020
[- Unlikely combo of the main dish.
- Amazing combo of the side dish.]

1046
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:12,810
I made a broth out of the chicken breast,
and made egg drop soup with it.

1047
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,940
Then the fried rice was made with white
pepper, white kimchi, and scallions.

1048
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,780
It's a fusion of Korean
and Chinese cuisine.

1049
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,830
- That's the key to our dishes.
- We learned of these dishes in Hong Kong.

1050
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:29,340
The dim sum dish was taught to us
by a top chef in Hong Kong.

1051
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:33,790
- Which of these is the main dish?
- We took the dishes up a notch.

1052
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,450
The dim sum was a fusion of
using the western baguette.

1053
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:40,670
- What about this is using the baguette?
- You'll know once you try it.

1054
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:45,170
I really enjoyed watching you cook
during the screening process earlier.

1055
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:50,490
I really think that the Chinese flavors
will come through on these dishes.

1056
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:54,630
- You cooked like a real chef.
- Your skills were that of a top level chef.

1057
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,660
[Nonstop compliments towards
Fei's cooking skills.]

1058
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:00,780
We were quite impressed with how you were
using the heat of the fire while cooking.

1059
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,510
- We have high anticipation for this dish.
- We can't wait to try it.

1060
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,510
You seem to be too focused on Fei,
but I also...

1061
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,470
[The panel of judges seem sure of the fact
that only Fei's handiwork is in the dishes.]

1062
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:12,520
- Did you use white kimchi in your dish?
- Yes.

1063
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,470
- Is there kimchi in this dish, too?
- Yes.

1064
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,370
[Even Fei can't escape their scrutinizing.]

1065
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:19,930
[Time for the taste test.]

1066
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:23,550
Fei is used to cooking
Chinese cuisine at home.

1067
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,810
It's really good.

1068
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:33,110
The filling is made with pork and shrimp.

1069
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:36,130
- Did you see the ingredients being used?
- Yes, I did.

1070
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:42,460
I saw all the ingredients she put in there,
and there are lots of healthy ingredients added.

1071
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:45,850
Is there a reason why you
added cumin to your fried rice?

1072
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:53,400
Um... I thought that the use of cumin would
bring out the flavors of Chinese cuisine.

1073
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:00,180
I like the texture of the kimchi in it,
but the cumin is overpowering the flavors.

1074
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,450
The cumin did smell pretty strong.

1075
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:06,410
[Sung Ryung's greed for the win
is shining through in her comments.]

1076
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:09,360
- I saw you cooking the kimchi on its own.
- Yes?

1077
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,310
I think that improved the kimchi's texture,
and I like the use of cumin in the rice dish.

1078
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,260
I like the combination of the flavors.

1079
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,410
It's not easy for us to make the egg soup
taste this good with just the salt either...

1080
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,290
Bringing out the deep flavors of
such simple dish isn't easy.

1081
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:25,070
- Yes, it's a wonderfully deep flavor.
- If Fei and I hadn't worked together...

1082
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,120
- then we wouldn't have been able to do it.
- One disappointing factor is...

1083
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,610
No, you can save that comment
for some other time.

1084
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:39,660
It's very easy for one to think that
the texture of these dishes are too dry.

1085
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,180
- That's why we've prepared the soup.
- We were going to mist it with water.

1086
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,420
- Because their dishes are so dry.
- A sip of our juice will rectify that.

1087
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,490
- Take a sip of our juice.
- Our tea would be perfect to remedy that.

1088
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:54,020
- Keep it down!
- Eat the rice with our tom yum soup.

1089
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,530
- Try our tom yum soup with it.
- How about our carrot juice?

1090
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,700
- Thank you for your hard efforts.
- Thank you.
