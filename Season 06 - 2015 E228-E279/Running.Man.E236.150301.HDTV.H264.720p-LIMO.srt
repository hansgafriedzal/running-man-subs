I danced alone?

30
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,575

performance.

[The Second Real Man Team- Shinhwa.]

32

Do you think you can win over

Who's the black hole (troublemaker)
of this team?

35

36
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,200

- What kind of MC are you?
- I was scared.

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,150
She sounds very serious.

62

Don't you want to start playing?

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,725
Hyung Sik's drama is done.

64
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,800

Taehun fractured his nose.

74
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,225
But he did very well.

75
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:29,825
I was so sad because he started
kickboxing to loose weight.

76
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:34,800
Other people encouraged him and
he ended up debuting as a fighter.

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,825
He was exercising to the beat at first.

78
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,900
They encouraged him
so he got beat up.

79
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,625
When the entertainers learn them,
trainers always encourage us.

80
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,975
Jong Kook almost debuted as a boxer.

81
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:51,699
Jong Kook is really good at boxing.

82
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,600
Too bad! I should have seen
him getting beat up.

83
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,150
[It's fun to imagine Kkuk as a boxer.]

controversy on Twitter.]

It's good for you!

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,350
There are nine members in ZE:A.
Why did only six members come today?

95
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,375
Because there are six members
in Shinhwa.

96
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,500
Everyone should have come.
Even Eric is here.

97
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,400
[Why me?]

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,600
Eric didn't appear
on variety shows back then.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,690
I have the character of Eric.

100
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,350

[The fringe on his sleeve
got caught on the button.]

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,499
- What did you do?
- I clapped.

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,799
Look at you.
What's wrong with your outfit?

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,399
Now, I'll explain the rules
for today's game.

107
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,599

according to the rank.

114

- It's gold, silver and bronze.

117

118
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,390
The first rank can get the
same score as the second rank.

119
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,525
Please keep that in mind.

124
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,995
[Can this be 'Dong-hole'?]

125

the mission site.]

126
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:28,475
- Which car do we take?
- The first one.

127
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,470
See you there!

128

Team Shinhwa can take this car.

129
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,300
Team ZE:A's car is over there.

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,450
Which car do I take?

131
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,900
- What do I take?
- Come with us. We're similar in age.

132

[Dong Jun reaches out his
hand to Ji Hyo.]

00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,400
Thank you, Dong Jun.

[MC Blank gets to team RM's car.]

136
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,320
- Can I go with you?
- Do you have to?

137
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,900
- I need to go.
- We don't have a space for you.

138
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,599

139
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,375
Bye!

140
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,550

The Running Man members
abandoned me!

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,899
I can't believe this!

148
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,870
Listen, everyone.

149
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,000
She'll fall asleep soon.
So, keep quiet.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,450
I don't do that anymore.

151
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,570
This is absurd!

152
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,750
We should try really hard today.

153
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,650
- Suk Jin! Try your best.
- Suk Jin!

154
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,120

[17 years of teamwork and
their cheers.]

158
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:19,125

- Where are we?

159
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,699
[The real man is a strong man!]

160

[ZE:A and MC Blank arrive.]

161

- Go that way.
- We're the last team.

162
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,400
Are we walking on the mud?

[Team RM and
Team Shinhwa arrived first.]

168
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,490
- How long since you debuted?
- I'm sorry!

169
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,300
We... need to take off the shoes.

[What does Kwang Hee put in his boots?]

171
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,425

the shoe lifts in the boots?

00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:07,699
[The first boots with shoe lifts
on Running Man.]

173

[By the way...]

174
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,650
Why did they make the big puddle?

175
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,700
It's almost like the rice field!

176
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,450
Stay with your team!

177
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,100
MC Blank!
MC Blank!

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,300
Each team has six members.
For this game...

179
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,350
you'll divide into three pairs
that are upper, middle, and lower.

180
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,325
Let's make the lower class pair.

181
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,320
- I'm the middle class.
- No.

182
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,970
After you make the pairs,
I will draw lots.

183
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,250
Then, the picked pairs will
play the push.

184
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,800
[Real Man Survival in the mud!]

185
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,570
Move like this!

186
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,670
This is the puddle for it.

187
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,400
The final winner gets one point.

188
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,800
If a team gets two points,
that team is the winner.

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,850
- Is there any other way to win?
- No, there isn't.

190
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,850
You'll lose if you fail.

191
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,290
Dong Jun and Taehun are the upper class.
You and I are the middle class.

192
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,950
They should be the lower class.
They're the weakest.

193
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,300
Are you okay with that?

194
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,470
We already know the pairs.

195
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,000
- Do you want to be the upper class?
- No way.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,290
You can be the upper class.

197
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,175
- I'm the lower class.
- You are?

198
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,790
How come Min Woo
is the lower class?

199
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,050
- Even Andy is the lower class?
- I'm very weak!

200
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:37,250
Eric! Eric should have
gone to the lower class!

201
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,499
Andy is not in good condition!

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,522
We decided our classes
based on the facts.

203
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,750
These four are the lower class
for sure.

204
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:52,600
We'll begin now.
Come out if your class is picked.

205
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Pick a good one!

206
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,850
Your fortune is in my hand.

207
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,900
It's not going to be us.

208
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,225
I'll say it now.

209
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,775
It's the middle class!

210
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:09,850
- It's the middle class!
- Draw it again!

211
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,675
Just come out,
middle class pair!

212
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,225

[Jae Suk and Gary]

216
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,950
Gary, show them what you've got!

217
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,225
Boys, they're your seniors.
Don't be too harsh.

218
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,799
Seniors don't get advantages.

219
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,199
Don't be...

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,725
fair!
Game start!

221
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:38,070
[Battle of the middle class begins.]

222
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,420

[We must win!]

224
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,800
[They start with investigation.]

225
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,375
As soon as you show your
weakness, two teams will attack!

226
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,650
Don't go in the middle!

227
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,275
[Jun Young attacks Hye Sung.]

228
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,125

[This is a 2:1 match.]
[Dong Wan and Hye Sung vs. Jae Suk]

246
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,850
[What should I do?]

247
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,570
Splash the water!

248
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,875
Put Jae Suk on the ground!

249
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,520
[They are closing in on Jae Suk.]
- What a coincidence!

250
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,350
Slowly! slowly!

251
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:32,500
[This is the facial wash of
a middle class man!]

252
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:34,575

In spite of the cold weather,
five bulls were fighting

Are you using me?

333
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,375
Let's attack ZE:A together!

334
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,200

352
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,375
This match doesn't have a winner!

353
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,150
[They began to reach their
physical limits.]

354
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,575
[His eyes are smeared with mud.]

355
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:02,670
It looks like a martial arts match.

356
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,570
Where are we?

357
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,325
Please give me a glass of water!

358
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,590
We're all winners!

359
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,399
[That's an excuse!]

360
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,250
If you were alive,
this wouldn't happen.

361
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:22,500
You're not cold?

362
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,990
Give me some water.

363
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,490
[They never felt this tired before.]

364
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,850
[Way to be a real man]

365
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,450
[I want to win, but I'm too tired...]

366
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,390
If this match doesn't end
in two minutes

367
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,600
ZE:A will get one point
because two players remained.

368
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,950
If the situation continues
for two more minutes.

369
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,499
[Should we start the real men'
beach party again?]

370
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,400
[We'll hold it for two minutes!]

371
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,700
ZE:A's Kim Jong Kook!

372
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,790
[They don't even have any
energy to laugh.]

373
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,570
Turbo! Turbo!
Turbo! Turbo!

374
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,525
[He really needs the energy
of a turbo engine.]

375
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:12,500
Don't.

376
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,000
Get up and do it again!

377
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,020
He chained his fingers.

378
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,100
[They're blocking Mr. Capable.]

379
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Only one minute left!

380
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,475
[Just one more minute to hold.]

381
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,250
The time is almost over.

382
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,920
[He can't even talk straight...]

383
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,100
[Taehun doesn't let him go.]

384
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,750
Lie down!

385
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,999
One minute and thirty seconds passed.

386
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,299
Only 30 seconds remaining!

387
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,150
No! Don't!

388
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,950
[I'm Mr. Capable.
I don't know what giving up means.]

389
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,500
[I'll push you out!]

390
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,525
[Dong Jun resisted til the end.]

391
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,775
[The battle of the real men.]

392
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,550
[Team ZE:A wins.]
[The teams gets one point.]

393
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,050
You've worked so hard.

394
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,050
[He can't get up by himself.]

395
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,650
[The real men showed their passion.]

396
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,725
Kim Jong Kook!
Kim Jong Kook!

397
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:48,570
[The real man who couldn't stand up.]

398
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,600
Sadly, each team has one point.

399
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:57,170
What was the benefit to
winning this round?

400
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,650
- The dice.
- Are the dice that great?

401
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,325
What if everyone gets in?

402
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,890
Why don't you get in?

403
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,390
I think we can draw lots by luck.

404
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,400
Two members from each team.

405
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,899
- I have it right here.
- It looks fun!

406
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,599
I will draw it myself.

407
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
[From team Shinhwa...]

408
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,770
Min Woo!

409
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,950
[Min Woo from the lower class.]

410
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:35,190
This isn't fair!

411
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,000
He is the Celebrity Shim Kwon Ho!
(legendary wrestler)

412
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,290
From Team ZE:A...

413
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,499
- Pick Kwang Hee!
- No, don't pick me!

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,400
Ha Ha!

419
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400

We'll begin now!

431

an alliance?]

432
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,620
Begin!

['O' Women's University,
it seems like spring has come.]

533
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,599
Everyone's worked hard.

534
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:46,950
[Countless university students
greet them.]

535
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,499
[Welcome to a woman's university.]

536
00:32:54,575 --> 00:33:00,800
[They're welcomed with an
enthusiastic greeting.]

537
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:07,050
[The women's university is filled
with fever in early spring.]

538
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,075
[What kind of match awaits them?]

539
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:21,399
[This looks like they're having a festival.]

540
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,125
Thank you for coming.

541
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,870
We're at Ewha Women's University.

542
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,570
As you can see from the arrangement,
do you know what you'll play?

543
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,550
- Dodge ball!
- Yes, it is dodge ball.

544
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,100
Please do not dodge when you talk.

545
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,290
Only two teams can play
at a time.

546
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,975
So we'll pick a team
that will win by default.

547
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:51,899
We'll play another game for it.

548
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,475
Everyone knows this game.

549
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,500
The team representatives are
these three?

550
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,899
They are the trouble makers of the teams.

551
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,599
Dong-hole, Kwang-hole, and Hee-hole.

552
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Hello, everyone!
We're the holes!

553
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:22,320
- You'll play 'rock-paper-scissors'.
- 'Rock-paper-scissors'?

554
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,575
It'll be a single round match
at MC's discretion!

555
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,075
- Can't you control her?
- You're out!

556
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:35,225
[Charismatic MC Blank]

557
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:37,220
Rock-paper-scissors!

558
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,475
[Rock, paper, scissors]

559
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,800
Kwang-hole and Hee-hole win.

560
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,150
[It's fine, Dong-hole.]

561
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:59,150
[Kwang-hole and Hee-hole's match.]

562
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,420
You'll win by default
if you win this one.

563
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,575
I'm nervous.

564
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:11,550
You'll lose if you don't play.

565
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,675
[How did the teams' luck
end up with these two?]

566
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,900
Rock, scissors, paper!

567
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:26,100
[Kwang-hole wins.]

568
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:32,750
[Team RM wins by default.]

569
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,600
[The semi-final is
Team Shinhwa vs. Team ZE:A.]

570
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,475
- Men choose rock!
- Thank you, Kwang Hee.

571
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:48,699
This is the main match.

572
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,400
[We'll play dodge ball
with students of this school.]

573
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,620
This is a game of 'Queen dodge ball'.

574
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,050
You need to protect your queen.

575
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,500
The last person who survives
with the queen never dies.

576
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,820
The last person needs only
to protect the queen.

577
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,450
Even though he gets hit,
he's like a Super Saiyan.

578
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,670
Super Saiyan?
('Dragon Ball Z' reference.)

579
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,486
[She might attack you
with energy waves.]

580
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:22,100
<i>We cast 100 students from
Ewha Women's University.</i>

581
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,399
<i>We'll pick three numbers.</i>

582
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,950
<i>Students with the chosen numbers
will play dodge ball.</i>

583
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:36,499
[We'll pick a number for each team
and select their queens.]

584
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,300
[100 candidates to be queen.]

585
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:42,190
Who will be the Queen of Team RM?

586
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,025
The Queen of Team RM is...

587
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,250
Number thirty...

588
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,050
- Number 34!
- Did you see it?

589
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,225
[When did he see it?]

590
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:01,999
- He saw it.
- It's number 34!

591
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,975
- Where are you?
- Number 34!

592
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,125
[The Queen of Team RM.]

593
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,725
[She's lucky!]

594
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,625
Oh, my Queen!

595
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,899
Oh my Queen!
Oh my Queen!

596
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,250
Next, we'll pick for Team Shinhwa.

597
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:27,899
The Queen of Team Shinhwa is...

598
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:31,099
- Number 14!
- Number 14!

599
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,300
[The Queen of Team Shinhwa]

600
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:42,425
[Queen's bodyguards walk with her.]

601
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,650
It's ZE:A's turn!

602
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,250
- The Queen of Team ZE:A is...
- The Queen of Team ZE:A is...

603
00:37:55,375 --> 00:38:00,575
- Number 31!
- Number 31!

604
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,500
[The active Queen of ZE:A]

605
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,625
[They must be happy.]

606
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,970
- Please stand next to Jae Suk.
- Come here.

607
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,570
Jo Yun Sun! Jo Yun Sun!

608
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,525
Did you want to be
the Queen of Team RM?

609
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,275
- Yes.
- You did?

610
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:32,099
Who do you hope will stay
until the end?

611
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:38,000
- Don't worry, I'll protect you.
- You'll be ousted soon.

612
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,399
I'll be your bodyguard.
Don't worry!

613
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,999
- What's your name?
- We'll introduce her.

614
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,899
<i>Our queen is Julie, Julie, Julie.
We're Shinhwa, Shinhwa, Shinhwa.</i>

615
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, Julie!

616
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,700
[The Queen of Team Shinhwa, Julie.]

617
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,320
- Do you know the group, Shinhwa?
- Yes.

618
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,050
My Norwegian friends like
Shinhwa's songs.

619
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,290
Do you know what
'Queen dodge ball' is?

620
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,675
- Queen dodge ball.
[I don't know what queen dodge ball is.]

621
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:12,699
You know dodge ball, right?
We'll protect you during the game.

622
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,699
Because you're the Queen.

623
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,150
Okay, then you can explain to her.

624
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,650
[MC Blank lets them explain to her.]

625
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,299
What's your name?

626
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,590
Seo Min Ji.

627
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,670
- Do you like ZE:A?
- Yes.

628
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,820
- Who do you like the most?
- Park Hyung Sik.

629
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,950
Why?

630
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,900
[Hyung Sik stands
next to the Queen.]

631
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,300
Look at Hyung Sik's eyes.
He's romantic.

632
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,350
I will put my life on the line!

633
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:54,550
The bluish team who won
by default can go to the side.

634
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,450
She called us 'the bluish team.'

635
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,557
[Team Shinhwa vs Team ZE:A-
Getting ready for the competition.]

636
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:05,911
- You can do this, right?
- Forget the queen, and just protect me.

637
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:09,155
We have to be careful,
and protect my nose and my face.

638
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,679
I'll stick close to the queen.

639
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:16,746
[Once again, Eric takes on the role
of explaining the rules of the game to her.]

640
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:24,419
The opposing team will try to kill you
by hitting you with the ball.

641
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,763
Team ZE:A, fighting.
One, two, three, fighting!

642
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:30,308
[Even their cheers are all over the place.]

643
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:32,465
[No matter, fighting!]

644
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:37,854
One, two, three, fighting!
[Continuing to cheer on even after 17 years.]

645
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:45,048
[Passionate round of cheers
from the crowd for the teams.]

646
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:50,317
The first team to grab the ball at the sound
of the whistle will possess the ball.

647
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:56,028
[Hit the opposing queen with the ball,
and it's an immediate win for the team.]

648
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:59,286
[It all comes down to how well
they can protect their own queen.]

649
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:03,762
- Ready...
[Will Team Shinhwa maintain their dignity...]

650
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:08,144
[Or will the enthusiasm of the
younger idols bring home the victory?]

651
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:10,876
Ready... set, go!

652
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,213
[ZE:A's Dong Jun races forward...
then freezes.]

653
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:20,401
What is he doing?

654
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:25,622
[Thanks to Dong Jun's speed,
Team ZE:A's on the offense.]

655
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:28,492
Do it.

656
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:35,061
[In the blink of an eye,
Min Woo is ousted.]

657
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:40,955
[Rule- Even though one may be ousted,
one can still attack from the sidelines.]

658
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,343
It's our ball now, isn't it?

659
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:44,644
[Team Shinhwa takes over the offense.]

660
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,773
[Hye Sung shoots!]

661
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,475
[And spikes the ball into the ground.]

662
00:41:57,476 --> 00:42:00,616
[Hye Sung's newly invented
shooting star spike.]

663
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:06,176
[It's not as easy as it looks?]

664
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:11,827
Who should I go for?
Who should I go for?

665
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,349
[Absolute fear]

666
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,593
[Min Woo shoots the ball.]

667
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:21,336
[They're very good at avoiding the ball.]

668
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:28,577
- We have to protect the queen.
- Kwang Hee, don't stand off on your own.

669
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:34,617
- Don't go off on your own.
[The queen avoids the ball on her own.]

670
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,220
[Min Woo slams in another shot.]

671
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:43,172
[Hyung Sik is eliminated.]

672
00:42:43,173 --> 00:42:47,237
- Are there two queens on their team?
[A newly invented version of dodgeball.]

673
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:49,179
You just need to eliminate the queen
in order to win the game.

674
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,567
Yoon Sun, don't worry about a thing,
and just use us as your bodyguards.

675
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:53,168
Okay?

676
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:54,578
[Team Shinhwa continues their offense.]

677
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,712
- Please save us.
[Throw it up high.]

678
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:05,733
[Even as Eric only grabs the ball,
the fans from the crowd goes crazy.]

679
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:11,504
[Even though he may be our opponent,
he's still so cool.]

680
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:16,580
[While everyone's attention
is focused on Eric...]

681
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,948
[Hye Sung shoots the ball.]

682
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,885
[The queen's eyes are still
fixated on Eric.]

683
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,993
[Who cares about the ball
when Eric is here!]

684
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:34,374
[It's a direct hit on the queen!]

685
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,094
[A quick victory for Team Shinhwa!]

686
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:45,766
[The queen gets ousted while
her focus is shifted over to Eric.]

687
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:55,083
[Even the onlookers are confused
by what just happened.]

688
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:04,508
[What just happened...
Did we just lose?]

689
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:07,810
[Team Shinhwa moves onto the playoffs.]

690
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,438
Shin Hye Sung!

691
00:44:15,472 --> 00:44:18,767
Those ground spikes I did
were done on purpose.

692
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:21,312
- Wow, I can't believe it.
- That was unreal.

693
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:23,774
[A huge round of applause for the queen.]

694
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:28,018
- We're sorry for having lost so quickly.
- Who was supposed to shield you?

695
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:30,315
- Heechul.
- But Heechul avoided the ball.

696
00:44:30,316 --> 00:44:32,269
[Heechul avoids the ball at the last minute,
and gets their own queen ousted.]

697
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:36,860
[As the ball flies towards him,
he instinctively moves out of the way.]

698
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,578
- Heechul, you were supposed to block her.
[Did I really do that?]

699
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:47,884
- I was going to do it, but the ball...
- You waited for six years to do this?

700
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:51,600
[The fear of being hit by the ball must've
been worse than the six-year wait.]

701
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:56,343
[At last, it's time for the playoffs.]

702
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,718

manage to keep their queen safe?]

705
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,590
- Is everybody warmed up?
- Yes.

706
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:17,887
- Okay, we'll get started.

707
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,155
[Team RM is ready and revving to go.]

708
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:22,731
[Team Shinhwa has gotten a good feel for
the game after playing the previous round.]

709
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:26,591
- Who's going to shield the queen?
- I'll shield her, and keep her protected.

710
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:27,986
[Mr. Capable volunteers himself
as the shield.]

711
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:32,881
[If Jong Kook is the shield...
then how are we going to do this?]

712
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:39,904
[Practicing the moves with the queen.]

713
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:44,710
The winner of this round will
get to roll the gold dice, okay?

714
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:48,227

[The two teams are ready
to protect their queens.]

716
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:55,562
- Okay, we're going to get started!
[Even Team ZE:A looks nervous.]

717
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,811
Ready...

718
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:03,558
[This is the round where the pride
of their manhood balances on the line.]

719
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:08,949
[Keep the queen protected to the end,
and win the golden dice.]

720
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,717
Ready, set, go!

[Dong Wan of Team Shinhwa
rushes out to grab the ball.]

722
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:21,507
[Team Shinhwa is on the offense.]

723
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:25,995
[But why are they hesitating
instead of attacking?]

724
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,053
[A steel-like line of defense.]

725
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:38,818
[Team Shinhwa's resolve is shaken
in front of Team RM's line of defense.]

726
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,289
[Andy's unbelievable mistake.]

727
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:44,471
[The offensive move is handed over
to Team RM in the blink of an eye.]

728
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:48,452
[Ha Ha shoots the ball
with everything he has.]

729

be impressed by Jun Jin's move.]

732
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:08,141

Jun Jin, I can't believe
you grabbed the ball.

736
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:26,378
- Ugh, I was so shocked.
- Gary, you can do this.

737
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:28,044
[Team RM takes over the attack.]

738
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:35,165
[Team Shinhwa's turn to showcase
a nice defensive move.]

739
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:38,023
[As soon as their offense is over, Team RM
is back to being a fortress of defense.]

740
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:41,400
[If you think you can get through,
then why don't you give it a try?]

741
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:44,999
[If that's the way you want to play it...]

742
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,420
[Team Shinhwa switches up their plans.]

743
00:47:48,136 --> 00:47:52,214

their jacket to confuse their opponents.]

744
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:56,540
[The orange army's plan of confusion.]

745
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,085

- Where did the ball go?

746
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:02,090
[Where did the ball go?]
- I can't see the ball!

747
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:04,446
[Then shoots the ball!]

748
00:48:05,974 --> 00:48:08,662
[Team Shinhwa eliminates Jae Suk.]

749
00:48:09,118 --> 00:48:12,961
[Team Shinhwa's attack breaks through
Team RM's steel-like line of defense.]

750
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:15,434
- What just happened?
- They have the ball.

751
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,754
- We have to try flustering them.
[Team RM also switches up their plan.]

752
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:24,610
[It's impossible to decipher
Kwang Soo's shuffle moves.]

753
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:31,882
[Even his own teammates are
quite confused.]

754
00:48:31,883 --> 00:48:35,208
- What are you doing?
[Knock it off.]

755
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,905
[The safety of the queen is
entrusted to Mr. Capable.]

756

[Easy Brothers resort to
their secretive offense moves.]

757
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,969
[What are they working on?]

758
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,329
[What luck is this?]

759
00:49:01,794 --> 00:49:03,936
[Ah...]

760
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:06,874
[Oh my goodness.]

761
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:11,612
[I can't believe this!]

762
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:18,275
[His own teammates, opponents,
and the onlookers are all feeling shocked.]

763
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,281
- Don't you think that's going overboard?
- Jun Jin, that was a great shot!

764
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:33,920
- Suk Jin.
- Ugh, that was hurtful to my pride.

00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,108
[Big-nose is ousted with a big laughter.]

766

768
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:47,565
Stand over there.

770
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,890

[Jae Suk grabs the perfect chance!]

772
00:50:02,155 --> 00:50:07,448

[Min Woo passes the ball
perfectly over to Jun Jin.]

777

[So, you've eliminated me
from the game?]

778
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:34,121
[Ha Ha's provocation.]

779
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:39,815
[Eye for an eye,
provocation for provocation.]

780
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:44,156
[In the midst of provocation...
Jun Jin shoots the ball!]

781
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,629
[Ha Ha barely manages to
escape the danger.]

[Hye Sung is already ousted
from having touched the ball.]

785
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:08,536

and instinctively ducks from the ball.]

786
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,968
[A bloody battle between real men.]

787
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,574

[Team RM's stable long pass.]

828
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:16,991

[Close, but ends up earning 90 points.]

861
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,022
[Powerful and mannerly,
Team RM wins twice in a row.]

862
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:09,758
- 90 points.
- Okay, everyone...

863
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:16,349
We'd like to give another round of thanks to
the three queens and to our cheerful crowd.

864
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,239
[A shocking and totally unexpected
final mission is soon headed your way.]

865
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:28,235
[Han River Yang-Hwa Jigu.]

866
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:31,523
What's this all about now?

867
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,803
[Why do they all look so shocked?]

868
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:45,042
I've never seen such a huge
setup before.

869
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:50,079
[A specially prepared setup
for the toughest of all men.]

870
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:57,888
[When it comes to real men,
it's all about loyalty.]

871
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:02,565
[Dream big, and keep it loyal-
A set prepared for our group of real men.]

872
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,733
This is our final game of the day.

873
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,841
[2015's masterpiece that combines
science and entertainment.]

874
00:58:09,148 --> 00:58:12,166
- Do you see the set behind you?
- Yes, we see it.

875
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:17,452
We have prepared something special for you.
You can imagine what's to come, right?

876
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,852
Yes, I see that there's
a bell up there.

877
00:58:18,853 --> 00:58:23,508
The first team to climb up and ring
the bell, wins the round.

878
00:58:23,509 --> 00:58:25,577
[Rule- It's very simple,
be the first to ring the bell to win.]

879
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:28,927
But it's not just a simple
climb up the ramp.

880
00:58:29,294 --> 00:58:34,846
The first person will climb up,
then the next person will climb up his back.

881
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:37,002
It will continue in this fashion
until all members are finished climbing.

882
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:42,940
All five members have to climb up, and
the last person will have to ring the bell.

883
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:45,136
- That's how the game will be won.
- Climb on top of each other?

884
00:58:45,137 --> 00:58:48,206
- We have to step all over each other?
- This is just absurd!

885
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:51,895
Is this even possible?

886
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:57,503
[You want us to become a human ladder
to climb up this giant ramp ourselves?]

887
00:58:57,504 --> 00:59:00,000
[It's a game of endurance and loyalty!
Which team will get to ring the bell?]

888
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:03,907
- The lightest person will have to be last.
- Let's have Andy go last.

889
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:07,035
[The teams are given some time
to formulate their game plan.]

890
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:11,152
- Just step on the back and the shoulders.
- One, two, three, four, five.

891
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:14,059
[Figuring out the correct order of players
will be a key to winning this game.]

892
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,241
You have to lean your weight
onto the angle of the ramp.

893
00:59:17,242 --> 00:59:21,345
- We have to utilize the angle.
- Position your weight onto the angle.

894
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:25,274
- I'll go first.
- You can be the first player.

895
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:27,942
[Taehun of Team ZE:A volunteers to be
on the bottom for being the strongest.]

896
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:32,346
The last person to go needs to be the one
who'd be best at climbing over people.

897
00:59:32,347 --> 00:59:36,265
- It needs to be whoever is lightest.
[They're not going to pick me, are they?]

898
00:59:36,557 --> 00:59:39,490
Either the strongest or the tallest
needs to be on the bottom.

899
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:44,079
- Either Kwang Soo or myself...
- I'll go first.

900
00:59:45,029 --> 00:59:48,573
- I think you need to go second.
- I'm not sure if I can climb up.

901
00:59:48,574 --> 00:59:52,134
I don't think too much weight will be placed
on the bottom because of the ramp's angle.

902
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:55,982
- But there's still going to be some weight.
- Then I'll go third.

903
00:59:56,465 --> 01:00:01,960
[A real man speaks with his actions.
Team Shinhwa launches into practice mode.]

904
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:04,297
Don't slam into the person,
but carefully climb over their bodies.

905
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,571
[Hee-hole already starts to scream out in
protest on only their third member.]

906
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:17,600
- Kwang Hee, you have to support him.
- Ouch, that hurts!

907
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:20,783
[I don't think this game
suits me very well.]

908
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:27,680
- What are we going to do with him!
[He can't be trusted to handle anything.]

909
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:30,202
Kwang Hee, you're really worrying us.

910
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:32,752
I'm okay, you can step on me.

911
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:35,211
[1. Kwang Soo. 2. Suk Jin. 3. Jae Suk.]

912
01:00:35,705 --> 01:00:41,525
[Kwang Soo and Suk Jin are bearing
the most of the weight by themselves.]

913
01:00:41,526 --> 01:00:43,707
- Hang on.
- Are you sure that you're okay?

914
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,830
[Once Jong Kook is in place,
their fourth level will be completed.]

915
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:48,852
You're starting to crumble.

916
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,792
[Suk Jin is throwing up his hip in defeat?]

917
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:56,400
- Just let go, and have Kwang Soo get up.
- Wait, not yet.

918
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:58,954
[It seems Big-nose may have to
move onto a different position.]

919
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:01,250
We can't have Suk Jin be
the second player.

920
01:01:01,582 --> 01:01:03,660
I feel really nervous.

921
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,785
This is much harder than it looks.

922
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:13,101
[The giant ramp is much harder than it
looks now that it's become a reality.]

923
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:18,973
[But it's now time to join hands
and climb over the wall together.]

924
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,703
- Okay, have you all formulated your plans?
- Yes.

925
01:01:23,704 --> 01:01:27,034
[Final mission-
Human Ladder Game]

926
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:29,079
The first person to
ring the bell wins first place.

927
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,425
Second to ring will win second place,
and the third will come in at third place.

928
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,005
- Okay, we understand.
- It's one single game.

929
01:01:34,006 --> 01:01:36,491
- Okay, let's do this!
- Fighting!

930
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,968
[Only one chance will be given! And
there will be only one team of real men!]

931
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:46,008
[Gather together, endure together,
and trust in each other!]

932
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:50,862
[A battle of endurance and trust,
Human Ladder Mission.]

933
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:54,033
Ready, set, go!

934
01:01:54,716 --> 01:01:56,658
[First players rushes over to the ramp.]

935
01:01:56,659 --> 01:02:00,669
[In first position-
Kwang Soo, Eric, and Taehun.]

936
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:05,466
[In second position-
Suk Jin, Hye Sung, and Jun Young.]

937
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:12,499
[The third position of the ladder
has to be of someone trustworthy!]

938
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,701
[In third position-
Jae Suk, Dong Wan, and Hyung Sik.]

939
01:02:24,581 --> 01:02:29,077
[The third position is completed
for all three teams.]

940
01:02:29,951 --> 01:02:34,701
[Fourth position-
Jong Kook, Min Woo, and Kwang Hee.]

941
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:46,208
[While fourth position gets into place,
first position is already feeling like death.]

942
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:51,824
[Fifth position-
Ha Ha, Andy, and Heechul.]

943
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:55,957
[Once the fifth position is in place,
victory is just around the corner.]

944
01:02:55,958 --> 01:03:00,947
[First to get into fifth position could
determine who'll become the victor.]

945
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:06,767
[Overenthusiastic Dong Jun runs in
before fifth position is even in place]

946
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:13,436
[Team ZE:A attempts to kill
two birds with one stone.]

947
01:03:13,966 --> 01:03:17,391
[Wait... will this be their victory?]

948
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:20,841
[At this rate,
Team ZE:A could win the mission!]

949
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:26,045
[Wait, a member of Team ZE:A
slips out of place!]

950
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:34,405
[Member in third position
crumbles under all the weight.]

951
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:40,686
[Failure is a learning opportunity! The team
groups together for another attempt.]

952
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,539
They crumbled.

953
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:49,135
[In that case...
This could be our chance at a win!]

954
01:03:49,136 --> 01:03:52,994
[Goes in for the victory
with a powerful run.]

955
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,130
No!

956
01:03:57,692 --> 01:04:00,992
[The ladder crumbles!]

957
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,372
[The team crumbles under the weakened
bottom and the powerful run of the final player.]

958
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:16,048
[Team RM is the only ladder left intact!]

959
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:21,089
[Perhaps the steady footsteps are
the better way to go rather than speed?]

960
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,067
Jae Suk, no!

961
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:25,788
- Jae Suk is starting to slide.
- Fighting!

962
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:31,819
[I think I'm starting
to get a little tired...]

963
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,580
- Get down.
- Why!

964
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,394
[Even being too slow is a problem.
The bottom rungs are feeling exhausted.]

965
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:48,983
[The teams seems to have gotten a
feel for it after their initial failure.]

966
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:53,338
[There's no more room for failure!
Launches back in without any hesitation.]

967
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:56,764
[Team Shinhwa assumes
their original position.]

968
01:04:56,765 --> 01:04:59,312
[Team RM and Team ZE:A swap out
their first two positions.]

969
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,062
[Team RM- Jong Kook for Suk Jin.
Team ZE:A- Dong Jun for Jun Young.]

970
01:05:02,853 --> 01:05:06,856
[Third position-
Jae Suk, Dong Wan, and Jun Young.]

971
01:05:06,857 --> 01:05:11,944
[The teams have found new determination
after their initial failure.]

972
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:21,184
[Fourth position-
Suk Jin, Min Woo, Heechul.]

973
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,574
- Andy's coming!
- Step on the shoulders.

974
01:05:27,913 --> 01:05:33,420
[Fifth position-
Andy, Hyung Sik, and Gary.]

975
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:38,690
[A very close competition.]

976
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:47,493
[The victory comes down to
the final player.]

977
01:05:53,665 --> 01:05:55,485
Here I come!

978
01:05:55,486 --> 01:05:59,032
[Final position-
Jun Jin, Kwang Hee, and Ha Ha.]

979
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:13,721
[Gather together as a team!
Endure and trust in each other!]

980
01:06:13,722 --> 01:06:22,380
[The battle between real men where
endurance and trust is the key!]

981
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,907
[Will Jun Jin win with his determination?]

982
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:28,887
[Or will it be Kwang Hee, the black hole?]

983
01:06:28,888 --> 01:06:32,381
[Or the unexpected, Ha Ha?]

984
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:42,427
[Team Shinhwa and Team ZE:A's final spurt
with their pride hanging on the line.]

985
01:06:45,022 --> 01:06:52,190
[Just who... will take home the victory?]

986
01:06:52,496 --> 01:06:55,829
[I will keep going forward
with my gritted teeth.]

987
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,348
[Hold on just a little bit longer.]

988
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:11,540
[Team Shinhwa wins first place
in the human ladder mission.]

989
01:07:12,471 --> 01:07:16,177
[This is the strength of having been
a team for the past 17 years.]

990
01:07:17,941 --> 01:07:20,984
[Kwang Hee's struggling to move
forward with his slippery socks.]

991
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:25,396
[Even takes off his gloves in his desperation
to come in at second place.]

992
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:29,807
[Please hurry...]

993
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:34,356
[I've finally made it to the top!]

994
01:07:34,357 --> 01:07:37,555
[Team ZE:A wins second place!]

995
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:44,788
[Team RM crumbles in their disbelief
at having come in at last place.]

996
01:07:46,842 --> 01:07:54,333
[We are... Team Shinhwa.]

997
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:58,505
[I won first place!]

998
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:04,201
[Who cares about having won?
Bottom rungs are completely exhausted.]

999
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:07,221
- I'm sorry, it was my slippery socks.
- He's definitely the black hole of the team.

1000
01:08:08,122 --> 01:08:13,665
- Come down, Hee-hole.
[Just what is he ever good at?]

1001
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,524
[At a loss for words.]

1002
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:20,528
[After today's events, he'll be
forever known as, 'socks of holes.']

1003
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:24,580
- I was so close.
- We know, but Kwang Soo slipped.

1004
01:08:24,581 --> 01:08:27,802
- I was so close to being first.
- But Kwang Soo started to slip.

1005
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,894
This is the first time we won today.

1006
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:32,973
- Get us the 60 points.
- Will he get a miracle?

1007
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:36,602
[The dice is thrown into the air.]

1008
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:43,097
[Could this be their lucky day?
Throws the highest score of 60 points.]

1009
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:47,522
[Why do they feel like they've
just lost?]

1010
01:08:48,445 --> 01:08:50,847
Doesn't that mean you've
won first place?

1011
01:08:50,848 --> 01:08:54,628
[Team ZE:A throws second for
having come in at second place.]

1012
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:59,645
[Not a bad throw of 70 points.]

1013
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:04,717
[What will the first place winners,
Team Shinhwa, throw?]

1014
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:06,976
[A high score of 90 points.]

1015
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:10,101
- All the games are now over.
- Okay.

1016
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:14,558
The fate of the final score
with these numbers...

1017
01:09:14,559 --> 01:09:18,354
[What?
It's not over yet?]

1018
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:25,700
[It's not over until it's over.
Running Man's final hurdle.]

1019
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:30,902
[A surprising final medal judging platform.]

1020
01:09:30,903 --> 01:09:35,527
- What is this?
[What could this setup be for?]

1021
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:41,006
[Look at how the set shines
so brightly against the night sky.]

1022
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:43,912
I see something over there.

1023
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:49,189
[Suspicious looking rolls of
brightly colored paper.]

1024
01:09:50,393 --> 01:09:52,784
There's something.

1025
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:57,908
[Real man and the lady of luck.]

1026
01:09:57,909 --> 01:10:04,400
Song Ji Hyo will now turn in her MC mic,
and go stand on the gold platform over there.

1027
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:07,480
[What will MC Blank be doing
with the rolls of colored paper?]

1028
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:10,385
- It must be up to Blank Ji.
- What is this?

1029
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:11,941
[Lady of luck.]

1030
01:10:11,942 --> 01:10:14,862
I'm the Lady of Luck.

1031
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:18,229
[MC Blank is immediately transformed
into the Lady of Luck.]

1032
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:22,516
[All the men are trying to win
the favor of the Lady of Luck.]

1033
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:28,616
[What is the reason for needing
the Lady of Luck during this event?]

1034
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:32,687
You'll see that your team banners
have been set above your heads.

1035
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:36,772
Your current standing scores will be
lit up above each of the teams.

1036
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:42,454
The first number is the combined score
after the first two rounds.

1037
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:48,848
And the second number represents
the score that you've just received.

1038
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:55,507
In the rolls of paper in front of Ji Hyo,
there are either plus or minus signs.

1039
01:10:55,508 --> 01:10:58,323
[Plus and minus signs sit in
front of Ji Hyo in the rolls of paper.]

1040
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:03,624
[A 50/50 chance-
30 minus, and 30 plus signs.]

1041
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,567
Ji Hyo will pull out a sign and
determine the teams' final score.

1042
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:11,889
[Depending on the sign that she chooses,
the victory is still up for grabs.]

1043
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:14,736
The two teams with the lower scores
will have to face a penalty.

1044
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:18,033
- Seriously?
- Two teams will have to face a penalty!

1045
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:22,868
- It's either a plus or a minus signs.
- The fate rests in Song Ji Hyo's hands.

1046
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:28,693
[Time to start cheering for Ji Hyo!]

1047
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:33,163
Wait, can I go and take off
my underwear real quick?

1048
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,881
[Afraid of getting soaked by the water.]

1049
01:11:34,882 --> 01:11:37,451
We're not going to get
rained on by rocks, are we?

1050
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:41,034
[All the men are starting to
shake with fear.]

1051
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:45,333
<i>Let's all go home nice and dry.</i>

1052
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:49,497
- Please take care of us, Ji Hyo.
- Seriously, this is so chancy!

1053
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:53,883
- Please, Ji Hyo!
- The beautiful Ji Hyo!

1054
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:57,405
[Depending on what she pulls,
it could either be a plus or a minus!]

1055
01:11:57,406 --> 01:12:01,781
- Team ZE:A!
[A red roll is pulled for Team ZE:A.]

1056
01:12:05,535 --> 01:12:09,559
Song Ji Hyo!

1057
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,323
[ Team Shinhwa-
Either 230 points, or 50 points.]

1058
01:12:14,324 --> 01:12:18,601
- Team Shinhwa!
[A blue roll is selected for Team Shinhwa.]

1059
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:21,460
Take care of us, Blank Ji.

1060
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:27,935
[Either 250 points,
or 130 points for Team RM.]

1061
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:31,940
You look really sweet today. Think
of the five years we've spent together.

1062
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:34,115
Take care of us.

1063
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,240
Don't choose the white roll!

1064
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:38,665
I have a bad feeling about
the white one.

1065
01:12:39,081 --> 01:12:42,693
[Since you say that you have
a bad feeling about the white...]

1066
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:46,813
[I'll choose the white for you!]

1067
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:51,988
[Depending on what she's chosen,
Team ZE:A could even take over the lead.]

1068
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:57,951
[Which team has the Lady of Luck
smiled down upon?]

1069
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:00,586
We can win if we got the plus sign.

1070
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:04,411
- Are we going to look at the score now?
- I'm going to stand here with confidence.

1071
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:09,566
- Let's start off with a minus sign!
- Team ZE:A first!

1072
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:13,359
[Team ZE:A's sign is...]
- Let it be a minus!

1073
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,709
- Minus!
- No, it has to be a plus!

1074
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:22,731
[Team ZE:A.... a plus!]

1075
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,727
[The best case scenario-
A total of 170 points.]

1076
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,597
[Team ZE:A's final score- 170 points.]

1077
01:13:29,598 --> 01:13:33,131
Song Ji Hyo!

1078
01:13:33,132 --> 01:13:35,857
If the two other teams get a minus,
then Team ZE:A will win.

1079
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:38,516
- I doubt that'll happen.
- Let it be a minus!

1080
01:13:38,517 --> 01:13:44,515
- Minus!
[Let it be a minus for Team Shinhwa.]

1081
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:50,902
[A minus would mean a penalty for Shinhwa,
and a plus would mean a penalty for ZE:A.]

1082
01:13:50,903 --> 01:13:53,394
Shinhwa's sign is...

1083
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:58,157
[Shinhwa's sign is...]

1084
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,327
[A plus sign for Shinhwa!]

1085
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:04,964
[Currently in the lead with 230 points.]

1086
01:14:04,965 --> 01:14:07,789
[Team ZE:A earns one penalty spot.]

1087
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:10,577
Song Ji Hyo!

1088
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:16,575
[Team Shinhwa ends with
a total score of 230 points.]

1089
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:20,168
- Team ZE:A will have to face a penalty.
- We've been prepared to face it.

1090
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:27,616
Team ZE:A final score is 170,
and Team Shinhwa's final score is 230.

1091
01:14:27,617 --> 01:14:30,697
Team RM currently has 190 and 60.

1092
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:34,737
If they get a plus sign, they win with 250.
If they get a minus, then they lose with 130.

1093
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:37,404
Please just end this suspense!

1094
01:14:37,405 --> 01:14:41,789
In which case, Team Shinhwa will win,
and Team RM and Team ZE:A are penalized.

1095
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:45,857
But with the two plus signs already,
there's a high chance for a minus sign.

1096
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:51,546
- Plus sign!
- Minus sign!

1097
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,584
I really don't want to get
soaked right now!

1098
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:58,417
- Just accept your fate.
- Why are you doing this to us now?

1099
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:04,181
[What will be the final result?]

1100
01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:12,631
[Team RM's sign is...]

1101
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,325
[Please Ji Hyo...]

1102
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:23,419
[Team RM's sign is... a plus!]

1103
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,220
[A celebration of joy,
and tear showers of sadness.]

1104
01:15:34,081 --> 01:15:38,299
[Chilled down to the bones.]

1105
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:41,432
[What a great feeling!]

1106
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,579
[Shocked out of their minds.]

1107
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:50,845
[We are... Shinhwa!]

1108
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,839
[With the mentality of idols,
bright and cheery to the very end!]

1109
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,813
[Real Man Competition-
Team RM wins!]

1110
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:00,632
We're ZE:A!

1111
01:16:01,544 --> 01:16:06,914
[Lady of Luck saves Team RM
with her selection!]

1112
01:16:06,915 --> 01:16:09,842

1113
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:13,391
[The seniors and the juniors of idol world
says their farewell in the icy shower.]

1114
01:16:13,392 --> 01:16:15,302
Can we start over from the beginning?

1115
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:18,881
[Can't stop the enthusiasm from
this group of real men!]

1116
01:16:18,882 --> 01:16:21,817
The winners will take home the gold!

1117
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:24,611
[The winners are awarded with gold badges.]

1118
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:31,044
[And another surprise event.]

1119
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:37,806
[A surprise birthday party for
February birthdays- Suk Jin, Gary, and Eric.]

1120
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:46,105
[Cheers to Shinhwa and ZE:A for
bringing their masculinity to the show!]
