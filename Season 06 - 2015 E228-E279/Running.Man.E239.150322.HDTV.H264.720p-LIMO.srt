00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
Another ten minutes in here.

177
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,940
[They don't want to admit it.]

178
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,300
Kwang Soo...

179
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,040
Who was your first love?

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,320
I think I was a high school student.

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,700
An older girl?

182
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,440
- It's always an older girl.
- You liked an older girl, too?

183
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,200
She's turning 60 soon.

184
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,780
[Are you well?]

185
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,600
[Haroro and Dong Hyun
fight with the rocks.]

186
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,840
- Please release my rope.
- Sure.

187
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,900
Try to raise your bottom.
Don't let your bottom stick out.

188
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,420
Get close to the wall.

189
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,100
[He climbs with his long arms.]

190
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,900
[Agent Haroro does his best.]

191
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,460
I think this is my limit!

192
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,600
I think I'm going to fall.

193
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,900
[He sure is the strongest guy!]

194
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,620
Dong Hyun!

195
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,400
- I got it!
- Dong Hyun!

196
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,690
I'll do everything if
you get mine, too.

197
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,890
- What are you going to do for me?
- Make you win.

198
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,300
Except that.

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
What do you want?

200
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,640
Are you going to hook
me up with a girl?

201
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,030
I'll give you my contact
on my phone.

202
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,520
- For real?
- For real!

203
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,230
I love you, Kim Dong Hyun!

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,240
[Then it's a deal.]

205
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,780
[He takes two lucky
bags and gets down.]

206
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,620
For real?

207
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,900
- I'll make sure to get you a woman.
- Don't forget.

208
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,600
- Kim Dong Hyun! Kim Dong Hyun!
[Secret keys acquired!]

209
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,900
[Namsan Tower]
- There are too many locks.

210
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,980
Was there a space to hook
another one?

211
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,320
Does anyone come back when
they break up with their lover.

212
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,340
Maybe they bring a cutter.

213
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,560
This is really tough.
How can I find it?

214
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,300
R!

215
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,120
- R?
['R lock' is right here.]

216
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,680
Oh! I found it!
How is it possible I found it?

217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,160
<i>What kind of a mission is this?</i>

218
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,340
[Ha Ha, Dong Hyun, and Jong Kook
acquire the secret key.]

219
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,120
- I saw a giraffe.
- That's nothing.

220
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,510
I think the rabbit is suspicious.

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,860
- The rabbit?
- Yes, that rabbit. Look!

222
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,660
Rabbit, wait!

223
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait, that person...
Shi Kyung!

224
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,960
[Let's pressed the siege.]
- See?

225
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,940
Come here.
Why is he doing this?

226
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,340
- He's here to exercise.
- Here it is.

227
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,480
- Here it is.
[They got it.]

228
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,100
But this is mine.

229
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>A red bag and a blue bag.</i>

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
<i>- Blue bag is mine.
- And red bag is mine.</i>

231
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
- What is it, then?
- Thank you.

232
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
Where do I need to go now?

233
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
- Wait!
[Agent Sung moves on.]

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,680
You should have told me.
- I'm leaving.

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,500
You didn't find it.

236
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,720
- I found what you found.
- I mean...

237
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
[Most of them are passive...]

238
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,100
Let me check.

239
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,080
[...but this sheep is actively blocking.]

240
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,800
Shi Kyung!
Wait!

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,480
- Shi Kyung!
[Give me it back!]

242
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,080
- He's not an average man.
[A strong sheep]

243
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,340
He's not the same sheep
from before.

244
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,360
Shi Kyung!

245
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,720
- Shi Kyung!
[Agent Sung comes back.]

246
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,700
This isn't the same sheep.

247
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,430
Seize him, Shi Kyung!

248
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,300
It's not him.
Here it is.

249
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,520
- I found it.
[Yoo Hyuk acquires the key.]

250
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,600
- Me, too.
[Agent Sung acquires the key.]

251
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,880
[Jae Suk and Shi Kyung
acquire the keys.]

252
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,380
How about 21?

253
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,610
Please!
[The eighth time riding it.]

254
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,900
I can't do it any more.

255
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,500
It has two boxes!

256
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,300
- What?
- Why two boxes?

257
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,640
There are two!

258
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,360
- Key!
- Key!

259
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
- Finally!
- Finally!

260
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,200
We can finally escape!

261
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,700
- I'm happier than when I won.
- We're finally done with this mission!

262
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,300
[But...]

263
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,100
[They still have to wait ten minutes.]
- To get this key, I...

264
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,000
had to go through the hell.

265
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
We still have to stay in
the gondola.

266
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Ah... that's right.

267
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm cold!

268
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,880
[They were happy for a second.]

269
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,840
[They're depressed all of a sudden.]

270
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,420
[Everyone has succeeded at
acquiring their secret keys.]

271
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,630
[The Dark Night's temporary station.]

272
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,700
- What's the matter?
- Why so quiet?

273
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,100
- Hello!
- Hello!

274
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,180
- Night errand boys regular meeting?
- Hello!

275
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,500
Wow, regular meeting!

276
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,900
- Ji Hyo and Gary came!
- You're here, Ji Hyo.

277
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,960
Welcome to the night errand
boys' regular meeting.

278
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,800
- It's Jong Kook.
- You didn't want to catch a cold.

279
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,000
[He's wearing a muffler.]

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,060
- It's been cold.
- Why are you coming alone?

281
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,620
- I was by myself.
- You were? Really?

282
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,200
Why am I the only one?

283
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
You're here, Ha Ha.

284
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,900
What? Dong Hyun is here!

285
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,620
[Everyone is surprised
to see the UFC fighter.]

286
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,420
You're lucky, Ha Ha.

287
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,580
[The strongest night
errand boy, Dong Hyun.]

288
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,550
Please throw Jong Kook for me.

289
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,800
- Where were you today?
- We were rock climbing.

290
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
Were you able to do it?

291
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,520
That's why Dong Hyun helped...

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
- He did it for you?
- Yes.

293
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,960
You're still using honorifics with him?

294
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,060
How can I not?

295
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,540
He usually starts speaking
informal quickly.

296
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,800
- It's so cold.
- Hello!

297
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,020
[Jae Suk and Shi Kyung arrive last.]

298
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,940
- Shi Kyung!
- What brings you here?

299
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,970
I thought you're were
Jo Young Nam.

300
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,020
[He imitates him right away.]

301
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,100
What's the occasion?

302
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
- Hello!
- Hello!

303
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,780
What's with him?

304
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,660
Are you a pervert?
What are you?

305
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,700
[Everybody's judging his trench coat.]

306
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,680
You look awful today.

307
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,820
It's for my persona.

308
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,420
I think I have a chance
besides Dong Hyun.

309
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,500
- What are you talking about?
- Shi Kyung is really strong!

310
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,800
- You don't know anything about Shi Kyung.
[ I take it back.]

311
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,160
<i>So, all of you acquired
the secret keys?</i>

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,300
Yes!

313
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,780
We don't greet each other
or anything?

314
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,410
The whole nation knows
you're Sung Shi Kyung.

315
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,220
We don't catch up on our lives?
We start being night errand boys?

316
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,480
I think you've been in
the studios too much.

317
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,620
What is there to catch up on?

318
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,860
We see each other,
then we know we're alive.

319
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,900
No need for that.

320
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,320
- We're all well.
- I understand.

321
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,140
<i>I'll announce today's race first.</i>

322
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,900
<i>It's the 'Hunter of the Key' race.</i>

323
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,700
<i>I'm offering the final
mission for you guys.</i>

324
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,000
<i>When you succeed this mission</i>

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,760
<i>you will get a huge dividend</i>

326
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,880
<i>and live in luxury.</i>

327
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,300
<i>To complete this mission</i>

328
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,800
<i>the secret keys you
acquires are critical.</i>

329
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,090
[The secret key is critical!]

330
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,000
<i>Before we start our final mission</i>

331
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
<i>we'll give you another chance
at getting an additional key.</i>

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
<i>Do you have any questions?</i>

333
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,800
We don't catch up on
each other lives?

334
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
[Curious Shi Kyung]

335
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Just say what you want to say
in front of the camera.

336
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
It's been a long time.
I'm his fan.

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,700
I didn't release a new album.
I'm not here to promote anything.

338
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,860
<i>Then you'll do another mission
to get an additional key.</i>

339
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>It's the race for the key.</i>

340
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Race?

341
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,800
<i>We made a track shaped like a key.
Three runners will start.</i>

342
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:16,000
<i>Pick a person from each
zone and go to that person.</i>

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,200
<i>Throw the person down and
pop the balloon underneath.</i>

344
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,360
<i>And come to the finish line.</i>

345
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,300
<i>Then the first one to
finish is the winner.</i>

346
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,680
<i>There will be three rounds,
so three winners...</i>

347
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,300

<i>Yes. It's an individual battle.</i>

350
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,120
My main skill is to block and throw.

I think Dong Hyun will come to me.

368
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,800
I want to stand in the middle,
because it's less painful when falling.

369
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,900
- That's not nice!
- Are you going to punch?

370

Wow, Jong Kook held out!

523
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,040
- Good job!
- He blocked him.

524
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,840
He didn't win this race!

525
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,500
- Incredible.
[He feels sorry for Dong Hyun.]

526
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,600
It's better for us, if
Ji Hyo gets the key.

527
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,220
What if Ji Hyo wins the race?

528
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,160
[I'll see you at the final mission.]

529
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,620
<i>Song Ji Hyo is the winner</i>

530
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,140
<i>so she can have another key.</i>

531
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,600
I hope she'll get your number.

532
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,220
- What number...
- We can check each other's number, right?

533
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,080
Ji Hyo never loses a big game.

534
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,620
She always gets this kind of stuff.

535
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,000
I didn't expect her to get it.

536
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,380
- No, Shi Kyung helped me.
- Here's the key.

537
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,220
- You're getting it?
- I can see the number.

538
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,920
You saw it again.

539
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,700
- How can I possibly see it?
- You saw it!

540
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
With your hawk eyes!

541
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,180
[Ji Hyo gets additional key number seven.
What are the secrets of these keys?]

542
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,760
[Soon, the secret of the
key will be revealed.]

543
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,800
[A battle of wits to get the key.]

544
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,100
[And the plot twist!]

545
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,280
[Who will be the winner in the end?]

546
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,880
<i>What's this all about?</i>

547
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
<i>- He talks like you.
- Why do you talk like me?</i>

548
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,540
- I really don't know what it is.
- Are you taking us again?

549
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,400
- Again?
- We've just met!

550
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
- What is it?
- Not again!

551
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,850
- I'm lonely.
- Just follow them.

552
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,640
I've done nothing wrong.

553
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,200
Why don't you take Ji Hyo?

554
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
[The special mission for
the key hunters is...]

555
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,700
<i>Night errand boys, I'll
announce the final mission.</i>

556
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Is this the final mission already?

557
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:23,660
<i>The final mission is
'Maximize your dividend.'</i>

558
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,000
<i>From now on...</i>

559
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,100
<i>try and maximize your dividend.</i>

560
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,000
Why did you have to...
Is it a golden hand?

561
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,120
Thank you.
We start with one gold.

562
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,000
We need to multiple it in order
to win.

563
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,520
So is this the dividend?

564
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,100
<i>To maximize your dividend</i>

565
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,200
<i>using the secret keys you acquired</i>

566
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,080
<i>you should find a locker and open it.</i>

567
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,900
<i>- A locker?
[36 lockers are in this building.]</i>

568
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,960
<i>All of the lockers are locked.</i>

569
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,100
<i>Each locker has two locks.</i>

570
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,500
<i>Unlock one of the locks first.</i>

571
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,120
<i>Then you'll be able to get a hint about the
person who has the key for the other lock.</i>

572
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
I need to find another person.

573
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:29,300
<i>Find the person and open
the locker together.</i>

574
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,500
<i>Then you'll find a beneficial card
for maximizing your dividends.</i>

575
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,720
Is there a hint about
how I can maximize?

576
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,800
<i>The more you open, the
more you'll earn.</i>

577
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
<i>After certain amount of time</i>

578
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,240
<i>the exchange shop will open, and you can
exchange your coins with real money.</i>

579
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,500
<i>The one with the most
money is today's winner.</i>

580
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,000
Someone might come for my key.

581
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,200
<i>- I'm excited?
- We'll start the final mission now.</i>

582
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,300
<i>Ten, nine, eight</i>

583
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,120
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

584
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,320
<i>- four, three...
- This is my day!</i>

585
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,180
<i>two, one!</i>

586
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,600
[The Dark Night's final mission is
to maximize the dividends.]

587
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,680
<i>Where is the locker?</i>

588
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,300
<i>Find a locker for my key.
I have to find the locker quickly.</i>

589
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,400
It's open.
I think there's one.

590
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Is there none?

591
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,480
Yes, there is!
This is great!

592
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,360
It feels like I'm playing a game.

593
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,400
[Open!]
- What is this?

594
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,740
This would have been too easy
if it opened.

595
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,380
[He uses his height for a trick?]

596
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,320
[The hunter who has an advantage.]
- I have number one...

597
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,000
and number seven.

598
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,900
I have two keys.

599
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:08,060
Although I'm weak,
I guess I have an advantage.

600
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,020
It's right there!

601
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,160
[She can open it by herself if the
locker has the same two numbers.]

602
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,120
[Number one key...]

603
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
[Number one key fails.]
- No.

604
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,980
[Number seven key...]

605
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,940
[Number seven key fails.]

606
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,580
[While she's focusing on
looking for a locker...]

607
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,060
[Two hunters are watching
other hunters' movements.]

608
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,700
[Quickly find the locker!]

609
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
It's not in here?

610
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,780
[Shi Kyung runs for a while.]

611
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,160
This is fun!
I like it!

612
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,600
[He finds another one.]
Criminals...

613
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,920
Because we're doing this
in a closed building.

614
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,620
I feel like I'm here to
get some information.

615
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,280
[It's finally opened!]

616
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,740
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

617
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,120
Then it's 'The Sixth Sense.'

618
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,100
Six!

619
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,400
Okay.

620
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,080
What floor is this?
It's sixth floor.

621
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,840
It's the sixth floor, right?

622
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,200
[Jae Suk finally finds a locker.]

623
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,840
[Bingo!]

624
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,120
[What's the hint for the other lock?]
- A swan?

625
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,620
A swan...

626
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,000
Seriously...

627
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,900
That looks like number 2.

628
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,460
A swan means number two.
You didn't know I would solve it.

629
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,640
[If I can find a hunter
with the key number two!]

630
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,260
- Number 1.
- You have number 1?

631
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,060
- I'm looking for it.
- Aren't you 8?

632
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,240
Did you open?

633
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,040
- What's yours?
- What's your number?

634
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,200
Don't you have number 2?

635
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,800
- You have 2, right?
- Did you find the lock?

636
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,700
You have number 2.
Follow me.

637
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,640
- Why didn't you answer me?
- Tell me now.

638
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,560
[What's in the locker?]

639
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,400
This is it!
A swan.

640
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,520
[Jae Suk opens the lock.]
A swan!

641
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,940
Try opening it.

642
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,600
[Baek Bum - Kim Goo's pen name.]
- Kim Goo (nine).

643
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,660
[They open the locker.]

644
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,240
Choose one of the envelopes.

645
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,040
- One is beneficial...
- What is this?

646
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
[And the other is empty.]

647
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,400
You can pick the card
the way you want.

648
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,820
What is this?

649
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,060
So, you chose that one?

650
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,640
- Can I use my physical strength?
- Don't do it that way.

651
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,000
[He's ready to use his
fighter's skill.]

652
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,670
Do you want to switch?

653
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,820
Go ahead, please.
Choose one first.

654
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,880
- I want that one.
- This one?

655
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,500
- Here it is.
- Why are you holding two?

656
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,100
[It's either the golden card or empty.]

657
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,040
[Empty!]

658
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,260
[Why did I switch...]

659
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,140
- Multiply by three!
- What?

660
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,440
Thank you, Dong Hyun!

661
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,900
<i>Three times as much!
Three times!</i>

662
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm so sorry, Dong Hyun.

663
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,100
What you chose was the right one.

664
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,200
- Yours is empty, right?
- No, it's not.

665
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Wait, I'll read this to you.

666
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,920
[What is he doing?]

667
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,940
- Wait, I'll read this to you.
[There's another mission?]

668
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,900
[You can eliminate other
member's name tags.]

669
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,500
[Then the dividend will be transferred but
their keys and golden keys will lapse.]

670
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,170
[You can eliminate and
take their dividend?]

671
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,180
- Wait!
- You wait.

672
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
You wait, Dong Hyun.

673
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,000
[It's the happiest moment for him.]

674
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,900
[Jae Suk stayed in heaven
for three seconds.]

675
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,000
What are you guys doing?
Wait, Dong Hyun.

676
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,400
- Is it okay if I read it out loud?
- Wait.

677
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,600
You can't lose this bag.

678
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,520
Wait, Dong Hyun!

679
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,840
- This is not the time to eliminate.
- Is that so?

680
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,600
Can you tell me why?

681
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,500
Now?

682
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,100
When I don't do that...

683
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,660
This guy is...

684
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,080
playing this game in a hurry...

685
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm very competitive.

686
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,490
Once I grab, I won't let it go.

687
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,700
- This is not a good time.
- Is that it?

688
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,160
Let's leave here first.

689
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,700
Why did you switch with me?

690
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,100
- Your name tag is on, right?
[He never loses his prey.]

691
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,340
- Then see you later.
- See you.

692
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,200
You're the richest person.

693
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
You don't know it yet.

694
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,950
- You go this way, and I'll go this way.
- Okay.

695
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,440
- Thank you, Dong Hyun.
- Sure.

696
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
I almost died there.

697
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,420
You scared me!
Why did you do that?

698
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
[I'm letting you go this time.]

699
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,930
Three times!

700
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,400
[He gets three gold coins.]

701
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,700
I think I can use him.

702
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,180
[Make a lot of money.
See you later.]

703
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,740
[No.5 Suk Jin and No.1 Ji Hyo]

704
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,060
Choose one of the envelopes...

705
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,380
One is...
[Getting the golden key card is crucial.]

706
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Ladies first.

707
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,000
What do you want to pick?
Can you give me that one?

708
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,600
- You pick well.
- Take this.

709
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,830
- You want that one?
- No.

710
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,500
No? You want this one?
Then I'll take it.

711
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,830
<i>I'll go somewhere else and check.</i>

712
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,000
Did you open any?

713
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,170
- Yes, we opened one.
- Both of you?

714
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,700
- Really? Wow!
- Yes.

715
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,400
I feel so weird.
This is crazy.

716
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,600
[Empty]

717
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,100
<i>Empty!</i>

718
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,400
[His headache starts with this letter.]
- My head hurts.

719
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Wow, Song Ji Hyo is
truly a lucky person.

720
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,030
[Queen of the Draw, Ji Hyo wins
even if she gives it away.]

721
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,760
[She acquires the doubling card.]

722
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,000
Double!

723
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,780
Double?

724
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,760
[Total two coins.]

725
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,900
Wow, that's great!

726
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,910
I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

727
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,320
[Will the Queen of the Draw
win this game?]

728
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,300
[Current status of the R coins.]

729
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,050
[Jae Suk has three coins now.]

730
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,580
[Running Man]
- What does 'Running Man' mean?

731
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,500
There's another locker.

732
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,480
[He's collecting the hints.]

733
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,970
Jupiter?

734
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,540
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter...
That's number five.

735
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
[He guesses the hints easily.]

736
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,160
Hodori (mascot for the '88 Olympics),
eight!

737
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,100
[He comes to the front.]

738
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,900
[Brain Shi Kyung guesses easily.]
- Fifth consonant, five!

739
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,040
[No.4 Kwang Soo and No. 7 Gary]
- I need to see this.

740
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,220
- You saw it, didn't you?
- No, I really didn't.

741
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,730
Then switch.

742
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,480
[Dud]

743
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,490
[Ah... I never should've swapped.]

744
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,820
[Earn 5 times the amount.]

745
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,220
Five times!

746
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:26,460
[Gary's current count - Five]

747
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,860
[Meanwhile, the muscle rivals,
Mr. Capable, and Dong Hyun...]

748
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,210
- That must've been your number.
- Then that must've been your number, too.

749
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,350
[Jong Kook- Six; Dong Hyun- Two.
The locker is opened.]

750
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,360
[They each grab a golden envelope.]

751
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,130
Dud!

752
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,850
Times three!

753
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,880
[Dong Hyun finds the 'Times Three' card.]

754
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,090
[Dong Hyun's current count- Three.]

755
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,670
I would've had six if I had
found this when I had two coins.

756
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,090
[You can start to eliminate
others' name tags.]

757
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,310
[But the key, and the coins they possess
will be eliminated along with them.]

758
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,940
[Should I get on the move, and
start eliminating some name tags?]

759
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,090
- Ji Hyo, what do you think we should do?
- What do you mean?

760
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,150
- Let's get one figured out.
- Okay, since I already owe you one.

761
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,840
Just tell me one of the numbers.
If it's right, then we'll open it together.

762
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,830
- Have you already opened one?
- Yes, I've already opened one.

763
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,660
Then let me ask you one.
Seven.

764
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,300
- I know who number seven is.
- Tell me who it is.

765
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,350
You're not going to tell anyone else?
You have to promise me.

766
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,160
[I wonder who it could be...]

767
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,280
- I'm number seven.
- Ugh, you're so annoying.

768
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,580
- I'm serious.
- I'm not doing this filthy show anymore.

769
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,820
[You can't trust anyone
in this world...]

770
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,680
On our show, you can't share
information like that with anyone else.

771
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,310
But know that I'm in hiding because
there's someone with a duplicate number.

772
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,890
- Someone with a duplicate number?
- I have two numbers right now, right?

773
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,750
I already know who has the same number.
You need the number seven, right?

774
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,910
Are you going by yourself right now?

775
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,250
- You haven't opened a single one yet?
- I just want to open one.

776
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,190
Where did it go?
I think it's right here.

777
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,750
[Will Shi Kyung's eight, and Ji Hyo's seven
open up this locker?]

778
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,360
[The locker is successfully opened.]

779
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,120
[Now it's time to make their selection.]

780
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,290
I've already opened one earlier,
so you can take your pick first.

781
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,720
Really? Then I'm going
to go with this one.

782
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,060
Shi Kyung, let's open them up
by ourselves.

783
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,350
[Ji Hyo flees the scene in fear of
Shi Kyung coming after her name tag.]

784
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,110
Then it means I can't open
anymore lockers with number seven?

785
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,620
[Blank Ji finds herself with a chance
to double her current amount.]

786
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,600
[The first locker Shi Kyung opens,
and he automatically ends up with a dud.]

787
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,940
Double!

788
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,420
[2 x 2= Four.]

789
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,850
I'm not sure if having these coins
is necessarily a good thing.

790
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,400
[Ha Ha is still frantically searching
for his first locker.]

791
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,360
[Finds his first locker.]

792
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:35,590
[Successfully opens the first lock.
What number is the other lock?]

793
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,840
[Turbo, Leessang, Bi-Bi.]

794
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,220
Okay, that's number two!
That means it's Dong Hyun.

795
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,790
[Wait... he knows that
Dong Hyun is number two?]

796
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,560
- Let's tell each other our numbers.
- Our numbers?

797
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,470
- Let's be honest, okay?
- Okay.

798
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,080
We'll just have you come in at first place.
First place is the way to go.

799
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,840
[Thus, Ha Ha (three) finds out that
Dong Hyun is number two?]

800
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,170
How were we supposed to find this
when they hid it all the way in here?

801
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,050
- It's not opening.
- You're number two, aren't you?

802
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,890
[The excitement of the lock opening
can be felt through the fingertips.]

803
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,040
I finally got one opened.

804
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,330
The one on the right was a dud earlier,
so this time, I'm going to pick this one.

805
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,200
[Early bird gets the worm!
Dong Hyun snatches up the card he wants.]

806
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,870
- We each get one?
- Is this your first locker?

807
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,340
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
get going now.

808
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,270
[Anyone can tell that Dong Hyun
is happy with what he just saw.]

809
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,710
[Ha Ha gets a dud
from the first locker he opens.]

810
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,110
Double!

811
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,760
- Thank you.
[3 x 2 = Six.]

812
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,630
- How many lockers have you opened?
- Me?

813
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,800
- I've only opened one locker.
- Me, too, and it was a dud.

814
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,090
- There's one in there.
- Where? In here?

815
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,960
- Wait for me. Let's look for one together.
- You've really opened only one?

816
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,500
- I'm serious, I've only found one.
- It's to your left.

817
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,980
- You've only got one, and it was a dud?
- Yes, it was a total dud.

818
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,630
Mine was a dud, too.
Did it open?

819
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,950
Yeah.
Did it open for you, too?

820
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,950
If you can open it, then do it now.
Are you number six?

821
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,300
Wow, this is crazy!
I had no idea that it'd be you!

822
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,070
- I don't know about this.
- What's in here?

823
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,900
[A celebratory dance for these duds!
One of them will get the golden envelope!]

824
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,290
- Do you want to switch?
- No.

825
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,620
- No? I didn't know you were number six.
- I don't want to switch.

826
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,990
- I didn't know your number either.
- Let's stick together, okay?

827
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,110
[Jong Kook ends up with the dud.]

828
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,330
[It's another dud, but I still can't
seem to stop from laughing.]

829
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,730
Double!

830
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,320
- Double!
[Rubbing it in.]

831
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,210
Thank you.

832
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,530
[Ha Ha- 1 x 2 = Two.]

833
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:24,150
Dong Hoon, I only have one right now
because I've only been getting duds.

834
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,100
So I think that I'm going to
have to take yours.

835
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:32,650
- What are you talking about?
- I can't just let you go right now.

836
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,190
I'll pay you back if I win the race.
I'm serious, I'll pay you back.

837
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,750
- I promise.
[No wonder he kindly led me in here.]

838
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,890
- I'm leaving.
- No, you cant.

839
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,740
[Rendered helpless.]

840
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,970
- Are you going to eliminate me?
- I promise that I'll pay you back.

841
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,320
- You can't eliminate me for a while.
- Yes, of course.

842
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,950
[I'll let you live.]

843
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,950
Even if I don't eliminate you right now...

844
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,560
Come on, just hand it over.

845
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,670
I finally have two coins.
Thanks.

846
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,610
- You seriously can't touch me, okay?
- Okay, I got it.

847
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,750
I promise.
I'm telling you that I won't touch you.

848
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,690
Be careful walking around, okay?
Do you see how worried I am about you?

849
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,030
[You'd better watch your back...]

850
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,740
[I vow to get my revenge...]

851
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,080
[Thus, Jong Kook successfully
gets himself another coin.]

852
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,750
[Another dud, Kwang Soo,
is purposely headed somewhere.]

853
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,280
- Have you tried this one?
- No, not this one.

854
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,340
[Giraffe is led to a locker in the
corner by Dong Hyun's lead.]

855
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,580
[It opened!]

856
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,670
[It's now time to make their selection.]

857
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,990
What is it?

858
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,920
It's a dud.
Why are there so many duds?

859
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,410
[He certainly lives up to his name.]

860
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,000
Why don't you open yours?

861
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,810
[Then mine has to be the good card...]

862
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,760
Why would they put this card in here?
I've been running around here for hours.

863
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,350
- What is it?
- Forfeiture of rights.

864
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,710
- What does that mean?
- It means to confiscate.

865
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,250
All the additional chips that you've earned
will be confiscated from you. (Minimum of 1.)

866
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,690
- Give me all the chips that you've earned.
- Yes!

867
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,740
[Hand over all the chips that
you've worked so hard to earn.]

868
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,250
I love duds!

869
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,930
I've been picking duds all day!

870
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,020
[His coin stash is
automatically reset to one.]

871
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,750
Dong Hyun, I'm going to go now,
and look for Jae Suk.

872
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,860
Since I just got this dud.

873
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,730
- How many do you have right now?
- I have two.

874
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,700
I only have two right now,
so there's no point in eliminating me.

875
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,670
But having two is better than
what I've got.

876
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,760
- Those are some hurtful words!
- Two is better than the one I have!

877
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,800
- What are you saying?
- Then just give me one.

878
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,410
I can give you one, but you're
acting like a thug right now.

879
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,650
- There are still lots of lockers left.
- Then just give me one.

880
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,970
- Do you want to lose two, or just one?
- What the heck is this?

881
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,470
- Do you want to lose two, or just one?
- If I have to choose, then I'll choose one.

882
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,490
Give it to me while I'm still being nice.

883
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,510
[Please don't keep that innocent smile on
your face while saying those types of words.]

884
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,830
- Dong Hyun.
- Hi, Jong Kook.

885
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,790
[I'd like to wish you a joyous,
and a fruitful hunting experience.]

886
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,310
Enjoy!

887
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,590
- Should I finish it off?
- Sure! Have fun!

888
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,610
- Happy hunting!
- No need to say things like that.

889
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,030
It's like there are two Kim Jong Kook's.

890
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,540
- Thank you. I'll work even harder now.
- Yes, of course.

891
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,240
[I will make sure to
put this coin to good use.]

892
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,850
If I run into you again, then
I'll have to attempt an elimination.

893
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:14,230
- Please consider the help I just gave you.
- Okay, thanks.

894
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,860
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

895
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,790
Even if I can't win the race today, I vow
to eliminate his name tag from the game.

896
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:24,370
[You just wait and see,
Kim Dong Hyun...]

897
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,870
Is it okay to take this from
him like this?

898
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,780
[You were fine earlier, so what
are you having doubts about now?]

899
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,190
I actually think that
this is a better method.

900
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,120
- Jae Suk.
- Are you number five?

901
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,660
- This is too hard for me.
- But are you opening up a lot of lockers?

902
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,350
Jae Suk, let's open one together.

903
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,640
Okay, let's find one and
open it together.

904
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,350
Let's go find one, and open it together.

905
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,650
Teach me how to play, and give me some
tips. You guys are awful to your guests.

906
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,670
- What are you talking about?
- No one's telling me anything.

907
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,780
I've been running around
all over this building.

908
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,280
I thought that I was forbidden from using
the elevator since this is 'Running Man'.

909
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Why wouldn't you? You should
take the elevator when you can.

910
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,560
- Then that would be 'Elevator Man'.
- What are you talking about?

911
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,550
[Off to the elevators
on their search for the lockers.]

912
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,830
[A locker is found!]

913
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,780
[Attempting to open
both the locks by herself?]

914
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:31,560
[Blank Ji with both number one, and seven,
boldly attempts to open the locks by herself.]

915
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,400
[The number seven key is a winner.]

916
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,720
[Will the number one key also be a winner?]

917
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,800
This is awesome.
So awesome.

918
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,010
[Who knew that my keys would
open both of these locks?]

919
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,740
This is awesome.

920
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,880
Did you open it?

921
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,600
Did you open it?

922
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,290
[What tangible fate between these two.
Mr. Gary makes his entrance.]

923
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,970
I have two keys.

924
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,050
- Then can I get one of these?
- No, you can't.

925
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,290
- Why not?
- You have to open the lock on your own.

926
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,990
And make sure to keep this in mind.
My two keys doesn't mean I get two lives.

927
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,210
- You only have one life, right?
- Yes, I only have one life.

928
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,210
My elimination would mean
that two keys will also be eliminated.

929
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,080
Then can you help me
open one of these lockers?

930
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,400
[Then he's going to find out
that I also have a number seven key.]

931
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,800
- I'm going to do this first.
[Turns down his proposal.]

932
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:46,330
[I need to remain extremely cautious.]

933
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,770
I seriously can't figure it out.

934
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,170
[Why doesn't anyone want my
number seven?]

935
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,210
[Ji Hyo gets a chance to double
her amount.]

936
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,340
Double!

937
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,750
- Thank you.
[4 x 2= Eight.]

938
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,760
[Ta-da!
A locker is opened.]

939
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,280
- That one? Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

940
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,760
Are you sure that you
won't regret it?

941
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:31,010
[Gary with five vs Jae Suk with three.
A fierce mental battle.]

942
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,090
- Yes!
- Yes!

943
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,380
[Wait, did they both get
the chance card?]

944
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,380
I got a key card, too.

945
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,210
<i>Dud.</i>

946
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,740
Ugh, it's a dud!

947
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,640
[Gary was completely fooled
by the picture of the key.]

948
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,370
Double!

949
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,750
- Is this because I started off with three?
[3 x 2 = Six.]

950
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,480
- Is it right?
- Yes, I think this one is right.

951
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,920
[Grasshopper finally gets the hang of it,
and gets himself on a roll.]

952
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,910
- Double.
[6 x 2 = 12.]

953
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,590
- We won't know until we open it.
[But it isn't over yet!]

954
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:17,290
- There was one here?
- You were number one?

955
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,240
- Double!
[His winning streak takes him up to 24.]

956
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,590
[But Brain Sung attempts to give
the Grasshopper a run for his money.]

957
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,320
[Chases after the Grasshopper through
the use of deduction, and statistics.]

958
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,320
[Shi Kyung- 2 x 2 = Four.]

959
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,970
[I'm the one that'll
bring down the Grasshopper.]

960
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,170
[And almost immediately
opens up another locker.]

961
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,590
- Triple.
[4 x 3 = 12.]

962
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:48,640
[Finds a triple card before he even
gets a chance to take a breath!]

963
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,470
[Surpasses the Grasshopper, and
jumps to the current lead with 36.]

964
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:01,940
- Kwang Soo, let's go.
- Dong Hoon.

965
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,580
[The two coin donors gathers
to join their forces together.]

966
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,520
- Kwang Soo, do you have a lot?
- No, I only have one.

967
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,580
I had all of mine taken away from me.
I had no idea Dong Hyun would be like that.

968
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,990
Dong Hyun kept tempting me
to eliminate him in the elevator.

969
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,670
I opened a locker with Dong Hyun,
and I got another dud

970
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,010
and Dong Hyun got a forfeiture card.

971
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,140
The he wagged his finger at me,
and told me to come closer.

972
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,110
Let's go, Kwang Soo. I don't
even have a single coin right now.

973
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,130
- You don't even have one? I have one.
- No, I don't even have a single one.

974
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,180
This is a total lawless country,
or something.

975
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,140
- Do they know what century this is?
- The rules are in place for a reason!

976
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,820
Shouldn't the writers, and the producers,
step in and do something about this?

977
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,150
- Don't you think they're crossing the line?
- They need to be locked up behind bars.

978
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:56,410
Do you think that they're
better than us or something?

979
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,240
[The two herbivores' voices have
become louder as a team.]

980
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,820
What? Electroless innocence?
(Play on words)

981
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,280
I meant, separation of law
for the rich and the poor!

982
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:10,600
[The two herbivores set out together
in search for the lockers.]

983
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,020
[Dud]

984
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,560
[Hello, my name is 'Dud-Soo'.]

985
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,230
No, don't cry.

986
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,330
Wow.

987
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,240
[The current status of everyone's
standing will be revealed to you.]

988
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:35,460
[Knowing the current standing means
that I can target the winner's name tags!]

989
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,740
Let's just go for the one
that's in front of us.

990
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,920
[Even the Grasshopper, and the Tiger
are attempting to work together.]

991
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,870
- Where are you going?
- Why?

992
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,200
[The Grasshopper instinctively
attempts to flee for his survival.]

993
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,970
Wait, this is...

994
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,740
What is it?

995
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,180
Let's just tell each other.
Is it just coins?

996
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,130
[Jae Suk wins a chance to double
his amount.]

997
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,260
- Mine is a dud.
- Really?

998
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,970
[I have to flee in order to survive.]

999
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,650
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1000
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:14,950
[Since the Grasshopper isn't so easy,
let's just wait off on that for a bit.]

1001
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,530
I should just monitor everyone first,
then figure out what to do from there.

1002
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,830
[Barely escapes with his life.]

1003
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,260
I feel nervous about this.
I don't think I want to have this many.

1004
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,060
[Jumps to the lead with a total of 48 coins.]

1005
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,980
[Ha Ha is being told the current status
of everyone's standing.]

1006
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,670
Yoo Jae Suk has 48.

1007
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,950
Sung Shi Kyung has 36.

1008
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:46,560
Gary has 15, and Song Ji Hyo
has eight.

1009
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,880
Ji Suk Jin has six.

1010
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:55,940
Kim Jong Kook has four,
and Kim Dong Hyun has two.

1011
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,050
Lee Kwang Soo, and Ha Ha...
only have one each.

1012
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,570
- Ha Ha, do you know the count?
- It's frightening.

1013
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:13,090
- What does it look like?
- You and I are on the same boat today!

1014
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,250
You little scoundrel... I thought
you were hiding something from me.

1015
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,330
I told you that I only had one.
I'm serious, we're in this together today.

1016
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,770
- Sit down, and let's talk this out.
- Do you really have nothing?

1017
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,990
You need to know this much.

1018
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:31,510
You need to know this.
The current first place...

1019
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,760
has 48 coins.

1020
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,370
- Okay, you have to decide.
- Is it possible to have 48?

1021
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,510
Yes, it must be possible.
Want to partner up with me?

1022
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,790
- Yes, of course.
- Winning this isn't the issue for me anymore.

1023
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:50,620
- If we don't get these 48 coins...
- Then it's all over for us already.

1024
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,430
[Team Herbivore is now
Team Anti-48.]

1025
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,340
- Wait, but you haven't told me who it is.
- That's our safety net.

1026
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:07,220
[Meanwhile, 48 is clueless about
his identity having been compromised.]

1027
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,900
Ha Ha.

1028
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,210
[Of all places,
to get off the elevator here...]

1029
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,080
- You've had a lot taken away, too, right?
- Yes, I have.

1030
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,830
You're the last hope I have
to open the locker on the third floor.

1031
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,600
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

1032
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,300
- How's it going with you?
[Jae Suk can't be the one with 48, can he?]

1033
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,180
- Don't lie to me!
- I only have one. How many do you have?

1034
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,580
- Hey...
- Be honest with me.

1035
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,430
- Let's talk once we're on the third floor.
- How many do you have?

1036
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,180
Let's just talk
once we're on the third floor.

1037
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,540
[The two are in a mental cat and mouse game,
with the Giraffe as the third wheel.]

1038
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,950
Hey, if everyone had been open
about our numbers from the beginning

1039
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,580
then we wouldn't have to
fumble around like this.

1040
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,170
- Kwang Soo, where did you hide your coins?
- I seriously only have one.

1041
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,170
Stop lying to me, and just
be honest with me.

1042
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:58,510
I'm telling you the truth. Dong Hoon
knows everyone's current standing.

1043
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:01,200
He also knows how many coins we all have.
Do you know how many first place has?

1044
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,140
No, I don't know.

1045
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,160
This is a secret, but 48.

1046
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,660
[An explosion of fake acting.]

1047
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,460
[Dud for luck, and dud for brains-
Giraffe is just striking out left and right.]

1048
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,460
[In total acting mode.]

1049
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,760
Double that would be 96.

1050
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,810
I wonder who has the 48 coins.

1051
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,010
- It's not you, is it?
- You know better than that.

1052
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,530
[Trying to appease Kwang Soo,
and tells him that he's been hitting duds.]

1053
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:35,080
- Let's not be like this to each other.
- You don't have anything either?

1054
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,530
No, I don't.

1055
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,340
But why don't I hear anything about
Ha Ha getting ousted yet?

1056
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:47,310
[I know I told Ha Ha exactly
where to go...]

1057
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,790
I will tell you everyone's
current standing.

1058
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,510
[Haroro, in grave danger.]

1059
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,510
Here, I'll show you the current standing,
and tell you why you shouldn't eliminate me.

1060
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,710
[Offering whatever he can to help
preserve the survival of his own life.]

1061
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:05,250
See? Jae Suk is in first place.
Eliminate him, and you'd take over his spot.

1062
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,420
- You're going to help me?
- Eliminate him, and take over his spot.

1063
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,200
- Okay?
- Should we go downstairs?

1064
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,150
[Ha Ha and Dong Hyun join forces
to eliminate Jae Suk.]

1065
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:18,350
- It's okay, Kwang Soo. Don't be scared.
- Why do you keep showing up everywhere?

1066
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,210
- I was just heading downstairs.
- No, you can come with us.

1067
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,690
- The three of us together?
- I'll pin down his arms.

1068
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,980
I think Jae Suk just went into
the bathroom.

1069
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:34,890
- You have to promise that we're a team.
- I'll show you how sincere I am.

1070
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,670
- But you don't even have anything.
- I have one.

1071
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:41,710
- So there's no use in eliminating you.
- I have two.

1072
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,580
- How many does Jae Suk have?
- Dong Hyun knows how many Jae Suk has.

1073
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:50,210
I've already told you how many. But
don't say that we're the ones who did it.

1074
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,780
We'll just support you in your cause.
There he is.

1075
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,450
[Just the person they've been looking for!]

1076
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,960
[Attacked as soon as he's found.]

1077
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,700
I've been told the current standing,
and he's in first place.

1078
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,770
- You have 48?
- No, it's not me.

1079
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:08,190
- You're the one with 48?
- Yes, he is.

1080
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,430
I have no doubt about it.
I've been told everyone's current count.

1081
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:14,640
[The Grasshopper is caught
between a rock, and a hard place.]

1082
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,840
- Come on.
- Rip!

1083
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,600
[The sound of absolute terror.]

1084
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,030
[The person to eliminate Jae Suk
will gain his 48 coins.]

1085
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,890
No, you can't do this to me.

1086
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,610
[Whomever that eliminates Jae Suk
will jump into the leading spot.]

1087
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,460
No, you can't do this to me.

1088
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,040
[Kwang Soo eliminates Ha Ha's name tag!]

1089
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,250
[What the heck just happened?]

1090
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:52,380
Lee Kwang Soo, seriously...
You're not even a human being!

1091
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,530
- Wow, seriously!
- Please listen to me!

1092
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,290
[Dong Hyun, and Kwang Soo vs Jae Suk.]

1093
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,870
- You have too many!
- You have to eliminate Kwang Soo.

1094
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:06,320
- You seriously have to eliminate him.
- Dong Hyun, get rid of Kwang Soo!

1095
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,550
[Alert the sound on Kwang Soo's betrayal!]

1096
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,480
[What the heck is this kid doing?]

1097
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:24,510
[The repeated moments of utter
humiliation throughout the mission.]

1098
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,410
[You have shamed, and humiliated me.]

1099
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:36,240
[I will repay you for all the humiliation
that you've given me.]

1100
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,430
This is the only chance I have!

1101
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,330
[Dong Hyun eliminates Jae Suk's name tag!]

1102
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,920
[It's now one on one.
Kwang Soo vs Dong Hyun.]

1103
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,530
Can we get a time out?

1104
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,350
- There are no time outs.
- No time outs?

1105
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,260
There are no time outs?

1106
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,950
[Attack all the lower pressure points.]

1107
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,550
[Betrayed Ha Ha's soccer kicks of rage.]

1108
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,730
- Were you on my side?
- Yes, I was on your side!

1109
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,830
Jae Suk, please!
You guys have to listen to me!

1110
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,730
Please!
Please hear me out!

1111
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:18,380
- Dong Hyun, please hear me out.
- You're a rotten jerk!

1112
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,550
I was going to get Jae Suk for you!

1113
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,950
[What a sad, and pathetic sight to behold.]

1114
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,080
Please just hear me out.

1115
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,910
- I will see you in jail.
- You just wait and see.

1116
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:36,220
- Please hear me out.
- We're going to get our revenge.

1117
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,250
You're responsible for this happening to me.
Everyone will be after you.

1118
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:44,110
Jong Kook... he's going to come after you.
Jong Kook will be after you!

1119
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,430
I'm sorry!

1120
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,860
- I've never seen anything like that!
- What have you ripped off?

1121
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,920
[The fighter's monstrous strength rips up
the strong fabric into shreds.]

1122
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,550
[Raggedy as his jacket has become,
Kwang Soo is out!]

1123
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,710
- I've even ripped up your jacket.
- Follow me!

1124
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,100
No, you two can come with me.

1125
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,270
- Gary, out.
- Is that Dong Hyun's doing?

1126
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,840
[Maybe it's time for me to
start loosening up my muscles.]

1127
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,470
The time has finally come.
It's time for me to get ready.

1128
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,300
I bet getting ousted must be very upsetting.
What are the eliminated members doing?

1129
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:39,130
- They're in jail.
- SBS has a jail cell?

1130
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,010
It's our own makeshift jail cell.

1131
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:47,880
- What is it?
- Are you ousted? Why did you get ousted?

1132
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,660
- Who did you get eliminated by?
- I just came by to see how you're doing.

1133
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,660
[Just came by to take a tour
of the SBS jail cell.]

1134
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,250
- Just eliminate them all.
- When I think about Jong Kook...

1135
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,420
then I'm reminded of Dong Hyun.

1136
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,700
But when I think about Dong Hyun,
then I'm reminded of Jong Kook.

1137
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:06,850
- Give me some helpful tips.
- You have to join forces.

1138
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,100
You have to join forces with
Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo.

1139
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,770
Join forces with Suk Jin, and Ji Hyo,
then eliminate them both after that.

1140
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,530
No, you can't do that.
Here she comes right now.

1141
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,340
[Just then, Ji Hyo walks into the jail cell.]
- Ji Hyo, have you been eliminated?

1142
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
- She's just here to look around.
- Ji Hyo, are you ousted?

1143
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,000
- No, I'm not ousted.
- Then help Shi Kyung eliminate others.

1144
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,550
[Then what is she doing in jail?]

1145
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,490
- I want to open one more locker.
- Do you remember our agreement?

1146
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,520
We seriously have to try to open
the locker on the third floor.

1147
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,850
We seriously have to open the locker
up on the third floor!

1148
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:43,860
- Kiss her! Kiss her!
- Deep.

1149
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,500
- But...
- You two need to join forces.

1150
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,860
- We need to open the locker.
- Join forces, and eliminate the other two.

1151
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:54,590
I'm too scared of those two right now.

1152
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:55,650
[Will they be able to stop the beasts?]

1153
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,910
He's coming!
He's headed this way!

1154
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,960
[Where could Suk Jin be hiding?]

1155
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,000
There he is.
I think I need to eliminate him.

1156
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,690
[Big-nose is captured
by the fighter's radar.]

1157
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,720
This won't do.

1158
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,510
[I'm going to get caught if
I don't do something.]

1159
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:27,350
[I'm pretty sure that
he's around here somewhere...]

1160
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,150
[So that's where you've been hiding?]

1161
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:45,890
[But I can still see you very clearly.]

1162
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,650
We still have Jong Kook to deal with.

1163
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:53,560
Aren't you going to fight Jong Kook?
Just pretend that I don't even exist.

1164
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,140
[This can wait until everyone else
has already been eliminated.]

1165
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,890
I'm telling you that Jong Kook is
over there, and he's headed this way.

1166
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,340
- I didn't know that you were here.
- Jong Kook.

1167
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:08,460
- Just head back downstairs.
- Okay, Dong Hyun.

1168
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,580
[You can't steal my prey
away from me!]

1169
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,450
Have a good time!

1170
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:16,630
[Just then! Big-nose
launches an ambush attack!]

1171
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,300
[He almost has him!]

1172
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,240
[Fighter's animalistic instinct kicks in!]

1173
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,010
[Big-nose is attacked as soon as
his ambush attack fails.]

1174
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,190
Who fell?

1175
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,890
Suk Jin, I'm so sorry.

1176
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,270
It's okay, I just won't
watch your fights anymore.

1177
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:45,170
[The fighter is reduced down to begging
from the unexpected grudge from Big-nose.]

1178
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,630
[Big-nose's 18 coins
are handed over to Dong Hyun.]

1179
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:52,530
You only gave me 17.

1180
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:55,070
Can't I just keep one as a keepsake?

1181
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,840
[Big-nose is eliminated with laughter.]

1182
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:09,780
[Shi Kyung, and Blank Ji head down
to the locker that she saw earlier.]

1183
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,460
[After the hint that she saw, she's
convinced Shi Kyung's eight is needed.]

1184
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,990
[This could be the final locker
that they need.]

1185
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,800
Mine is a dud.

1186
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,060
[What's this?]

1187
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,980
Where did everyone go?

1188
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,200
I bet they're either on the 15th floor,
or on the main floor.

1189
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,580
Tenth floor.

1190
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,840
[The elevator is headed up
from the tenth floor?]

1191
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,720
11... 12... I think it's still coming.
13...

1192
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:52,650
[Verifies that the elevator stopped on 13,
and Kkuk heads down to the 13th floor.]

1193
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,660
I'll head out first.

1194
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,970
[Kkuk's guess is right on the mark!]

1195
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,840
[These two remain clueless
of their imminent danger.]

1196
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,400
- Let's get started.
- There's Jong Kook.

1197
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,480
[I've got you now!]

1198
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,400
What are you guys doing?

1199
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,110
We have to get away from him.

1200
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,550
Why are you guys running away
from me? Hey, let's talk.

1201
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,000
[What do we do?]

1202
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,200
Come on, let's talk. Why are you
guys sticking together like that?

1203
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,080
Why are you guys together like that?
There's no need for that, is there?

1204
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,390
I told him that I'd protect him.

1205
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,410
You're going to protect him?

1206
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,300
Shi Kyung, don't you want to
rip off her name tag?

1207
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,830
- My fingers are itching for it right now.
- But we're going to come after you first.

1208
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,390
Jong Kook, you can come after me,
or Dong Hyun.

1209
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,880
[Let's just get out of here for now.]

1210
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,510
I wonder if Dong Hyun's upstairs.

1211
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:04,090
[The two run away with their hands
tightly clasped together.]

1212
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,850
[Just then, Dong Hyun comes
onto the scene!]

1213
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:11,390
I'll flush them out towards you.

1214
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:16,080
[The two beasts team up together
to hunt down the remaining two.]

1215
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,460
He's coming!

1216
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,100
[Kkuk's net is starting to close in.]

1217
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,600
[And the direction
they're headed towards is...]

1218
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:34,440
[Peek-a-boo!]

1219
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,270
What is this!

1220
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,590
Fancy running into you here.

1221
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,820
[Surrounded on all sides.]

1222
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,050
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Let's separate these two.

1223
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,040
[What's even more terrifying are
their cheery, and smiley faces.]

1224
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,310
- You're seriously going to regret this.
- You think we're going to regret it?

1225
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,080
Why?

1226
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,900
I feel like I'm going to die just from
the sheer intimidation from these two.

1227
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,830
You're aware that a lion doesn't let go
of anything once it sinks its teeth into it?

1228
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:08,130
Have you forgotten that
you're a human being?

1229
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,650
- Oops, I guess you're right.
- It's okay to forget once in a while.

1230
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,120
[All joking aside,
they start to attack for real.]

1231
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,090
[Successfully separates the two prey.]

1232
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:23,710
[An extremely disadvantageous battle
for Blank Ji, and Shi Kyung.]

1233
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,460
[Blank Ji is out! It's now down
to two hunters, and one prey.]

1234
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,770
You're so stupid!
Don't you remember what I told you?

1235
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,730
What!

1236
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,290
You're so stupid!
Don't you remember what I told you?

1237
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:48,570
- What! What is this!
- What happened?

1238
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,560
[Reflect]

1239
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,180
[Elimination reflection-
The eliminator is the one to get ousted.]

1240
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,460
[That's why I told you
that you're going to regret it...]

1241
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:05,150
[The final locker that Shi Kyung,
and Blank Ji had opened...]

1242
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:09,420
[Shi Kyung earns himself a 'Reflect' sign
from the locker.]

1243
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,750
So I'll just have to pretend
like I'm doing my best?

1244
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:21,840
[So thanks to Shi Kyung's acting skills,
Kkuk fell for it completely.]

1245
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:27,150
What!
What the heck is this!

1246
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:33,210
[Even Blank Ji was unaware
of this truth?]

1247
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:38,680
- Why is there an elimination reflection?
- Jong Kook!

1248
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,510
I really wanted a big match with you.
I even had a plan for it.

1249
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:47,750
I even had a whole plan for it.
Next time... I'll see you in the ring.

1250
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,680
- I'll see you in the cage.
- Call me, and I'll meet you in the cage!

1251
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,100
- I'll see you in there for sure!
- Okay, you got it.

1252
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,430
[Unfortunately, the showdown between
the two hunters will be delayed.]

1253
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,730
Good luck.

1254
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:01,350
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1255
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:07,370
[At last... the currency exchange is open!]

1256
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:13,420
[Dong Hyun is in the current lead
with a total of 80 coins.]

1257
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,280
[Instead of exchanging his currency,
he sits, and waits for Shi Kyung to arrive.]

1258
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:20,550
[And watching this whole scene
in secret is...]

1259
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,270
[Shi Kyung, with his 50 coins.]

1260
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,740
[It's time to face the battle!]

1261
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,320
[Ambush attack!]

1262
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:33,200
[Fighter, Kim Dong Hyun vs
Brain, Sung Shi Kyung.]

1263
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,600
[What will be the result of this battle?]

1264
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,390
We will first reveal who the
final winner is.

1265
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:43,280
Please lift up the money bag
on the count of three.

1266
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,160
[The race of the golden key-
Time to reveal the winner.]

1267
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,330
- Who's the winner?
- Three!

1268
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,060
[Dong Hyun vs Shi Kyung.
Who's the final winner?]

1269
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:57,440
[The Stun gun, Kim Dong Hyun, wins!]

1270
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,640
[Shi Kyung's ambush attempt
is easily thwarted.]

1271
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,310
[And is twisted into a compromising
position in an alarming speed.]

1272
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,780
- No, this is so unfair!
- The world is an unfair place.

1273
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,950
I can't carry a tune myself.

1274
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:16,220
- Why do I...
- What did I tell you about the lions?

1275
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,890
[A lion never lets go of its prey.]

1276
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,400
[Sung Shi Kyung, out!]

1277
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:29,510
[Complete humiliation]

1278
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,680
[Winner, Kim Dong Hyun,
wins a total of 130 coins.]

1279
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,670
[Wins a prize of 1.3 million Won.]

1280
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,580
- This is awesome.
- I had so much fun.

1281
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,890
The writers did such a great job
of setting up all the games, and scenes.

1282
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:50,090
It really helps to put you in the mood,
and you really get into it.

1283
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:54,910
- I'm bummed I didn't get to fight Jong Kook.
- You'll just have to come back then.

1284
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,650
I'll see you in the cage.

1285
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,810
[We'll wait to see your battle
inside the cage.]

1286
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:03,160
Let's give our winner, Kim Dong Hyun,
a huge round of applause!

1287
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,790
[We wish you all the luck
in the fighting cage!]
