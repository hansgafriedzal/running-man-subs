- I like the music.
- It's exciting!

[Come dressed in what you
wore when you were 20.]

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,640

[Gary is wearing a dreadlock wig.]

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,780
- Gary actually looked like that.
- Yes, I looked like this.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,390
When I was a VJ, I wore this
and stayed in the back.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,540
- I used to wear these earrings.
- Those huge earrings!

- I copied Chow Yun Fat's style.
- With a muffler?

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,880
People used to chew on a match, too.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,860
This style is my generation.
He's supposed to wear bell bottoms.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,990
It was straight cut!
What bell bottoms?

- That shouldn't be his fashion!
- How old are you?

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,540
I used to wear clothes like this
when I was 20.

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,620
The denim fashion made
a comeback many times.

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,960
- Did he fake his age?
- What are you talking about?

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,590
- Were you overseas?
- Where in the world was it?

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,360
Actually, it wasn't that different
from what people wear now.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,020
Ah, I see.

52
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,590
- Did you play with this?
- Of course, we always played it.

53

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,580

- Woo Bin!
[Show us, Woo Bin!]

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,140
I think he's a good fighter.
I saw him in 'Friends 2.'

57
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
I think he'll hit 1,000.

58
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,760
Tall guys are usually strong.

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
[Powerful punch]
- That's right! The sound tells it all.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,190
I think he scored pretty high.

61

- Do it, Jong Kook!
- Mr. Capable is pressured.

65
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,790
He should score 500 at least.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
He looks like a gangster from LA.

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,700

- It's like a fighting game in real life.

- It sounded different.
- It bounced back.

71

- It made me jump!

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,990
[Winner! Big-nose scored 100!]

- Thank you.
[An announcement of the winner?]

I think you're the leading
character today.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,860
Big-nose scored 100.

83
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,780
<i>Big-nose, please take the winning prize.</i>

84
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,720
- Me?
- Winning prize, now?

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,900
[There are ten gold bars
that are 3.75 grams each.]

86
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,100
Is today Suk Jin's last day
on Running Man?

87
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,440
No, I think this is the future and
we have to let it happen or something?

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,100
Maybe the future came first.

89
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,440
<i>Today, the winner had been
nominated and that's Ji Suk Jin.</i>

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,860
<i>If Suk Jin scores 100 and
becomes the winner</i>

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,600
<i>all of you will win, too.</i>

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,460
We have to help him, then.

93
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,900
<i>Nine members will need to have a
strategy to help Suk Jin win the race.</i>

94
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,100
- You should do worse than me.
- What?

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,980
- It's not an easy task.
- It's too difficult!

96
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,740
<i>Ji Suk Jin has to have 100 points at
the end and that's how you can win.</i>

97
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,940
<i>Please help Ji Suk Jin today.</i>

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
We might get competitive
and win over him.

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,760
- We can do it.
- Let's do it!

100
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll do worse if you make me feel bad.
Then I'll have to return the gold.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,660
You should check carefully,
they might be switched to fake gold.

102
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,540
[Will they be able to make Big-nose win?]

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,320

[For Big-nose's win, let's go!]

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,660
- Do we all go together?
- In one car?

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,160
[They need to go to
their first mission site.]

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,190
- Oh, I forgot to bring it.
- What?

110
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,410
- Do you mean, the gold?
- I'll bring it.

111
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,840
You can't forget what we play for.

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,500
[Big-nose lost the gold.]

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,600
- Huh? I'm in trouble.
[Not in the waiting room.]

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,120
- How can you lose that?
- He looks embarrassed.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,780
You kept it?

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,820
I thought I lost it.
Okay.

117
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,790
Ten of them!

118
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,820
He's here.
Five, four, three, two, one!

119
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
[Move!]

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,560
[Where are you going?]
- Hey!

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,380
[Big-nosed brother, wake up!]

122
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,440
We need to give Suk Jin some tension.

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,090
Hey!

124
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,220
Hey!

125
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
[You can't make
these kind of mistakes!]

126
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,300
He needs some training.
Do it one more time.

127
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,120
[Don't go!]

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,960
[Site of big-nose's training.]

129
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,220
He doesn't exercise at all.

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,220
[They care about their eldest brother.]

131
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,490
Run faster!

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,810
- Do some exercise.
- We trained you.

133
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,940
You'll only be able to take this
when I win, you know?

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
- I want to talk to Woo Bin.
- Me?

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,840
- It's been a year already.
- Right.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,500
- What is?
- Since we went to Australia with Woo Bin.

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,990
- It was that long ago?
- We didn't let Woo Bin sleep.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,500
- The ocean was so beautiful.
- The coastline, too!

139
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,630
I still remember the sight.

140
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,290
- By the way, Suk Jin has to...
- I have to win but...

141
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,930
what games will they be?

142
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,660
It's not just about winning
because they mentioned '100 points'.

143
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,740
We have to get that score.

144
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,420
Work harder, Suk Jin.

145
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,240
It'll be more difficult
than just winning.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,710
[What awaits them...]

147
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,600
<i>It's a pool.</i>

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,460
- There are towels.
- What is that? It's a team game.

149
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,520
It's for two teams?

150
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,920
<i>It's the first round of
'Make Big-nose the winner.'</i>

151
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,280
It's not easy.
Everyone says it's too difficult.

152
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,450
This is the most difficult game
in RM history.

153
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,620
Everybody said it's too hard.

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,790
<i>The first game will be
'Oh, shiny 20's quiz.'</i>

155
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,790
- What's that?
- A quiz game?

156
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,840
<i>You'll be in two teams.
One with Ji Suk Jin, and one without.</i>

157
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,940
You'll see why it matters in the game.

158
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Which is better...

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh, we can decide the
team members?

160
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,620
People who are good
with quizzes should come here.

161
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,690
You should come to my team, Jae Suk.

162
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,640
Why did you move, Woo Bin?

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,540
- It's okay, Woo Bin.
[He volunteers to go.]

164
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,690
Wow, Woo Bin just volunteered to go.

165
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,490
- This is perfect.
- I'll do my best.

166
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,480
Some of my team members are...

167
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,620
Junho wears the mask of 2PM but...

168
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,090
You're kind of risky.

169
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,200
I think Junho missed the timing.

170
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
[Accidentally, he became a member
who's good at quizzes.]

171
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,460
While I wasn't paying attention,
everyone already moved.

172
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Did you decide the teams?

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,940
Don't forget. I have to win,
so you can win.

174
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,780
You know we're actually
the same team.

175
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,620
We'll say the correct answer,
if you bother us.

176
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,980
I lose my temper sometimes.

177
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,790
Don't offend them.

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,020
- We could clear this round!
- Should we clear it?

179
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,090
- Good job.
- Just remember.

180
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,600
We have to make you win.
You're not going to win.

181
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,090
- I should do well, too.
[Their teamwork doesn't seem so strong.]

182
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,440
[Ten water bombs are installed in the pool.]

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,390
- Look at the water.
- This is going to be hard.

184
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,140
Won't they guess right
just to avoid getting wet?

185
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,490
<i>I'll tell you the rules now.</i>

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,400
- Each member will solve a quiz.
- And?

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,990
<i>If all the team members get it right,
each member will score 30 points.</i>

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,990
<i>'Team Ji Suk Jin' will solve
short-answer questions.</i>

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,860
<i>- And 'Team Not Suk Jin' will solve...
- Multiple choice questions?</i>

190
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,540
<i>Dichotomous questions.</i>

191
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,760
<i>Dichotomous questions,
choose between the two.</i>

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,780
<i>When the answer is wrong,
the whole team will be water bombed.</i>

193
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,890
I told you one smart person
should be there.

194
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,400
- They need smart people.
- Why is that?

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,280
They might ask difficult questions.
You actually need to know to be wrong.

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,290
That's why I came to this team.

197
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,620
[Trust me, I'm the brain.]

198
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,090
You're the black hole!

199
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,700
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Why?

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,180
Some of you have glassy looks.

201
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,980
Before tests, people do.

202
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,160
- Not all, but some of them...
- Don't make them mad!

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
- They have glassy looks!
- I'll guess the right answer, then!

204
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
It's better if we go first.

205
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,260
They can see our score
and control their score.

206
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,690
We're in the same team!

207
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,420
- Don't forget we're one.
- Remember and work hard!

208
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,400
- Let's do our best.
- Guessing them correct isn't that easy.

209
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,000
- Pocket your pride.
- I see, I see!

210
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,490
<i>First question is
for Kang Ha Neul.</i>

211
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,290
- It's important to have good roots.
- He looks smart.

212
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:51,000
- He's been acting as smart characters.
- He's always acted as an elite man.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,700
- Like a prosecutor.
- That's just the role!

214
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's see.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,220
- I'll count on you.
- Let's check.

216
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,890
- Mother!
- Yes.

217
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,790
- Hope you all get a jackpot!
[His mom's doppelganger.]

218
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,560
- He looks exactly like his mom.
- I know that.

219
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,400
You look like her, especially today.

220
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,720
His hair is long now,
so he's more like his mom now.

221
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,140
- Especially when he smiles.
- He does.

222
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,090
<i>I'll give Ha Neul the first question.</i>

223
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,490
<i>Male hormones are called androgens</i>

224
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,990
<i>and they are a factor into
causing 'this'.</i>

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,760
<i>'This' is also called a symbol of youth.</i>

226
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,100
You know it, right?

227
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,510
<i>What is 'this'?</i>

228
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,670
You don't know?

229
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,190
- You should have asked my team.
- You know it, right?

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,760
I'll repeat the question.

231
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,390
<i>Male hormones are called androgens, and
are a factor in causing a symbol of youth.</i>

232
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,000
A symbol of youth?

233
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,660
- Say it confidently.
- Just say it!

234
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,190
Wait!

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,890
It's a pimple!

236
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,990
He's right.

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,590
- Yeah!
[Correct.]

238
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,570
[He must have been under
a lot of pressure going first.]

239
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,360
Kwang Soo said, 'it's a hair.'

240
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,500
[A symbol of youth, a hair?]
- He's so weird!

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,840
<i>Only four members are left.</i>

242
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,980
Fighting!

243
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,690
<i>The second question.</i>

244
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,990
<i>This is what you ate when
you were 20.</i>

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,190
<i>You can see this in snack bars.</i>

246
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,890
<i>It is named after its chewy texture.</i>

247
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,290
<i>What is it?</i>

248
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,570
- What's that?
- It's too easy.

249
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,290
- Are you ignoring us?
- Snack bars!

250
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,080
- It represents snack food.
- I liked it a lot.

251
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,120
Girls like it.

252
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,360
- The answer is jjolmyun
(Spicy cold chewy noodle)!

253
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,550
- Right answer.
[Correct answer]

254

[He continues their sweeping upturn.]

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,260
- I don't like jjolmyun.
- I thought it was spicy fried ramen.

256
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,190
- Why is he so happy at getting jjolmyun?
- I was confused with spicy fried ramen.

257
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,990
- Don't forget. I have to win!
- We're doing okay so far.

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,690
<i>It's for you, Jong Kook.</i>

<i>never eats 'it' thinking they might
'Nakje (fail)' because of its name.</i>

262

Because of the name?

263
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,090
What is this?

264
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,890
- Not the texture but the name.
- The name?

265
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,890
Name?
What name?

266
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,290
This one is difficult.

267
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,590
- 'Nakji (small octopus)'.
- The name makes you fail!

268
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,000
- Wow, you're amazing!
- That's the answer?

I'll win today!

276
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,060
- I thought it was seaweed.
- No, that one is for the texture.

277
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,550
<i>This question is for Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

- Isn't this too hard all of a sudden?

283

I have one word on my mind.

Hey, take your time.

- Think about it.

- I can't think of anything else!
- He didn't say, 'It is'.

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,290
He said 'what brought me up.'

294
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,190
<i>It's a two letter word.</i>

- The water is so cold!
- That was too difficult!

'Ba-ram (wind).'

- The wind brought me up?
- That's too difficult.

301
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,890
We're going to choose between two.

302
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,730
We just need to be wrong.

303
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,490
But we should know what's wrong.

304
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,990
Please be wrong.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,390
Let our team win, okay?

306
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,180
Since it's the first question,
I'll answer it correctly.

307
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,320
No, we never know.
Just be wrong.

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,660

- We should know what's wrong.

They have to be wrong.

I don't know.
I have to make a guess.

321

I've heard of narcissism before.

- It's not Narsha!
- It is number 2, Adonis complex.

- That's the right answer.
- What if it's right?

[Correct answer]
- Am I right?

- I said that's the right answer.
- That was the right answer!

326
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,120
- I was right?
- Narcissism means excessive self-love.

327
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,040
- It's not easy to be wrong.
- Narcissism means self-love.

328
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,000
He couldn't be wrong
even if he wanted to.

329

- The questions are hard.
- We're in trouble.

330
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,320
Dichotomous questions are harder!

331
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,640

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,990
<i>Many young people get 'Byun-bi
(constipation)' from dieting too severely.</i>

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,290
<i>In the word 'Byun-bi (constipation)'</i>

336
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,990
<i>what does 'bi' mean?</i>

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,290
'Bi' from 'Byun-bi'.

338
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,090
<i>'Bi' from 'Byun-bi'.</i>

339
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,020
<i>What's the meaning of the 'bi'?</i>

340
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,290
<i>Number one, to hide.</i>

341
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,390
<i>Number two, to be blocked.</i>

342
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,890
- What was number one?
- Secret, bi.

343
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,750
Constipation...
means it's blocked, right?

344
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,390
What if it means to hide?

345
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,890
<i>Please, answer it now.
To hide or to be blocked.</i>

346
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,800
- Just solve it.
- Follow your feeling.

347
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,020
- Won't he look dumb if he's wrong?
- It's to hide!

348
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,620
That's right.
You picked the wrong answer.

349
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,640
You know, constipation
means it's blocked...

350
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,090
- What?
- Really?

351
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,540
[A bolt out of the blue!]

352
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,190
- What? It's not to be blocked?
- Is that a trick?

353
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,890
- That's a trick question!
- You should think it over.

354
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,220
Why would you hide it?

355
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,360
You might end up getting
them all!

356
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,860
This is a battle between
us and the producers.

357
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,360
It's really hard.

358
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,540
<i>Next question.</i>

359
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,800
<i>The year 1985 was when
Ji Suk Jin was 20 years old.</i>

360
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,780
- It's when we were born.
- I wasn't even born yet.

361
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,940
Didn't you go to night clubs
at the time?

362
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,920
<i>What happened in 1985?</i>

363
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>Number one,
'Back to the Future 1' was released.</i>

364
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,100
I can't believe it!

365
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,620
<i>Number two,
'Terminator 1' was released.</i>

366
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,020
- I don't know.
- Terminator in 1985?

367
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,980
I think I remember watching it.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,900
You were born in 1985.

369
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,590
Wasn't 'Back to the Future'
released before?

370
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,160
No, the correct answer
is 'Back to the Future.'

371
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,540
- So, he has to choose 'Terminator.'
- I'm confused, too.

372
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,600
Choosing Terminator
will be good for us.

373
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,290
- Woo Bin!
- Yes.

374
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,520
- You should pick the wrong answer.
- Answer it wrong!

375
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,490
<i>I can't give you more time.
You have five more seconds.</i>

376
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,820
It's number two, Terminator one.

377
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,090
- He's right.
- If it's wrong, then...

378
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,430
We needs to be wrong, right?

379
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,090
[When they're wrong
they'll be water bombed.]

380
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,120
[Wrong answer!]

381
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,780
[Team Not Suk Jin fails.]

382
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,720
[It's Team Ji Suk Jin's turn.]

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,400
[Thanks to Woo Bin,
Big-nose revived.]

384
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,990
Let's just get the right answers!

385
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,690
- It's so cold!
- It's cold!

386
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,590
They will increase the amount of water.

387
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,760
There's more water now.

388
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,990
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,590
<i>Start from Kang Ha Neul.</i>

390
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,260
<i>Young men like you play
billiards, right?</i>

391
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,800
Yes, we do.

392
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,790
<i>Billiard balls used to be made
out of 'this'.</i>

393
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,680
<i>We also call universities as 'this' tower.</i>

394
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
<i>What is this?</i>

395
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,500
You know it, Ha Neul.

396
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,220
Did you just say universities?

397
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,690
<i>Billiard balls were made out of 'this'.</i>

398
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,390
<i>We also refer to universities as
'this' tower.</i>

399
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
<i>What is this?</i>

400
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,660
- Isn't it ivory?
- Ivory, yes.

401
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,180
[Even Kwang Soo seems like he knows.]

402
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,090
- You know that.
- You must know.

403
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,890
Is that it?

404
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,490
- Is that it? What if it's not?
- Ha Neul, you're right.

405
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,280
The answer is plaster!

406
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,780
[Plaster?]

407
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,880
[Are you kidding?]

408
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,070
The ivory tower!

409
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,790
That's right!
The ivory tower!

410
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,290
[Answer: ivory]

411
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,390
- Are universities plaster towers?
- I'm sorry!

412
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,660
I was confused!

413
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,880
What is a plaster tower?

414
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,790
I kept showing you with my mouth.

415
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,460
- You should come over here.
- You should switch your team.

416
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,390
Can I swap members?

417
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,340
The plaster tower,
it was very funny though.

418
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,860
No, I actually know the word.

419
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:52,060
'The plaster tower' will be next
to your name in search engines.

420
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,690
- People will remember the plaster tower.
- I really know it.

421
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,940
It will accompany your name forever.
It's too late.

422
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,840
[I said, I play intelligent characters.]

423
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,290
They tricked us.

424
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,790
They are playing with us!

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,490
Kwang Soo, try guessing it right.

426
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,990
Should I do that?

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,020
Don't try to be wrong.

428
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,800
<i>Here's the question.</i>

429
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,740
<i>Not only young men but everyone
loves beef.</i>

430
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,240
<i>Especially this part...</i>

431
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,640
Number one!

432
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,660
[Correct answer.]

433
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,940
[He's got it right.]

434
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,520
[He guessed it right without
listening to the question.]

435
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,520
- I didn't think I would get it.
- You should listen!

436
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,000
- I thought I wouldn't know.
- What are you doing?

437
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,490
<i>The part is along the inside ribs
and it looks like a thin cylinder.</i>

438
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,820
<i>One cow has very small amount of this.
1. Neck chain. 2. blade steak</i>

439
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,980
<i>Number one is the correct answer.</i>

440
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
I don't know anyway.

441
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,680
- You shouldn't give the right answer!
- You'll win at this rate.

442
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,790
- We won't be able to get any gold.
- Be careful!

443
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,880
Woo Bin, please!

444
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,580
Woo Bin has to stop this.
The next person is Gary.

445
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,890
<i>A very popular dish
for a young couple's date is</i>

446
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,190
<i>spaghetti carbonara.
In italian, 'carbonara' means</i>

447
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,490
<i>'this' maker. What is this?</i>

448
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,280
<i>Number one, firewood.
Number two, charcoal.</i>

449
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,840
- This is too much!
- Number one!

450
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,390
Number two!

451
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,360
- Wait!
- I think it's firewood.

452
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,700
That's why I picked number one.

453
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,940
We're supposed to be wrong.

454
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,690
[Wrong answer.]

455
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,960
[Team Not Suk Jin fails
at the second try.]

456
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,390
What a relief!

457
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,990
Woo Bin saved us again.

458
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,300
They would have won,
if it wasn't for Woo Bin.

459
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,190
I knew the answer,
so I picked the wrong answer.

460
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,590
- Let's switch seats.
- I hate being the first to go.

461
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,790
Switch with me Ha Neul.

462
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,200
This is a good chance, Ha Neul.

463
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
Why are you always giving me
the burden?

464
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
In my opinion...

465
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,900
it's all up to... Ha Neul.

466
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,090
I knew the word, the ivory tower.

467
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,090
<i>I'll give you the question, Suk Jin.</i>

468
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,090
<i>Age of 40 is
called 'Bulhok', and 50 is?</i>

469
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,790
I'm not sure.

470
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,890
<i>It's 'Jichunmyung.'</i>

471
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,520
<i>Then what's the name for
the age of 20?</i>

472
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,990
- It's too easy.
- Do you know it?

473
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,190
I know! I know it!

474
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,590
- He just said it's an 'adult.'
- We celebrate the coming of age day!

475
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,390
- An adult?
- Why? That's not it?

476
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,190
I hope I'm right.

477
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,890
Is that, right?

478
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,490
The sounds same
as 'provision' in a contract.

479
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,890
My answer for the 20 year old is

480
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,490
- 'Yakkwan!'
- That's right.

481
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,990
- Did you know that, Ha Neul?
- I know it.

482
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,390
<i>The next question is for Junho.</i>

483
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,090
<i>This is a word to call a hideout</i>

484
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,690
<i>and we use the word
for a gathering place.</i>

485
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,490
<i>Don't you have a place, too?</i>

486
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,390
<i>- We do have it.
- What is it?</i>

487
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,140
I think that's right, Junho.

488
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,690
Okay, the correct answer is...

489
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,360
- Agit (from agitating point)!
- That's right.

490
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
[Correct answer.]

491
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,780
[Two correct answers in a row!]

492
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,790
- If we can continue until Ha Neul!
- It's a good change!

493
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,900
It's easy word but I was
confused with 'base.'

494
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,180
<i>Kim Jong Kook, Korea has 'hanbok'
(Korean traditional dress).</i>

495
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,220
China has 'Qipao'

496
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:20,190
<i>Then, what is the name of the
Vietnamese traditional dress?</i>

497
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,990
- That's hard.
- It's confusing.

498
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,890
- We wore it when we were in Vietnam.
- Ao!

499
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,000
[They wore them when
they were shooting in Vietnam.]

500
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,020
<i>- Do I look okay in this dress?
[It's 'Ao Dai.']</i>

501
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,590
<i>You wore them when you

Even in old age,
a full of young spirit...

- I think there's something else.
- That's a given.

The fact you have to score 100...

610
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,490
is a bit suspicious.

By the way,
Ha Neul sings really well.

612
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,290

It's depressing.

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,990
It's different from when
Ha Neul sings it, right?

629
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,690

<i>If the number is less than
600, it's invalid.</i>

650
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,090
Then Suk Jin should start.

651
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,240
Around 610 is a good number, then.

652
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,100

00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,360
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
scored 89.]

672
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,760
[The score isn't bad.]

673
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,920
<i>Give me your pace counter.</i>

674
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,260
Why are we nervous?

675
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,100
<i>You can go back.</i>

676
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,780
Don't use your energy at once.

677
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,690
- I think I saw 25.
- No way, it must be 250.

678
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,890
<i>You scored 89.
Ji Suk Jin's number is...</i>

679
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,240
<i>256!</i>

680
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,700
[89+256=345]

681
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,840
<i>Song Ji Hyo's number is...</i>

682
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,620
- 260.
- Yes, 260 is good.

683
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,060
<i>Song Ji Hyo's number is 341!</i>

684
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,830
Thank you, Ji Hyo.

685
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,090
We have to score higher than that.

686
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,440
[They have to score more than
Suk Jin's team to let him win.]

687
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,480
- It has to be more than 600.
- But it's too much more!

688
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,540
<i>Ji Suk Jin and Song Ji Hyo
scored 686.</i>

689
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,610
Why is it so high?

690
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,780
<i>That's right.
You have to score more than that.</i>

691
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,140
What are we going to do?
This song has a long intro.

692
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,260
Kwang Soo can do it.

693
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,300
Sing a 2PM song!

694
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,300
- Again and again.
- 10 out of 10!

695
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,980
- How can we do it on bended knees?
- Let's do this.

696
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,500
[The sound of a heartbeat...
is that the song?]

697
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,220
[The song with the most
powerful dance?]

698
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,740
Kwang Soo is weird.

699
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,240
<i>[2PM - Heartbeat]
This is not my part.</i>

700
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,060
[He gathers all the strength...]

701
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,220
[His pace counter might break.]

702
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,400
[Very appealing.]

703
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,040
[It won't be easy scoring
more than 686.]

704
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,600
[It's the climax!]

705
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,140
[Their heartbeat is pumping.]

706
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,220
[Was this song this long?]

707
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,060
- Jump!
- Jump!

708
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,380
Still not enough!

709
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,100
Get up!

710
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,660
[Good night!]

711
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,020
[They give CPR with their cheers.]

712
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,440
You can do it!

713
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,140
You should hold it out!

714
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,800
[The song is over.]
- It was pretty long.

715
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,240
[Kwang Soo and Junho scored 97.]

716
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,350
[Totally amazing!
The result of their youth and vigor.]

717
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,730
Just watching them was enough
to tire me out.

718
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,090
I bet your heart feels like it's
about to burst out of your chest.

719
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,320
- You scored a total of 97 points.
- Yes.

720
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,280
- If you guys were to sing another song...
- No.

721
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,560
- [Why would you even say such a thing?]
- [I'm sure our score was enough.]

722
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,610
- I'm sorry.
- You're not breathing like that on purpose?

723
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,190
[The rare cardio exercise that he just got
results in him making all sorts of noises.]

724
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,200
[Anyway... what did we score
on our pedometers?]

725
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,960
353.

726
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,500
[Kwang Soo of Team Kwang Soo and Junho-
97 + 353 = A total of 450 points.]

727
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,950
[In order for Team Suk Jin to win, Junho
must've scored 236 points or higher.]

728
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,420
Junho's total count is 382.

729
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,310
[Team Kwang Soo and Junho-
450 + 382 = A total of 832 points.]

730
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,800
[With the fiery strength of youth,
Team Suk Jin is allowed to maintain the lead.]

731
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,240
- We're going to sing a ballad.
- Cue the music!

732
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,670
[Huh?
What the heck is this?]

733
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,940
[Never before seen dance moves
to a soft ballad song.]

734
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,130
[It seems they may have surpassed
the 600 point mark already.]

735
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,840
- He's so scary!
- Are you a ghoul or something?

736
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:59,710
[Haven't you ever heard of the
urban legend singing style?]

737
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,930
I can't even bear to listen
to his singing.

738
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,950
[Jong Kook ends his portion of the song
with an eerie lingering note.]

739
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,510
[And this one picks up with
a reggae beat.]

740
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,490
[Gets carried away with his bounce moves.]

741
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,020
[Why did you choose a ballad
if you were going to act like this?]

742
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,100
[Is he even mixing in
some light salsa moves?]

743
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,720
I really can't even stand
looking at him!

744
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,360
[Everybody, join in!]

745
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,050
[The song is coming to an end, but the
dance party is just getting started.]

746
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,100
Wow, this is a really long song.

747
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,050
[The song is coming to an end,
and it's time to say their goodbyes.]

748
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,830
[One final shake for the road.]
- You totally passed your points.

749
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,740
[What of their singing score?]

750
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,010
[Team Jong Kook and Ha Ha
scores 84 points.]

751
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,530
Ha Ha... your pedometer scored
a total of 332 points.

752
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,300
[84 + 332 = 416 points.]

753
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,990
- Kim Jong Kook... 410 points.
- Yes?

754
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,300
[416 + 410 = 826 points.]

755
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,010
You have scored a total of 826 points.

756
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,790
Okay, we got it.

757
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,650
[Team Suk Jin and Ji Hyo still maintain
their lead with 686 points.]

758
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,210
[Team Jae Suk and Gary is eliminated
from the running with 832 points.]

759
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,850
Woo Bin, do you want to take your turn?

760
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,350
- Let's go with that song you like.
- Yeah, that's a great song.

761
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,550
[Which song will these two sing?]

762
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:58,220
[Kang Ha Neul gave a perfect portrayal
of Yoon Hyung Joo in his movie.]

763
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,650
[But how will the pedometer
affect his singing skills?]

764
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,290
We're going to sing the song,
'Expression of our love'.

765
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,960
[Slowing revving up the RMP.]

766
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,390
[Here we go!]

767
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,850
[The moves of two men who have
been holding back for too long.]

768
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,060
- Stay strong, Woo Bin!
- You can do this, Woo Bin!

769
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,360
[Ha Neul is to sing the song, and
Woo Bin is to focus on the pedometer.]

770
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,590
- Kang Ha Neul!
- Wow, he's a great singer.

771
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,430
[Their never-ending supply of energy-
We are the superstars of youth!]

772
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,520
[Ha Neul's energy keeps on going
all the way to the end.]

773
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,020
He's a really good singer.

774
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,530
[Ha Neul and Woo Bin make
a great team.]

775
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,540
[Team Woo Bin and Ha Neul's
song comes to an end.]

776
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,380
Encore!
Encore!

777
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,910
[Please don't say such harsh words...]

778
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,100
How did he sing so well
while running around like that?

779
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,360
88 points!

780
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,210
- You totally put up a good fight!
- That was great.

781
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,790
[What did this dynamic duo score
on their pedometers?]

782
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,580
- Their lung sizes are just different.
- It's 'Lung capacity'.

783
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,600
- Kim Woo Bin... 332 points.
- Yes?

784
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,980
- Okay, they're going to be fine.
[88 + 332 = 420 points.]

785
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,110
I think they're going to be fine.

786
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,240
- But Kang Ha Neul is the problem.
- Why?

787
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,740
- Why is Ha Neul the problem?
- I will reveal his results.

788
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,750
- Ha Neul did a good job.
- He jumped around a lot.

789
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,170
- What is it?
- Is it over 400?

790
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,020
- 128? Is that for real?
- 128?

791
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,030
[Just how in the world did
this happen?]

792
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:18,290
I bet we pressed down on the button.

793
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,550
I bet we accidentally did
something wrong.

794
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,810
They had a total score of 548.

795
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,880
[Rule- Less than 600 points doesn't count.
Must remake their attempt.]

796
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,500
We're going to just add in
your new singing score.

797
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,520
We won't do the pedometer portion again,
and you must score a total of 138 points.

798
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,980
- Then Team Suk Jin will maintain the lead.
- Okay.

799
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,480
[Their two combined scores must be over
138 points for Team Suk Jin to win.]

800
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,250
- What are you going to sing?
- Emerald Castle's 'Footsteps'.

801
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,300
- Kwang Soo loves that song.
- I totally love that song!

802
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,910
- That's totally Kwang Soo's style.
- That's a real man's song.

803
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,200
- What do you think you're doing?
- You'd better knock it off.

804
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,930
This song is really popular with women.

805
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,270
[The song that stirs up the emotions
in a woman's heart.]

806
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:15,840
[How will Ha Neul do with the song?]

807
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,190
[Kang Ha Neul's singing voice is like
taking a stroll in Haneul (heaven).]

808
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,890
- What is the matter with you?
- I really love this song!

809
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:03,320
[His sweet voice and the longing stare
makes for a killer combo.]

810
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,240
[Explosion of lip-synching performance.]

811
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,980
[Slowing building up to the climax.]

812
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,550
[Just get away from each other!]

813
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,220
[Our Ha Neul is awesome!]

814
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:37,910
[Too overly empathetic.]

815
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,950
[There's the angelic voice.]

816
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,360
- Kang Ha Neul is the best!
- Great job.

817
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,850
Let's see what he scored.

818
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,800
[A very high score is being
expected by everyone.]

819
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,990
[Please show us what Ha Neul scored.]

820
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,060
- Seventy...
- What!

821
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,310
- What?
- What did he score?

822
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,160
[What did he score?]

823
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,170
[No way!]

824
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,540
- Woo Bin, I think it's up to you.
- How did he only score 71 points?

825
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,150
- You should've sang some backup.
- I can't do this anymore.

826
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,490
I think I'm spent.

827
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,450
- What is their score so far?
- The current score is...

828
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:57,600
Their current total is 619 points.
At least 67 points are needed...

829
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,490
[Woo Bin needs to score at least 67 points
in order for Team Suk Jin to win.]

830
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,980
- Woo Bin holds the key to Suk Jin's fate.
- You just need to score 68 points!

831
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,560
Please take care of me, Woo Bin!
Fighting!

832
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,240
[Time to reveal Woo Bin's singing skills.]
- It's all in your hands!

833
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,000
[67 points? I will blow that
out of the water with this song.]

834
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,360
[Everyone is jumping into the spirit
to cheer Woo Bin on.]

835
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,900
[Shall we get this party started?]

836
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,120
[Keeping up the nice beat]

837
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,680
[A man who knows his beat, and a
man who knows his trot- Kim Woo Bin.]

838
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,010
[Please score at least 67 points!]

839
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:24,970
[The fate of this mission hangs
on Kim Woo Bin's mic!]

840
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,550
'Like another fool in the day...'

841
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,000
[The vigor of youth-
Locked and loaded!]

842
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,550
[Fire!]

843
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:46,760
[Woo Bin's song will decide the
fate of their mission!]

844
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,640
[Woo Bin's song comes to an end
in the midst of all the chaos.]

845
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,010
- The machine said it wasn't bad.
- That has to be at least 80 points.

846
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,720
But didn't the machine also say
that he needs to work harder?

847
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,520
- I bet it's around 80 points.
- We've got the score.

848
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,860
- What's the score?
- We've put all our heart and soul into it.

849
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,730
We really gave it our best.
We worked together as one!

850
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,640
- Please...
- That was at least 80 points.

851
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,440
Here's Kim Woo Bin's score.

852
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,630
[What did Woo Bin score?]

853
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:25,960
[Did he... surpass his goal of 67 points?]

854
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:32,950
[Woo Bin scores a total of 82 points!]

855
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:39,090
[Woo Bin's song is a huge success!]

856
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,820
Why are we going through all this
trouble just for Suk Jin?

857
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,820
It's for the sake of all our victory!

858
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,020
- My win also means your end.
- Great job!

859
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,760
[Suk Jin still continues to maintain his
lead even after this mission.]

860
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,940
Kim Woo Bin, and Kang Ha Neul are now
in second place with a total of 701 points.

861
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,790
[Woo Bin and Ha Neul each earn 40 points
for having come in at second place.]

862
00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:00,800
[Team Suk Jin and Ji Hyo- First place.
Earns 50 points each.]

863
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,180
- Then am I going to get 50 points?
- Yes, you've been given 50 points.

864
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,700
- Then I have a total of 80 points?
- Yes, that's correct.

865
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,590
You just need to earn 20 more points.

866
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,570
- Wow.
- Then he's all set.

867
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,520
[Will Woo Bin continue to lend a
helping hand even to the very end?]

868
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,860
<i>At last, it's time for the
final mission.</i>

869
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,980
<i>I will now explain to you
what your final mission is going to be.</i>

870
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,830
[A place that is filled with
impressive looking fossils.]

871
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,660
[A special setting
for today's final mission!]

872
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,650
Here's your final mission.

873
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,200
Your final mission is...
'Frightening name tag elimination.'

874
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,770
Frightening name tag elimination?

875
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,750
We will now start a name tag
elimination game.

876
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,670
Inside this museum...

877
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,740
there are a total of eight hunters
who are after your name tags.

878
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,490
Their goal will be to oust you
from the game.

879
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,300
- So we're not eliminating each other?
- I'm going to lose my mind.

880
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,430
- We're going to have to protect Suk Jin.
- You guys have to protect me.

881
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,600
- But there are five of them?
- Can we eliminate them, too?

882
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,310
You can earn a total of ten points for
each hunter's name tag that you eliminate.

883
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,450
[Hunter's name tags are worth
ten points each!]

884
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,940
- We have to help Suk Jin eliminate two.
- How are we going to do that!

885
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,570
- You guys can't leave me alone.
- What if it's that monster again?

886
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,260
What if it's the monster again?

887
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,890
[Five name tag hunters that are
far more fearsome than the monster!]

888
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,010
[Our names are...]

889
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:25,750
[Moo Sup Goon-
'Army of Fearsome'.]

890
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,250
Even the title of this mission is
'Frightening name tag elimination'.

891
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,660
I think we're really going to
spring into action today.

892
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,720
Is the mission over
once Suk Jin is eliminated?

893
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,450
- Yes, that would be the end of it.
- Then our whole race would be over.

894
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,980
My elimination would mean
the end of this race.

895
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,110
- You can't run away.
- No, I won't run away.

896
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,260
[A warning to the newbies
not to run away out of fear.]

897
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,960
If the situation becomes that dangerous,
then I'm going to run away first.

898
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,230
So you have to eliminate him
while I make my escape.

899
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,600
Then that's when you'll eliminate him.

900
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,630
You're just like how you appear
on the show!

901
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:07,500
Turn Big-nose into a winner... The name
tag elimination game will now start.

902
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,020
[Are you ready for the
frightening name tag elimination?]

903
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:15,930
Five, four, three, two, one... Start!

904
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:23,510
[Big-nose is the precious commodity that
Kkuk and Woo Bin have sworn to protect.]

905
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,920
- Don't worry, Suk Jin.
- You'll really have to help me.

906
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,480
I really haven't been very good
with the name tag elimination lately.

907
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,710
I keep grabbing the wrong thing.

908
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,540
[Ha Neul keeps following around
on Kwang Soo's tail.]

909
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,330
<i>What the heck is that!</i>

910
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,240
What is it!

911
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,480
- What is it!
- Go up the stairs!

912
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,300
[Everyone goes into a state of panic
after hearing the scream.]

913
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,560
[The person shouting out the screams is...]

914
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:15,730
What the heck is that!

915
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:23,250
[Junho's scream sends everyone
into a state of terror.]

916
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,480
[The scream sends these four members
into a cluster of terror.]

917
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,810
There was a guy who looked like
the grim reaper.

918
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:37,260
- What? He had his pants off?
- No, he had a black mask on his face.

919
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,990
[There he is!]

920
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,500
[Finally making his appearance is...]

921
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,320
[A member of the 'Army of Fearsome'.]

922
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,100
[Just then, Haroro discovers
the back of the army member.]

923
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,300
[A seven to one face-off.]

924
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,290
He's running away!

925
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:05,450
[The plan must be to eliminate
their prey one by one?]

926
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,430
Don't we need to eliminate them, too?

927
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,430
[An emergency meeting.]

928
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,220
- His build is no joke.
- Who is it?

929
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,640
- Is it a fighter?
- His build is no joke.

930
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,830
[The group continues to
quake with fear.]

931
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,170
- Let's all go as a group.
- There are seven of us right now.

932
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,060
Where did Suk Jin go? If he's
eliminated, then the race is over!

933
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,740
[Big-nose is busy practicing
his evasive moves.]

934
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:42,060
You have to do it right!
Woo Bin is doing a good job.

935
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,000
- This is how we're going to do it?
- Yes.

936
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,990
- You'll block him, and I'll evade?
- Keep your distance, to avoid being ousted.

937
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,190
We have to help Suk Jin
eliminate them, right?

938
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,610
- We have to eliminate some first.
- We have to bring down their numbers.

939
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,740
[They must eliminate at least
one member of the army first.]

940
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,710
- There!
- Where?

941
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,940
He's right over there.

942
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,320
Wow, he's really scary looking.

943
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,270
We can't run away!

944
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:19,970
[Everyone runs away at the speed of light
while shouting out that they can't run away.]

945
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,180
- We can't run away from them.
- We have to stick together.

946
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,500
- Some of us needs to attack.
- We have to stick together, and not run.

947
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,710
[Who should I eliminate first?]
- There are seven of us here.

948
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,280
- Come and get us.
- You can't take us all down.

949
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,510
[The group of seven is too much
even for the fearsome army member?]

950
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,540
[Time to retreat!]

951
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,380
[Two more army members join in!]

952
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:58,030
[An immediate U-Turn... and attacks!]

953
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,720
[Running Man members
are once again on the run.]

954
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,350
[The dead-end ends at an elevator.]

955
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,310
[There you all are.]

956
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,280
Fine, come on in.

957
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,760
Come in, if you'd like.

958
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,400
[I'll let you go this time.]

959
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,630
[What a relief!]

960
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,440
Who elbowed me while we
were running?

961
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,270
- Which one of you elbowed me?
- Maybe you were in the way.

962
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,230
[All the weaklings start the blame game.]
- We seriously have to stop running away.

963
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:41,360
- We're greater in numbers!
- I bet they'll be waiting for us.

964
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,540
[The group calms down,
and arrives back on the main floor.]

965
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,190
- Here he comes.
- Someone's behind us, too!

966
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,170
[The army members start to
make their appearance on the scene.]

967
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,010
- We have to stop being so afraid!
- Kwang Soo!

968
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,420
[Ha Neul sneaks behind the
column to hide.]

969
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:18,040
[Barely manages to escape danger
with the help of his members.]

970
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:23,280
[It's time to make our attack!]

971
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,060
[Another army member
runs over to the group!]

972
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,870
[Giraffe rushes over to block the attack.]

973
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:34,040
[While holding off
five members all on his own...]

974
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,420
[Huh?]

975
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:43,120
[Got it... no, lost it!]

976
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:50,450
[Haroro... successfully eliminates one!]

977
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,280
[One army member- Out!]

978
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,880
Here comes another one!

979
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,530
[Another army member rushes over
from the other side.]

980
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:04,290
[Gets a huge confidence boost
after ousting their first army member.]

981
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,340
[Both of his arms are pinned down
in the blink of an eye...]

982
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,900
[And Haroro attacks!]

983
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,980
Rip it off!

984
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,640
[Haroro already has the name tag in
hand, and Gary also reaches in?]

985
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:25,340
[Second army member is ousted
with Gary's assisted elimination!]

986
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,610
[What is going on here?
This isn't looking good for the army.]

987
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:33,110
[The brick house army member
launches his attack.]

988
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,360
[Faces off with all seven members!]

989
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:49,470
[It's time to put their
practice moves into action!]

990
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:57,620
[The army member is trying to
lure them into a corner.]

991
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,470
[What luck!]

992
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:11,780
[A chance for Big-nose to
score some points!]

993
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,860
That hurts!

994
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,050
Suk Jin has to rip it off!

995
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:25,390
[The army member continues to fend off
all ten members by himself!]

996
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:32,720
[Now... all they need is for Big-nose
to rip the name tag off of his back...]

997
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,030
[The name tag must be eliminated before
another army member shows up on the scene!]

998
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,940
[With every ounce of energy
he has in his body...]

999
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,170
[Big-nose successfully
eliminates the name tag!]

1000
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,500
[Big-nose, with a total of 90 points!
Only one more name tag left to go!]

1001
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:59,780
- Wow, you're unbelievably strong.
- Thank you for all your hard work.

1002
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:03,240
[Only two more army members remain!]

1003
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,480
I only need to eliminate
one more person.

1004
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,190
- Okay, let's go.
- Hold on just a little bit longer.

1005
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:14,830
- Everyone's doing a great job.
- Fighting!

1006
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,980
[Greatest outcome they could hope for-
A total of three army members ousted already!]

1007
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:20,070
[So, that's how you want to play the game?]

1008
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:25,620
- Okay, let's go.
[Then we'll have to change our strategy.]

1009
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,840
[The army members are nowhere
to be seen.]

1010
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:38,300
[The group agrees to break off
to search in smaller groups.]

1011
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,560
Should we go upstairs
to get a birds' eye view?

1012
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,500
Think about meeting that
while you're in the water.

1013
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,850
That thing is huge!

1014
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,820
[Thinking about fending off the army
keeps them busy enough...]

1015
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,500
That thing is absolutely terrifying.

1016
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,540
It's not easy finding them
since there are only two of them left.

1017
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,200
- Want to go towards the emergency exit?
- Okay, let's go.

1018
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,380
[Do they hear a noise coming
from the emergency exits?]

1019
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,480
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo are also busy
searching the emergency exit area.]

1020
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,410
[The two remaining hunters were lying
in wait to ambush their prey.]

1021
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,240
[Let's just escape for now!]

1022
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,290
[Kwang Soo and Ha Neul follow
in the hunters' trail...]

1023
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,910
[and suddenly finds themselves
in a two-on-two face-off.]

1024
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:41,260
[Their hearts are still pounding
from the unexpected ambush attack.]

1025
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,250
- No!
- No!

1026
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:56,440
[Giraffe is easily eliminated...
and turns their attack on Ha Neul.]

1027
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,250
<i>Ha Neul, run!
Ha Neul!</i>

1028
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,840
<i>Run away, Ha Neul!</i>

1029
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,760
[Everyone run towards the
sound of the Giraffe's screams...]

1030
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,040
[But Ha Neul is already on the cusp
of being brought down by the hunters.]

1031
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,630
[Lee Kwang Soo and Kang Ha Neul- Out!]

1032
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:21,120
[The terrifying hunting scene
that they've just witnessed...]

1033
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,430
[Has the other members
running away in fright.]

1034
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,860
What we have to keep in mind is that
their goal is to eliminate Suk Jin.

1035
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:35,580
- They win if they eliminate Suk Jin.
- Who just got ousted?

1036
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,420
- Ha Neul.
- Ha Neul?

1037
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:41,480
Did Kwang Soo get ousted?
I think Kwang Soo just got ousted.

1038
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:45,020
Suk Jin, make sure to keep
this in mind.

1039
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,100
It's okay if we get ousted, but if you do,
then this whole race is over.

1040
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,880
That's why I have to eliminate one more
before anything happens to me.

1041
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:55,180
[But where are the hunters hiding now?]

1042
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,360
[Tightened security around Big-nose.]

1043
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,260
So this is what it feels like to have
your own personal bodyguards.

1044
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:07,680
You guys are doing a great job,
and you will be rewarded handsomely.

1045
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,940
- Okay?
- Okay, thank you.

1046
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,760
There will be gold.

1047
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,780
Thank you.

1048
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,430
I played the role of a bodyguard once
in one of my earlier sitcoms.

1049
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,020
[What an ominous coincidence...]

1050
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,590
This is the most anxious I've ever been
in all the times I've guested on this show.

1051
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,490
[Jae Suk and Junho slip back
into their search mode.]

1052
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,380
[Huh?]

1053
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:40,000
[This is how you launch an
ambush attack.]

1054
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:45,830
[Junho is brought down in
the blink of an eye!]

1055
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,050
[We're going to get you back for
bringing down our fellow army members!]

1056
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,320
[Junho and Jae Suk- Out!]

1057
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:02,400
[What in the world is happening?]

1058
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,310
- Ha Ha, what is it?
- There are two of them.

1059
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,910
- There are two of them.
- We can't run away!

1060
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:12,630
- Ha Ha, we can't run away!
- Let's just lead them out of here.

1061
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,400
[It's imperative that the group faces the
hunters together before more are ousted!]

1062
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,550
Wow, they're really scary.

1063
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:20,520
[They must eliminate at least one hunter!]
- Since Gary's a good boxer...

1064
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,730
What do my boxing skills
have anything to do with this?

1065
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,730
You know that I'm not worth anything, right?
Can we just leave Gary here, and go?

1066
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,030
[Can we just leave Gary here, and go?]

1067
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,800
- What are you saying!
[By all means...]

1068
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,970
[Goodbye, Gary.]

1069
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,970
[Just get back to what you were doing.]
- Sorry, Gary!

1070
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:47,160
- We'll just take our leave.
- We'll just be going now.

1071
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,750
[What the...]

1072
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,360
Goodbye.
Please take care of them for me.

1073
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:04,650
[Haroro, and Blank Ji...
what will become of their fate?]

1074
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,960
I think this is the worst betrayal I've ever
experienced in all five years on the show.

1075
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,660
I seriously don't even know
what to say.

1076
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:18,540
I feel about 200 times worse than any
betrayal I've experienced from Kwang Soo.

1077
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:24,910
[And the pathetic fate
that his traitor is about to face...]

1078
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,460
[Betraying his own member for
an extra five minutes in the game.]

1079
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,400
Let's just go, Ji Hyo.
Let's just go home.

1080
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:40,080
[Haroro, and Blank Ji are thus
brought to their demise.]

1081
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,440
[The only ones left remaining in the game
are Big-nose, and his two bodyguards.]

1082
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,150
[Time to prepare for the
final showdown!]

1083
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:53,340
[Where could they be hiding?]

1084
01:09:54,740 --> 01:10:02,500
[Lie in wait in their hiding spot...
and launch an ambush attack!]

1085
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,200
[It's three against two!
Time for the real face-off!]

1086
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:13,160
[No matter what happens,
Big-nose must be protected!]

1087
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:16,080
[The only place that
they haven't checked yet...]

1088
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,210
[Huh?]

1089
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,160
They're here.

1090
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:36,160
[Before they can get into position,
the hunters' makes their approach.]

1091
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:40,910
[Kkuk and Woo Bin, face-off
with the two hunters.]

1092
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,160
[Kkuk is first to launch an attack!]

1093
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,810
[The hunters lure them into a corner
where attacking will be more difficult.]

1094
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:52,870
- Let's move back.
- Why am I even here?

1095
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:55,380
Seriously, why am I even here?

1096
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,050
I don't think this is going to work
as long as they stick together.

1097
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,560
- Should I just go in the middle?
- What are you even saying?

1098
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,470
- Why don't we do it like this?
- You can't use your moves on us like this.

1099
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:15,350
We're going to unleash our own moves
if you guys keep doing this.

1100
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:19,120
We're going to break out our own moves,
and start spitting on you.

1101
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,810
[Kkuk launches another attack!]

1102
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,570
No, get out of the way!

1103
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,320
Am I getting in your way?

1104
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,600
[Very tense atmosphere in the room.]

1105
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,900
[Here's his chance!]

1106
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,680
[The Tiger moves in!]

1107
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,940
[One tiny moment is all it takes
to turn the battle around!]

1108
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,930
[A hunter is successfully
brought down!]

1109
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,620
You're amazing.
You're seriously amazing.

1110
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,960
[Even his own teammates are amazed.]
- Good work, buddy.

1111
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,890
[Only one hunter is left remaining.]
- We're going to lay ourselves down for you.

1112
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,110
- Okay!
[The rest is up to Big-nose!]

1113
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:17,280
[Three against one!
Team RM has the advantage!]

1114
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:21,370
- No, get out of the way.
- Just tell me when.

1115
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,530
It's time!
Get in here!

1116
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:27,980
- You have to come this way.
- Move, Woo Bin.

1117
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:32,500
[Even with the odds in their favor,
it's still not an easy situation.]

1118
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,970
My fingers are pinched!

1119
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,640
[You have to get in there, Big-nose!]

1120
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,860
[The name tag is finally within his view!]

1121
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,510
Move your foot out of the way!

1122
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,010
You have to grab it!

1123
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,440
[The name tag is within his grasp!]

1124
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,710
[He did it!]

1125
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:05,250
[But it isn't over yet!
A total shocker from Ji Suk Jin!]

1126
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,210
Thank you so much for all
your efforts.

1127
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:17,160
[Big-nose successfully earns
his 100 points!]

1128
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:30,540
[With Big-nose's 100 points,
everyone celebrates their victory!]

1129
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:39,170
[Big-nose, Woo Bin, and Kkuk enter
to celebrate their victory.]

1130
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,060
They pinned him down, and I ripped it off.

1131
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,480
- But there were two of them.
- Yes, but we got them both.

1132
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,610
[A great victory with the
help of his two bodyguards.]

1133
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,980
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much!

1134
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,080
[The army of fearsome hunters
also makes their appearance.]

1135
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:01,270
[Army's martial arts athletes.]

1136
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,680
Wow, they're all so good looking.

1137
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,970
[Lee Sang Soo, Cha In Ho, Jun Young Joon,
Yang Seung Ho, and Kim Chang Hyun.]

1138
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:13,230
A big thank you to all five of you for coming
on the show, and making this so exciting.

1139
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,290
- Thank you!
- You all did such a great job.

1140
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:18,410
- Thank you!
- Today's victory...

1141
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,870
belongs to our Big-nose!

1142
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:25,080
[Big-nose wins with a perfect score!]

1143
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:29,250
- You won with the perfect score.
- Yes, that's correct.

1144
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,740
Ten pieces of gold.

1145
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,200
- But we have one question for you.
- Yes?

1146
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,530
[There's something else?]

1147
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:40,080
If you want to keep all ten pieces
of the gold to yourself

1148
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,840
then you just have to shut the lid,
and walk out of here right now.

1149
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,710
[What kind of an unexpected
event is this?]

1150
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,700
- There are ten of you here right now.
- I wouldn't put it past him to do it.

1151
01:14:53,250 --> 01:15:00,140
But if you want this to be a group victory,
then just pass out the gold to other members.

1152
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,810
[If he chooses friendship instead,
then he can share the gold with others.]

1153
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:05,560
- What are you even hesitating about?
- Why are you even hesitating?

1154
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,600
You worked hard, too,
but we brought you the victory.

1155
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,280
Wait, stop straining your hands.

1156
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,910
I even bled for you.

1157
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,290
But I feel like there are other ways
I can make up for that.

1158
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,930
- There are other shows in the future.
- Don't you remember us being a team?

1159
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,610
- It's my decision to make, right?
- Yes.

1160
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,880
[The decision is Big-nose's to make!]

1161
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,450
Five...

1162
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,910
[Will it be the friendship...]

1163
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,170
[Or the gold?]

1164
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,730
[What will Big-nose choose?]

1165
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:44,330
[My friends, who have worked so hard
all day to help me obtain my victory...]

1166
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:47,940
[Even in the face of all the drenching,
and the punishments...]

1167
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:52,990
[And even through the sacrifice
of their own bodies...]

1168
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:59,070
[With the singular goal of
helping me obtain my victory...]

1169
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,390
[We've worked together as a team
to work towards one singular goal...]

1170
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:07,450
[I'll see you guys next week.]

1171
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,900
You've all just been used!

1172
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,160
- I told you that I wouldn't put it past him.
- We totally got used.

1173
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,240
He's not going to give it to us
after the cameras stop rolling?

1174
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,410
No, that's not going to happen.

1175
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,130
- He's getting in his car right now!
- His manager was waiting out front.

1176
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,120
Isn't he going to come back in here?

1177
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:35,470
[Did Suk Jin seriously just leave?]
- I think he really left.

1178
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:40,540
Anyway, thank you to our three guests
for coming on our show today!

1179
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:43,220
[Even though Big-nose may have left, a
huge thanks to Woo Bin, Junho, and Ha Neul!]
