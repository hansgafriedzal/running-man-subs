our dreams and friendship.]

[But...]

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,170
[Someone stole those dreams?]

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,290
[The identity of a black hand
that destroys their friendship.]

5

<i>Today, you're here
to bury a time capsule</i>

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,190
<i>with new students
who are as pretty as flowers.</i>

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,420
- They're pretty!
- There are four girls!

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,030
It seems like a group blind date!

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,250
They're wearing uniforms!
It's exciting!

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,990
- They're almost here.
- By the way there are four girls.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,630
<i>- Park Ye Jin!
- My heart is fluttering.</i>

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,550
Nice to meet you Jin Seo.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,670
We've met Se Kyung and Ye Jin before.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,810
- This is the first time seeing you.
- This is the first time being here.

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,870
He hasn't changed at all!

24
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,870
- That's not it!
[Just the same as 'Family Outing.']

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,570
It's in the song lyrics, too.
A woman you don't know is beautiful.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,590
A woman you met for the first time.

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,670
It's been a long time, Se Kyung.

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,010
She's still pretty.

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,230
- What's your beauty secret?
- She's captivating.

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,870
- Thank you.
- You're prettier now.

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,710
The woman you met for the
second time.

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,710
How did you know that?

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,010
A woman we met for the first time,
the woman we haven't met for a while

34
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,390
the woman we used to see every week,
the woman we see very often.

35
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,010
Very distinctive.

36
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,590
<i>I'll announce the partners you'll be
with for your high school journey.</i>

37
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,630
- But there are four girls.
- We have more boys.

38
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,710
Which means we'll have a boys couple.
Why do you do that?

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,710
They are standing next to each other.

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,830
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,810
The Easy Brothers haven't been
together for a while.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,130
You never know what will happen.

43

<i>Yoon Jin Seo, who you met
for the first time will be...</i>

44

- Jong Kook!

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,160
<i>the partner of Kim Jong Kook.</i>

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,330
Jong Kook, find your lifetime partner
through Running Man.

47
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,470
- Get married!
- She's Jong Kook's type.

48
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,970
- He's acting differently today.
- Help Jong Kook.

49
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,790
Jin Seo, please
think of him as a man.

50
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,250
- You're his type.
- It's true.

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,890
Jong Kook seems nervous.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,750
You look good together.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,250
I always say this,
but he's an easy man.

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,780
Just tell him that you like him.

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,910
Don't make her feel uncomfortable.

56
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,010
<i>Shin Se Kyung's partner will be...</i>

57
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,010
I think it's me.

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,830
Who said that?

59
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,590
I have a good feeling.

60
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,030
- Is it Jae Suk?
- Gary thinks it's him.

61
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,670
<i>That's right.
It's Gary.</i>

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,410
- See? I was right.
- It really is Gary.

63
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,810
They can't be a couple anyway.

64
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,990
I'm getting worried.

65
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,990
This is not good.

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,680
<i>Park Ye Jin's partner will be...</i>

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,920
<i>Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,070
[Lee Kwang Soo and Park Ye Jin.]

69
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,150
What is this?

70
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,470
[How could it be?]

71
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,190
- I'm disappointed.
- What are you doing?

72
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,130
He's my prince.

73
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,590
- How can Ye Jin...
- Ji Hyo!

74
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,010
- Ji Hyo!
- I'll be nice to you.

75
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,010
I'm really close to her.

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,570
- We teamed up so many times.
- She's my best friend!

77
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,570
Get off of me!

78
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,570
Come here, Ji Hyo.

79
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,390
- Ji Hyo is very beautiful today.
- Mister!

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,610
Why in English?

81
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,830
<i>You are so beautiful to me.</i>

82
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,630
It should be me.
Stop this already!

83
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,260
What do you mean stop?

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,310
I've been Suk Jin's partner
so many times.

85
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,950
I don't like you, either.
This is annoying!

86
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,310
<i>Song Ji Hyo's partner is...</i>

87
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,390

88

<i>Ha Ha!</i>

89

[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo.]

90
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,910
[Jae Suk and Big-nose.]

91
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,570
Are we the expelled students?

92
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,570
Are we suspended from school?

93
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,690
We're gathered to bury
the time capsule today.

94
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,290
[Today is the day
to bury our the time capsule?]

95
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,220
We might bury you instead.

96
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,130
Be careful!
We're not very happy today.

97
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,050
We'll bury a time capsule
and open it in 10 years.

98
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,610
There happened to be
ten white stones here.

99
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,030
One stone for each of us?

100
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,170
Each of us will take a stone.
These will be our friendship stones.

101
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,730
Okay, let's do that.

102
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,110
Let's make a wish,
and put the stone in this box.

103
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,530
You first, Jae Suk.

104
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,070
I hope Jong Kook gets married soon.

105
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,510
What are you doing?

106
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,550
Suk Jin.

107
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,770
I want to invest in stocks...
What's wrong with that?

108
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,450
What's wrong with you?

109
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,450
I can share the information with you.

110
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,450
What kind of a high school
student are you?

111
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,910
- You're corrupted already.
- Just do well yourself!

112
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,410
I wish Suk Jin will still be alive
to open these.

113
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,190
Why would you say that?
He'll be in his 20's.

114
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,370
I wish Jong Kook finds his
companion and settles down.

115
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,370
Why are you saying that?

116
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,570
- I wish this continues...
- He's shy.

117
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,870
Tell Jin Seo your heart.

118
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,710
All of a sudden, he looks serious.

119
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,010
Jin Seo...

120
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,090
I hope we stay the same
and see each other...

121
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,890
It's like he's proposing to her.

122
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,730
- even after ten years.
- I've never seen him like this before.

123
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,430
Hope you'll meet a good person.

124
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,170
[Oh no.]

125
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,130
- I just said he'll meet a good person!
- Wow, Jin Seo...

126
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,790
I wish everyone will be
happy and healthy.

127
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,930
This is how a high school
student should be.

128
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,110
- She has a heart of a girl.
- I mean it.

129
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,830
I agree with Se Kyung,
be happy and healthy.

130
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,830
Do high school students
talk like that?

131
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,370
- I agree with Se Kyung...
- It's Kwang Soo's turn.

132
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,530
- I wish everyone's dreams will come true.
- Ok!

133
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,530
Pop!

134
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,790
[The ten friendship stones.]

135
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,850
[See you in twenty years...]
- It's pretty soft.

136
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,040
- It's good!
[They buried it together...]

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,150
- Cover it.
- Let's pray for our dreams.

138
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,390
I hope they don't redevelop this area.

139
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,470
[The Running High's Warren Buffett,
Big-nose.]

140
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,470
Congratulations on your graduation!

141

- See you in ten years!
- Let's meet in ten years!

<i>How have you been?</i>

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,030
Let's dig up the time capsule!

148
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,970
- Is our friendship tree there?
- It's the same.

149
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,090
There were ten white stones.

150
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,090
Why does this sign look new?

151
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,050
[He dug it up so fast!]

152
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,130
- Be careful!
- I think it moved up near the surface.

153
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,870
I wonder if it's the same?

154
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,030
[How will the time capsule be?]
- It looks old.

155
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,790
[They opened it.]

156
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,930
It hasn't changed.

157
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,710
- One is missing!
- Are you sure?

158
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,990
[One is missing?]

159
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,810
[There are nine stones only?]
- Did someone dig it out first?

160

- Who took it?
- Who is it?

161
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,590
- One is missing?
- Someone must have dug it up.

162

[Someone broke their promise.]
- Who took it?

163
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,190
- We promised not to dig it up.
- No wonder.

A ghost is among us!

167
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,170
You're the most suspicious one.

168
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,710
- Do you see what we don't see?
- No, no.

169

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,810
<i>Today's race is 'The Secret Alumni'</i>

174
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,910
<i>'The Culprit is Among Us!' race.</i>

175
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,790
<i>One of the stones that was
in the time capsule is missing.</i>

176
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,790
<i>That stone is a meteorite</i>

177
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,850
<i>and it's worth a fortune.</i>

178
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,970
No wonder!

179
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,950
<i>The culprit who knew where it was
buried is amongst you.</i>

180
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,310
<i>From now on,
you need to find the culprit.</i>

181
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,930
<i>You'll win if you reveal
who the culprit is</i>

182
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,690
<i>before the race is over.</i>

183
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,510
<i>You'll be awarded with the money
according to the meteorite's value.</i>

184
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,450
A meteorite is expensive.
It's like winning the lottery.

185
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,630
<i>You can spot someone as the culprit
at the end of each mission.</i>

186
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,570
<i>The first and the second
team will spot them.</i>

187
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,050
<i>If one of the two suspects
is the culprit</i>

188
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,630
<i>you will win the race.</i>

189
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,630
We can end the race in one mission.

190
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,190
This means someone
touched the meteorite?

191
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,730
- Lee Kwang Soo is suspicious.
- I'm not the culprit!

192
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,390
The culprit will try
and win the missions.

193
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,770
- Is that you?
- I always try to win!

194
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,910
Someone who tries really
hard is the culprit.

195
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,650
- Being too quiet is suspicious, too.
- Se Kyung!

196
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,850
I think Se Kyung is the culprit.

197
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,910
[Who stole the meteorite?]

198
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,090
- We don't have mercy.
- We'll do our best.

199
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,110
We don't care who the culprit is.

200
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,910
We'll check during the break, too.

201
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,030
- Don't do anything suspicious!
- Se Kyung is suspicious.

202
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,030
She doesn't speak at all.

203
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,110
One of the guests might be the culprit.

204
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,010
- You're the most suspicious one.
- Why me?

205
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,010
We might find out right away.

206
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,010
See you soon.

207
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,370
- Yoon Jin Seo, you're suspicious!
- I'm watching you!

208
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,190
[Alone time with Jong Kook,
Jin Seo...]

209
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,830
- I feel relieved to be on your team.
- Really?

210
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,510
- Why? Are you the culprit?
- No, it's because you're good at games.

211
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,250
Are you nervous or something?
You don't want to get caught, right?

212
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,230
- I think you're a distrustful person.
- No, I'm not.

213
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,850
You're not the one, are you?

214
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,390
I don't even understand
what the rules are.

215
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,390
The rules weren't that complicated.

216
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,890
It's because you're used to
the games.

217
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,230
If it's you, I'll be shocked.

218
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,650
No, I'll be shocked if it's you.

219
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,810
- I'm serious.
- We're not the culprits, then.

220
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,810
- I'm not the culprit, seriously!
- Me, neither!

221
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,290
It could be one of the guests.

222
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,290
You think so?
I'm not the one.

223
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,290
- Really?
- I'm not.

224
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,210
Tell me ahead of time,
if I have to win a mission for you.

225
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,210
Do you think I'm the culprit?

226
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,930
If you're the culprit,
you have to win the missions.

227
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,510
- Am I wrong?
- I don't have to win.

228
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,430
[I'm not sure about Se Kyung.]

229
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,430
Trust me, Gary.

230
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,250
I kept trusting Kwang Soo
for three years...

231
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,890
and he tricked me all the time.

232
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,010
Now, I can't trust him in real life.

233
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,610
I'm too used to his lies.

234
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,910
[They're suspecting the female guests.]

235
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:49,590
[Is one of them the culprit?]

236
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,950
[While the members were
changing into their uniforms.]

237
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,430
[The meteorite was in
an unidentifiable hand.]

238
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,810
[Shin Se Kyung is
carrying the meteorite.]

239
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,230
- Can I just hide it in my clothes?
[Why would she?]

240
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,330
I'm really bad at this.

241
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,870
[Whose voice is that?]

242
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,130
I hate the mafia game the most.

243
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,430
[Park Ye Jin joined her?]

244
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,490
Me, too.
It just shows on my face.

245
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,770
Maybe the guys will
suspect each other.

246
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,870
[Even Yoon Jin Seo is here.]

247
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,810
Are we spies today?

248
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,610
[Song Ji Hyo, too?]

249
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,670
We're a team, right?

250
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:47,050
[They're the partners in crime.]
- Let's not betray each other.

251
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,910
[The female students have
teamed up to steal the meteor.]

252
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,850
<i>Your mission is not to
get caught from the boys</i>

253
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,230
<i>and keep the stone until the end.
Then, you'll win this race.</i>

254
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>When you win</i>

255
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,730
<i>you'll win millions of Wons,
the money worth it's value.</i>

256
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,230
It's not millions of Wons
per person, isn't it?

257
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,330
We'll have to share it, right?

258
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,170
Se Kyung, since when
were you like this?

259
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,670
[Was she really a hidden card shark?]

260
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,730
<i>Before all the missions are over</i>

261
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:28,670
<i>each of you have to have
a turn keeping the stone.</i>

262
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,950
In short, let's say they doubt me

263
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,810
but we'll be fine if I give it to
someone else before I go up.

264
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,510
Who wants to keep it first?

265
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,590
[No one wants to be the first keeper.]

266
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,630
Rock, paper, scissors?

267
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,970
It feels like it's a bad thing to keep.
Let's give it to the winner first.

268
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,670
[It makes sense.]

269
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,130
Rock, paper, scissors!

270
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,590
[Shin Se Kyung wins!]

271
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,590
Se Kyung!

272
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,830
I usually lose when I play this.

273
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,290
This is so funny!

274
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,990
Here it is.

275
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,770
[The first keeper is
Shin Se Kyung.]

276
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,250
[Will she be able to
defeat the pressure?]

277
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,250
Go, girls, go!
We're on the same team.

278
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,250
One, two, three!
Let's go!

279
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,330
[Boys vs. Girls.]
[Who will win the meteorite?]

280
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,870
[Currently, the meteorite is
in Shin Se Kyung's hand.]

281
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,290
[Will girls' meteorite relay
be successful?]

282
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,630
[Jin Seo with Mr. Capable is...]
- I want to survive with you.

283
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,480
I think you... are the culprit.

284
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,270
Pardon?

285
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,050
We're on the same team.
We shouldn't suspect each other.

286
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,090
That's right.

287
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:52,110
It's not that I'm suspecting you,
but you have to suspect everyone.

288
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,450
- I've been tricked by actresses.
- Oh, really?

289
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,750
Actresses are good at acting.

290
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,430
[Here's another one.]

291
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,230
- I think it's Se Kyung.
- Se Kyung?

292
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,450
She wasn't talking before
the meteorite was stolen.

293
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,110
All of a sudden...

294
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,230
But she's not very used
to variety shows.

295
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,250
It's possible that she started talking

296
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,790
just not to be suspected.

297
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,070
That's possible.

298
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,570
[Se Kyung is in danger!]

299
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,910
I don't think it's one person.

300
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,470
They told us to pick two suspects.

301
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,770
It might even be three people.

302
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,330
But it could be one person, too.

303
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,970
One person can easily get caught.

304
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,310
[He's sharp.]
- I was looking at Jin Seo.

305
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,110
I'm sure it's either
Se Kyung or Jin Seo.

306
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,530
They look suspicious to me.
Or even Ye Jin...

307
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,930
[How can I help Se Kyung?]

308
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,030
[The marked girl, Se Kyung is...]
- You're at a good age to date.

309
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,990
- Isn't it?
- That's right.

310
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,070
At your age, you say
'Good night, dream of me.'

311
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,130
I'd rather not date anyone.

312
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,650
You don't do that?
You're not the cutesy type?

313
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,650
I don't have child-like charms.

314
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,550
I think you do.

315
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,230
You just did it.

316
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,230
That's called acting cute.

317
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,430
You never said,
'Good night, dream of me'?

318
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,830
No, but isn't that too corny?

319
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,450
I said stuff like
'See you in my dreams.'

320
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,450
You've never did that?

321
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,450
Never?

322
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,250
You like to touch people
in a friendly way, right?

323
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,250
- Do I?
- I think you do.

324
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,570
I'm that type of person.

325
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,950
Men are simple.
They delude easily.

326
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,230
- Why is she doing this to me?
[Look who's talking.]

327
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,790
Especially, Kwang Soo does.
Try him.

328
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,110
- Does he like that kind of stuff?
- He'll text you when he gets home.

329
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,610
'Wasn't the shooting
too tiring for you?'

330
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,550
He might even feel responsible.

331
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,190
[How will she attack the simple men?]

332
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,910
[Suwon Worldcup
Artificial Grass Stadium]

333
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,630
Yoon Jin Seo is suspicious.

334
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,050
- It's not me.
- I'll pick you if I win.

335
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,310
- She's not.
- Park Ye Jin, are you not?

336
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,650
I don't think she's
likely to be the culprit.

337
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,690
She's not very competitive.

338
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,230
Wait until the battle begins.

339
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,650
[The meteorite keeper,
Se Kyung arrives.]

340
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,650
[She hid the meteorite in her pocket.]

341
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,030
[Will she be able to keep the secret?]

342
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,730
What is the mission?

343
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,290
<i>The first game of 'The Secret Alumni'
is 'The retro sunflower.'</i>

344
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,250
<i>You will stand on each of
the petals of the sunflower</i>

345
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,950
<i>facing your partners.</i>

346
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,850
<i>One of the team members
has to get the mask in the middle</i>

347
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,150
<i>run to your partner,
and stand on the petal together.</i>

348
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,310
<i>You'll win when you wear the mask.</i>

349
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,290
It's absolutely advantageous
for Jong Kook.

350
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,190
- Why do you think I'll win?
- We need to join forces!

351
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,710
[For this game, there will be
a lot of physical contact.]

352
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,050
<i>Your mission is not to
get caught from the boys</i>

353
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,730
<i>and keep the stone until the end.
Then, you'll win this race.</i>

354
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,210
[I didn't expect this...]

355
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,310
Do I have to fight again?

356
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,150
Should I play not too hard?

357
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,050
[Is it a time-out?]
- It's still suspicious either way.

358
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,070
You're already suspected.

359
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,650
I knew it.
They're really quick.

360
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,950
[Jae Suk is looking at us.]
- Just do what you can.

361
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,670
[They pretend that they chatted lightly.]
- I don't know.

362
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,990
[Thanks to Ye Jin, he doesn't doubt.]
- I don't think it matters where we stand.

363
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,770
[We need to be careful.]

364
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,770
It's about getting a rebound,
or going straight to the center.

365
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,880
Bad players will go to the center!

366
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,690
<i>The men's round!</i>

367
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,670
Go, Gary, go!

368
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,630
[The cutest cheer.]

369
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,880
Go, Gary, go!

370
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,890
[It's very effective!]
- Catch this, Se Kyung!

371
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,890
Catch what?

372
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,190
She said she doesn't do cute stuff.
But she does!

373
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,730
Ye Jin, try being cute!
She hates it the most.

374
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,170
- Try Ye Jin.
- Go, prince, go!

375
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,950
Where is the prince?

376
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,550
[Ye Jin's nasally voice melts down
the Prince of Asia's heart.]

377
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,610
Kwang Soo!

378
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,850
Ji Seo is next.

379
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,750
Come quickly!

380
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll do my best.

381
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,750
He's going to go quickly.

382
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,790
Jin Seo has a quivering voice.

383
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,470
Go, Jae Suk, go!

384
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,110
Come here, honey!

385
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,610
This is clearly a business relationship.

386
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,250
- Come here, honey!
[Oh, my eyes!]

387
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,270
<i>The men's round starts!</i>

388
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,590
Gary seems like he will do his best.

389
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,650
[Giraffe catches the mask first.]

390
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,670
[The Giraffe tower.]

391
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,510
[Everyone is jumping
for the Giraffe tower.]

392
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,390
Make Kwang Soo sit!
The four of you can do it.

393
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,570
That's right.

394
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,910
No!

395
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,350
Kwang Soo, no!

396
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,350
No!

397
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,610
[Ha Ha is fishing in troubled waters.]

398
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,930
[He runs straight to Ji Hyo.]

399
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,290
[Ha Ha wins the first round easily.]
- It's awesome!

400
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,770
- What happened?
- We did it!

401
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,790
- It's amazing.
- It's weird.

402
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,790
We need to watch for spies carefully.

403
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,190
- There's a reason that Ha Ha's desperate.
- I think they let me take it.

404
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,170
That's right.

405
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,270
We need to doubt the one
that plays too hard.

406
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,130
- Ha Ha is suspicious.
- We can't be lazy!

407
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,330
[She looks more calm and composed.]

408
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,370
[It's getting easier than I thought.]

409
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,070
- Go, Se Kyung, go!
[Gary's cute cheer!]

410
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,250
- Park Ye Jin! Park Ye Jin!
[The guys cheer for their partners.]

411
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,630
Go, team, go!

412
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,430
Yoon Seo Jin, don't get hurt!

413
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,910
Go, Se Kyung!
Even if you get hurt!

414
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,590
[By the way...]

415
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,390
[I don't have to worry
about the girls...]

416
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,990
[except this girl.]

417
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,010
[Will she be able to
guard the meteorite?]

418
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,650
Go!

419
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,890
[The women's round starts.]

420
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,910
[This round won't be tough
because they're accomplices...]

421
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,090
[What's happening?]

422
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,890
[She can't get too close.]

423
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,890
Se Kyung, try getting inside.

424
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,130
[I can't take the risk.]

425
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,410
[She kept staying away,
and she sits down.]

426
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,110
[Ye Jin grabs the chance.]

427
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,310
[Her desire for winning boosted up.]

428
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,890
[Help me!]

429
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,890
Park Ye Jin reveals her true self.

430
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,670
Look at Ye Jin!

431
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,070
You're so close, Ye Jin!

432
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,610
Now she looks like herself.

433
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,830
[She only thinks about winning.]

434
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,850
[Jin Seo is squeezed out.]

435
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,850
What are you doing, Jin Seo?

436
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,630
- What is she doing?
[She attacks with sand.]

437
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,630
[What is this?]

438
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,090
[What's wrong with her?]

439
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,030
[She sits gracefully and
keeps throwing sand.]

440
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,330
- What is she doing?
- She's unbelievable.

441
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,630
[The Big-nose power!]

442
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,790
It doesn't look cool at all.

443
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,990
Ji Suk Jin!

444
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,030
Get off!

445
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,150
- Kick him!
- He's not going to look cool.

446
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,350
- Grab his leg.
- Get off!

447
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,010
Wow, women...

448
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,150
Don't let go!

449
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,530
She stepped on it.

450
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,390
[Kwang Soo and Ye Jin win.]

451
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,750
- Ye Jin is scary.
- It's scary.

452
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,710
[Ye Jin completely changes
her attitude when playing games.]

453
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,210
Are you okay?

454
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,490
Yoon Jin Seo!

455
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,630
[The human fork-lift.]

456
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,430
It was great!
Good job!

457
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,190
You haven't been on
many variety shows?

458
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,350
- It's my first time.
- Is it her first time?

459
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,450
Throwing out sand is
what the culprit would do.

460
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,070
[A growing doubt.]
- It's a dirty action.

461
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,070
When people are cornered...

462
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,410
[Ji Seo turns their doubt toward her.]

463
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,710
[Don't worry, Se Kyung.
I'll take the suspicion.]

464
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,710
Good! Jae Suk grabbed it.

465
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,090
[I'll do it for her!]

466
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,090
No, no!

467
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,690
- Here, here.
- Se Kyung!

468
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,530
[Come on!]

469
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,970
[They scream loudly,
but they stay the same.]

470
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,230
[The sunflower mask is ripped.]
- It's ripped!

471
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,350
What should we do?

472
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,730
I did it!

473
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,390
[It's not how you do it.]

474
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,770
[Kwang Soo holds Jong Kook's pants.]

475
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,950
[Again?]

476
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,150
[Ha Ha fishing in
troubled waters again!]

477
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,650
[Ha Ha was very quick to win.]

478
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,470
See?
We're a good team!

479
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,790
<i>Ha Ha and Ji Hyo are the winners!</i>

480
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,190
[They can point out the suspect.]

481
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,070
[I'm counting on you!]

482
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,030
[Ok! Don't worry.]

483
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,470
I think Jin Seo is hiding something.

484
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,470
It's not how you wear it.

485
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,470
Don't wear it like that!

486
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,470
You looked like a small octopus.

487
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,890
- This is not?
- She's strange.

488
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,110
- She's suspicious.
- But your head goes in from there?

489
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,330
- It's not big enough.
[It's as I planned.]

490
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,070
[Jong Kook and Jin Seo, Kwang Soo
and Ye Jin each scored one point.]

491
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,330
[The Tiger's rush!]

492
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,250
It's a foul!
He punched him!

493
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,550
He bit him.

494
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,270
[Everybody screams.]

495
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,790
- It's not even funny!
[Great number of zombies appear.]

496
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,790
They are zombies.

497
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,350
They're putting so much effort.

498
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,110
[Jae Suk puts his foot in the mask.]

499
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,670
[Even the viewers can feel the pain.]

500
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,930
[The mask is in the crotch
and he runs to Suk Jin.]

501
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,770
[But he gets dragged.]

502
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,890
[They fight for the mask.]

503
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,910
[At the moment all men
share the pain...]

504
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,850
You heartless bastards!

505
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,670
Kwang Soo, you're almost here.

506
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,190
[Just one more step...]

507
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,270
[He falls on the petal
and moves his legs quickly.

508
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,730
[Kwang Soo and Ye Jin win.]

509
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,490
[They can point out the suspect.]

510
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,730
- It's over.
- You heartless bastards!

511
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,530
['The retro sunflower' is over.]

512
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,670
[The current meteorite
keeper, Se Kyung.]

513
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,230
<i>It's time to point out the suspects.</i>

514
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,070
<i>Please check if there are
ten envelopes in your bags.</i>

515
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,130
Two, four, six, eight...
It's correct.

516
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,210
Yes, I have.

517
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,210
<i>I'll tell you how much
each envelope is worth later.</i>

518
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,210
<i>You wouldn't want to lose them.</i>

519
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:04,490
<i>The first and second winners
don't have to bet their envelopes</i>

520
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,730
<i>and you can point out the suspects.</i>

521
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,190
<i>You can all make deductions.</i>

522
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,430
<i>Even if you're not the real culprit</i>

523
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,070
<i>you'll lose five envelopes
when you're pointed out.</i>

524
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,210
[Deduction time?]

525
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,990
[If she gets pointed at,
the game is over.]

526
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,710
I think Se Kyung is suspicious.

527
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,430
<i>Se Kyung is suspicious...</i>

528
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,770
[Se Kyung is in danger!]

529
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,330
[You got caught, Se Kyung!]
- Se Kyung didn't talk at all.

530
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,550
<i>[She kept staying away
during the game play.]</i>

531
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,070
<i>[She's acting differently today.]</i>

532
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,310
- Is there just one culprit?
- She's suspicious.

533
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,090
[Shin Se Kyung is in a crisis!]

534
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,590
Who do you think the culprit is?

535
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,010
I think it's Kwang Soo...

536
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,130
Let's pick Jin Seo.

537
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,650
<i>I don't think she knows
what's going on.</i>

538
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,730
Whoever we pick has to
give up five envelopes.

539
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,190
- I think Ye Jin is suspicious too.
- She's even more suspicious now.

540
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,750
You're really weird.

541
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,130
- Me?
- She's just being honest.

542
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,190
[Thank you, Jin Seo.]

543
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,430
<i>Who wants to spot the culprit first?</i>

544
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,330
We'll go first.

545
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,890
<i>When I count to three,
say 'the person's name, get out!'</i>

546
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,970
<i>One, two, three!</i>

547
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,970
Yoon Jin Seo, get out!

548
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,530
[He chooses Jin Seo.]

549
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,930
Jin Seo.

550
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,270
[I'm safe.]

551
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,490
Go to that side and stay.

552
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,250
The woman who threw the sand.

553
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,990
[She's celebrating with sand.]

554
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,950
What's with you?

555
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,890
She does it habitually!

556
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,100
She acts like a child.

557
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,670
I used to have friends like that
when I was young.

558
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,550
<i>Open your bag</i>

559
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,410
<i>and give us back five envelopes.</i>

560
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,150
- What a loss.
- But you were too suspicious.

561
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,710
It's fine, Jin Seo.
We can get it back at the end.

562
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,350
I'll spot the second person.

563
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,230
The second person?

564
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,670
<i>Say the name after
I count to three.</i>

565
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,010
[Ha Ha is sure it's Jae Suk.]

566
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,150
<i>- Are you ready, Ha Ha?
- Yes.</i>

567
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,770
<i>One, two, three!</i>

568
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,290
Yoo Jae Suk, get out!

569
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,910
[The first round's
secret mission is successful.]

570
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,910
Hey, you!

571
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,170
You're supposed to find the culprit!

572
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,350
Nobody put that much effort.

573
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,510
[Jae Suk staked his all on the game.]

574
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,670
[He passionately played for the game
but Ha Ha suspects him.]

575
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,670
This is frustrating.

576
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,390
It's not Jae Suk.

577
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,250
- It's so frustrating, Jin Seo.
- I know, right?

578
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,210
I must win the next round.

579
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,770
Five of them, right?
[Jae Suk returns five envelopes.]

580
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,770
[The final reveal.]

581
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,780
<i>The two couples who didn't win</i>

582
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,310
<i>need to return two envelopes.</i>

583
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,270
- It's fine, Jin Seo.
[Two envelopes are nothing to me.]

584
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,850
Jong Kook, she might be the culprit.

585
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,550
Wait for the next round.
It won't be easy for you.

586
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,130
- I lost five envelopes.
- You're irritated and that's suspicious.

587
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,130
We've decided.

588
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,130
Do one of you...

589
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,670
have the meteorite?

590
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,270
[Do one of you have the meteorite?]

591
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,830
[If one of them has it,
the red light will be on.]

592
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,990
- They're not?
- I told you we're not!

593
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,990
You don't have it?

594
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,370
[She's acting like she's shocked.]
- I told you I don't have it!

595
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,590
I think the culprit is
amongst the winning teams.

596
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,090
- It wasn't you, Jin Seo?
- I said I don't have it.

597
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,170
Can we only judge once per game?

598
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,750
The culprit is among those four.

599
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,590
I said I'm not the culprit.

600
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,430
It's clear now.
We won't doubt you any longer.

601
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,510
- Aren't you thankful to us?
- What about my envelopes!

602
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,910
Do I have to get confirmed
by losing my envelopes?

603
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,170
Say thank you because
you could prove your innocence.

604
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,830
<i>Your dividends will be confiscated.</i>

605
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,830
I'll pick you again, if I win.

606
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,750
- I see how it is.
- Let's pick a couple next time.

607
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,330
[It'll be the safest to hand over
the meteorite to Jin Seo.]

608
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,390
[Se Kyung bravely gets
close to Jin Seo.]

609
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,490
[It's successfully handed over.]

610
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,790
[The meteorite is in Jin Seo's pocket.]

611
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,550
[Will she be able to hide it?]

612
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,270
[The current meteor keeper,
Yoon Jin Seo.]

613
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,270
Who do you think it is?

614
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,810
- I thought Jin Seo was the culprit.
- Me, too.

615
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,030
- She was really strange.
- But she's not.

616
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,130
Let's pick one person each.

617
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,130
For now, I'll pick Kwang Soo.

618
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,790
Me, too.
Is there another person?

619
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,790
Are you really not the culprit?

620
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,650
I'm not the culprit.
I'm serious.

621
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,670
- Can you trust me now?
- Of course.

622
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,730
- I trusted you.
- No, you didn't trust me.

623
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,790
- You tried to interrogate me.
- No, I didn't.

624
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,570
I kept asking Se Kyung.

625
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,830
- She said she's not.
- She might not be the one.

626
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,970
It's too obvious if one of
the guests is the culprit.

627
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,830
[But you can't figure out the obvious.]

628
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,830
It wasn't Jin Seo...

629
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,810
I think it's Kwang Soo.

630
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,270
Kwang Soo had the shovel
and everything.

631
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,330
I'll point him out
if I win again.

632
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,650
Kwang Soo has to win the games.

633
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,670
Even if we could catch Kwang Soo,
I think there's another person.

634
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,670
- Two people?
- Yes, I'm sure.

635
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,910
But we only have one meteorite.

636
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,690
[We've got to be careful with Ha Ha.]
- Only one meteorite.

637
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,710
[They arrive at the next mission site
while they're guessing the culprits.]

638
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,510
[Will they be able to catch
the culprit this time?]

639
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,990
We talked about who could it be.
We think it's you.

640
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,870
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- What are you talking about?

641
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,870
It's you, Lee Kwang Soo.

642
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,410
I'm absolutely not!

643
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,610
We think it's you, too.

644
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,030
Why is everyone suspecting you?

645
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,030
I don't know why.

646
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,030
Then who do you think it is?

647
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,910
- I think it's either Gary or...
- What? It's you!

648
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,030
Do I look that easy to you?

649
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,290
Out of all people, you picked Gary?

650
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,830
Either Gary or who?

651
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,410
Honestly, I think it's
either Ji Hyo or Se Kyung.

652
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,330
[Look at this Giraffe!
He only points out girls.]

653
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,310
What about Gary then?
Are you losing your mind?

654
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,270
Is it possible to point out
the same person again?

655
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,190
[What's with Kwang Soo today?
He even points out Jin Seo again.]

656
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,310
- He's not thinking straight.
- Go ahead and play the game.

657
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,190
- Should I go first?
- You better do your best.

658
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,950

<i>'Girls over flowers.'</i>

661
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,790
<i>We'll show you a word, and the girls
have to explain with gestures.</i>

662
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,910
<i>The guys have to be on
the bar behind the wall.</i>

663
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,790
<i>You have to do chin-ups
and guess the word.</i>

664
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,150
<i>The girls will be standing here
and explain it.</i>

665
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,790
<i>Each couple can only
pass the question twice.</i>

666
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,230
<i>You have one minute
for five questions.</i>

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,230
<i>It's the same as before.
The first and the second team</i>

668
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,230
will get to choose the suspects
and keep their envelopes.

669
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,870
<i>Please decide who will go first.</i>

670
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,500
- Lee Kwang Soo will go first.
- What? That's so unfair!

671
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,770
Don't we need to play rock,
paper, scissors?

672
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,970
[Will Giraffe be able
to tell their secrets?]

673
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,030
It's going to be easy for Jong Kook.

674
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,410
No, it's not.
This can't be easy to anymore.

675
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,450

You know it's hard for everyone.

great advantage to her.

00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,910

- What are you doing, Jin Seo?
- Isn't it really easy?

682
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,270
- Pass!

00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,340
They're not it.

1034
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,100
This is shocking.

1035
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,880
I don't like how I'm mistrusted!

1036
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,960
Then why did you behave like
the culprit?

1037
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,980
What did I do?

1038
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,710
[Haroro is consulting Ji Hyo,
who has been acquitted.]

1039
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,050
I'm not it, Ji Hyo.

1040
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,440
- Se Kyung is it!
- No...

1041
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,000
[She's diverting the suspicion
with her comment.]

1042
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,510
How about Ye Jin?

1043
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,260
[Too late now!]

1044
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,360
[Will Ye Jin manage to keep the meteorite
throughout the next mission?]

1045
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,420
[Park Ye Jin has the meteorite now!]

1046
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,290
This stadium got nicer!
[Suwon Baseball Stadium]

1047
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,600
- It feels like broad daylight!
- This is a great stadium.

[The ultra-modern, dream stage]

1049
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,250
[What will be the final mission here?]

1050
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,940
What is that?

1051
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,720
[The scoreboard is decorated by
hearts and flowers]

1052
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,110
<i>- The third mission of Secret Alumni...
[Balloons on the ground?]</i>

1053

1054
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:40,740
<i>When there's a break between innings, the
scoreboard often shows couples and kissing.</i>

1055
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,140
<i>We got the idea from that.</i>

1056
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,180
<i>You'll see those balloons on the ground.</i>

1057
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,490
<i>One of these balloons will appear
inside of that heart.</i>

1058
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,260
<i>Then we'll take the picture.</i>

1059
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,340

in 30 seconds.</i>

1060

of that heart when the picture is taken will win.</i>

[Smiles]

1062
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,770
What about us?

1063
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,610

1064
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,190
Is that important?

[He will be Big-nosed Sister this time]

[I can't drop the meteorite while running...]

1069
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,780
The tricky part is that
there are three balloons per color.

1070
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,040
You must use your judgment
to find the right one.

1071
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,100
We should approach this strategically.

1072
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,200
[Peeking]

1073
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,460
- We must stop the culprit.
- Stop whom?

1074
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,530
- We must know first in order to stop.
- I think it's Se Kyung...

1075
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,660
- We must be suspicious of Ye Jin too.
- That's right.

1076
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,280
[Hear, hear, Kwang Soo]

1077
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,150
[Nervous]

1078
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,870
Now that he got scanned once,
he wants me to do it!

1079
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:01,170
[Nothing better than blaming Kwang Soo
to deflect suspicion!]

1080
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,840
He keeps acting like it's him.

1081
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,990
[Thank you for being here, Kwang Soo.]

1082
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,680
Shall we?

[Moving to the start line]

1084

Do you have it?

1085
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,970
Yes.

1086
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,910
This investigation will not be easy...

1087

[This is the last mission...]

00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,630
[She's worried about the meteorite]

1089

[Slipped!]

1090
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,460
[A huge accident!]

[Thank heavens.]

[I can't trust myself, Ji Hyo...]

1098
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,290
Get ready...

1099
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:08,000
- The speed is not that important.
- Red, yellow, blue...

1100
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,930
[Only one balloon will appear
on the scoreboard.]

1101
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,320
So we must run to the balloon
that appears on the board?

1102
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,010
Just grab me.

1103

a balloon appears on the board]

to the left one.]

00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,030
- This is it.
- Not the center one?

[Jae Suk and Suk Jin
are going to the one on the right]

1112

[But the scoreboard looks the same
even though they're close.]

1113

They're coming!
This is it!

1114

Is it not?
It's wavering.

1115

- We were in there!

as they could.]

[Anger of a man who
got his love interfered with.]

1139
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,550

[Sad]

- Is it on my cheek?
- Do you want me to wipe it?

there was lipstick on your cheek?

[I like the mood of this mission.]

cheeks out to those who aren't their partners.

- Who was that?
- I've warned you.

then went to someone else!

There it is!

1203
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,990
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo found it in
one try again.]

1204
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:25,830
[We won't just leave you
to be the only kissing couple!]

1205
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:33,120
[The Kissing Army is rushing
toward Ha Ha!]

1206
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,700
[It seems like they're running
out of time!]

1207
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,190
[At this rate,
it'll be their perfect victory.]

1208
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:45,230
- Come to the front!
[The male couple is late to the party.]

1209
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:54,230
[Will the shutter be faster?
Or the detractors?]

1210
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,880
[Kiss time is over.]

1211
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,760
We did it!

1212
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,310
No, we blocked you.

1213
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,850
That was no joke!

1214
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:09,620
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo are
certain of their victory.]

1215
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,600
Here it is!

1216
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,240
- We did it!
[A perfect success!]

1217
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,530
- We did it!
[Jong Kook would've blocked him a second later.]

1218
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,880
[First place for the
Kiss Time at the Ballpark Mission]

1219
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,160
Why are they so happy?

1220
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,430
What is Gary doing?

1221
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:35,850
[Waiting patiently for his kiss.]

1222
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,350
[He seems to be ready to receive it.]

1223
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,030
[Hilarious]

1224
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,650
I forced her once or twice.

1225
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,640
[Monday Couple, and their crossed fate.]

1226
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,980
So, Song Ji Hyo and Ha Ha
are the winners!

1227
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,850
[They can call on someone now.]

1228
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,710
That team is okay.

1229
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,160
Please come this way.

1230
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,820
[I must work hard too.]

1231
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:05,020
We must do something so Gary
doesn't make it.

1232
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,730
I think either Gary or Se Kyung
must be scanned this time.

1233
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:12,490
I want to put those two on there.
Ye Jin...

1234
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,490
[Suspicion points to Ye Jin again]

1235
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,480
[Ye Jin...]

1236
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,810
All I ever did was
have too many envelopes.

1237
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,530
Is that so?

1238
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,860
Let's go!

1239
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,890
[I think you're in danger]

1240
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,300
[I must do something]

1241
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:37,950
[A red balloon this time!]

1242
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:43,850
- Red...
[Which team will get it right this time?]

1243
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:50,970
- If this isn't it, we're going left.
[Jae Suk and Suk Jin run right again.]

1244
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,900
This isn't it, is it?

1245
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,290
[They're right this time!]

1246
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:59,040
This is it!

1247
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,510
- That's it!
[Swarming toward Jae Suk.]

1248
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:09,330
Block them!

1249
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:15,790
[Blocking the enemy first...]

1250
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,880
[Then kiss!]

1251
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,360
[Literally, a kissing war.]

1252
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,910
[Giraffe is acting weird]

1253
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,710
[Retaliating with another kiss!]

1254
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:36,750
[While the others are busy,
Gary and Se Kyung kiss too!]

1255
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,990
[Whose kiss was caught on camera?]

1256
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:46,620
I was so rushed, I did it
while facing backward.

1257
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,690
[This kissing war is grueling.]

1258
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,000
Here it is!

1259
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,750
- I did it backward!
[The back of his head]

1260
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,540
- You almost made it.
- I was in a rush.

1261
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,440
Did he do this on purpose?

1262
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,200
- I think he did.
[Uneasy]

1263
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,100
Isn't it suspicious that
he got his directions confused?

1264
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,350
Anyway, let's do it again!

1265
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,560
- I think Se Kyung tried her best.
[Fourth Round: I'll See You Later!]

1266
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,530
I envy you, Gary.

1267
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,960
[Fifth Round: To the blue balloon...
Go, go, go!]

1268
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,290
This is right.
Come here.

1269
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:27,730
[Get out!]

1270
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:31,750
Now is it!

1271
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,210
[Chaos ensues again]

1272
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,050
Now is it!

1273
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,390
[Quite desperate male-to-male kiss.]

1274
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,120
We did it!

1275
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,270
I think we did it!

1276
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,990
I think we did it.

1277
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:50,630
They did it!

1278
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,160
[The spectators are certain
of their success too.]

1279
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,980
Kwang Soo pushed me.

1280
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,460
I didn't push you, Se Kyung.

1281
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,360
I was going to kiss, but you pushed me!

1282
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:05,260
For him, our own kissing comes second
to pushing everyone around first.

1283
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,910
Yon can at least let us kiss first.

1284
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,940
He doesn't come near me because
he's so busy pushing people.

1285
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,450
Again, you can push people
once they kiss first.

1286
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,890
Our spot was the good one.

1287
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,620
[Time to check the picture]

1288
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,820
Everyone looks like they
had a good time.

1289
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,720
- Us, too?
- Have you seen me?

1290
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,450
I think Suk Jin is a bit thrilled.

1291
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,270
Here's the picture!

1292
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,410
[Kwang Soo and Ye Jin made it!]

1293
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,370
We were in that corner...

1294
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:40,560
Your face is that of an
australopithecus.

1295
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,480
Why am I always the only one
who's craving?

1296
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:48,600
[The man who is craving for kisses.]

1297
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,460
[Not enough yet]

1298
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,760
- Her chin line is pretty!
[Venus Who Descended Upon the Ballpark]

1299
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,650
Park Ye Jin and Lee Kwang Soo
take second place.

1300
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,460
Now that the third game is over,
we'll do the judgment.

1301
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,050
[If I can keep this until the end...]

1302
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,430
[Park Ye Jin has the meteorite
right now!]

1303
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,270
This is the last judgment.

1304
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:22,050
Take a look at the hint
and think hard.

1305
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:26,380
[Find the person who has the stone
"right now."]

1306
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:31,300
Can we search them?

1307
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,270
[No...]

1308
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,330
You?

1309
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:39,820
[If they do a body search,
her cover will be blown!]

1310
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,490
I'm sorry, but would you
please take your hat off?

1311
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,220
Try touching my hat.

1312
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,960
There's no point of searching us now.

1313
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,870
- Let's discuss.
- Gary!

1314
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,940
- Share the hint!
- I think it's a she.

1315
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:00,910
- There are co-conspirators?
- I knew it wasn't done by a single person.

1316
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,240
The hint said it's not done
by a single person.

1317
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,590
So it's not just one person.

1318
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,160
It's harder to guess two.

1319
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,260
- So we have to guess both of them?
- What was the second hint?

1320
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,700
[Giraffe starts the search]

1321
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,840
- You must tell us now.
- It's the person who has the stone right now.

1322
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,590
[Discreetly]

1323
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:24,830
[Ye Jin approaches Se Kyung]

1324
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,740
[Ye Jin?]

1325
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,310
[Perhaps...]

1326
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:35,750
[Was there a secret deal
between those two?]

1327
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:38,720
I presume the person does
have the stone.

1328
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,360
[Ye Jin's face is hard to read]

1329
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,960
[Kwang Soo's search is getting closer.]

1330
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,370
Even if the person might have the stone,
it might not be here.

1331
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,810
[He began to search Ye Jin!]

1332
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,070
[An emergency!]

1333
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,310
The stone!

1334
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,590
[Ji Hyo suddenly changes the subject!]

1335
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,570
Suk means stone.

1336
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:10,150
Yoo Jae Suk!
Ji Suk Jin!

1337
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:14,330
Yoo Jae Suk and Ji Suk Jin!

1338
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:18,040
But Jae Suk wasn't it.

1339
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,210
He didn't have the stone at the
moment, because Suk Jin had it!

1340
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:24,190
- They might have hidden the stone.
[Phew...]

1341
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:27,470
- You two are the stones!
- I'm not it!

1342
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,070
- This is weird...
- The hint said someone has the stone right now.

1343
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,820
Ji Suk Jin.
Yoo Jae Suk.

1344
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,960
This is it.
We've got them.

1345
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,680
[Time to put the suspects on
the scanner.]

1346
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,160
- What will you do?
[Teams in first and second place choose.]

1347
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,510
I'll choose Suk Jin.

1348
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,650
Okay, do that.

1349
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,630
Hold on.
Come here.

1350
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,450
[Ha Ha seems to be suspicious of Se Kyung.]

1351
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:59,110
One, two, three!

1352
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,340
Go, Ji Suk Jin!

1353
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,070
He must be the culprit.

1354
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,690
[For the girls, this is a great choice.]

1355
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,510
When you go to prison,
do repent for your crime!

1356
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:15,370
- My Lord...
- I think he's it.

1357
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:19,210
[Time to designate one more person]

1358
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,390
I think Se Kyung should go.

1359
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,830
[She is startled by the idea.]

1360
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,740
[Ye Jin's face is also serious.]

1361
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:38,690
[Right before the body search...]

1362
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,600
[Perhaps...]

1363
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,300
[Did Se Kyung receive the meteorite
from Ye Jin?]

1364
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,980
I think it's Se Kyung.

1365
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:54,080
The only thing she's been saying
the whole day is "Ahh."

1366
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,550
- You've been pretty quiet, Se Kyung.
- In the car, too...

1367
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,070
Let's do this.

1368
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,010
Go, Shin Se Kyung!

1369
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:07,800
- Se Kyung is it!
- It must be one of the two!

1370
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,490
[Ye Jin's face is getting harder to read]

1371
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:14,070
- Ji Suk Jin is it!
- No, he's faking it.

1372
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,190
I must turn in my money, right?

1373
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:19,990
[Collecting 500,000 won first]

1374
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:23,000
If it's not one of those two,
we can't take the money.

1375
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,990
If you look above,
there are flour buckets.

1376
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,480
- Where?
- Not there, Gary.

1377
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,770
- Why, are you worried?
- He was staring at the sky.

1378
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,080
[Looking for flour in the sky.]

1379
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,910
See? I can't be it!

1380
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:41,200
[If Se Kyung does have the meteorite...]

1381
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,860
[a bucket of flour will be]
dumped on her...]

1382
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,610
[and the girls will lose!]

1383
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:51,360
Ji Suk Jin, Shin Se Kyung.
Do one of you have the stone?

1384
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,990
[The fateful moment...]

1385
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,440
[Were the boys right to pick Se Kyung?]

1386
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:06,380
[Did Ye Jin give the stone
at the very last moment?]

1387
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,670
[What could be...]

1388
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,480
[the truth?]

1389
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,050
[Failed to catch the culprits!]

1390
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:30,980
[Victory of the four girls!]

1391
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,680
We've won!

1392
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,770
[Se Kyung did not have the stone!]

1393
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,920
[The meteorite is...]

1394
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,700
[Right here!]

1395
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,160
So you had the stone, Ye Jin?

1396
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,060
- I didn't have it the whole time.
- Where did you hide it?

1397
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,090
In my back pocket.
I even dropped it once!

1398
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:59,410
- I was trying to put it in a safer place...
[She almost got caught!]

1399
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:02,980
I should search
all female guests from now on.

1400
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,850
Thank you for your hard work!

1401
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:12,170
[The victorious girls get the envelopes
with money inside!]

1402
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,860
[Amazed]

1403
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,800
- You're pretty amazing.
[Blank Ji is the lucky lady.]

1404
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,920
Did you remember just now?

1405
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,450
We were all smiles when
those girls kissed us.

1406
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,950
We were seduced.

1407
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:32,540
Today's victors are
the four female classmates!

1408
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:37,690
- Well done!
[Congratulations!]

1409
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,250
The Hallyu Stars!

1410
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,570
Jung Yong Hwa, Jung Il Woo,
Lee Hong Ki...

1411
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:49,590
[All different kinds of games
created by our fans worldwide!]

1412
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:51,490
There are so many different games!

1413
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,420
How do they think of such games?

1414
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,820
- Who's next?
- I'll show you who the boss is.

1415
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:02,220
[Hallyu stars become
the boys next door.]

1416
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,270
[Mission Worldwide!]

1417
