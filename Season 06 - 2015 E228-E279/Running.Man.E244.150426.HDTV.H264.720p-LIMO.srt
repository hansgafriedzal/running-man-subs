Even when you're receiving
your punishment

will you swear to love
your husband forever?

156

[Hesitates]

158
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,680
- Why aren't you answering?
- Yes!

159
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,950

166
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,370
[Why are they eliminating
the name tags?]

167
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,000
[Emergency situation.]

168
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,270
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon's attack.]

- It's a mission!

176
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,770
[Why on earth did they attack?]

177
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,640
[There is something.]
[What is their secret?]

178
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,460
[One hour ago...]

179
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,200
We haven't had a
one-on-one meeting in a while.

180
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,750
Why are there two chairs?
Is there someone else?

181
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,080
<i>Your soon-to-be bride
will be here shortly.</i>

182
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,670
A bride?

183
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,320
[The entrance of a random foot.]

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Honey.

185
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,500
[Kkuk and Do Yeon's first meeting.]

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,220
These days, I work with
many female comedians...

187
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,130
Does your energy get sucked out?

188
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,720
What are we doing today?

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,770
<i>Out of all the couples
getting married today</i>

190
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>you are the most dangerous couple.</i>

191
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,180
[Touch for no reason.]

192
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,370
[Too much pressure started
from this moment.]

193
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,720
<i>There will be a
group wedding today.</i>

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,820
A group wedding?

195
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,350
You said group wedding,
I thought of the wedding night.

196
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,900
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, that's inappropriate on SBS.

197
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Kwang Soo's mine today!

198
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,770
What's with the heart!
It's embarrassing!

199
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,770
<i>There's going to be five other
couples at this group wedding.</i>

200
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,020
You're Jessi,
yo, I'm Yoo ssi.

201
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,810
<i>You must oust all five couples.</i>

202
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,050
Pardon?

203
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,550
- As soon as we start?
- How?

204
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,090
We have to oust them
during the opening?

205
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,950
<i>- As soon as we start?
- Yes.</i>

206
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,020
What does he mean?
Shall we do some karate?

207
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,440
<i>There will be a marriage officiant.</i>

208
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,650
<i>He will let you know
when to start eliminating.</i>

209
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,770
<i>He will start the ceremony,
then say...</i>

210
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>'If there is...'.</i>

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,040
<i>If there is anyone
who is against this marriage</i>

212
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>please step forward.</i>

213
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>As soon as you hear this</i>

214
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,980
<i>you need to eliminate
everyone's name tag.</i>

215
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,950
[All five couples are attacked.]

216
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,100
[Carrying out the name tag
hunting mission.]

217
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,750
[None of the members knew.]

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,220
[Mission complete.]
- Bravo!

219
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,940
It's a mission!

220
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,250
- Thank you.
- Good work today.

221
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,650
- The filming is done today!
- What is this?

222
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,870
It's done, we won.

223
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,820
<i>It's the dangerous couple race.</i>

224
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,250
<i>Your final mission is the wedding.</i>

225
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,140
<i>Before you even started it</i>

226
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,090
<i>you've been ousted
by the dangerous couple.</i>

227
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,320
Oh, we filmed the ending first?

228
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>You're upset, right?
Right now...</i>

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,140
<i>we are going to go back 10 hours</i>

230
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,300
<i>and carry out the mission
to decide your wedding hall.</i>

231
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,170
<i>You will be doing the other missions
and pick a wedding hall.</i>

232
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,340
<i>There is an A hall and a B hall.</i>

233
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,340
<i>You must go to the hall that
Jong Kook and Do Yeon are not in.</i>

234
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,440
<i>When the final wedding
starts again</i>

235
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:34,020
<i>the couples who choose the hall
that they're not in, will win.</i>

236
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,500
What if we make all of them
come to our hall?

237
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,540
<i>If all the couples meet
in one hall like now</i>

238
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,440
<i>this will happen again.</i>

239
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,220
<i>And the dangerous couple will win.</i>

240
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,520
Should we look at this one first?

241
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,300
Oh, they're mixing up the cards
to tell us where to go.

242
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,670
We'll need to see where they go,
and then decide later.

243
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,150
- To be with them.
- Right!

244
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,950
- Then, should we just leave them?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,720
[For now, they will keep an eye
on the other missions.]

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
[A hall is everyone's destination now.]

247
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,450
[Go back 10 hours
and change the future!]

248
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,370
[Earn the chance to change
the destination through other missions!]

249
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,780
Have you watched Running man?

250
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,620
Sure, I've watched at home.

251
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,540
- It isn't your first variety, is it?
- It is.

252
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,180
- It's your first?
- Yes.

253
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,440
I feel like it's my first filming ever.

254
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,840
- Oh, like your first drama?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,040
- Like when you...
- Yo! You want some disses?

256
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,500
- Yo grasshopper!
- I'm not grasshopper, he is.

257
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,400
- But grasshoppers are green.
- This color is for grasshoppers.

258
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,470
We are Jessi, Yoo ssi.

259
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,350
You're Ji ssi, Kim ssi.

260
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,700
Oh my god.

261
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,940
How many cc is your engine?

262
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,040
- Rhyme?
- He's kind of good.

263
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,910
- He's not good!
- Yesterday, I had 500 cc of cola.

264
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,050
[Stop now...]

265
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,520
- Jessi!
- This is a competition!

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,990
- This is a competition.
- We're not a team.

267
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,140
Say something, Yoo Ri.

268
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,330
Where are you going?

269
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,840
Oddly, the weather's always nice
when there are pretty guests.

270
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,440
The weather's really nice today.

271
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,240
Doesn't it smell like cologne?

272
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,810
- From you?
- I put on some cologne.

273
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,550
Suk Jin and I shared some cologne
because there are female guests.

274
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,420
Let's go!

275
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,900
The weather's nice and I feel great!

276
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,770
- Choa!
- Choa!

277
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,470
[Their behavior makes them
look like a young couple.]

278
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,970
It won't be that easy today.

279
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,830
It's not a great situation for us

280
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,470
so it's best not to say anything

281
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,020
like if we switched the cards,
or whatnot.

282
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,470
We need to make them think
that everything is out of order.

283
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,770
We need to match our mouths (words).

284
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,600
[Feeling embarrassed
for no reason.]

285
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,220
I'm feeling great today.

286
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,520
[All of the couples are
feeling great today.]

287
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,320
- We should go.
- Let's go!

288
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,240
[The first mission to the safe hall.]

289
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,200
What is this?

290
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,010
- This is a competition.
- We're not a team.

291
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,940
<i>The first game of the
dangerous couple mission is</i>

292
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,180
the eggs...

293
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,550
of love.

294
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,940
<i>Yes, it's the 'Egg of love.'</i>

295
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,840
<i>The males of each team...</i>

296
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,170
<i>will hold one egg in each hand.</i>

297
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,550
<i>And you can't let it crack.</i>

298
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,550
<i>The females of each team...</i>

299
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
<i>must protect their partners</i>

300
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,450
<i>from other couples</i>

301
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,140
<i>or have to attack them
to crack their eggs.</i>

302
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,320
<i>If you crack both eggs, you win.</i>

303
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,400
<i>If both of your eggs crack,
then your team will be ousted.</i>

304
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,840
Can I take my jacket off?

305
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,110
- It's hot.
- Stop trying to start a fight.

306
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,220
- Her tone is like that.
- It's hot, it's hot.

307
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,370
She said it like
'can I take ma jacketoff?'

308
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,720
[Yoo ssi, 100% synced with Jessi.]

309
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,540
She sounds like she's from
the country and not America.

310
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,070
It was like 'can I take ma jacketoff?'

311
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,660
She can't speak very well, so be nice.

312
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,840
Jae Suk!

313
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,340
It's her tone.

314
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,870
[Don't be mistaken, everyone.]

315
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,700
She's actually very nice, everyone.

316
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,640
You sound the same.

317
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,520
While everyone is laughing,
Do Yeon is very anxious.

318
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,240
Why are you anxious?

319
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,170
I should have done that.

320
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,070
- Don't think about that!
- To form a competitive composition.

321
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,570
[Look forward to seeing Do Yeon!]

322
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,570
Everyone take two eggs.

323
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,540
- Wait.
- What?

324
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,950
If you hold it tight in your fist,
it doesn't crack, they say!

325
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,140
Right, it doesn't break.

326
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,070
- Really?
- Try one, for practice.

327
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,140
Try one as practice.

328
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,200
- Sorry.
- Wow!

329
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm really sorry.
Sorry.

330
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,220
It does crack!

331
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,900
Out of everyone, it's Jessi.

332
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm really okay.

333
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm going to take
a shower anyway!

334
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,340
I watched Running man very often.

335
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,750
This is a real competition.

336
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,230
Jae Suk, trust me.

337
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,770
That tall woman?
Keep dreaming!

338
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,820
The tall woman?
She's Do Yeon.

339
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,240
You need to grab
one of their arms first.

340
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,550
Oh my, it feels nice.

341
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,270
Jong Kook's weakness is women.

342
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,470
He might just give up an arm.

343
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,090
When they come,
just kick them.

344
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,940
Just keep kicking.
Kick as you walk.

345
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah like that.
[Choa's high kick.]

346
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,960
Don't go!
Come here!

347
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,430
They're easy.

348
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,650
If anything, we need to win
the games.

349
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,440
So what do I do to crack
someone else' egg?

350
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,140
You need to put your fingers inside.

351
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,970
<i>- Ready!
[The egg of love.]</i>

352
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,250
Stay next to me.

353
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,750
[Jessi is confident.]

354
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,370
Oh my god,
Oh my god!

355
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,520
Oh my god!

356
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,240
[Yoo Ri comes from behind.]

357
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,620
[An attack without any defense.]

358
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,130
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,770
They're fighting!

360
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,500
[They're throwing themselves!]

361
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,100
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo attack Suk Jin.]

362
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,420
Crack it!
Crack it!

363
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,570
[Gary and Ye Ji,
Ha Ha and Choa join in.]

364
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,450
[While Jong Kook and Do Yeon
are the opponents they need to attack.]

365
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,280
[Everyone's fighting except for
Jong Kook and Do Yeon.]

366
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
Yoo Ri, don't do this!

367
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,370
[Choa attacks Big Nose.]

368
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,820
She's really tough!

369
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,940
They're really tough!

370
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,700
[Running away is the
best option for survival.]

371
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,650
[Hello, Giraffe.]

372
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,620
[Giraffe doesn't realize
he's being chased.]

373
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,840
Wait!
Wait!

374
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,550
[Ye Ji breaks one of Kwang Soo's eggs.]

375
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,510
[One shot. One kill.]
- I did it!

376
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,070
I only have one left!

377
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,020
Wait!
Where's Jae Suk?

378
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,220
Ye Ji!

379
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,900
No!

380
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,530
[Being thrown out.]

381
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,070
[The brides' target, Gary.]

382
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,370
[The Piranha Brides Corporation.]

383
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,020
Don't do this!
Help me!

384
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,810
[Surrounded by five women,
charming Gary.]

385
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,340
Jessi, it hurts!

386
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,970
Jessi's beating up somebody.

387
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,930
[They're hiding and watching them.]

388
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,970
- No!
- No!

389
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,430
[Yoo Ri vs. Ye Ji.]

390
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,200
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

391
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,710
They're really tough.

392
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,420
They're so tough!

393
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,420
[I have to protect my other egg.]

394
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,180
[Egg-stremely shocked.]

395
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,270
[The sudden attack of the tall woman.]

396
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,390
[Please help me, my legs.]

397
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,820
Ye Ji!

398
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,470
[Right in front of them is Jessi.]

399
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,400
[Caught you!]

400
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,550
One of mine already cracked!

401
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,120
[The hip hop Pacquiao's
deadly punch.]

402
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,510
No!

403
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,610
This is competition!

404
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,970
[I will protect my man!]

405
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,870
[Choa joins them.]

406
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,220
Choa here, here!

407
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,990
It's here, that one cracked already.

408
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,050
[Ye Ji can't help him any more.]
- Do Yeon, Hurry up!

409
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,440
Do Yeon!

410
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,420
- Did it crack?
- Yeah.

411
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,470
<i>If both of your eggs crack,
then your team will be ousted.</i>

412
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,870
<i>- Gary and Ye Ji are ousted.
- Bye, bye!</i>

413
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,910
You did well.
I'm really sorry.

414
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,240
[Out of energy after the first game.]

415
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,200
Ye Ji...

416
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,150
I'm so tired.

417
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,150
I think I underestimated them.
Think of them as men.

418
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,120
- Hey!
- Suk Jin.

419
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,340
Suk Jin!
Suk Jin!

420
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,120
Think about this carefully.

421
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,890
Ha Ha, come.

422
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,400
If we continue like this,
Jong Kook will win.

423
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,230
- Not now!
- It's a meeting!

424
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,550
- It's a discussion.
- To be fair, let's crack one.

425
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,500
What do you mean?
Hey!

426
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,540
- Hey!
- Jong Kook...

427
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,740
It cracked!
[The hip hop Pacquiao's accuracy.]

428
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,570
- One of them cracked!
- Jessi uses her fist!

429
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,520
- It hurts!
- She doesn't understand we...

430
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,740
Jessi, you don't know what's going on?

431
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,190
- We're a team!
[Piggy back.]

432
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,220
We need to get to Jong Kook first.

433
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,970
Help me, any one!

434
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,250
No, you can't go!

435
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,170
- Do I hold on?
- Yeah.

436
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm holding her, I'm holding her.

437
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,050
[Gulp.]

438
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,640
Say ah.

439
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,050
[Spit it out!]

440
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,950
[Will he survive?!]

441
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,190
[Abrupt.]

442
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,000
[Finger attack.]

443
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,860
He lost it!

444
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,500
[The egg cracks.]

445
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,550
[Big Nose's humiliation.]

446
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,670
Okay, we got one.

447
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,340
She's a monster.

448
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,140
[You win!]

449
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,120
Jessi!

450
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,800
You, Jessi!

451
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,350
Go away, Jessi!

452
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,920
[Greatest fighter, Jessi.]

453
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,440
- Jessi's the best.
- Jessi's the best.

454
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,830
I think they're a team.

455
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,900
What are you going to do?

456
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,820
No, no.

457
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,320
Kwang Soo if you don't win,
you're dead.

458
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,750
You need to eliminate Ha Ha.

459
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,750
Go, go!

460
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,320
Jae Hyuk, go!

461
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,720
I'm not Jae Hyuk.

462
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,340
- I'm not Jae Hyuk.
- Jae Hyuk.

463
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,370
[Choa's target is Jae Suk.]

464
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,870
[Reverse.]

465
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,770
[He escapes from Choa.]

466
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,450
[Thud.]

467
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,250
[Trip, fall...]

468
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,650
[and crack!]

469
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,680
Ha Ha!

470
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,350
I tripped, and fell.

471
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,700
I'm so upset!

472
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,540
I tripped and fell!

473
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,940
I'm so upset!

474
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,490
I tripped on that.

475
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,900
[It doesn't count.]

476
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,590
I succeeded!

477
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,120
Choa, tell them please.

478
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,500
I tripped and fell.

479
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,040
I wasn't even planning on attacking.

480
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,870
But you fell, so I lightly
pinched your egg.

481
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,070
Oh, he fell and cracked it?

482
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,220
This narrows it down a lot.

483
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,750
[Three teams are left.]

484
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,440
All the strong couples are eliminated.

485
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,470
But Jong Kook is hard.

486
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,250
Let's do it again!

487
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,990
What do you mean again?

488
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,520
Yoo Ri has pale legs

489
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,620
you seem like you don't
go out that much.

490
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,800
You don't exercise much, do you?

491
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,700
- She's quiet.
- I do one!

492
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,770
I breathe.

493
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,440
But...

494
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,220
I have bits of your egg in my nail.

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,650
The yolk.

496
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,380
Your spit.

497
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,640
My spit isn't yellow.
It's from the egg.

498
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,490
Ye Ji seems to enjoy
watching today.

499
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,840
- I never got to hear your voice.
- I'm sorry Ye Ji.

500
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm Jae Suk, not Jae Hyuk.

501
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,540
She keeps calling me Jae Hyuk.

502
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,540
- Who's Jae Hyuk?
- My manager.

503
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,170
Your manager?

504
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,540
- What are you doing?
- Go Do Yeon!

505
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,540
That's good!
Keep going!

506
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,280
Ji Hyo!
Ji Hyo!

507
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
Where?

508
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
Where are you?

509
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,050
Ji Hyo, it's here!

510
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,730
[The one who wants to protect vs.
the ones who want to crack.]

511
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,920
- Ji Hyo!
[You must be in the top two]

512
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,120
[to select your wedding hall.]
- Bite him, Ji Hyo!

513
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,240
Kick behind his knees!

514
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,850
[Hip attack.]

515
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,300
Ji Hyo! End it!

516
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,920
[Time to go out.]

517
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,920
- She keeps hitting my bum!
- I'm sorry!

518
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
She's chopping my bum!

519
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,890
[Suddenly...]
- Hurry!

520
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,070
- Ji Hyo!
- Now, now.

521
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,540
High kick, high kick!

522
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,100
Would you help me out?

523
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,340
Can I borrow your hoodie?

524
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,250
Let's go together.

525
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,440
I will be back soon.

526
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,820
[Transformation into a dad.]

527
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,700
[Slowly into the war zone.]

528
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,300
[Already close behind.]

529
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,170
Kwang Soo's behind you!

530
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,100
[I'm Back!]

531
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,620
[Attacks Ha Ha.]

532
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,300
Come here, little girl.

533
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,370
[I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.]

534
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,600
Ji Hyo, we need to crack this.

535
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,670
[The tall woman's incredible power.]

536
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,280
[Choa's super kick.]

537
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,720
Ow!

538
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,400
[Thrown out.]

539
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,600
[What just...?]

540
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,850
Oh my, I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,150
I'm really, really sorry.

542
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,800
[Sorry, we couldn't protect you.]

543
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,820
I'm really sorry.
If you feel unjust, hit me.

544
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,750
No, I'm not going to hit you!

545
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,640
[Jong Kook, Do Yeon vs. Ha Ha, Choa.]

546
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,100
- What happened?
- Why is no one attacking him?

547
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,240
Choa, kick his calves!

548
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,240
[One arm, knock down.]

549
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,330
[Do Yeon, mount-position.]

550
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,250
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, we won.

551
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,200
[Game over.]

552
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,370
[Jong Kook, Do Yeon 1st place.]

553
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,110
Wow, it's no fun at all.

554
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,350
You did well.

555
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,640
Let's have round 2!

556
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,170
Round 2!

557
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,500
This store needs to operate, too.
Don't you think?

558
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,240
When she said round two, Yoo Ri said

559
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,770
'Don't you think the store
needs to operate, too?'

560
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,340
[The true meaning
behind the elegant words...]

561
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,830
She doesn't want to do round two.

562
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,140
[Jong Kook, Do Yeon 1st place.
Ha Ha, Choa 2nd place.]

563
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,810
[It's time to choose
their wedding hall.]

564
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,770
<i>Ha Ha and Choa, please come forward.</i>

565
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,410
You must be happy!

566
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,820
We need to be second place at least.

567
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,620
Put it down.

568
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,250
Let us see that!

569
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
[Check your invitation first
and choose a wedding hall.]

570
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,570
It depends on luck at this point.

571
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,840
[They're all in the A hall.]

572
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,740
They didn't spend much time changing.
I think we're all the same.

573
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,650
[They need to analyze
Jong Kook and Do Yeon's mentality.]

574
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,870
Should we stay here?

575
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,620
[Changing to B hall.]

576
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,240
<i>If the dangerous couple wins a game</i>

577
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,020
<i>they can check and change
all of the couples' destinations.</i>

578
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,370
- We should have ousted them!
- We shouldn't let them win.

579
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,370
You should have told us that
from the beginning!

580
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,550
[Bickering and blaming]

581
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,020
We'll change them all.

582
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,000
[They need to put
everyone in one location.]

583
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,940
[We will repeat 'the future' again!]

584
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,950
[The opening wedding ceremony
where everyone was ousted.]

585
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,200
[Will this future be
repeated in eight hours?]

586
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,060
[The tall woman
who threw out herself.]

587
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,970
[Open your eyes!]

588
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,900
[Gentleman tries to be quiet.]

589
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,150
[He sits quietly...]

590
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,700
[and the tall woman wakes up.]

591
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,970
Are we leaving now?

592
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,170
- You were sleeping.
- Yes.

593
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,040
Are you tired?

594
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,070
- We started filming really early.
- My, my...

595
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,920
[Will she be able to keep it up?]

596
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,470
[Six hours before
the dangerous wedding.]

597
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,470
- Boxing.
- Is it a boxing ring?

598
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,360
It's a boxing ring.

599
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,670
What is this for?

600
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,740
- It's a ring!
[Couple of trays are a bonus.]

601
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,840
We arrived early.

602
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,230
- Is it a ring?
- It's boxing?

603
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,070
Is this for a game like
'Look this way'?

604
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,840
Why are my fingers hurting?

605
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,870
You put them in Suk Jin's mouth earlier!

606
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,640
[She attacked aggressively
and she forgot already.]

607
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,920
- When she cracked the egg?
- Yes, she's really something.

608
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,770
You know what Jessica H.O is?

609
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,320
Her name is Ho Jessi.

610
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,550
- Her surname is Ho.
- Stop making fun of my name!

611
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,720
- It's her real name?
- Her name is Ho Jae?

612
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,970
- It's Ho Hyun Joo.
- Yes, Ho Yeon Joo.

613
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,450
- It's Hyun Joo!
- Ho Hyun Joo!

614
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,240
- Is there a surname 'Ho'?
- Yes.

615
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,350
There's 'Lady Ho Ho.'
(Korean title for 'Mrs. Pepperpot')

616
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,520
[What are you talking about,
Mister Ha Ha?]

617
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,240
Are there any celebrities
with that name?

618
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,020
Honaldo.
(Cristiano Ronaldo)

619
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,350
I don't know anyone.

620
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,170
Ho Dong.
(Kang Ho Dong)

621
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,000
- His surname is Kang.
- Just call me Jessi.

622
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
- So funny!
- Jessi Ho!

623
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,690
- Ye Ji's here.
- Let us hear your voice.

624
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,790
I haven't heard you talk yet!

625
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,500
I talked to her and found out...

626
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,550
- that she never dated anyone.
- Don't lie!

627
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,440
Ye Ji!

628
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,660
You fell for it?

629
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,050
How can he fall for that?

630
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,620
You know near the Han River...

631
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,320
she said she goes there at 1 a.m.
She told me that.

632
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,570
You thought she was hinting at you?

633
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,670
I thought of going
somewhere else with her.

634
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,520
He fell for it again.

635
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,320
- I can meet her there at 1 a.m.
- Stop believing it!

636
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,020
- Was I fooled again?
- Of course!

637
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,320
Compared to these people,
my partner is a gentle lamb.

638
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,940
She's so graceful.

639
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,720
You should know that
she's the best wife material.

640
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,050
But she's single now.
She's pretty and family oriented...

641
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,540
- Don't you have a boyfriend?
- No, she doesn't.

642
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,370
- They say so but...
- I'm sure she has one!

643
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,780
[She must be very sure of it.]

644
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,020
[In a firm tone...]
- I'm sure she has one!

645
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,650
Don't you have one?

646
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,140
[The outspokenness just started.]

647
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,820
Why don't you talk about me?

648
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,270
What did you talk about?

649
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,040
Before we left the last mission site...

650
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,670
she was sleeping.

651
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,330
She didn't talk a lot.

652
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,850
I pretended to sleep.
But he didn't come in.

653
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,640
What did you expect?

654
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,920
No, she was sleeping like a baby.

655
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,240
Where were you heading?

656
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,020
No, I was waiting in the car
so we can talk together.

657
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,620
I didn't want to bother her.

658
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,450
Do Yeon debuted as
Park Jung Ah's doppelganger.

659
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,050
You look like Jung Ah?

660
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,420
I insisted, but I look more like
Koo Bon Seung.

661
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,350
That's right.
She looks like Koo Bon Seung.

662
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,900
I thought she looked familiar.

663
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,520
[She even dances like him.]

664
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,740
She does look like Koo Bon Seung.

665
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,240
What is this?

666
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,200
<i>This game is 'Tell Me Something.'.</i>

667
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,520
<i>Each couple picks a sentence
that you need to hear from your partner.</i>

668
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,650
<i>You will sit inside the ring
facing each other.</i>

669
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,820
<i>Make your partner say the sentence.</i>

670
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,970
<i>The fastest couple
will be the winner.</i>

671
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,160
It's too difficult.
I'm really bad at this.

672
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,040
We play it with our partners?

673
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,120
<i>I'll announce who will go first.</i>

674
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,170
<i>The first couple will be
Jae Suk and Jessi.</i>

675
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,040
Show me, Jessi!

676
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,600
Let's finish it quickly.

677
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,250
- Jessi and... what?
- You'll play with me.

678
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,980
[She didn't understand the game.]

679
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,380
[Jessi is like me.]

680
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,840
- Only Jae Suk needs to know?
- Yes.

681
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,450
He needs to hear it from Jessi.

682
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,280
It's impossible!

683
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,000
- Okay, explain it to me.
- Just respond to what I say.

684
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,190
<i>Please sit on that chair, Jae Suk.
Jessi can sit on the other chair.</i>

685
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,600
Why do we have to start this?
I'm nervous!

686
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,970
Can I practice once?

687
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,770
We can't practice.

688
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,120
It's too difficult.
We can't be the first couple!

689
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,050
- Just do it!
- I'm ruined!

690
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,340
But his explanation...

691
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,350
for example...
[Should I take a nap?]

692
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,550
- Is it one word or a sentence?
- It's a sentence.

693
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,920
That's even harder!
We'll lose.

694
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,420
- Just do it!
- When are you going to start?

695
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,840
We won't lose.

696
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,340
<i>Yoo Jae Suk won't get hit.</i>

697
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,470
I want to explain then!

698
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,530
Would you just start playing the game?

699
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,650
Just follow what they tell us!

700
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,400
- This is a competition!
- It's too difficult for me!

701
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,910
Let's just start, Jessi.

702
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,140
Until when are we going
to do this?

703
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,050
Okay, let's start!
Get ready.

704
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,240
<i>Ready!</i>

705
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,640
[Who are you to judge me?]
- You need to learn how to rap.

706
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,500
[Disappointed.]

707
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,520
- Oh my god!
- You're not supposed to listen!

708
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,650
I don't mean it!

709
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,600
Don't be sad, talk to him!

710
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,770
You need to talk back.
Don't be upset!

711
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,240
You need to learn how to rap
from the beginning!

712
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,120
You know what I'm saying?

713
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,720
- Tell him something.
- You're ugly.

714
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,270
That's not it!

715
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,150
[You're ugly!]

716
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,550
She's driving me crazy.

717
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,240
- She just wants to say it.
- Time out!

718
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,320
Wait, she doesn't understand
the game at all.

719
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,600
[At least she know you're ugly...]
- Correct answer!

720
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,050
Viewers need to know how ugly he is.

721
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,000
I couldn't think of anything.

722
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,030
Can we do it again?

723
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,200
Try responding to what he says.

724
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,470
- Respond to what I say!
- Okay.

725
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,500
I know you're good at rap.

726
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,940
Just listen to this carefully!

727
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,850
Is it going to be different this time?

728
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,750
It's the same sentence...

729
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,350
For example, what do they mean?

730
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,250
Just do it later!
Stand up!

731
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,100
- It's is upsetting!
- They can't do that!

732
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,640
I need to see other people play.

733
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,700
- It's upsetting.
- She's so funny!

734
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,440
Jessi is driving me crazy!

735
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,770
Can we go first?

736
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,940
<i>The next couple is supposed to be
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.</i>

737
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,750
<i>Lee Kwang Soo needs to solve it.</i>

738
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,880
[What's the sentence?]

739
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,020
<i>Kwang Soo needs to say...</i>

740
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,150
[You're like an angel.]

741
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,640
I know you're a good rapper.
You should think why I said it.

742
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,020
Then what do I say?

743
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm good at it!
I'm far better than you!

744
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,160
Something like that.

745
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,070
Or you could say,
It's not even funny!

746
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,360
- Don't lie to me.
- Oh, I see!

747
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,600
You need to explain those.

748
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,650
You said 'say what I want to say.'

749
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,040
Excuse me, I think Jessi is drunk.

750
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,470
I think you're drunk.

751
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,700
- Where are you hitting me?
- There's nothing there!

752
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,220
What do you mean there's nothing?

753
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,320
Look how she talks!

754
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,870
[Let's just be nice.]
- No one knows about it.

755
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,420
I got mad for a second.

756
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,290
We don't know about it.

757
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,550
Do we need to perform a doping test?

758
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,920
Watch carefully, Jessi.

759
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,140
<i>Ready!</i>

760
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,500
You have five minutes.

761
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,300
[Let me see.]

762
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,150
Sorry for the interruption, but
is Jong Kook a gangster?

763
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,870
- He looks down on us.
- He even has a stick.

764
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,900
What's wrong with you?

765
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,170
He has a medicated patch on his knees.

766
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,200
It's not even Summer yet
but he's wearing shorts.

767
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
What are you doing?

768
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,870
And his smile...
It's really unpleasant!

769
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,990
Do you want to see me for a second?

770
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,190
What do you mean?

771
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,740
- You want to see me again?
- Seriously.

772
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,490
[You...]

773
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,350
[You little...]

774
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,700
[Attention!]

775
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,040
What are you doing?

776
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,950
You're a lot older than him.

777
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,540
You're ten years older than him!

778
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,070
The age difference is
not even a year or two!

779
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,680
You shouldn't be intimidated.

780
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,140
- You could even spank him!
- Nothing happened.

781
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,570
Don't let me catch you!

782
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,040
Isn't that too much?
Are you threatening him?

783
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,460
I won't let you catch me.

784
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,620
Then it's okay.

785
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,850
[Ji Hyo needs to hear...]
[You're like an angel.]

786
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,850
Kwang Soo, what type of person I am?

787
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,540
- A cool-headed woman.
- Give her a true answer.

788
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,250
[Actually, you are...]

789
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,940
[I've seen you for five years...]

790
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,220
A bit annoying.

791
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,800
[A bit annoying!]

792
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
[Thank you, Giraffe.
I'm only 'a bit' annoying.]

793
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,660
What was that?

794
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,600
[Culture shock!]

795
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,150
[Blank Ji expected to hear she's an angel
but it turns out that she's annoying.]

796
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,640
I guess you just say
what you're really thinking.

797
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,340
Because I don't know the answer.

798
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,320
[She tries new strategy.]
- What's your ideal type?

799
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,900
- Not too tall...
- Not too tall, and pretty...

800
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,670
I can't even say this?

801
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,540
I was just saying my ideal type!

802
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,720
Kwang Soo has been seeing
girls like that in the past.

803
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,940
- A short person.
- A short and glamorous person.

804
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,170
Do you like someone like Park Na Rae?

805
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,450
[A match made in heaven]

806
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,600
She's the shortest celebrity
after Jeon Won Joo.

807
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,040
- Na Rae is cute.
- Yes, she is.

808
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,100
Her height is about 148cm.

809
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,350
- In the sky...
- It's difficult.

810
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,040
I think I know what it is.

811
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,500
[Quick witted Jong Kook
seems to know the answer.]

812
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,520
- There are stars...
- and the moon...

813
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,250
- and the sun.
- the sun and?

814
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,040
[In the sky...
then it should be the answer.]

815
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,450
I want to have you!

816
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,570
[What is he talking about?]
- You want to have her?

817
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,200
It's all because of Jessi!

818
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,840
Everybody is turning into Jessi!

819
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,750
When you want to have a girlfriend,
we say we'll get her a star.

820
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,940
What's my family name?
I mean my real name.

821
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,550
- Chun...
- Yes!

822
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,320
Chunsa (angel) like girl...
I hope for a girl like an angel.

823
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,500
And who is that?

824
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,740
Who's that?

825
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,440
I hope you're a girl like an angel.

826
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,060
I can't do this any longer!

827
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,440
- It hurts to much!
- It sounds good!

828
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:51,750
- Yes, it sounds nice.
[Only if he didn't say 'I hope.']

829
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,640
What kind of a girl am I?

830
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,770
You're a girl like an angel.

831
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,310
<i>Correct!</i>

832
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,070
- I think it took a long time.
[It took 2 minutes and 51 seconds.]

833
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,740
- It's too difficult!
- You can do it, Jessi!

834
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,490
Jong Kook solved two in no time.

835
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,950
A little like a shaman...

836
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,840
- Where should I go?
- He's really quick.

837
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,440
I wonder how he catches things so quick.

838
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,200
<i>Jessi, do you want to do it now?</i>

839
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,740
No, I'll watch another couple.

840
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,070
<i>- Little later?
- Yes.</i>

841
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,630
<i>The next couple is...</i>

842
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,500
It's Gary and Ye Ji.

843
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,040
Now it's getting interesting.

844
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,000
We'll finally hear Ye Ji's voice.

845
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,070
[He totally fell for her.]

846
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,220
She's attractive.

847
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,620
[You're really random.]

848
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,340
Mister, please give me a lot of it.

849
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,930
You're cute.

850
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,870
How much is this much?

851
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,270
[She's trying to explain the 'really' part.]

852
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,250
You can take all of me.

853
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,740
She smiles a lot.

854
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,200
She's Gary's ideal type.

855
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,640
If a girl smiles at him
he thinks about her at night.

856
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,820
- My mom is trying to give...
- He'll be seeing six of Ye Ji's faces.

857
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,240
Is that so?

858
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,840
- Mom, please give me a lot of...
- Gary is just happy.

859
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,440
- He wants to keep looking at her.
- Do you want something?

860
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,870
- Did you see Gary?
- Don't you want to drink some coffee?

861
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,320
She has a charming voice.

862
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,670
She sounds like Park Jung Ja...

863
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,420
What is the water
and what is the sky?

864
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,240
[Park Jung Ja has a very deep voice.]

865
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,770
<i>One of them will answer
your question.</i>

866
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,650
Where is the land
and where is the sky?

867
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,240
- We were going to do something before.
- It's a kind of sexy voice.

868
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,440
You're really cute!

869
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,820
No!
Oh, it's not me.

870
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,250
This drives me crazy.

871
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,970
Give us seven minutes.
I'm not going to get it.

872
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:10,940
[They're ready to do it all night.]

873
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,940
But I understand him.

874
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,250
- 'R'ear. (for random)
- He's just enjoying it.

875
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,310
What's with the rear?

876
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,880
[Wake up!]

877
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,540
Gary doesn't care about
winning this game.

878
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,200
The first letter is from the rear.

879
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,100
And then apple...
('r' and 'a' from random)

880
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,100
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

881
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,830
Are you just trying to be cute?

882
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,540
You're supposed to play the game.

883
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,020
No, I can't do this.

884
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,220
- It's too hard.
- You said it before.

885
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,750
- Was that 'really'?
- Yes.

886
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,520
- And then?
- You're really a mess!

887
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,200
[Huh?
What just happened?]

888
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,370
Isn't it too much?

889
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,140
[The tray knows how
variety shows work.]

890
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,620
We'll manually drop the tray.

891
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,760
Until 'really' is correct, right?

892
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,620
My rear is like an apple.

893
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,370
You're really random!

894
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,570
Hit him!

895
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,420
<i>Correct answer!</i>

896
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,770
[He hit him when he got it.]

897
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,450
[I didn't know that was the answer.]

898
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,740
Kwang Soo, that's the answer!

899
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,640
That sounded pretty hard.

900
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,210
You tried to give me
the letters, right?

901
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,120
[It took 2 minutes and 34 seconds.]

902
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,970
By the way, I can tell Gary
fell in love with Ye Ji.

903
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,860
I thought he couldn't get it,
but he actually got it.

904
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,120
I didn't know she kept trying.

905
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,840
The word random is hard to explain.

906
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,940
[You're flexible like a squid.']
- I have ten legs.

907
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,340
What is she doing?

908
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,640
She can do that?

909
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,350
You're freaking awesome!

910
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,720
Freaking awesome?

911
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,680
- I have ten legs.
- You're like a rare creature.

912
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,470
- Why ten legs?
- I have ten legs.

913
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,640
- A squid!
- Right.

914
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,240
You're really...
You're flexible like a squid.

915
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,440
That's right.

916
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,520
<i>- Correct answer.
- I did it?</i>

917
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,060
[It took 1 minute and 4 seconds.]
- Isn't that too easy?

918
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,040
[That's incredible.]

919
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,360
Jong Kook and Do Yeon.

920
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,740
['Oppa, Marry me.']

921
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,040
- Are you ready?
- Yes..

922
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,240
I'm going to give all
my money to my wife.

923
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,670
- Marry me.
- Did she get it?

924
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,200
<i>- It has to be precise.
- Would you marry me?</i>

925
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,440
You need to call me first.
How would you address me?

926
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,450
Honey.

927
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,540
I said it when I met you.

928
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,740
I'm sorry but...

929
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,270
please tie his arms for me.

930
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,600
[He's too competitive.]

931
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,220
He doesn't hit women.

932
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,570
You need to address me...

933
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,000
Oppa, marry me!

934
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,120
<i>Correct!</i>

935
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,340
[It took 2 minutes and 40 seconds.]

936
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,200
- I was giving a hint...
- Look at him!

937
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,600
<i>The next couple is
Suk Jin and Yoo Ri.</i>

938
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,440
<i>Do you want to go first?</i>

939
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,140
- I'll challenge.
- Yes.

940
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,410
- What did she say?
- Do you want to go first or later?

941
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,200
- She said she'll challenge now.
- I thought she said she'll control now.

942
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,920
<i>Ready...</i>

943
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,440
It's up to you.

944
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,460
<i>set, go!</i>

945
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,440
[Who are you to judge me?]
- Jessi.

946
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,300
You're just... not.

947
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,470
- You...
- Get lost!

948
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,670
- It's not that, Jessi.
- Jessi is upset, look at her!

949
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,340
Her face turned red.

950
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,770
You're not supposed to
perform a rap.

951
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,440
You need to start from the
beginning all together!

952
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,320
Do your job properly as an MC!

953
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,940
[Do your job properly as an MC!]

954
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,040
They're just fighting!

955
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,540
Is this a diss battle?

956
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,840
- That's not it.
- Is this a freestyle rap battle?

957
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,700
[The previous teams were
not really good examples.]

958
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,940
- She's driving me crazy!
- You're doing a good job!

959
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,870
Jessi, your rap is wrong
from the first note!

960
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,140
That's not how you do it!

961
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,970
- Freestyle rap?
- He's bad at explaining.

962
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,680
I don't know what the answer is
but I think it's your fault.

963
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,540
I could guess all the answers
easily but yours.

964
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,620
[Jessi and Yoo ssi are about the same.]

965
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,120
- Unpretty Rap Star?
- No, it's not.

966
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,170
- You can't swear!
- I'm sorry.

967
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,400
- Make it easier.
- I see.

968
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,740
I think you're better at dancing!

969
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,370
- Or try singing slow songs.
- I know what it is.

970
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:49,200
- I don't think you should rap.
- Answer it in English.

971
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,140
[I can give the answer in English?]
- JYP!

972
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,570
[Why did she mention
him all of a sudden?]

973
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,450
I think we should do it later.

974
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,920
Doesn't JYP say stuff like this
on K-pop star?

975
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,940
Just come here, Jessi.

976
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm sorry.
Can you give us another chance?

977
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,440
Just once!

978
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,340
- What are you going to do?
- Please give us one more chance!

979
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,950
[Another sentence is given.]

980
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,440
- This time, Jessi will be asking.
- She can explain?

981
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,140
Come on, I'll answer it quickly.

982
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,040
[Are you crazy?]

983
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,840
You can talk.

984
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,940
Am I crazy?

985
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,090
- It hurts.
- How can I explain this?

986
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,040
- Say something.
- This was right.

987
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,470
- It was?
- Okay?

988
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,800
- Don't talk.
- I'm crazy about you.

989
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,660
I'm going to get crazy!

990
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,670
It drives me nuts!

991
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,040
This is upsetting!

992
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,040
[What did I do?]
- How do I explain it?

993
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,150
It's so easy!

994
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,240
You're driving me crazy!

995
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,550
Wow, he's really bad at this!

996
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,470
Try again, Jessi!

997
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,640
- Look at me!
- You!

998
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:12,950
Yes.

999
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,600
I'm going to wrap it up!

1000
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,820
How can you not see it?

1001
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,140
What is that?

1002
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,270
There's no other way
you can explain this.

1003
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,850
- I can't say it.
- Try explaining with words.

1004
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,550
- You're supposed to get it.
- You know it.

1005
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,740
- Hey...
- No, not that!

1006
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,050
You make me go crazy.

1007
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,220
Seriously, you...

1008
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,740
- I'm fed up with you!
- Keep going!

1009
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,840
Say that in Korean.

1010
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:55,470
- He was saying it in Korean!
- He's been speaking in Korean!

1011
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,870
Say that in English.

1012
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,840
<i>Correct!</i>

1013
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
[It took 3 minutes and 8 seconds.]

1014
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,240
You should have told me that earlier!

1015
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,540
Why is only my question in English?

1016
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,870
[We didn't think it was a big deal.]

1017
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,640
Only if you said if it's in English.

1018
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,620
We're the last ones.

1019
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,920
Speak for yourself.
You were worse than me.

1020
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,440
- What is she saying?
- Just step back, I'm embarrassed.

1021
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,940
Let's do it!

1022
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,440
Yoo Ri hasn't done this before.

1023
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,340
I've never done this, either.

1024
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,640
Look at her face!
She's pale!

1025
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,240
[You have multiple
personality disorder?]

1026
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,970
[She cries all of a sudden.]

1027
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:54,920
[Suddenly happy]

1028
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,490
I don't know what to do.

1029
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:04,220
The weather is nice today
and I like you very much.

1030
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,820
- I want to keep it touch with you.
- I'd like to go out with you.

1031
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,430
[Wake up!]

1032
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,120
He means it.

1033
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,140
It's time to answer.

1034
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,970
She's scary.

1035
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,770
[Big nose is dumbfounded by her acting.]

1036
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,040
Do you think I'm Yoo Ri?

1037
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,750
You're out of your mind!

1038
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,740
Oh, she was in that drama!

1039
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:34,100
Oppa, peace!
(A line from 'Kill me, Heal me.')

1040
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,040
- What is this?
- It's multiple...

1041
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,630
Are you multiple?

1042
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,670
- Give me your phone number!
- I can give it to you.

1043
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,440
[After a long while...]
- You're...

1044
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,670
a person with a case of
multiple personality disorder?

1045
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:00,040
- What?
- That's too long.

1046
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,120
- You almost got it.
- You...

1047
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:07,950
have a case of multiple
personality dis... disorder?

1048
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,640
- What was that?
- Why?

1049
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,470
- Wait.
- The last part is weird.

1050
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,970
- He's done.
- Kill Me, Heal Me!

1051
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:21,050
You said you watched
'Kill Me, Heal Me'!

1052
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,810
- It's not weird if you say it fast.
- He's too much!

1053
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,670
You said you saw the drama!

1054
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,340
You watched 'Kill Me, Heal Me'!

1055
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,170
You have multiple personality disorder?

1056
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,020
<i>- Correct!
[2 minutes 58 seconds passed.]</i>

1057
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,920
A case of multiple personality disorder.

1058
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,250
- That's what we usually say.
- No, we just say it like this.

1059
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,260
I'll have to win over him.

1060
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,740
<i>The second winner, please come forward.</i>

1061
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,540
Can we only see our wedding invitation?

1062
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,740
I think we can win at sports-like games.

1063
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,140
I'm still not good at Korean.

1064
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,640
<i>Yes, open it like that.</i>

1065
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,740
[Checking their own invitation.]

1066
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,440
What should we do?

1067
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,640
Should we go there?

1068
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:15,490
Jong Kook changed it
for some reason.

1069
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,840
Or should we change it?

1070
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,390
It's by luck, I guess.

1071
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,450
He smiled.

1072
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,140
Yes, change it.

1073
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,670
<i>Put it down and go back.</i>

1074
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:34,450
[Gary and Ye Ji changed
to 'A' wedding hall.]

1075
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,940
- You need to win at least twice.
- That's right.

1076
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,720
Then you can tell if
we're all in the same hall.

1077
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,150
We know what to do.
We'll open it casually.

1078
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,520
We changed to this before.

1079
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,220
[Jong Kook didn't change it?]

1080
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,640
Wait a minute.

1081
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,220
[They're surprised to see
it's still the same.]

1082
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,500
- Does it mean he didn't change it?
- No, he didn't.

1083
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,540
- It's the same as we changed it.
- Yes, it's the same.

1084
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,140
This is confusing!

1085
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,040
Why would he do that?

1086
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,370
It's really confusing!

1087
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:13,870
He wouldn't have imagined that
we would win the second game again.

1088
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,080
Maybe that's why he left...

1089
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,640
I think...

1090
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:22,940
- I think we should just stay here.
- Okay.

1091
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,990
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.

1092
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,740
We'll stay at 'B' hall.

1093
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,090
I was confused but
I think you're right.

1094
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,850
Just like you said.

1095
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:41,350
[Will their choice change...]

1096
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,100
[their miserable future?]

1097
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,100
[Three hours before
the dangerous wedding.]

1098
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,200
[A specially prepared field
surrounded by cherry blossoms.]

1099
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,240
[What is their final mission?]
- What is this?

1100
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,590
- This looks like...
- What is it?

1101
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,040
Looks like it's related to water.

1102
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,470
We need to win this.

1103
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:10,070
<i>A few teams never saw
their own invitations.</i>

1104
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,140
- We haven't seen ours.
- Us neither.

1105
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,940
Jessi got scolded by
her manager, Jae Hyuk.

1106
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,620
- I got scolded.
- She uploaded her picture on her SNS.

1107
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,150
Her agency told her
not to upload more pictures.

1108
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,740
I was next to her.

1109
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,100
And she said
'Jae Suk told me to upload it.'

1110
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,950
'Don't do it again!'
'I see!'

1111
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,000
'I see!'
'I won't do it again!'

1112
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,660
- Gae Suk...
- I'm not Gae Suk.

1113
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,800
She calls him Jae Hyuk and Gae Suk.

1114
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,600
She's unique!
You're the best!

1115
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,640
It was fun!

1116
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,440
[Someone gets nervous, every time
Jessi makes everyone laugh.]

1117
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:55,050
Do Yeon, you look tired.

1118
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,510
I'm very happy.

1119
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,120
Thank you for inviting me
on this show.

1120
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,020
Why did she get old all of a sudden?

1121
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,000
- Were you sleeping?
- I'm Do Yeon's aunt.

1122
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,770
[Do Yeon's grandmother might
come at the end of the game.]

1123
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:13,260
I hear she can impersonate Jessi.

1124
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,240
- Try acting like her.
- I heard she's good at it.

1125
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,850
- It's funny for others but...
- Don't do it!

1126
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,320
- Please, do it!
[It won't be easy to impersonate her.]

1127
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,710
I did it at a comedy show.

1128
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,540
There's a famous scene.

1129
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:34,200
Everyone's sitting here
and sharing opinions.

1130
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,240
Wait a second.
I need to talk.

1131
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,380
Wait a second.
I need to talk.

1132
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,120
[This scene is from...]

1133
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:49,120
[Not that long ago,
this made Jessi 'the legend of diss.']

1134
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,570
[She becomes Jessi herself.]

1135
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,670
[Charismatic!]

1136
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:59,320
Did I do that?

1137
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,820
During the past ten years being
a rapper, today is the worst day.

1138
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,380
[The way she talks and walks...]

1139
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,420
[and even the facial expressions
are the same.]

1140
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,050
[Very detailed]

1141
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,750
That's my habit!

1142
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,570
My lips actually cracked doing this.

1143
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,600
Who are you to judge me?

1144
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,920
[Her never ending diss!]

1145
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,400
Hey, you ugly!
Why are you frowning?

1146
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,570
[Kwang Soo becomes an ugly kid.]

1147
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,120
I'm the C.E.O.
And the rest of you are wallflowers!

1148
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,320
[She's even more like Jessi.]

1149
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,850
[It's going to the climax!]

1150
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,900
[I'm Jessica D.O.]

1151
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,970
[Birth of a legendary impersonator.]

1152
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,600
Good job!

1153
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,750
I feel so much better!

1154
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,300
Now Do Yeon can go home and sleep.

1155
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,850
You would regret if you didn't do this.

1156
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,400
Jessi, was she good?

1157
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,240
No.

1158
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,020
Only her tongue is the same as mine.

1159
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,740
- Why do you do that?
- It's just my habit.

1160
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,880
<i>This is the last game.</i>

1161
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,820
<i>The original game is from Australia.</i>

1162
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:30,550
<i>They had an idea from seeing
a drunken husbands at a bar</i>

1163
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:34,000
<i>and his wife was dragging him home.</i>

1164
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,320
<i>They made a game and
we changed it a little.</i>

1165
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:44,050
<i>Brides will drag their grooms
by holding their feet.</i>

1166
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:49,250
<i>The couple who pass the finish line
first including their head, is the winner.</i>

1167
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,370
<i>Who will win this game
can change the future.</i>

1168
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:56,800
<i>That's possible.</i>

1169
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,390
We need to join up with each other!

1170
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,940
This is a physical activity
like you wanted to do.

1171
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,870
- It's raining, though.
- Stop your nonsense.

1172
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:09,450
Just think about it in your head.

1173
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:13,500
I was worried about
cameras getting wet.

1174
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,470
Stop, Suk Jin.

1175
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,610
[The race in soapy water.]

1176
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,650
I didn't know it was you!

1177
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:27,320
- He took off his glasses.
- He's ugly, isn't he?

1178
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,100
Yes, I'm the ugly one from before.

1179
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,320
This is a competition!

1180
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,020
Don't talk to me!

1181
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,440
I don't know you.

1182
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,550
We need to win this race.
It's a competition, okay?

1183
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,500
- You're ugly!
- He's really ugly!

1184
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,700
We need to work with each other!

1185
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,640
Joining up doesn't change anything.
You need to win.

1186
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,740
Let's try and grab their feet.

1187
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,440
He doesn't move!

1188
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,620
[It's hard to stand up on the track.]

1189
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,240
Wait!

1190
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,170
It's so cold!

1191
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,470
[Bulls-eye!]

1192
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,600
[Jessi wakes him up and
makes him competitive.]

1193
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,630
<i>Ready!</i>

1194
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,400
[We need to win and
end this race here!]

1195
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:23,300
[We won't let you win!]

1196
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,340
<i>Ready!</i>

1197
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,170
[The combination of dragging...]

1198
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:35,250
[and moving is important.]

1199
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,550
<i>Don't use elbows!</i>

1200
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,270
[Three teams run fast.]

1201
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,420
[Jong Kook uses his abs.]
- One, two, three!

1202
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,250
[Jae Suk moves like he's skiing.]

1203
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,570
[Kwang Soo looks like he's upside-down.]

1204
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,900
[Every couple moves in a different way.]

1205
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,970
Jae Suk keeps using his elbows!

1206
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,510
Ye Ji!

1207
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,420
[He's so heavy.]

1208
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,820
[They moved 15cm in 5 minutes.]

1209
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,720
Ye Ji, hold them tight!

1210
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,170
Keep moving backward!

1211
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,030
[At that moment!]

1212
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,740
This is not the time for this!

1213
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:39,600
[She avoids the Tiger couple
but attacks the Giraffe couple.]

1214
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,600
What are you doing, Choa!

1215
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,820
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon keep moving.]

1216
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,720
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo move again.]

1217
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,640
[While she attacks,
her partner stays at the back.]

1218
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,220
You're too heavy!

1219
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,750
Ha Ha!

1220
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,870
Stop Jong Kook!

1221
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:10,770
[Jessi attacks the Tiger couple.]

1222
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,110
[She steals their towel.]

1223
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,750
Jessi, it's better for us to keep going!

1224
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,950
Please listen to me!

1225
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,050
[The two teams are close.]

1226
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,670
He's so heavy!

1227
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,250
[But she doesn't give up.]

1228
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:38,220
[Yoo Ri is ready to
give up on the father.]

1229
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:41,720
[They're almost at the finish line.]

1230
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,970
[The first one to pass will be
the winner of this round.]

1231
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,020
[At the same time...]

1232
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,300
[Don't let Jong Kook and Do Yeon win!]

1233
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,700
[Kwang Soo, please!]

1234
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,870
[They passed it almost same time.]

1235
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,970
[The result is...]

1236
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,990
Lee Kwang Soo wins!

1237
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,820
[Kwang Soo's head passed it first.]

1238
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:21,270
[Kwang Goo and Ji Hyo
will get to choose the hall.]

1239
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:25,770
[They stopped Jong Kook
and Do Yeon from winning.]

1240
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,970
Good job, Kwang Soo!

1241
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,920
It was so hard!

1242
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,020
As long as Jong Kook
is not the first winner!

1243
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,340
No, we can't let that couple
be the second winner.

1244
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:39,920
- What's our score?
- You said you're good at physical activities.

1245
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,090
It's slippery here.

1246
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:43,350
It's supposed to be slippery!

1247
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,500
Do well this time!

1248
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,650
And you moved like this.

1249
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,220
<i>Get ready for the second round!</i>

1250
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,670
- This won't do.
- Wait a second!

1251
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,400
Try holding here.

1252
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,210
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
have to win this race!]

1253
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,570
Stop the red team!

1254
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,720
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
are fast again.]

1255
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,650
[Jae Suk and Jessi are
right behind them.]

1256
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,750
[The rest three teams are
desperate this time.]

1257
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:22,970
[Yoo Ri is dragging her father home.]

1258
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,270
[Jae Suk and Jessi]
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon]

1259
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:30,520
No, Ye Ji!

1260
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,700
Pull harder!

1261
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,300
[The second groups chase them after.]

1262
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,650
- It's good!
- Okay!

1263
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,270
No, Ye Ji!
Not here!

1264
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,150
[Her hidden energy comes out!]

1265
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,940
[While the three teams chase...]

1266
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:00,320
[the two teams are still
leading the race.]

1267
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,150
[One of the teams will have
a chance to change the location.]

1268
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,650
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
are one step ahead.]

1269
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,300
[No!]

1270
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,150
- Jessi!
[What are you doing?]

1271
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,050
[While Jessi falls...]

1272
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,570
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon win!]

1273
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:32,300
[Jessi loses the chance
by attacking other couples again.]

1274
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,020
I can't let him win the race!

1275
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,350
I can't let him!

1276
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,120
It was very close!

1277
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:46,110
What do you mean you can't let him?
We should have won it, then.

1278
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,690
<i>Jong Kook and Do Yeon are
not the first winners.</i>

1279
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:54,600
<i>You can come forward and change
other people card first.</i>

1280
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,000
- Please hurry up changing them.
- It's either my team or Jong Kook's.

1281
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,450
Now?
Are you sure we can do it here?

1282
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,130
<i>Please move back, everyone.</i>

1283
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,550
It doesn't really matter for us.
Can't we just watch it?

1284
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,500
Let us watch it!

1285
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,800
- Watch it on TV.
- It doesn't even matter if we see it!

1286
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,540
I always watch it on TV.

1287
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,940
I think we were close to winning.
That's why.

1288
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:18,870
I'm already getting ready
for next week's race.

1289
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,100
- We're not winning this week.
- We lost already.

1290
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:27,150
- Wait, Jessi.
- It's all because of you!

1291
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:31,640
- A tall woman?
- A tall woman and a big man.

1292
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,840
- A tall woman and a muscle man.
- A tall woman.

1293
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,900
[They check that Gary and Ye Ji
changed to A hall.]

1294
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,950
- It was like this.
- Are you surprised?

1295
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,170
- We were right.
- They're changing our invitation.

1296
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,570
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo...

1297
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,040
<i>I'm sorry but please
step back, everyone.</i>

1298
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:58,040
- If I were him, I would take the risk.
- But it's risky any way.

1299
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:03,550
[Should we have to change
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo's invitation?]

1300
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:07,340
[They leave it as B hall.]

1301
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:10,830
- Hurry up!
- We don't have any choices.

1302
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,400
[It's over.]

1303
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,550
[Their future will be the same
if it stays like this.]

1304
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,810
<i>They're all done.</i>

1305
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:26,340
- Decide quickly!
- It's fifty-fifty.

1306
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:30,940
<i>You can only look at your invitation
and change it.</i>

1307
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,880
<i>Cover it well.</i>

1308
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,320
[A real battle of wits begins.]

1309
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,720
- Hurry up!
- It doesn't matter to us.

1310
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:41,160
[It's B hall...]

1311
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,140
[Then...]

1312
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,600
[How will Kwang Soo
and Ji Hyo react to this?]

1313
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,800
[They would naturally
change it to A hall...]

1314
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,150
[but what if Jong Kook
is aiming for that?]

1315
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:58,570
[Will they simply change it to A hall?
Or stay in B hall as Jong Kook planned?]

1316
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:02,300
[Their dangerous wedding
is about to start.]

1317
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,600
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
successfully gathered four couples.]

1318
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,020
[Will Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo be able to
avoid that future and win this race?]

1319
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,350
[It's finally 6 p.m.]

1320
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,000
[The dangerous wedding begins!]

1321
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,750
[The fortune of the six couples
will be revealed here.]

1322
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,470
[Jae Suk and Jessi checks
their wedding invitation.]

1323
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,670
- B hall.
- B hall?

1324
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:31,740
Let's go.

1325
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,950
- It's on the fourth floor.
- Let's go.

1326
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:38,550
- Will a miracle happen?
- It's okay.

1327
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,950
How much do you think it is?

1328
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,220
Wedding halls?

1329
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,350
I think it's expensive.

1330
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:48,520
Are you going to get married soon?

1331
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,370
Call them when you're
going to get married.

1332
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,860
[They're in front of B hall.]

1333
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:00,500
Let's go in, Jessi.

1334
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,700
[They walk into B hall.]

1335
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,140
Did we come here in the morning?

1336
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,310
It smells like food here.

1337
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:11,900
[Unfortunately, it's the same place.]

1338
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,920
It's all because of you!

1339
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,800
It's all because of me?

1340
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:21,050
[The second couple,
Suk Jin and Yoo Ri's turn.]

1341
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:24,720
It's a good thing,
if no one else is there.

1342
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,750
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
will decide the result.

1343
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,600
This is the battle between
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo...

1344
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,920
Jong Kook and Do Yeon now.

1345
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,820
- It's all over!
- Oh, no!

1346
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,570
I hoped we were the only ones here.

1347
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:46,250
It's over.

1348
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,640
If Jong Kook enters here,
that's the end.

1349
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:52,780
No, it depends what Kwang Soo
did after Jong Kook changed them.

1350
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,660
[Gary and Ye Ji enter.]

1351
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,060
[By chance?]

1352
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:08,120
[Gary and Ye Ji's location was changed
by the dangerous couple.]

1353
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,840
Why did you come here?

1354
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,500
Hope we're the only ones.

1355
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,540
[Ha Ha and Choa hope, too...]

1356
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,010
[Hello, friend!]

1357
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:22,700
Look at that.
It's over.

1358
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,340
Now, we'll see who comes next.
Kwang Soo or Jong Kook.

1359
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,640
That's the result.

1360
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,320
If Kwang Soo enters next,
we all lose to Jong Kook.

1361
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,570
Because Jong Kook planned it.

1362
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,670
[The fifth couple,
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.]

1363
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:40,650
[Their invitation is in front of them.]
We already know what it is.

1364
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,250
[Will they avoid the dangerous couple?]

1365
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:48,220
- We'll win if there's no one else.
- Yes.

1366
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,740
This makes me nervous.

1367
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:55,250
If we see other people,
then that's the end.

1368
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:58,000
If Jong Kook enters next,
it means Kwang Soo's couple wins.

1369
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,620
That's right. It means Kwang Soo's
couple chose A hall.

1370
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,520
[Hopes no one is inside...]

1371
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,420
I trust your instinct.

1372
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,570
You never choose wrong.

1373
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:15,750
You're always lucky for
this kind of stuff.

1374
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,640
If Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
come here...

1375
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:22,270
it means they lost
at the battle of wits.

1376
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,870
[Everyone will be ousted at the wedding.
Will the future be repeated?]

1377
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:34,000
[In the beginning, Jong Kook and Do Yeon
put everyone in A hall.]

1378
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,850
[After the first game...]

1379
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,800
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
put everyone in B hall.]

1380
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,400
[After the second game,
Gary and Ye Ji moved to A hall!]

1381
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,100
[And after the final game...]

1382
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,170
[Jong Kook and Do Yeon
put everyone in B hall again.]

1383
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:59,650
[But Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
were to choose after that.]

1384
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,400
[Would Ji Hyo have changed
B hall to A hall?]

1385
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,500
[This is the moment of destiny.]

1386
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,500
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo enter...]

1387
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,800
[The couples in B hall
are nervous, too.]

1388
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,730
[Someone entered!]

1389
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,970
[No one's here!]

1390
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:44,920
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
chose the empty hall!]

1391
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:50,020
[After the final game...]

1392
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,820
[Ji Hyo changed to A hall.]

1393
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,350
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo win!]
- Seriously? No one's here!

1394
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:05,540
[That means in the B hall,
Jong Kook and Do Yeon entered!]

1395
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,900
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo won!

1396
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,970
[Kwang Soo isn't here!]
- Kwang Soo won!

1397
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:14,920
- I told you!
- That's incredible.

1398
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,500
Ji Hyo's luck worked again?

1399
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,650
She's unbelievable!

1400
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,450
[The dangerous couple
came so close to victory.]

1401
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:21,620
We won!

1402
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,020
[They came to B hall to brag.]

1403
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,190
[Disappointed]

1404
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:31,970
[Forward roll ceremony for Jong Kook!]

1405
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,800
Being partnered with Ji Hyo
makes you win.

1406
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,100
- A man's life is depends on his wife!
[He holds up one million Won.]

1407
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,810
Take the money from him!

1408
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,750
You're incredible.
Why did you want to change it?

1409
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,820
I didn't think much.

1410
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,150
I just thought
I'm going to change it.

1411
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,920
[Suddenly tired]

1412
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,720
Miss Jang.

1413
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,730
Can you impersonate Jessi again?

1414
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:05,750
I'm the C.E.O.
And the rest of you are wallflowers!

1415
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,950
[Swing her firsts.]

1416
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,230
This is exactly like Jessi.

1417
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:11,400
[Icy Jessi]

1418
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,800
Can't you please tell me
that I was funny?

1419
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,270
- You were funny.
- I'm happy.

1420
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,010
Today's winners are

1421
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:25,900
Song Ji Hyo and Lee Kwang Soo!
It's time for the wedding march!

1422
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,840
I think they'll divorce
right at the door.

1423
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,120
You'll be a battered husband!

1424
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,020
They'll divorce for sure!

1425
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:39,060
I think they will divorce, too.

1426
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:44,240
[We hope Song Ji Hyo and Lee Kwang Soo
will live happily ever after!]
