1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,680
[Lee Kwang Soo]

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,040
[Kwang Soo's everything.]

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,870
[Desirable Kwang Soo.]

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,840
[Of Kwang Soo, by Kwang Soo
and for Kwang Soo!]

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,570
[But... is that all today...?]

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,190
[Six chairs for seven members?]

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,140
- There are only six seats.
- Where is the last chair?

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,250
- Gary's a celebrity today.
- Gary...

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,930
I like your clothes.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,840
[Ji Hyo, Ha Ha and Jong Kook arrive.]

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,890
I had some business
to take care of.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,660
- There are no chairs?
- There are six chairs only.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,300
Where's Kwang Soo?

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,140
Isn't this Kwang Soo's neighborhood?

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,710
<i>Today, Lee Kwang Soo
is the main character.</i>

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,910
Is Kwang Soo the main today?

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,710
<i>Kwang Soo will
get to know that shortly.</i>

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,510
Really?
Suk Jin and I came here last week.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,840
<i>Oh, you mean Kwang Soo's house?</i>

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,090
Kwang Soo told me he'd give
me a room when he moves.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,090
I've been there, but
he has no rooms to give.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,140
<i>Before we start the race</i>

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,460
<i>Kwang Soo thinks
that we're filming at 1 p.m.</i>

24
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,960
<i>Because he's the main today,
we're going to his house.</i>

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,740
What?

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,960
[Visiting Giraffe's house?]

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,210
It was two years ago...
didn't we go to Namyangjoo?

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,810
I know this place really well!

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,490
<i>We will be visiting his house,
as a surprise opening.</i>

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>As a warm-up, we have prepared
an expedition mission.</i>

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,400
[We will search Kwang Soo's house?]

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,200
[Everything about Giraffe...]

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,590
[will be revealed.]

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,710
<i>- Congratulations on the house warming!
- Nice to see you!</i>

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,950
[We will soon see this face.]

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,840
He doesn't know that it's
a housewarming party.

37
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,850
The house is too small for
the Prince of Asia.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,840
He still lives at a rental,
he used to rent a celebrity's house.

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,440
But the landlord sold the house.

40
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,210
He used to pay the monthly rent
at Hyung Jun's house.

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,410
- You cruel people.
[They prepared housewarming gifts.]

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,920
- Let's go.
- Should we go?

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,640
[Going to Kwang Soo's
house in a good mood.]

44
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,690
- Is he awake?
- He should be awake.

45
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,140
Kwang Soo's probably feeling good
about the delayed filming schedule.

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,240
- Kwang Soo?
- This neighborhood is really nice.

47
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,540
- Kwang Soo's car.
- Seo Jun lives nearby too.

48
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,360
This is your first time here, right?

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,060
- Yeah, it's their first.
- Except Jae Suk and I.

50
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,910
- Did you get everything?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
Was it five days ago?

52
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,360
- He lives in a nice apartment.
- Yes, he does.

53
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,040
He lives in a nice place.

54
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,890
He must have made a lot of money.

55
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,410
Kwang Soo doesn't tell us,
but he seems to have made a lot.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,410
It turns out that he's rich.

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,720
My agency should have
made a contract with Kwang Soo.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,920
The elevator is a little slow.

59
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,800
- Yes, it's slow.
- There's a con.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,600
Now, let's be quiet.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,100
[Arrival at Kwang Soo's floor.]

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,590
[The infiltration operation begins.]
- He lives really high up.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,520
- You don't know his password?
- I forgot.

64
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,390
[Hesitate.]

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,910
- Should I call his manager and ask?
- Jae Suk, just open the door.

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,610
Do you have cutting pliers?

67
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,890
[It looks like as if they're
going to arrest a criminal.]

68
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,040
- What if he is with his girlfriend?
- Then that's a jackpot!

69
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,990
Then we'll put mosaic effects on her.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,660
We can just introduce
her as his wife, casually.

71
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,410
If it's a celebrity, that's
even more of a jackpot!

72
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,410
Film his shoe rack first.

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,090
Her shoes will be at the entrance, right?
We can cut it out later.

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Just press the door bell.

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,790
- Is he sleeping?
- Still?

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,790
Is he not at home?

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,790
[Anxious.]

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,750
- Is he not home?
-It's possible.

79
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,440
- He's coming!
- Kwang Soo, its me.

80
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,000
- The camera is visible.
- Kwang Soo!

81
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,920
[Hello.]

82
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,940
[The surprise attack
at Giraffe's house, start!]

83
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,120
[A broadcast like
a bolt out of the blue.]

84
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,520
[Shocked.]

85
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,840
[At 11:26 a.m., the big
reveal of Kwang Soo's house.]

86
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,810
[The VJ's will enter too.]

87
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,390
Congratulations!

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,640
Wow, it's so clean!

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,950
[The invasion of the cameras.]

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,190
[Giraffe's house has been
invaded by foreign powers.]

91
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,910
[I'm a little confused...]

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,820
Kwang Soo turned the shower on.

93
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,710
- Kwang Soo!
[Is this going on broadcast?]

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,660
Why are there so many
toothbrushes?

95
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,990
Wow, it's so nice!

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,140
- The view is great!
[A luxurious view of Han River.]

97
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,960
- Yeah! Over here!
[Gary enters the bedroom first.]

98
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,670
Is this your bed?

99
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,870
Kwang Soo!
Do you sleep here?

100
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,370
His house is so nice.

101
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,500
[This is Giraffe's house.]

102
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,290
[Giraffe's day begins and ends here.]

103
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,620
- Kwang Soo, do you sleep here?
- Kwang Soo.

104
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,540
What the heck is going on?

105
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,340
- Kwang Soo, what's your address?
- Kwang Soo.

106
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,110
- Hello, address?
- Tell him the address so we can order.

107
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,670
- What?
- The address.

108
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,560
One sweet and sour pork,
three black bean noodle...

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,210
We can eat out!

110
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,590
- two fried rice, and
two seafood noodles.

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,340
And dumplings on the house!

112
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,490
Kwang Soo, you must be confused.

113
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
You should finish brushing your teeth.

114
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,440
[Big Nose's report on the smaller room.]
- He collects a lot of figures.

115
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,110
Wow.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,660
- Wow, it's nice.
- What?

117
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,990
If you look closely,
you can find Jae Suk.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,610
- Get out!
- Wait a second.

119
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,510
- I need to find something!
- What are you looking for?

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,290
What are you looking for?

121
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,540
- What?
- What are you looking for?

122
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,260
- Are you looking for porn?
- What do you mean, porn?

123
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,310
- What are you doing then?
- Why would I be looking for porn?

124
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,440
- The house is so nice, it's cute.
- Kwang Soo, hurry and get ready.

125
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,910
What is this?

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,440
What are you doing?

127
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,140
I'm not doing anything.

128
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm going to call the police!

129
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,410
[Blank Ji is crawling
around to find a jackpot.]

130
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,910
Where do you hang your laundry?

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,760
[Why?]

132
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,310
- That's not the leopard boxers.
- What are you doing?

133
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,110
- Kwang Soo, do you have arm warmers?
- Kwang Soo, where's your leopard print?

134
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,610
You have it, right?

135
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,390
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- He wears the leopard boxers a lot.

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,650
Everyone get out!

137
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,690
Why are you doing this?

138
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,660
You said filming was at one!

139
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,460
- Why are you doing this?
- You need to be calm.

140
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,640
- The house is so nice.
- No!

141
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,550
Kwang Soo, finish getting ready.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,870
Where does your girlfriend
mostly stay when she's over?

143
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,640
Wait, let me brush my teeth!

144
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,310
Sit down!

145
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440
Where are your leopard print boxers?

146
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,220
Where are your leopard boxers?

147
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,660
[Why are you looking for my leopard
print boxers at a housewarming?]

148
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,910
<i>- Today's main is Lee Kwang Soo.
- Really?</i>

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,960
<i>So to warm up, we've prepared
an expedition mission.</i>

150
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:49,560
<i>Find six items in Kwang Soo's
house.</i>

151
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,210
<i>You will succeed if you find
four out of six items.</i>

152
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,860
[1. A hair strand of 20 cm, 2.
Leopard print boxers]

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,140
[3. Food over the expiration date,
4. A computer folder with a bird name]

154
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,140
[5. A letter from a fan,
6. A non-family member female photograph.]

155
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,790
Finding a hair strand of 20 cm.

156
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,390
Finding a folder with
a bird name on the computer?

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,590
It's someone's personal preference.

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,040
If you don't name a new folder

159
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,050
it automatically names
it as a bird name. (with Alzip)

160
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,370
How do you know that?

161
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,590
[I can't tell you that.]

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,910
You must have a pheasant
on your computer.

163
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,340
[His love for birds.]

164
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,570
Is that a strand of hair?

165
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,600
[Did she catch a big fish?]

166
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,410
Is it Kwang Soo's?

167
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,540
I think I've seen his
leopard-printed ones.

168
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,540
Me too...

169
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,710
- I think I've seen them.
- I definitely saw them.

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,440
I swear he has them.

171
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,040
[Kkuk checks the fridge first.]

172
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,650
[His fridge is messy.]

173
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,340
This dressing has a
long expiration date.

174
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,790
- I can't find a hair...
[He's checking the expiration dates.]

175
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
that's long enough.

176
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,050
- Which one are you talking about?

177
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,170
- Here's a girl's dress!
- Where?

178
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,140
That's what Kwang Soo
wears all the time.

179
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,690
- It's locked with a password.
[Big-nose is on the computer.]

180
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,690
I've unlocked it!

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,610
<i>You have a time limit though.</i>

182
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,390
<i>As soon as you get inside</i>

183
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,220
<i>order some food for delivery and
do the mission before the food comes.</i>

184
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,660
[Ha Ha ordered food
delivery for the mission.]

185
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,950
[That's how they started
the exploration.]

186
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,210
[Kwang Soo, finally
finishes brushing teeth.]

187
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,210
- What is this?
- I can't find a girl's picture, either.

188
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,210
[What is this for?]

189
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,390
It's hard to find anything
in a new house.

190
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
What are you doing?

191
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,360
It's difficult to find
anything in a new house.

192
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,060
Why are you doing this to me?

193
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,960
Get out, you too!
What are you doing?

194
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,090
- What are you filming?
[He's ordering the VJ to get out, too.]

195
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,090
Where are his letters from fans?

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,610
Kwang Soo!

197
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,920
You scared me!
What's wrong with you?

198
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,910
Where is the boxer?

199
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,560
- What boxer?
- The one with the leopard print.

200
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,070
[He's checking the one he's wearing.]

201
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,610
You're taking herbal tonics?

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,310
You have a lot of soju in the fridge.

203
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,760
What's the combination with
alcohol and healthy tonics?

204
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,660
You have more soju than me!

205
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,610
Wow, he's just saying it
because it's not his.

206
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,670
Is there a letter from a fan?

207
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,660
- I'm still searching for them.
- He's should many letters.

208
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,320
Long hairs should be in the kitchen.

209
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,350
By the end of 2012. June. 28.

210
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,020
[Big-nose is sitting on the computer.]

211
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,340
[Looking for a folder
with a bird's name.]

212
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,860
[Recent]

213
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,760
[Privacy protection]

214
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,240
There's a folder named 'Chicken.'

215
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,520
[He found a bird's name!]

216
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,090
Can you find me a hair
that's 20 cm long?

217
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,990
Why would I have a hair that long?

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,790
- Don't take it personally, I just need one.
- My hair's not that long.

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,260
So... you don't have any?

220
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,610
Should I search the bathroom?

221
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,940
Here it is.

222
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,540
[The writer is humiliated
in front of everyone.]

223
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,940
What's everyone doing?

224
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,540
[My house has turned
into a game site...]

225
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,340
I came here last week and
had chicken and noodles.

226
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,910
Should we eat that?

227
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,510
This is the letter from a fan.

228
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,760
It's a storybook that
a fan of Kwang Soo made for him.

229
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,360
- This book is for Kwang Soo.
- Yes, it is a kind of a fan letter.

230
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,910
- That's right.
- Look at the photo.

231
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,560
Was your mouth caught
by a fishing hook?

232
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,370
[His lip on the left side
seems like it.]

233
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,200
[They're trying to find a long
hair in the walk-in closet.]

234
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,170
[What is Blank Ji doing?]

235
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,310
[They're going to use
Ji Hyo's hair for the mission.]

236
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,910
Give me a hair that's 20 cm long.

237
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,290
Excuse me, what is this?

238
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,110
This is long!

239
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,040
[The hair strands that
Ji Hyo scattered around.]

240
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,590
- I found one, too!
- That's Ji Hyo's hair!

241
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,390
These two are different colors.

242
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,410
[Check the length first.]

243
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,040
[They look long enough.]

244
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,770
How many girls visit this place?

245
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,990
One is black and the other is brown.

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,360
<i>You've succeeded your mission.</i>

247
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,460
[They've finished the exploration.]

248
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,340
[Buzzer beater! The food came
at the moment of success!]

249
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,580
Let me pay, where is my wallet?

250
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,090
Why don't you pay for the food?
It's your housewarming party!

251
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,610
- Who said it's today?
- It's hot, can you turn on the AC?

252
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,490
Who turns on the AC for this weather?
I've turned off the heater.

253
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,840
- You turned on the heater?
- Just to use hot water!

254
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,960
[Anger meter is going up.]
- Why are you mad?

255
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,760
Kwang Soo is upset.

256
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,310
[I could really hit them now.]
- I understand you, Kwang Soo.

257
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
What are you trying to do?

258
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,540
Wait, Kwang Soo.
I'm on your side.

259
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,110
You're on my side?

260
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,950
[He's upset.]

261
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,090
Kwang Soo...

262
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,270
if you want to delete a file, you
need to empty the recycling bin.

263
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,960
I found a few files.

264
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,940
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,760
Kwang Soo was a man!

266
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,250
He was a man, too!
I didn't know that.

267
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,220
[The exploration of Kwang Soo's
house was successful.]

268
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,910
[The meal arrived.]

269
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
He's here.

270
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll show you magic.

271
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,010
[It transforms from a coffee
table to a dining table.]

272
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,810
Kwang Soo, let me treat you a meal.
You haven't eaten yet, right?

273
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,610
[Are you pacifying me
after what you did?]

274
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,610
We're here to take care of you
and feed you.

275
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,270
[Do you know how much we
care for you?]

276
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,800
[Kwang Soo wears
his microphone now.]

277
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,640
It's good.

278
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,210
Look, what I just did.

279
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,150
I tried to grab this onion
without unwrapping it.

280
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,570
I guess you're enjoying it so much.

281
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,160
I tried to pick up a slice of onion
without unwrapping.

282
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,610
Please come when I want you to.

283
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,860
[He won't be able to open his
door to anyone easily.]

284
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,790
Suk Jin and I came to visit you because
we were worried you'd be lonely.

285
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,040
We've waited for about
two hours here.

286
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,710
Why would you wait for two hours
inside when I'm not here?

287
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
Don't come out,
if you have nowhere to go!

288
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,110
No, we had a schedule
but it was canceled.

289
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,940
[He looks pitiful.]

290
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,360
<i>I know you're eating, but
please listen.</i>

291
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,670
<i>We've started with an unusual mission.
Were you surprised, Kwang Soo?</i>

292
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,440
[What kind of a question is that?]

293
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,210
<i>The reason that we came to
Kwang Soo's house is...</i>

294
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,970
<i>because Kwang Soo is the main
character for this race.</i>

295
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,290
[Today's main character, Kwang Soo.]
- That's why we're here!

296
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,290
[He looks a bit happy.]
- Let me listen to what is it.

297
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,410
<i>Today's race is
'Desirable Lee Kwang Soo.'</i>

298
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>Lee Kwang Soo has the critical
role in winning this race.</i>

299
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,890
- You must be happy.
- That's why we came here.

300
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,160
Can we win when
Kwang Soo plays it well?

301
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,960
<i>Kwang Soo is the King Maker
for winning the race.</i>

302
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,310
<i>In the end, someone who wins
Kwang Soo will win the race.</i>

303
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,510
- Kwang Soo is going to be popular today.
- He looks happy.

304
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,320
[I feel much better now.]

305
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,160
Kwang Soo, you're our...

306
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,190
<i>You can win a hint by
winning the interim mission.</i>

307
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,640
<i>The rest of the members
need to earn Kwang Soo's heart.</i>

308
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,610
<i>In the end, only the one who stays
with Kwang Soo will win this race.</i>

309
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,360
It'll be hectic to earn
Kwang Soo's heart.

310
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,090
I remember what you did at my house.

311
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,120
- I didn't really do anything.
- Who found the long hair?

312
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,110
- It was Gary.
- No, It wasn't.

313
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,860
- It's Jae Suk.
- No, It's Ha Ha.

314
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,010
You'll see when it's on TV,
I disapproved the idea.

315
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,560
- Didn't you ring the doorbell?
- That's right.

316
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,760
He asked your manager
to get the pin number.

317
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,490
He cursed when he knew
the pin changed.

318
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,040
[I'm watching you...]

319
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,910
He was the happiest
to hear about this game.

320
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,250
[That's how Kwang Soo
acquired absolute power...]

321
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,210
[30 minutes have passed
for Kwang Soo's makeup.]

322
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,110
You've arrived, Kwang Soo.

323
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,460
Kwang Soo!

324
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,420
Get out of your car.

325
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,410
The main character is here.

326
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,070
You're still inside your car?

327
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,060
I cooled the air for you.

328
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,310
- I did it on purpose.
- You have to get out and greet him first.

329
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,740
He's not going to go with you!

330
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,690
- Pick one person who'll go with you.
- Just one person?

331
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,490
You know I drive safe!

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,710
- I had no accident for 20 years.
- I don't drive over 80 Km/h.

333
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,010
You know I'm a good driver.

334
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm at your beck and call today.

335
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,110
- You dropped honorifics in your speech?
- Please.

336
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,940
I think Gary is disqualified.

337
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,440
You're disqualified, Gary.

338
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,290
That's fine by me!
I've been frustrated by you!

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,510
You won when you played
the game with me.

340
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,940
- That's right.
- She has a lack of sleep.

341
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,690
It'll be really boring
if you go with her.

342
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,370
Song Ji Hyo fails!

343
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,140
- Ji Suk Jin fails!
- Why?

344
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,690
Just because!

345
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,440
You're lucky that I didn't hit you!

346
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,310
[Big-nose revealed
Kwang Soo's masculinity.]

347
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,540
I cleaned the table
when we were done eating.

348
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,590
- Don't forget that.
- I'll chose one of you.

349
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,090
What's on your neck?

350
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,790
Are you tired?
Do you have a stiff neck?

351
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,540
Try rotating your neck.
Fail!

352
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,540
That's dangerous!

353
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,410
How dare you trying to guard
Kwang Soo in that condition!

354
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,190
You still can't fight against him.

355
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,490
I'll raise the hand of
the person who I'll go with.

356
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,410
- You know I'll listen to you.
- The one I will go with...

357
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,710
He'll bother you if you
choose him.

358
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,860
Ha Dong Hoon!

359
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,460
- Get out of here!
- See?

360
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,690
- I was just kidding.
- You know this is just the beginning!

361
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,810
I'll see you later, Sir!

362
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,860
- Look how imprudent he is!
- Kwang Soo, stop being arrogant!

363
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,700
Ha Ha is a flatterer
in Infinity Challenge, too.

364
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,090
Seriously, this is not
Girl's Generation.

365
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,210
It's Lee Kwang Soo's generation!

366
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,190
- This is Kwang Soo's generation!
- Don't say that!

367
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,090
<i>Soo, Soo, Soo, Soo,
Kwang Soo's generation.</i>

368
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,560
Lee Kwang Soo,
I'll serve you well today!

369
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,740
- Let's go!
- Please drive safe.

370
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,060
That's a must.
And look at the weather!

371
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,840
We've never won a game
when we were paired for five years.

372
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,190
Who made Running Man?

373
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,690
It's us, the victims!

374
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,640
Actually, that's right.

375
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,390
- Until Running Man became popular.
- Whose name tags were ripped?

376
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,890
Who took the role of the weak party?

377
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,160
With the sacrifice of Lee Kwang Soo,
Running Man rose!

378
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,060
At the very person next to you,
I was there, too!

379
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,950
- Ha Ha is very bright today.
- Not at all.

380
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,740
You're very talented!

381
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,610
[A fantastic combination of
the complaisant and the flatterer.]

382
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,540
Listen Producer,
make sure you use a CG for it!

383
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,260
- It's so bright!
[I'll follow your order...]

384
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,370
[Today is happy Kwang Soo day.
We'll do whatever he wants.]

385
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,840
[The rest of the members who
were abandoned by Kwang Soo...]

386
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,060
The weather is really nice.

387
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,960
A palm reader told me he's never
read anyone like me before.

388
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,540
- Is it that bad?
- No.

389
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,410
- It's good?
- He said it's really good.

390
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,460
- Do you have a straight line?
- That's right.

391
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,910
Is the 'straight' from
you're in dire 'straits'?

392
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,710
At least with Running Man.

393
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,710
Can any of you sum up the
race for me?

394
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,890
- Just forget what happened.
- In short...

395
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,290
make Kwang Soo the winner.

396
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,240
[What did you just say?]

397
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,840
Make him the winner.
He will be with one person at the end.

398
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,090
We should make Kwang Soo
betray the person.

399
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:07,250
I think it's easy for him
to betray Jae Suk.

400
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,720
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is
the main character for today.</i>

401
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,930
<i>Is he the main character again?</i>

402
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:23,160
<i>Today's race is
'Hidden camera for Lee Kwang Soo'</i>

403
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,240
['Hidden camera for Lee Kwang Soo'?]

404
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,920
[This real mission is to
deceive Kwang Soo.]

405
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,810
Why do you like me so much?

406
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,490
I don't know where to choose from.
You're just you!

407
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,490
[Are you enjoying this, Kwang Soo?]

408
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,940
<i>Until the filming is over
and he goes home...</i>

409
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,640
<i>This hidden camera
shouldn't be discovered.</i>

410
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,970
<i>Make Lee Kwang Soo believe
that he wins alone.</i>

411
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,490
<i>If you fail at the interim mission,
he'll get a hint about the hidden camera.</i>

412
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,720
<i>Make sure that you succeed
at the interim missions.</i>

413
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,790
<i>You're the main character.
(For the hidden camera)</i>

414
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,740
<i>Main role!</i>

415
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,750
[Hope we can trick you well.]

416
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,910
<i>You're holding the key to winning.
(Hidden camera)</i>

417
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,640
<i>We can win when Kwang Soo
plays the game well?</i>

418
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,240
[We'll survive only if you're deceived.]

419
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,740
<i>When the filming is done,
and Kwang Soo gets home</i>

420
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,210
<i>you'll share the prize money,
and that's the end of this race.</i>

421
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,510
<i>Kwang Soo will figure it out
by watching TV?</i>

422
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,270
<i>Six million Won will be
given to Kwang Soo</i>

423
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,680
<i>if he becomes aware of
the hidden camera.</i>

424
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,710
<i>Six million Won?</i>

425
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,340
<i>If you successfully finish this race,
each of you will get one million Won.</i>

426
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,920
<i>Do you understand the rules?</i>

427
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,790
<i>Kwang Soo has the key
to winning?</i>

428
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,150
<i>But only Kwang Soo doesn't know</i>

429
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,320
<i>that this is the hidden camera.</i>

430
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,700
[What will be the result of this race?]

431
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,150
[The first mission site,
SBS in Mokdong.]

432
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,740
- Kwang Soo!
- Did you serve him well?

433
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,310
- Yes.
- Let's go, Kwang Soo!

434
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,540
[Kwang Soo doesn't open
the door by himself.]

435
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,960
[Ha Ha is doing his best
at serving Kwang Soo.]

436
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,590
Ha Ha is the best flatterer.

437
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,560
He's really good at that.

438
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,160
I wonder what we'll do here.

439
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,640
<i>The first mission of
'Desirable Kwang Soo' is</i>

440
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,910
<i>'Find the guest.'</i>

441
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,590
We have a guest?

442
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,510
[They have a guest?]

443
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,960
There will be lots of
celebrities in this building.

<i>On the screen behind Ji Hyo,
you see '30.'</i>

<i>Between three minutes to zero</i>

<i>bring the guest and
stand on the 'R' mark.</i>

447
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,010
<i>The person who makes
a heart with the guest wins.</i>

448
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,820
<i>From now on, find the guest.</i>

449
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,220
- Where is the guest?
- You're not giving us any hints?

450
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,820
- Is it a male or female?
- You're not telling us?

451
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,220
- How are we supposed to tell?
- How can I find the guest in 30 minutes?

452
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,790
[Who will be the guest?]

453
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,640
- What floor do we have to search?
- You're not giving us a hint?

454
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,720
- That's what I'm saying.
- What to do?

455
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,910
[As soon as the mission starts,
Kwang Soo is heading to a corner.]

456

- Hello.
- Where are you?

478
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm at the coffee shop.

479
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,990
Coffee shop?

The coffee shop on the first floor?
On the first floor?

481
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,240
On the first floor, there's
a coffee shop by the entrance

482
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,240
Why did you choose such
an easy spot?

483
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,300
I'll be there.

484
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,790
I can only see my back,
so it won't be that easy.

485
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,100
Oh, okay.

486
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,100
<i>You'll participate in the mission.</i>

- We need to find him before Kwang Soo.
- That's right.

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,240
But I feel Kwang Soo will find him first.
Because he can call his dad.

[He can call his dad?]
[Huh? His dad?]

496

Where will he be?

500
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,640
I need to watch what I say.

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,080
<i>The first mission is
'Find the guest.'</i>

505
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,210
<i>Your mission is to
pretend to find the secret guest.</i>

506
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,250
<i>But you actually need to act
in a certain way for the guest.</i>

507
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,620
<i>Each of you should act differently.</i>

508
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,310
<i>You have to win this to prevent
Kwang Soo from getting the hint.</i>

509
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,930
<i>Yoo Jae Suk needs to give the guest
a hug for three seconds.</i>

510
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,990
<i>Ji Suk Jin needs to take
a selfie with the guest.</i>

511
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,990
He likes to post his pictures.

512
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,590
<i>Jong Kook needs to give
the guest a shoulder massage.</i>

513
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,730
He always does it anyway.

514
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,300
<i>Gary needs to buy a drink
and give it to him with a straw.</i>

515
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,010
<i>Ha Ha needs to exchange winks.</i>

516
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,900
They're the things we normally do.

517
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,990
<i>Ji Hyo needs to dust off
the guest's shoulders.</i>

518
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,730
That's easy.

519
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,270
<i>I'll announce the surprise guest.</i>

520
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,870
<i>The guest is
Lee Kwang Soo's father.</i>

521
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,930
I should make him
drink out of a straw?

522
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,910
With his father...

523
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,900
<i>There are precautions.</i>

524
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,200
<i>It's a hidden camera.</i>

525
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,070
<i>Kwang Soo knows
the guest is his father.</i>

526
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,650
<i>He even knows he will get a hint
when he wins the mission.</i>

527
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,140
[They have to be extra-careful
not to get caught.]

528
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,880
I should start the camera now.

529
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,790
We can do the mission while
we're bickering with Kwang Soo.

530
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,240
Gary has the most difficult mission.

531
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,470
We can pretend to steal his father...

532
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,610
and act it out.

533
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,410
You can give him a hug like that.

534
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,560
- Mine is the easiest.
- Gary's mission is the problem.

535
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,840
I should buy a drink first.

536
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,300
[The battle of wits between 2 vs. 6]

537
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,200
[Who will win this battle?]

538
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,310
[Kwang Soo goes to the coffee shop.]

539
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,240
[There are many people
walking in the lobby.]

540
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,650
[Where is my father?]

541
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,080
Hello.

542
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,670
[Kwang Soo successfully
contacts his father.]

543
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,840
What am I supposed to do?

544
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,620
Just stay here, I'll be back.

545
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,510
- It's started already.
- Already?

546
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,840
Should I keep wearing the wristband?

547
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,680
- Yes, yes.
- I shouldn't show it to anyone?

548
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,270
This is perfect.
I didn't know it was you.

549
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,360
You look really casual.

550
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,000
[What a brilliant plan
of Kwang Soo's father!]

551
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,010
[15 minutes left!]

552
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,680
In 15 minutes, we can walk
to the middle of the lobby.

553
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,670
To the middle of the lobby?

554
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
- With me.
- With you?

555
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,870
I see.

556
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,910
- We were filming earlier at my house.
- At your house?

557
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,040
They found a girl's hair...

558
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,560
And?

559
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,790
It was mother's hair.

560
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,410
I don't know how they'll
show it on TV...

561
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,360
Tell them your mom and
sister visit you.

562
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:53,100
At your age, what
misunderstanding will it draw?

563
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,600
That's not a problem.

564
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,970
Why am I explaining it to my dad?

565
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,000
[Hopefully, time flies.]

566
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,620
[At that moment...]

567
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,880
[Ji Hyo has found Kwang Soo.]

568
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
[Why is he sitting there quietly?]

569
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,850
[Big-nose is searching the lobby.]

570
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,620
[It's Big-nosed brother!]

571
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:39,560
- Did you find the guest?
- No, I have no idea who would it be.

572
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,850
Excuse me, can I have a
glass of water?

573
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,790
- Thank you.
- Here's water.

574
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,870
We have 14 minutes left.
We'll fail at it.

575
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,500
- How can we find the guest?
- I've seen someone.

576
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,680
Who did you see?
Did you find the guest?

577
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,670
I'm not sure.

578
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,870
Did you perhaps find
the guest and hide them near here?

579
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,590
[He has a good hunch today.]

580
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,280
Do you want to go check with me?

581
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,930
- I've seen someone.
- Let's go check.

582
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,310
Let's go.

583
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,570
Kwang Soo was here.
That means he's around here.

584
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,900
He was circling around
the coffee shop.

585
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,040
Let's go from the opposite direction.

586
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,640
Yes, that's good.

587
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,620
- He will be near the coffee shop.
- Of course.

588
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,740
[Kwang Soo leads Big-nose
to the second floor.]

589
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,050
[But he keeps checking the coffee shop.]

590
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,990
- What?
- Why is Gary there?

591
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,640
What?
Kwang Soo!

592
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,130
Your mission is easier than mine.

593
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,740
[Kwang Soo saw them.]

594
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,670
[Why are they at the coffee shop?]

595
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,360
Where are you going?

596
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,990
What's wrong with you?

597
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,510
[Gary and Ha Ha
enter the coffee shop.]

598
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,110
Don't make it obvious.
Pretend we're searching.

599
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,960
Gary!
Gary!

600
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,470
[They fail at finding his father.]
- I think he's around here.

601
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,110
- Hurry up, Gary.
- Why?

602
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,070
Where do you want me to go?

603
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,440
Third floor.
Where did Gary go?

604
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,870
I don't think we should go
one by one.

605
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,670
[What am I saying?]

606
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,270
It's suspicious.
There should be something.

607
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,130
Wait!
Gather together!

608
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,880
[Emergency!]
- I see someone.

609
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,210
- I'm in a bad mood.
- Kwang Soo is not in a good mood.

610
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,670
Gather together.

611
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,400
[In an emergency,
he quickly wears his glasses.]

612
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,990
Jong Kook!

613
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,830
Earlier, I was checking...

614
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,280
[They're right behind him.]

615
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,900
Ugh!

616
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,570
What's wrong?

617
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,280
What's wrong with you?

618
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,420
It's probably nothing, right?

619
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,010
[Kwang Soo, it's too obvious.]

620
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,040
[On the contrary, his dad
is still very casual.]

621
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,270
He looks like him...

622
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,560
[They're not sure.]

623
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,240
- Where are you hurt?
- Can you stop the timer for Kwang Soo?

624
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,930
- What's wrong, Kwang Soo.
[All the members go back to his dad.]

625
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,640
[Oh, no!]

626
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,280
Kwang Soo is hurt.

627
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,970
- Wait a minute, what's going on?
- He's hurt... huh?

628
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,500
[Oh my god...]

629
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,510
[It's ruined.]
- I thought it was you.

630
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,840
I saw some cameras,
so I looked at him.

631
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,190
- He looks like Kwang Soo's dad.
[He's still acting casually.]

632
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,850
Aren't you Kwang Soo's father?

633
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,130
[They have found Kwang Soo's dad!]

634
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,410
- Aren't you Kwang Soo's father?
- This is driving me crazy.

635
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,070
- Kwang Soo's father!
- I need to take care of my puppy.

636
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,780
- He's Kwang Soo's father!
- What?

637
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,570
[I'm sorry, Son.
I can't ignore them any longer.]

638
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,570
- How have you been?
- I'm good.

639
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,810
You're Kwang Soo's father, right?

640
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,530
[I need to stop them.]

641
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,770
[Kwang Soo,
I must have been discovered.]

642
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,760
How are you?

643
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,270
- Your father is here.
[Kwang Soo pretends he didn't know.]

644
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,470
He must be the guest.
We even went to Kwang Soo's house.

645
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,670
[They have met the guest.]

646
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,420
<i>Your mission is to act
in a certain way for the guest.</i>

647
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,680
<i>Ji Suk Jin needs to take
a selfie with the guest.</i>

648
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,670
<i>Ha Ha needs to exchange winks.</i>

649
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,070
<i>Ji Hyo needs to dust off
the guest's shoulders.</i>

650
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,450
<i>Jong Kook needs to give
the guest a shoulder massage.</i>

651
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,440
<i>Gary needs to buy a drink
and give it to him with a straw.</i>

652
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,080
<i>Jae Suk needs to
give the guest a hug.</i>

653
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,170
Maybe he's the guest.

654
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,210
[Jong Kook succeeds at his mission.]
- I'm here to support a drama.

655
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,330
We're donating some furniture
for a drama.

656
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,610
- So you're not here for Kwang Soo?
- I can see him at home.

657
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,710
He doesn't have any drinks.
Why don't you give him one?

658
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,270
[Kkuk's nice assistance!]

659
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,850
[Gary succeeds at his mission.]
- Would you like some coffee instead?

660
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,340
We don't have much time
left for the mission.

661
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,310
- That's right.
[Wait on an opportunity.]

662
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,400
There's something on your shoulder.

663
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,530
[Ji Hyo succeeds at her mission.]

664
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,870
[Jae Suk succeeds.]

665
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,590
How have you been?

666
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,870
[They can't discover he's the guest.]

667
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,160
- We'll come back later.
- Don't worry about me.

668
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,700
We've met your father.

669
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,100
- See you in a moment.
- Take care.

670
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,340
- Father!
[Wink]

671
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,030
[He winks back.]

672
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,010
- What are you doing?
- Take this drink.

673
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,010
Jong Kook helped me.

674
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,760
- It was nice!
- It was very casual.

675
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,570
[Bravo!]

676
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,210
We shouldn't be happy now.

677
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,410
[Kwang Soo is tired after the crisis.]

678
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,210
I don't understand this mission.

679
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,560
Kwang Soo is puzzled.

680
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,270
We shouldn't push him.

681
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,470
He might discover the real race.

682
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,280
Kwang Soo, why is your dad here?

683
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,590
He's providing some
furniture for a drama.

684
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,010
Furniture?

685
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,940
I'm not really sure.

686
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,930
What's wrong with your hair?

687
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,930
I didn't have time to
go to a hair salon.

688
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,820
They should give us more time since
we had to greet Kwang Soo's dad.

689
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,050
[Please, don't act!]

690
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,040
Please!

691
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,190
I can't handle myself.

692
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,170
Suk Jin, you can ruin everything.
Go do your mission quickly.

693
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:03,070
I need to take a selfie.

694
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,310
I'm the only one
who didn't finish the mission.

695
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,270
Did you do it?
Me, too.

696
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,100
I winked at him,
and he winked back at me.

697
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,600
Everyone succeeded their missions.

698
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:22,820
Anyway, Kwang Soo has
to make a heart with his father.

699
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,930
And we need to let it happen.

700
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,670
Kwang Soo has no idea
about our missions.

701
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,480
[Only five minutes left.]

702
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,530
Father, please take a picture
with me.

703
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,930
- I want to post it on SNS.
- You said you'll visit me.

704
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,450
I'm sorry, I'll visit you next time.
This is for my SNS.

705
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,740
- Is it okay if I upload this?
- What will be the title?

706
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,210
Let's take one first.

707
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,850
[Suk Jin succeeds.]

708
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,330
I took it in a way that flatters you.

709
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,680
[Two minutes!]

710
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,940
He shouldn't see us.

711
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,420
Time's up.
Did you find the guest?

712
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,790
Suk Jin!

713
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,790
I couldn't find the guest.

714
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,280
[No one knows that
my father is the guest.]

715
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,610
We only have one minute left!

716
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,590
Dad, let's do it.

717
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,390
Dad, pretend you're leaving.

718
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,270
Walk casually, then make a heart shape
with me near the clock.

719
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,070
We need to go now.

720
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,640
Walk casually toward the clock.

721
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,330
Kwang Soo started his action.

722
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,540
He's doing it.

723
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,310
I don't know what's going on.

724
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,010
Where is the clock?

725
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,710
[The father and the son attempt
to accomplish the mission.]

726
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,640
I'm going to wait here.

727
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,670
20 seconds!

728
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,190
They shouldn't stay together
like that.

729
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,560
Kwang Soo's dad is coming toward here.
Why is he coming here?

730
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,170
- Suk Jin, did you do it?
- Goodbye, Kwang Soo's dad!

731
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,010
- Goodbye!
- Take care!

732
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,080
Let Kwang Soo finish the mission.

733
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,360
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

734
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,560
Stand on the 'R' mark.

735
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,300
- Could it be his dad?
- And make a heart.

736
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,810
Dad, make a heart with me!

737
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,330
We made a heart!
It's a heart!

738
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,640
Kwang Soo's dad!

739
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,330
It was him!

740
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,840
<i>Only Lee Kwang Soo wins!</i>

741
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,310
[Kwang Soo wins the first mission.]

742
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,500
- It's not fair!
- What was that?

743
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,710
[Their hidden camera is successful.]

744
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,740
He was wearing it on his wrist.

745
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,730
I should have checked his wrist.

746
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,840
Thank you for your hard work!
Thank you.

747
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,300
It was really weird.

748
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,730
[We feel bad deceiving him.]

749
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,480
So you don't really know them?

750
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,280
I feel a bit weird.
You were really nice to me.

751
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,930
I feel like you tried
and gave him a chance.

752
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,670
Because you said you're
not the guest.

753
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,010
- They were being polite.
- It's none other than you.

754
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,910
If it wasn't you, Jong Kook would
have dragged the guest by force.

755
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,840
Thank you very much.

756
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,610
<i>Because Kwang Soo won this mission
alone, only he will get a hint.</i>

757
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,870
- Kwang Soo gets a hint by himself?
- You were too nice to me.

758
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,010
- You looked serious.
- You said you're not the guest.

759
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,420
[Hint - You can win
today's race by yourself.]

760
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:14,270
<i>Thank you very much
for being here, Mr. Lee Jong Ho.</i>

761
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,010
Yesterday was my dad's
60th birthday.

762
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,130
I'll treat you with
fish stew in Namyangjoo.

763
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,700
As appreciation, we
prepared something for you.

764
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,440
Open and check before giving him.

765
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,130
Let him open it, Suk Jin.

766
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,010
It's a golden key.

767
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,170
Here, you like gold.

768
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,100
This is embarrassing!

769
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,090
- You've watched Running Man.
- I'm so embarrassed.

770
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,910
Thank you for the gift.

771
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,680
[We're sorry to surprise you,
but thank you again.]

772
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,440
We've succeeded at it again.

773
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,240
Kwang Soo's father is very...

774
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,280
- He reacted quickly.
- It was difficult to spot him.

775
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,070
I think he's better
than Kwang Soo at acting.

776
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,190
I can tell Kwang Soo
by looking at his eyes.

777
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,770
- It seems Kwang Soo didn't sense anything.
- He has no idea.

778
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,600
[The second mission
of 'Desirable Kwang Soo Race.']

779
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,510
This is a really deep pool!

780
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,510
[A huge stage is set out
on an outdoor pool.]

781
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,280
[Six chairs are hanging
on top of the pool.]

782
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,740
[Kwang Soo's private
high quality chair.]

783
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,790
[King Kwang Soo's greets like
a winner at a beauty pageant.]

784
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,280
Is that my chair?

785
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,170
Please get a massage chair
for me next time.

786
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,050
[The rest of the members are wearing
a swim suit underneath their clothing.]

787
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,040
Hurry up and run!

788
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,410
It'll be by order of arrival!

789
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,910
I'll see who arrives last!

790
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,910
First place!

791
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,740
You're the fastest.

792
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,850
- It's only right for you to be the man of power.
- You're right!

793
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,470
You're a good talker today.
Come this way.

794
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,010
How come you're not wearing it?

795
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,220
How come?

796
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,220
[How dare you!]
- I'm sorry.

797
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,010
Please stand in line.

798
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,110
The name of this game is
'As Kwang Soo Says.'

799
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,790
Doesn't it sound fun?

800
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,990
The name of this game is
'As Kwang Soo Says!'

801
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,570
That's right.
Let me explain the rules.

802
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:43,390
You will sit on the chair.

803
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,870
Then I will give you one of
the two numbers you have.

804
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,900
As you can see each
chair has two numbers.

805
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,010
You will have to...

806
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,080
cut the number I call out.

807
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,650
One of the two numbers
will make you fall.

808
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,190
And the other one won't
make you fall even if you cut it.

809
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,880
You're very good at
explaining the rules.

810
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,390
<i>The second mission will be
at a pool.</i>

811
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,140
<i>There will be six chairs hanging
above water that you'll be sitting on.</i>

812
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,500
<i>The important thing
is five members need to fall.</i>

813
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,420
Oh, no!

814
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,160
You need to make a
choice with your hunch.

815
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,250
- I believe in you!
- Please believe in our hunch, too.

816
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,010
You know I'm pretty quick.

817
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,790
You know Ji Hyo is quick-witted.

818
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,640
I start analyzing
as soon as games start.

819
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,930
[Why is that?]

820
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,960
<i>There are two ropes in
front of you.</i>

821
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:03,390
<i>I'll let you know which one
will make you stay even if it's cut.</i>

822
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,840
<i>But Kwang Soo doesn't know that.</i>

823
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,240
We need to lead him.

824
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,300
<i>The numbers that
will make you fall are...</i>

825
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,900
<i>one, four, five, eight, nine,
and eleven.</i>

826
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,470
<i>1,4,5,8,9, and 11.</i>

827
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,020
Upon the January Fourth Retreat,
she made a promise to meet

828
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,850
her Oppa (sounds similar to 58)
on September 11th.

829
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,730
[Will they be able to succeed?]

830
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,270
- Our fates depend on your commands.
- Trust me.

831
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,500
I won't let you fall!

832
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,310
[Trust us, we'll trick Kwang Soo.]
- Good luck!

833
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:45,530
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

834
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,670
I can't do this any longer.

835
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,240
[What?]
- I didn't mean it.

836
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,530
Lee Kwang Soo!

837
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,620
[We'll do whatever you want,
for the hidden camera.]

838
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,800
Let's cheer by doing the waves!

839
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,420
The other direction!

840
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,390
It's been a long time since
I've seen you this happy.

841
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,510
[Be patient for the hidden camera.]

842
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,850
- Should we go in?
- Yes, please!

843
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,540
[While they go to sit on the chair.]

844
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,880
[See me for a second,
Big-nosed brother!]

845
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,190
1,4,5,8,9, and 11.
Were they the numbers for falling?

846
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,790
Or for hanging?
- They're for hanging.

847
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,850
- I think they're for falling.
- No, they're not.

848
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:34,770
I think they're for falling.
What is right?

849
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,960
For number two and four...

850
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,400
Number two and four, go sit.

851
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,450
[Big-nosed brother takes Ji Hyo.]

852
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,400
[Red alert!]

853
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:57,990
[Emergency!
Kwang Soo is approaching!]

854
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,410
- Suk Jin!
[Please stop talking!]

855
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,000
- Are number nine and eleven for falling?
- Yes, they're for falling.

856
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,130
- What did you talk about with her?
- I wanted to switch spots.

857
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,620
[He's suspicious.]

858
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,360
[Just be fooled by the trick....]

859
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,800
- I'm an easy target to you, right?
- No, I was just...

860
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,450
[Thanks to Ji Hyo,
they escape from the crisis.]

861
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,640
Be careful, the water is cold!

862
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,640
[We tricked you!]

863
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,570
[Will they be able to succeed
at this mission?]

864
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,070
<i>For your safety, divers
are ready in water.</i>

865
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,730
We're ready for it!

866
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:55,370
Please raise the chairs!

867
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,130
[The chairs are going up.]

868
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,900
This is good enough!

869
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,650
[Stop!]
- It's good, stop here.

870
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,790
Please raise them up to the max.

871
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,470
You should play this too, Kwang Soo!

872
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,400
[They keep going up...]

873
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,470
Is that all you can do?

874
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,790
Let's show the power of the film set!

875
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,190
It's the maximum.

876
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,190
It feels very far from up here.

877
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,740
Are you ready?

878
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,730
I'm so nervous!

879
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:33,110
I'll make sure that
you'll go home safely.

880
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,100
[Absentmindedly]
- Yeah!

881
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,960
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- That's very good.

882
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,910
- I'll give you an additional points!
- Thank you!

883
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:45,330
We'll start the game.
I'll give you the number.

884
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,040
I believe in you!

885
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,820
Please choose a number
with your loving heart.

886
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,500
Number one!

887
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:57,360
- Number one!
- You made the right choice!

888
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,650
- How about number two?
- No, I don't want it.

889
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,650
- Are you sure it's one?
- Yes!

890
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,560
I recommend number one, too!

891
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,810
- I'm scared!
- Isn't it a good thing to fall?

892
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,340
- I see!
[Gary, you need to fall for the camera.]

893
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,910
Kwang Soo has a good hunch.

894
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,900
I'll cut it now!

895
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,170
Why isn't this cutting?

896
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,840
[Fall!]

897
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,020
[Oh, my!]

898
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,310
- I'm scared!
[It's scary even though they know.]

899
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,300
I've never guessed wrong!

900
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,470
- Everyone!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

901
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,930
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

902
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,480
- LKS!
- Thank you so much!

903
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,470
- I don't regret this!
- That's right!

904
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,000
- How did it feel?
- Wasn't it scary?

905
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,130
I really hate falling.
I want to know if I fall or not.

906
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,570
[Gary is enjoying swimming now.]

907
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,530
Please pick four from
the 'death' for me.

908
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,700
The number on the right side
made Gary fall.

909
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,590
It might be the left number
for the second time.

910
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,990
- I think four is a good number!
- I believe in Kim Jong Kook's hunch!

911
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,130
Can you give me a hint
about which numbers are which?

912
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,790
I guess you want to make me fall.

913
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,090
Is there any way I can get a hint?

914
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,130
Just pick four!

915
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,540
It'll be very funny to see him fall
after he calls out four himself.

916
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,880
- So, you want to cut four?
- Yes!

917
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,960
[Pick four, please.]

918
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,730
I see, then cut four!

919
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,560
One, two, three!

920
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:51,800
- Yeah!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

921
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,270
[Two out of five successfully
fell into the water.]

922
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:03,990
[King Kwang Soo is the
king of misfortune.]

923
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,850
- Kwang Soo, I'll give you some hints.
- I see, just come out.

924
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,500
- How are you feeling?
- It's rather cool!

925
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,790
[I might be staying.]

926
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,760
God Kwang Soo, I feel a bit relieved.

927
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,240
I want to pick the number for him.

928
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,560
What?
Why me?

929
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,620
Why did you touch my computer?

930
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,700
Cut it when I tell you to!

931
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,360
I recommend this number.
Lucky seven!

932
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:35,210
[Lucky seven?]

933
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,390
[The number for a fall is number eight.]

934
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,210
[And he suggests number seven.]

935
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,170
[What a selfish suggestion!]

936
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,160
Lucky seven.

937
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,870
Lucky eight!
Cut the number eight!

938
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,070
- Just listen to me.
- This game is called 'As Kwang Soo says.'

939
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,760
Let me cut seven.

940
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,240
- Just do as Kwang Soo says.
- Cut number eight!

941
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,410
Kwang Soo is the one to pick.

942
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,100
Cut it quickly and fall!

943
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,610
This is not a cheering wave!
You need a break!

944
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,040
- Cut it quickly!
- Seven is for falling.

945
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,790
- No, just cut eight!
- Pick seven!

946
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,840
No, I said eight!

947
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,500
This one is not going to make me fall.

948
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,020
Cut your own life line!

949
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,680
[Big-nosed brother
gives up on surviving.]

950
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,570
Bye, Suk Jin.

951
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,570
[I'm leaving...]

952
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,530
You're amazing, Kwang Soo!

953
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,110
[He picked the right numbers
three times in a row.]

954
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:49,930
- You lost your glasses..
- Your glasses!

955
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,170
I don't care!

956
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,590
[Even with Big-nose's selfishness]

957
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,080
[three of them fell
thanks to King Kwang Soo.]

958
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,210
Now, you have a chance of surviving!

959
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,080
- Between five and six...
- That's difficult.

960
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,590
I want to choose an even number.

961
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,590
Even number?
Number six?

962
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,140
Mine was even number
so pick an odd number.

963
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,900
Odd number!

964
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,210
Odd, odd, odd number!

965
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,560
SBS is...

966
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,640
channel six!

967
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,070
At my house, it's channel five!

968
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,360
Mine is five!

969
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,910
- You have a feeling when you sit on it.
- You do?

970
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,340
- Oh, his body is inclined to left side.
- I told you.

971
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,970
His body is tilted to the
side of number five.

972
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,930
- I'll pick number five!
- Number five?

973
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,390
I don't want to make you fall.

974
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,010
Then... five.
You're not going to change your mind?

975
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,480
[That's lame...]

976
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,370
[A vertical drop!]

977
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,680
[Now four in a row fell into the water.]

978
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,470
[Why am I playing so well?]

979
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,170
Wow, he's incredible.
How can he make all four of us fall?

980
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,440
How about this?

981
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,850
It happened to be a pattern of
odd number and even number.

982
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,390
Pick the odd number and even number.
Then they may survive.

983
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,960
I don't think they kept the pattern.

984
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,370
[Big-nosed brother, am I the target?]

985
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,470
Don't do it.

986
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,160
[Big-nose and Kkuk control Kwang Soo.]

987
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,730
Let us pick our own number!

988
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,250
I will follow your decision.

989
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,240
Listen, Kwang Soo.

990
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,420
Please let me pick my own number!

991
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,870
Please give me that right.

992
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,140
What number do you want to cut then?

993
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,130
What number?

994
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,930
He's thinking.

995
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,710
[What do I do?]
- We don't have much time.

996
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,760
Five, four, three, two...

997
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:56,220
[Haroro's choice is...]
- one!

998
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,410
Number nine!

999
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,360
[Good job.]

1000
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,700
What about you Ji Hyo?

1001
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:08,680
I recommend you number eleven!

1002
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,640
Just pick the odd number
and the even number.

1003
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,940
I'll follow Kwang Soo's opinion.
Odd number and even number.

1004
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,510
- Number twelve?
- Yes.

1005
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:20,680
- Number nine and number twelve!
- No one is on my side?

1006
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,990
Today is Kwang Soo's day!

1007
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,700
Cut it now!

1008
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:28,390
One, two, three!

1009
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,970
[Ha Ha's give.]
- Ji Hyo's turn.

1010
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,970
Ji Hyo!

1011
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,790
[The fifth diver, Ha Ha.]
- Ji Hyo's turn.

1012
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,160
[If Ji Hyo stays,
this mission will succeed.]

1013
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,570
[King Kwang Soo waits for
the result without any doubts.]

1014
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,100
- Ji Hyo survived!
[They succeed at the mission!]

1015
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,250
Ji Hyo survived!

1016
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,240
I survived!

1017
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,700
She is the goddess of fortune.

1018
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,250
Isn't it supposed to happen
as Kwang Soo says?

1019
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,670
It doesn't make sense otherwise.

1020
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,330
It just happened as Kwang Soo said.

1021
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,450
- Didn't you already know the numbers?
- No, I didn't know that.

1022
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,900
Then we've succeeded at
this mission!

1023
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,710
Everyone, we've succeeded
at the mission!

1024
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,620
[They're doing a good job carrying out
the hidden camera missions.]

1025
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,700
['A' aquarium in Ilsan.]

1026
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,390
<i>This is the last mission.</i>

1027
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,450
<i>You'll be separated first.
And we will give you the final mission.</i>

1028
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,870
<i>You have to be separated.</i>

1029
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,560
You can't separate us!

1030
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:45,140
[We cannot be separated
from God Kwang Soo!]

1031
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,620
- What are you doing?
- I'll stay here!

1032
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,480
Let's part for a moment.

1033
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,300
- See you soon!
- I love you, Kwang Soo!

1034
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,870
Don't forget me, Kwang Soo!

1035
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,250
[The race draws to an end.]

1036
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,080
<i>Now, I'll tell you the rules
for the final mission.</i>

1037
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,990
<i>The title is...</i>

1038
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,970
<i>'Be with the King Maker,
Lee Kwang Soo.'</i>

1039
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,880
I like the titles for the missions
very much today.

1040
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,160
<i>The members have to
oust each other.</i>

1041
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,110
<i>The last one to go to the final stage
with the King Maker, Lee Kwang Soo</i>

1042
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:34,450
<i>and put both hands on the station
with the King Maker will win.</i>

1043
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,810
The last one to put the hands
on the station with me?

1044
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,710
One person?

1045
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:48,050
So, if I win with the person,
I'll have to split the reward.

1046
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:52,050
- If I win by myself, I'll have it all?
- Of course.

1047
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,060
If you say so...

1048
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,250
[That's how it works?]

1049
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:06,010
<i>That's what we told Kwang Soo
for the final mission.</i>

1050
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,080
<i>That's the fake rule
that Kwang Soo received.</i>

1051
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,670
But our rule is different.

1052
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:18,530
<i>Survive until the end and
make Kwang Soo betray you.</i>

1053
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,190
<i>If Kwang Soo betrays you...</i>

1054
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,570
and wins by himself, we win.

1055
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,910
<i>Make Kwang Soo betray you
and win by himself.</i>

1056
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:38,200
<i>The last one to go to
the final station with Kwang Soo...</i>

1057
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,930
Wait a moment!
Kwang Soo!

1058
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:51,050
<i>The last survivor will receive
double the prizes.</i>

1059
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,070
You should have told me earlier.

1060
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,590
[Which means...]

1061
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,990
[the members will be
competing against each other?]

1062
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,540
[Who will be the last survivor?]

1063
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,200
[Project 'Let Lee Kwang Soo
win alone', starts!]

1064
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,220
[It's not a name tag elimination!]

1065
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,310
<i>This time, you won't eliminate the
members by ripping the name tags</i>

1066
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,480
<i>instead, you need to find the special
liquid that erases the name tag.</i>

1067
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,640
<i>This crazy liquid is called...</i>

1068
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,390
<i>'Kwang Soo', 'Kwang' from crazy,
and 'Soo' from water.</i>

1069
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,820
Wait, my name doesn't
mean 'crazy water.'

1070
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,820
My name is not Crazy Water!

1071
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,300
<i>Find the crazy water and
erase other members name.</i>

1072
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,420
I can erase the name from the back?

1073
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,440
- Is there a way for them to win solo?
- No.

1074
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,820
<i>They can only win
with the King Maker.</i>

1075
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,940
Wait, are you serious?

1076
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:00,000
Wait for a second.

1077
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,330
Ji Hyo!

1078
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,190
Isn't that too...

1079
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,770
- Did you erase my name?
[This is the power of double prizes.]

1080
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,040
Let's bulldoze out everyone!

1081
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:17,680
- Let's not run away today.
- I won't, this is our last chance.

1082
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,770
Let's show them our will.

1083
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,210
[Gary and Kwang Soo have met.]

1084
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,500
[Big-nose's sudden attack!]
- That's how you play?

1085
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,160
- Yes, that's how I play.
- What are you doing, Kwang Soo?

1086
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:39,010
Kwang Soo!
My head, wait!

1087
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,450
My head!

1088
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,740
[A serious battle between
the men with the crazy water.]

1089
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,590
Stay out of it, Kwang Soo!

1090
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,800
Help me, Suk Jin!

1091
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,110
- Am I ousted?
- Gary is ousted.

1092
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,070
- Do I have my name?
- Ha Ha is ousted, too.

1093
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,210
- How about me?
- You survived.

1094
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,760
You're still alive.

1095
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:13,360
- Good work, Gary!
- Ha Ha was too...

1096
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:17,760
[Gary acts like he's sulking.]

1097
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,240
Why are you making a sad face?

1098
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,270
What did I do?

1099
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,540
That's okay.
I thought you would have helped me.

1100
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,140
[Good luck with the hidden camera!]

1101
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:36,640
[The rest are still fighting.]

1102
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:41,540
[The name tag erasure is going pretty much
the same as the name tag elimination.]

1103
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:45,080
Wait!
Give me a break!

1104
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:53,570
[Let me send you off in peace.]

1105
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,140
[Kwang Soo looks like he's painting.]

1106
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,450
[I know it's for the hidden camera,
but I don't want to end miserably.]

1107
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,440
It's very clean now.

1108
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,820
Wow, this liquid is very powerful.

1109
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,790
[At the jail...]

1110
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,280
You're here.

1111
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,390
I think this is unfair.

1112
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,900
- But we'll win in the end.
- It's really easy to erase Suk Jin.

1113
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:34,430
- Suk Jin should erase Ji Hyo.
- And Suk Jin should stay alive.

1114
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,620
It's easier for Kwang Soo
to betray Suk Jin.

1115
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,360
I...

1116
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:44,250
whoever wins the race out of
you two

1117
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,240
I will congratulate.

1118
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,170
- But I want to see the sincerity.
[He's still alive.]

1119
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:53,020
- I'm serious.
- What do you want me to do?

1120
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,190
Turn around.

1121
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,070
- Me, too?
- I don't mind at all.

1122
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,510
- You don't want to turn around?
- I do.

1123
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:07,330
Never look back!

1124
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,390
Don't turn around!

1125
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,560
Never, ever!

1126
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,300
Do not look back!

1127
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:20,390
I know how much you want
to turn around.

1128
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,560
- But at the moment you turn...
[He's erasing 'Jong.']

1129
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:28,020
- At the moment you turn!
- How many are you erasing?

1130
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,300
- Wait a minute!
- The moment you turn...

1131
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:37,870
- I will be going with the other person.
- You're erasing too much!

1132
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,360
- I see.
- The moment you turn!

1133
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:45,220
- Wait, I won't turn but...
- I can even erase my own name.

1134
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:49,240
- I can erase my own name.
- But you're erasing too much!

1135
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:53,140
[I think you're the target.]
- I don't know what I'll do.

1136
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,360
Wait, wait!

1137
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:58,670
[This is how it ends for me.]

1138
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,100
[Clean]
- Don't ever look back!

1139
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:04,330
You need to go to jail now.

1140
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,950
Why?

1141
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,610
You're ousted, but listen!

1142
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,530
I tested you, and you passed the test!

1143
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,700
You're not supposed to oust me!

1144
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,840
I erased it all before I knew...

1145
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,130
He's unbelievable!

1146
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,470
- I'm moved by you!
[Kkuk enters the jail.]

1147
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,840
- Kwang Soo...
- Jong Kook was sincere to me!

1148
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,250
He's not the one to betray me!

1149
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:39,910
It was difficult.

1150
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,910
You've worked hard!

1151
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,850
I've acted well and was ousted nicely.

1152
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:49,850
I know it was all acting but
you shouldn't have hurt my feelings.

1153
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,840
We're a team.

1154
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,330
We all did it for the bigger picture.

1155
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,610
I understand it, but
didn't you try surviving?

1156
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,330
It was tempting

1157
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:07,020
but it's easier for him to oust me
than betray me in the end.

1158
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,040
But Suk Jin survived.

1159
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,740
The last survivor receives
double the prizes, right?

1160
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,790
That makes people greedy.

1161
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,070
I was a little greedy for a moment.

1162
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,710
You know Suk Jin is greedy.

1163
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,020
You and I are the only ones left.

1164
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,010
Your name is almost gone.

1165
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,790
I, honestly...

1166
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,940
You should think carefully.
You won with me last time.

1167
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,280
I'll be honest.
I can't handle her by myself.

1168
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,240
You should help me
if you want me to win.

1169
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,850
I see.

1170
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,200
[The last battle of crazy water.]
- You have two water guns?

1171
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,280
[Kwang Soo starts an action.]

1172
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,480
[He's rubbing on his palm?]

1173
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,960
[He charges toward Big-nose!]
- It's me he's after!

1174
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:12,710
[Kwang Soo's next target is Big-nose?]

1175
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,650
[He pretended attacking Big-nose
and wiped Blank Ji's name tag!]

1176
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,910
She's ousted.
How did you do it?

1177
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,390
[Song Ji Hyo is ousted.]

1178
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:33,640
Kwang Soo, that was an
awesome tactic!

1179
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,790
- It's a plot twist.
- High five!

1180
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,910
[Kwang Soo makes
Big-nose the final survivor.]

1181
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,620
<i>So, If I win with the person,
I'll have to split the reward.</i>

1182
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,050
<i>If I win by myself,
I'll have it all.</i>

1183
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,820
[If Kwang Soo doesn't betray Suk Jin,
the hidden camera will fail.]

1184
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,930
[Then Kwang Soo will obtain
the full amount of prize.]

1185
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:59,790
<i>If you make Kwang Soo believe
that he wins alone, you win.</i>

1186
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,020
[What will be Kwang Soo's choice?]

1187
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,370
- This is the final stand!
- Awesome, it's the main stage!

1188
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,440
This is how it ends, Suk Jin.

1189
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:14,070
I didn't really plan to pick someone.

1190
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,590
I was worried but I never knew
you would be the one.

1191
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,500
This is a meaningful gift of 2015 to me.

1192
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:25,960
Yes, can we proceed now?

1193
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:30,440
Put your hands on it.
You've worked so hard.

1194
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,120
Can I just put my hands, too?

1195
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,960
[That's it, Kwang Soo.]

1196
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,990
[He's pretending he didn't see it.]

1197
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,620
[As I expected, you are...]

1198
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,140
[He rubs his hand with the crazy water.]

1199
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,430
[And casually puts it
on Suk Jin's back.]

1200
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,420
Thank you so much.

1201
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,170
[Wiping]

1202
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,680
[He never disappoints me.]
- Wow, this is amazing!

1203
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,080
Awesome!

1204
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,300
<i>Ji Suk Jin is ousted.
Go to jail now!</i>

1205
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,910
<i>Leave at this moment!</i>

1206
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,930
What do you mean?

1207
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,270
Wait!
Why am I ousted?

1208
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,770
I haven't won solo in years!

1209
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,990
You're the loser! This is what you get
for looking at other people's computer!

1210
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,190
Seriously, you... in 2015...

1211
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,160
- I'm serious!
- Yes!

1212
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,810
I haven't won solo for a long time!

1213
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:33,330
Lee Kwang Soo!

1214
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:37,160
I think we completely deceived him.

1215
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,680
It worked out well, right?

1216
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:43,100
Double prizes for me, right?

1217
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,310
[Thank you so much, Kwang Soo!]

1218
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,970
['The hidden camera -Let Kwang Soo win'
was successful, but it wasn't over yet.]

1219
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,990
Welcome back!

1220
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,390
- Aren't you supposed to keep one member?
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1221
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,220
There was supposed to be two, to
succeed the mission. Right?

1222
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,500
Lee Kwang Soo, you petty...

1223
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,710
You said two people should
stand on the final stage.

1224
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,640
I will never trust you!

1225
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:12,590
After you came to my house,
the first mission with my dad...

1226
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,130
the hint I won was...

1227
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,790
'Winning solo is possible.'

1228
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,470
They gave me the hint
at the time.

1229
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,730
Why letting only Kwang Soo know?

1230
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,040
Suk Jin wanted to win.

1231
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,570
I'm sorry, but I never
thought I'd win with you.

1232
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:32,810
Unbelievable!

1233
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,820
He doesn't watch TV unless
he wins these days.

1234
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,620
- He's going to watch this episode for sure.
- What are you talking about?

1235
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,590
[Soon, we'll show you how
he feels about it live.]

1236
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,130
Anyway, the winner for this race...

1237
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,540
is Lee Kwang Soo!

1238
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,530
This isn't right!

1239
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,640
We'll transfer the money on wire now.

1240
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,560
[He won't receive the prize.]
- Thank you!

1241
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:00,330
Thank you everyone!

1242
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,560
<i>Thank you everyone!
Cut!</i>

1243
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,490
Thank you.

1244
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,390
[If Kwang Soo goes home like this,
the hidden camera will succeed!]

1245
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,570
- I'm going to eat you up someday!
- Thank you for your hard work!

1246
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:13,740
- Kwang Soo!
- So we could have won solo.

1247
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,850
- Only he knew about that.
- That hint was for everyone?

1248
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:19,990
I received the hint.

1249
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,680
Kwang Soo, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1250
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,040
[After Kwang Soo left...]

1251
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,760
<i>Congratulations on winning!</i>

1252
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,790
[Kwang Soo might hear us.]

1253
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,360
<i>Here's the envelopes for you.</i>

1254
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:47,370
You're giving us a million Won each?

1255
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:53,420
Ji Suk Jin was the last survivor
so we're giving him double.

1256
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,870
I'll treat everyone.

1257
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:02,010
At first, we felt really sorry for Kwang Soo
for visiting him without any prior notice.

1258
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,740
This time, Kwang Soo kept betraying us.

1259
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,640
If he didn't eliminate me
and finished the final stage...

1260
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,740
then theses envelopes would be his.

1261
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,650
If you stayed with us, these
prizes would all belong to you.

1262
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:18,930
In fact, he's the betrayer.

1263
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,360
Anyway, we'll leave the site.

1264
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,570
- Kwang Soo, this could've been yours.
- Let's leave here.

1265
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:32,450
[Lee Kwang Soo didn't have any ideas about
the hidden camera before it broadcasted.]

1266
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,570
Don't let him know until he watches TV.

1267
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:40,480
[How are you feeling, Kwang Soo?]

1268
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:46,210
- Hello, everyone!
- This is a live broadcast.

1269
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:50,360
Is everyone enjoying the weekend?

1270
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:52,770
It was a Happy Hidden Camera
for Kwang Soo.

1271
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:56,740
We're here at Lee Kwang Soo's house.
And this is a live broadcast.

1272
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,990
Let's hear what he has to say.

1273
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,440
Did you know it was a hidden camera?

1274
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,730
I had no idea.

1275
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,590
I have goosebumps now!

1276
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,590
How do you feel after
watching Running Man?

1277
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,590
I'm happy for making the
audiences laugh, but...

1278
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,990
- it's frustrating!
- He's been tricked for two weeks.

1279
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,730
For two weeks, Kwang Soo
had no idea about this.

1280
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:21,930
- We arrived here a moment ago.
- I feel dizzy.

1281
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:27,110
- Do you have anything you want to say?
- I will take revenge no matter what!

1282
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:31,540
I will take revenge in person,
if you don't let me on Running Man.

1283
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,930
The viewers are watching.

1284
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,140
We are broadcasting live now.

1285
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,840
<i>- 10 seconds left!
- It's time to say goodbye.</i>

1286
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:44,380
We'll come back with another
exciting race next week!

1287
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:47,310
- Have a good rest of the weekend!
- Have a good weekend!

1288
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:48,990
At Lee Kwang Soo's house...

1289
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,730
- I'm Yoo Jae Suk.
- I'm Ji Suk Jin.

1290
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,770
- I'm Lee Kwang Soo.
- See you next week!
