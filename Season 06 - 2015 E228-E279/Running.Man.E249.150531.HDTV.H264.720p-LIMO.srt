[There will be a competition
that is savory like the noodles!]

- A cold americano.
- One caramel macchiato.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Suk Jin, did you get
your penalty yesterday?

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,020
- I thought I was going to die.
- Was it bearable?

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,790
Are you kidding?
It's 50 meters!

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,650
Once again, congratulations.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
He's like a long lost brother to me.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,020
You are close again, thanks to me.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,560
- Everything was solved because of Suk Jin.
- A happy ending.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,790
- I think it'll be different today.
- We're wearing black suits.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,460
What is it today?

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,480
[A steel container?]

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,430
- Huh?
- What is it?

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,430
[What is this intense atmosphere?]

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,170

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,360
[And another guest hidden by Jun Hyun.]

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,160
[I just saw her.]

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,620
[A lady that lit up the cafe!]

[A surprising visit out of nowhere!]

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,310
They're my real sister and brother!

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,420
It's been a long time, UEE!

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,160
[Here are your drinks.]

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,510
Jun Hyun, you're finally here.

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,730
[Welcome!]

34
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,390
UEE, you've lost so much weight!

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,790
You're getting prettier.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,940
[A goddess-like appearance compared
to Jun Hyun's generous appearance.]

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,990
- Jun Hyun!
- She's pretty.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,330
- You've started sweating.
- Yes.

39
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,080
He was eating at my
restaurant yesterday, at dawn.

40
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,450
- Who?
- Jun Hyun.

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,130
He ate a lot.

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,880
Today, we have the glutton king
Jun Hyun who never gets full.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,110
- Yes.
- He's the best.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,310
He is the killer of the gluttons.

45
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,130
And we have UEE who never loses
her s-line even after she eats.

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,480
She lost so much weight.
Her face is so small.

47
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,990
She's an idol killer.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
She doesn't do anything,
but they all fall for her.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Just date some of them!

50
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,760
So many people want your attention!

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,330
Geez, you're making things awkward!

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,020
Today, after completing several missions,
you will complete a blacklist.

53
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,020
It is an individual match.

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh, it's an individual race.

55
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,790
The first person to complete
the blacklist will be the winner.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,730
First, you must go to the mission site
and earn a hint about the blacklist.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,050
The location is near Seoul,
unusual jjajang restaurants.

58
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,640
Jjajangmyun restaurant.
(Black bean noodle restaurant)

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,960
I love black bean noodles!

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,360
[The black bean noodles
they will soon experience.]

61
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,190
It looks so good!

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,050
- This looks good.
- I want to eat this.

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,220
It looks good.
It has sujebi (hand-pulled dough) in it.

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,480
It kind of looks like ravioli.

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,330
It's black bean sujebi.
It's unique.

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,990
It's white jjajang!

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,390
I know this, I think I've tried.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,620
- It's good.
- It is?

69
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,080
At first it tastes like soybean paste,
then it tastes like jjajang.

70
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,990
And if you put a little bit of
vinegar, it's amazing.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,220
- You're an expert.
- You need to know beforehand!

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,730
There's a hammer?

73
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,530
- What is this?
- Oh, are there noodles inside?

74
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,820
Oh, you break it!

75
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,790
Oh, that's really good.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,420
- How do you know all of them?
- It's fun to crack it.

77
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,710
Where is that?
I want to eat that one!

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,730
The roof of your mouth
can be grazed with that one.

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,310
- Wow!
- That's red jjajang.

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,710
I'm going crazy.

81
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,190
They all look so good.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,790
- Isn't it spaghetti?
- It looks like spaghetti.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,960
I should start my blog again!

84
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,250
You never had a blog!

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,330
I can start one up!

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,850
I want this!
I want to eat this!

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,160
- Oh my gosh!
- Let's go together!

88
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,250
It looks so good.

89
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,080
This is the one for me.

90
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,650
Wow, they all look so good.

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm feeling the jjajang sujebi
and the iron griddle jjajang.

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,430
I want white jjajang.

93
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,250
- I'm feeling the hammer...
- I want the red jjajang.

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,190
Hammer, red, and iron griddle.

95
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,110
If you say it, do you get it?

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
No, it's just our wish list.

97
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,330
Jun Hyun said this on his program.

98
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,250
He really wanted to express
his love for jjajang.

99
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,420
He said 'I am black bean noodles!'
He really wanted to express his love.

100
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,310
I'm Kim Jjajang.

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,220
Don't say you love
jjajang in front of me.

102
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,450
- I love black bean noodles.
- No! I do.

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,480
There is a condition for each location.

104
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,110
Only two people are allowed per location.

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,250
UEE is my cousin so I'll go with her.

106
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,760
Aren't you Yoo EE?

107
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,910
You don't look alike!

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,190
You will pick your order
with chopsticks.

109
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,820
They are numbered.

110
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,680
I really want to go with Jun Hyun.

111
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,760
I want to see him eating in person.

112
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,730
I'm fifth.

113
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,590
I'm second.

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
UEE's first.

115
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,510
[Depressed Jun.]

116
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,820
Do I just pick what I want to eat?

117
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,960
You can take the one you want.

118
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,330
Can't I pick the person
I want to go with?

119
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,330
Who do you want to go with?

120
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,850
Kwang Soo's more handsome now.

121
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,110
[What do I do...]

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,850
[Uncomfortable.]

123
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
You...

124
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,160
Don't hurt him!

125
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,590
Don't get his hopes up.

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,420
She's an idol killer.

127
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,480
Why are you saying this?

128
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,220
Why are you getting his hopes up?

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,280
He's taking it the wrong way!

130
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,310
UEE, you're mean.

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,990
I'll pick now.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,250
I recommend jjajang sujebi.

133
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,050
Then, I'll take that one.

134
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,680
Last time, Kwang Soo and UEE
played the cookie stick game.

135
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,250
- I'll take the white jjajang.
- Because it looks healthy?

136
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,930
He chooses the one with
the least amount of sauce.

137
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,020
Okay, for you I'll choose white jjajang.

138
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,820
- White jjajang!
- It's been a while.

139
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,250
I really wanted to eat
white jjajang, though.

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,560
Kwang Soo!

141
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,360
He's already fallen for her!

142
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,520
Make UEE restless today.

143
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,310
UEE, what's your ideal type?

144
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,540
You're my type.

145
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,020
Oh my god!

146
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,530
- You've changed, UEE.
- She's scary.

147
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,130
Jjajang sujebi!

148
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,910
I love jjajang sujebi!

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,190
- He's so predictable.
- I want the iron griddle.

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,190
It suits you!

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,850
I want the red jjajang!

152
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,530
- I'll take the iron griddle!
- I want the hammer jjajang!

153
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,710
[Red jjajang vs. hammer jjajang.]
[What will Jun Hyun's choice be?]

154
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,340
Don't you think it'd be
funny if he went alone?

155
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,710
I think it would be really
funny if you went alone.

156
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,730
He has really good sense!

157
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,850
I'll eat the hammer jjajang.

158
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,710
Wow!

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,250
I have to eat alone?

160
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,960
This is an important point in my career.

161
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,030
[Denying the fact.]
That's your fate!

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,600
Go, Yoo Min Sang!
(Another fat comedian)

163
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,080
[What will their jjajang road be like?]

164
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,120
[Sujebi, hammer, red,
iron griddle, and white jjajang.]

165
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,480
[One and only in Korea.]

166
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,190
[A feast of the unique
black bean noodles!]

167
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,520
<i>You'll find a hint
about the blacklist!</i>

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,220
I really love black bean noodles.

169
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,850
There are times where I've
had it for all three meals.

170
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,680
- Really?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,530
Fried dumplings are the best with jjajang.

172
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,230
- You have to eat them with your hands.
- Yes.

173
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,930
When the person next to you
eats spicy seafood noodle soup

174
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,770
you want to have some of that, too.

175
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,050

353
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,130
[Green tea.]

354
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,160
[Put the two together.]

355
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,510
- Green, tea.
- Green tea!

356
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,930
[Eight questions right.]

357
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,390
[Now, add noodles and fry together.]

358
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,450
Mumble mumble, twist.

359
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,430
- Twist?
- What type of twist?

360
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,850
Shanghai.

361
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,130
[Put the noodles in the tortilla.
And it's complete.]

362
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,250
[Place it on the plate.]

363
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,250
[One hammer jjajang.]

364
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,990
[Wong Fei-hung.]

365
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,390
[Hammer jjajang is done.]

366
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,760
You're out of time!

367
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,930
I had one left...

368
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,650
[He showed amazing skills.]

369
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,960
- What was the last question?
- Wong Fei-hung. Thank you.

370
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,930
We were really great.

371
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,050
You were awesome for green tea.

372
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,130
[Will they be able to succeed...]

373
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,740
Thank you so much.

374
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,530
<i>Kwang Soo and UEE will be</i>

375
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,080
guessing what object is in the container.

376
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,790
You have to guess correctly
before your order comes out.

377
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,020
The one who gets it correctly
will get to eat it.

378
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,730
If neither of you gets it right,
we'll eat it.

379
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,390
You're so cruel.

380
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,930
Let's eat it together.

381
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,420
Let's start UEE.

382
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,760
Hold on, I think I got too excited.

383
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,160
UEE, turn around.

384
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,280
UEE needs to change first.

385
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,190
I lost a lot of weight.

386
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,880
It's only been an hour.

387
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,080
And her face changed already.

388
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,850
One black bean sujebi, please.

389
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,560
Please.

390
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,160
<i>The order has been made,
let's start.</i>

391
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,710
[Start by boiling the hand-pulled dough.]

392
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,760
[This is chewier than noodles.]

393
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,510
Please open it once.

394
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,590
[Guess the object inside
the steel container.]

395
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,650
Pay close attention.

396
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,030
[What was that?]

397
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,420
Hold on!
Sir, there's nothing at the bottom.

398
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,850
We haven't seen anything yet!

399
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,790
[A clear view.]
Me!

400
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
A turtle?

401
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,790
- No?
- Why would there be a turtle?

402
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,450
It looked like a turtle.

403
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,530
[The Sujebi jjajang is being made.]

404
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,450
Have you tried the cheesy
sweet and sour pork?

405
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,990
It's our first time here.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,680
Hurry!
It's being fried right now!

407
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,390
Sir..! Fire...
It's already frying!

408
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,480
[The seafood is already fried.]

409
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,420
Sir, uh sir.

410
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,720
Okay, it's opening.

411
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,930
[The answer is a mussel shell.]

412
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,480
[Did they see it?]

413
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,850
Oh, I saw it!

414
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,820
I saw it, I saw it!

415
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,370
A fan-mussel shell.
No?

416
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,020
- It isn't?
- It's starting to smell!

417
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,820
That's not the answer?

418
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,360
[Add the boiled sujebi and
seafood and fry together.]

419
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,030
[The food is almost ready.]

420
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,080
[This is the last chance.]

421
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,390
Answer!

422
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,910
- Black bean sujebi is done!
- No, no!

423
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,110
[We're doomed.]

424
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,330
- Black bean sujebi is ready!
- No no, please wait!

425
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,250
The double portion isn't ready!

426
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,530
[First round, failed.]

427
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,510
- You failed the first round.
- No, wait!

428
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,120
It looks so good!

429
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,880
It smells incredible.

430
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,910
I didn't have lunch.

431
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,530
[The black bean sujebi
goes to the staff.

432
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,770
This house's specialty is Sujebi,
so you have to eat with a spoon.

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
- It's seafood.
- Please get ready for round two.

434
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,220
[He takes a bite without
knowing their pain.]

435
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,230
You were really close.
It's a shame.

436
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,220
Try harder in round two.

437
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,110
[While UEE and
Kwang Soo are devastated...]

438
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,850
One, two, three!

439
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,800
One seafood iron griddle
jjajang, please!

440
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,390
[Add ingredients to the hot wok.]

441
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,790
[Take the massive order mission.]

442
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,280
One sweet and sour rice cake.

443
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,480
Three iron griddle jjajang.

444
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,280
One Szechuan sweet and sour pork.

445
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,280
Five spicy squid noodle soup,
and two rice with assorted seafood.

446
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,930
One spicy jjajang,
and one old style jjajang.

447
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,730
You can't do cold spicy noodle?

448
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,260
Then I'll just get a seafood
scorched rice soup.

449
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,770
Thank you.

450
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,680
Order!

451
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,680
One sweet and sour rice cake.

452
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,960
Three iron griddle jjajang.

453
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,850
One spicy jjajang,
and one old style jjajang

454
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,960
And then, no cold noodles?

455
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,510
[Fry the seafood and vegetables together.]

456
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
One Szechuan sweet and sour pork.

457
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,050
Can we get two dim sum buns?

458
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,080
On the house?
[Round one, fail.]

459
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,850
- I almost had it!
- One sweet and sour rice cake.

460
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,170
One old-style jjajang
and one jumbo jjajang.

461
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,830
[Wrong.]

462
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,020
What do we do?

463
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,480
Yes, please tell us again.

464
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,250
[The iron griddle has to be hot!]

465
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,730
[Add the mushrooms,
and it's almost ready.]

466
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,020
Order!

467
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,020
One sweet and sour rice cake.

468
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,560
Three iron griddle jjajang.

469
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,130
One seafood scorched rice soup.

470
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,620
One Szechuan sweet and sour pork.

471
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,130
One spicy jjajang,
and one old style jjajang.

472
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,620
Five spicy squid noodle soup.

473
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,020
[Will Gary succeed?]

474
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,560
It wasn't the scorched rice soup...
What else?

475
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,620
Two rice with assorted seafood!

476
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,250
[Gary, mission success!]

477
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,400
[Mr. Random capable didn't even
know he could memorize so well.]

478
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,420
[It's almost done.]

479
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,820
Just give him one spicy noodle!

480
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,850
One iron griddle jjajang!

481
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,530
[Wrong.]
That's not it?

482
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,650
- Okay!
- You can't make cold spicy noodles.

483
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,220
Yes, we can make cold spicy noodles.
It's our new menu.

484
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,050
One assorted scorched rice soup.

485
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,650
One Szechuan sweet and sour pork.

486
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,920
[One iron griddle jjajang.]

487
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,280
[Gary succeeds, Big-nose fails.]

488
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,730
This is crazy.
I don't think I'll be able to eat.

489
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,220
I can't memorize it.

490
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm going blank.

491
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,250
Will you wait, or eat first?

492
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
I have to eat first.

493
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,990
Do you want to do that?

494
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,910
I will taste it first.

495
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,720
I'll eat the squid first.

496
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,520
How is it?

497
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,560
Can't I have some?

498
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,510
This isn't a reaction.

499
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,760
I only ate one squid.

500
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,310
It's crazy.

501
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,510
You don't even need the pickled radish.

502
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,800
[I want to eat...]

503
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,710
It looks really good.

504
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,130
Why does it look so good?

505
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,330
Stop blowing it here!

506
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,170
Don't blow it!

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Then he doesn't need to do it again?

508
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm getting angry.

509
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,650
You know when you get so
angry because it's too good?

510
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,450
In case someone steals it.

511
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,910
It looks too good.

512
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,880
You can't eat it all by yourself.

513
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,420
My mouth is watering.

514
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,910
I think it's been 10 years
since my mouth watered.

515
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,130
But honestly, it's so good.

516
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,330
No joke.

517
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,050
I've never tasted anything like it!

518
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,410
I don't know if I can eat it today,
it's too hard.

519
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,560
How did you memorize it?

520
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,360
He's a rapper.

521
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,740
[Will Big-nose be able to taste it...]

522
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,310
[Meanwhile, the white jjajang team.]

523
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,650
[Here is the white jjajang.]

524
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,820
The smell.

525
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,930
The smell isn't like Jjajang.

526
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,450
It's just really savory.

527
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,370
It smells like potatoes.

528
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,880
My mouth is watering.

529
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,140
I should use the spoon.

530
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,520

719
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,990
You can take one of these.

<i>You can't take the ingredient
if you already have it.</i>

723
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,600
<i>Therefore, It's better to choose
an ingredient that no one has.</i>

724
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,770
Of course, the noodle and
the sauce are the main things.

725

But everyone will think of these two.

726
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,110
I think they will pick
pickled radish or chopsticks.

727
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,130
But that's why they could pick noodles.

728
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,890
But then, they might
rather choose sweet peas.

729
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I'll choose the chopsticks.

730

731

I think they wouldn't
have picked sweet peas.

732
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,850
I choose sweet peas.

733
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,930
I need to have what they don't have.

734
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,720
Then, I choose green peas.

735
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,340
Anyone could have picked sweet peas,
but I'll still pick sweet peas.

736
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,340
Is choosing chopsticks a bad idea?

737
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,890
I choose black bean sauce.

Without it, it's not jjajangmyun.

this strong before.

takes care of the house now.

[to technique!]

968
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,340
[She must be a member of the Fighter Club
rather than Ex-girlfriend club.]

969

This is not the way I planned!

970

in between games.

[Ha Ha's instinct for survival]
If his feet were out...

Should I step out or not...

1001
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,720
But it was too late.

1225
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,480
'Killing Restaurant.'

1226
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:45,420
This time, it's totally different
from the previous games.

1227
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,880
When you win this one on one match

1228
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:53,200
you will be able to check your
opponent's items and take one away.

1229
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,760
[This is a real battle!]

1230
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,360
Do we fail if we lose?

1231
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,910
If you lose, you'll be ousted.

1232
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,620
Players with one ingredient

1233
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,860
have to win four games
in order to collect five items.

1234
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:12,710
But some may need to win twice.

1235
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,960
The way to play this game is...

1236
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,400
You see the number table?

1237
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,130
Pick a number and
put the jjajang plate on it.

1238
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,680
<i>Then put spicy noodle around it.</i>

1239
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,050
<i>And fill the other numbers with red vinegar.</i>

1240
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,620
<i>If we find the spicy noodle...</i>

1241
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,590
<i>then you can guess where the jjajang is.</i>

1242
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,220
<i>You will take turns, and call a number</i>

1243
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,800
<i>that you think your opponent has jjajang.</i>

1244
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,330
<i>If you make your opponent eat their jjajang</i>

1245
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,330
<i>they will be ousted.</i>

1246
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,510
It's like a mine sweeper.

1247
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,160
Do we get to eat before we're ousted?

1248
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,050
That's not too bad, then.

1249
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,560
At least, we get to eat.

1250
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,160
[The True House]

1251
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:02,990
From now on, decide where you
want to put your jjajang.

1252
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,330
Start!

1253
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:10,020
What a good battle it is!
[Guess where the jjajang is!]

1254
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,280
It's fun to watch this.

1255
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,710
All of a sudden, Kwang Soo looks smart.

1256
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,450
[At least, you figured it out now.]

1257
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,400
[Kwang Soo's jjajang is on 14.]
[Jae Suk's jjajang is on 12.]

1258
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,760
<i>We'll begin now.</i>

1259
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:28,130
One of you won't be able to
participate in this mission.

1260
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:33,020
- If you choose it well...
- You could end it right away.

1261
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,530
I'll choose now.

1262
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,650
Number 15!

1263
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,660
Number 15!

1264
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:53,250
It's not even funny!

1265
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,850
He's drinking it so dramatically!

1266
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,680
They will install this game in Las Vegas.

1267
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:04,570
They will use liquor with these noodles.

1268
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:09,400
[Let me pick the same spot as mine.]

1269
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,400
[They're like a reflection on a mirror.]

1270
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,730
Number 14.

1271
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,190
Hurry up and eat it.

1272
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,540
I'll give you another chance!

1273
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,540
Number 14!

1274
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,560
Is it spicy noodle or jjajang?

1275
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:44,020
He picked his chopsticks.
Which noodle is it?

1276
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,730
Jjajang means you're over.

1277
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,220
[What is it?]

1278
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:53,130
That's jjajang!

1279
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,080
Is it jjajang?

1280
01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:00,170
Jackpot!

1281
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,910
- What just happened?
- I can't believe it!

1282
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,960
- It was his first guess!
- He's very sharp!

1283
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:10,020
Then he has three ingredients.

1284
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,820
I can't believe it, either.

1285
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,530
We need to stop Jae Suk.

1286
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:17,820
Open it and check Kwang Soo's items.

1287
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,860
[The winner can pick
one of the loser's items.]

1288
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,770
This is upsetting!

1289
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,850
Wow, this is...

1290
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,400
What a coincidence!

1291
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,280
How could it be?

1292
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:35,090
Close it and get out!
Just watch how I play the game.

1293
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,080
Ji Suk Jin!

1294
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:41,530
Don't worry.
I'll finish him off.

1295
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,450
You know, I finish off
almost everyone these days.

1296
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,630
I haven't won a complete victory yet.

1297
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,590
I almost had it.

1298
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,970
Please arrange your table.

1299
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,730
It's very interesting.

1300
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,890
Kwang Soo passed the other
games with flying colors.

1301
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:04,260
I guess he can fly to his home now.

1302
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,910
- We can't watch it next to them?
- No, we should watch it on the screen.

1303
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,970
- I'm going to hold my breath.
- Should we start now?

1304
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,000
Number seven!

1305
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,710
[He grabs his chopsticks?]

1306
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,620
[Maybe it was close.]

1307
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:29,720
- This is getting interesting!
- It's not for the vinegar, is it?

1308
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,460
[This is how I drink red vinegar.]

1309
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:37,920
[A fierce war of nerves]

1310
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,530
These two are the generation that
watched film noir when they were young.

1311
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,690
Number 17!

1312
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,200
[Jae Suk barely missed the noodles.]

1313
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,790
[Bottoms up, the film noir way.]

1314
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,540
Chow Yun-Fat used to do that.
Why do you want to do it?

1315
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:10,000
Number... 13!

1316
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,790
Number 18!

1317
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,970
[Manly man's bottom's up.]

1318
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,020
[Big-nosed brother... please...]

1319
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,400
The red vinegar is coming out of your nose!

1320
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,160
This was the vinegar.

1321
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,080
They think they're cool when they do it.

1322
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,430
Do you really think you
look cool by doing it?

1323
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,190
Number nine!

1324
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,880
That was the vinegar again?

1325
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,330
Number 24.

1326
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,280
Number 24?

1327
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,620
It's about time to pick noodles.

1328
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,330
Yes, it's about time.

1329
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,130
[24? You might have it around the number.]

1330
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,160
Number... 23!

1331
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:08,620
[He picked Jae Suk's jjajang.]

1332
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,420
Hope it's a noodle.
Chopsticks?

1333
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:15,650
Jjajang!

1334
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,850
Yeah!

1335
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,600
I got it right!

1336
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,720
[Jae Suk who had three items is ousted.]

1337
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,200
You might be able to get
close to winning again.

1338
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,340
Yes, I feel like I'm lucky again.

1339
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,340
[Suk Jin acquires chopsticks from Jae Suk.]

1340
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,020
UEE!

1341
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,910
How many items do you have?

1342
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,540
- I have one.
- Just one?

1343
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,560
I have two.

1344
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,220
[Oh yeah?]

1345
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,960
UEE looks like she wants to beat him.

1346
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,820
Look at her face.

1347
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,080
I really want to beat Suk Jin.

1348
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:55,880
[Why me?]
What's the reason?

1349
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,940
All the female guests want to beat me.

1350
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,930
- Can I start?
- Sure.

1351
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,760
Number 14.

1352
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,570
Fourteen?

1353
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,340
Then, number 14 for you.

1354
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:25,710
It's like watching a soju commercial.

1355
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,720
Number seven.

1356
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,660
[Suk Jin's corner strategy
seems it's working.]

1357
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,080
Number seven for you, too.

1358
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,780
He's really good!

1359
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,320
Number seven.

1360
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,330
Do you want me to choose another number?

1361
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,820
Number seven?
I love you.

1362
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,330
Do you want another number?

1363
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,930
All of a sudden, she loves me.

1364
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,310
UEE is weird.

1365
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,560
She wanted to beat him.

1366
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,250
Then, number eight.

1367
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,520
[Number eight!]

1368
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:10,400
[She tried to avoid the spicy noodle,
but now he picked jjajang.]

1369
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,130
[What a bad luck!]

1370
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,820
- I prefer number seven.
- You do?

1371
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,850
What difference does it make?

1372
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,940
Number eight!

1373
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,420
[I've lost to Suk Jin...]

1374
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:29,130
[Big-nose acquires the
bean sauce from UEE.]

1375
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,420
Jun Hyun!

1376
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,260
Jun Hyun.

1377
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,720
Number four!

1378
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,570
[His lucky-nose came back again!]

1379
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:42,290
[He gives Jun Hyun jjajang as a gift.]

1380
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,530
[Suk Jin acquires the pickled radish.]

1381
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:50,830
[Four ingredients are collected.]
I think it's going to happen today!

1382
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,260
[Can he get a complete victory today?]

1383
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:58,050
[But the problem is...]

1384
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,590
[He is the problem.]

1385
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,720
[The natural enemy of the Lucky-nose.]
[Mr. Capable]

1386
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:08,230
I can't forget the cream pie incident.

1387
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,080
- Break it?
- Break it!

1388
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,370
Let me break it.
Come Kim Jong Kook!

1389
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:15,620
I'll pass over you, Mr. Capable today!

1390
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:20,620
[Will the Lucky-nose be able
to have a complete victory?]

1391
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:24,420
If Suk Jin wins this round,
then he's the winner.

1392
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:27,030
In any case, Suk Jin is the
closest person to winning.

1393
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,530
Yes, today is my day!

1394
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,850
If Kim Jong Kook wins this round

1395
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,310
The rest of the members have
the ingredients Suk Jin needs.

1396
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,050
If Jong Kook wins, there
won't be any winners today.

1397
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,390
Which means Jong Kook's ingredients

1398
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,200
are the same as what
Gary, Ha Ha, and Ji Hyo has.

1399
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,910
- Then Jong Kook...
- He's just blocking me from winning.

1400
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,280
- Let Suck Jin win or...
- ruin his victory.

1401
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,770
If Kim Jong Kook stops
Suk Jin from winning

1402
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,030
the prize for today's game
will be forwarded to next week.

1403
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:05,790
- That's it!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1404
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,360
- Kim Jong Kook!
- I'll surpass Mr. Capable!

1405
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,650
Let's go!

1406
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,420
[Big-nose vs. Mr. Capable]

1407
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,520
[Relaxed]

1408
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,730
You spilled the red vinegar!

1409
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:24,160
[Why do I feel small in front of him?]
I'm sorry.

1410
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:27,460
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are.

1411
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:34,290
Let me call the number
that I keep thinking of.

1412
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,960
Number eight.

1413
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:43,650
[Is it a noodle?]

1414
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:46,160
[It's red vinegar.]

1415
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,860
Mr. Capable is strong,
but I have four items.

1416
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,710
This can be the end.

1417
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,620
Number nine!

1418
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,310
Number nine?

1419
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,110
[Oh no!]

1420
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,190
[He grabs his chopsticks.]

1421
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,390
This is happening earlier than I thought.

1422
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,710
Will the cream pie incident repeat?

1423
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,570
I think I've seen it before.

1424
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,110
Mr. Capable!

1425
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,560
[Big-nosed brother, is
eating the spicy noodle.]

1426
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:24,370
[If nine is spicy noodles,
jjajang can be on 4, 8, 10, or 14.]

1427
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,220
[It's Mr. Capable's turn again.]

1428
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,370
Number 10.

1429
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,370
[Startled]

1430
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:40,690
[Is number 10 jjajang?]

1431
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,660
[It's red vinegar.]

1432
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,880
[Okay... I see...]

1433
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:51,160
I think Jong Kook figured it out.

1434
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,280
He knows.

1435
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,930
It's set.

1436
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,050
Since it's Big-nosed brother...

1437
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,260
Number 19!

1438
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,200
It should be noodles.

1439
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:12,530
It's certainly the red vinegar.

1440
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:15,600
- The noir generation.
- I'm 'going to' know it.

1441
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,920
What? He's 'going to' know?

1442
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:22,970
I can't lose to him.
What number?

1443
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:26,430
Number 14!

1444
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,200
[Huh? Is he smiling?]
Number 14?

1445
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:37,600
[Did he avoid jjajang this time again?]

1446
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,200
[He picked jjajang.]

1447
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:49,540
[Again, Big-nose has been defeated
by Mr. Capable, right before winning.]

1448
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,660
You!

1449
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,020
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Next week, we can...

1450
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:58,250
He's really mean!

1451
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,030
- We will carry the prize forward!
- Why is he doing this to me?

1452
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,880
Does he have a special
power or something?

1453
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:06,770
We'll have to play harder next week.

1454
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,460
Since Kim Jong Kook stopped
Ji Suk Jin from winning

1455
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,420
this race has no winner.

1456
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:18,880
The prize will be forwarded to next week

1457
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:22,230
but Jun Hyun and UEE don't have
a chance to win the prize.

1458
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,890
Thanks to you, especially Jun Hyun
I had a really good meal.

1459
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,570
UEE was enjoying it so much, as well.

1460
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:30,390
Thank you for coming!

1461
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,370
[Hope they had a good time.]

1462
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:37,630
[The men who are summoned from the past.]

1463
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:40,490
[The Roman gladiators, Big Bang
are visiting from the past!]

1464
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,490
<i>Car racing?</i>

1465
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,170
[The only way for them
to go back to the past]

1466
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,510
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I will win it for sure.

1467
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,170
[Go back to the past using your instinct!]

1468
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,510
[Cuckoo!]

1469
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,390
[Nothing could appease time.]

1470
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
[The heroes from the past
pretend they're strong]

1471
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,160
[but they've turned out to be losers..]

1472
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,140
I'm all wet!
[The racing has to continue!]

1473
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,680
They're so fast!

1474
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:04,600
[An exciting time travel,
how will it end?]

1475
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,260
[Next week, 'Dashing Through Time']
