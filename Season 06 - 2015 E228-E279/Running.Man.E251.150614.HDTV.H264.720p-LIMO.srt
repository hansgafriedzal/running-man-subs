00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,550
['K' Golf Course in Gyeonggi Province.]

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,400
<i>Today, it's a couple race.</i>

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,200
A couple race?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,890
[They're highly motivated
from the beginning.]

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,400
- Is it an idol special?
- This day has come again!

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,980
[Six male members,
six gift boxes.]

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,490
Six beautifully wrapped gift boxes

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,610
are waiting for you.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,400
Your wrists are attached
to the strings, right?

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,580
I will call a name

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,200
and another person will appear
as they lift their hand up.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,150
Those two are a team.

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,200
We will start with our lover boy, Gary.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,180
- Oh!
- What is it?

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,580
- This is making me really nervous.
- Is it Ji Hyo?

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,150
- Who will it be?
- It must be Ji Hyo!

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,980
Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,690
- It's not Ji Hyo!
- It's been a while.

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,380
Please reveal Gary's partner!

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,030
[Hand lift.]

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,550
- Hi!
- It's Ji Hyo!

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,230
[He drew Blank Ji.]

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,860
[Congratulations, it's Monday Couple!]

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,750
- It's Blank Ji Hyo.
- I should be happy about it.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,060
It's Ji Hyo!

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,660
I'm slightly nervous to be
partnered with Gary for a while.

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,690
- Are you nervous?
- Your heart's fluttering?

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,380
Ji Hyo even put on perfume!

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,720
Hold hands so we don't get
confused with the non-couples.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,780
- This is nothing.
- Please show us today!

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,320
- Can we lock hands?
- He wants to lock hands.

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,720
It's a habit.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,090
Next is Ha Ha.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,580
[The big reveal!]

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,400
Please reveal Ha Ha's partner!

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,350
[Everyone's talking about
couples and lovers.]

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,030
[The definition of couple is...]

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,720
Honey!

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,980
[Ha Ha's wife, Byul.]

40
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,090
Honey!

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,690
[The first time hearing
'honey' on Running Man.]

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,460
[Everyone's shocked.]

43
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,260
[Were you surprised?]

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,200
Is Jae Suk's wife coming, too?

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,890
What are you saying?

46
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,460
- Hello!
- Hi, Byul!

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,180
- Hello!
- This is a first!

48
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,000
This is a little awkward.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
- You don't seem happy.
- No, no.

50
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,890
- What are you doing?
- Why are you so shy?

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,320
I'm really shy, too.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,580
Ha Ha can't do anything today.

53
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,690
He can't do much.

54
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,800
She's visiting her husband's workplace.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,380
Do you know what he said to me
when Ha Ha's wife appeared?

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,950
- He looks nervous.
- No.

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,400
'That really sucks for him.'

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,800
She hasn't had an outing in a while.

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,520
What if your wife comes?

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,000
Is his wife coming today?

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,460
- That's impossible.
- Ryu Su Jung.

62
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,060
I didn't know Byul was coming today.

63
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,060
I will show you what a real couple is.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,580
Are these all real couples?

65
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,060
Next is Yoo Jae Suk.

66
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,780
Na Kyung Eun!
Na Kyung Eun!

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,720
- Na Kyung Eun might come.
- Kyung Eun.

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,630
No way.

69
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,380
After the helicopter passes.

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,350
- She might come.
- Is she on the helicopter?

71
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,860
Who is it?
I'm really curious.

72
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,720
If Byul came today...
you never know.

73
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,350
Please reveal...
Yoo Jae Suk's partner!

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,200
[Did she really... come?]

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,550
Please reveal
Yoo Jae Suk's partner!

76
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm so curious.
[Lift.]

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,580
[What the heck?]

78
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,630
- Really?
- For real?

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,000
[Puzzled]

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,290
Me?

81
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,780
- Me and him?
- Me?

82
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,120
Me?
Me?

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,350
[Bravo.]

84
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,380
- Nice!
- Me?

85
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,780
What are you doing?
[Is this real?]

86
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,920
[Be happy together.]

87
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,430
- It's 'Love and War.'
- It fits perfectly.

88
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,290
We can't do a couple race together!

89
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,780
Suk Jin!
We're good to go!

90
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,400
There are a lot of boxes left!

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,630
- Come here Kwang Soo.
- This is crazy.

92
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,430
- Is it the easy brothers today?
- Go over there!

93
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,350
- There are still some left.
- Come this way.

94
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,060
- Don't tell me what to do!
- Come here!

95
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,320
[Let's be happy, Honey.]

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,750
What are you doing
with Jong Kook and I?

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,460
- I have a bad feeling.
- Ryu Su Jung!

98
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,150
- Ryu Su Jung!
- No.

99
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,400
[It can't happen...]

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,030
Please reveal Ji Suk Jin's partner!

101
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,580
[Big-nose Couple Reveal!]

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,550
His arm is going up!
Don't put pressure on it!

103
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,860
- I saw it, don't resist!
- It already went up a lot.

104
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,800
No, not at all.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,480
This is disappointing!

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,430
[Big-nose and Giraffe couple.]

107
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,780
There are so many boxes left!

108
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,290
- There are four boxes left!
- But why?

109
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,630
[Huh?]

110
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,320
[Two people at once?]

111
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,520
[Another real couple's entrance.]

112
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,260
[Wow.]
It's Son Jun Ho!

113
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,860
[Musical Prince Son Jun Ho.]

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,660
[Super diva and Alpha Mom,
Kim So Hyun.]

115
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,780
- Hello!
- Welcome!

116
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,080
You're a real couple!
Where's Ju An?

117
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,620
[They met as a couple in
'Phantom of the Opera']

118
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,020
[and became a real couple.]

119
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,920
[They are masters at both
child-rearing and love!]

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,880
<i>Let's give our guests some applause!</i>

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,260
[They were on 'Oh My Baby'
and now they're on Running Man!]

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,000
You're both handsome and beautiful.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Isn't your father a doctor?

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
[Shocked at the sudden question.]

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
- What did you ask?
- Isn't her father a doctor?

126
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,290
- And you're older than him, right?
- Yes.

127
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,380
- What are you saying?
- I just said what I knew.

128
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,780
These are the couples.

129
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,520
First, the official Monday couple...
Gary and Ji Hyo.

130
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,230
Korea's 'Brangelina' Ha Ha and Byul.

131
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,620
[Bran... what?]

132
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,980
Why are there so many Brangelinas?

133
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,780
[We never said anything...]

134
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,060
Forever in a love-hate relationship,
Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

135
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,820
- It's a couple race today!
- Don't complain!

136
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,520
- I don't like it either.
- Just focus on the game today!

137
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't talk, play the game and leave!

138
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,690
Somewhere between alliance and betrayal,
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo.

139
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,950
- We were never attracted to each other!
- No.

140
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,350
Lastly, we have the musical star couple,
Son Jun Ho and Kim So Hyun.

141
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,750
Today, the race is called

142
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,580
'The Love and War Race.'

143
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,920
- We're just war!
- We're also war.

144
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,260
[There's already a war.]

145
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,230
- What is it?
- If you see here

146
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,030
There are rings that are
numbered from 1 to 32.

147
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,200
<i>Three teams who have
won the interim missions</i>

148
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,260
<i>will have the chance
to get rid of the rings.</i>

149
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,060
<i>Get as many chances as you can</i>

150
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,260
and the team that gets
rid of the most rings

151
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,180
will do the final mission.

152
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,950
It's good.

153
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,660
[By the way...]

154
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,180
[There are people watching them.]

155
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,690
I'm warmer because I'm wearing black!

156
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,980
I'm hot because of you!

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,260
Don't the couples have to hold hands?

158
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,830
Can I grab him by the collar?

159
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,350
<i>Grab whatever.</i>

160
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,690
[Grab.]

161
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,110
[Let's also grab whatever.]

162
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
We claim war!

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,400
We claim love!

164
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,180
[Although it's blurry,
we can see a handsome figure.]

165
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,030
- I'm feeling a little nervous today.
- Don't lie!

166
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,580
[They are entering the filming set!]

167
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,030
- You're so weird today!
- Coffee delivery!

168
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,720
[Coff... what?]

169
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,520
- Coffee delivery!
- What?

170
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:06,520
[A precious friend who came
to visit with a load of gifts.]

171
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,750
[Song Joong Ki!]

172
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,060
[Is it really Joong Ki?]

173
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,180
[And Jo In Sung!]

174
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,250
[Yahoo!]

175
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,090
[We're lucky today!]

176
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,800
[And finally Im Joo Hwan.]

177
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,000
[A sudden attack of
the three flower boys.]

178
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,920
[Are you Kwang Soo's stylist?]

179
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,520
[Oh my god!]

180
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,660
Joong Ki!

181
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,690
[Joong Ki's sudden visit.]

182
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,290
[In Sung and Ju Hwan
accompanied Joong Ki today.]

183
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,200
[It became a greeting session.]

184
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,290
[I want to go closer.]

185
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,350
He said hi to me.

187
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,230
Go hug him!

188
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,390
[The greeting session
seems to be done...]

189
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,400
[It became a meet and greet.]

190
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,150
[A lucky encounter
thanks to her husband.]

191
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,630
- What are you guys doing?
- When did you get here?

192
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,980
[Greeting the staff as well.]

193
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,350
- Don't do that! He's uncomfortable!
- What's going on today?

194
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,090
[So Hyun got courage.]

195
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,320
Can I just get one photo?

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,630
[She became a teenage girl.]

197
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,460
[All thanks to 'Running Man.']

198
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,180
[Uncomfortable.]

199
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,400
Look at his face!

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,920
[Pretending to be cool about it.]

201
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
She's my wife.

202
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,060
Joong Ki got discharged
from the army last May.

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,180
Give him some applause.

204
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,630
[He's still taking a selfie.]
What are you doing?

205
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,230
- Stop it!
- Okay!

206
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,290
This is my personal life!

207
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,350
Wait!
Why are you all coming here?

208
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,460
She really likes them.

209
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,120
[I want to...]
Take some photos!

210
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,150
[see them up close.]

211
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,290
She liked them more
than her husband for a second.

212
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,550
I'm serious, I saw it!

213
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,890
Coming today was the best decision.

214
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,000
Your body's gotten more muscular!

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,090
- He worked out a lot.
- Joong Ki...

216
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,150
left experiencing all the
difficult stuff at the beginning.

217
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,320
[All the precious memories
with Joong Ki.]

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,750
<i>I was born in '85, the year of the ox.
I'm 26.</i>

219
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,460
[The young boy we knew]

220
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:53,380
[has returned as an actor
to represent Korea.]

221
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,090
You brought him, but only
Kwang Soo became popular!

222
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,430
[The biggest beneficiary, Giraffe.]

223
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,520
I kept thinking of 'Running Man'
while I was in the army.

224
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,230
I came because I wanted to see you guys.

225
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,950
But I don't know if I'm a bother.

226
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,950
- What do you mean bother?
- We missed Joong Ki.

227
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,520
But In Sung and Joo Hwan came as well!

228
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,090
He's my favorite stylist.

229
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,950
[The stylist is more handsome
than the actual celebrity.]

230
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,980
In Sung, why are you
close with Kwang Soo?

231
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,860
He follows me.

232
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,980
[Satisfying.]

233
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,520
- He follows him.
- He has a good personality.

234
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,090
How long has it been, Joo Hwan?

235
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,580
- We met at Jeju Island.
- We went fishing back then.

236
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,600
- Oh, right we went fishing.
- Yeah.

237
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,380
We were eating dinner yesterday.

238
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,950
Joong Ki wanted to say hi
after the discharge

239
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,460
but he didn't have much time
due to his drama and what not.

240
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,920
What do you mean get lost!

241
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,580
I want to hear them
but you keep talking!

242
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,400
[Slap.]

243
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,520
- I got slapped!
- Good job!

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,060
[Why are you being a nuisance?]
Good job, In Sung!

245
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,980
[He did it for everyone.]

246
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,400
Hit me once, too!

247
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Were you this kind of a person?

248
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,690
Anyway, Joong Ki came to say
hi after he got discharged

249
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,120
and he's going to get busier

250
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,550
so he probably wouldn't
have been able to come

251
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,400
but he wanted to say hi
so he came all the way.

252
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,200
And In Sung and Joo Hwan are close
with Joong Ki so they came.

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,060
Thank you so much for coming today.

254
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,550
Give them an applause!

255
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,780
Next time, you should be
on the show as a guest.

256
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,550
No, my schedule's full.

257
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,520
You have nothing to do.

258
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,980
Let's just make a game, right now.

259
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,800
If we were in the water,
I would take his pants off.

260
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,490
[This man!]

261
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,000
Please say something to the audience.

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hello, this is Song Joong Ki.
It's been a while.

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,230
This is like...
my second home.

264
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,750
And it's been a while since
I've seen the staff and directors.

265
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,180
I just came to say hi today

266
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,460
and next time, I'll come with
In Sung since he's not busy.

267
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,750
- We'll just bring In Sung.
- We'll go to his house.

268
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,320
Please kidnap us.

269
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,430
I know his house password.

270
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,830
[All of a sudden!]

271
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,150
Our writer is a fan, so...

272
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,980
[Signing]

273
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,090
[I didn't expect that!]
What's your name?

274
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,290
It's Ji Eun, right?
[He's blocking her for the flower boys.]

275
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,030
[He's the best.]

276
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,400
Here, Ji Eun.
Be happy.

277
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,350
She always asked me for my signature

278
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,750
and I never had the time,
but I finally did it today.

279
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,320
Anyway, let's hear from In Sung.

280
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,780
It's In Sung's turn to say something.

281
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,460
In Sung, please say something.

282
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,950
Hello, nice to meet you.

283
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,290
He's not a person...

284
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,580
I've been on SBS a few times
because of dramas

285
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,580
but it's been a long time
since I was on a variety show

286
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,460
thanks to Joong Ki and Kwang Soo.

287
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,230
I'm grateful that I could come today.

288
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,980
Even if In Sung's schedule
doesn't allow it...

289
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,150
we'll just bring him
when we bring Joong Ki.

290
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,060
I can make him faint for three seconds.

291
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,150
I'm going to call the police.

292
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,230
We should hear from Joo Hwan, too.

293
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,430
Hello, I've been here once and
this is my second time here.

294
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,780
It was a very sudden visit.

295
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,950
The bag really suits you.

296
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,380
What is this bag?

297
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,750
- Coffee and some snacks.
- Really?

298
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,890
- You brought all these?
- When you usually go out

299
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,000
is it the four of you?

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,150
And also Ki Bang.

301
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,780
- Ki Bang, too?
- Oh, we forgot to call Ki Bang!

302
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,720
[It's a secret.]

303
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,690
- Ki Bang will be hurt.
- Ki Bang might get sad.

304
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,690
We'll go on a separate
outing with Ki Bang.

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,520
Thanks so much for coming,
even if it was short.

306
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,980
And since Joong Ki's back,
I hope he can say hello elsewhere, too.

307
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,130
Thanks to In Sung and Joo Hwan again.

308
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,290
Hopefully we can see each other soon.

309
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,630
We'll come get you.

310
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,860
[Race start.]

311
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,260
You never kissed!

312
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,800
How do you know?

313
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,030
[Is it real or fake?]

314
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,430
[A war-like couple race.]

315
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,000
[Thirty two rings in total!]

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,600
[Challenge the final mission
by eliminating the rings!]

317
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,750
How long has it been since
you've been married?

318
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,090
- Almost five years for us.
- Five years?

319
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,920
Almost three years.

320
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,710
If your wife likes another celebrity

321
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,490
do you get jealous?

322
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,290
- I like a lot of celebrities.
- Me? Were you asking me?

323
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,800
Your question's wrong because
you're not married yet.

324
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,550
- What do you mean?
- You can't ask like that!

325
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,290
This single man!

326
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,860
You need love to get jealous.

327
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,460
You can't answer
that question so easily.

328
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Just because there's a camera here,
it doesn't mean

329
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,490
we're done filming.

330
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,720
We're going home together.

331
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,980
Round two starts after that!

332
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,520
- He doesn't know!
- It was my mistake...

333
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,890
But do you get jealous?
I'm curious now.

334
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,090
No, I don't get jealous.

335
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,430
- Do you get jealous?
- No, I don't.

336
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,890
- Really?
- Because they're celebrities.

337
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,750
- Has she ever liked anyone?
- Yeah.

338
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,060
Kyung Eun likes Joong Ki.

339
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,830
- She likes Joong Ki?
- Yeah, she does.

340
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,030
It keeps changing,
but yeah she likes him.

341
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,600
She likes whoever appears on a drama.

342
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,660
Yeah, that's so true.

343
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,600
After you get married the
jealousy goes away, right?

344
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,720
But I think if you married,
you'd be jealous all the time.

345
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,320
I'm not like that!

346
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,830
You're pretty narrow-minded.

347
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,400
- Narrow-minded?
- Narrow-minded!

348
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,230
Who do you like, Jun Ho?

349
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,120
Because So Hyun liked In Sung.

350
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,090
- Girls Generation!
- Yes, I like Girls Generation.

351
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,860
- Who in Girls Generation?
- I like them all.

352
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,060
- Pick one.
- I like...

353
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,120
It's really hard.

354
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,980
He has someone in mind for sure!

355
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,000
He's just saying that he doesn't.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,920
It's for sure!

357
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,460
We're laughing now.

358
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,490
But on the way back,
she's going to ask, 'but who is it?'

359
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,350
with a smile, calmly.

360
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,380
Jun Ho could truthfully answer

361
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,060
but he's going to say,
'But didn't you like In Sung?'

362
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,260
[So accurate.]

363
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,600
- It's so true.
- Of course!

364
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,200
When I'm watching a drama, he tells me
to go inside and stop watching it.

365
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,550
- Really?
- He does that?

366
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,230
[Love and War race, first mission site.]

367
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,550
[What is this?]

368
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,920
[A pugil stick covered
in bubble wrap.]

369
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,720
- What is that?
- It's a good thing we're a team.

370
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,180
What do you mean, good?

371
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,920
What is this?

372
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,690
What are we doing?

373
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,290
- What is all this?
- What are we doing?

374
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,350
Are we fighting with this?

375
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,890
I want to take this home!

376
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,860
[What is happening here...]

377
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,860
<i>This is the first mission,
'The styrofoam love fight.'</i>

378
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,180
<i>One person from each couple goes up</i>

379
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,550
<i>Then, they use the punch stick
to eliminate the other opponent.</i>

380
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,290
Jong Kook's team is at an advantage.

381
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,690
No, I'm injured.

382
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,120
- My ankle hurts.
- Jong Kook's good at everything.

383
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,920
We are at an advantage.

384
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,000
Why aren't you supporting me?

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,180
But we are at an advantage.

386
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,260
You're secretly boasting.

387
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,980
Each person will compete,
then if someone falls

388
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,600
their partner can fight their opponent.

389
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,580
Then you can qualify in the next round.

390
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,980
Can I win today?

391
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,400
I always lose at the last second.

392
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,660
One team will win by default.

393
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,860
I wish it were us...

394
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,290
The choice of the order
will be with a pre-mission.

395
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,860
Locking the hands of love.

396
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,400
You've all probably done it before.

397
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,890
Kim Jong Kook, please come forward.

398
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,630
Lie down on your back.

399
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,120
Yoo Jae Suk, please come forward.

400
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,780
[Unhappy.]

401
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,550
- Oh this?
- Do the airplane.

402
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,630
- Do the airplane, with your feet.
- With my feet?

403
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,260
Should I take my shoes off?

404
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,120
- Keep them on.
- Keep them on? On your stomach?

405
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,490
- Is it okay?
- You should take them off.

406
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,150
You said it was okay!

407
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,120
I have a white shirt.

408
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,600
I laid down on the floor!

409
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,180
[They bicker about everything.]

410
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,580
Even his bandages are tiger patterned!

411
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,690
[Roar.]

412
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,690
It's hot... your feet are hot.

413
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,920
- What?
- Cool your feet down!

414
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,980
Then what do I do?
It's hot!

415
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,630
- Even if it's a female, it's bad.
- They're hot for each other!

416
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,460
I broke up once because of hot feet.

417
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,380
- Jae Suk, lift your legs off the ground.
- Oh I lift them?

418
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,750
<i>You have to balance with your hands.</i>

419
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,480
<i>It's very stable.</i>

420
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
After 30 seconds,
bend your arms like push ups.

421
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,000
You have to bend your legs.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,380
- He likes to work out.
- It's too easy for Jong Kook.

423
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Who is this game designed for?

424
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,120
- We're definitely going to win this.
- For sure.

425
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,720
[It's designed for us,
what are you going to do?]

426
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,380
[Gloomy.]

427
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,450
Let's reverse!

428
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,320
The girl goes on the bottom.

429
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,430
You can do that!

430
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,260
- She's going on the bottom, too!
- What?

431
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,750
How am I going to hold you up?

432
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,430
What are you saying?

433
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,860
[Your humor is... classy.]

434
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,660
He's using honorifics, too.

435
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,460
It's scary.

436
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,030
[Who will be the last team
to win the pre-mission?]

437
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,200
Lower your partner on the first whistle.
Lift them back up on the second one.

438
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,800
Suk Jin, you should do it!

439
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,980
I will, I will!

440
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,550
It's not hard!
How much do you weigh?

441
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,200
Is this the only game you can think of?

442
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Ready, set...

443
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,030
Everyone's ready, right?

444
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,800
Ready, set!

445
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,860
[Locking the hands of love, start!]

446
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,580
[Lift.]

447
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh my goodness...

448
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,690
Did you eat today?

449
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,200
You're like a feather!
So light!

450
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
Very nice!

451
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
Thirty seconds needed to pass.

452
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
You made such a weird game.

453
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
- You made such a weird game.
- Lower.

454
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
[The time of torture.]

455
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,430
Honey!

456
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,350
Honey!!

457
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,290
[The sound that wakes you up, 'honey']

458
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,630
[The men with their women are
showing off their virile beauty.]

459
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,180
[Just feeling heavy
vs. the power of love.]

460
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,950
I did it!

461
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,090
Ji Suk Jin, please lift him up.

462
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,690
- Yes, like that.
- Hey! It hurts!

463
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,890
Just hold it in for a second.

464
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,430
[Illegal parking.]

465
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,230
[Risky couple.]

466
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,030
[I give up.]

467
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,090
[They couldn't stand the pain.]

468
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,320
[The fighting spirit of the couples.]

469
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,780
Honey, I'm sorry!

470
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,490
[Elimination due to his
wife's heavy love.]

471
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,800
Three teams are left.

472
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,460
[Monday couple, real couple survived.]

473
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,150
Ha Ha's a little different today!

474
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,230
[The lifting of a man.]

475
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,460
Can't you see what's going on?

476
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,890
Go easy!

477
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,230
He wants us to go easy.

478
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,750
Ji Hyo, don't laugh!

479
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm getting tired!
[Three minutes passed.]

480
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,860
It's hard to judge right now.

481
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,030
[Number 1, Ha Byul couple.]

482
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,980
[I'm going to try my best
until the last moment.]

483
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,890
[Number 2, Monday couple.]

484
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,150
[I waited five years...
I can wait until we win this...]

485
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,430
[Number 3, Kkuk and Hopper.]

486
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,750
[Although we bicker, together,
we can overcome anything...]

487
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,090
Get off!

488
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,150
[There's no reason to overcome this!]

489
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,030
Agh!
Move!

490
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,200
[He's calm even after a butt attack.]

491
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,320
What are you doing?

492
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,290
Monday couple vs. the real couple.

493
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,260
Gary!
You're a man today!

494
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,550
I can't give up today!

495
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,890
He's a man to Ji Hyo today!

496
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,920
- Gary! I'll treat you to dinner.
- No!

497
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,150
You're fake anyway!

498
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,090
This is a chance for me!

499
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,290
[One man is doing it for his family]

500
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,490
[another one is doing it
to start a family.]

501
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,460
Ha Ha's different because
Byul's here today.

502
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,230
- He's different from usual.
- He's showing us what a man is.

503
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,660
But more than anything...

504
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,750
Jun Ho's probably awkward right now.

505
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,200
I didn't know.

506
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,630
We're not really a couple,
so it doesn't matter.

507
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,430
[The most embarrassing moment.]

508
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,780
Song Ji Hyo!

509
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,260
You can't date even if you win!

510
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,030
You don't know when you'll break up!

511
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,660
[What goes around comes around.]

512
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,030
[Energy up!]

513
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,400
- I'm going all the way today.
- So am I.

514
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,980
[Intense.]

515
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,150
I want to be lying down, too.

516
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,830
- You're awesome.
- It's really hard to judge.

517
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,090
[Will the four years of love...]

518
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,120
[beat the five years of
Gary's one-sided love?]

519
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,950
[Lift up!]

520
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,580
Honey... it came...

521
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,950
[Tremble, tremble.]

522
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,690
Gary, what are you doing this for?

523
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,090
I can't give up!

524
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,380
That fake couple!

525
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,180
That business couple!

526
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,460
Do you know business?

527
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,350
He just wants to film commercials!

528
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,920
Song! Ji!

529
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,550
Hyo!

530
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,120
Kang! Ga!

531
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,600
Ry!

532
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,720
[I like you.]

533
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,180
This is like the actual mission.

534
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,750
This is the real mission for us!

535
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,580
We know Ha Ha really well,
and he looks so cool today.

536
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,780
It's a first to see him like this.

537
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,030
- He usually doesn't try this hard.
- You guys haven't even kissed yet!

538
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,180
Hey!

539
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,030
What do you know?

540
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,230
You never know!

541
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,920
Nice!
Good job.

542
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,180
[Up again.]

543

Let's go!

544
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,150
Starting now, it will be
three times in a row.

545
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:07,150
One, two, three!

546
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,000
Now we will go five times in a row!

547
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,720

- One, two...
- Dream's daddy!

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,520
Three, four!

551
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,400
[Gary and Ji Hyo succeeds!]

552
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,830
[What about Dream's daddy?]

553
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,750

Ha Ha!

555
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,030
You can do it!
Let's go! Let's go!

556
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,800
Oh my gosh.

557
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,060
[I've never been this
fired up about winning...]

558
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,120
[I've never been strong...]

559
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,260
[But I want to be the
strongest in front of you.]

560
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,950
[Because I am the head of the family...]

561
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:16,350
[He did it!]

562
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,550
Honey, not there!

563
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:25,550
Isn't that too long of a break?

564
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,380
Now, we will do it five times.

565
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,430
But the person who
does it first will win.

566
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,290
The one who does it first.
Ready, set!

567
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,320
This will be the final round!

568
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,600

569
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,630
[Ha Ha and Byul won by a millisecond.]

570

[You did well, Dream's dad.]

571
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,980
- Did we win?
- Yes!

572
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,030
Wow, that's amazing.

573
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,180
[Ha Ha... you're different today.]

574
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,030
Ha Ha's a man!

575
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,230
[A father... is always full of
energy in front of his family.]

576
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,030
Usually, when the
husband's a little tired

577
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,150
the wife says 'you can stop now.'

578
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,950
But she kept saying
'think of Dream, you can do it!'

579
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,690
[You've got to keep your men strong.]

580
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,230
That's the difference
between real and fake.

581
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,520
Gary's amazing, too.

582
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,920
[I hope my sincerity reached Ji Hyo.]

583
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,380
[Ha Ha and Byul can
decide the order now.]

584
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,030
Go Byul!

585
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,630
Byul, I love you!

586
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,550

[Mr. Capable...
is good at anything...]

597
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,510

Do it properly, okay?

605
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,150
- It's a cheer, right?
- Of course, it is.

606
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,580
It's not easy to balance.

[But he counterattacks
with a left hook.]

[In par terre position!]

705
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,460
- Wives!
- Honey!

706
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,860
- Dream's Daddy!
- Watch out, honey!

707
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,830
- Honey.
- Dream is watching you!

708
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,230
Are you going to get
scolded if you lose?

709
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,040
I don't want to get married!

710
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,690
This is amazing!

711
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,010
[A man can lose,
but a family head can't!]

712
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,120
Ha Ha wins!

713
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,720
[Jun Ho touched the floor first.]

714
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,750
Are you tied to your wife's aprons?

715
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,950
This is the marriage life!

716
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,590
This is the reality.

717
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,830
[Dream's parents make it to the finals.]

718
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,810
[Jong Kook vs. Ha Ha]

719
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,490
It's not easy to keep your balance.

720
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,350
- Be careful.
- Ha Ha is different today.

721
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,230
[Very charismatic.]

722
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,630
Dong Hun, you look stronger.

723
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,660
It maybe true but...

724
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,520
I think he reached his limit.

725
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,090
[My Partner, Grasshopper!]
I cheer for you, Dong Hun!

726
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,350
I'm just saying people have limit.

727
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,520
[Mr. Capable vs. Dream's father]

728
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,430
[Head shot.]

729
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,460
Wait!

730
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,580
- What?
- His wife is watching!

731
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,150
I was striking a cool pose!

732
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,860
You should start with a jab,
how can you start with an uppercut?

733
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,780
Dong Hun, think about all the
sadness for the past five years!

734
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,630
Oh, no!

735
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,180
Keep talking, honey.

736
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,670

[Should I go easy on him?]

738

[Scattered.]

Oh, my Buddhist rosary!

740
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,000
You're done.
You broke his Buddhist rosary!

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,230
It was his great grandmother's!

742
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,350
It's something you
can't buy with money.

743
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,630
It's a family heirloom!

744
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,860
You shouldn't have touched it!

745
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,440
It's been handed down
for three generations!

746
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,430
And it's broken by Ha Ha!

747
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,520
Jong Kook, you should fight
for your great grand mother.

748

[The enemy of my great grandmother!]

749

This broke!

751
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,950
It became nun-chucks!

752
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,580
The beating stick has a joint now.

753
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,750
It's over.
It's off-balance!

754
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,630
[Let's finish up, Ha Ha...]

755
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,690
Then, just walk over to that side...

756

I can tell how hard his work is.

764
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,660
Be nice to me.

765
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,040
I will, from now on.

766
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,430
[Jong Kook lost to Byul.]

767
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,000

[The finals.]
[Grasshopper vs. Byul]

I'm scared.

771
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,580

- Honey!
- What are you doing?

[What privilege will they have?]

787

there are 32 rings.

789
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,180
Since you're the first winners,
take out ten numbers.

790

eliminate ten numbers.]

- Take it out.
- Can we say it out loud?

793
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,600

- We're the second place winners.
- How many can we pick?

Second place can
eliminate seven numbers.

798

Seven numbers, it's not bad.

799

Are you assisting your husband?

811
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,750
He's always weak on TV.

812
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,600
He's weak, so I couldn't
understand him.

813
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,720
I feel like I'm a
tour guide for couples.

814

- I guess it's from the lake.
- Look at the color.

- <i>This is the moment...</i>
- Just sit down.

[He summed up the situation.]
See?

00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,320
You know what Jun Ho
said during the break?

832
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,980
Did I act too lightly?

833
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,380
I didn't think so.

834

their own show together.

The first one who completes
two rows will make the team win.

851
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,750
The rest of the couples
will get water bombed.

852
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,890
That's harsh!

853
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,290
The category for
the first round is...

854
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,290
'The dating spot I've been to.'

855
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,390
Where do you think he's been to?

856
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,500
He probably didn't have
the chance to date.

857
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,830
What are you talking about?

858

You mean the dating spots
that we've been together?

00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,010
It's only good
for the real couples!

860
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,750
Or with someone else?

861
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,440
Why would you want to do that?

862
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,320
- Can we talk to each other?
- No, you can't.

863
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,120
Honey, come to your senses!

864
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,890

- You're the only one?
- Do any of you have it?

874
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,780
[No one has it.]
Is it good if no one else has it?

875
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,230
Why would you go to a night club
when you date?

876
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,750
Who would date at a club?

877

Have you gone to

- No.

880
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,690
- I went there on a date.
- Because you performed together?

881
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,640
- No.
- Oh, to perform together?

882
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,290
I went there with my date
when I was in high school.

883
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,920
- My girlfriend in high school.
- You were a high school student?

884
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,580
That's illegal!

885
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,350
Can't we arrest him now?

886
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,520
It's Byul's turn.

887
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,630
I don't think anyone has it.

888
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,380
A postnatal care center!

889
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,630
[Ha Ha doesn't have it.]

890
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,380
What is that?

891
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:19,240
[No one else has it.]

892
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,750
- Nice, you're the only one.
- We had a good time there.

893
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,600
I have good memories.

894
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,230
You call it a date?

895
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,550
It's pretty nice.
I recommend it.

896
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,800
It's my turn, right?

897
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,980
Yes, I can see how much
you hate being water bombed.

898
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,500
The dating spot I've been to...

899
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,030
you know before we got married

900
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,350
Spicy rice cake place!

901
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,600
I don't have it.

902
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,860
What do we do, isn't that too specific?

903
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,810
- Snack bar?
- Restaurant?

904
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,750
Restaurant should be fine.

905
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,950
Didn't you hear the rules?

906
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,630
You're not supposed to
write anywhere too specific.

907
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,210
- How can you not write 'restaurant'?
- I couldn't think of it.

908
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,120
Why didn't you write it, honey?

909
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,920
It's Jun Ho's turn.

910
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,890
'The dating spot I've been to' is...

911
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,980
church!

912
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,690
[So Hyun has church, too.]

913
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,890
[The rest are silent.]

914
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,250
At a church?

915
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,180
So Hyun kissed me at
the church for the first time.

916
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,800
- Really?
- At that holy place?

917
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,210
I did it too, with
a daughter of a pastor!

918
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,290
Gary, what are you talking about?

919
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,290
That was my first kiss!

920
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,260
At her church?

921
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,430
Jun Ho, you said So Hyun kissed you?

922
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,780
We were talking in the car
at the parking lot of the church.

923
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,490
In the car, then all of a sudden...

924
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,240
At the time, I kept saying I liked her,
but she didn't accept me.

925
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,380
I said I like her again,
then all of a sudden...

926
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,980
- Oh, no!
- Really?

927
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,150
[Why are you talking about this?]

928
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,350
Why did you change your mind?

929
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,610
It's not that I kissed him but...

930
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,750
He kept hinting?

931
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,580
I tried to avoid him,
but it was the wrong direction.

932
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,780
- You couldn't resist.
- No, I avoided in the wrong direction.

933
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,400
She tried to resist, but couldn't.

934
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,260
<i>God, please allow me!</i>

935
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,290
Oh, So Hyun!

936
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,860
Wow, he's good.

937
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,030
He's good.

938
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,220
He's a rising star.

939
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,630
[He's a new variety star
at 33 years old.]

940
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,520
It's Gary's turn.

941
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,980
'The dating spot I've been to' is...

942
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,400
I'm sure Ji Hyo has it.

943
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,200
- Han River!
- Okay!

944
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,320
Han River!

945
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,290
[Ji Hyo doesn't have it.]
Isn't river enough?

946
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,350
You don't have it?

947
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:06,580
- Just river is okay?
- But the Han River is different.

948
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,010
Han River and just river
are totally different things.

949
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,720
I'll accept any river for this one.

950
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,620
- Yes!
- Han River has cruise.

951
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,860
Han River is one of
the mandatory places.

952
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,150
Some people camp close to Han River.

953
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,320
Did any of you go to Han River...

954
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,100
and see other celebrities on a date?

955
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,550
- I have.
- Me too.

956
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,550
Honestly, I have, about three times.

957
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,260
I went easy on them.

958
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,600
I've only stayed in the car.

959
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,400
- Why?
- You're nasty!

960
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,980
I was just listening to music
while watching the river.

961
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,980
I've seen you.

962
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,120
- Should I say it?
- Say it.

963
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,550
Should I say it in front of your wife?

964
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,350
What are you doing?

965
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,920
Tell me.

966
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,000
I was just joking.

967
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,980
'The dating spot I've been to' is...

968
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,800
I hope he doesn't say an
old place like Gyeongbok Palace.

969
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,610
Old palace.

970
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,120
He actually said it.

971
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,550
[Careful for what you wish for.]

972
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,980
[No one has it.]

973
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,460
I'm the only one, right?

974
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,810
I never knew.
Did you really go there?

975
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,380
- Yes, I did.
- Actually, it's really nice.

976
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,660
It's really nice at night.

977
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,630
My blind date was at Changgyeong Palace.

978
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,580
The cherry blossoms at
Changgyeong Palace are wonderful.

979
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,980
It's So Hyun's turn.

980
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,270
'The dating spot I've been to' is...

981
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,200
My husband´s grandfather's house!

982
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,490
[Her husband doesn't have it...]

983
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,780
[who else might have it?]

984
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,890
Your answers never match.

985
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,690
I'm sorry, honey.

986
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,430
The day before our wedding photo shoot

987
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:06,550
we went to my husband's
grandfather's house and took a walk.

988
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,550
Did you kiss there again?

989
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,150
We're always passionate.

990
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,400
They are lovebirds.

991
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,920
He's boastful.

992
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,830
[Embarrassed.]

993
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,430
You told me to do my best...

994
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,090
I'm sorry, I'll be careful.

995
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:31,040
No, I have to tease you for the show.

996
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,270
- Just keep trying.
- I understand.

997
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,270
So Hyun thinks Jun Ho is cute.

998
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,060
Next, it's Jong Kook's turn.

999
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,290
Jong Kook, call whatever you want.

1000
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:50,550
- It's not 'my house', right?
- This might be common for celebrities.

1001
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,520
One, two, three!

1002
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,030
Practice room!

1003
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,180
I knew it, because
they're musical singers.

1004
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,660
[But your partner doesn't have it.]

1005
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,150
Practice room?

1006
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,460
Is karaoke included?

1007
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,290
[He's cute.]

1008
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,830
Were you dating a celebrity?

1009
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,580
When I was in Turbo.

1010
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,830
I know who she is.

1011
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,630
I know who his date was.

1012
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,720
Shut up.

1013
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,490
Then, she must be a singer.

1014
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:32,040
No, she wasn't.
She's not a singer.

1015
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,780
Why would you practice
together if she's not a singer?

1016
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,780
She just visited my practice room.

1017
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,640
I stayed at the practice room
most of the time.

1018
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,800
It's Ha Ha's turn.

1019
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,920
I think everyone has this.

1020
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,000
Just say it.

1021
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,090
[Worried.]

1022
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,720
- Anything is fine, Honey.
- Namsan!

1023
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,690
- A mountain?
- Namsan!

1024
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,720
- Is mountain okay?
- Han River included all rivers.

1025
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,430
Any mountains?

1026
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,120
[One row is done.]

1027
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,060
How about 'mountain road'?

1028
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,800
Mountain.

1029
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,980
I don't have it.

1030
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,920
- I climbed up a mountain once.
- Which mountain?

1031
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,580
- Chunggye mountain.
- Together?

1032
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:29,490
- Yes.
- I went jogging at 2 a.m. once.

1033
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,350
- Which mountain?
- Namsan.

1034
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,690
Oh, at Namsan mountain?

1035
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,600
It's my turn.

1036
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,400
Are you ready?

1037
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,690
Give us a good one.

1038
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:38,940
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1039
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,040
Convenience store.

1040
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,630
- How about 'supermarket'?
- No.

1041
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,350
[Only Jun Ho has it.]

1042
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,070
How could you go on a date
at a convenience store?

1043
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,520
It doesn't make any sense!

1044
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,660
It was really out of the way.

1045
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,580
I'm serious.

1046
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,090
- It was a tiny store.
- They had chairs?

1047
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,000
The guy didn't recognize us.

1048
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,980
We could talk for a while.

1049
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,780
- I've done it.
- Convenience store.

1050
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,750
- Are you talking about your wife?
- Yes.

1051
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,430
- And the Chunggye mountain, too?
- Yes, that was with my wife.

1052
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:20,500
- He can't talk about other women.
- Of course not.

1053
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,210
You're going too far.

1054
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,350
['Talk Bingo' is dangerous.]

1055
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,320
[Only one more to go.]

1056
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,720
That's good.

1057
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,320
[It's Jong Kook's turn.]

1058
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,890
'The dating spot I've been to' is...

1059
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,920
How have you been?

1060
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,660
The U.S.!
[He finishes two diagonals.]

1061
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,340
The US?

1062
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,030
[The water bomb goes off.]

1063
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,510
Oh no!

1064
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,180
[Splash!]

1065
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,270
[The powerful water bomb
washes away the summer heat.]

1066
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,630
[These two stay dry.]

1067
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:12,180
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook come in first.]

1068
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,060
You're amazing.

1069
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,410
[He must train the
muscles in his brain.]

1070
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,460
- So fast?
- How did he make it so fast?

1071
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,270
- That couple is amazing.
- You need to meet a good partner.

1072
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,800
That's right.

1073
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,060
[Their improvised song and dance.]

1074
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,690
That's why you call him Mr. Capable.

1075
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,580
The topic for the second round is

1076
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,660
'Disappointing gifts you've received.'

1077
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,690
Honey, just include the ones
you received before you met me.

1078
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,410
I don't care, okay?
Let's just win.

1079
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,550
You need to write the gifts that
you actually received and be specific.

1080
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:53,230
['The gift that disappointed you.']

1081
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,410
[The finished boards.]

1082
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,350
['Talk Bingo', second round begins.]

1083
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,980
I...

1084
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,810
think many of you have this.

1085
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,350
- No, don't call it.
- If it's in a good position.

1086
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,000
It's in a good position.

1087
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,690
If it's too common,
sometimes people forget.

1088
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,040
It's better to wait,
because other people might say it.

1089
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,630
- What do you want me to do?
- Just call it.

1090
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,230
- We don't really get along.
- Isn't that weird?

1091
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,950
[But they placed first.]

1092
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,800
Then I'll call this one.

1093
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,720
I think many people wrote this.

1094
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,580
A bad gift that made me feel crappy...

1095
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,400
Crappy?

1096
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,860
That made me feel bad... is

1097
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,230
- a letter!
- Great!

1098
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,030
[Ha Ha has it.]

1099
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,150
[As she expected, a few people have it.]

1100
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,380
- It's common.
- A letter, why?

1101
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,950
Do postcards count?

1102
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,920
How about diary exchanges?

1103
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,630
In fact, I...

1104
00:56:54,630 --> 00:57:00,350
and other women have
a romantic image about snail mails.

1105
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,030
When Ha Ha wrote me a letter...

1106
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,810
on my birthday

1107
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,650
he asked me what I
wanted for my birthday

1108
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,490
and I said nothing else but a letter.

1109
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,520
So he wrote me a letter.

1110
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,580
But he wrote me a swear word.

1111
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,320
- Huh?
- Why did I do that?

1112
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,520
Some of you already
know that Ha Ha...

1113
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,150
is loving and caring,
but too shy to express it.

1114
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,720
He's too embarrassed
to express himself romantically.

1115
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,090
He wrote
'Happy birthday.'

1116
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,240
'Sorry for not being
able to be with you.'

1117
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,580
'I love you.'
Then he wrote a swear word.

1118
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,690
- I know what you're talking about.
- He's a macho man.

1119
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,310
It was right before the marriage.

1120
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,550
- I'm sorry.
- I thought I saw it wrong.

1121
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,550
That's great.

1122
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,580
On your tenth anniversary,
you should read it back to him

1123
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,890
in his ears.

1124
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,210
Next is So Hyun's turn.

1125
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,100
A credit card with a lowered limit.

1126
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,630
You didn't like that credit card?

1127
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,010
How much was the limit?

1128
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,000
It was when we just started dating.

1129
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,240
He made a credit card and gave it to me.

1130
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,490
He told me to use it all I want
and I was really happy.

1131
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,400
It means he thinks of me
more than just a girlfriend.

1132
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,650
He thinks of you as a family.

1133
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,230
I was so happy that I
couldn't use the credit card.

1134
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,350
Later, I found out about the
credit limit and it surprised me.

1135
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,660
Was it because the limit was too little?

1136
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,150
No, it's because it's really
impressive when you receive it.

1137
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,320
But when you find out about the limit,
it feels like a betrayal.

1138
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,150
It feels like that's how
much he can trust me.

1139
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,270
She wasn't going to
go over the limit at all...

1140
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,200
Let me explain.

1141
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,750
- Was it a joke?
- No, I met her at my debut musical.

1142
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,980
I was a student right before the time.

1143
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,670
Three hundred thousand won
was all I had and I gave her that.

1144
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,000
- He gave his everything.
- But he made a credit card for her.

1145
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,750
He didn't have much
but he still did it.

1146
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,350
I still have the note he
put on the credit card.

1147
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,730
What did he write?

1148
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,550
Put away your credit card,
and use this card.

1149
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,630
He's romantic.

1150
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,200
He was going to increase the limit then!

1151
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,750
I hate it the most.

1152
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,630
This romantic situation,
I really don't know what to do.

1153
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:30,290
I can't stand it when a
romantic scene comes on TV.

1154
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:34,260
- I like it.
- Are you trying to become like Sean?

1155
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,200
Sean or Cha In Pyo?

1156
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,890
That's amazing.
He's amazing.

1157
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,890
Son Jun Ho is the new model husband now.

1158
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,240
- The title moves.
- I'm not romantic.

1159
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,780
He cursed...

1160
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,800
It's Ji Suk Jin.

1161
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:55,430
One of the most disappointing
gifts I received was...

1162
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,120
a bamboo wife!
(A long bamboo bolster)

1163
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,500
A bamboo wife!

1164
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,750
[After the 'old palace, '
no one else wrote it.]

1165
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,270
If you want to use a bamboo wife,
make sure to wear your pj's.

1166
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:15,100
- Did you get marks?
- It's not smooth.

1167
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,890
- Don't they leave marks?
- Yes.

1168
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,830
Next is Ji Hyo.

1169
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,240
A gift that I don't
want to receive is...

1170
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,580
a song.

1171
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,950
- A song?
- A love song?

1172
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,750
- Are you talking to Gary?
- A song recorded on a cassette tape!

1173
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,980
- That counts, too.
- Yes.

1174
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,290
Oh, when a guy sings
while looking at your eyes?

1175
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:45,270
<i>What should I do?
I fell in love with her.</i>

1176
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,580
<i>Where are you?
What are you doing?</i>

1177
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,180
<i>I love you.</i>

1178
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,810
<i>Please let me love you.</i>

1179
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,030
[She can't stand it.]

1180
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,090
<i>Ji Hyo is so pretty.</i>

1181
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,980
[Putting her name in
the song is the worst.]

1182
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,840
<i>Ji Hyo is my woman.</i>

1183
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,800
<i>- Hyo...
- Stop it!</i>

1184
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,460
It's unctuous!

1185
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,490
Stop it!

1186
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:18,260
How about you?
Do you sing to each other?

1187
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,580
I haven't, but Jun Ho did.

1188
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,720
I sang many times.
I played piano and sang for her.

1189
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,430
- What did you sing?
- Ji Hyo hates it.

1190
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,920
At home, she was upset because of me.

1191
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,350
So, I casually started to sing...

1192
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,460
<i>I'm the only man to you.</i>

1193
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,320
Excuse me, you do that at home?

1194
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,150
- You do it at home?
- How does your wife react?

1195
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,580
I think she might start singing too.

1196
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,800
I actually like this kind of stuff.

1197
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,090
He says romantic stuff.

1198
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:56,780
- What does he say?
- You know, when I'm upset...

1199
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,230
[What could it be?]

1200
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,210
When she's sullen, I say,
'Please look at me.'

1201
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:07,810
'I know you have a
beautiful profile, but still...'

1202
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,090
- That's not too bad.
- But he's not shallow.

1203
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,750
He's very romantic.

1204
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,750
He actually uses the lines from a drama.

1205
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,520
- They're a match made in heaven.
- That's right.

1206
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,240
It's almost done.

1207
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,520
Let's just play until
we have the third place.

1208
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,070
One of the gifts that I don't want is...

1209
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,150
- flower!
- I knew it.

1210
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,060
- I made it!
- You did?

1211
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,290
- Song Ji Hyo!
- They've got the second place.

1212
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,070
[Ji Hyo and Gary placed the second.]

1213
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,870
You still have a chance for third place.

1214
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,230
Third place.

1215
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,830
Honey, are you okay?

1216
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,870
You need to meet a good partner.

1217
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:57,000
By the way, I thought
women like flowers.

1218
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,440
Women don't like flowers,
don't give them something like that.

1219
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,550
They like it if you give her
a big bunch of Baby's breath

1220
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,890
when they're with all their girlfriends.

1221
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,920
Why don't you do it?

1222
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,380
Just do it!

1223
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,890
You always hold dumbbells, not flowers.

1224
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:18,780
Next is Lee Kwang Soo.

1225
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,750
Kwang Soo, just call one
more item for me.

1226
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:31,980
[What will be Kwang Soo's word?]

1227
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,780
A purple sock!

1228
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,060
Socks!

1229
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,820
Okay!

1230
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,360
Socks!

1231
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,460
- Who has it?
- Me!

1232
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,320
I have it, too.
[She completes two lines.]

1233
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,870
Socks!
I made it!

1234
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,580
Ha Ha and Byul made it to third place!

1235
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,100
Thank you, Kwang Soo!

1236
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,120
[The rest of the couples
gets the water bomb again.]

1237
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,950
It's so cold!

1238
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,750
Thank you, Kwang Soo!

1239
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,720
Thank you for your work!

1240
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,870
[The second mission is over.]

1241
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,520
The couple who placed first,
please come forward.

1242
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,780
- Jong Kook!
- Yes.

1243
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:33,260
- The first place.
- Let's pick this one.

1244
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,720
Another one.
Three.

1245
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,810
[They have eliminated 15 rings so far.]

1246
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,320
Pick the numbers, Gary.
[They get to eliminate seven numbers.]

1247
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,180
[They are being careful.]

1248
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,750
[They have 25 rings left.]

1249
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:57,090
Third place can
eliminate five numbers.

1250
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:00,890
- So Hyun, did you win?
- We placed third once.

1251
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,260
[17 rings left,
chasing after the first team.]

1252
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,180
[Their crazy mode didn't stop here.]

1253
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:10,240
<i>Your third mission is
'The couples name tag war.'</i>

1254
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,230
<i>Find the key of love and
unlock your handcuffs.</i>

1255
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:18,890
<i>As soon as you unlock them</i>

1256
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,950
<i>you can eliminate other
couples' name tags.</i>

1257
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,670
<i>Unless you unlock the handcuffs,
you can't attack.</i>

1258
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,290
<i>You will have to run away from others.</i>

1259
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,980
These handcuffs are such obstacles.

1260
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,320
[Even after Ha Ha was eliminated]

1261
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,860
[She was hiding and ousted Kwang Soo!]

1262
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,290
How do you feel being
betrayed, Kwang Soo?

1263
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,180
[Thanks to Ha Ha's competitive wife,
they placed second.]

1264
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,610
[A total of 22 rings were eliminated!]

1265
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,980
[Ha Ha was in a crazy mode
from the beginning.]

1266
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,810
[He won the pre-game.]

1267
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:56,320
[Then his wife Byul
kept winning the first game.]

1268
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,890
This is a chance!

1269
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:06,640
[They eliminated ten rings!]

1270
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,010
[During the second mission...]

1271
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,380
[they worked in perfect harmony]

1272
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,830
[and made it to third place again.]

1273
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:19,350
[They eliminated five more rings.]

1274
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,350
[And won second place at the last game.]

1275
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,660
<i>Ha Ha and Byul, please come forward.</i>

1276
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,860
In the beginning, I announced that only
the first winner can enter the finals.

1277
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,240
Ha Ha and Byul qualified
for the final mission.

1278
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,380
The last team
for the final mission.

1279
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,690
[32-story condo in Sungnam]

1280
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,120
Go Eun, you will be doing it first.

1281
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,890
Did you think you would win today?

1282
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,950
What is it?

1283
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,780
- Oh my god.
- They covered my eyes again.

1284
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:57,830
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

1285
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,120
Why do they have to do this?

1286
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,320
[32 numbers and 32 story building.
What kind of a mission will it be?]

1287
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,180
[Five people on the 15th floor.]
What is it?

1288
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,410
[Five people on the 16th floor.]

1289
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,380
What is it?

1290
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,060
[Cameras are installed
from the 1st to 32nd floor.]

1291
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,660
- What are those?
- What's going on?

1292
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,000
[What are the cameras for?]

1293
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,570
<i>The final mission is...</i>

1294
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:33,400
'The Telepathy Elevator.'

1295
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:39,690
Like I said, only the first winner
can challenge the final mission.

1296
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,270
Ha Ha and Byul can challenge
the final mission.

1297
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:48,010
<i>The couple has to pick a number
out of all the numbers they have.</i>

1298
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:51,150
<i>- One number.
- Just one?</i>

1299
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,800
Each of you

1300
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,240
will take a different elevator and
go to the floor of your choice.

1301
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,270
You will win if you can
communicate telepathically

1302
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:05,290
and meet each other on the same floor.

1303
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:09,860
That's why it's better
to have less numbers.

1304
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,950
- Do they have only one chance to try?
- Yes.

1305
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:16,550
- How is it possible?
- I have a few numbers on my mind.

1306
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,690
Anyway, you have ten numbers now.

1307
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,060
This is a lot easier
for the real couples.

1308
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,230
That's right.

1309
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:26,230
- It's not that easy.
- They can pick a special number.

1310
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,870
I thought I had to memorize
all the numbers.

1311
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,800
We all thought so at first.

1312
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,550
Just in case, we kept
more than five special numbers.

1313
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,430
More than five?

1314
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,090
Her birthday, my birthday...

1315
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,060
our anniversary

1316
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,690
and my son's birthday.

1317
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:52,350
Ha Ha will pick a number
and go to that floor.

1318
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:55,830
You will go to the lobby and choose.

1319
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,830
Then go to that floor.

1320
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,780
Good luck!

1321
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:02,520
- You never know.
- Good luck!

1322
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,470
Ha Ha left a few special numbers,
I hope he picks the right one.

1323
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:08,850
It's easier that they
have an anniversary date.

1324
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,230
Yes, it is.

1325
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,950
I think it's possible.

1326
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,690
[Will they be able to
read each other's mind?]

1327
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,800
Good luck!

1328
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,320
- Isn't that the song?
- I think so, too.

1329
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,100
- I hope it's what I'm thinking.
- December?

1330
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,690
- That should be the date.
- It's the date.

1331
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:32,800
I think they will play
'Mai piu cosi lontano.'

1332
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,920
They can do it.

1333
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,470
Because they're married...
[Out of ten numbers...]

1334
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:42,600
[But there's only one answer
for the two hearts!]

1335
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,920
[Nervous, anxious, and burdensome.]
This drives me nuts.

1336
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,140
[They came to pick a number.]

1337
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:55,550
[The same location,
but different times.]

1338
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:59,320
But the possibility went up.

1339
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,800
Let's see.

1340
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,890
Number 20.

1341
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:07,200
This is my birthday.

1342
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,180
August 20th.

1343
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:14,780
Ha Ha's birthday is August 20th.

1344
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,920
Number 22.

1345
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:24,030
Byul was born in October 22nd in 1983.

1346
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:28,660
My birthday is October 22nd.

1347
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,640
And...

1348
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:36,950
30 is our wedding anniversary.

1349
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:43,150
The last number is
our wedding anniversary, 30th.

1350
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,430
<i>You know the story</i>

1351
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:49,860
about the couple
who crossed dramatically.

1352
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:55,200
On Christmas day,
the wife cuts and sells her hair....

1353
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,120
and buys a wristband for her husband.

1354
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,690
Her husband sells his watch
to buy his wife a comb.

1355
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:08,120
It's a beautiful story,
but we might do the same.

1356
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,040
If we go to the floors for
each other's birthday...

1357
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:17,950
If I pick my husband's birthday

1358
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:21,230
and he picks my birthday...

1359
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:24,860
then we will fail.

1360
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,090
After what we've done
today to win this race...

1361
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,030
[The couple's last crisis...]

1362
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,750
I've decided.

1363
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:38,200
Go Eun, I'm trying to communicate
with you telepathically.

1364
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,180
I hope you heard me.

1365
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,380
Honey...

1366
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,490
I need to speak through telepathy.

1367
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,890
[Can you hear my mind?]

1368
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,260
[I think he might have
picked this number.]

1369
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,580
I think they will succeed.

1370
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,610
I think so and I hope so.

1371
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,350
What number did you eliminate?

1372
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,550
I only got rid of five numbers.

1373
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,640
- We took out random numbers.
- Me too.

1374
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,580
We just got rid of one to five.

1375
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,060
Because we didn't think about it.

1376
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,580
- So I think we would win if I picked 6.
- I thought about it, too.

1377
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,780
No, Suk Jin might pick 'lucky seven!'

1378
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,980
[No way...]

1379
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,000
Seven?

1380
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,350
Seven?
[He is very predictable.]

1381
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:29,090
But you stopped at five,
so Kwang Soo would pick six.

1382
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,920
I'd pick 31.

1383
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,120
- Is it a special day?
- No, it's a random number.

1384
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,320
I think it's a special day.

1385
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,980
What day is it?

1386
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,000
What number would you pick?

1387
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,490
- I... would pick 31.
- Why?

1388
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,520
So Hyun told me by telepathy.

1389
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,520
- For real.
- That she picked 31?

1390
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,660
[Ha Ha is on the way to the elevator.]
This is crazy.

1391
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,950
He's on the elevator.

1392
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,200
He's going.

1393
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,150
I really hope they will meet.

1394
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,630
I'm nervous.

1395
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,600
<i>This is the moment...</i>

1396
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,580
<i>This is the day.</i>

1397
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:17,120
- Wow, this is...
- Very nervous.

1398
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,430
[This moment...]

1399
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:23,630
[Go Eun, see you up there!]

1400
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,270
<i>I hope Ha Ha meets Byul, really.</i>

1401
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,030
I have only one chance, right?

1402
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,720
[They have only one chance.]

1403
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,060
<i>Ha Ha picks the floor now?</i>

1404
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,230
[They have to pick the same number.]

1405
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:42,660
My heart is pounding.
It's very romantic.

1406
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,860
[Ha Ha gets off the elevator.]

1407
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,260
He's right there!

1408
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,000
He got off!

1409
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,040
[Kkuk put his hands together.]
How would he feel?

1410
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:01,580
I'm so nervous.
What should I do?

1411
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,520
[After Ha Ha goes up,
Byul takes the elevator.]

1412
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,200
[Sigh.]

1413
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,780
I can't watch.

1414
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,290
[Blank Ji and So Hyun's
hearts are fluttering.]

1415
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:17,010
- What would Ha Ha be thinking?
- She went up!

1416
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:19,150
She's coming, she's coming!

1417
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,400
The second floor...

1418
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,460
She's coming, coming, coming!
What should I do?

1419
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:29,260
This is a bit touching...

1420
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,460
It is touching.

1421
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,200
It's moving.

1422
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,030
- If it takes a while.
- She's still going up.

1423
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,350
- She's going up pretty high.
- I think they will meet.

1424
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,690
[I hope my heart was conveyed to you.]

1425
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,860
[Do you remember the day of
our marriage registration?]

1426
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,460
[I proposed to you at the city hall.]

1427
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:57,320
Marry me.
Please be my last love.

1428
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,860
[They started their second
life as a couple.]

1429
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:05,640
[And they had to face
the telepathy elevator.]

1430
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,060
- His birthday.
- Her birthday.

1431
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,900
The 30th is our wedding anniversary.

1432
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,010
[There might be bumps]

1433
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,900
[and the path might be rough.]

1434
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:30,400
[In the end, if we are together...]

1435
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:36,950
[that is...]

1436
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:41,520
[the love.]

1437
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,150
Honey!

1438
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:46,930
[Ha Ha and Byul read
each other's minds.]

1439
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,920
[Congratulations!]

1440
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:53,900
[It's very touching!]

1441
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:57,580
- I have goose bumps!
- Me too!

1442
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,120
They met!

1443
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,800
[Heartwarming.]

1444
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,860
It feels really nice.

1445
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,210
We lost the race,
but it's a nice ending.

1446
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,270
- It feels weird.
- It is weird!

1447
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,810
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her!

1448
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:19,950
[Hug.]

1449
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,120
[They picked their wedding anniversary.]

1450
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,490
[The miracle of love.]

1451
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:32,410
- My leg were giving out.
- I thought you might go to 22nd floor.

1452
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:35,860
- I...
- We did it!

1453
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,120
[Ha Ha and Byul win the final mission.]

1454
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,920
<i>November 30.</i>

1455
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,890
<i>It's our wedding anniversary.</i>

1456
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:48,320
<i>I picked our wedding anniversary.</i>

1457
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:55,210
[Ha Ha and Byul's love and war
has a happy ending.]

1458
01:16:56,220 --> 01:17:00,150
<i>- I knew that you would pick 2 or 32.
- Jae Suk said you would pick 7.</i>

1459
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,460
[I envy them.]

1460
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:12,000
- Was it your wedding anniversary?
- I almost changed my mind.

1461
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,550
- It was confusing.
- We were worried, too.

1462
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:18,180
This is the prize for the race,
and it happens to be star-shaped.

1463
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,580
I should have won this ring.

1464
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,040
[Gary doesn't give up.]

1465
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:32,690
- That's wonderful.
- It feels so nice!

1466
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,690
Gary said fake couples have limits.

1467
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,780
We were done a long time ago.

1468
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,380
I could see the ending early.

1469
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,430
- Why did you pick 31?
- She doesn't answer.

1470
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:49,550
- What day is it?
- Our first kiss.

1471
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:52,150
[Oh, at the church?]

1472
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,660
They remember the date?
That's amazing!

1473
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,580
[Live happily with Ju An.]
Congratulations!

1474
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,950
[Hope you can always
communicate telepathically!]

1475
