3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,990
We're camping!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,730
It's nice to be outside.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,240
- It's nice out.
- The breeze is nice.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,010
It'll be nice to cook some meat.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,050
Let's pick up some girls!

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,190
This is my outfit today.

sent you a friend request.]

[An SNS friend who joined
in on the vacation!]

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,530
Why are you so late, Sang Woo?

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,930
[Handsome and tall,
Do Sang Woo!]

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,440

It's been a while!

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,410
We need someone like him, that way
people come from the other tents.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,610
In this large area

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,540
there are only two tents.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,210
We'll die of heat!

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,440
A long time ago, we would talk
to the people in the other tents.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,790
Then I'll visit that tent over there.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,670
- Why are you going?
- I'll go.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,270
- Sang Woo should go!
- I'll go!

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,530
- Go Sang Woo.
- Check how many there are.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,270
- Bring something.
- You have to offer them something, I've done this before!

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,240
You have to take expensive fruits.

Knock just in case they're changing.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,410
Okay.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,500
- Get out.
- Yes.

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,530
[Flustered.]

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,870
Sang Woo's an amateur.
You have to be casual.

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,440
- Do it well.
- Oh no!

39
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,610
- How is that casual?
- What are you doing!

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,530
[Kick, kick.]

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,390
- What are you doing?
- Someone kicked me four times!

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,070
Is it just you girls?
Ow!

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,100
[Her intentional way of refusing.]

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,360
They didn't even see us yet!

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,730
I think only one of
them is a troublemaker!

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,010
There's always at least
one person like that!

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,840
One of them is a dud.

48
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,500
- Oh, it's this person.
- Why are you doing this?

49
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,440
- Hello, ma'am!
- Ma'am?

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,210
You must be out on a family outing!

51

- Dame, come this way.
- If you do this, I won't open the door.

52

She's pretending to be cute!

85
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,190
- Do you know her well?
- Are you close?

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,100
We were in a drama together.
She's the shallow type!

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,240
Be quiet!

88

- They were called MILK.
- From SM?

92

- That's right.
- Really?

93
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,640
- Yeah, Hyun Jin was a singer at SM.
- Oh, I've seen her before.

- She was so young.

- She always wore white clothes.
- Am I old now?

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,960
[Noisy.]

97
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,330
Everyone please take a step back.

98

Don't point fingers at a guest, please!

99
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,440
Wait, wait.

100
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,700
I think Gary has someone
in mind right now.

101
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,410
No!

102
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,330
You're not talking much!
Is there someone here that you like?

103
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,500
- No!
- Be honest!

104
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,730
There are two people.

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,730
[He's been in a loving mood
ever since he saw their tent.]

106
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,530
- I couldn't decide.
- Okay.

107
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,930
- She brought something.
- What is it?

108
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,760
She reminds me of 'A dog of Flanders.'

109
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,500
- Sandwiches.
- Really?

110
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,390
- You packed these?
- Yes, I woke up early.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
She made them herself?

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,990
- There are no vegetables!
- You woke up at 6:30?

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,410
[Embarrassed.]

114
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,270
- Why aren't there any vegetables?
- What's wrong with you!

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,640
- The jam flavors are all different.
- Really?

116
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,580
- Is it good?
- The jam is jaggedly spread.

117
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,010
It's because there were too
many sandwiches to make.

118
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,640
- She probably made them carefully in the morning.
- Anyway it's delicious.

119
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,650
Thank you very much.

120
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,300
[These are the couples.]

121
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,300
- I will explain the rules for today.
- Yes.

122
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,810
In order for you to spent
a refreshing summer

123
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,300
there is something inside
so would you open that up?

124
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,560
Inside the cooler.

125
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,670
- Ice?
- It's a heart-shaped ice!

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,790
- Should we lift it?
- Yes.

127
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,810
Do we have to do something
before it melts?

128
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,410
This ice is given to
each of the couples.

129
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,960
And inside, there is a key that can
open a special box at the mission site.

130
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,960
There are surprising
prizes within those boxes

131
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,010
so melt the ice with the power of love

132
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,700
and obtain the key.

133
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,560
- Okay!
- Within each round

134
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,840
the top three teams that win

135
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,650
will be given the advantage
of melting the ice quickly.

136
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,390
Today, the sun is very hot

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,410
so you will be given the chance
to expose it in direct sunlight.

138
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,210
First place will be given 30 minutes.

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,010
Second place will be given 20 minutes.

140
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,870
And third place will
be given 10 minutes.

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,810
If you win, the more time
you have to melt the ice

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,960
so you have the chance to quickly
melt the ice and take the key.

143
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,500
- Can I just break the ice?
- No, you can't.

144
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,540
[Why would we play the game, then?]

145
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,730
[Kkuk always makes a fuss.]

146
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,000
[Let's go to the vacation location!]

147
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,370
- Can I speak informally...
- Yeah, absolutely.

148
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,970
We've met twice already.

149
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,010
I knew we would.
[They modeled together before.]

150
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:39,140
The-18 year-old, Ye Eun is really cute.

151
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,310
She's pretty but also cute.

152
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,450
- Yeah she was cute and pretty.
- Am I like an older brother or an uncle to you?

153
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,690
- To be honest, an older brother.
- Brother, right?

154
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,290
- Brother Ha Ha.
- Okay! You can call me brother!

155
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,070
My niece.

156
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,340
Out of all the Running man members,
who's the most handsome?

157
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,370
Kwang Soo.

158
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,310
What?

159
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,240
Kwang Soo drools!

160
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,510
He usually drools.

161
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,550
Don't show it in front of him.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,820
Do not show it.

163
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,750
Kwang Soo will start
liking you right away.

164
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,360
He's delusional,
he'll think you like him.

165
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,890
He's the delusional type.

166
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,260
I was going to pick Jong Kook
because I was blinded by victory.

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,170
What are you talking about?

168
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,200
- What are you saying!
- I thought about it...

169
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,300
If you're with Jong Kook,
you'll be exhausted.

170
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,240
- His nagging?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,210
Jong Kook doesn't
want to get married...

172
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,350
No way, he can't?

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,410
You don't think there's a reason?

174
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,190
There's got to be a reason.

175
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,800
I won't say any more.

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,240
[Is someone talking about me?]

177
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,630
- I started off with an album.
- Really?

178
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,570
- You released an album?
- Yes.

179
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,300
What song?

180
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,840
People don't know because
it wasn't that great...

181
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,240
- I don't know.
- We were trying to aim for 'Cool.'

182
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,910
- What was the group name?
- Funny.

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,890
We failed funnily.

184
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,150
- You were in a singing band.
- Yes.

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,460
Now, I see the light.

186
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,730
Your parents must be very proud.

187
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,630
They're in the local area, in Chungnam.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,400
You're a daughter of Chungnam!

189
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,570
Son of a Chungnam.

190
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,840
- I'm pretty tough.
- I see.

191
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,050
You're a daughter of Chungnam.

192
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,620
[Let's go with the son of a Chungnam!]

193
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,000
[The hottest vacation, episode 1.]

194
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,930
['O' Waterpark, Goyang city]

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,230
[What kind of memories will they make?]

196
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,060
[Everyone's getting ready
for the first mission.]

197
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,630
[Huh? A handbag?]

198
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,840
- She's setting aside her handbag.
- Hae Ryung

199
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,610
is not ready for outdoor variety.

200
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,310
- She brought a bag?
- Yeah.

201
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,010
[A lovely pink item.]

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,180
Hae Ryung!
It's outdoor variety!

203
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,620
Hae Ryung is a very honest person.

204
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,460
I asked her which Running man member she likes,
and usually you answer the person that asked.

205
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,630
She honorably answered Kwang Soo.

206
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,460
I asked her who was second place

207
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,730
and she answered Gary.

208
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,670
The two are here.

209
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,710
- What place was Suk Jin?
- I didn't ask.

210
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,470
I gave up after the third place.

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,210
Third place was you.

212
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,010
[I've never been so sorry
after placing third...]

213
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,050
I didn't ask the rest.

214
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,820
Who's last place?

215
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,120
[I can't say it...]

216
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,960
She's not going to say it.

217
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,890
Stop.
She won't answer.

218
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,990
You're with the last place?

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,760
- I learned something new about Seung Eon.
- What is it?

220
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,000
I was told not to tell...

221
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,110
Seung Eon's friends went to a bar...

222
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,580
and saw Lee Kwang Soo.

223
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,620
- Me?
- What happened?

224
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,710
They witnessed that
he was on a blind date.

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,750
- Was it me?
- That's too much!

226
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,080
But Kwang Soo kept
showing his profile.

227
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,150
[I shall earn victory with my profile.]

228
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,190
[Where's your house?
Am I handsome in person?]

229
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,760
- Only his profile!
- You're that type?

230
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,160
- No I'm not.
- So she left because he was annoying.

231
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,830
Where's your house?

232
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,970
Hyun Jin's leaving to Spain soon

233
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,240
[Startled.]

234
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,640
Don't say it!
[What about Spain?]

235
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,980
- She practiced one phrase very hard.
- What is it?

236
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,940
She said 'I will say this
to a man in Spain!

237
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,210
- What is it?
- Tell us!

238
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
- Say it.
- Do it.

239
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,450
I really like the
pronunciation in Spanish.

240
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,220
As soon as I was taught the word,
it memorized on its own.

241
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,690
- Say it in Spanish.

242
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,360
- What is it?
- What does it mean?

243
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,610
It's long.

244
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,500
I want to stay with you tonight.

245
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,300
[Suddenly romantic.]

246
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,200
[Shy, shy.]

247
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,870
[The atmosphere is warm.]

248
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,680
There are people who only
memorize that kind of stuff!

249
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,240
It's the same as do you wanna me?

250
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,210
It's not 'do you wanna me?'
It's 'do you want me?'

251
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,730
[I talk free-style...]

252
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,590
Are you a 'wannamin'?
(native-speaker)

253
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,190
[Yes, we are all
Korean native speakers.]

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,610
Do you like me?

255
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,530
[I will learn other phrases, too.]
Do you want me?

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,470
Do you see the floater behind you?

257
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,190
The first mission is 'Love Island.'

258
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,640
Everyone will dance facing this way.

259
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,440
When the music stops
and the whistle blows

260
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,810
the women will run towards the floater

261
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,270
and the men will run toward
the path with the elephant and lion

262
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,360
and if you see the middle,
it's a diving board.

263
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,270
They will jump into the pool

264
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,190
and onto the floater.

265
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,590
After that, the couple that stayed
on the longest on the floater

266
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,800
with the bridal-carry pose will win.

267
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,240
- It's dance time!
- Yeah!

268
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,610
It's a fun dance time!

269
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,840
[A dance parade in the hot summer.]

270
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,300
[Let's go!]

271
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,200
[The youngest Ye Eun's up first!]

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,080
[It seems like an eel is
ascending to heaven.]

273
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,530
[Unidentifiable dance.]

274
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,650
[A commercial-like pose.]

275
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,340
[Hae Ryung's dance time.]

276
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,940
[Am I cute?]

277
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,000
[Her stage manners are good.]

278
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,630
[Seung Eon's dance time
with her long hair.]

279
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,850
[Her extraordinary energy.]

280
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,800
[She's getting into the rhythm.]

281
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,400
[Can you handle it?]

282
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,900
[She's catching everyone's eye.]

283
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,590
[She knows how to party.]

284
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,240
[I can't lose!]

285
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,840
[Wow!
Hwang Seung Eon.]

286
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,140
[Hana's in the house!]

287
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,120
[She's playing with the rhythm.]

288
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,770
[She's feeling it.]

289
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,540
[The Beyonce of Chungnam.
Her waves are amazing.]

290
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,650
[Irene's slim dance moves.]

291
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,220
[Her chic style.]

292
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,280
[The ex-idol Hyun Jin is out!]

293
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,100
[I'll help you friend...]

294
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,360
Oh my god!

295
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,050
[Direct punishment.]

296
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,770
[I'm not ready for
that kind of dance...]

297
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,980
[Now, it's time for
our only male guest.]

298
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,260
[Do Sang Woo's dance time!]

299
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,930
[While everyone is drunk
in the rhythm...]

300
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,370
[Whistle.]

301
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,440
[Love Island, start!]

302
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,680
[The girls head toward the floater.]

303
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,800
[Then men run towards
the diving board!]

304
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,220
[It's an advantage to take
over the floater first.]

305
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,050
[The men take the alley]

306
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,620
[and arrive at the diving board.]

307
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,040
[They jump without hesitation
towards their partner.]

308
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,560
[Wait ladies!]

309
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,140
[Splash.]

310
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,940
[They show their courage
in front of their partners.]

311
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,130
[Everyone dived.]

312
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,430
[Meanwhile, there's a
war on the floater.]

313
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,760
[The men also need to get
to the floater quickly.]

314
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,800
[They are swimming
towards their partners.]

315
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,410
[One person who can't swim.]

316
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,220
[The men have arrived on the floater.]

317
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,790
[They push them if it
isn't their partner.]

318
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,920
[Hurry up.]

319
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,330
[No way!]

320
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,170
[Blocking with all their might.]

321
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,470
[Hana, I'm here.]

322
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,230
[Jae Suk, gets on the floater
thanks to Hana.]

323
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,970
[Shove]

324
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,510
[Re-dive after two seconds.]

325
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,570
[Gets on the floater by force.]

326
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,740
[You must lift up your partner
for three seconds!]

327
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,890
[The men are getting on the floater
one by one.]

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,230
[Where is my partner?]

329
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,350
[Hae Ryung, I'm here!]

330
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,370
[But, I don't think I can come soon...]

331
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,930
Wait, my shorts!

332
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,510
[Lift]

333
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,310
[Still in the same spot
since five minutes ago.]

334
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,840
[Right then, Ha Ha lifts up Ye Eun.]

335
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,210
[Sang Woo also lifts Ji Hyo up.]

336
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,850
[You only have to wait
three seconds...]

337
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,660
[Splash]

338
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,890
[Giraffe and Kkuk's
joined interruption.]

339
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,820
[While everyone is focused
on Ji Hyo and Sang Woo.]

340
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,190
[Gary and Seung Eon's attempt.]

341
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,630
[Gary and Seung Eon win first place!]

342
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,400
[First place, Gary and Seung Eon.]
Oh my god!

343
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,770
Oh my god!

344
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,450
[While the other teams are
having a bloody battle, they won.]

345
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,880
[It's already over?]

346
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,590
[First place, Gary and Seung Eon.]

347
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,210
I was surprised because
my feet don't reach.

348
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,820
I was also surprised as well.

349
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,720
I thought my feet
would reach but it didn't.

350
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,800
I swam with my eyes open.

351
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,700
[The returned dance time.]

352
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,510
[They're slowly moving towards
the diving board in rhythm.]

353
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,970
Why is everyone over there?

354
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,070
[Because it's better to be closer.]

355
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,820
[The women are all heading
towards the floater.]

356
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,390
[Modern ballet.
The title is 'Heading towards you.'

357
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,820
[At this rate, they're going
to dance on the diving board.]

358
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,980
[Come here.]

359
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,690
[You never know when the
whistle will blow.]

360
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,520
[Whistle.]

361
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,770
[Love Island round two, start!]

362
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,240
[The women towards the floater.]

363
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,140
[Let's meet at the floater!]

364
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,590
[They reached the diving
board in a flash.]

365
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,560
[Ji Hyo reached the floater first.]

366
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,830
[Let's go!]

367
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,430
[Perfect diving position.]

368
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,870
[The rest of them dive
without hesitation.]

369
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,910
[It's all or nothing!]

370
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,580
[May I shouldn't have done that...]

371
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,510
[Kkuk is in the lead.]

372
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,980
[But Irene hasn't even gone
up on the floater yet.]

373
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,580
Irene didn't go up yet.

374
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,550
Isn't it because she's tall?

375
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,060
[Lion's attack.]

376
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,670
[Sang Woo got on the floater.]

377
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,340
[By the way, where is my partner?]

378
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,340
[Does anyone know how to go forward?]

379
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,850
It's impossible!

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,420
Sang Woo tries lifting Ji Hyo
as soon as he gets on the floater.

381
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,310
[Hana's attack.]

382
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,290
Wow!

383
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,090
[Now's the time!]

384
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,550
[Lion's attempt at lifting Irene.]

385
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,390
[Jae Suk gets up on
the unoccupied area.]

386
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,490
[He lifted her up but...]

387
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,270
[He failed at enduring it.]

388
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,060
[Kwang Soo is distracting
Jong Kook and Irene]

389
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,200
[while Jae Suk distracts
Sang Woo and Ji Hyo.]

390
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,340
[Both teams fail.]

391
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,620
[Chaos.]

392
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,780
[There is one woman who is peaceful.]

393
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,620
[I want to try this, too.]

394
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,420
[He's approaching at the
speed of 10 cm per minute.]

395
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,420
[It's so hard to keep you
close when you're so far.]

396
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,030
[Sorry, Hae Ryung.]

397
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,460
[The only couples left on the floater.]

398
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,290
[First you lift up your partner]

399
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,280
[then you have to wait three seconds!]

400
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,580
[But...]

401
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,320
[Oh my god.]

402
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,440
[Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin
fall with Ye Eun's block.]

403
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,880
[Jae Suk and Hana are defenseless.]

404
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,080
It's Jae Suk.

405
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,500
[Jae Suk and Hana succeed!]

406
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,700
[Second place.]

407
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,040
[Am I that heavy, Kwang Soo?]

408
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,040
[Jae Suk's attack and Hana's defense.]

409
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,040
[An amazing collaboration.]

410
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,050
[Second place, Jae Suk and Hana.]

411
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,310
Jong Kook, why are you still here?

412
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,990
The viewer might think
that Irene is heavy.

413
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,040
She wasn't heavy at all.

414
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,960
Kwang Soo, I don't think you
should be the one saying that.

415
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,070
My partner can't even
come onto the floater!

416
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,670
I'm waiting!

417
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,010
Just wait!
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,760
You've never been on the floater?

419
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,590
The game ends before
I can even get to the floater...

420
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,700
[It's a funny story
but it's sad for them...]

421
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,930
People don't know, but Suk Jin is
actually having a deadly battle.

422
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,360
[A big match, the pool vs. Big Nose.]

423
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,790
A battle within himself.

424
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,440
Everyone, it's now time
for a couple dance.

425
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,990
Everyone's makeup is
slowly wearing off.

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
Hyun Jin as well.

427
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,360
But they are still pretty.

428
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,470
- There's no difference.
- Do you know what's scary though?

429
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,360
Hae Ryung still has the full makeup.

430
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,280
No, her makeup wore off.

431
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,330
We'll do a quick test to see
if the couples are a good match.

432
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,860
The mountains or the sea?

433
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,680
- The mountains!
- The sea!

434
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,470
Black bean noodles
or spicy noodles?

435
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,870
- Spicy noodles!
- Black bean noodles!

436
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,530
Summer or winter,
one, two, three!

437
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,500
- Summer!
- Summer!

438
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,010
The mountains or the meadow,
one, two, three!

439
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,240
- The mountains!
- The mountains!

440
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,070
Summer or winter,
one, two, three!

441
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,760
- Summer!
- Summer!

442
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,580
They planned it ahead of time!

443
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,070
I'll give you another chance.

444
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,160
He never loses even
for this kind of stuff!

445
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,810
Look, her makeup wore off.

446
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,160
I want to try hard, but I can't.

447
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,560
No one thinks of me as a target.

448
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,470
Now, it's the couples' dance time!
We'll take a look at the couples

449
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,760
- and we'll pick the order.
- That's important!

450
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,610
Is it clear?
[Glare.]

451
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,790
I'll give you the order.

452
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,610
You have to do your best.

453
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,540
[Couple dance, round three.]
The music is great.

454
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,190
Jump, jump!

455
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,910
[This depends on getting a head start!]

456
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,640
[First up is Suk Jin and Hae Ryung.]

457
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,100
[Gross]

458
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,040
Go back in!

459
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,820
Why?
[Too cloy.]

460
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,730
[Best friend couple,
Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin.]

461
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,500
[Sorry, Kwang Soo.]
Go back in!

462
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,020
[Full of energy,
Ha Ha and Ye Eun.]

463
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,110
[Perfect match]

464
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,270
[A couples' shake dance.]

465
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,560
Come this way.
[A beneficial spot.]

466
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,130
[The handsome couple,
Ji Hyo and Sang Woo.]

467
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,790
Go over there!

468
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
[The children's dance for
track and field day in the 70's.]

469
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,350
[The healthy couple,
Jong Kook and Irene.]

470
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,680
[Reveal]

471
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,150
[He got a good spot
thanks to his six pack.]

472
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,480
[He called himself up to the stage.]

473
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,330
[Perfect match.]

474
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,470
[I can't handle it.]

475
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,110
[Ji Hyo and Sang Woo's re-attempt.]

476
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,400
[They earned third place
with the fitness style dance.]

477
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,140
[Suk Jin and Hae Ryung's
never-ending attempt.]

478
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,680
Go to the end!

479
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,780
[Is this not good enough yet?]

480
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,520
Third place!

481
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,380
[The last one standing,
Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin.]

482
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,520
- Do you know how to do the collapse?
- How am I supposed to do that?

483
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,810
[The whistle blew at the
same time he fell.]

484
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,900
[There's no time to be in pain!]

485
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,270
[Love Island, round three starts!]

486
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,540
[This is the last chance!]

487
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,340
[The last speed battle.]

488
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,050
[The ultra-speedy dive.]

489
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,070
[Except one person...]

490
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,660
Hae Ryung!

491
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,140
[Hurry and jump...]

492
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
[Sorry, I don't think I can handle it.]

493
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,780
[In a flash]

494
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,560
Push him, push!

495
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,800
[Jump.]
You need to push him!

496
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,700
[He takes advantage of the chaos]

497
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,280
[and lifts up Irene!]

498
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,540
[But he fell into the water.]

499
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,760
[Ji Hyo and Sang Woo also fell.]

500
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,270
That was close.

501
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,760
[Now Kwang Soo, Hyun Jin
and Ha Ha, Ye Eun are left.]

502
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,040
[Kwang Soo lifted up Hyun Jin first.]

503
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,280
[If they wait three seconds,
they will win.]

504
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,070
- Were Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin faster?
- Yes.

505
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,590
Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin win!

506
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,990
[They win by a split second.]

507
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,360
[Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin
get third place.]

508
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,500
That was really close.

509
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,990
Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin!

510
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,790
[I'll do well on the next mission!]

511
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
[I wish the next mission
is an individual match...]

512
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,870
[Third place, Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin.]

513
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,680
You are given 30 minutes
to melt your ice.

514
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,330
- You have 20.
- And Kwang Soo.

515
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,210
- We have 10 minutes!
- The rest of you

516
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,190
- will keep your ice in the cooler.
- Let's go!

517
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,770
[No one is awkward with
each other anymore.]

518
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,400
[First mission, complete.]

519
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,860
[♪We'reFreindsNow]
[♪BigNoseSank]

520
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,900
[♪SorryHaeRyung]

521
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,430
[That summer vacation, episode two.]

522
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,160
[What kind of mission will this be?]

523
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,560
We're here, Hae Ryung.

524
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,730
- Cooler...
- The cooler?

525
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,640
Oh, the ice is inside!

526
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,640
It's so cold!

527
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,960
The teams that have won
1st to 3rd place.

528
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,300
- Yes?
- The team that placed first

529
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,790
will take their ice out
and place it over there.

530
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes!

531
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,130
- That's a relief.
- It's freezing!

532
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,340
Don't break it.
If it breaks, that's the end of it.

533
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,130
The sun's facing this way.
Shouldn't we move it slightly?

534
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,960
Sir

535
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,360
please take good care of it.

536
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,130
It's okay.

537
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,760
[Now it's Jae Suk and Hana's turn.]

538
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,700
Thank you very much.

539
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,930
- Don't touch it!
- I'm not touching it.

540
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,900
Don't touch it!

541
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm just checking it!

542
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm just checking if
it's placed correctly!

543
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,730
Now it's Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin's turn.

544
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,790
- You have 10 minutes.
- Please take care of it.

545
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,270
Please time it well.

546
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,210
Kwang Soo, go touch it!

547
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,590
[Sneak.]
Kwang Soo, please come here.

548
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,040
[Slurp.]

549
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,390
I kissed it.

550
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,470
[Poor ice.]

551
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,900
First place gets 30 minutes,
second place gets 20 minutes

552
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,410
and last place gets 10 minutes.

553
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,990
We'll put it back in the
cooler after the correct time.

554
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,360
- Yes.
- We'll now do the second mission.

555
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,040
The second mission is
'When we go on vacation.'

556
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,210
It's a memory game.

557
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,100
<i>When you go on vacation</i>

558
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,500
<i>there's blank.</i>

559
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,410
You need to decide a pose
related to the theme

560
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,140
and hold the pose
when it's your turn.

561
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,420
After the first couple, the second couple
needs to hold the first pose

562
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
then hold your own pose.

563
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,930
If you don't do the pose properly,
or if you forget

564
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,760
you will be eliminated.

565
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,160
I will give you the
theme for the first round.

566
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,760
The theme of the first round
is 'Lovebirds'

567
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,310
You can decide a pose
and come back.

568
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,170
Everyone, go!

569
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,020
We need to think of a difficult pose.

570
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,960
Let's go to that side, Ji Hyo.

571
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,910
[What poses will they show off?]

572
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,590
Maybe we need a few poses,
in case we have more than one turn.

573
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,790
What should we do?

574
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,110
We need to think of something
the other teams can't do.

575
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,810
Yes, we need difficult poses.

576
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,500
Can we just strike any poses?

577
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,970
No, it has to be something lovey-dovey.

578
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,050
Doesn't it have to be difficult?

579
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,940
Yes, difficult and lovey-dovey.

580
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,240
What will be...

581
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,500
What do we need to do?

582
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,010
What do lovey-dovey couples do?
I'm far from it.

583
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,530
But you are.

584
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,530
I only know this.

585
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,270
Just pretending to be cute.

586
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,020
- But that's too easy.
- We need something they can't remember.

587
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,940
- It should be either difficult...
- What should we do?

588
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,050
Or something that's too lovey-dovey.

589
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,210
What could it be?

590
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,870
Something touchy-feely...

591
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,870
I'm not saying we should...

592
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,360
It's okay, we decided
to act like siblings.

593
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,170
We can do it, but others can't.

594
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,390
We don't have many choices though.

595
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,020
[Hurt]
If you say so...

596
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,240
Should we hug?

597
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,330
[Should I hug you?]

598
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,930
[You and me...]

599
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,670
[we're just friends.]

600
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,970
[This hug...]

601
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,810
[can change our relationship...]

602
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,130
It's too much!
I can't handle it!

603
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,960
It's not like I like it...

604
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,210
[It feels uncomfortable!]

605
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,390
I mean something like this
can't be done with other teams.

606
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,880
You know I only tried it
for the game, right?

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,310
I said I've got it.

608
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,990
Hana, are you flexible?

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
- A little.
Can you...

610
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,930
- Put your leg around your neck.
- That, I can't.

611
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,650
Can you grab your leg like this?

612
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,480
Maybe I can put it on your shoulder.

613
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,200
Ugh, wait a minute!

614
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,390
[Back pain]

615
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,100
Did you fracture your pelvis?

616
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,330
- Did it hurt you?
- That was little hard.

617
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,020
Was that?

618
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,110
[The flexible idol is here.]
This is good.

619
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,990
I think Kim Jong Gook will
strike a really difficult pose.

620
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,360
Maybe he will hold her.

621
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,360
[That is true.]

622
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,590
[When we go on vacation,
you will see an iron man.]

623
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,840
[They are getting too physical.]

624
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,280
[It's getting annoying.]

625
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,770
[Suk Jin and Hae Ryung
want to counterattack.]

626
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,510
It seems Hae Ryung
doesn't want to do it.

627
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,710
What is that?

628
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,970
Why do you have to bend her back?

629
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,360
[Passionate!]

630
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,800
Great!
Let's do this!

631
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,650
It looks like Thai massage.

632
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,710
What should I do?

633
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,510
Hugging from behind won't work.

634
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,530
What do we do then?

635
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,000
What do we do so no one can't do?

636
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,910
[The time-out is over.]
Everyone, come back!

637
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,050
As you already know,
the order of your turn is important.

638
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,990
Who goes first matters.

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,170
Ladies will come out and play
rock-paper-scissors.

640
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,190
Isn't that too simple?

641
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,310
Just play scissors and you'll win.

642
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,790
- Win!
- Good luck!

643
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,760
Rock-paper-scissors.

644
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,780
[Hyun Jin, Hana, Seung Eon,
and Ye Eun played paper.]

645
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,870
[Blank Ji, Irene and
Hae Ryung played rock.]

646
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,300
Hae Ryung, I told you to play scissors.

647
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,870
Rock-paper-scissors.

648
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,960
[Blank Ji: paper]
[Irene, Hae Ryung: rock]

649
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,670
I told you to play scissors!

650
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,000
If you say that loud...

651
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,670
Rock-paper-scissors.

652
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,810
[She keeps playing rock.]

653
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,930
[Is it that you hate the Big-nose
or you hate scissors?]

654
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,530
You don't match at all.

655
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,770
They're going further from winning.

656
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,590
[Can our relationship...]

657
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,390
[be saved?]
Hae Ryung!

658
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,210
['When We Go On Vacation.']
Let's begin!

659
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,510
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple.

660
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,710
I knew they would do
something like this.

661
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,790
[Shocking]
How can we do that?

662
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,010
Wait a moment.

663
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,260
It's not even funny!

664
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,390
[The scorpion pose!]

665
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,300
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple

666
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,410
we'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

667
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,070
[Will she be able to do
the scorpion pose?]

668
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,910
[She successfully repeats the pose.]

669
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,850
It's okay.
Just hold on for a second.

670
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,390
We'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

671
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,220
Hey, hey, hey!

672
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,280
[Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin's pose...
is push-up.]

673
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,790
[Her legs fell.]

674
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,790
[Landed]

675
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,470
- They did three times.
- Five times!

676
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,330
It was three!
She fell!

677
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,370
It's three, then.

678
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,140
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple

679
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,040
we'll see Hyun Jin's couple

680
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,330
we'll see Seung Eon's couple.

681
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,640
We'll see Kwang Soo's couple!

682
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,050
[They held the first pose.]

683
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,220
[They held the second pose.]
We'll see Gary's couple!

684
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,930
[What will be their pose?]

685
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,100
[Surprised]

686
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,390
Wow, she can do that?

687
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,940
[The bridge!]

688
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,330
[I'm very sorry.]

689
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,600
It's the easiest one for us.

690
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,050
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple

691
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,410
Do Ha Ha's couple's pose.

692
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,420
[They held the first pose.]

693
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,110
We'll see Kwang Soo's couple!

694
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,780
You feel numb, right?

695
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,070
[She's screaming inside.]

696
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,360
Hana is holding her pelvis...

697
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,610
One...

698
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,210
Why are you...

699
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,970
Is she heavy?

700
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,330
The next.
We'll see Gary's couple!

701
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,270
The third pose.
The bridge.

702
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,400
That's right, Hana.

703
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,410
Great!
You did it!

704
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,760
[They held the third pose.]

705
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,160
We'll see Jae Suk's couple!

706
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,480
Hana, come over here.
Are you okay?

707
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,300
[Deep bow]

708
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,530
[His weak legs!]

709
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,990
They failed!

710
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,300
Does the fall include?

711
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,670
Yes, our pose include the fall.

712
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,680
- The fall is part of it.
- What?

713
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,810
It's part of it?

714
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,390
Look, you're supposed to fall
and casually get up.

715
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,100
- Again.
- What is that?

716
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,990
They're so shameless.

717
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,610
Clap your feet five times.

718
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,500
Don't make up stuff now!

719
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,410
What are you doing all of a sudden?

720
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,440
- This is it.
- Doesn't it count as two?

721
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,740
- Squat five times.
- Just do one thing!

722
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,450
We'll cancel the previous movement.

723
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,390
One, two, three, four!

724
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,480
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple.

725
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,170
- Can Ji Hyo do it?
- I don't think she can.

726
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,560
I did it!
This is right!

727
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,340
That looks totally different.
Show her.

728
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,590
[High-rise building vs.
One story house.]

729
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,470
Ye Eun is a little annoying.

730
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,790
She said in a cute voice.
'This is it.'

731
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,940
Even the tone of speaking is different.

732
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,590
[A baby-sounding tone vs.
Passionate tone]

733
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,310
Excuse me, old lady!

734
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,440
We'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

735
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,990
Sang Woo is shaking.

736
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,650
His legs are very thin.

737
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,190
We'll see Gary's couple.

738
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,500
I don't think she can.

739
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,330
Don't push yourself!

740
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,820
- Your hands are wrong.
- The other way.

741
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,760
Why did you do this pose?

742
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,000
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

743
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,300
She can do it.

744
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,240
- Like this?
- She did it.

745
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,990
I started clapping for some reason.

746
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,410
Ji Hyo did it.

747
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,340
I was cheering her from my heart.

748
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,220
We'll see Jae Suk's couple.

749
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,070
[Charge!]
He did what I did.

750
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,590
This is exactly what I did.

751
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,130
Very good!

752
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,390
One, two, three, four, and five!

753
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,390
One, two, three...

754
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,190
- four, five.
- He's doing it too lightly.

755
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,240
Anyway, they did it.

756
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,910
We'll see Sang Woo's couple.

757
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,940
- We'll see Sang Woo's couple.
- It's easy.

758
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,730
What is their pose?

759
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,210
(Children's play: Little husband)

760
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,560
[Embarrassing]
This is hard.

761
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,450
[I can't take it sober.]
It's too hard.

762
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,440
We'll see Sang Woo's couple.

763
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,540
This is too much!

764
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,340
[After the four physical challenge,
they have to face a mental challenge.]

765
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,040
[Mr. Capable couple's turn.]

766
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,050
[The most powerful, Mr. Capable
and former volleyball player, Irene.]

767
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,680
- Can Irene do the pose 1?
- She's doing it.

768
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,410
She's flexible.

769
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,190
Look, he's doing it properly.

770
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,870
[She's doing the bridge easily.]

771
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
[Look at this couple...]

772
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,270
One, two, three, four.

773
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,540
You need to look at each other's eyes!
[They cleared the fifth state easily.]

774
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,610
We'll see Jong Kook's couple.

775
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,870
Wait a minute.

776
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,270
[She sits on his shoulder.]

777
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,500
[Pale]
You need to use one hand.

778
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,210
[How could I possibly...]

779
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,240
Bye-bye!

780
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,560
See you next time, Hae Ryung!

781
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,770
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Ha Ha's couple.

782
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,960
[The first, scorpion pose.]

783
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,270
That's good!
[She does it easily.]

784
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,300
When we go on vacation

785
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,250
- We'll see Kwang Soo's couple.
- This vacation won't last long.

786
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,130
Bye!

787
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,390
[When everyone thinks it's over...]

788
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,330
[I can't end it like this!]

789
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,640
[I will make up
for the previous games.]

790
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,310
[Just trust Big-nosed brother!]

791
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,040
[Plop]

792
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,820
[Stop dreaming!]

793
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,900
[I feel so bad for Hae Ryung.]

794
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,930
Please give them one more chance.

795
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,170
- One more time.
- Sit on his upper back.

796
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,300
That's right.
It's better.

797
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,770
He's not really doing a push..

798
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,200
He did it.

799
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,400
[Fall]

800
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,840
Hae Ryung, come back next time.

801
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,990
Try come back for another time.

802
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,340
You should have won
rock-paper-scissors.

803
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,310
We prepared so many poses.

804
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,040
One team is dropped,
so it makes six teams.

805
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,540
We will have three winning teams,
so three more teams will be dropped.

806
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,810
We'll change the theme.

807
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,140
The second round's theme is
'The Model Couple.'

808
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,900
- It's a pose, right?
- Yes.

809
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,390
You can discuss it now.

810
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,610
Can you give us
cross stitches materials?

811
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,240
So we can kill our time.

812
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,620
- This one's okay.
- This one and...

813
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,730
Like that, and I can
hang on to your legs.

814
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,960
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

815
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,310
I don't think other guys can do this.

816
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,900
It's good enough.

817
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,840
- Are you flexible?
- No, I'm not.

818
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,240
Should I do splits?

819
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,010
You can do splits...

820
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,670
- I did it.
- Then I will...

821
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,480
you can grab here or
do something behind my back.

822
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,670
I'll do the nike kick and turn.

823
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,410
Then, I'll do this.

824
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,500
Wait, this is too hard.

825
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,910
- Let's do this one first.
- The time-out is over.

826
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,040
I feel so bad for Hae Ryung.

827
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,250
[The first and second winners'
ice hearts are still in the sun.]

828
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,040
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Kang Gary!

829
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,310
[Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Ha Ha: rock]
[Gary, Sang Woo, Jong Kook: scissors]

830
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,280
Jong Kook, your luck is not so great.

831
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,370
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Gary and Hwang Seung Eon is the fourth.

832
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,400
Rock-paper-scissors.

833
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,110
[Jong Kook and Irene: the fifth]
[Ji Hyo and Do Sang Woo: the sixth]

834
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,410
Rock-paper-scissors.

835
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,340
[Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun Jin: the first]

836
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,270
Rock-paper-scissors.

837
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,320
[Jae Suk and Park Hana: the second]
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun: the third]

838
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,680
I think it's not so bad be the third.

839
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,990
Please stand on the R mark.

840
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,740
This is 'the Model Couple.'

841
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,440
One, two, three, four!

842
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,710
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

843
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,270
- What is it?
- Hey, hey!

844
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,680
She's so flexible.

845
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,310
It might be finished early.

846
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,970
[Are you talking about me?]

847
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,760
He can't hold his pose.

848
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,530
[Fall]
[I looked very casual.]

849
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,900
Is that it?

850
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,070
Show us properly.

851
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,070
- Hurry up.
- What are you doing?

852
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,880
- Please twist my legs.
- You can't help him!

853
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,470
Stop it!

854
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,390
What are you doing?

855
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,700
You said you can do it.

856
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,010
He's disqualified!

857
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,330
[Surprised]

858
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,100
This isn't right!

859
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,190
I'll give you one more chance.

860
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,220
- You should hold a pose for 5 seconds.
- Just hold any pose.

861
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,500
Let's hold all the pose
for five seconds.

862
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,500
This is too hard.

863
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,970
Am I the last one?

864
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,220
[Ta-da!]

865
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,790
[Safety comes first.]

866
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,500
- What is that?
- Good job!

867
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,970
[Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun Jin's
turn is over.]

868
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,000
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

869
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,760
I think she can do it.

870
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,100
- Wow!
- Wait!

871
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,040
Hana!

872
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,790
Just do it quickly.

873
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,730
That's right!

874
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,610
- Hurry up, Jae Suk!
- Did you forget?

875
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,470
Don't tell him.

876
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,220
Put one knee on the ground.

877
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:57,870
One, two, three, four, and five!

878
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,440
Hana!
[My pelvis!]

879
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,940
Hana, you should stay home for a while.

880
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,070
Cancel tomorrow's schedule!

881
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,930
Her pelvis is...

882
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,960
Isn't it too much?

883
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,100
[Is this hard?]

884
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,670
[A taste of hell]
That's like splitting the pelvis!

885
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,700
You did well, Hana.

886
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,480
Should I bring you a screwdriver?

887
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,910
Do I need to tighten
some screws of yours?

888
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,960
- Are you okay?
- Show us your pose!

889
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,360
One, two, three!

890
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,130
[Ta-da!]
What is that?

891
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,610
[Does it supposed to be
an elegant pose?]

892
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,410
Her fingers are pointing down.

893
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,680
[They held the overhead kick pose.]
Very good, Hana.

894
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,080
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun's turn to
reveal their pose.]

895
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,330
We'll see Ha Ha's couple.

896
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,740
- What are they doing?
- One!

897
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,760
One, two...

898
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,080
Is this for getting rid of Jong Kook?

899
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,390
They did it!

900
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,190
[The female has to carry the man
on her back and squats 5 times.]

901
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,670
Amazing.
[Gary and Hwang Seung Eon's turn]

902
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,600
When we go on vacation,
we'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

903
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,300
She's flexible, too!

904
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,960
Why come everyone can do this?

905
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,650
I know one person that can't do this.

906
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,300
Everyone except Ji Hyo can.

907
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:29,240
You'll see Jae Suk's couple!

908
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,370
[The second pose, overhead kick]

909
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,740
[She looks comfortable.]
You made it.

910
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,330
We'll see Ha Ha's couple!

911
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,640
[We'll be in trouble
if they can do it.]

912
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,840
It's five squats!

913
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,870
Wait!

914
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,130
[Just doing it once
will make her fall.]

915
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,500
They should not be able to do this!

916
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,440
It's over!

917
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,870
Stop it!

918
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,440
[It's exciting!]

919
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,280
Stop it, Jae Suk!

920
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,360
[You've worked hard, Gary.
It's time to leave!]

921
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,590
- Wait a second.
- One...

922
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,590
two...
[Landing]

923
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,930
[Gary and Hwang Seung Eon drop.]

924
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,130
[Thanks to you, we're survived!]

925
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,070
We survived!

926
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,100
Do you want to see her pose?

927
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,130
Seung Eon, come here.
Show them.

928
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,110
Why did you make us drop?

929
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,040
- You must see her pose.
- Show us.

930
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,570
I was going to turn
something like this.

931
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,860
[Rotate]

932
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:48,800
[Her wrist turns 360 degrees?]

933
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,070
[What is going on here?]

934
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,340
[Shocking!]
We could have finished them.

935
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,940
- What was that?
- Can we show it on TV?

936
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,150
- Why not?
- If you can show this.

937
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,510
Don't you have any skill like this?

938
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,850
[The third round]
[Hana and Jae Suk are dropped.]

939
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:16,990
The next theme is 'creepy couple.'

940
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,930
I'll give you three minutes.

941
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,130
If anyone can make
their eyes exotropia, they will win.

942
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,370
You could have used your pose
for this topic.

943
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,370
It's too bad!

944
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,940
I was watching 'The true game.'

945
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,300
Someone said she's in
the Guinness Book of Records.

946
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,880
I just did it and thought
what's so special about it?

947
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,840
How is it possible?

948
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,410
I feel really sorry for Hae Ryung.

949
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,150
Please show her reactions on TV.

950
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,950
Even on the floating mat...

951
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,520
she waited for me
for the whole time.

952
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,020
Then I couldn't even do one push-up.

953
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,230
I feel really bad because...

954
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,190
I asked if she can do stretches.

955
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,760
She can do it all.

956
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
Can she?

957
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,570
[It rips my heart apart.]
She can do all of it.

958
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,160
I feel sorry, too.

959
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,880
[A bad memory of a big-nosed man.]

960
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,240
[The time-out is over.]
Please come back!

961
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,570
They just need to make one team fail.

962
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,710
[They will play rock-paper-scissors.]

963
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,070
Rock-paper-scissors.

964
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,670
[Hyun Jin and Blank Ji: paper]
Irene, Ye Eun: rock]

965
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,890
[Jong Kook and Irene: the third]
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun: the fourth]

966
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,850
[Maybe playing later
is better now.]

967
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:34,360
- Is Ha Ha's couple last?
- Yes, they are.

968
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

969
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,800
[Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun Jin: the first]
[Ji Hyo and Do Sang Woo: the second]

970
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,420
We'll start now!

971
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,790
One, two, three, four!
When we go on vacation

972
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,270
Kwang Soo's couple.

973
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,340
I'm nervous.
What are they going to do?

974
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,610
They always sit down.

975
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,870
[They look like circus crews.]

976
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,280
- She has to hold him?
- Can you actually do it?

977
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,190
- Are they deciding now?
- They're fighting.

978
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,810
What are you doing?

979
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,940
- Is it your first time?
- I don't want to give up!

980
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,940
I'm scared!

981
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,070
Usually, female starts on the top.

982
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,570
Think carefully.
You're only here because of Hyun Jin!

983
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:25,670
- He told me to roll, but...
- Be quiet!

984
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,130
Can you actually do it?

985
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,420
He wants to roll?

986
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,300
[If they succeed...]

987
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:40,000
[no one will be able to do it.]

988
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,740
[A head shot on the ground]
This is it?

989
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,240
This is it?

990
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,730
What is that?

991
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,070
Kwang Soo!

992
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,440
Just do the split.

993
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,210
All of a sudden, do the split again?

994
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:02,590
When we go on vacation,
you'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

995
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,100
- That is creepy.
- How about a center split?

996
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,390
Just worry about your couple.

997
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,310
- I feel so bad for them.
- Just take care of Hae Ryung.

998
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,800
I'm so sorry, Hae Ryung.

999
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,590
[Kwang Soo's support]

1000
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,330
[Another try for the twisted legs]

1001
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,640
He twisted twice.

1002
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,440
What's that?

1003
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,130
- It has to be twice.
- This is it.

1004
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,730
- Wait.
- Do you have another one?

1005
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,130
[one eye squint.]

1006
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,160
It's just one eye!

1007
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,670
- What do we do?
- That's great.

1008
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,160
What did he do with his legs?

1009
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,670
You twist your legs twice.

1010
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,020
Jong Kook can't do it.

1011
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,340
Jong Kook's thick muscle
prevents him from doing it.

1012
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,510
When we go on vacation,
you'll see Kwang Soo's couple.

1013
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,840
It's going to be hard.

1014
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,180
Ji Hyo can't do a split.

1015
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,610
Do you need my help?

1016
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,920
Ji Hyo is upset.

1017
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,750
<i>Wow!</i>

1018
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,660
Why are you screaming?
Don't lie.

1019
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,060
That's too much support!

1020
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,030
If you look at her from behind.
She's just doing this.

1021
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,400
- No! I'm not!
- It's not exactly like that.

1022
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,000
Come see her from behind!

1023
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,210
Or use the helicam.

1024
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,040
You can't compare her
with someone who practices yoga.

1025
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,110
That's right.
I haven't tried yoga.

1026
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,480
Even if we let her pass,
if Sang Woo can't make the squint eye.

1027
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,450
No one can do it.
It's easy to squint with both eyes!

1028
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,150
But one eye squint is hard!

1029
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,320
Let Ji Hyo pass.

1030
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,690
[Center split+leg twist
+one eye squint]

1031
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,600
Check his eyes.

1032
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,930
Did he do that?

1033
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:08,540
- I did it.
- He did it.

1034
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:13,780
- Should I pull your legs?
- No.

1035
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,510
- Just a little.
- Hey, Kwang Soo!

1036
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,220
She did it!
[She needs to hold it for 5 seconds.]

1037
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,880
Ji Hyo made it.

1038
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,890
Hurry up!

1039
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,890
[Ji Hyo and Do Sang Woo fail.]

1040
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,960
We're relieved.

1041
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,730
Ji Hyo did it very well today.

1042
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,300
I don't practice yoga.
You should let it pass!

1043
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,030
You try!

1044
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,800
[Why me?]

1045
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,460
You, try!

1046
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,860
[Gangster Ji Hyo returns.]

1047
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:51,180
- Ji Hyo.
- Mr. Kim Jong Kook!

1048
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,320
I understand.

1049
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,020
This is how you do it?

1050
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,450
Kwang Soo's couple is winning.

1051
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,150
We should have gotten rid of Kwang Soo!

1052
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,650
To get rid of Kwang Soo,
we need to play this game.

1053
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,850
But I was going to fail next.

1054
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,350
We feel very uncomfortable.

1055
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,960
[We've already lost,
do we have to listen to them?]

1056
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,070
Look at us.
Look at me and Hae Ryung!

1057
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,540
Why do they talk about it for so long?

1058
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,880
Hae Ryung, they will show you
when you react to other people.

1059
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,420
We're so sorry!

1060
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,920
Why don't you try?

1061
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,490
[Let's go to the next mission site!]

1062
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:43,300
[Episode 2 during the vacation]

1063
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:48,300
[Episode 3 during the vacation]

1064
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:53,340
[The third mission of 'Love vacation.']

1065
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,580
Are we going to get
some cream on our faces?

1066
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,080
Isn't that the whipped cream game?

1067
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,850
Ji Suk Jin almost won this game.

1068
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,250
That's right, I remember.

1069
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,750
That's whipped cream?

1070
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,320
What is that?

1071
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,190
[The full packaged summer vacation]

1072
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,430
They put some balls in the water.

1073
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,390
Kwon Ryul is enjoying the bubble bath.

1074
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,590
You must be rich.

1075
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,790
[It's really nice.]

1076
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,610
What is this?

1077
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,340
Are we going to take a bubble bath?

1078
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,680
The third mission is the pool party.

1079
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,540
This place is designed
for pool parties.

1080
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,700
It's a party pool.

1081
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,820
I host pool parties every other week.

1082
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,560
You?

1083
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,020
You don't even host
your birthday party.

1084
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,410
[It's party time!]

1085
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,220
One person sits on the cream machine.

1086
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,100
The other person goes into the pool.

1087
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,010
Search and pick up the ball
with the color I say.

1088
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,710
You will win when you put the ball

1089
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,280
in the donut pool float
in front of your partner.

1090
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,580
Except that couple, everyone will
have the cream on their faces.

1091
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:18,920
During the first round, guys will sit
on the cream machine.

1092
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,560
Hana!
Hana is the one and not two.

1093
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,130
Eon is Eon and it's not Non.

1094
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,660
- Hana, you can do it!
- Good luck, Seo Hyun Jin!

1095
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,770
- Hana!
- Hae Ryung!

1096
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,470
We've done nothing so far!
We need to win this!

1097
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,250
[Hae Ryung has to believe in herself.]

1098
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,350
For those of you who
one the previous round

1099
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:47,250
we'll give you the better reward
because the sun is not out.

1100
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,770
We'll put some water
in your coolers.

1101
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,840
[For 15 minutes!]
It so unfair!

1102
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,870
That's too much!

1103
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,570
It will melt the whole ice!

1104
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,370
Stick to the original plan!

1105
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,260
[The ice and the water's
blind date for 15 minutes.]

1106
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:08,970
[How much will the ice
melt in the water?]

1107
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,640
You need to find... green balls!

1108
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,390
- Let's go!
- Hae Ryung!

1109
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,170
Hae Ryung!
[Splash!]

1110
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,770
[Let's party!]
[Find the green ball.]

1111
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,620
- Hae Ryung!
- Hana!

1112
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,170
[Are they in the middle of
photo shoot?]

1113
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,450
[Throbbing]

1114
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,850
[The photo shoot is over.]

1115
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,270
[It's like a blind test.]

1116
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,760
It's here!

1117
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,820
It's over here, Seung Eon!

1118
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,220
Get the green!

1119
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,540
[The green ball under the bubble...]

1120
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,540
[is right next to her feet!]

1121
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,270
[Ji Hyo dives in!]

1122
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,700
[Ji Hyo acquires the green ball!]

1123
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,590
Ji Hyo caught it!

1124
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,080
Ji Hyo!

1125
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,050
[She drops Ye Eun and shot!]

1126
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:21,140
[The ball is heading
to the donut pool float.]

1127
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,740
[They couldn't win the previous games.]

1128
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,800
[No goal!]

1129
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,480
[I missed it!]

1130
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,080
Try to look for it under the water.

1131
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,110
Run as soon as you grab it!

1132
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,600
[Irene found a green ball.]

1133
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,300
[Irene's shot!]

1134
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,900
[Former volleyball player Irene...]

1135
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,270
It's too short!

1136
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,140
Just crawl up!

1137
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,520
What are you doing, Hae Ryung?

1138
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,890
[Under the bubbles,
Hyun Jin catches a green ball.]

1139
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,250
[But Hana is standing
right in front of her.]

1140
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,610
Steal it, Hae Ryung!

1141
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,840
Hyun Jin, no!

1142
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,420
Don't let her throw the ball.

1143
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,200
Wait a minute!

1144
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,060
Kick them with your knee!

1145
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,030
Let me get out for a second.

1146
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,800
Hey, let me...

1147
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,300
What are you doing, Seung Eon?

1148
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,210
[She is searching for the ball
by herself.]

1149
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,410
Where are you, Ji Hyo?

1150
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,450
[Ji Hyo is surrounded by the bubbles.]

1151
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,580
Look at her!

1152
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,820
She caught one.
Irene has it.

1153
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,650
[Go to the right!]

1154
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,220
[Hyun Jin jumps.]

1155
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,720
[Grabs]

1156
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:50,050
- That's right!
- Hyun Jin!

1157
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,590
[Irene attempts to
get out of the pool.]

1158
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,480
[Give me the ball before you leave.]

1159
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,080
[The ladies' powerful party.]

1160
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,970
[Founders, keepers.]

1161
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,650
Great, Ye Eun!
Dunk shot!

1162
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,920
[I don't want to get
the cream on my face!]

1163
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,050
[What a passionate vacation!]

1164
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:23,620
[Who will the lucky guy
that will avoid the cream?]

1165
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,470
[Ye Eun wins.]

1166
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,310
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun's ball is in.]

1167
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,250
[Head shots!]

1168
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,110
[The summer facial massage!]

1169
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,420
Very good, Ye Eun!
[The first winner of the pool party.]

1170
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,780
[Totally exhausted]

1171
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,250
[I don't think I can win this round...]

1172
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:52,650
I'm sorry, Sang Woo!

1173
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,020
It's okay, Ji Hyo.
It happens.

1174
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:59,360
Kwang Soo!
[Is he happy to be touched?]

1175
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,130
[The cream hit Yoo Hyuk's nose.]

1176
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:08,470
Hae Ryung, you're doing it on purpose?

1177
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,010
We're out of this now.

1178
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,910
[I'm going to win this
no matter what!]

1179
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,550
[The second round of the pool party.]
This is for the second place.

1180
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,780
Kwang Soo!

1181
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:26,090
[Everyone is cheering their partners.]

1182
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,520
I feel sorry for Hae Ryung.

1183
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,510
[She's ready for the cream.]

1184
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,500
Hae Ryung already gave up.

1185
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,830
This time...

1186
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:42,570
there are only three balls in the pool.

1187
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,310
And the color of the balls is pink.

1188
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,640
I will stay dry.

1189
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,080
Ready... go!

1190
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,220
[Dive in!]

1191
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,390
[He grabbed it but lost it.]

1192
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,010
I can see it!

1193
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,670
[I'm not afraid of the bubbles!]

1194
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,190
[I'll get the second place!]

1195
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,300
[The guys are very enthusiastic.]

1196
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,590
- It's really hard to see.
- It is!

1197
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,670
Where is the pink ball?

1198
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,370
Don't talk, just come!

1199
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,340
I can't see!

1200
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,180
[Yoo Hyuk dives with his eyes open.]

1201
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,770
[The bubbles swallowed the pink balls.]

1202
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,380
I can't see it!

1203
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,680
[Did he get the pink ball?]

1204
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,390
[His cover-up strategy worked!]

1205
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,620
[There is no one to stop him!]

1206
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,730
[He goes straight
to the donut pool float.]

1207
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:51,500
I did it!

1208
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,970
- It's a red ball!
- It's red!

1209
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:58,070
Is this a red ball?

1210
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,110
[This is the pink ball
he's supposed to get.]

1211
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,050
That is red!

1212
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,050
You surprised me!
[He goes back to the pool.]

1213
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,280
[It's embarrassing.]

1214
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,110
[They can't find the pink balls.]

1215
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,160
That's red!

1216
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,480
We all have color-weakness!

1217
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,100
[Mr. Capable gets the ball first.]

1218
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,100
[No one figured it out.]

1219
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,100
[I need to finish it in one breath!]

1220
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,510
[I need to block him...]

1221
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,210
[He concealed it perfectly.]

1222
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,510
[Mr. Capable puts the pink ball in.]

1223
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:42,520
[The cream goes on their face!]

1224
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,680
[To be with Mr. Capable or not
makes the difference.]

1225
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,220
That monstrous...

1226
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,030
[Jong Kook and Irene
get the second place.]

1227
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,000
[We could have won it.]

1228
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,430
[It feels like we're in a cake shop.]

1229
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,500
I couldn't see any of the pink.

1230
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,300
Because you're not
wearing your glasses.

1231
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,140
You should have seen
Jae Suk's face before.

1232
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,570
It was over here.

1233
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,080
- Is this red?
- It's red.

1234
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,680
Are you okay?

1235
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,480
Jae Suk is acting strange!

1236
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,120
Just wear your glasses.

1237
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,620
[Ten minutes passed.]

1238
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,660
[The last round of the pool party.]

1239
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,960
Please let me win once.

1240
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,830
You will have to get two colors.

1241
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:31,530
You need to put a yellow ball
and a blue ball.

1242
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,630
That's too hard!

1243
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,070
Why are you so mean to us?

1244
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,540
Once the ball goes in,
you can't take it out.

1245
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:41,570
The couple with two balls
will get the third place.

1246
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,640
[Go away!]

1247
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,350
Hana, I'll win this time!

1248
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,820
It's yellow, not green!

1249
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:52,850
[They found a yellow ball.]

1250
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:54,990
It's yellow!

1251
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,630
Don't lose the battle!

1252
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,480
I love you, Kwang Soo!

1253
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:01,360
Do you mean it?

1254
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,960
Kwang Soo takes it as a yes.

1255
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,530
We're just friends.

1256
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,500
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1257
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,490
Go, frog fingers, go!

1258
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,700
Good luck, God Yoo!

1259
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,360
Hana, just wait for me!

1260
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,470
Go, Kang Gary!

1261
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,910
Let us win once!

1262
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,190
I'll make your dream come true!

1263
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,070
Isn't this sad?

1264
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,210
I'm sorry, Hae Ryung...

1265
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,590
Let's begin!

1266
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,730
[The pool party, third round]

1267
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,800
Yellow and blue.
Get ready!

1268
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,340
Set, go!

1269
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,370
[Fall!]

1270
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,640
[Except Big-nose, everyone dives in.]

1271
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:53,200
Suk Jin is the goalkeeper.

1272
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,850
[Grab this blue ball...]

1273
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,250
[Kwang Soo finds a yellow ball.]

1274
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,680
[Splash!]

1275
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,250
Suk Jin is telling on Kwang Soo!

1276
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,450
[Kwang Soo approaches
to the goal.]

1277
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,530
[Jae Suk has two balls!]

1278
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,240
Look at Jae Suk!

1279
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,470
[Only if he can put them...]

1280
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,930
[Giraffe leaps at once.]

1281
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,940
[Catch him!]

1282
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,250
[He gives up on his shorts
and gets the goal.]

1283
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,870
[The yellow ball is in!]

1284
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,390
Block Jae Suk!

1285
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,160
[I won't make the same mistakes again.]

1286
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,220
Jae Suk!

1287
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:44,760
[This is my only chance!]

1288
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:48,430
[I need to block him!]

1289
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,790
[Jae Suk goes back to the pool.]

1290
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,480
[The partners fluctuate
between hopes and fears.]

1291
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,880
- He will win.
- Block him!

1292
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,910
[Gary goes into water
and gets a blue ball.]

1293
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:10,850
[Sang Woo disappears in the bubbles.]

1294
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,160
[Gary holds the blue ball
and runs.]

1295
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,460
[Big-nose is having a battle
with Jae Suk.]

1296
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:24,470
[When everyone is concerned
about their own balls...]

1297
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,170
[Sang Woo goes through
the thick bubble wall...]

1298
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,740
[Do Sang Woo appears!]

1299
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:36,700
[He casually walks to
the donut pool float...]

1300
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,810
[and puts the yellow ball
and the blue ball.]

1301
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,620
[Ji Hyo and Do Sang Woo
get the third place!]

1302
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,170
[The last four recipients]

1303
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,110
[It's a pleasant sound that
wraps up the pool party.]

1304
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,480
Hana, you look funny at least.

1305
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,790
Was that me?

1306
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,170
[Just give up like me
and you'll be peaceful.]

1307
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:02,650
[Ji Hyo and Sang Woo
finally wins a game.]

1308
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,470
Suk Jin didn't even get one.

1309
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:10,050
Hae Ryung, sorry for today.

1310
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,290
Jae Suk wears glasses
then he says it's red.

1311
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,900
He regained his health.

1312
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,810
It has melted so much!

1313
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:22,820
It's melted!

1314
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,130
Good, good.
Hyun Jin!

1315
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,510
We need to start
the final mission quickly.

1316
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:30,350
- Our ice is this small!
- Really?

1317
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,360
[Who will get the key
during the final mission?]

1318
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,840
[♪BubbleParty]
[♪YeEunTheStrongest]

1319
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,740
[♪HaeRyungWeSuck]

1320
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,850
[The hottest couple
during the vacation.]

1321
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,000
[The seven couples' coolers
are in a row.]

1322
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,620
This is it.

1323
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,210
They're space heaters!

1324
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,250
[The reward of the third mission]

1325
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,170
I wonder how big
Hae Ryung's ice is.

1326
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:06,990
We have a brand new ice heart.

1327
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,410
As Ha Ha and Ye Eun won the first place

1328
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,420
you can melt your ice with
the fan heater for five minutes.

1329
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,840
Jong Kook and Irene
can melt it for three minutes.

1330
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:25,850
I'm sorry, but the second and
the third place are different...

1331
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:29,360
Yes, I know.
The third couple...

1332
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:32,020
Your temper is very hot.

1333
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,650
Can use the fan heater for two minutes.

1334
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:38,310
Five minutes, three minutes
and two minutes.

1335
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:43,670
After they used the fan heater,
you can all take out your ice.

1336
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,040
Ha Ha and Ye Eun,
please take out your ice.

1337
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,910
[The first winner
of the last mission]

1338
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,670
- It's pretty thin!
- We'll turn on the timer now.

1339
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,710
After five minutes,
the ice will be gone.

1340
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:58,560
- It's over.
- I'm sorry.

1341
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,240
They're so close.

1342
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,940
I think the key will be out
before we take out our ice.

1343
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,480
Jong Kook could have
taken out the key already.

1344
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,670
With his finger, he can lift it.

1345
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,760
[They're all gathered
around the heater.]

1346
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,710
- Move aside.
- I want to warm up.

1347
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,870
- It's pretty cold.
- This is for the ice.

1348
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:21,270
Now, take out your ice, Jong Kook.

1349
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,240
What if they key is out?

1350
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,010
- Jong Kook's key is deep inside.
- It's true.

1351
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,080
Watch if Jong Kook press it
with his thumb.

1352
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,850
- He is pressing it!
- Don't do that!

1353
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,920
The key is standing vertically.

1354
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,120
What are you doing with your mouth?

1355
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,290
She's melting it with her breath.

1356
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,930
It's the first time
for Ji Hyo's couple.

1357
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:48,020
- Take it out.
- Look, it's the same.

1358
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,630
That's the ice age.

1359
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,300
[It is preserved well.]

1360
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,000
It's still in the ice age.

1361
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,440
Jong Kook, please don't touch it.

1362
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,240
- I'm just holding it.
- Your body heat!

1363
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,610
- I'm just holding it here.
- Think of your body heat!

1364
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,180
I'm just going to hold it.

1365
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,920
I think the time is up.

1366
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,120
Our ice is brand new.

1367
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,990
Ji Suk Jin's ice is like
a frozen cloud from interstellar.

1368
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,160
The ice age and
the interstellar.

1369
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,330
He never once took it out.

1370
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,670
I think Ha Ha will make it.

1371
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,400
Their key is near the surface.

1372
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,870
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:35,010
In 10 seconds,
the fan heaters will be off.

1374
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,780
- Let's do it!
- Nine, eight, seven...

1375
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:43,450
six, five, four, three...

1376
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,780
two, one!

1377
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:48,690
[Get the key in the ice!]

1378
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,120
Turn off the fan heater.

1379
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,360
Okay, let's do this!

1380
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,230
[What a tiny ice!]

1381
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,730
[We can win this!]

1382
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,730
We're doomed.

1383
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,770
[Heavy]

1384
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,340
What's this?

1385
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:11,380
Put the lid on.
[It's too heavy to hold it.]

1386
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,680
Flip the lid.

1387
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,310
Where is the key?

1388
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,680
It's so cold!

1389
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,550
[Show me the power of Mr. Capable.]

1390
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:23,720
[What do we do?]

1391
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,660
[Are they planing?]

1392
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,660
[Will it be Ha Ha's ice...]

1393
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:35,500
[or Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin's
smallest ice?]

1394
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,420
[It's neck to neck.]

1395
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,540
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun's key
is about to reveal.]

1396
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,740
- This is it!
- Where is it?

1397
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,350
[Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin
acquire the key.]

1398
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,920
[They will win when
they find the matching lock.]

1399
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,550
What's going on?

1400
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:58,650
It's Kwang Soo.
Kwang Soo must have gotten the key.

1401
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,290
- Kwang Soo has the key.
- Does he?

1402
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,100
[But he can't find the lock.]

1403
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,800
It's the wrong box.

1404
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,630
[We can't give up!]

1405
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,270
[Ha Ha and Ye Eun gets the key.]

1406
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:19,110
[Did he open the box?]

1407
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,540
[It ain't over 'til it's over.]

1408
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,610
- You opened it.
- He opened it.

1409
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,050
[Unlocked!]

1410
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,980
We won!

1411
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,420
[Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun Jin
are the final winners!]

1412
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:35,020
We won!
Yes!

1413
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,190
I just got the key...

1414
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:39,560
- It's over.
- I just got it.

1415
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,560
[Kwang Soo and Hyun Jin
were one step ahead.]

1416
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:45,140
[The atmosphere turned ugly
as soon as they won.]

1417
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,100
No one congratulates for us.

1418
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,140
We're far from winning.

1419
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,340
We were close!

1420
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:56,140
[The benefits of the previous mission
were the driving force of the result.]

1421
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,380
[Ten minutes under the sunlight.]

1422
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,450
[Melting in the water for 15 minutes]

1423
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,060
[Their ice got small
and it lead them to win.]

1424
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,000
The final winners are
Kwang Soo and Seo Hyun Jin!

1425
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,800
- Lee Kwang Soo...
- Kwang Soo won.

1426
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,240
- The prize is...
- Just give them some ice.

1427
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,900
Give them an expensive ice sculpture!

1428
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:28,840
Eat some fruits!
Eat lots of fruits!

1429
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,940
[Depressed Kwang]

1430
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:35,520
[Everyone else is happy to see
the fruit baskets.]

1431
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,520
Isn't that what we used
at the beginning of the show?

1432
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,990
As expected, that producer is cheap.

1433
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:46,090
I heard the prize is gold.
Am I wrong?

1434
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,630
Not today?

1435
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:51,630
Eating apples in the morning
is like eating gold.

1436
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,630
Yes, eat it in the morning.

1437
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,540
- Eat the gold.
- It's very nice.

1438
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,240
Here's a golden kiwifruit, too!

1439
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,710
[Everyone is congratulating them.]

1440
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,950
Kwang Soo, you've worked so hard.

1441
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:14,310
Anyway, today's winners are
Hyun Jin and Lee Kwang Soo!

1442
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:16,650
[Now, they're officially
congratulating.]

1443
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:20,190
[They are cool and attractive
like a vacation!]

1444
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:24,200
[Hope you keep rolling!]

1445
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,660
<i>[An invitation for
a mysterious game...]</i>

1446
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,840
<i>[And... Girls' Generation disappeared!]</i>

1447
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,340
<i>Tetris!</i>

1448
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,170
<i>[Have the girls been
trapped in the game?]</i>

1449
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:38,980
<i>[Working as game pieces
in Tetris game.]</i>

1450
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:44,150
<i>[Desperate effort for escape!]</i>

1451
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:47,680
<i>[The girls are tougher and uglier!]</i>

1452
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,720
<i>- Who did it?
- I don't know.</i>

1453
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,320
<i>It's like a zombie game!</i>

1454
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,660
<i>- I'm so scared.
- They're running toward us!</i>

1455
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:00,760
<i>[Will they be able to
get out of the game?]</i>

1456
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,390
<i>I want to escape!</i>

1457
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,280
'Welcome to the game world.'
