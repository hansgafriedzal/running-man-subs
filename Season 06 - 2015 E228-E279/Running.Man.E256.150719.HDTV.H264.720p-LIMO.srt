00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,150
[You've invited the main PD.]

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,460
[What's up?]

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,890
[I have something to tell you...]

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,670
[Yes?]

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,060
[I'm telling you this without
letting my parents know.]

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,400
[Wait, then are you...]

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,460
[Yes, you're right.]

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,550
[I have a wish.]

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,090
[Could you come over to my place?]

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,150
[Come over to my place.]

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,890
[One day...]

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,570
[a little boy sent a message
to the production crew.]

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,520
[The house that boy lives in]

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,810
[shows that he's a fan of 'Running Man.']

[Come Over To My Place.]

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,820
[A desperate struggle to
find the fan's house.]

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,690
[A cold-blooded fight for the fan!]

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,230
[Team Running Man]

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,200

[Baek Jin Hee]

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,200
Who is it?

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,840
[A touching race]

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,540
Maybe it's a little girl!

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,270
[For the one person.]

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,570
Which floor do they live on?

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,280
[The fan's identity that
surprised everyone!]

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,450
[Come Over To My Place.]

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,750
[A red carpet runway gives us a hint
about the celebs coming today.]

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,720
Flying is so much fun, as usual.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,090
It's a nice place.

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,930
Flying from my house to the
filming set is always nice.

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,730
Oh welcome, guys.

33
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,300
Why are there so many of
you piled into one helicopter?

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,700
Just buy your own.

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,370
[Just then!]

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,380
[Another star just landed!]

[Reborn into a
singer-songwriter, Jun K.]

[Deadly smile, Junho.]

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,060
Jun K!

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,700
[Sweet Thailand Prince, Nichkhun.]

45

Our 2PM!

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,020
[The runway seems full and complete.]

51
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,690
Jong Kook, you might have to
use some strength today.

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,030
[Full level workout presence.]

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,900
We need to use our strength today.

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,200
Did you come for Jong Kook?

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,100
[We'll show you today.]

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,470
It's going to be
six times harder today.

57
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,240
It's Ji Hyo!

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,280
Oh, Song Ji Hyo!

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,780

[Today, Blank Ji is teaming up with 2PM.]

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,770
Why did you put on so much perfume!

65
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,230
[Slightly self-conscious]

66
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,800
Is it the guest's perfume?

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,970
[Their hearts are pounding.]

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,540
She's over there!

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,980
[Faraway... another female passenger!]

70
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,380
- Be careful!
- Kwang Soo's already fallen for her.

71
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,150
Wow, Baek Jin Hee!

72
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,820
Baek Jin Hee!
[Really?]

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,790
[Pure and innocent, Baek Jin Hee.]

74
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,960
[Attacks a man's heart with her
lovely charm and innocent looks.]

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,930
[A lovely girl that attracts
the maternal instinct.]

76
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,040
[She's ready to show off
her charms on 'Running Man.']

77
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,910
[Jin Hee is on the team with
the 'Running Man' regulars today.]

78
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,480
- What's wrong with you guys?
- What, what?

79
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,250
Why are you looking over there?

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,990
- No, not at all.
- Do you know anyone here?

81
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,990
Kwang Soo.

82
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,960
- We filmed an ad a while back.
- Yeah, we did.

83
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,990
- When was it?
- Three years ago.

84
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,590
Three years ago?
You might as well be strangers.

85
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,500
Three years ago is a long time!

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,960
- Do you contact him, personally?
- No, I don't.

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,270
- No, no.
- Why are you denying so much?

88
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,470
Don't send him any texts either,
he'll misunderstand.

89
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,470
[Don't worry, I won't.]

90
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,910
Today, we will explain
the rules differently.

91
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,010
We're connected onto an SNS chat with
the fan that requested a fan meeting.

92
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,010
It was real.

93
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,050
Do I press 'Running Man' fan?

94
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,220
From now on, the fan will send you
the rules, through the messenger.

95
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,660
Today's concept is finding the fan.

96
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,440
You can't ask about the
name, age, gender, or

97
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,330
personal details because
they can become hints.

98
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh, they said 'hi Running Man.'

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh, it's actually live!

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,270
- Oh is it?
- Maybe they're young.

101
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,610
They're using slang.

102
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,380
Where's the emoticon?

103
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,580
[Somewhat stiff]

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,280
I need to send an emoticon!

105
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,580
- You're so slow!
- Give it to me!

106
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,980
I can't see.

107
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,790
Who is it?

108
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,320
Ask them if they have a boyfriend.

109
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Today's race is
'Come Over To My Place.'

110
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,160
Oh, we have to find their house?

111
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,270
[What kind of a person is our fan?]

112
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,040
[He always watched over 'Running Man.']

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,080
[You can find my house, right?]

114
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll give you a hint
if you win the game.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,250
Just tell them to send the
address on the navigation!

116
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,620
Ask them what game we have to play.

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,360
If you win the game,
I'll give you a hint.

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,130
Mister PD will tell
you the exact rules.

119
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,130
Mister?
They're probably young!

120
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,130
Ask them who they like the most?

121
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,600
I accidentally typed 'Girls Generation'
instead of 'are you a girl?'

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,240
I can't really see...

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,570
- Who do you like the most?
- Girls Generation!

124
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,580
He likes Mr. Yoo Jae Suk
and Mr. Big Nose!

125
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,250
He's probably old.

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,750
He's for sure an old man!
[See you later.]

127
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,490
[Fan left the chat.]
They left!

128
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,120
It's because you said he wasn't a kid!

129
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Are they here?
They might be hiding!

130
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,160
I re-invited them.
[Why did you leave?]

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
He's older than me!

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
Junho invited him as soon as they left!

133
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,700
Junho's a little obsessive.

134
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,240
I'm so curious, but they won't tell me!

135
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,840
He's obsessive.

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,270
Today is the 'come over to my
place' race, like the fan said.

137
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,180
It's the 'come over to my place' race.

138
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,570
We will give you a hint
about the fan's house

139
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,810
every time you finish
the interim mission.

140
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,750
We will give a detailed
hint to the winning team

141
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,350
and a less detailed hint
to the losing team.

142
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,560
You will have to find the fan,
and give them a hug

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,890
to win the final mission.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,260
[If it's for the fan]

145
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,970
[we must run, run, and run some more!]

146
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,740
[The identity that shocked everyone!]

147
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,010
[Team Ji Hyo is driving
through Il San.]

148
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,410
If we go a little more, it's my school.

149
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,710
Where's your house?

150
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,350
Il San, near Jungbal Mountain.

151
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,220
We're going to meet a fan...
Is it your mother?

152
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,290
My mom?

153
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,860
- Is it Junho's mom?
- I hope not.

154
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,660
Let's go to Junho's house.

155
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,330
Are we going to win right away?

156
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,500
Would it be a celebrity?
I don't think it will be.

157
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,670
It could be a celebrity.

158
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,470
Really?

159
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,370
Jin Hee, what kind of men do you like?

160
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,070
Stop it!
[Giraffe's more curious about Jin Hee.]

161
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,140
Kwang Soo's hoping it would be him!

162
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,780
I like funny people.

163
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,850
[The entertainers are
greatly satisfied.]

164
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,820
You like funny people.

165
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,620
Who do you like from 2PM?
Like in order.

166
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,760
- Based on their looks.
- They're all good looking.

167
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,730
If I was a girl, I'd pick Woo Young.

168
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,730
I'd pick Taecyeon.

169
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,360
- I'd pick Junho.
- Me, too.

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,430
- Hold on, if I were a girl...
- You don't have to pick.

171
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,870
[They're talking about imaginary
2PM boyfriends on the way.]

172
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,650
[They've arrived at the mission site.]

173
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,080
[What will the first mission be...]

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,320
[to find the fan's house?]

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,690
[Ta-da]

176
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,530
[What is this machine?]

177
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,430
- Is it a see-saw?
- It's a see-saw.

178
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,630
[It looks like a machine
NASA would use.]

179
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,200
Ride it!

180
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,600
[They try the four-way
see-saw right away.]

181
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,370
[A see-saw's nothing...]

182
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,640
This is scary!
[Tremble, tremble]

183
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,050
You haven't had fun as a kid!

184
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,150
Isn't this having fun?

185
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,020
[The problem is that
you're having too much fun.]

186
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,160
Stop, stop!

187
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,860
[This is so much fun,
I'm going to die!]

188
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,590
[Shiver]

189
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,330
It kind of feels like riding a viking.

190
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,540
[Team Jin Hee also enters
the see-saw zone.]

191
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,100
This is no joke!

192
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,670
[The 2PM kids who are figuring out
how to play with their new toy.]

193
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,510
Wow, what is this?

194
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,910
- They made this just for the game?
- Isn't it obvious?

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,720
[Why would the city hall make this...]
Who else would build this?

196
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,350
Don't mock me!
You'll get in big trouble!

197
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,060
Welcome to the first mission.

198
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,960
This is your first mission.

199
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,930
[The first start to finding their fan.]

200
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,830
[It's the see-saw
name tag elimination.]

201
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,300
- Pardon?
- Name tag elimination?

202
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,930
How would you rip a name tag on that?

203
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,500
[The game everyone has
once dreamed of!]

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,610
Behind you, is a four-wheel see-saw.

205
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,040
Four members from each team will sit.

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,210
The females on each team will

207
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,920
rip off four name tags in
the shortest amount of time.

208
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,750
[The name tag reps are
Jin Hee and Ji Hyo.]

209
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,760
The team to rip off all the name tags in
the shortest amount of time will win.

210
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,690
The men have to properly

211
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,360
adjust when to lift their feet off.

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,100
The reps have to take the least amount
of time, using whatever method...

213
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,170
You said 'whatever method', right?

214
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,040
[What are you planning on doing...]

215
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,850
Don't give her a cause.

216
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,650
Don't let her grab our hair.

217
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,720
[The will to fight is
charged to the max.]

218
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,750
- We won!
- Look at her...

219
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,890
What do I do...

220
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,290
[Nobody knew up to this point.]

221
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,090
[How brutal these two females were...]

222
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,230
- Do rock-paper-scissors.
- Oh, to choose who goes first?

223
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,720
- To choose the four members.
- Oh, the four members.

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,030
You can win with scissors.

225
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,030
[Very startled]

226
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,350
[Big Nose, what did you just do...]

227
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,170
She was really startled just now!

228
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,770
I thought you were going
to kiss her cheek!

229
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,260
I gave her a hint on what to play.

230
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,770
Jin Hee isn't familiar with you yet!

231
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,890
I almost took you down!

232
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,570
[He almost got a take down
for trying to whisper.]

233
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,470
You almost got elbowed!

234
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,270
- I'll give you a signal next time.
- Do you know what he said?

235
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,630
'You can win if you play scissors.'

236
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,630
[He always talks about scissors.]

237
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,090
- Do we go first if we win?
- No, you choose who goes first.

238
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

239
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,970
[She lost with scissors!]

240
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,460
[She lost with Big Nose's scissors.]

241
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,490
- You can do it!
- Nice, nice!

242
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,570
[See-saw name tag elimination,
first round.]

243
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,180
Jin Hee, don't let them win!

244
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,750
- Throw away your smile!
- Don't show your teeth!

245
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,460
What do I do...

246
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,600
- We're starting.
- Good luck, Jin Hee!

247
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,430
Good luck!
[Round one, start!]

248
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,290
Lower him!

249
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,260
Jin Hee!

250
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,920
[No matter how hard she tries...]

251
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,030
[how are you going to rip anything
off with those delicate hands...]

252
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,630
[Open back]

253
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,630
[What are you doing?]

254
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,460
[She aims for your back
with her delicate hands...]

255
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,460
[Oops]

256
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,570
[We thought her hands were delicate,
but they're like hooks.]

257
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,350
[Admire, admire]

258
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,320
[The next target is Ok's back.]

259
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,360
[Her non-stop hunt.]
[She rips off Woo Young's right after.]

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,550
[Woo Young's name tag, clear.]

261
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,200
[The only name tag left is Chansung's!]

262
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,670
That's it!
[It won't budge!]

263
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,860
[The Ok stake.]

264
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,950
[I can live only if you stay there...]

265
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,430
[Ok-ay.]

266
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,170
[Struggle]

267
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,170
Jin Hee!

268
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,320
[I never clung onto anything before...]

269
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
No!

270
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,370
[She finally got rid of the Ok stake.]

271
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,530
Hold on just a minute!
Hold, on!

272
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,950
You can't do this, it's dangerous!

273
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,120
It's actually very dangerous!

274
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,690
[Surprise attack]

275
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,630
[That was close...]

276
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,630
Jin Hee!

277
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,000
Like now, like now!

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,950
I think we won!

279
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,520
[Jin Hee is squeezing
the last bit of energy.]

280
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,690
[How dare you!]

281
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,860
Chansung, you've done enough.

282
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,290
[Awkward]

283
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,030
[Ha Ha crushed his mentality.]

284
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,490
[Finally Chansung's
name tag is eliminated.]

285
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,580
But why did you do this?
What are you going to do about this?

286
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,170
[Back split]

287
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,200
It's like the awards ceremony.

288
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,890
If he does it, it's fashion.

289
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,760
Wow, that was amazing.

290
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Ji Hyo, good luck!

291
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,430
[See-saw elimination round one,
Ji Hyo's turn.]

292
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,350
[If those hands are hooks,
these hands are a bulldozer.]

293
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,030
- Don't sit too close.
- You and I need to balance properly.

294
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,800
Oh my god!

295
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,230
Wait, don't move so fast!

296
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,000
- Don't move!
- This is no joke.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,350
It looks easy.
If he goes there, I'll sit.

298
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,770
[Really?]

299
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,230
Let's do well!

300
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,750
[Ace Blank Ji vs. Running boys]

301
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you ready?

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
[See-saw elimination, round one.]

303
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,630
Good luck!

304
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,770
Hold on, hold on.
Is anyone filming Jae Suk?

305
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,010
Did you just see?

306
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,690
Chan Hee just said
'Is anyone filming Jae Suk?'

307
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,770
Chan Hee loves me so much.

308
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm disappointed!

309
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,170
[Why are you disappointed...]

310
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,770
[I only look at Jae Suk.]

311
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm so jealous...

312
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,550
Ready, start!

313
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,230
[Team Ji Hyo, start.]

314
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,400
[Sorry, but I have in front of me...]

315
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,630
[The Kkuk lump!]

316
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,370
[So... what?]

317
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,350
[Ultra-speed drop]

318
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,860
[Oh my]

319
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,920
[Giraffe's name tag is destroyed
as soon as round one started.]

320
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,720
[Now it's time for
grasshopper hunting.]

321
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,350
Wait, wait!
You can't!

322
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,830
[Rip]
Ji Hyo!

323
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,550
[Deeply moved]

324
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,550
[Now it's time to play with Kkuk.]

325
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,230
Jong Kook!
[If you slightly push Kkuk down...]

326
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,430
[It's hell here.]

327
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,890
Jong Kook!

328
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,320
[This is how she deals
with his resistance.]

329
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,630
[The tiger escaped!]

330
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,230
[Smashing the watermelon]

331
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,320
[A slam dunk on his butt crack...]

332
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,750
You can't do that!
[Rip]

333
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,200
[She got rid of Kkuk's name tag!]

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,460
[The last one is Gary's!]

335
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,330
[Tremble]

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,230
[Good job Ji Hyo!]

337
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,260
She's a monster...

338
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,950
[I knew she was scary,
but I didn't know it was this much...]

339
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,600
There's no reason for the see-saw!

340
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,060
What's the point of a see-saw?

341
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,190
[Blank Ji's success using
whatever method she wanted.]

342
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,290
Baek Jin Hee got

343
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,860
two minutes and four seconds.

344
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,830
Song Ji Hyo got

345
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,090
one minute and four seconds.

346
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,460
This time, a male rep
is going to eliminate.

347
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,150
You can't grab the see-saw
but you can grab other opponents.

348
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,800
- You can't touch the...
- Jong Kook's our rep.

349
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,350
Jong Kook can actually grab people.

350
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,950
[He's skilled at grabbing?]

351
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,350
Is it okay to come down
because you're scared?

352
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,090
[I'll save you...]

353
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,490
They might ask to come down.

354
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll rip all of them.

355
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,490
Jin Hee, just think of Kwang Soo
like a rock.

356
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,400
Jin Hee, I need to go up for defense...

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,260
Kwang Soo, just sacrifice yourself!

358
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,550
Just think of Kwang Soo

359
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,470
as a property.

360
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,290
[Defense role, stake role.]

361
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,770
Think about the time!

362
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,950
We just need to stall!

363
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,600
[See-saw round two, start!]

364
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,460
- You're doing well!
- That's it!

365
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,890
That's good!
He's stuck!

366
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,090
[Giraffe's name tag is cleared.]

367
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,600
[Next is Big Nose's turn.]

368
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,260
[He cleared Big Nose's in a flash.]

369
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,720
Oh right, I can't touch the see-saw!

370
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,400
[Pull]
Jin Hee!

371
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,280
[She's a Jin Hee-us.]

372
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,350
Wow, you're good!

373
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,570
[He changed his target to Ha Ha.]

374
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,030
[Raising the spine]

375
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,560
[Ha Ha, you're cool!]

376
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,750
[He's completely prohibited
from ousting...]

377
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,700
[Pull]

378
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,720
[He's allowed to grab the opponent...]

379
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,000
[Extremely embarrassed]

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,520
[The only one left is the Jin Hee-us.]

381
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,570
This is...

382
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,770
[Catch me if you can!]

383
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,490
[He approaches the see-saw
without touching it.]

384
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,920
[I'm coming!]
With your foot, avoid him!

385
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
[Crush]

386
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
[The taste of hell.]

387
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,800
[Shake, shake]

388
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,120
[The pain only men know.]

389
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,290
[Giraffe has his head down low.]

390
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,920
Jin Hee!

391
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,000
[His sliding show his fighting spirit.]

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,970
[Will he rip it off this time?]

393
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,060
[Next time!]

394
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,230
[Good job, leader!]

395
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,890
[He watches for a chance!]

396
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,890
[He succeeds at the surprise attack.]

397
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,690
[She got robbed right after
hearing compliments.]

398
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,260
[Taecyeon finishes the
mission with difficulty.]

399
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,860
Why did you high five?
You lost!

400
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Taecyeon is upset!

401
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,660
[Taecyeon is mad!]

402
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,920
Can I least wear a diaper or something?

403
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,970
Prepare an adult diaper!

404
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,260
[Will Kkuk be able to break
Taecyeon's record?]

405
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,970
I can't grab the see-saw, right?

406
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,320
It's okay
for a little bit of blood, right?

407
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,830
- Just slightly is okay, right?
- They all have to clothes on, right?

408
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,470
- Good luck, my team!
- Yeah!

409
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,870
- Kim Jong Kook, good luck!
- Good luck!

410
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,080
[I will show you what hunting is.]

411
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,680
[I miss my Mommy...]

412
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,180
You guys are dead.

413
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,950
[See-saw round two, start!]

414
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,490
[Rip]

415
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,960
[Roar]

416
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,300
[The tiger stalks his prey on the tree.]
Don't do this, Jong Kook!

417
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,070
[Why are you in such a hurry?]

418
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,210
[The tiger heads towards
his last prey.]

419
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,520
[He ripped all four name tags.]

420
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,920
[This is all part of nature.]

421
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,560
What is this!

422
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,690
There's no point!

423
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,730
Why did you make the see-saw?

424
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,540
It's as if the tiger stalks his prey...

425
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,660
We acted too rashly.

426
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,200
We shouldn't have planned a strategy...

427
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,660
Taecyeon's record is 01:49.

428
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,520
Jong Kook's record is

429
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,800
29 seconds.

430
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,690
[You're incredible...]

431
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,060
It was 29 seconds?

432
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,950
It took longer than we expected.

433
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,860
Try harder!

434
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,400
- You need to try harder!
- Sorry.

435
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,490
We actually had a strategy...

436
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,720
There's no use.

437
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,830
It's now tied.

438
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,770
We're going to play the last round.

439
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:48,460
You can't touch the see-saw or climb it
but only eliminate the name tags.

440
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,200
Anyone can be the rep
except the members who

441
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,950
have already been the rep.

442
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,890
[Team Jin Hee votes
Kwang Soo unanimously.]

443
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,120
- It's your time, now.
- It's time for the giant.

444
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,460
Instead, can we do this
if we're up there?

445
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,150
- You must be sitting.
- Sitting?

446
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,000
What were you doing before?

447
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,290
Were you sitting or standing?

448
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,660
[His humiliating
confidence over his hips.]

449
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,800
There's only a point in sacrificing
if you do it like Jin Hee!

450
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,770
[I don't think we'll be able to
see Ha Ha in the last round...]

451
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,430
[Time for strategy]

452
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,890
[The last defense is Blank Ji, Jun K]

453
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,200
[Taecyeon, and Junho.]

454
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,790
Kwang Soo can jump really well...

455
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,150
- Stay close to the handle.
- You have to avoid him.

456
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,920
- You have to avoid him.
- Stay close to that.

457
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,930
[Strategy planner Junho,
and commander Jun K.]

458
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,060
The ones on the bottom
will die for sure...

459
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,150
With Kwang Soo's height,
he can reach without jumping.

460
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,890
He'll reach if he jumps.

461
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,630
Chansung's really strong.

462
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,730
I can't touch it, anyway.

463
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,890
Jin Hee, did you wear
something underneath?

464
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,000
Did you wear something underneath?

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,290
[What did you say?]

466
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,590
[Shy, shy]

467
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,360
What are you saying!

468
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
- Why are you checking?
- Just in case it rips by accident...

469
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,630
You guys are really something else!

470
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,830
- So what if she is or isn't?
- You're really harsh.

471
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,940
[Falsely accused]

472
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,410
Are you ready?

473
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,340
[Round three, Chansung start!]

474
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,030
[He's attacking grasshopper first.]

475
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,170
Go forward!
[Rip]

476
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,950
[Grasshopper's name tag, cleared!]

477
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,750
[He goes up just in time.]

478
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,030
[Your sense of rhythm is perfect.]

479
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,720
[He avoided quickly... what?]

480
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,750
What is this?
[A free delivery service?]

481
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,860
[Grasshopper's off-beat.]

482
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,270
What are you doing?

483
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,550
Wasn't it three quarter time?

484
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,290
[The capable tiger vs.
Young champion wrestler Chansung.]

485
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,690
[Strength vs. strength]

486
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,920
[Risky, yet exciting]

487
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,290
Wow, that's amazing.

488
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,090
[Now the only one left
is the Jin Hee-us.]

489
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,890
I can't see clearly...

490
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,970
What do I do...

491
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,970
[Good job, you're stuck!]

492
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,950
You're doing well!

493
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,660
[Avoid, avoid]

494
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,230
That's good!

495
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,600
- Taecyeon's eyes!
- Why?

496
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,570
Those lustful eyes!

497
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,630
I'm just observing, that's all!

498
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,320
That's it, slap his hand away!

499
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,120
[Invincible defense]

500
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,490
[Even brushing past a
person is one's destiny...]

501
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,490
They're going to fall
in love at this rate.

502
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,370
You're right, you're right.

503
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
[Oh my god!
Her clothes!]

504
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,570
[Big accident]

[The prophecy, Ok-stradamus.]

[Did you take revenge for Nichkhun?]

514
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,200
Go over there.
Over there!

515
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,120
Taecyeon, are you happy?

516
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,600
- You go over there!
- Jin Hee, are you okay?

517
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,260
Yes, I'm okay.

518
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,950
We've timed it up to here.

519
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,060
Kwang Soo, why did you
take your clothes off?

520
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,060
[Awkward]

521
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,830
[You didn't have to do that...]

522
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,400
- Do we look that filthy?
- I was just trying to cover...

523
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,150
Why did you automatically strip!

524
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,570
He just wanted to
protect Jin Hee, but...

525
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,470
You've been really conscious
about it nowadays!

526
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,230
- You've done enough!
- I wasn't conscious!

527
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,630
He always does this
in front of the camera!

528
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,000
This is the last round.

529
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Kwang Soo will be our rep.

530
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
Chansung's record is

531
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,350
isn't very good, to be honest.

532
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,490
Chansung's record isn't good.

533
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,800
What's worse than Chansung's record

534
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
was the situation.

535
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,520
[He was confronted by catastrophe.]

536
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,300
Isn't he the first idol?

537
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,260
[You need to reflect on your actions.]

538
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,320
- Kwang Soo!
- Yes!

539
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,150
Ready, set!

540
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,810
[Round three, Kwang Soo start!]

541
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,320
Good, good!

542
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,200
Wow!

543
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Giraffe's next target is Taecyeon.

544
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,920
[We said no touching, but...]
Grab him, grab him!

545
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,630
[He does some wrestling skills
he always wanted to try.]

546
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,750
What are you doing?

547
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,350
[Stop sticking your butt out!]

548
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,880
[He's completely hiding his
name tag in this situation.]

549
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,890
[Fumble, fumble]

550
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,030
[Let's flip him!]

551
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,520
Kwang Soo!

552
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,920
Kwang Soo, you're doing well!

553
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,030
[Will he flip, or will he not?]

554
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,630
[Give up.]

555
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,550
[Jun K wasn't paying attention.]

556
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,770
[He attacks Blank Ji
as soon as he rips Jun K's.]

557
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,290
[Catch me if you can!]

558
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,240
[Collecting hair]

559
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,030
Sorry, sorry!

560
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,570
I'm really sorry!
I was trying to grab your clothes!

561
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,290
[Have you been hit
with a see-saw before?]

562
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,320
You can't touch!

563
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,970
[He pulls on Blank Ji's clothes.]

564
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,750
You can't!
Ji Hyo, bend over!

565
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,520
- Bend over!
- You can't grab her!

566
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,260
[Struggle]

567
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,060
[What?]

568
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,750
[Why did this...]

569
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,860
[We told you to rip name tags,
not clothes!]

570
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,690
- Why did you rip that off?
- He's weird!

571
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,230
[That's like the ace!
She's still calm after]

572
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,060
[her clothes ripped.]
He's impure!

573
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,660
- Good job!
- What are you doing?

574
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,630
- Kwang Soo!
- I'm getting so frustrated!

575
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,200
- Good, good!
- When did he eliminated them?

576
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,570
Didn't he eliminate
Tae Yeon's name tag?

577
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,100
[I have to attack
since there's no time!]

578
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,040
[He's not going to...]

579
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,410
Wait, wait!

580
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,150
This is a torture!

581
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,950
[Win or lose?
It depends on Taecyeon.]

582
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,950
- No!
- Good job!

583
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,420
- Hold it out!
- Kwang Soo!

584
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,130
[Roll]

585
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,070
[Team Jin Hee eliminates
all four name tags.]

586
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,540
[Dizzy, dizzy]

587
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
This is risky...

588
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,510
I'll announce the result.

589
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,540
I think we won, but...

590
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,710
Lee Kwang Soo's record
is two minutes...

591
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
It was more than two minutes.

592
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,890
And 24 seconds.

593
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,280
- One minute and 24 seconds?
- Two minutes.

594
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,210
Chansung's record is
two minutes...

595
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,630
and 15 seconds.

596
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,430
Wow, we won!

597
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,570
[They were nine seconds faster.}

598
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,870
We won!
[Team Ji Hyo vs. Team Jin Hee]

599
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,240
[Their flippant ceremony!]

600
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,340
[Bitter]

601
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,850
[While they're celebrating
their victory...]

602
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,850
Jin Hee is planning to sue you.

603
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,020
She's very much hurt.

604
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,260
[Always watch out for your back!]

605
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,160
Like I said before, the fan is
going to give you on the phone.

606
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,930
Write 'Team Ji Hyo won,'
then the fan will give you a hint.

607
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,670
Team Ji Hyo won.

608
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,480
You should at least show it to Jin Hee.

609
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,850
Congratulations!
The hint is about the pin number.

610
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,980
The pin code at my door is '?00?,'
and the two '?' are same numbers.

611
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,250
But we don't know where it is.

612
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,590
We'll get to know soon.

613
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,820
Did you get the hint?
Then, go to your car.

614
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,090
[Team Ji Hyo can go
to the next mission site.]

615
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,730
- We've sent the message.
- Let's wait.

616
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,770
Wait for the answer.

617
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,130
I thought Team Jin Hee was going to win.
Aw-shucks!

618
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,810
But I'll still give you a hint.

619
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,910
The pin code at my door is '?00?.'

620
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,440
[He doesn't let the two '?'
are same numbers.]

621
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,580
- Something, 0, 0, and something?
- 1004?

622
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,880
- '*00#'?
- '*00#'?

623
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,890
By the way, did you see
'Aw-shucks'?

624
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,220
- That's what we used to use.
- 'Aw-shucks'?

625
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,520
That's right!
We use it when we play pool.

626
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,060
When we almost hit the ball off
the table we used to say 'Aw-shucks!'

627
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,560
I'm pretty sure the person
was born before 1960.

628
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,470
- Let's go.
- 'Aw-shucks' is the 90's expression.

629
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,970
Guess the hint quickly
and meet me soon.

630
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,140
[Who is the fan who says 'Aw-shucks'?]

631
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,210
[Finding the mysterious fan]

632
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,810
[The identity of the mysterious fan
is slowly revealed.]

633
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,440
[The closer they get to the fan
the more shocking it gets!]

634
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,920
It's unbelievable!

635
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,890
[Is it a pool?]

636
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,030
What a nice weather.
It's perfect for water games.

637
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,830
Isn't it amazing?

638
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,700
[There's something
that doesn't fit in the pool.]

639
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,470
What is it again?

640
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,240
It's dreadful...

641
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,210
It's a basketball hoop.

642
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,540
What are we going to play here?

643
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,490
What's that?

644
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,280
It's for dunk shot.

645
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,480
We're really bad at ball games.

646
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,150
We're hopeless.

647
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,420
That's why we're called beast idols.

648
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,290
Our hands and feet are like beast.

649
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,190
The second mission is
diving basket ball.

650
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,920
Diving basketball?

651
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Do a run-up on the springboard
and throw a jump shot.

652
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,330
[Huh?]

653
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,940
It's moving further.

654
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,480
[The hoop is moving away.]

655
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,150
[Can't we leave it in here?]

656
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,220
[I knew it.]

657
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,390
How far will it move?

658
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,320
- That's too far!
- How far will they move it?

659
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,660
[About 12 meters (40 feet.)]
They want us to dive.

660
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,900
We have no choice
but to get in the water.

661
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,600
The hoop goes up!

662
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,670
[About 6 meters (20 feet.)]

663
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,200
That's too harsh!

664
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,440
We need to shoot a bank-shot.

665
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,080
Jong Kook sucks at basketball.

666
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,410
He's bad at ball games.

667
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,420
[Should I show you all today?]

668
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,950
[Diving basketball]
[Team Jin Hee vs. Team Ji Hyo]

669
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,080
Good luck, Jae Suk!

670
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,970
[When it comes to basketball,
we automatically play this song.]

671
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,630
[The players are picked
by rock-paper-scissors.]

672
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,320
[Serious]

673
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,750
[Grasshopper shooter]

674
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,720
[Pros: Always calm.]
[Cons: Not a good basketball player.]

675
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,890
Don't think about jumping.

676
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,400
Only focus on the rim.

677
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,070
[The problem is
the rim is far and high.]

678
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,090
[Team Jin Hee's first shooter...]
[Grasshopper]

679
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,460
[He tries to loosen up by dribbling.]

680
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,920
[How long are you going to do that?]

681
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,610
- You're going to be tired.
- I can't move my legs.

682
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,800
[Totally agree.]

683
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,550
Jae Suk, be brave!

684
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,380
- I feel you!
- In my mind, I'm already running.

685
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,870
[Grasshopper gathers up his courage.]

686
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,890
Fight, Jae Suk!

687
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,470
[Now...]
He's going at it!

688
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,090
[The only thing I see it the rim.]
Go, Jae Suk!

689
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,860
Fly, Yoo Jae Suk!

690
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,320
[Grasshopper runs!]

691
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,150
[Run]
He's doing it!

692
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,530
[Will he be able to score
at his first attempt?]

693
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,350
[After the run-up,
he throws a jump shot!]

694
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,240
[He threw it!]

695
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,840
[He puts up with the diving
and shoots the ball.]

696
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,370
[The trajectory looks good...]

697
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,270
[Not really!]

698
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,880
[It wasn't even close!]

699
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,240
The wind makes the ball curve.

700
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,400
I didn't score?

701
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,000
[No, you didn't score.]

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,640
It's farther than I thought.

703
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,730
Jae Suk fell into water,
but no one cares about him.

704
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,430
He didn't score.

705
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,120
No one asks if he's okay.

706
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,950
It's fine.
Come back.

707
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,290
[He flew like a grasshopper]

708
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,920
[and fell meaninglessly.]

709
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,650
[Basketball is not my strong suit.]

710
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,170
[Team Ji Hyo's first shooter, Chansung]

711
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,030
Whoever scores will lead the team.

712
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,390
[Beast shooter, Hwang Chansung]

713
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,890
[Pros: He's strong.]
[Cons: He's only strong.]

714
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,920
[He starts off with
spinning the basketball.]

715
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,670
What?
He can...

716
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,430
- You're good with balls!
- Challenge!

717
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,000
Run slowly.

718
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,010
Don't be in a hurry!

719
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,920
Good luck!
[He runs with a serious face.]

720
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
[Startled]

721
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,380
[Slap]

722
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,450
[Startled]

723
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,840
[What is he doing there?]

724
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,790
Mister, we're trying to
play basketball here.

725
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,330
This is too tight.

726
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,060
[Chansung pulls himself together.]
Challenge!

727
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,440
[I won't be bothered
by any interference.]

728
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,840
Chansung!
Chansung!

729
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,910
[He ignores Giraffe and shoots!]

730
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,510
[Will he...]

731
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,120
[The ball flies in an arc.]

732
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,920
[Straight to the rim!]

733
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,720
[No goal!]

734
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,920
[It was at the right angle.]

735
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,590
[But a little short.]

736
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,670
[After throwing the jump shot,
everyone dives.]

737
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,090
Diving makes everyone nervous.

738
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,830
[Also, no one cares about
who fell into the water.]

739
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,550
Can we start over?

740
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,430
[He throws it like a NBA player]

741
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,240
[but he shootis like a girl.]

742
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:00,320
[Diving basketball]
[Both fail at the round one.]

743
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:07,550
[Team Jin Hee's leader's attack.]

744
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,330
[The little woman, Baek Jin Hee]

745
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,120
[Pros: Small but strong.]
[Cons: Not that strong.]

746
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,150
We'll make it closer
for female players.

747
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,720
Aren't you good at basketball?

748
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,570
Can you show me this?

749
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,890
Dribbling.
[Slow and weak]

750
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,860
I'm so sorry.
[Why did you ask me to do it?]

751
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,790
[Team Jin Hee's second shooter,
Jin Hee.]

752
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,720
Run, Jin Hee!
[She runs briskly.]

753
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,930
- You can do it!
- Go, Jin Hee!

754
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,350
[She throws the ball and disappears.]

755
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,270
[This isn't a shot.]
[She whipped the ball down.]

756
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,950
[I'm sorry I asked if
she was good at basketball.]

757
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,720
[Like the hoop is at the bottom.]

758
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,640
[She squeezed her eyes
and jumped into water.]

759
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
[I miss my mommy...]

760
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,370
[It's kind of fun
to mimic Jin Hee.]

761
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,070
[Everyone is mimicking her.]
It was a battle against herself.

762
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:30,210
[She comes out of water.]

763
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,880
- Was the ball close to the hoop?
- Yes, it seemed like it.

764
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,250
[It's the first time diving
and throwing a ball.]

765
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,290
[Diving basketball]
[Jin Hee fails at round two.]

766
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,460
[Team Ji Hyo's second shooter,
Taecyeon.]

767
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,930
[The beast shooter, Ok Taecyeon]

768
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,330
[Pros: Very athletic.]
[Cons: He has beast hands.]

769
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,430
- Taecyeon, you should do it.
- I'd like to.

770
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,970
For your persona, you shouldn't...

771
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,520
[He runs as if he's playing football.]

772
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,410
I think he will make it!

773
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,120
[A shot of a beast]

774
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,840
[Bounce]

775
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,270
[It bounced back
by the rim.]

776
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,770
[It was close.]

777
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,720
It was very close.

778
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,950
He said he's bad at it,
but he's still good.

779
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,690
[The closest shot of them all.]

780
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,860
- Do you want to go first?
- Okay.

781
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,030
[Team Ji Hyo's third shooter,
Jun K.]

782
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,640
[2PM's number one shooter,
Jun K]

783
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,910
[Pros: The strongest out of 2PM.]
[Cons: 2PM is bad at ball games.]

784
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,350
[He catches his breath
and runs briskly]

785
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,920
[and shoot!]

786
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,240
[It's at the right angle!]

787
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,890
[Did he score?]

788
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,200
[Scream]
No, he didn't make it.

789
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,380
[Huh? No goal?]
It was a little short.

790
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,260
[It seems the ball went into the rim]

791
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,920
[but the ball just hit the net.]

792
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,950
[No goal!]

793
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,120
- Didn't it go through?
- No, it didn't.

794
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,520
[Only if it was
just a little higher...]

795
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,720
If the ball went 5 centimeters farther,
it could have gone through.

796
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,790
That was so close.
[Aw-shucks!]

797
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,750
You're the basketball man.

798
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,900
You should score a goal.

799
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,860
[At that moment,
a man picks up the ball quietly.]

800
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,570
[Who's the man?]

801
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,470
[The basket man Ha Ha!]

802
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,320
Dong Hoon will score a goal!

803
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,570
[Say my name, who am I?]

804
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,210
[Hichael Jordan, Ha Ha]

805
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,820
[Pros: Good basketball player.]
[Cons: Short stature]

806
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:03,220
[I'm not going to lose at basketball!]

807
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,870
[Because I'm the basket man!]

808
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,440
[He was born to play basketball.]

809
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,690
- Wasborn Basketball!
- Hichael Jordan!

810
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,520
The pantsless basketball man!

811
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,030
[Huh?]
[Oh, we get it.]

812
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,630
He scores by taking off his pants!

813
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,120
- He's confident about his skills.
- I think he will score for sure.

814
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,550
[Ha Ha's never this serious.]

815
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,150
Let's go!
[The basket man's attack.]

816
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,720
[Haroro's shot!]

817
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:41,240
[The shot flew in the highest
and the prettiest arc.]

818
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,150
[Wow, it's awesome!]

819
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:59,150
[The goal was a little off
from the hoop.]

820
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,470
It was the closest
out of the whole team.

821
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,820
[Yes, I'm Haroro.]
I think I can make it in my second try.

822
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,640
[Team Ji Hyo's last shooter.]

823
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,820
[All-around athlete, Nichkhun]

824
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,720
[Pros: He's good at everything.]
[Cons: ...]

825
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,060
Nichkhun, you're not going to
be good at this, are you?

826
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,060
You already have everything.

827
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,210
You don't need to be good at this.

828
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,870
He looks like he's playing volley ball.

829
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,000
[He's really fast!]

830
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,320
[He has the ability to react instantly.]

831
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,470
<i>Nichkhun crossed the river already.</i>

832
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,550
[He even has endurance.]
[All-around entertainer, Nichkhun!]

833
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,690
[Will he conquer
the diving basketball as well?]

834
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:51,240
[Runs without hesitation and shoots!]

835
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,720
[Look,
how the all-round entertainer plays!]

836
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,210
[Home run!]

837
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,070
[The ball headed to the sky.]

838
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,800
He made a poor shot.

839
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,070
It was our worst shot.

840
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,060
Oh, my Khun...

841
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,920
You ruined your carefully crafted imaged.

842
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,350
He's usually very athletic.

843
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,090
He's really bad.

844
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,520
He looks like
a prince of basketball.

845
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,890
The prince of Thailand
is not good at this!

846
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,270
This won't do.
Let me finish this game.

847
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,870
It's the last player.
You can finish the game!

848
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,350
- Go, go!
- Fight, Jong Kook!

849
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,430
[Team Jin Hee's last shooter,
Kkuk]

850
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,950
[The muscle shooter,
Kim Jong Kook]

851
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,690
[Pros: Limitless capabilities.]
[Cons: There should be...]

852
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,870
Let's go back a little.

853
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,180
[He's Mister Capable,
but bad at ball games.]

854
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,120
[He's shaky.]

855
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,550
- Don't you need to throw like this?
- His throwing motions is weird.

856
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,260
[These people...]

857
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,320
[should I really show them?]

858
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,770
I'll score a goal.

859
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:13,000
[I still believe in you.]

860
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,040
- I will score a goal.
- Please.

861
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,240
[Babe Kkuk is making a prediction?]

862
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,210
[The Tiger leaps.]

863
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,550
[His left hand...]

864
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,070
[is not just there,
but helps with the shot.]

865
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:38,580
[Kkuk's frog shot!]

866
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,950
[No way...]

867
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,840
[Please, go in!]

868
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,920
[It went through the net!]

869
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,570
- He scored!
- That's amazing!

870
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,830
[His motion was a little clumsy
but the ball went through the hoop.]

871
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,090
[Kkuk made it!]

872
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,030
[Team Jin Hee wins
the diving basketball.]

873
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,670
[With this, Mr. Capable
conquers ball games.]

874
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,970
I think I would hate him
if I was his enemy.

875
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,070
But it's nice to have him on my team.

876
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,270
[He keeps his face calm.]

877
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,770
[Absent-minded]

878
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:28,780
Let's play the name tag elimination!

879
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,660
[He jumped like a frog]

880
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,270
[and shoot to the hoop!]

881
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,530
[Of course, I'm a genius.]

882
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,410
This time, you'll get
hints on the phone.

883
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,520
You'll be able to talk to
the mother of the fan.

884
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,100
Mother?

885
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,030
We can guess from her voice.

886
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,150
You can't ask the address.

887
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,860
She'll only answer yes or no.

888
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,400
Ask as many questions
during the given time.

889
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,320
[Team Jin Hee has 30 seconds.
And Team Ji Hyo has 15 seconds.]

890
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,120
Hello, ma'am.

891
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,600
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

892
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,570
[She is the mother...]

893
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,470
[of the mysterious fan.]

894
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,720
[She looks very young
for a mother.]

895
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,350
[But, she looks familiar...]

896
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,410
By any chance, is your son in his 40s?

897
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,880
No.

898
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,120
- In his 30s?
- Jin Hee!

899
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,630
[It's like letting the other team
know the answer.]

900
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,720
- Is he an entertainer?
- No.

901
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,520
- Do you live in Seoul?
- No.

902
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,060
- Time is up.
- Is he married?

903
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:03,490
[This will be the last question.]
No.

904
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,430
[Team Jin Hee's time's up.]

905
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,640
[Did they get all the information
they wanted?]

906
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,410
You have 15 seconds.

907
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,270
Hello.

908
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,030
Is your child a son or a daughter?

909
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:19,970
She can only say yes or no.

910
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,150
Is your child a son?

911
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,010
- Yes.
- Five, four, three...

912
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,630
- Is he a singer?
- No.

913
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,430
Goodbye.

914
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,070
[Team Ji Hyo's time is up.]

915
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,150
[Finding the mysterious fan]
[The pin code of his door is '*00*.']

916
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,170
[The fan is a child,
and not a entertainer!]

917
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,770
What did Jin Hee ask?

918
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,550
He's a boy.

919
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,980
He's not an entertainer.
He's not in his 40s.

920
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,810
Maybe his mother is an entertainer.

921
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,880
It's possible.

922
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,660
Is she No Sa Yeon?

923
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,630
No, it wasn't her voice.

924
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,200
How was her voice?

925
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,430
- She sounded young.
- Young?

926
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:08,380
- Does she sound like in her 30s?
- Yes, between 30 to 40.

927
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,070
- She sounded...
- The the fan might be a student.

928
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,720
- Didn't she say he's in his 30s?
- She said he's not in his 40s.

929
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,670
So, we don't know how old he is.

930
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,950
Wake up, we're here!

931
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,800
What's that?

932
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,260
What is it?

933
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,320
[Huh? What is that?]

934
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,860
[All kinds of makeup]

935
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,830
[and a snugly teddy bear.]

936
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,830
[This is Hallyu actress
Blank Ji's house.]

937
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,750
[On the other side]

938
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,110
[a rising actress, Jin Hee's house.]

939
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,350
[In front of the two rooms]

940
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,090
[filled with luxurious items are...]

941
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,090
[a super-sized rice paddy.]

942
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:14,230
[The last mission of
'Come Over To My Place'!]

943
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,900
I left 'Three Meals a Day'.
But I still came to the country.

944
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,200
[It's a good place to build a house.]
What is this?

945
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,440
[What will be the last mission
that they will play?]

946
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,210
This is your house.

947
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,750
It surrounded by the rice paddy.

948
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,410
You're amazing!

949
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,920
This looks like a set
for the music show.

950
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,550
[They start looking
around the house.]

951
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,890
I've never seen so many
spring onions before!

952
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,890
[Just for one day,
I'd like to be the bed in your room.]

953
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,450
These are all spring onions.
[Farming instinct.]

954
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,730
Let's go.
[Team Jin Hee arrives at that moment.]

955
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,930
Is this a house?

956
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,940
- It's Jin Hee's house.
- Ji Hyo's house.

957
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,810
[Have your own house
by the spring onion field.]

958
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,440
- The last mission is...
- What is it?

959
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,450
'Why did you come to my house?'

960
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,850
<i>Why did you come to my house?</i>

961
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:14,250
Who to attack first will be
decided by rock-paper-scissors.

962
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:20,130
Offense team will decide
whose name you'll call.

963
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,130
When the game starts, you'll hold
your hands with your teammates.

964
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:27,430
Start singing the tune
'Why did you come to my house?'

965
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,800
and move while facing each other.

966
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,900
After you sing the part,
'What flower are you looking for?'

967
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,340
Then, offense team will call out
the name you decided.

968
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,280
From that moment, the offense team

969
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,120
needs to oust the person by
taking off one of the person's shoes.

970
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,220
Defense team needs to protect the
person whose name is called out.

971
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,840
If you protect the person,
you'll win the round.

972
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,950
Winning at rock-paper-scissors
is important.

973
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,090
Please play rock-paper-scissors.

974
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,730
Rock-paper-scissors!

975
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,530
Rock-paper-scissors!
Rock-paper-scissors!

976
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,670
Rock-paper-scissors!
[Jin Hee wins.]

977
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,000
[Team Jin Hee is on offense.]

978
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,940
- Very good!
- Did you win by throwing scissors?

979
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,800
[Good job!]
It's okay.

980
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,470
Don't worry about it.
[Team Ji Hyo is on defense.]

981
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,290
We'll block them.

982
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,210
- Who should we call out?
- They're all strong.

983
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,400
How about Nichkhun?

984
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,640
Let's pick the strongest one first.

985
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,400
Between Taecyeon or Chansung.

986
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,690
- Chansung will be hard to attack.
- I'll attack.

987
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:36,210
Once your name is called out,
that person goes to the back.

988
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,170
And the rest can fight them.

989
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,670
But, we need two people
to block Jong Kook.

990
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,690
No, we need three people.

991
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,070
[That's right...
Jong Kook is on that team.]

992
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,440
<i>[We still remember
the Idol Athletic Competition.]</i>

993
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,640
<i>[Nichkhun was ousted in a flash.]</i>

994
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,060
<i>[He also overpowered Jun K.]</i>

995
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,950
<i>[And ousted Woo Young
mercilessly.]</i>

996
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,730
<i>[Monster Kkuk made
the beast idols look like pets.]</i>

997
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,810
[It still chills down my spine.]

998
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,750
[Why did you come to my house?]
[The first round]

999
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,800
[The players enter the field.]

1000
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,010
Go to that side, okay?

1001
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:26,290
Did offense team decide on
who you'll attack?

1002
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,860
Yes.
[Wobble]

1003
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,490
[She feels weak
after the diving basketball.]

1004
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,640
Are they wearing shoulder pads or what?

1005
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,990
[Six men with big shoulders.]

1006
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,970
- Focus, focus!
- Get ready!

1007
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,890
I'm very nervous!
[Who will receive the last hint?]

1008
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,440
- They'll be even more nervous.
- Start!

1009
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,090
<i>Why did you come to my house,
to my house, to my house?</i>

1010
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,060
[Little by little]

1011
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,550
<i>To look for a flower,
a flower, a flower.</i>

1012
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,460
[Startled]
Don't we need to move back and forth?

1013
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,980
[They can't move forward.]
Let's do it again.

1014
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,750
[We know the rule...]

1015
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,170
We're scared, that's why!

1016
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,120
Think about it,
wouldn't you be scared?

1017
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,530
You need to meet someone like you!

1018
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,100
You know it hurts
to lock my fingers with him.

1019
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,440
- I have to endure it.
- We'll start again.

1020
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,110
<i>Why did you come to my house,
to my house, to my house?</i>

1021
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,680
<i>To look for a flower,
a flower, a flower.</i>

1022
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,610
[Can't you look for it slowly?]

1023
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:39,050
<i>What flower are you looking for?</i>

1024
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,950
One, two, three!

1025
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,240
Taecyeon!

1026
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,060
[Gosh!]

1027
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,500
[Taecyeon is cornered.]

1028
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,470
[Junho and Nichkhun
are blocking Jong Kook.]

1029
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,970
[The rest are one on one,
as they planned.]

1030
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,510
[Give me your shoe, Taecyeon!]

1031
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,380
[At that moment...]

1032
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,380
[Kwang Soo attacks Taecyeon's shoe.]

1033
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,250
[Let me see your sole.]

1034
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,220
[Big Nose attacks the other foot.]

1035
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,860
[Here's Taecyeon's shoe!]

1036
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,870
[Team Ji Hyo's member,
Taecyeon is ousted.]

1037
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,870
[Rip]

1038
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:39,580
What's wrong with this shirt?

1039
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,870
[The trace of the battle.]
What's wrong with this?

1040
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:50,090
[Suddenly, so sexy.]

1041
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,720
[The strongest member,
Taecyeon is ousted.]

1042
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,230
- Then, we only have six members.
- There's nothing you can do.

1043
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,980
[He made his own uniform
with a yellow plastic bag.]

1044
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,770
They don't have any extra uniforms.

1045
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:14,040
- They don't have anymore yellow shirts.
- This looks bad.

1046
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,540
[The yellow plastic bag
is what completes his fashion.]

1047
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,860
They don't have any!

1048
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:24,720
I think it'll be ripped
as soon as we touch it.

1049
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,420
If you win, attack him first.

1050
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,860
This makes our team look very weak.

1051
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,130
You looks like a mischievous boy.

1052
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,730
[Why did you come to my house?]
[The second round]

1053

[Chansung vs. Jin Hee]

1054
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,670

[Chansung wins.]
[Team Ji Hyo's offense..]

1056
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:48,780
You should have thrown scissors.

1057
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,380
[Ode to scissors]
[Ji Scissors-win.]

1058
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,110
- Team Ji Hyo, did you decide a name?
- Yes.

1059
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:57,140
We'll start the round two!

1060
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,750
[Why did you come to my house?]
[The second round starts.]

1061
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,850
<i>Why did you come to my house,
to my house, to my house?</i>

1062
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,930
<i>To look for a flower,
a flower, a flower.</i>

1063
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,000
<i>What flower are you looking for?</i>

1064
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,670
One, two, three?
[Who is their first target?]

1065
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,670
Kang Gary!

1066
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,580
[He runs away with all his might.]

1067
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,850
[Junho throws Mr. Capable.]

1068
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,820
[Stop there, Gary!]

1069
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,260
[He's been running away
for five years.]

1070
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,330
[Let me protect you, Gary!]

1071
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,030
[Grab]

1072
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,570
[Team Ji Hyo captures Gary.]

1073
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,810
[Chaos]
Endure it, Gary!

1074
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,510
- I took it off!
- No!

1075
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,690
We got it!

1076
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,820
[Woo Young got Gary's shoe!]

1077
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:13,060
[Team Jin Hee's member,
Gary is ousted.]

1078
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,630
Don't take off my shirt!

1079
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,930
[It's 2PM's turn to
take off their shirts.]

1080
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,540
What is this?
What kind of a game is this?

1081
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,350
This show is testing our patients!

1082
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,070
[It was a sudden exposure,
but their six-packs are firm.]

1083
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:38,070
- It feels weird.
- Give us four blue plastic bags, please.

1084
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,600
[Just look at me
and style like me.]

1085
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,120
- Look at Chansung.
Chansung, are you a warrior?

1086
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,440
[He recreates '300' poster.]
[Even the top looks like a cape.]

1087
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,150
What's wrong with this?

1088
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,720
Why don't you use this style
for your next album cover?

1089
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,040
[Isn't it nice?]

1090
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,970
[I support the album cover idea.]

1091
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,860
The score is 1:1.
You'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1092
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,320
- Reps!
- Suk Jin, you go!

1093
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,600

[Chansung vs. Big Nose]

1095

Rock-paper-scissors!

1096

[Chansung wins.]
[Team Ji Hyo is offense team again.]

1097
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,590
- I lost by throwing scissors.
- Why do you always throw scissors?

1098
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,550
[Whisper, whisper]

1099
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,870
[Team Ji Hyo decided quickly.]
The third round, ready!

1100
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,150
<i>Why did you come to my house,
to my house, to my house?</i>

1101
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,800
<i>To look for a flower,
a flower, a flower.</i>

1102
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,400
<i>What flower are you looking for?</i>

1103
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,350
One, two, three!

1104
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,440
[Who's their target?]

1105
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,120
Ji Suk Jin!

1106
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,690
[It's unexpected!]
[They picked the weakest.]

1107
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,150
[Big Nose gets caught by Junho.]

1108
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,000
[Scream]

1109
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,970
[Big Nose's crisis!]

1110
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,060
Run, Suk Jin!

1111
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,640
Suk Jin!

1112
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,800
[Do you think it's possible to run?]

1113
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,830
Suk Jin!

1114
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,660
- Hold my shoes!
- I'll hold them.

1115
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,170
Hold it just for a moment!

1116
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,400
[Suk Jin, endure it!]

1117
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,170
Just for 30 seconds!

1118
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,660
[Team Jin Hee can win if they
keep his shoes for 30 seconds.]

1119
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,720
Keep your toes wide open!

1120
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,690
[My toes... hang in there....]

1121
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,260
I'm getting the cramps!

1122
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,600
My toes!

1123
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,860
My big toe!

1124
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:55,040
Ten seconds left!

1125
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,170
I have the shoes!

1126
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,170
- It's almost done!
- Stay strong!

1127
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,630
I have the shoe!

1128
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,970
Don't let him hold it up!

1129
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:08,720
[Team Ji Hyo will win
if Chansung hold up the shoe.]

1130
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,670
Two, one...

1131
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,890
[Big Nose's toes endured hardship.]

1132
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:29,520
- I had the shoe.
- You didn't hold it up.

1133
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,980
[Team Jin Hee wins.]

1134
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,030
Wow, unbelievable!
[Bravo! Enthusiastic Big Nose!]

1135
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:39,610
Suk Jin, you did well!

1136
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:43,620
Jong Kook was on top of me.
How can I possibly hold it up?

1137
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,970
- Who can defeat him?
- Did you see it?

1138
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:50,520
Look at my shirt.

1139
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,230
[The see through plastic bag
is fashionable and strong.]

1140
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,320
Did you see it?

1141
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,150
[Team Ji Hyo vs. Team Jin Hee]
[1:1]

1142
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:03,150
Mr. Ono-no-Tofu is walking around!
(A man with an umbrella on Hanafuda)

1143
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,690
[Mr. Ok-no-Tofu]

1144
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:09,230
Ono-no-Tofu,
why are you walking around?

1145
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,410
I want to protect my members
from the sun.

1146
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,870
Jin Hee, come to your senses!

1147
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,830
[They won again!]

1148
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,200
[They lost again!]

1149
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,890
You should have thrown
scissors in the beginning.

1150
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:30,060
You're really lucky today.
Two out of three, please!

1151
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,950
Let's do best out of three!

1152
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,490
- Let's start deciding.
- Jin Hee is asking you.

1153
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,270
Look at Jin Hee.

1154
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,800
[Please...]

1155
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,120
Just look at her.
[Best out of three?]

1156
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,070
[Yes, best out of three!]

1157
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,090
Okay, let's just do it.

1158
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,660
[Her cute appeal worked!]

1159
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,720
- So, it's two out of three.
- Okay, good!

1160
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,640
He won once already.
[1:1]

1161
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,290
Okay, okay!
[Slap]

1162
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,490
[He won five times and lost once.]

1163
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,630
I won all the other games!

1164
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,260
It just once!
I'm hurt!

1165
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,920
[I apologize.]
Jin Hee, just win one more time.

1166
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,860
Rock-paper-scissors!

1167
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,780
[Let us attack once!]

1168
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,570
[Chansung wins.]
[Team Ji Hyo is on offense again.]

1169
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:41,880
[Thanks to Chansung, Team Ji Hyo is
on offense four times in a row.]

1170
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:48,260
I'll tell you who the target it.
I can see it from here.

1171
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,080
- How do you know?
- I can see it.

1172
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,030
It'll be over, if we lose this time.

1173
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,370
It's true. [They whisper
from where Gary can't see.]

1174
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,200
[Huh?
Who is it this time?]

1175
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,400
Ready, set, go!

<i>What flower are you looking for?</i>

1179
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,950
One, two, three!

[I'm sorry, I don't know this time.]

[Don't worry, Kwang Soo!]
[Let me protect you.]

[Thud]

1189
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,310

to use your technique!]

[No way!]

Kwang Soo is ousted.]

[Team Ji Hyo wins the last mission.]
It's over.

1197
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:34,350
We lost because of
the rock-paper-scissors.

1198

[They were on offense once,
then the rest was on defense.]

1199

We won!

1200
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,100
- You've worked so hard, Jin Hee.
- How many rounds did we fight?

We'll give you the last hint

It's the address.

1206

The mud stain is hard to get rid of.

1207

Here, I'll give you the last hint.

1208
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,280

01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,180
[4th City street,
Goyang City in Gyeonggi]

1212
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,770
[Come quickly.
I'll be waiting for you.]

1213
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,240
I think it's pretty close.

1214
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,500
Did we get it?

1215
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,370
- Did we get it?
- Yes, we did.

1216
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:36,610
[City street, Ilsan-dong,
Goyang City in Gyeonggi]

1217
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,910
This is my address!

1218
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,450
[That's the area I live!]

1219
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,490
[Did he say he lives there?]

1220
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,120
[Team Ji Hyo gets in the car quickly.]

1221
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,190
I've got a very important information.

1222
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,980
It's possible the fan is Suk Jin's son.

1223
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,190
What?

1224
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:02,580
[The fan might be Big Nose's son?]

1225
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:07,570
That's why he said he likes
Jae Suk and Big Nose?

1226
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,460
Is that really your address?

1227
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,550
- I think it is, don't you think so?
- Where is it?

1228
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,690
Didn't I say it's hard to find
a fan of Suk Jin?

1229
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,290
[It's suspicious.]
That's right!

1230
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,150
He said he likes me and Jae Suk.

1231
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:28,350
We should have asked him who he dislikes.
Hyun Woo dislikes me.

1232
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:31,830
- Even you don't know about this.
- Of course, I don't know.

1233
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,700
- Could it be?
- I was talking to my wife a moment ago.

1234
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,170
Why don't you call her back
so Jin Hee can hear her voice.

1235
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:43,980
Call her and let her listen.

1236
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,580
- That's amazing.
- You can tell, right?

1237
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:53,150
- She's busy.
- Maybe she's on the phone with the PD.

1238
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,390
Could it be really your house?

1239
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,420
Could it be?

1240
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,330
No way, it doesn't make sense.

1241
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:09,770
[Both teams are heading to
the area in a hurry.]

1242
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,580
[It's a battle of speed!]

1243
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,930
[The team that gives the fan
a hug first will win this race.]

1244
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,040
[What's the identity of the fan?]

1245
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:24,250
[They are near the area.]
I can't believe it's my house.

1246
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,580
A lot of celebrities
live in this area, right?

1247
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,190
Right, there are many celebrities.

1248
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,490
- But he's not a celebrity.
- Perhaps...

1249
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,160
[Perhaps?]

1250
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,060
It could be Jun Soo.
[Lee Jong Hyuk's son.]

1251
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,630
Jong Hyuk's family
lives one floor above us.

1252
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:46,370
- But she said he's not a celebrity.
- His son is not a celebrity.

1253
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:49,910
Right, the fan must be a child.

1254
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,580
But think about 'Aw-shucks.'
[They arrive at the building.]

1255
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,770
Suk Jin's son would write, 'Aw-shucks'?
That doesn't make sense.

1256
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,950
No way...

1257
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:05,280
Could it be really my house?

1258
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,980
[They arrived at Suk Jin's apartment.]

1259
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,650
This doesn't make sense!

1260
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,060
This is unbelievable!

1261
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,860
[He hurriedly returns home.]

1262
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,700
- Why doesn't this work?
- Suk Jin, are you flustered?

1263
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,730
[He seems very flustered.]

1264
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:26,170
[They reached Big Nose's elevator.]

1265
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:29,470
Is it really our house?

1266
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:32,440
This is unbelievable.

1267
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,850
[There are cameras in
the elevator as well.]

1268
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:42,380
[It can't be...
Let's go to my house first.]

1269
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:45,120
[They got off on Big Nose's floor.]

1270
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,620
[They arrive in front
of Big Nose's house.]

1271
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:51,260
[As usual]

1272
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,430
[he tries pressing]

1273
01:11:55,430 --> 01:12:01,370
[the password to his house.]

1274
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:04,470
Huh?
It changed!

1275
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,770
[But it's my house...]

1276
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:10,110
[Mental breakdown]

1277
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:14,710
You're the house owner,
just tell your wife to open up.

1278
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,480
[They changed the password!]

1279
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,920
[Suk Jin's house is mostly
likely the fan's house.]

1280
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,420
Please press the password.

1281
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,560
She said press the password.

1282
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,800
Are you going to be like this?

1283
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,860
[Suk Jin's house is the fan's house?]

1284
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,700
Honey... Soo Jung.

1285
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,670
[Honey, please open the door.]

1286
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:43,110
[We must have failed...]

1287
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:47,000
They changed the password.

1288
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,480
Only you can solve it.

1289
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,580
It must have a meaning to you.

1290
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:55,720
Ask your wife for a hint.

1291
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,520
It's a really easy number.

1292
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,630
- Is it Hyun Woo?
- Yes.

1293
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:04,130
Would you give me a hint?

1294
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,200
- It's really easy.
- He says it's easy.

1295
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,200
[If it's easy, is it 0000?]

1296
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,640
Does that have a meaning to you?

1297
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,040
[Will that really be the answer?]

1298
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,040
[Press, press]

1299
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,750
[It opened]

1300
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:29,890
[They finally entered
Big Nose's house.]

1301
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,760
Is it really my house?

1302
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:39,200
[Then the fan waiting here is...]

1303
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:43,970
- He likes Big Nose and Jae Suk!
- He's older than me!

1304
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:47,000
[It was a difficult mystery at first.]

1305
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,810
[The fan's password is?00?
The?'s are the same number.]

1306
01:13:52,780 --> 01:14:00,280
[The closer and closer they got every
time they finished a round.]

1307
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,450
[The fan is a child!]
[Not a celebrity!]

1308
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,790
- They're not in their 40s.
- They're in their 30s.

1309
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,800
[They realized it was a
child near the end.]

1310
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,840
[The fan's house is in
an apartment in Il San.]

1311
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:26,910
[The mystery fan was
Suk Jin's son, Hyun Woo.]

1312
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:33,150
[Dad, I'm always your number one fan.]

1313
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,120
- It's really your house!
- Hello!

1314
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,400
- Hello!
- Hello!

1315
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,200
[Ji Hyun Woo and Ryu Soo Jung.]

1316
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,920
Hello!

1317
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,490
Go hug him!

1318
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,660
Wow, that's amazing.
It was really my house?

1319
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:54,860
[Dumbfounded]

1320
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,570
I really didn't know...

1321
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:59,920
You were fooled!

1322
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,430
Then did you text them saying
you were a 'Running Man' fan?

1323
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,320
Yes.

1324
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,090
[You must be surprised.]

1325
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:18,170
[From the greeting at the
opening to the missions.]

1326
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:22,720
[Hyun Woo guided them
through the whole thing.]

1327
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,970
[The hints in the middle were
given by Hyun Woo as well!]

1328
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:32,320
<i>It's something, zero zero, something.</i>

1329
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:36,970
[In Suk Jin's home]

1330
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,460
[Hyun Woo had bits and pieces
of Running Man memories.]

1331
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,320
[And the unforgettable moments
he had with the members.]

1332
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:48,490
[Welcome, I was waiting for you.]

1333
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:51,030
Soo Jung!

1334
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:53,890
Aren't your clothes a bit excessive?

1335
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,860
[I wanted to look nice.]

1336
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,570
- I know this family really well...
- Hyun Woo, let me give you a hug.

1337
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,920
We have to hug.
[Come here, my number one fan.]

1338
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,610
[I thought you didn't like me]

1339
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:14,080
[because I couldn't
be with you enough.]

1340
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,230
[But I never knew
the mystery fan was my son.]

1341
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:20,550
Me, too.

1342
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,430
You made him breakfast this morning?

1343
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,370
It was weird.

1344
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:28,030
She usually sleeps past 9.

1345
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,970
She woke up to my alarm.

1346
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:33,920
[They've found the right place
thanks to Hyun Woo's text.]

1347
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,060
You left a message...

1348
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,550
[Oh!]

1349
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:42,230
Oh, they were already here!

1350
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:46,550
[Team Ji Hyo was already here,
but were hiding.]

1351
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,230
[15 minutes ago]

1352
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:52,230
[They knew the exact address, so they]

1353
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:53,600
[were able to come earlier!]

1354
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,890
- Are you wearing sunglasses inside?
- It's a child.

1355
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,290
It's child.

1356
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:03,490
By any chance, do you know if Suk Jin's
son lives somewhere upstairs?

1357
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,460
- The ninth floor?
- Which house?

1358
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,290
[He knew the exact house number!]

1359
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:14,920
[A kind boy who helped Team Ji Hyo.]
What floor do you live on?

1360
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,060
- The 14th floor.
- Are you close?

1361
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:24,260
- Uncle Suk Jin knows my dad.
- Is it this boy?

1362
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:30,650
Oh, this is Lee Jong Hyuk's son,
Tak Soo.

1363
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:35,060
Oh, I'm sorry.
How is your dad doing?

1364
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,970
[They thankfully got to the
right floor thanks to him.]

1365
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,150
[Surprised]

1366
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,120
Try '0000', first.

1367
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,710
Wow, that was amazing!

1368
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,770
For real?

1369
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,150
Excuse us!

1370
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,170
[Is it my dad?]
Please, excuse us.

1371
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:10,790
Hello, Soo Jung!

1372
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,570
[Peek]

1373
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:17,230
- Hello.
- Hello Soo Jung.

1374
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,230
Hyun Woo, it's you right?

1375
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,520
We have to hug him!

1376
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,660
[Team Ji Hyo won the final mission.]

1377
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,770
Hyun Woo!

1378
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,490
- Hyun Woo, did they hug you?
