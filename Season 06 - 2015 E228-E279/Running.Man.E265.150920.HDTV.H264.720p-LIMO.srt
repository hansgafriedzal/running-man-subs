[These people are coming?]
Wow, today...

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,670
Hello!

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,510

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,770
Hello!

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,170
Are you going sky diving?

[Giraffe's backpack
really stands out.]

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,270
[Is there a parachute inside?]
What are you taking about?

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,270
They told us to bring

- I was surprised to see the guest list.
- Who is it?

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,340
Please move over a little bit.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
It's a female guest!

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,440
Seeing how he's behaving,
it's a female guest!

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,940
Can I have high hopes today?

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,440
- Me, too.
- Yeah, Gary and I.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,610
Isn't it a little too late for you?

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,170
- Excuse me?
- You and Soo Hong, both.

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,210
How are we the same?
Our ages are different!

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,370
At least Soo Hong
knows how to have fun.

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,310
He goes to clubs, too!

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,200
- Where?
- A health club.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,810

29
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,970
His girlfriend's name is Protein.

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,440
- Proteina.
- Proteina?

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,510
[Mr. Capable's girlfriend,
Proteina.]

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,410
When you see them...
I can't believe they're really coming.

33
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,270
- Really?
- They need to gather together.

34
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,450
The one who always placed
first in school.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,940
He won the Minister award at Math
Olympiad when he was in high school.

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,840
And placed in first
among high school mathletes.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,170
The God of Math in the world of idols.

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,570
- Math?
- There's such a person?

39
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,570
- Super Junior's Gyu Hyun!
- Oh my, really?

40
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,070
[The hidden talent
of Super Junior.]

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,610
[Super Junior, Gyu Hyun]

42
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,170

[I will complete the mission
like the God of Math today!]

45
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,450
[The presence of an intellectual.]
Seriously?

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,010
[He looks different...]
Is he good at mental calculation?

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,510
Everyone looks at you
differently, now.

48
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,570
It said you got the Minister award
at the Math Olympiad.

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,070
But that was 12 years ago...

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,610
- I'm a little...
- But look at this!

51
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,870
His father said this
in an interview.

52
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,780
'He may not be a genius,
but he has a brilliant mind.'

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,640
[Embarrassed]

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,750
He didn't get in with special admission

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,170
but he entered Kyunghee University
with his SAT score.

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,670
- Yes, I did.
- Wow, that's incredible!

57
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,610
The Minister award!
We need to applaud!

58
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,770
Have you ever received
a Minister award?

59
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,270
There's such a person in the business?

60
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,610
Okay, next.

61
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,610
Wow, this person
is also incredible.

62
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,670
'I de-stress by studying.'

63
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,910
- Which member?
- There's such a human being?

64
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,010
She's never lost first place in school,
even with her tight schedule.

65
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,910
- I know this fact.
- Is it a sitcom?

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,840
Wonder Girls' Ye Eun!

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,960

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,470

00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,770
[Bookworm Ye Eun,
studies in the car.]

71
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,770
[Entered Kyunghee University.]

72
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,800
[De-stressing by studying
instead of sleep!]

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,940
[I will show you what
a smart idol is like!]

74
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,070
- Hello!
- Hi!

75
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,170
Hello.

76
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,640
[I didn't know Ye Eun
was that smart.]

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,310
Gyu Hyun is smart, too.

78
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,870
- It's famous that Ye Eun is smart.
- Not at all.

79
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,040
She used to study in the car
while 'Tell Me' was famous.

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,610
She really likes studying.

81
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,840
- Is it fun to study?
- I'm not good at math.

82
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
You guys should go out, then.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,260
[The God of Math is embarrassed.]

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,630
[He's upset at their superior DNA.]

85
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,830
Why are you being sarcastic?

86
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,700
This is her report card in her
second year of high school.

87
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,470
First place of 41 people
during midterms.

88
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,470
She placed ninth out of 605
people during finals.

89
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,740
She's really good.

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,150
And she got in Kyunghee University
with her SAT score.

91
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,610
You guys are a campus couple!

92
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,050
He was year ahead of me in school.

93
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,070
- Oh, you went to school together.
- I cherish her as a classmate.

94
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,640
Ye Eun and Gyu Hyun
are intellectuals.

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,670
I can listen up to this point.

96
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,840
- But the next...
- Who is it?

97
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,570
He has an IQ of 138

98
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,370
and is an economics major
at Northwestern University.

99
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,710
One of the top schools in America.

100
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,870
Starting from entering in the
top ten on America's idol.

101
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,270
- Who is it?
- 'Kwang Soo-like Eyes'?

102
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,940
Lastly, we have the
Blue-chip entertainer.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,210
- John Park!
- John Park... really?

104
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,050
Park!

105
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,770
Kwang Soo!

106
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,040
[The intellectual from overseas,
John Park.]

107
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,770
[On American's largest
audition program]

108
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,370
<i>['American Idol']
My name is John Park</i>

109
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,540
<i>I am a student, but I could be
the next American Idol.</i>

110
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
<i>Welcome to the top 24.</i>

111
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,670
[Attending
Northwestern University.]

112
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,970
[Kim Tae Hee: 'I want to study
English with John Park.']

113
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,610
[The true golden boy in this era.]

114
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,340
[Intelligent and qualified,
The Golden Boy is here!]

115
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,510
Hello!

116
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,410
John Park is very smart.

117
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,510
I heard it's easy to get into
University in the States.

118
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,210
Graduating is hard!

119
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,510
- Did you graduate?
- I'm on a leave of absence.

120
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,340
See, graduating is hard!

121
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,240
You have to graduate
to prove that you're smart.

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,770
In Korea, we get a direct
call from school saying

123
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,740
- 'it's better to dropout...'
- To see if you really want to study.

124
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Just to explain a little bit

125
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,400
his IQ is 138.

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,070
There are a few who are higher.

127
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,340
It's not really special.

128
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,670
You should at least be in Mensa...

129
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,780
Take care of your
bare skin (mensal).

130
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,820
[What's wrong with my skin...]

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,310
- Take good care.
- I'll take care of it for you.

132
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,410
- Northwestern, economics major?
- Yes.

133
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,170
- Wow, really?
- That's unexpected.

134
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,240
I actually got into University through
an audition with singing.

135
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,270
Economics major
with singing?

136
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,740
You could do a double major
with economics and music.

137
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,870
It was a five year program.

138
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,040
But since I got in with singing

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,770
I think they let me off the hook
with my GPA.

140
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,010
[So does that mean
he didn't really study?]

141
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,170
Didn't you mis-cast him?

142
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,910
But anyway,
we have John Park here.

143
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,170
[Who's the last intellectual?]

144
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,590
I never knew, but this guest
has so many accomplishments...

145
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,130
[Who is it?]
I was so surprised.

146
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,130
A monster who kept their top
one percent rank in the Nation.

147
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,630
His IQ is 148.

148
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,570
Is there a real
monster coming out?

149
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,800
His IQ is 148!

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,310
A language genius that mastered
English and Japanese.

151
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,440
This era's hottest
and sexiest brain!

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,610
Rap Monster from Bangtan Boys.

153
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,010
Hello!

154
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,620
[BTS, Rap Monster]

155
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,940
[Rap Monster's SAT score ranked
in the top one percent.]

156
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,440
[Brain Monster... sexiest brain.]

157
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,760
[I'm here to conquer 'Running Man'!]

158
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,770
- Hello!
- Rap Mon!

159
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,700
He looks so different, now!

160
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,410
Now that I look at him!

161
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,610
Rap Mon looks so smart!

162
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,610
- Is your IQ really 148?
- I only scored that once, in high school.

163
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,540
That's enough!

164
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,940
We can't get 148!

165
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,770
We won't get that number even
if we take the same test twice.

166
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,150
That's almost my height!

167
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,340
Even if you show us the answer,
we still won't get 148.

168
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,710
- Even if you show us...
- Is it really 148?

169
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,040
He maintained in the top 1.3 percent in
language, math, foreign language, society.

170
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Wow!

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,770
He got a score of 850 on TOEIC
in middle school by studying on his own.

172
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,870
That little...

173
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
That little?

174
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,070
Please be careful what you say!

175
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,180
[Ha Ha gets upset with
his qualifications.]

176
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,140
- Why are you angry?
- What's wrong with you?

177
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,210
Please introduce yourself,
in English.

178
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,640
[Dumbfounded]

179
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,890
Introduce yourself!

180
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,470
[He's asking the language genius,
with his elementary level English.]

181
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,470
We need to confirm if
he really speaks English!

182
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,740
Then confirm by
asking him in English!

183
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,410
- Rap Mon!
- Yes, sir.

184
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,570
Okay.

185
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,710
His pronunciation is amazing.

186
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,440
He studied hard.

187
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
Please give a round of
applause to the four guests.

188
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,540
[The smartest brains.
Fantastic Four.]

189
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,140
This is amazing!

190
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,950
I will give you the mission you'll
be doing with the smartest idols.

191
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,240
It's a survival race.
Escape from the desert island.

192
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,810
[Escape from the desert island?]

193
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,910
[Escape out of the desert island!]

194
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,770
Wow, do we have to use our brains?

195
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,470
I should get ready
to start farming there.

196
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,810
Just give Gary a tent
so he can sleep there.

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,970
John Park might not make it out.
[Please, don't say that.]

198
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,950
Just like it is called, you need to
escape from the island first.

199
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,310
[Escape the island with
the given missions.]

200
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,440
[In the extreme environment,
the survival mission is starting!]

201
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,410
[I want to get out of here so badly!]

202
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,740
[If you want to survive, move!]

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,570
[Will they be able
to escape safely?]

204
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,930
Who has a schedule
tomorrow morning?

205
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,900
Are we staying until the morning?

206
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,530
If you can't escape, you will have to
leave the island early in the morning.

207
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,100
[Early in the morning?]

208
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,970
If you have a schedule,
please adjust now.

209
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,240
Oh, we have to adjust our schedule?

210
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,010
Before you go, here is an item that
you need to survive on an island.

211
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,410
- A bottle of water.
- What is this?

212
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,340
Now you will do a test with
the production crew rep

213
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,940
- PD Lee Hwan Jin.
- You need to do an IQ test on him!

214
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,910
[He has a golden brain!]

215
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,640
You will need to do an IQ test
on the desk behind you.

216
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,640
How are we going to do an IQ test?

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,740
I didn't even sleep.

218
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,570
- I've got the brain of an anteater.
- A sloth, for me.

219
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,740
We're a sloth and an anteater.

220
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,140
You need to get a higher score than
the PD to get a bottle of water.

221
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,890
I will hand out a few cards.

222
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,060
You need to guess the order
and re-organize the cards.

223
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,140
She takes the basket... and chooses...

224
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,470
The second is a vocabulary test.

225
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,840
Write the definitions as quickly
and simply as possible.

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,070
This tests you on your
understanding and expression.

227
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,840
I will show you a
picture for the third test.

228
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,210
You need to arrange the
blocks to make it the same.

229
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,770
- This is hard.
- My head hurts.

230
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,020
In Korea, the average adult
drank 32 glasses of coffee in a month.

231
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,590
Then how many glasses does
one person drink in a year?

232
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,930
It's wrong!

233
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,900
[Rap Monster writes down the
answer as soon as he hears it.]

234
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,260
This is the last question.

235
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,100
Wasn't the last question number seven?

236
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,170
- It's seven, now.
- Yes this is the last question.

237
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,170
I think I skipped lines!

238
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,310
- Wait...
- I think I missed two questions.

239
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,240
Then what do I do?

240
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,910
[The bottle of water depends
on their test results!]

241
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,350
[What will their results be?]

242
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,750
Nice work, good job.

243
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,150
This is no fun!

244
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,020
I hope I don't get a low rank.

245
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's go!

246
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,140
I failed that question...

247
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,140
The people that I call out have
a higher IQ than PD Lee Hwan Jin.

248
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,370
If I don't get called...

249
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,640
It's only three people!

250
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,310
[Only three people will
get the bottle of water!]

251
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,910
One of the four failed!

252
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,310
[Worried]

253
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,410
[Who is the first one to
get the bottle of water?]

254
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,110
- John Park.
- Really?

255
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,690
[This is great!]
Seriously?

256
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,470
[How did this happen?]
It doesn't make sense!

257
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,810
[The IQ test result]
He's quick-witted.

258
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,640
He has a flexible mindset.

259
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,910
And he is very sociable.

260
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,670
- Sociability?
- How does the test show it?

261
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,410
He has a lot of potential.

262
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,470
The next person is

263
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,240
Gyu Hyun!

264
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,810
- That's not even weird.
- Go over there.

265
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,140
You're lucky, Gyu Hyun!

266
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,570
Gyu Hyun has really good concentration.

267
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,740
He also has great numeracy.

268
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,670
He has good abilities
for natural science field.

269
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,840
- He's cold.
- He has no affection.

270
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,460
[You're mistaken!]

271
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,010
And the last person!

272
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,010
Rap Monster!

273
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,810
Ye Eun, it's because
you didn't get any sleep.

274
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,470
- Yes, I am not a genius.
- It's because you got no sleep.

275
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,310
More than anything,
his language ability is excellent.

276
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,680
He's amazing.

277
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,550
Out of the eight of you

278
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,110
I'll name one the people
who got the highest IQ.

279
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,940
The highest person is

280
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,440
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Me?

281
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,970
He struggled, a lot.

282
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,810
Suk Jin is really disappointed.

283
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,470
All categories
were well balanced.

284
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,010
His focus ability was the best.

285
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,810
Then doesn't he lack
in every category?

286
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,470
[What?]
You sugarcoated it.

287
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,070
He's so-so.

288
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,840
- You only like him.
- You're generous to him.

289
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,270
We will give a bottle of water
each to those who scored higher.

290
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,770
You can't buy water there.

291
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,540
All the intellectuals are there.

292
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,110
[Let's still do our best...]

293
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,140
[It's my pleasure.]

294
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,640
We will now get on the boat
for the desert survival.

295
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,140
[It's finally time for battle.]

296
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,110
[If failure, they must take the
boat early in the morning.]

297
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,480
[Escape out of the island, today.]

298
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,220
Let go!
To the unknown island!

299
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,170
[The 11 brains are
heading to the boat.]

300
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,010
Ye Eun, come here.
And Park John.

301
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,870
Gyu Hyun, hurry up!

302
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,340
How many staff are with you?

303
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,830
- What are you doing?
- Film this!

304
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,030
How many staff are with you?

305
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,370
They can't even wear sunscreen,
yet they're applying it on him!

306
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,740
[Super Junior's face is worth it.]

307
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,440
If it's this size,
you won't get seasick.

308
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,040
[They got on board safely.]

309
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,370
[Finally, to the final location!
To the island!]

310
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,710
[What kinds of things will happen?]

311
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,470
Make sure to hold on to
your bottle of water.

312
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,240
I should have had some
water before I came.

313
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm thirsty now that I
think I can't drink any.

314
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,810
Do you tell us the missions
when we get there?

315
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,210
We don't even have name tags.

316
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,040
- You're right!
- That's true!

317
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,740
- This is the first time.
- Why, Ye Eun?

318
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,070
I just thought of
'The Hunger Games' all of a sudden.

319
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,040
The survivors disappearing
one by one?

320
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,540
Isn't that a little too much?

321
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,540
[Escaping the island makes me
think of all sorts of things...]

322
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,230
Could you tell us the
three lowest ranked people?

323
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,770
[I am curious, though.]

324
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,270
- Can I really say it?
- Yes.

325
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,670
Just tell us the surnames.

326
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,010
Lee.

327
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,970
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Am I the only one with that name?

328
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,770
Our surnames are all different.

329
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,110
The only one who has
Lee is Kwang Soo.

330
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,210
- This is another surname.
- Yes.

331
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,870
- Kang.
- Gary!

332
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,740
[Gary got selected.]

333
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,740
What's the point of surnames, then?

334
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,970
It's Lee Kang.

335
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,640
The last one.

336
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,840
Ha.
[Ha Ha got selected.]

337
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,940
[He asked for them...]

338
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,670
Lee, Kang, Ha!

339
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,910
[Lee Kang Ha trio]

340
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,740
[We are brothers.]

341
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,270
How did you all sit together?

342
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,270
Should we ask about the lowest?
I'm so curious!

343
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,260
They're more curious.

344
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,110
I don't have pride.

345
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,900
I joked around during the test.

346
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,610
- The lowest?
- Yes.

347
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,010
Don't get shocked.

348
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,940
We've done it a lot before!

349
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,270
[The lowest ranked IQ?]

350
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,770
- Ha!
- Yay!

351
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,040
[Running Man's official no-brainer]

352
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,870
Kang, Lee, Ha!

353
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,370
[Happy vs. sad]

354
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,940
I'm the highest out of the three!

355
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,040
[I hope there isn't anything
to do using our brains...]

356
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,470
[The boat heads
further into the island...]

357
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,760
Is this really the order?

358
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,410
But is it really true that we
might not leave the island?

359
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,610
It's like I've told you before.

360
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,010
You either come out today or tomorrow.
It's one or the other.

361
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,170
I bet it's going to be tougher later,
seeing how we're comfortable now.

362
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,440
[Are we really leaving
tomorrow morning?]

363
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,170
Everyone's face...

364
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,770
I have to finish recording my album,
I have to come out today!

365
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,940
You really need to get out.

366
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,800
I will give it my all.

367
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:46,640
[Will they be able to
safely leave the island?]

368
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,810
[That is how]

369
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,850
[they spent an hour on the boat.]

370
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,650
[Gets up]

371
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,190
It's actually a deserted island!

372
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,920
[Nervous]

373
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,690
- Are there any people?
- Guys!

374
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,030
There are people over there

375
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,500
but there's nothing there.

376
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,910
It's just empty.

377
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,710
Is it really a deserted island?

378
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,470
It's my first time here.

379
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,810
I wouldn't come here.

380
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,640
In my entire life.

381
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,710
[What will happen to them?]

382
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,920
[They arrived at the island.]

383
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,440
From today, a human being
will start living here.

384
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,770
[As if it's hiding the
events yet to come]

385
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,090
[it's the calm before the storm...]

386
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,210
Do you come to
deserted islands often?

387
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,270
It's our first time.

388
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,330
It's a real tent!

389
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,570
[Is that where the disqualified
person will sleep tonight?]

390
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,740
Everyone's already tired.

391
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,070
[They're already so tired,
and the only thing]

392
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,770
[greeting them are... life jackets?]

393
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,440
I think our name tags are on that.

394
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,880
[There aren't any names on the tags!]

395
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Aren't those life jackets?

396
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,450
[When are we using that?]

397
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,420
- It's already scary.
- It's so hot.

398
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,510
- Everyone's here, right?
- Water!

399
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,410
- Please!
- I'm so thirsty.

400
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,410
Like I said before, it's a survival
mission on the deserted island.

401
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,940
There are life jackets beside you.

402
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,040
There's one for every person,
and there aren't any name tags.

403
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,770
If you complete your
name on the life jacket

404
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,640
you can escape.

405
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,610
[You cannot escape unless
you have your entire name.]

406
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,870
The current time is 11:44 a.m.

407
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,040
Starting now...

408
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,140
we are going to collect your
phones and watches.

409
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,770
[Even our watches?]

410
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,440
If you put your bag down,
we will also take it for now.

411
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,500
Listen carefully.

412
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,240
Six p.m. is when there's a high tide,
and it'll be hard to sail.

413
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
So we will send the last
boat out at 5 p.m.

414
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,450
If you don't get out by 5 p.m.

415
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,720
you need to sleep here and
leave early in the morning.

416
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,020
And just to let you know,
your name tag isn't just one piece.

417
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,240
You have to find all the vowels
and consonants in your name.

418
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,970
For example, for Yoo Jae Suk.
Y, OO, J, and then

419
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,340
'AE' is together.

420
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Then, 'S, U, and K.'

421
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,340
You must find all of them

422
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,410
and stick it on your life jacket.

423
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,070
Then, you will wear it and escape.

424
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,240
There are some people
who have nicknames.

425
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,910
You must find the letters
of your real name.

426
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,520
Ha Ha is Ha Dong Hoon.

427
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,090
Gary is Kang Hee Gun.

428
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,030
John Park is Park Sung Gyu.

429
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,760
Gyu Hyun is Cho Gyu Hyun.

430
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,560
Ye Eun is Park Ye Eun.

431
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,370
Rap Monster will be

432
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,670
Kim Nam Joon.

433
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,510
The current time is 11:48 a.m.

434
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,110
I will give you
exactly 30 minutes.

435
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,550
There are vowels and consonants
hidden just around you.

436
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,850
You may be able to get out.
I will give you 30 minutes, exactly.

437
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,820
- Is there only one per person?
- We need to search separately.

438
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,360
Where, where?
Which way is it?

439
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,260
- We need to find it!
- How do we find them?

440
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,100
- Oh, no...
- I need to find them!

441
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,610
[How are they going
to find such small]

442
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,370
[letters in this large space?]

443
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,780
Aren't there any rules?

444
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,050
We just start looking?

445
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,820
[Just like this!]

446
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,390
[Huh?
That is?]

447
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,020
[Giraffe finds a bag.]

448
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,720
[The letter inside is]

449
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,060
['K']
Okay!

450
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm going to get out for sure!

451
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,800
[They get them so easily.]

452
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,410
[Kkuk got 'J.']

453
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,980
I saw this tiny thing from
all the way over there.

454
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,480
I am so desperate right now.

455
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,250
[Ji Hyo got 'O.']

456
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,160
[He found two at once.]

457
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,830
[One is 'A' and the other is 'U.']

458
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
I should trade later.

459
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,340
What's up with me today?

460
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,640
I found 'K.'

461
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,650
Wow!

462
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,120
An enormous jellyfish!

463
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,120
[I'm getting a tan, go away.]

464
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,460
[Meanwhile]

465
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,960
Gary!

466
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,060
A, Y, G, R.

467
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,330
I'll give them all to you.

468
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,200
- Please give me some in Park Sung Gyu.
- Okay!

469
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,770
- Did you find them?
- Not yet.

470
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,380
- You'll give them to me later?
- Let's share later on.

471
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,680
- Ye Eun!
- First, have some water.

472
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,770
If we find some of each other's,
let's exchange.

473
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,560
But our letters coincide.

474
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,540
Then we'll keep those

475
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,650
and give the ones we don't need.

476
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,770
We're trading, okay?

477
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,840
- You can drink water whenever you want.
- Thanks.

478
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,370
- Just keep it.
- No!

479
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,810
- We have to trade, okay?
- Okay!

480
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,140
I think I can just take it easy.

481
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,550
[Gyu Hyun finds the bag first.]

482
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,640
- I found it!
- Wait, I found it first!

483
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,660
[Gyu got it first.]

484
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,210
[Gyu Hyun gets all of them
right in front of Kwang Soo.]

485
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,430
Listen to me, first!

486
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,310
- Yes!
- Wait, Gyu Hyun!

487
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,970
- Just check first!
- There are so many!

488
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,470
- Yes!
- Where is it?

489
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,670
I'm going crazy!
[Kwang Soo's about to cry.]

490
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,270
- There are so many!
- Gyu Hyun!

491
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,420
This is so annoying!

492
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,040
This is so annoying!

493
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,770
The letter is 'J'!
Oh Yay!

494
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,540
[They search, and search]

495
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,830
[and slowly build their names.]

496
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,970
[There's not much time left.]

497
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,470
[The 11 people are trying their
best until their last breath.]

498
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,540
[The 30 minute time limit is over!]

499
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,410
- Rap Mon found the most!
- He found nine!

500
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,070
Mine erased!

501
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,470
[Gary's letter disappeared.]

502
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,370
Mine erased!
How can this be, it's impossible!

503
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,070
- It actually erased!
- It really erased...

504
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,470
Please give me a 'G.'

505
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,410
I'll dance!

506
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,240
You're really desperate.
[I really need to get out today.]

507
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,970
Everyone, including me,
is very desperate.

508
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,840
- We're all desperate.
- What do you have tomorrow?

509
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,570
- To be honest, I have nothing.
- Then just stay here.

510
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,310
Just stay here.
What about you Ye Eun?

511
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,740
- I have a performance in Busan.
- What time?

512
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,510
I don't know what time,
but I have to leave early!

513
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,170
- Pass, pass.
- In Busan!

514
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,570
It might be faster to take
the boat here, to Busan.

515
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,360
I can call YP later,
because we're close.

516
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,170
- Do you have anything tomorrow?
- A meeting.

517
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,040
It's an athletic meeting, right?
Go over there.

518
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,110
How about you, Monster Rap?

519
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,070
Monster Rap!

520
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,040
What do you mean Monster Rap?

521
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,570
I'm a little crazy right now.

522
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,710
- Mon Rap.
- I miss my mother.

523
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,310
You can see her tomorrow.

524
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,470
- My mother's birthday is today.
- Really?

525
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,020
We're having pizza at nine.

526
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,940
<i>Happy Birthday to you!</i>

527
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,870
<i>Happy Birthday to you!
He can't come today!</i>

528
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,870
<i>Dear, Gyu Hyun's mother.</i>

529
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,810
<i>Happy Birthday to you!</i>

530
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,210
Please live a healthy life!

531
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,470
Recording.
I need to complete my album!

532
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,310
- Do you have to do it tomorrow?
- I have to finish tomorrow!

533
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,110
- Really?
- I don't have any other time.

534
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,770
What are you doing...
[Kiss]

535
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,170
- I'm very desperate.
- I think Gary's actually desperate.

536
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,390
[Whisper, whisper]

537
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,610
- What, what?
- She's so honest.

538
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,610
She needs to get skincare.

539
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,440
She's very honest.
We need to understand.

540
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,770
- I booked an appointment...
- It's really important!

541
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,870
I'll give you first and second.

542
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,040
- Skincare counts?
- Why?

543
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,840
- She's so honest!
- I need to get an insulin shot!

544
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,410
I actually have to go
to a charity bazaar!

545
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,450
- Let's exchange one.
- Then, he's done!

546
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,120
- He has a lot left.
- Which one do you need?

547
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,620
- I need two.
- Let's trade later.

548
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,730
I just need 'WA.'

549
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:57,030
Wow, this is nice.
[The current name tag situation.]

550
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,800
[Seeing now...]

551
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,340
Ji Hyo, you only need' H'!

552
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,870
[She collected
everything except 'H.']

553
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:11,280
It's currently 13 minutes before 1 p.m.

554
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,750
Time really passes slowly...

555
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,880
In about three and
a half to four hours

556
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,220
everything will be over
and whoever is left will stay.

557
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,790
Everyone can escape.

558
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,560
We have a bonus game
that could help.

559
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,930
It's called 'Guess the time.'

560
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,930
At any hour

561
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,330
you need to shout out the time with your
arms pointing like the needles in a clock.

562
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,640
Whoever guesses the correct time can
receive a letter of their choice.

563
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,270
This is why we took your
phones and watches.

564
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,910
<i>The girl who can't say good bye.</i>

565
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,450
The boy... this is 30 seconds.

566
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,550
[Human timer]

567
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,350
<i>The two of us are no longer in love
So no no no no no no.</i>

568
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,460
- I'll just keep doing this?
- Gary's so desperate!

569
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>The two of us are no longer in love.</i>

570
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,130
It's been a minute.

571
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,330
<i>So no no no no no no.</i>

572
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,110
[You're trying so hard...]

573
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,510
Dear Gods!

574
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,110
[Have we ever seen Gary
this desperate before...]

575
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,340
Gary really needs to go out!

576
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,270
Now, let's do the next mission!

577
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,940
This is a chance.

578
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,770
Whoever does this mission well

579
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:26,510
will receive any letter
of their choice.

580
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,440
- Okay!
- That's good!

581
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,610
You can obtain
a vowel or consonant

582
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,010
through a 'Telepathy Image Game'
with a citizen.

583
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,270
In Mokdong, Seoul, there are
miniatures of you and the island.

584
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,170
- It is everyone's miniature.
- Oh, yes.

585
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:53,480
Their order and your order
have to be the same.

586
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,050
Only one person will
get a letter of choice.

587
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,880
- But how do we guess?
- It's hard!

588
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,250
This is the first topic.

589
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,430
From smartest to stupidest,
determine the ranking.

590
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,130
Number goes up as it gets stupider?

591
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,400
Dong Hun!

592
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,500
Hello!

593
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,000
- Hello!
- They're on the screen.

594
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,980
Nice to meet you!

595
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Where are you?

596
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,110
- We're in front of SBS.
- In Mok-dong?

597
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,610
Thank you for your cooperation!

598
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,520
Thank you!

599
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,170
Who's your favorite celebrity?

600
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,670
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Me, too.

601
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,010
Most of all...

602
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,840
thank you for your time.

603
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Please determine the ranking

604
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,270
for being smart including
Running Man members.

605
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,170
From first to eleventh.

606
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,510
So, the stupidest person
will be ranked eleventh.

607
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,770
They know Rap Monster.
[The Image Game, begins!]

608
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:08,320
[How will they determine?]

609
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,540
Let's be rational.
They know Rap Monster.

610
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,940
- Rap Mon, Ye Eun, then Gyu Hyun...
- They don't know Gyu Hyun.

611
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,610
- Are you decided?
- No, no.

612
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,540
- Gary.
- I'll be the last person.

613
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,370
But people in their 20s like you.

614
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,970
Even the people who like Gary
don't like Gary for being smart.

615
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,040
I think Jae Suk will rank high.

616
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,840
- I won't rank first, though.
- Didn't you say you will rank fourth?

617
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,150
I think we'll be disappointed.

618
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,150
- You won't rank ninth.
- No one wants to be number 11.

619
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,220
I'll take it.

620
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,290
- No, Gary should take seven.
- Kwang Soo!

621
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,620
[Upset]

622
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,590
I graduated from a university, too!

623
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,700
Switch with someone
if you don't like it.

624
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,200
Gary might rank high, though.

625
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,600
No, they watch Running Man.

626
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,670
You can't change it.

627
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,940
It's determined.

628
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,040
We'll reveal the rank now.
One, two, three!

629
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,010
Who's number one?

630
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,680
Rap Monster!

631
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,550
[Correct]

632
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,820
That's reasonable.

633
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,720
Wow, I rank second?
Wow, Jae Suk rank second!

634
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,990
He's not that smart!

635
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm not very smart.

636
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
The third...

637
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,730
is Song Ji Hyo.

638
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,370
Ji Hyo ranks third?

639
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,400
[Ji Hyo ranks
a lot higher than ninth.]

640
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,140
- Oh my god!
- It doesn't make sense!

641
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,510
[They thought he'll be the last.]

642
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,770
It doesn't even make any sense!

643
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,780
Who ranks fifth?

644
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
[You look smart to me.]

645
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,350
John Park, he's correct!

646
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,850
He ranks fifth!

647
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,390
You scored, John Park.

648
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,620
- Who's next?
- Gary!

649
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,260
- I told you!
- We were going to switch!

650
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,800
See, you rank pretty high.

651
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,670
[And the sixth is Big-nose!]
If we have had switched!

652
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,800
Then, Ye Eun and Gyu Hyun...

653
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,110
My name is still not on the list!

654
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,510
[Gyu Hyun is the eighth.]

655
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,840
[The ninth is Ye Eun.]
Ye Eun ranks ninth.

656
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,010
They don't know about
Gyu Hyun and Ye Eun.

657
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,270
They don't know they're smart.

658
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,510
Kim Jong Kook ranks tenth.

659
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,240
I told you to stay!

660
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,110
Ha Ha is the eleventh.

661
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,010
I have nothing in my brain!

662
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,970
Why did you change it?

663
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,570
Many people know Rap Mon is smart
because of BTS show.

664
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,910
Rap Monster, we'll give you
a vowel or a consonant.

665
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,010
- I want an N for Nam.
- An N?

666
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,670
The ranking doesn't matter,
but I need to be correct.

667
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,910
- What do you want, John?
- I want a P for Park.

668
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,870
The next topic is...

669
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:08,270
The one will be able to survive without
a problem even on a desert island.

670
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,040
That's a given.
[Mr. Capable is number one?]

671
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,300
Come forward, Kim Jong Kook
and Song Ji Hyo.

672
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,840
Kwang Soo, you too.

673
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Hello!

674
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,540
- Hello!
- He might not know me.

675
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,080
Nice to meet you.
We're on a desert island.

676
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm a big fan of Song Ji Hyo!

677
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,340
You'll rank high.

678
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,750
From the strongest survivor
on a desert island to the weakest.

679
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,510
Please determine the ranking.

680
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,010
Think about the personas
of Running Man.

681
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,740
Then, start deciding.

682
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,740
I will rank low.

683
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,860
Jong Kook, you rank first.

684
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,310
Our images...

685
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,870
I think Ji Hyo will rank
either first or second.

686
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,970
Just go, you don't have to
give a little.

687
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,310
She might rank
higher than Jong Kook.

688
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,470
- I would be third?
- You'll rank third.

689
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,480
Jae Suk could rank second.

690
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,710
Jae Suk, get the third.

691
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,440
But he might put
Gary next to Ji Hyo.

692
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,870
Let's fix it.

693
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,270
- Are you decided?
- Yes, we are.

694
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,040
- Jong Kook is the first?
- Ji Hyo is the second.

695
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,540
- Wow, I've got it!
- Gary ranks first?

696
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,370
Because you're Monday Couple
with Ji Hyo.

697
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,270
He's a fan of Monday Couple.

698
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,870
This is unbelievable!

699
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,910
[Mr. Capable ranks third.]

700
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,070
The fourth is Ha Ha?

701
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,140
You're the fourth?
How?

702
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,070
How could I rank fourth?

703
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,560
[The fifth: Yoo Jae Suk]
[The sixth: John Park]

704
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,710
I think the seventh is Kwang Soo.

705
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,430
No, it's Gyu Hyun.

706
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,960
He's ranked pretty high.

707
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,870
The eighth is Ye Eun.

708
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,870
She's correct!

709
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,440
- Kwang Soo.
- Why am I ranked ninth?

710
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,870
The tenth...
[Rap Monster]

711
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,750
- Why do I rank tenth?
- Suk Jin scored it.

712
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,750
[The last person is Big-nosed Brother!]

713
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,720
Thank you so much!

714
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,790
Am I supposed to be happy?

715
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,040
You're lucky.

716
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,130
Song Ji Hyo, here's H for Hyo.

717
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,970
- Song Ji Hyo escapes!
- She's incredible!

718
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,810
She's lucky every time!

719
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,070
I envy her.
Gary...

720
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,840
- You rank pretty high.
- That feels nice...

721
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,810
but I didn't win any letter.

722
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,140
Still, your image is good.

723
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,640
I can escape now!

724
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,810
I was close...

725
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,370
Ji Hyo is really leaving!

726
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,570
Goodbye, Ji Hyo!
Share your luck with me.

727
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,230
[I'm going back to land!]

728
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,170
The weather is really hot.

729
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,510
I'm not joking.
[But I'm free!]

730
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,770
Why is she so lucky?

731
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,170
There are lucky people.

732
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,570
[Bye, Lucky Blank Ji!]

733
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,280
Phew.

734
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,180
It feels really good.

735
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,850
But I feel a little lonely
without the members.

736
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,310
More than anything, I'm excited
that Gary doesn't know anything.

737
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,540
[What is she talking about?]

738
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,240
[Is there something Gary doesn't know?]

739
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,630
I'm sorry, Gary!

740
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,870
[Let's meet now.
Right now!]

741
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:53,010
[What did you plan
behind my back?]

742
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,820
Isn't it nice that you can bring
laughter to so many people?

743
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,970
[What did they plan
without letting Gary know?]

744
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,310
[Five hours ago...]

745
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,870
[Since the opening in the morning]

746
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,140
<i>Who has a schedule
tomorrow morning?</i>

747
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,540
<i>Are we staying until the morning?</i>

748
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,570
<i>If you can't escape, you will have to
leave the island early in the morning.</i>

749
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,240
<i>[Serious face]</i>

750
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,070
<i>[Gary said he has to finish
recording for his new album.]</i>

751
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,720
<i>[11:50 a.m.]
We'll give you 30 minutes.</i>

752
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,110
<i>[He was more enthusiastic than ever...]</i>

753
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,940
<i>[The first mission,
'Finding the Lucky Bag']</i>

summoned Jae Suk]

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,460
[while he was searching
for lucky bags.]

756
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,640
What's the matter?

757
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,070
Don't show that we're talking.

758
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,040
- Do you want to escape from here?
- Of course.

759
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,140
I really want to escape from here.

760
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,080
A few years ago around this time

761
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,780
we had a special theme.
Do you remember?

762
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,670
- I don't remember.
- It was a Thanksgiving special.

763
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,010
TruGary Show...

764
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,340
[TruGary Show?]

765
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,170
[It was Thanksgiving special in 2011.]

766
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,440
[It was four years ago...]

767
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,610
<i>You're the spy today.</i>

768
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:31,040
<i>[For the first time, Gary was
assigned as a spy.]</i>

769
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:38,010
<i>[But, the whole thing was a
hidden camera for Gary.]</i>

770
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,370
<i>[They've seen every single
act of Gary.]</i>

771
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,070
<i>[TruGary Show!]</i>

772
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:51,010
<i>[Gary's poor acting skill
made everyone laugh.].</i>

773
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:56,030
<i>[After that, he couldn't be
a spy for a long time.]</i>

774
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,310
[But Why did you bring up
the TruGary Show again?]

775
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,970
- Do you want to escape?
- Yes.

776
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,840
I really want to escape.

777
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,170
[Today's real mission]

778
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,910
[TruGary Show Returns]
Are you serious?

779
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,170
When you escape, we'll take you
to the other side of this island.

780
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,740
We've prepared
a resting place over there.

781
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,050
You can play as if
you're on the beach.

782
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,260
Your mission will be completed

783
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,410
If Gary is left alone,
and everyone else is gathered there.

784
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,700
After 30 minutes of searching, you and
Jae Suk need to spread the rule.

785
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,130
If we let them know at once,
that might be too burdensome.

786
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,000
What should I do?

787
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,840
Gary said he'll really do his best.

788
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,870
He told me he must get out.
He only thinks about one thing.

789
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,940
He doesn't think twice.

790
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,920
We're in trouble.
This is going to be hard.

791
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,210
Uh-uh, there's Kang Hee Gun.

792
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:06,560
[He had worked harder
than ever before.]

793
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,740
[I must...]

794
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,840
[escape this island!]

795
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,570
[on the other side of the island...]

796
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,440
[Jae Suk passes the TruGary
Show mission on to Ha Ha.]

797
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,270
- Do you remember TruGary show?
- Yes.

798
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,170
Just pretend it's nothing special.

799
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,710
- We need to leave Gary on the island.
- Says who?

800
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,770
When we escape, there's a place
where we can take a rest.

801
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,090
It's nonsense!

802
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,940
- It's nonsense!
- I'm serious!

803
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,010
- Where?
- They told me and Jong Kook first.

804
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,270
Don't lie to me!

805
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,370
- Don't say it to Gary.
- Is it for real?

806
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:53,140
[During the lunch break]

807
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,310
[When Gary walks around...]

808
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,580
[Let's carry out the plan!]
Ji Hyo.

809
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,770
Where's Gary?

810
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,940
Is he far from us?

811
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,870
- Kim Jong Gook!
- Jong Kook!

812
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,070
[Wait, Gary is still too close.]

813
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,510
Today, our mission is TruGary Show.

814
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,470
[Really?]
Did you know?

815
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,070
In a nut shell

816
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,140
Gary has to be the last one
on this island.

817
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,070
It's actually Gary's hidden camera.

818
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,750
We can't let Gary escape.
He has to stay here till the end.

819
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,940
This is hidden camera.
We need to leave Gary here.

820
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,460
[Gary comes back at that moment!]

821
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,030
Gary's coming.

822
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,610
[He didn't hear us, did he?]

823
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,710
[The rules are passed on to everyone.]

824
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,110
This is a simple game.

825
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,370
It's the 'Telepathic Image Game
with the Citizen.'

826
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,310
[Wink]
[Okay]

827
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,610
I think Gary has to be the third.

828
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,310
[Everyone's pushing him
near the top.]

829
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,110
Gary ranks seventh.

830
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,210
<i>[They push him for
the opposite image of Gary.]</i>

831
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,210
<i>Gary will rank higher.</i>

832
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,440
<i>[They successfully interrupt Gary.]</i>

833
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,070
<i>[I'm sorry, Gary.]</i>

834
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:31,110
<i>[For the second question...]</i>

835
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,670
<i>[everyone expects
Mr. Capable as number one.]</i>

836
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,840
<i>- I would be third?
- You'll rank third.</i>

837
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,170
[They push him for a
higher rank again.]

838
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,010
[But, Gary ranked first.]

839
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,010
[They could have been failed if they
pushed him for the first place.]

840
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,810
<i>Wow, this is unbelievable.</i>

841
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,470
<i>[In the meantime,
Ji Hyo escapes first.]</i>

842
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,310
<i>[And the other members are acting.]</i>

843
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,730
<i>- She's really leaving.
- Bye!</i>

844
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,130
<i>Running Man is a reality show!</i>

845
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,600
<i>Bye bye!
[He says bye seriously.]</i>

846
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:13,070
I saw the look on Gary's face
was getting long.

847
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,310
I don't think me, Gary, and John Park
will escape from here.

848
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,970
Bye!

849
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,410
Wait, stop the boat!

850
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,840
I just need to find one more!
[He's acting.]

851
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,770
[Will I be able to release the album?]
Under the scorching sun...

852
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,540
Bye, see you!

853
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,540
Bye, Kang Gary!
See you later!

854
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,870
<i>It's time to say goodbye.</i>

855
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,870
From now on

856
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,810
we have group of games,
that might let you leave at once.

857
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,980
We need 15 to 20 minutes
to prepare them.

858
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,720
Should we rest?

859
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,690
You can take rest, or search for bags.

860
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,360
- I'll search for it.
- Where should I go?

861
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,430
- East, west, north, or south?
- Wait, Gary...

862
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,430
[Desperate]
I need to go find it.

863
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,160
I'm in a hurry.

864
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,630
[I feel so bad...]
He really needs to go.

865
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,970
[But we will win
only if you stay here.]

866
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,570
I'll leave first, so let me know
which direction.

867
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,840
The name tags are hidden as before.

868
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,810
You can leave now,
and you'll hear a siren in 20 minutes.

869
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,380
- Did you hide some more?
- Give me an O if anyone finds it.

870
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,220
They've hid them again?

871
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,070
['TruGary Show in desert island'
begins now!]

872
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,490

faster than anyone.]

[What should I do
about my album?]

877
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,470
Well, we'll all escape except Gary.

878
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,020
[Giraffe found a lucky bag.]

879
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,060
Oh, if Gary had found this one.

880

[It's H for Hee.]

881
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,030
Kwang Soo, give me one.

882
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,800
I have none.
[Ha Ha also needs an 'H.']

883
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,640
Do you have a D?

884
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,370
- What about an H?
- Do you have any?

885
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,740
You don't need these.

886
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,610
[Is that so?]
Who needs an O?

887
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,040
Can you give me one sticker?

888
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:40,840
Suk, give me anything you don't need.

889
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,870
- Give me the leftovers.
- Suk Jin...

890
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,170
- Do you have a J?
- No.

891

[Let's share it.]

[Jae Suk gives Ye Eun a K for Park.]

894
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,940
Great!

895
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,610
We need to help each other.

896

[Is that nice to be together?]

897

[Giraffe, the human search engine
runs about everywhere.]

899
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,440
[It's a delivery.]

- Uh!
- Did you find one?

901
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:29,610
- What's that?
- Is that 'WA'?

902
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,940

[Gary finds a lucky bag.]

904
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,170
- How many do you need?
- I just found one.

905
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,410
It's a K.

906
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:50,170
I thought you had an H,
so I gave it to Dong Hun.

907
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,410
Who needs an O?

908
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:59,840
- Do you have an O?
- I have everything.

909
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,410
[Suk Jin gets another I
from Gyu Hyun.]

910
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,740
- I need to find U.
- I'll give it to you, if I find it.

911
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,510
Where could it be?

912
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:14,310
[John Park was looking
from a distance and concluded...]

913
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,810
It's a nice view.

914

[20 minutes passed.]
[Lucky bag searching is over.]

915
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,310
Did you find any?

916
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,470
I found one bag.

917
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,140
- What did you find?
- K.

918
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,500
[He should not find them.]

919
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,040
Gary, what do you need?

920
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,110
I need H and...

921
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,210

[Will they be able to leave
him on the island?]

924
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,910
We don't have much time left.

925
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,950
You have about two hours and a half.

926
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,170
[Nervous]

927
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,910
- What do you need?
- O!

928
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,770
Ye Eun, you only need a K.

929
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,410
I have K, too.
Jae Suk gave me this earlier.

930
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,510
[Ye Eun can escape the island!]

931
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,440
- Ye Eun is done.
- You have K and O?

932
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,010
Then, complete your name
on the jacket.

933
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,170
Does anyone have 'WA'?

934
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,850
[Only Kwang Soo's name has 'WA.']

935
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,250
- I don't think it's easy to find.
- I haven't find any.

936
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,730
What happened to Gary?

937
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,430
I still need four more.
[Come to paradise, Ye Eun!]

938
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,560
[Park Ye Eun]
Congratulations, Ye Eun!

939
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,500
You can wear the life jacket
and leave the island.

940
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
- Thank you!
- Who needs an H?

941
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,470

[I want it!]

942
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,010
- I need one.
- Where?

H for Hee.

944
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,780
- Ah...
- You found an H.

945

[What's going on?]

946
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,460
- Do you need it?
- I'm done.

947
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,690
I need it!

948
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:20,300
[If he gets that H,
only three vowels will be blank.]

949
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,070
[He might leave before five o'clock.]

950
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,570
[Do something about it.]

951
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,740
Use it to trade,
if someone has what you need.

952
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,840
- I only need a U.
- Switch with me, then.

953
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,050
Do you have it?
You don't have it.

[What are you doing, stupid?]
[I didn't know that.]

00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:45,020
I only need a U.
[He's the stupidest of all...]

956
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,120
You found all except one?

957
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,690
When did he collect them all?

958
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,660
[Will we be able to
trick Gary till the end?]

959

962
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,310
I have the simplest game.

963
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,180
- Stick a match?
- Draw a match?

964

[The mission is revealed.]

965
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,260
- Guess the numbers on the match!
- No.

966
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,540
Ignite in one strike.
We'll give you what you want.

967
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,700
- In one strike?
- Yes.

968
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,330
- That's not that easy.
- That's easy.

969
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:35,100
It's hard for some people.

970
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,740
Matches break If you strike too hard,
or don't ignite if you strike too weak.

971
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,710
- And it's windy, too.
- We'll count one, two, three.

972
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,950
- Ha Ha's bad at this.
- I'll go first.

00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,490
Gary will be the first runner?

975
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,920
He's desperate!
[We should be careful.]

976
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Ready!

977
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,660

- Four.

978

- Count to three, everyone.
- It's windy all of a sudden.

981
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,700
It's so windy.

982
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,840
- Did they bring a fan?
- Isn't this almost like a storm?

983
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:20,080
- I'll do it now!
- One, two, three!

984

[Help us, wind.
We want to go home first.]

One, two... th...

988
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,000
It was three seconds!

989
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,840
[The counting was buffering at 98%.]

990
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,410
[He looks at them,
but no one's on Gary's side.]

991
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,780
But he still got fire.

992
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,020
You should have done it now.

993

[I think they paused...]

994
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,520
[We're lucky that we
have to trick Gary.]

995
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,930
It's strange it was windy
when you tried.

996
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,560
Get ready.
[He comes forward to block the wind.]

997
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,710

with windbreak.]

00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,110
It was good!

1000
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,970
That's enough!
[He's upset!]

1001
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,750
It's already passed three seconds.
We need to play other games, too.

1002

- The generation of match!
- Turn your back, it's windy.

[What the heck?]
I sneezed.

1035
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,910
You just blew it off!

1036
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:33,030
- I sneezed.
- It was clearly sneezing.

1037
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,870
That was a sneeze?

1038
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,010
Gyu Hyun, was that a sneeze?

1039
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,470
He was sweaty but all of a sudden
it's windy.

1040
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,480
[Absurd]

1041
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,950
- Rap Mon, was that a sneeze?
- I think it sounded natural.

1042
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,250
[They need Jae Suk for
tricking Gary till the end.]

1043
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,180
That's unfair!

1044
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,590
Those of you who did it,
tell me the letter you want.

1045
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,520
I want an 'O.'

1046
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,630
[He finishes Kim Jong Kook.]

1047
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,660
[Kim Jong Kook escapes the island.]

1048
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,100
- Can I put this one now?
- Yes.

1049
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:11,840
Why did you blow it off, Suk Jin?

1050
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,240
[He need three more letters.]

1051
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,780
Ha Ha needs to get one more.

1052
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,450
- No, I'm leaving now.
- You are?

1053
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,010
Are you leaving, too, Rap Mon?

1054
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:28,250
Should we wear it
before we get on the boat?

1055
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,190
- Many people helped me.
- Everyone's leaving.

1056
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,640
- Are you leaving, Kwang Soo?
- I'm leaving.

1057
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,800
Who's staying?
Jae Suk, Gary... four of you?

1058
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
[John Park, Big-nose,
Gary and Jae Suk?]

1059
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,100
- Are you leaving, Gyu Hyun?
- Yes.

1060
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,500
[Gyu Hyun completes his name.]

1061
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,670
- John Park, I, Gary...
- It's ripped.

1062
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,040
[One letter is ripped.]

1063
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,280
Well, if that's ripped, it's over.

1064
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,010
[Lee K...ng Soo]

1065
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,080
[He wanted to get 'WA' so much,
but he ripped it apart.]

1066
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:08,090
Let me have a marker.
This is unfair!

1067
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,830
He blew out my match.

1068
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,900
[Things happens in life.]

1069
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,240
I earned this!

1070
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,600
Step back for now.

1071
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,040
I'll clear the situation,
please go back.

1072
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,280
[It's Giraffe's mistake.
What will be the solution?]

1073
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,380
The letter 'WA...'

1074
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,380
We made two of them.

1075
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,820
We kept one for giving you out.

1076
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,420
The other one is hidden somewhere.

1077
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,840
[Huh, how is it possible to find it?]

1078
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,090
If you can't find it,
you have to stay here.

1079
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,240
I just need to correct
it with a marker.

1080
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,410
He kicked away a good fortune.

1081
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,610
[But don't fail the mission
because of this!]

1082
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,540
- Three o'clock!
- Not yet.

1083
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,340
I think it's 10 minutes away.

1084
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:04,770
2:48 p.m?
They say it's 2:50.

1085
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,640
- 10 minutes away.
- Even this doesn't work.

1086
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,550
[Depressed]
I'll try this in 10 minutes.

1087
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,540
[I'm depressed, too.]

1088
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,120
I need to finish the recording.
Let's hurry...

1089
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,640
- Four of you can leave now.
- Thank you!

1090
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,970
Kim Jong Kook, why are you leaving?

1091
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,370
What's wrong with that?
[Who will stop Gary with me?]

1092
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,640
Kwang Soo might not
be able to leave here.

1093
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,970
- Kwang Soo ruined it.
- He might be left with Gary.

1094
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,140
If Kwang Soo can't find it.
Then, it's over.

1095
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,150
That's right.

1096
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,970
Didn't Gary succeed at the match game?

1097
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,410
But we need to leave
Gary here alone, right?

1098
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,580
That's right.

1099
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:46,110
- In the end, we need to.
- I gave him an 'H.'

1100
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,690
Good job.

1101
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,740
[Recording, recording]

1102
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,040
- Is he staying?
- Yes, he's staying.

1103
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,370
I'm sorry, but we can't
give you what you want

1104
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:59,240
even if you win this game.

1105
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:03,810
Then what am I supposed to do?

1106
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,010
Ask for 'o' and 'a' to
make the 'WA' sound.

1107
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,670
'O' and 'A' instead of 'WA.'

1108
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,610
- How about that?
- So, two instead of one?

1109
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,010
- You don't have 'WA'?
- I have to find it.

1110
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,240
I've searched for hours,
but I couldn't find 'WA.'

1111
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:21,010
[Island, waa...]

1112
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,510
I'll win 'O' and 'A.'

1113
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,340
This is decibel meter.

1114
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,670
You will scream in front of the meter

1115
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,340
and one person with
the highest number will win.

1116
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,570
When you become castaway,
you should scream loud.

1117
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,770
There was a reason behind the games.

1118
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,840
[The first runner is John Park.]
Should I start now?

1119
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,940
- Ah!
- That's too weak.

1120
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,550
- It's 98.4.
- You need to have more than 100.

1121
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,090
I'm getting nervous.

1122
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,140
[The second runner of
Ring My Decibel is Big-nose.]

1123
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,540
[He has the highest number.]
124.7!

1124
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,970
Ikay!

1125
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,470
What do you mean by 'ikay'?

1126
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,740
[Damn it.]
Suk Jin is talking non-sense.

1127
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,640
He said 'ikay' instead of 'okay.'

1128
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,210
[I'm not myself.]

1129
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,280
[He's holding the microphone
with two hands.]

1130
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,810
I can't read the meter.

1131
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,980
I'm in a hurry...

1132
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,940
Calm down!

1133
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,670
- Gary, calm down.
- I'll do anything.

1134
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,440
I need to release my album on time.

1135
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,940
- I understand that...
- Just let me...

1136
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,110
[Gary... since when did you
start moving so fast?]

1137
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:45,530
[Oh, my throat that usually work
for slow raps, please help me.]

1138
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,470
[Rock spirit!]

1139
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,480
[What was the sound?]

1140
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,370
That was loud.

1141
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,540
130.

1142
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:04,020
[I'm burned out.]

1143
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,060
[To stop Gary from getting a letter
someone has to get a higher number.]

1144
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,560
[The fourth runner of
Ring My Decibel is Giraffe.]

1145
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,130
[I'm going to do my best
to make Gary stay.]

1146
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:22,100
[I'll complete the TruGary Show.]

1147
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,870
Start!

1148
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,940
[Side attack!]

1149
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,980
[That's my persona!]

1150
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,380
I'm sorry.

1151
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,280
You don't have to say sorry.

1152
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,210
92.4.
[The lowest number]

1153
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,450
I'm in a hurry.

1154
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:41,290
[The foul king]

1155
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,630
[The last runner of
Ring My Decibel, Grasshopper]

1156
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,670
Sorry, I'm desperate.

1157
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,410
[Desperate Gary at the back]
[Betrayal Giraffe at the side]

1158
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,570
You can start any moment you're ready.

1159
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,170
I'm not ready yet.

1160
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:06,250
Ready, set...

1161
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,010
go!

1162
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,420
[His whole body is shaking.]

1163
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,690
Gary won this.

1164
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:20,630
[Gary wins at Ring My Decibel.]

1165
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,060
[Gary gets 'EE.']

1166
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,130
Isn't that unfair?

1167
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:30,440
- This is the worst piece!
- They had 'EE'?

1168
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,440
I still have two more to get.

1169
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,850
Wasn't that too much?
[Time to focus on the TruGary Show.]

1170
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,950
This is not a clean game.

1171
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,780
Gary needs two, I need one,
and Kwang Soo needs two.

1172
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,420
Do I really need two?

1173
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,420
- Sung Gyu?
- I need two.

1174
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,490
- I need one more.
- Me, too.

1175
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,530
Let's just help each other
and leave together.

1176
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,130
We'll escape together!

1177
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,740
This is a battle between
production crews and us!

1178
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,660
[Two hours left until
five o'clock.]

1179
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,270
[They have to collect
about two letters.]

1180
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,140
We need to help the ones
with less letters first.

1181
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,740
[What will be the final result?]

1182
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,410
I feel bad for Gary.

1183
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,840
[On the other side of the island,
members who escaped are taking a rest.]

1184
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,810
Gary has no idea
that we're relaxing like this.

1185
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,640
Can you throw me a banana?

1186
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,140
Have a baguette with condensed milk.

1187
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,740
I feel sorry for them.

1188
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,310
It's so delicious.

1189
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,570
Can we just enjoy this?

1190
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,000
What if Kwang Soo can't escape?

1191
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,430
He has to find a piece, 'WA.'

1192
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,940
It's impossible.

1193
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,810
By the way... why do I feel
like I'm in detention?

1194
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,540
It feels really bad.

1195
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,280
Why did we even take the IQ test?

1196
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,480
It's the same usual members!

1197
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,580
Gary, Suk Jin...

1198
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,990
[They're Dumb and Dumber Avengers.]

1199
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,690
Is this a detention of life?

1200
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:03,490
- You need to hold the both ends.
- Do we tie a knot?

1201
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:07,630
You should tie a knot while you
hold each end with your hand.

1202
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,000
- You can do it.
- What are you talking about?

1203
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,040
- Just one knot?
- Yes, go somewhere and practice.

1204
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,510
- Anyone who can do it can try first?
- Yes.

1205
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:20,740
Is this possible?

1206
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,770
I'm going to do it, no matter what!

1207
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,740
Three o'clock!

1208
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,340
[Tying a knot is too difficult!]

1209
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,840
[I want to guess the time
and leave this island...]

1210
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,440
It's not.

1211
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,540
Three o'clock!

1212
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,540
[He tries right after
Grasshopper fails.]

1213
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,910
- John Park!
- Really?

1214
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:55,080
[John Park succeeds
at three o'clock mission.]

1215
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,580
You're right.
What letter do you want?

1216
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,210
Is it three o'clock?
And I was wrong?

1217
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,480
- You were wrong.
- What time was it?

1218
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,790
You shouted 12 seconds before 3.

1219
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,840
What do you want, John Park?

1220
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:10,940
I want an 'S.'

1221
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:13,970
It was so close.

1222
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,760
[Gary is struggling with the rope.]

1223
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:24,270
If you're not going to challenge,
please go away from the table.

1224
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:28,940
We'll give you a letter for two people.

1225
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,780
[I need to win second place!]

1226
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,750
Park, you need to be good.

1227
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:40,150
[Gary needs two letters
and the rest needs one letter.]

1228
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:41,720
This drives me nuts.

1229
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,120
I'll leave first.

1230
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:47,160
I'm sorry.
[Big-nose will leave?]

1231
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,030
[Do you even know how to play it?]

1232
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,200
You need to twist it.

1233
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,140
[He knows something.]

1234
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:02,270
[Will he be able to tie a knot?]

1235
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,040
[I'll copy what he does.]

1236
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,780
I'll escape now and
leave him with you.

1237
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,480
He doesn't know how to do it.
He's playing jump rope.

1238
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,820
I'll try now.

1239
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,820
[He's in a hurry.]

1240
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,860
[He puts the rope through his body .]

1241
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,970
[It's back to square.]

1242
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:30,270
Wait, wait!
I'm not done yet.

1243
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,040
Wait, I...

1244
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,510
[Is he a performance artist?]

1245
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,710
Wait, wait.

1246
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,940
I haven't touched the rope
with my hands.

1247
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:46,480
I haven't touched it.
Wait.

1248
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,140
[It's like marching in place.]
You saw I didn't touch it, right?

1249
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:56,640
So, I just need to tie a knot, right?

1250
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,800
[Now, I just need to put it down.]

1251
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,070
[Putting it up again]

1252
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,440
Wait for me!

1253
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,580
- Gary, how long are you...
- Wait!

1254
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,350
Wait and watch!

1255
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:18,210
Gary, I think you failed.
Did you do it?

1256
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,820
What?
Did he tie a knot?

1257
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:25,460
[His strong wish made a miracle...]

1258
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:31,030
- I don't think you tied it.
- Yes, I did it.

1259
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,960
Put it one more time will do.

1260
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,940
He's really passionate.

1261
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,840
He's going to do it!

1262
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,570
I've never seen him doing
anything so hard.

1263
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,010
[He figured it out!
What's the result?]

1264
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,580
[Please, please, please!]

1265
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:59,620
- Gary, what are you doing?
- How long are you going to do that?

1266
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,460
Don't we need to have a time limit?

1267
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,230
- Gary, I don't think you can...
- I'm doing it.

1268
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,630
I just need to take it out!

1269
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,730
[Empty]

1270
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,570
[He's so naive.]

1271
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,570
[Dizzy, dizzy]

1272
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,810
Can we watch him?
He keeps saying he knows the answer.

1273
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:24,080
I know the answer.

1274
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,650
But the arm is the problem.

1275
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:30,550
- It doesn't make sense.
- It's impossible.

1276
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,890
[Big-nose knows the secret?]
I'll do it.

1277
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,120
I need to get on the boat.

1278
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,560
What is he doing?

1279
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,770
It doesn't make sense.

1280
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,010
Look at Suk Jin.

1281
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,440
Yeah!
[Success!]

1282
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,270
[He twisted his arms first and did it.]

1283
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,170
[He tied a knot!]

1284
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,710
[Culture shock]

1285
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,270
[I still don't understand...]

1286
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,710
- Did you see that?
- Ji Suk Jin succeeded.

1287
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,710
Let me try!

1288
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:07,890
[Jae Suk saw what
Big-nose was doing.]

1289
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,070
Does this really work?

1290
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,240
[He's still tries
with his whole body.]

1291
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,400
[Carefully]
He's going to fail.

1292
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:25,840
I did it!
[Grasshopper succeeds at it.]

1293
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:34,250
I can leave now!
[Big-nose and Grasshopper can escape!]

1294
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,140
This is how you do it?

1295
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,310
That's how you do it.

1296
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:48,660
Stop it!
Just stop it!

1297
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,040
How did you figure it out?

1298
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,840
I've seen it in a book.

1299
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:56,540
- We did it!
- We did it!

1300
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,210
- Wear the jacket and leave.
- Okay!

1301
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,710
What do we do if Jae Suk leaves?

1302
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:06,370
[Will the TruGary Show be able to go
on as planned with Giraffe and John Park?]

1303
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,440
I can give you a deal.

1304
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:11,870
Only three of you are left.

1305
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,210
The last game I suggest
is guessing due north.

1306
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:21,710
Make a straight line
that you think points due north.

1307
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,830
We'll put a compass.

1308
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,840
We'll give you the letter you want,
if you're correct.

1309
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,570
Let's do it.

1310
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:34,110
Otherwise, you can go search the island.

1311
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,010
It's up to you.

1312
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,840
[Runs]

1313
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,250
[He'd rather find 'WA' at once,
than play two missions.]

1314
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:45,710
I've searched almost everywhere.

1315
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,280
Where do I find 'AO...'

1316
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,410
This drives me crazy.
Gary needs one more after that mission.

1317
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,240
West...

1318
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,410
If that's the west

1319
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,710
then this is the east.

1320
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,140
I remember that line.

1321
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:06,510
This is the west, that is east.

1322
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:13,340
[He's mobilizing his whole sense
to guess the direction.]

1323
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,870
When we arrived here at noon...
[You don't look like Gary...]

1324
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,470
[Will his sense of urgency
wake up his potential?]

1325
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,750
I think this is the direct north.

1326
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,210
I'm decided.

1327
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:35,470
It's slightly different.

1328
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,110
[Two lines are similar
but different, who's the winner?]

1329
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,610
Please, be correct!

1330
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:47,670
- How many letters do you need?
- One.

1331
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,980
- How many letters do you need?
- Two.

1332
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,610
Gary is correct.

1333
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,610
[Garry guessed it right.]
It was correct!

1334
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:58,050
Check it out, it's correct!

1335
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,640
How did you guess that right?
Gary needs to collect one.

1336
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:04,910
[He needs a 'U.']

1337
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:06,840
[All three of them need one letter.]

1338
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,570
[It's the last chance
to search and find!]

1339
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,670
[Where are you, 'U'?]

1340
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:16,810
You need a herbalist from Joseon Era.

1341
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:22,710
[John Park is searching for 'K.']

1342
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:28,640
[It's become a heated
triangular contest!]

1343
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,870
[Seriously, where is it?]

1344
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,610
Please...

1345
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:43,760
[Giraffe is focused on the area
that he hasn't been to.]

1346
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,140
[John Park finds a bag
in between rocks.]

1347
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:56,610
[But it's 'D.']

1348
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:01,170
[The coastline is long,
but it's still a piece of land.]

1349
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,510
[John Park finds another bag.]

1350
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,440
I found K!

1351
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,940
[He finishes Park Sung Gyu.]

1352
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:22,170
[John Park escapes
from the desert island!]

1353
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:30,670
[Desperate Gary and Passionate Giraffe
are the only ones left!]

1354
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:34,770
[Success or Fail?
It's in their hands now!]

1355
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,770
[Will Gary win and finish the race?]

1356
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:41,110
[Or will Giraffe win and
finish the TruGary Show?]

1357
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:52,800
Wow!
[Eureka!]

1358
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,110
[Did he find the 'WA'?]

1359
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:59,030
What's going on?
Why is he running?

1360
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,270
Kwang Soo!

1361
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,970
[Did you find it, Kwang Soo?]

1362
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:16,540
Wa!

1363
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:20,870
Wa!
[He found 'WA.']

1364
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:27,840
- Did you find yours?
- Yes, I found a' K.'

1365
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,070
[Carefully]

1366
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,990
[I can't rip it
apart again!]

1367
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,070
[He's treating it like
a national treasure.]

1368
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,970
[It would have been a lot easier]

1369
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,670
[if his name was
'Kang Soo' or 'Kong Soo.']

1370
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,620
[Giraffe completes 'Lee Kwang Soo.']

1371
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:56,720
[Everyone except Gary escapes
from the desert island.]

1372
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:02,600
[Gary searches alone.]

1373
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,810
[Please, stop the time for me!]

1374
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:11,410
[We've completed our mission, bye!]

1375
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,310
[Everyone left like that...]

1376
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,870
[Deserted]

1377
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:23,650
[I put so much effort into
this album for more than a year...]

1378
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:29,740
[I couldn't finish recording
because I'm stuck on the island.]

1379
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,190
[Sigh]

1380
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:40,410
[Time is up!]

1381
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:47,570
[Gary fails the mission.]

1382
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,380
- Did Sung Gyu leave?
- Yes.

1383
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,250
[I'm all alone...]

1384
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,010
[I'll have to sleep on
this island by myself.]

1385
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:04,160
Are you okay?
[Nod, nod]

1386
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,270
Then, we'll take you to the tent

1387
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,070
by boat.

1388
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,770
[Devastated]

1389
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,070
[Goodbye studio session!]

1390
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:25,810
[I've worked so hard
to escape all day long...]

1391
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:30,910
[I'm stuck out here for a long while.]

1392
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:35,710
[Oh, my album...]
[I worked for a year and a half.]

1393
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,970
My album will have nine tracks.

1394
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,870
I tried to make ten tracks...
I'm sorry.

1395
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,570
I have bad luck this year.

1396
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,070
It'll be nine tracks.

1397
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:54,340
I've recorded it for a year and a half.

1398
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,740
Today...

1399
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:10,010
I want to believe this
is a hidden camera.

1400
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:13,410
Didn't you plan a hidden camera for me?

1401
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:16,510
[If you said that earlier,
the TruGary Show would have failed...]

1402
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,670
[They're having a party.]
We've succeeded!

1403
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,770
We did it.
This is the paradise!

1404
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,070
You're enjoying your time here?

1405
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,540
The title song of the album is

1406
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:33,740
'Get Some Air.'

1407
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,810
I guess that song is for me.

1408
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:39,880
I'm going there to get some air!

1409
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,190
[Where this boat takes me...]

1410
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:48,240
[is where I spend the night.]

1411
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,290
I wish this was a hidden camera for me.

1412
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,410
- Welcome!
- Kang Gary!

1413
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:04,400
Gary!

1414
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,870
[Where this boat lands...]

1415
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:10,610
[we wait for you.]

1416
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:15,250
Why are they all waiting there?

1417
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,720
[Am I the only one staying?]
What's going on?

1418
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,020
What is it?

1419
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:24,120
Kang Gary!
[Are you surprised?]

1420
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,330
What is it?

1421
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,500
What's going on?

1422
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,970
We had so much fun!

1423
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,000
He thought he was staying the night here.

1424
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,470
Yes.

1425
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,640
I was disheartened...

1426
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,110
- What is all this?
- Eat some.

1427
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:42,910
September fourth, a few years ago

1428
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:45,350
we had the 'TruGary Show.'

1429
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,910
The 'TruGary Show' has returned!

1430
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,150
[The TruGary Show returns
in desert island!]

1431
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:54,890
Thank you so much!
I can go home?

1432
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,720
Gary was desperate.

1433
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,370
Gary was the most desperate one.

1434
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,310
You had a 'K.'
Tell me.

1435
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,610
Me?

1436
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,210
He had a 'K' but he
didn't give it to me.

1437
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,540
- Did you have one?
- Yes.

1438
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:14,270
I thought he was going
to trade it later.

1439
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,710
Then, he left the island.

1440
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,440
I asked Jong Kook before I left.

1441
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,170
If it wasn't for hidden camera,
I would have felt really bad!

1442
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:25,270
Do you know what I was thinking?

1443
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,110
'It must have been an H.'

1444
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:32,140
Rap Monster wouldn't...

1445
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,470
[It's good that it's a happy ending.]

1446
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,340
So, today you've succeeded
at the 'TruGary Show.'

1447
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,140
The boat is here!

1448
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,370
- We can leave!
- Let's go!

1449
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,040
[Finally, they can
escape from the island.]

1450
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:55,610
- It was the TruGary Show!
- Thank you!

1451
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:58,640
[Thank you, Gary.]

1452
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,950
[After Gary got some air
he was able to finish the work.]

1453
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:06,750
