00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
[A dangerous invitation
to the Running Man cast!]

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,960
[Shall we start the game?]

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,560
[The Running Man members
are locked up in a giant maze.]

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,290
[The mysterious hunters
strangle the Running Man!]

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,250
[The maze with a great
secret opens now!]

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,490
["S" restaurant, Goyang, Gyeonggi-do]
This marinated crab is really good!

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,480
Marinated crab and
dried yellow corvina....

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,130
[What a nice feast!]

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,690
This dried yellow corvina
is so delicious!

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,720
I love this marinated crab!

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,890
Is the marinated crab good?

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,720
Yes, it's not very salty.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,830
The bell-flower root is amazing.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,290
This must be fresh bell-flower root.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,700
- This is a feast...
- That's what I'm saying.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,430
Why are they filming us eating?

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,740
Is there something?

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,340
[What's this strange feeling...]

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,310
Are we in the middle of something?

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,120
Is this a mission?

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,360
[Look of suspicion]

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,760
Why are they staring
at us so pitifully?

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,470
What are we doing today?

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,850
We finished our meal.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,380
[Their anxiety grows...]

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,450
[Someone gets out of the car,
with their face hidden.]

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,070
[The mysterious mask.]

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,840
[He's holding an
invitation in his hands.]

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,310
You know when you sell your cows...

30
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,710
you feed them a lot right before
they go to the slaughter house.

31
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,680
You've never raised cows, have you?

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,080
I just heard that from someone else...

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,940
[Where did you hear that?]

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,430
That surprised me!

35
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,010
That's scared me!

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,830
[A mysterious man walks
in and bows politely.]

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,850
[He hands over the
invitation without a word...]

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,940
[Confused]

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,250
[What is that?]

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,540
Read it!

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,470
You are invited!
Did you have a good meal?

42
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,210
We've prepared a
small party for you.

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,160
[A party just for
Running Man members...]

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,120
Please ride the limousine
waiting outside.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,980
I hope to see you, soon.

46
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,690
What is it?

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,360
Is there something
inside the limo?

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,760
- They said it's a party.
- It's party time!

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,490
[That's how the party began.]

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,050
[An unfamiliar space...]

51
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,140
[and a mysterious invitation...]

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,780
I was scared, but it's nothing.

53
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,250
[Ha Dong Hun is entering
the banquet hall.]

54
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,050
[Flinch]

55
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,780
[The floor isn't going
to give out, right?]

56
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,790
[There's a chill in the air.]

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,090
Wait a minute.

58
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,830
This sofa is not going
to shoot out, right?

59
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,000
[Anxious]

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,070
[Who invited Running Man here?]

61
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,430
<i>Hello!</i>

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,340
[You're the host?]

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,280
<i>Welcome to the mission town!</i>

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,940
<i>This mission town is full of</i>

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,310
<i>activities that will keep
my guests entertained.</i>

66
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,220
[Excited]

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,290
<i>First of all, can you answer
this simple question?</i>

68
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,490
Yes.

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,590
<i>Who do you like more?
Michael Jordan?</i>

70
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,390
<i>Or Bob Marley?</i>

71
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,060
[Ha Ha is in a sticky situation.]
That's too difficult!

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,930
This isn't fair.

73
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,500
It's like asking me to choose
between my mom and dad.

74
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,110
<i>Which nickname do you like more?
Big-nose or Race Starter?</i>

75
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,150
[It's a source of trouble.]

76
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,720
<i>Which song do you like more?
"Ballerino"</i>

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,420
<i>or "Get Some Air"?</i>

78
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,380
[Oh, my god.]

79
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,160
Wait a minute.

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,800
<i>Would you do 30 sit-ups
or 30 push-ups?</i>

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,330
That's really...

82
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>Would you avenge or betray
your fellow members?</i>

83
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,470
What's this?

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,320
Jae Suk!

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,160
<i>Which do you like better?
To chit-chat or to dance?</i>

86
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,780
I love to do both of them.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,410
I like to do both of them

88
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,850
but I just ate, so it's not
good to hop around.

89
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,120
I'd like to chit-chat now
because I just ate.

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,690
<i>Which do you like better?
Sleeping in or taking a nap?</i>

91
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,600
I love to do both...

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,520
I'd love to sleep in
and then take a nap.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,740
[What is the meaning
of these questions?]

94
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,700
I guess I love the newest song now.

95
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,010
I like Big-nose better.

96
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,140
I'll do 30 push-ups.

97
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,610
I choose sleeping in.

98
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,240
I'd love to chit-chat.

99
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,980
I choose Bob Marley.

100
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,520
<i>I see.</i>

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,210
<i>If that's the case</i>

102
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,990
<i>please go inside the room on the right.</i>

103
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,620
I see.

104
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Won't you show me your face?

105
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,960
Who could it be?

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I guess you're very rich.

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,500
[Who's the man behind the mask?]

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,170
[He's walking toward the
room on the right.]

109
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,540
What?
Why is everything so big?

110
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,880
What a huge sofa!

111
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,670
This must be Brobdingnag!
(Enormous land in "Gulliver's Travels ")

112
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,920
This is somewhat scary.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,320
[The big room]

114
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,490
Is this Brobdingnag?

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,760
It must be.
The sofa is enormous!

116
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,230
Is this coffee table?

117
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,230
This must be where a
Brobdingnagian lives.

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Seoul, Paris, New York,
London, Shanghai?

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,170
[A mysterious world clock on the wall!]

120
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,210
[What secret could be
hidden at this place?]

121
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,920
[After the greeting session]

122
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,520
Who are you, by the way?

123
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,020
Excuse me?

124
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,190
It makes me curious.

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,090
I'm going in.
[Full of curiosity]

126
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,690
[The small room]
Why is everything so small?

127
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,160
What's wrong with this place?

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,030
This is fun!

129
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,200
I love doing things like this!

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,270
[A tiny world that's different
from our daily life]

131
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,240
They've made something new.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,140
This must be Lilliput.

133
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,250
What am I supposed to do here?

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,020
They've prepared a lot.
I'm getting excited.

135
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,350
Hurry up, I'm excited, too.

136
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,650
[Where are we?]
Come in.

137
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,690
- Maybe the other room is big.
- I think so, look at the garbage can.

138
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,830
[Fascinated]
Garbage can!

139
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,670
We're cultured men.
Sit on a chair.

140
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,740
[The sound of youthful innocence.]

141
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,070
Sit on a chair.

142
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,140
This...
[Squeak]

143
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,810
- That must be the big room.
- A big room and a small room.

144
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,550
Ji Hyo?

145
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,220
Ha Ha, what is this place?
[Blank Ji enters the big room.]

146
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,820
It's really big.
Look at the sofa.

147
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,220
Look at the table.

148
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,990
A Brobdingnagian must be living here.

149
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,320
- It's scary.
- Isn't it?

150
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
Guess.
What could it be?

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,000
I can't even guess.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,570
The big room.
Who invited us here and why?

153
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,300
It's not possible to guess,
because there's a weird thing.

154
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,270
New York, Paris...

155
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,640
Could this be
"the Gulliver's Travels Race"?

156
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,210
Well...
[There's got to be something...]

157
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,180
Someone is playing with us.

158
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,520
Someone is...

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,920
- Jigsaw killer?
- Yes, Jigsaw.

160
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,760
[Where is Jae Suk going?]
What's this?

161
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,730
What's this?

162
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,690
[Grasshopper enters the small room.]
Come in, it's the small room.

163
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,360
[What is this place?]

164
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,100
- This is tiring.
- Have a seat on the sofa.

165
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,740
- That's for three people.
- I just ate...

166
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,740
You never know,
so we were memorizing that.

167
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,240
- 9:00 in Seoul, 1:30 in Paris.
- This doesn't make any sense though.

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,310
Look.

169
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,780
The minutes have to match.

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,850
- That's right.
- But it's all different.

171
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,750
You don't need to memorize it.

172
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,550
- The large hand has to be in the middle.
- There's nothing.

173
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,320
It's nothing important.

174
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,820
Look, how could it be not important?

175
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,390
Then, why would it be
hanging over there?

176
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,340
I don't know!

177
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,660
[Look at him...]

178
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,630
This is a chat room.

179
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,090
Why did they put it up there?

180
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,130
This is not a chat room,
it's Big-nose's room.

181
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,380
[Lastly, where is Kwang Soo entering?]

182
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,940
[Giraffe enters the small room.]

183
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,840
- Kwang Soo!
- What is this?

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,510
Sit on the sofa.

185
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,160
That's a sofa?

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,080
It's the small room.
Everything is small here.

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,650
[Kwang Soo has to bend at 90 degrees.]

188
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,250
This is pretty comfortable.

189
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,830
It's too hard to move around here.

190
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,130
<i>Do you like the mission town
that you're invited?</i>

191
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,800
<i>We have plenty of time,
so please enjoy.</i>

192
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,360
<i>But to leave this place,
you need to complete missions.</i>

193
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,280
[The small room's mission -
Roll the red ball]

194
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,240
[and push all the blue balls
out of the circle.]

195
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,470
- 60 seconds?
- We have a time limit.

196
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,950
- Where are the blue balls?
- They're over there!

197
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,980
Quickly bring them over there!

198
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,990
[The big room's mission:
Roll the red ball]

199
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,810
[and push all the blue balls
out of the circle.]

200
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,460
[And their own balls inside the circle.]

201
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,590
It's like curling!

202
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,860
Let's do it!

203
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,720
The ball is... over there!

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,690
It's easier to do with smaller balls.

205
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,250
[It's unfair!]

206
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,360
It would be a lot easier
to do this in the small room.

207
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,250
What do we do?

208
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,670
It's easier to be in the small room.

209
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,030
[Apart from the ridiculous mission]

210
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,830
[Who would be the person
behind the mask?]

211
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:23,220
[And what he is up to?]

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,430
[Small Room]
We need to put five.

213
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,230
- With red balls...
- The balls are that small?

214
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,330
[The tiny-sized BB bullet]
Because we're in the small room.

215
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,760
[Squeak]
That's so noisy!

216
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,700
This is so stuffy.

217
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,710
[Their stress level goes up.]

218
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,280
[The first runner is Lee Kwang Soo.]

219
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,650
Challenge!
Suk Jin!

220
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,850
[You broke my concentration.]
Put the ball carefully.

221
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,140
[The mission starts!]

222
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,250
Your balls are flying in the air.

223
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,090
- Try it in the right direction.
- I don't think he can.

224
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,070
He lost his chance.

225
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,870
Doing it fast won't work.

226
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,380
- Okay!
- I'm going to put it for him.

227
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,250
[He keeps missing them.]

228
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,320
You should have done it already.
[Stress goes up!]

229
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,230
It's frustrating.
Just watching makes me frustrated.

230
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,010
Okay!
The last one!

231
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,690
[Just one more!]
Please!

232
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,410
Do it quickly!

233
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,920
Five more seconds!
Five, four!

234
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,050
Three, two, one!

235
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,290
[Lee Kwang Soo fails.]

236
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,120
Wait a minute.
What are you two doing?

237
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,090
Do I have to put the bullets?

238
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,670
You're the youngest out of three.

239
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,690
Then, I have to do this?

240
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,970
You're the youngest out of us!

241
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,010
If I put it over here...

242
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,240
- Someone else needs to collect them.
- I need to straighten things up.

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,610
Straighten what up?

244
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,720
Just straighten these up.

245
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,920
I need to rank everyone by age.

246
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,120
I guess people get mad
when they're in a tiny room.

247
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,010
[It was interesting at first,
but it's frustrating as time goes by.]

248
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,520
[The first runner, Jae Suk attempts.]

249
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,460
It's not even close!

250
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
I just pushed one ball.

251
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,560
Everyone is being sensitive.

252
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,830
Okay!
[One shot, three kills!]

253
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,740
Hit the left one just like bowling.

254
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,170
[Squeak]

255
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,210
What's with the sound?

256
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,580
Just sit on the floor!

257
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,780
It's too uncomfortable for me.

258
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,810
Okay!

259
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,120
- The last one!
- Do it quickly!

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,560
Put all five over there
and hit them continuously.

261
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Just like kicking a soccer ball!

262
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,460
- Six, five...
- I'm not going to do it!

263
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,330
[Blow that for a lark!]

264
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,380
This is upsetting!

265
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,250
- So upsetting!
- Move away!

266
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,540
[Stress goes up!]

267
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,940
Look at this!
[Squeak]

268
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,410
- We don't have enough time.
- It's too noisy!

269
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,840
[At last, everyone's anger
exploded in the small room!]

270
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,280
Put them carefully.

271
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,380
Put them all together.

272
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,320
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

273
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,020
[The first runner, Gary begins.]

274
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,660
Wow, that's great!

275
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,630
But it needs to go a little further.

276
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,730
[They will success if Ji Hyo and
Ha Ha's balls go inside the circle.]

277
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,870
That was too powerful.

278
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,140
That's right!
[It crashes with Gary's ball.]

279
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
You need to push it harder at first.

280
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,380
So, the ball has to stay at the back.

281
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,010
This was your fault,
because the ball was too close.

282
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,550
You're going to start nagging?

283
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,810
I'll push it harder this time.

284
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,290
Like I said before

285
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,620
the ball has to stay at the back,
so the next ball can go inside.

286
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,960
I wanted to do that!

287
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,300
- Let's just leave it.
- I made it, though.

288
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,330
You're too damn bad...
Oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,730
Let's bet a forehead slap.

290
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,870
Let's do that!

291
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,770
Why are you bringing that up again?
It's all over.

292
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,370
I tend to hold grudges.

293
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,690
[Kwang Soo is still
struggling with BB bullets.]

294
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,230
Do you have rotten fingers?

295
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,650
[How can you say such a harsh thing?]

296
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,230
It's not that.
I'm so irritated, I'm going to go crazy.

297
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,010
You need to flip it!

298
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,530
Why did you shake that?

299
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,470
Take a break!

300
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,890
- Don't we have any elastic bands?
- Focus!

301
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,940
Concentrate!

302
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,180
[He's going to nag for the whole day.]

303
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,290
He's not talented.

304
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,370
[That hurts my pride.]

305
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,490
Don't get up!
Get down!

306
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,870
- Get down!
- I can't do this any longer.

307
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,030
[Upset]

308
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,340
You know how much I swore
Suk Jin in my mind?

309
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,620
[They've been in the room for an hour,
and have become extremely sensitive.]

310
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,340
You're not talented.

311
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,320
You're not talented at this!

312
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,780
He said I'm not talented.

313
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,650
You know what I was thinking?
I don't want to be blamed by them.

314
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,970
My arm is dead.

315
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,570
[Aw, my joint!]

316
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,640
Why did you do that?

317
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,580
What's wrong with your arm?

318
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,810
- I feel numb.
- Are you okay?

319
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,490
I'll sit up and do it.

320
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,160
There's nothing you can't do,
when you concentrate.

321
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,660
This is harder than I thought.

322
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Let's just calm down.

323
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,930
Okay.

324
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,660
One, two, three!

325
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,830
[Calm down and shoot!]
I pushed it harder.

326
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,500
- Good, good!
- That looks good!

327
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,470
This is perfect!

328
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,940
We have no excuse,
if we fail this time.

329
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,810
- I'm slightly roll it.
- It's too far.

330
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,340
[The second runner is Blank Ji.]

331
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,760
- Slightly!
- Perfect, that's beautiful!

332
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,410
[After a while,
Blank Ji succeeded at it.]

333
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,450
- It's up to you, Ha Ha.
- Do it gently.

334
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,720
This is perfect.
It's bouncy.

335
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,830
[Success,
but it bounced back?]

336
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,380
[Please...]

337
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,650
This is a success.
If not, the host is too...

338
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,100
I didn't even push it,
but it went in the circle.

339
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,030
[Will it be accepted as a success?]

340
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,340
Honestly, it's a success.

341
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,380
[Congratulations,
you've succeeded at the mission.]

342
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,470
- Huh, what's that?
- Wait.

343
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,780
[Only one member can escape
the room for each mission.]

344
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,380
[Decide who will escape.]

345
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,410
[It was hard to finish the mission,
but only one can escape?]

346
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,490
Decide who will escape,
and pick a door to exit.

347
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,490
[Why are they doing this to us?]

348
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,450
[What's up his sleeve?]

349
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,100
- I'll go out first.
- No, you can't.

350
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,640
What are you talking about?

351
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,430
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

352
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,940
Rock-paper-scissors.

353
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,910
Or we can roll the ball
and play a game.

354
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,920
Let's do the Cola, Cider game.
The ball has to reach this line.

355
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,290
The ball staying inside the line will
win over the ball out of the line.

356
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,880
I'll roll the ball.

357
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,020
[Blank Ji rolls it!]
Good, good!

358
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,230
- Ji Hyo...
- That's too bad.

359
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,090
[Super focused]

360
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,830
[Gary who wanted to escape first...]

361
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,870
[It's not even close.]
I rolled it wrong.

362
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,050
I made a mistake.

363
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,090
Let me roll it again.

364
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,050
[Ha Ha rolls it confidently!]

365
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm going out first!

366
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,610
Bye!
[The fist escapee is Ha Ha.]

367
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,810
[He has to choose
between the two doors.]

368
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,810
Go that way.

369
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,760
Left or right?
I chose the right before.

370
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,890
I'll choose the right door again!

371
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,230
See you soon!

372
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,210
He's making me upset.

373
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,890
There are many other games.

374
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,250
I see, hurry up and go.

375
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,720
[What is waiting for Ha Ha
outside the door on the right?]

376
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,210
What is this?

377
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,110
There are so many doors!

378
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,050
[The two rooms are nothing!]

379
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,220
[This is the real beginning!]

380
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,290
[Ha Ha chose the door before him.]

381
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,890
[What?]

382
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,860
[Half of the wall is blocked?]

383
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,630
[No way...]
[Am I supposed to go in here?]

384
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,650
Are you serious?

385
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,410
[It does look like a maze...]

386
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,410
[He needs to put his head down
and bend on his knees.]

387
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,080
How is it possible to get in here?

388
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,250
Are you serious or joking?

389
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,550
[To escape, you need to crawl.]

390
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,120
Oh, I'm supposed to crawl on the floor?

391
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,130
[Section 1 - Crawling maze]
Crawling under the net?

392
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,630
[Ha Ha, starting to crawl
through the maze.]

393
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,670
What's wrong with this?

394
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,210
[He can't even get up to find a route.]

395
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,010
Where should I go?

396
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,090
[Suffocated...]
[At a loss...]

397
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,230
[Will Ha Ha be able to escape
from the crawling maze?]

398
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,860
[Jae Suk and Suk Jin succeeded.]

399
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,530
[Only Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are left.]

400
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,330
Don't try to do it fast.
Just focus.

401
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,470
If you can't do this,
you'll become a failure.

402
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,170
Okay, okay.

403
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,370
If you can't succeed at it this time...

404
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,880
If you want your new movie
"Sashimi Boy" to be successful

405
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,110
[He's making fun of him being]

406
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,850
[a fish in the movie
"Collective Invention"]

407
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,690
It's a rockfish, not a halibut.

408
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,380
I think the film will
draw ten million

409
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,490
but Bo Young, Chun Hee
will have the honor for the success.

410
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,720
[Anger is the source of my strength!]

411
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,360
[He succeeded at pushing the ball out.]

412
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,100
You're dead meat.

413
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
Get ready.

414
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,230
[If Kkuk fails at it,
they need to start over.]

415
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,740
[Stubborn]

416
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,970
[Noisy]

417
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,610
[Kkuk succeeds at it!]

418
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,980
[Worthy of the name, Mr. Capable]

419
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,870
Only one member can escape
the room for each mission.

420
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,790
- We're not leaving this room together?
- We did this mission together.

421
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,630
What are you talking about?

422
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,590
Why do we have to follow this rule?

423
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,660
- Because this is a mission.
- Oh, that's right.

424
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,600
You can go home, if you
don't want to follow the rule.

425
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,730
[Embarrassed]

426
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,430
You don't have to be on Running Man.

427
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,030
[Even a chair is upset
at his weird comment.]

428
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,840
- Suk Jin is disqualified!
- Seriously!

429
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,540
[Squeak]

430
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,740
Let's play the hand flip
and pick one person.

431
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,610
I'll escape the room this time!

432
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,610
[Who will be the first
escapee of the small room?]

433
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,190
[Big-nose!]

434
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,150
[Envy]

435
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,590
See you.

436
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,230
Let him escape the room first.

437
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,860
[Big-nose doesn't even look back.]

438
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,470
[The air of the room becomes combative.]

439
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,200
I did it so well,
I should have gone first.

440
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,170
I'll throw rock.

441
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,210
Rock-paper-scissors!

442
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,240
I'm sorry, Gary.

443
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
- Ji Hyo...
- I'm sorry.

444
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,210
We played the game fairly.

445
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,820
Gary, I'm sorry.
I'll leave first.

446
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,620
[Ji Hyo chose the door
that Ha Ha didn't choose.]

447
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,560
[What will be behind
the door on the left?]

448
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:59,430
[A dizzy-looking giant maze!]

449
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,970
[Section 2 - Normal maze]

450
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,140
[Big-nosed brother
enters the maze, too.]

451
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,640
It's fun.
It's really interesting today.

452
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,110
Where am I supposed to go?

453
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,550
[The path is blocked?]

454
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,750
[It's not a wall, but a door?]

455
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,590
[This maze only has doors.]

456
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,100
[Section 3 - Door maze]

457
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,770
[Blank Ji is at the maze.]

458
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,840
[She walks carefully.]

459
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:51,450
[She looks everywhere,
but all the walls look the same.]

460
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,120
[Thud]
You scared me!

461
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,720
The way...
wait!

462
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,790
This is a maze.

463
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,100
[Even looking at the door
maze makes us stuffy.]

464
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,370
[The route changes every
time he opens a door.]

465
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,470
There's no way out.

466
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,380
This is amazing!

467
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,720
[Ji Hyo is still wandering in the maze.]

468
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,590
[It looks all the same...]

469
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,770
[Surprised]

470
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,720
[Woman's intuition]
[I'm sure there's something!]

471
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,920
[Scream]

472
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,470
What was that?

473
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,840
Isn't this where I started?

474
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,170
Where am I supposed to go?

475
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,910
This way...

476
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,110
I think it's this way.

477
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,650
Is this the right way?

478
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,920
There's no exit.

479
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,260
Why, why?
What?

480
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,400
Why?

481
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,370
[One by one, they are disappearing...]

482
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,940
[Jae Suk is entering the door maze.]

483
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,410
What?

484
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,920
Is this a maze?

485
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,050
[Jae Suk's location]

486
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,810
Gwon Yeol, where are you?

487
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,330
[Even the VJ is lost at the maze.]
What's this?

488
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,960
This is...

489
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,730
this is a real maze!

490
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,440
I think I came the wrong way.
It's a dead end!

491
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,490
[Total panic]

492
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,840
This door is blocked!

493
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,150
Gwon Yeol!

494
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,920
[The VJ is still lost.]
I'm back to where I was!

495
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,620
I can't get out of this maze!

496
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,530
What are we doing today?

497
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,690
[While Yoo Hyuk is roaming,
someone is approaching.]

498
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,050
<i>Where are you going?</i>

499
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,610
Jae Suk!
[Gary seems like he's not far.]

500
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,430
What, what, what is this?

501
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,340
Why are doing this to me?

502
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,410
[Everything is going as I planned...]

503
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,590
[Paper toss]
Start!

504
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,020
Just throw it.

505
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,620
This is sticky.

506
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,260
[But it's...]

507
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,030
- It's difficult.
- It's not easy, it's giving me tears.

508
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,530
I thought it's going to be easy,
but I was wrong.

509
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,490
Whoever gets it in first
will escape the room first.

510
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,540
No, I don't want it.

511
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,310
I think we'll be able to do it soon.

512
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,980
[Focus and throw]

513
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,480
[Goal in!]

514
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,680
Hurry up!
Get it in!

515
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,790
Throw it at the direction.

516
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,990
Face your hand at the
direction of the bin.

517
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,020
That's right!
[He's nagging again!]

518
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,960
[There isn't much time left,
but he keeps failing.]

519
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,430
[They've succeeded at it!]

520
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,970
[He's more surprised.]

521
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,830
Success!
[Tiger and Giraffe completed it.]

522
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,300
We need to decide who'll get out.

523
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,810
Like you said, I tossed it in first.

524
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,180
[He said he doesn't want it,
but he's changed his mind.]

525
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,250
[Bickering]
What are you talking about?

526
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,820
Once you decided to go out,
I guess that's what will happen.

527
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,450
But it's unfair.

528
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,350
You said "whoever gets it in first
will escape the room first."

529
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,990
And I put it in first.

530
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,790
Of course, I have to escape first.

531
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,290
According to what you said.

532
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,360
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Will you play?

533
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,390
Let's try that.

534
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,430
Rock-paper-scissors!
Rock-paper-scissors!

535
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,230
[Kkuk - scissors]
[Giraffe - paper]

536
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,370
[Clearly, it's Kkuk's victory]

537
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,010
[Being grumpy]

538
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,610
[Kwang Soo can't control his anger.]

539
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,090
It'll match with your sweater!

540
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,250
[Was he going to pour on him?]

541
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,650
[I hate you!]

542
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,190
You wanted to play rock-paper-scissors!

543
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,060
You said who gets in first
will leave here first.

544
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,960
Then you wanted to play
rock-paper-scissors, so we did.

545
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Right?

546
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,460
Just get out of my face!

547
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,430
[He's about to explode!]

548
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,160
Get out!
Get out of my house!

549
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,170
Cameras, get out you, too!

550
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,740
I'll leave.
It was fun.

551
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,270
I could do it
because I was with you.

552
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,070
Should I play a game by myself?

553
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,910
What's that?

554
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,550
It's a maze!

555
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,690
No exit?

556
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,590
[He starts exploring the maze.]

557
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,860
When you're inside the maze,
don't go to the easy path.

558
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,360
If it looks like an exit,
it turns out that it's not.

559
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,930
The floor isn't going to sink
or something like that.

560
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,270
[Will Mr. Capable be able to exit?]

561
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,440
[At that moment, a mysterious
shade is approaching.]

562
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,950
What's that?

563
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,290
[Who are they?]
Why are you doing this?

564
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,890
[They eliminated Mr. Capable's
name tag in a flash!]

565
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,810
[They're hunters!]

566
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,290
[Where are the hunters
taking the members?]

567
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,950
[After four hours of missions,
Kim Jong Kook is ousted.]

568
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,230
[What will the jail look like
hidden inside the maze?]

569
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,180
It's Jong Kook.
[Mr. Capable was captured, too?]

570
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,600
[Where are we?]
What is this?

571
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,650
- This is a desert island.
- Is that?

572
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,740
Roll the two dice, and escape
when you have matching numbers.

573
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,780
If you get two different numbers,
you need to wait 10 minutes.

574
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,810
We're waiting now.

575
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,380
I really want to get out of here!

576
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,380
- I want to get out.
- I'll get out this time.

577
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,160
[Giraffe who was captured quickly
came to the desert island, too.]

578
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,960
So, this is like a jail?

579
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,090
Jae Suk, we've thought about it.

580
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:08,640
And we think there's a Jigsaw among us.
(From the movie "Saw.")

581
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,120
- Really?
- Then, it mustn't be Ji Hyo.

582
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,740
She keeps saying it.

583
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,960
[One of us made this maze?]

584
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,360
Suk Jin isn't Jigsaw, but Jig-goo.
(Honest and straight)

585
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,350
- Next up!
- If it's 10 or under...

586
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,160
Under 10, under 5, or under 4...

587
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,870
It went on the wrong side.
Kick it.

588
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,060
Kick it?
[You must be in a hurry.]

589
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,540
[Suk Jin tries next.]

590
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,570
I did it!

591
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,380
[They match.]

592
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,980
Wait.

593
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,580
This drives me crazy.

594
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,480
[Ha Ha attempts to escape.]

595
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,380
Four.

596
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,210
You did it.

597
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,560
Okay!

598
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,780
I could tell he was going to make it.

599
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,160
I couldn't escape from here once.

600
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,030
Ha Ha keeps escaping from here.

601
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,330
What will happen if
I walk out from this door?

602
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,930
What's that?

603
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm scared.

604
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,230
[The hunters are watching him
at a close distance!]

605
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,850
[Anxious]

606
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,790
[Scream]

607
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,790
Don't go that way,
he got caught here.

608
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,660
[Ha Ha escapes through the other door.]

609
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,030
[Running fast]
I'll roll the dice!

610
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,900
[He moves quickly,
avoiding the hunters.]

611
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,140
[But where is the exit anyway?]

612
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,250
[Did he finally find the exit?]

613
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,720
Isn't this the big room?

614
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,190
I need to get out.

615
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,630
What?
I was just checking the room.

616
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,400
I just came to check to see
if everything was okay.

617
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,070
Don't do this to me.

618
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,800
[There's already a mission for Ha Ha.]

619
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,540
No!
[This must be a dream!]

620
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,040
No!

621
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,320
[Please tell me this is not reality.]

622
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,680
I was here four hours ago.

623
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,420
Do you know how long I've
been rolling the dice?

624
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,090
What kind of return is this?

625
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,120
[Domino Toppling]

626
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,890
[Pop a ball by playing domino toppling
with the books in the bookshelf.]

627
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,930
[If you want to escape,
complete the mission!]

628
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
[Blow]

629
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,670
[He sets the target!]

630
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,140
[What he needs now is speed!]

631
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:13,340
[Why did I look for trouble?]

632
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,950
Three, four, five, six!

633
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,790
[He needs to put 10 books
and pop the balloon!]

634
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,060
I'm too short for this!

635
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,100
It'll begin when I drop this book!

636
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,530
[Domino toppling begins!]

637
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,440
[Will his effort get him a good result?]

638
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,410
[Balloon, please pop!]

639
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,650
[He fails at the mission.]

640
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,320
[What kind of a balloon are you?]

641
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,860
[Will you resist
if I do this?]

642
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,030
[This is extremely frustrating!]

643
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,600
[Carried away]

644
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,470
The balloon resisted!

645
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,780
[Nothing is working out.]

646
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,240
Maybe you should have
gone the other way.

647
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,810
- That's where the rooms are.
- That way?

648
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,150
[The rest of the members
escaped the island together.]

649
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,850
I'll carry you on my shoulders.

650
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,950
- That's good.
- Look and find where they are.

651
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,760
Can you see them?

652
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,400
There are doors there, there, and there.
There's an exit.

653
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,560
[So, there's an exit.]

654
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,800
Two of them are coming this way!

655
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,370
[Warnings, warnings!]

656
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,090
- Go to that way.
- Come this way!

657
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,640
[Should I see where they are?]

658
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,460
[He was discovered!]
[Evacuate!]

659
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,860
[Kwang Soo and Gary escape
through the crawling maze.]

660
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,130
They're behind us!

661
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,570
[The hunters are dashing
to the entrance of the maze.]

662
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,040
- Gary!
- Kwang Soo!

663
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,870
Be careful!

664
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,980
Wait for me, Gary!

665
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,550
[That was close.]

666
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,750
[the hunters are approaching again.]

667
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,720
[There they are.]

668
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,790
[They're about to be found!]

669
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,390
[Are they gone?]

670
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,730
[Let's run away!]

671
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,840
[They run toward the
crawling maze, too.]

672
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,810
What is it today?

673
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,810
[Why do we have to be chased away?]

674
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,280
My knees hurt!

675
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,050
Kwang Soo!

676
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,580
Gary!

677
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,120
What the heck!

678
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,220
What is this race about?

679
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,320
The hunters are right in front of us.

680
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,330
Should I go up and check?

681
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,560
[Where are you, hunters?]

682
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,500
They're on this side.

683
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,070
[Walking around]

684
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,240
- Let's go!
- Should we run?

685
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,570
One, two, three!

686
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:40,680
Let's go!
[Running toward the exit]

687
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,820
[Ha Ha is still wandering
after escaping from the big room.]

688
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,020
[Careful, careful]

689
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,800
[The hunters are attacking!]

690
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,980
[Oh my god!]

691
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,720
[They can't get out of
the clutches of the hunters.]

692
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,710
[Yoo Jae Suk, to the desert island!]

693
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,780
Wait a minute, wait!

694
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,250
I just came out!
I came out from the room just now!

695
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,050
I said I just came out!
[Ha Ha, to the desert island!]

696
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,020
Why are you doing this, all of a sudden?

697
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,990
[The hunters make Mr. Capable give in!]

698
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,130
Why are you doing this to me?

699
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,250
[Kim Jong Kook, to the desert island!]

700
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,100
[The hunters of the maze appear!]

701
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,270
Run, run!

702
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,850

Like I said before, there's
one problem to be solved.

877
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:42,870
There should be a way
for the members to win the race.

878
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,760
If you get caught, or...

879
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:51,830
there should be a way
for them to win the race.

880
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,370
So, it makes a fair
game for the members.

881
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,320
This has to be a confrontation anyway.

882
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,770
I'll follow the rules

883
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:11,210
that you think it's fair.

884
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,720
I see, then we'll review it later.

885
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,250
Let me suggest one thing.

886
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,720
The winning condition is

887
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,960
to bring the six members
except you to the last room.

888
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,650
That's your winning condition.

889
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,720
I see.

890
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,780
If they don't go to the room

891
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,760
or if the indicator such as an armband
or an ankle band is revealed.

892
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,440
Then, I'll admit it as I'm defeated.

893
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,090
We're not responsible for that.

894
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:43,070
Don't worry it.
I'm very confident.

895
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,520
[Don't worry about me!
I'll win!]

896
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,090
It shouldn't look like me.

897
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,010
You will film only the
upper part, right?

898
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,560
[For a perfect revenge,
he's acting as a masked-man.]

899
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,320
- You'll change my voice, too.
- Yes.

900
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,580
Like the movie, "Saw."

901
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,360
Yes, I like that.

902
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,130
Do I look like me?

903
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:11,120
I shouldn't look like me.

904
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,810
People say it still look like me,
when I'm wearing a fish mask.

905
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,870
It is obvious?

906
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,430
[Finally, it's d-day!]

907
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,180
[They're waiting to enter the hall.]

908
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,610
It's strange, see?

909
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,920
Are you a spy?

910
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,700
It's just beginning.

911
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,670
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

912
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,960
Why is Kwang Soo last one to enter?

913
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,230
Why did you put me at the end?

914
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,780
Of course, they think it's strange
because we never do that.

915
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,210
[At the crucial moment]

916
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,010
[he chose "revenge."]

917
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,630
[Grin]

918
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:05,340
[When he chose revenge,
an armband is given to him.]

919
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,050
[He's wearing it on his arm.]

920
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,630
[In the small room]
Are you the one?

921
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,530
Are you Jigsaw?

922
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:17,540
Are you Jigsaw from the movie "Saw"?

923
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,970
What are you talking about?
I don't really know...

924
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,610
His acting was pretty natural this time.

925
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:31,470
[The room escape missions were going on]

926
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,480
[and the members were getting stressed.]

927
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,490
We did it!

928
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,890
[Bickering]

929
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,360
[The stress goes up!]

930
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,300
You guys are sensitive!

931
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,540
[Good, this is exactly what I planned!]

932
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,090
[He made them suffer]

933
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,340
[and sent them to
the maze one by one...]

934
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:01,080
[The designer is left alone.]

935
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,050
What's this nonsense?

936
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,220
[He starting to overact.]
So frustrating!

937
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,620
[Then, he moves
to the corner of the room.]

938
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,360
[And escapes through the secret path.]

939
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:23,470
[He opens the secret door,
and it's the outside of the maze.]

940
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,010
This is fun.

941
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,410
They're working so hard.

942
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,720
In such a small room,
they must have felt stuffy.

943
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,120
It's a lot of trouble.

944
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,250
[While the rest of the members
are struggling in the maze]

945
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,050
[Kwang Soo is very relaxed.]

946
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,400
[Quick steps]

947
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,630
[The place he walked
at a quick pace is...]

948
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,040
[the monitor room.]

949
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,050
[And the password is]

950
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,940
Asia Prince!

951
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:17,810
[Inside, there's high-tech equipment
that he can see the whole maze!]

952
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,030
[A comfortable chair
and some refreshments]

953
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,770
<i>What is that we're doing today?</i>

954
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:36,640
[He's watching the members while
enjoying the refreshment.]

955
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,340
<i>This drives me crazy!</i>

956
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,840
I think the crawling maze is the worst.

957
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,870
Good riddance!

958
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,470
Now, I can sleep at night.

959
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,920
[Kwang Soo is expressing his spite.]
Such a hard work!

960
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,250
They've been wandering
in the maze for hours.

961
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,030
And they still couldn't
finish the mission.

962
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,630
Why does no one think it's strange?

963
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,630
Are they all stupid?

964
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,000
Why did you go there?
It's on your left, you fool!

965
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,010
[While he enjoys the joy of
designing the maze to the fullest...]

966
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,050
There's no exit!

967
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:21,050
[The members are flat on their back
while the hunters attack.]

968
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,080
[The members were
captured by the hunters.]

969
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,920
[and went to the deserted
island one by one.]

970
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,820
<i>Do they even know what they're doing?</i>

971
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,920
Try rolling the dice
as much as you want.

972
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,340
There's nothing you can do.

973
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,630
I think I'll have a good
night's sleep for years.

974
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,580
I'm too immersed in.

975
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,870
[He's low on sugar.]

976
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,980
[He starts eating snacks immediately.]

977
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,680
Why am I sweating so much?

978
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,020
[What a dreamy moment!]

979
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,420
[The rest of the members are
gathered on the island one by one.]

980
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:10,090
I'm going to go check
at the desert island.

981
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,530
[He casually drinks his drinks.]

982
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,830
[Scream]

983
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,200
[He's acting like he was
just attacked by the hunters.]

984
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,320
I need someone to drag me there.

985
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,850
[He wants to look like he was
captured by a hunter.]

986
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,430
[He runs the shortest distance]

987
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,620
[through the giant maze
everyone wandered about.]

988
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:47,130
[Crossing the small room
that's getting ready for filming]

989
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,130
[he arrives at the
desert island in a burst.]

990
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,770
Where are the hunters?

991
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,810
They're over there!

992
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,240
This is designed for my height,
so I can see them from here.

993
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,450
Come over here.

994
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,590
Be gentle!

995
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,850
Ahhh!
What's this?

996
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,960
[He puts his heart and soul
to act like he's ousted.]

997
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,900
What's going on?

998
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:30,690
[As he's getting near
the desert island]

999
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,070
Dong Hun!

1000
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,160
[he's restraining
his facial expressions.]

1001
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,980
Did they rip your name tag?

1002
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,920
[And going back to the
maze he designed.]

1003
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,580
[Welcome to Kwang Soo's maze!]

1004
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,490
Don't you think the
designer is among us?

1005
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,940
I know who it is.

1006
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,870
[He knows who the designer is?]

1007
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,160
[Ha Ha, it's you!]
I'm tired of this!

1008
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,490
[It wasn't me.]

1009
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,970
[His legs gave way
with nervous tension.]

1010
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,450
It's not me!

1011
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,410
I don't know who he is,
but he's stupid.

1012
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,080
He must be a psycho.
[He's putting it bluntly out of stress.]

1013
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,340
[Wait and see,
you'll see what real stress is!]

1014
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:28,320
[Rule - Roll the dice and escape,
when you get "escape."

1015
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,800
Okay, escape!

1016
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,030
Escape!

1017
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,960
The probability is only one sixth.

1018
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,760
[Escape]

1019
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,540
[They escape the deserted
island one by one.]

1020
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,810
- Ji Hyo, hurry and escape.
- See you, Jae Suk.

1021
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,710
[Entering the maze again]

1022
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,350
What's this?

1023
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,810
Gwon Yeol, this maze is so frustrating.

1024
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:58,460
[The maze is still full of hunters.]

1025
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,630
Think about it, there's
got to be something.

1026
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,230
Like a clue or something.

1027
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,670
Just wandering in the maze
won't solve anything.

1028
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,370
Jong Kook.
[Can you release me?]

1029
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,780
Maybe we need to eliminate
someone's name tag.

1030
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,140
Hunter's name tag?

1031
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,610
- Should we try?
- Let's try that.

1032
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,040
Let's do that and see what happens.

1033
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,350
- Then what?
- There could be a hint.

1034
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,380
Jae Suk is coming.

1035
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,120
- Hunter's name tag...
- There are so many hunters still.

1036
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,860
We should try and fight against hunters.

1037
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,490
- They have name tags.
- There might be clues.

1038
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,780
Let's pick one person.

1039
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,850
You'll lose if you don't throw,
rock-paper-scissors!

1040
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,120
Rick-paper-scissors!

1041
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,720
[Everyone else throws scissors,
Kwang Soo throws paper.]

1042
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,450
Okay, it's you, Kwang Soo.

1043
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,410
[His bad luck is something
we need to memorialize.]

1044
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,720
[Kwang Soo is obliged to
eliminate the hunters' name tag.]

1045
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,800
It's better for you to hold,
so Jong Kook can rip it.

1046
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,270
[Peek]

1047
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,780
[It's the hunter!]

1048
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,130
[What are you doing, Kwang Soo?
You need to rip his name tag!]

1049
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:17,230
[While Kwang Soo is hesitating]

1050
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,050
[Running Man and
the hunters' all-out war!]

1051
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,270
Kwang Soo, rip his name tag!

1052
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,780
I'm holding him.
Rip his name tag!

1053
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,810
[Kwang Soo keeps touching his name tag.]
It seems there's something!

1054
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,760
It's suspicious.
Take it off, Gary!

1055
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,120
They're resisting!

1056
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,560
[And finally, Ace Blank Ji
comes forward.]

1057
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,290
[She rips his name tag.]
There is!

1058
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,530
There really is a hint!

1059
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:50,690
[What is that?]

1060
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,800
<i>Like I said before,
there's one problem to be solved.</i>

1061
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,340
<i>There should be a way
for the members to win the race.</i>

1062
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,910
<i>If you get caught, or...</i>

1063
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,910
<i>[So it's a fair game.]
This has to be a confrontation.</i>

1064
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:12,950
<i>I'll follow the rules,
that you think it's fair.</i>

1065
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,160
[So the production crew
set a very fair rule.]

1066
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,600
[Mok]

1067
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:29,870
["Lee," "Kwang," "Soo," "Pal,"
and "Mok"] (Palmok means wrist)

1068
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:35,740
[The game is over as
soon as he gets caught.]

1069
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,650
[Do they think this is fair?]

1070
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,670
[They are excited
to find a new hint.]

1071
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,880
Let's go attack them.

1072
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,450
This is no time for us to remain idle.

1073
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,420
Let's go fight them back!

1074
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,010
[What should I do?]

1075
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:56,010
- Hunters can be eliminated!
- Hunters are running away!

1076
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,720
[The hunters are avoiding
the Running Man for now.]

1077
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,140
They went under the net.
The net is shaking.

1078
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,780
- It's the big room.
- No, it's not.

1079
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,120
Don't go in!
It's the big room!

1080
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,560
[He's entered already.]
Good job!

1081
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,270
What is this?
[Jae Suk enters the big room.]

1082
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,230
[Welcome to the big room.]

1083
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,870
This room also has the same thing.

1084
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,520
[There are the same clocks?]

1085
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:29,690
[Ha Ha was wondering around
and locked up in the small room.]

1086
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,330
[You were here, Ha Ha.]
I need to finish this mission.

1087
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,840
- Why did you go in?
- My name tag was eliminated.

1088
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Really?

1089
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,180
[Kwang Soo forcibly entered the room.]

1090
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,720
[And Big-nose joins them!]
Seriously!

1091
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,160
Three of us again?
[It's Easy Brothers!]

1092
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,560
What is it?
Is there something else?

1093
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,520
We ripped a hunter's name tag,
and there was a hint.

1094
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,920
- The hint says "mok."
- What does it mean?

1095
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,920
- This "mok"?
- Yes, that "mok."

1096
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,740
It could be "mok yoil."
(Thursday)

1097
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,380
[The hint is not very clear.]

1098
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,490
[What a relief!]

1099
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:10,810
Seoul, Paris, New York,
London, and Shanghai...

1100
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:14,240
- Seo-pa-new-lon-shang...
- Isn't that suspicious?

1101
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,580
[His eye shift fast
as soon as they start guessing.]

1102
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,240
What time is it now?

1103
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,180
- It's...
- That's 9:30...

1104
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,470
[The clocks look more
and more suspicious.]

1105
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:32,070
I'll accept if you make a condition
for me to be defeated.

1106
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,010
[The second, very fair rule
that production crews prepared.]

1107
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,260
[Each room in the maze has a hint that
indicates the designer of the maze.]

1108
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:44,690
[K, S]
[Kwang Soo]

1109
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:54,210
[Light Room]
[Light Kwang]

1110
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,850
[Soo]

1111
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,320
Really, there's something
about the clock?

1112
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,560
Were there the clocks
in the small room?

1113
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,980
Yes, and they're the same.

1114
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,120
They're suspicious.

1115
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,690
[Thinking]

1116
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,290
[Will the clue be upside down]

1117
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,180
[There must be something...
What is it?]

1118
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:24,520
The time difference between
Seoul and Shanghai is one hour.

1119
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,560
[With wrong time difference]
But the minutes don't match.

1120
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,340
Look at the eight o'clock.
Doesn't it look like seven o'clock?

1121
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,580
The clock for Shanghai.

1122
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,920
It's eight o'clock.
The large hand doesn't...

1123
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,880
Huh, is that seven?

1124
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,420
That's weird, too.

1125
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,060
Maybe this is not about time.

1126
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,260
- Maybe it's a direction.
- The way we can escape the maze?

1127
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,660
Jong Kook, I don't think that's it.

1128
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,600
I think the hint "mok" was for
an animal with a long neck. (mok)

1129
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,070
If you look at the clocks.

1130
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,490
Only Seoul and Shanghai
could be read as K and S.

1131
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,970
They're in Asia.

1132
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,740
Kwang Soo?

1133
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,650
Maybe I'm too stuck with this idea
that it could be Kwang Soo but...

1134
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,690
[Mr. Random Capable's keen reasoning]

1135
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,650
This game cannot be designed
without a spy.

1136
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,470
Clearly, this is to trick us.

1137
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,060
I think that's K and S.

1138
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,850
Kwang Soo, can we rip his name tag?

1139
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,700
Seriously, could it be his revenge
for the hidden camera?

1140
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,290
But he's been ripped a lot of times.

1141
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,900
Balmok, sonmok... (ankle, wrist)

1142
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,940
I've also thought about
an armband and an ankle band.

1143
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,210
Don't we need to be in one spot?

1144
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,610
Jae Suk, let's do the mission
and get out of the room.

1145
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,520
[Mission - organize the giant book
in alphabetical order.]

1146
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,880
[The four people are working together.]

1147
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,070
[And they completed
the mission in no time.]

1148
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:51,870
- We did it.
- Is that a success?

1149
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,760
One person will go out and wait.

1150
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,790
It has to be at least three,
so we can attack.

1151
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,090
Why don't you go out first?

1152
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,810
Okay, I'll be waiting outside,
so hurry up and come out.

1153
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,320
We need three people at least.

1154
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,670
[They're doing the mission
in the small room, too.]

1155
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:09,230
Hook it on the dress!

1156
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,210
That's right!
Lift it!

1157
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,890
- Bravo!
- Only one can leave.

1158
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:16,610
54 seconds.

1159
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:20,780
[Let me get out first!]

1160
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,780
I'm already out!

1161
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,890
I knew that's going to happen.

1162
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,360
[This is not the right time
to be locked up.]

1163
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,780
[On the other side]

1164
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,740
[Finally, Jae Suk
escapes from the big room.]

1165
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:48,520
- No one from the small room escaped?
- I called out, but no one answered.

1166
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,360
Let's think, Jae Suk.

1167
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,740
- Let's think carefully.
- This is crazy.

1168
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,880
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook
start solving the mystery.]

1169
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,120
Seoul...
I looked at the letters, too.

1170
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:04,500
[At that moment,
the hunters are out in force.]

1171
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,360
[They're ready for combat!]

1172
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,540
[Crowded]

1173
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,180
So many of you came.

1174
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,830
You're too many!

1175
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,850
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook
stick to the corner.]

1176
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:17,040
Good.

1177
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,720
Move to the side.
Come to the corner!

1178
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,610
[Action!]

1179
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:28,280
[The hunters are struggling against
Mr. Capable and Yoo-ruce Willis.]

1180
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,430
[At that moment!]

1181
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:36,160
[A hunter suddenly
attacks from up on the wall.]

1182
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,390
[But!]

1183
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,940
[Jump!]
[Rip]

1184
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,890
It's "soo."

1185
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,830
[Mr. Capable rips the
hunter's name tag off.]

1186
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:47,540
This time, it's "soo."

1187
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,810
I think we need to rip all of them.
From Monday to Sunday!

1188
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,410
[You said it's "soo"?]
Then it's Kwang Soo!

1189
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,940
Mok (Thursday), and soo (Wednesday)...

1190
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,980
- Seriously, it's Kwang Soo.
- Do you think so?

1191
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,630
Wol, hwa, soo, mok, geum, to, il.
(Days of the week)

1192
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,850
That's a fake.

1193
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:13,030
Think, the clock of
the cities in Asia...

1194
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:16,120
[Wait, that's right!]

1195
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,540
[K and S in the cities in Asia.]

1196
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:29,930
[And all the titles of the giant books
contain "prince."]

1197
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:32,040
[The Frog Prince],
[The Little Prince], [The Happy Prince]

1198
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,310
[The Swan Prince],
[The Prince and the Pauper]

1199
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:37,920
[Asia, and prince...]
Asia Prince!

1200
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,980
[Asia Prince]

1201
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,270
[The Asia Prince
among Running Man members is]

1202
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:49,030
[Lee Kwang Soo]

1203
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,890
[Gary solves the mystery perfectly.]

1204
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,410
With a long "mok" (neck)

1205
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,510
"soo" is from his name Kwang Soo.

1206
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,600
Kwang Soo with a long neck?

1207
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,700
[Kwang Soo with a long neck?]

1208
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,340
[That Kwang Soo with a long neck
is listening behind the door.]

1209
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,340
[Mental breakdown]

1210
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,290
[In a hurry]

1211
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:13,810
[The arm band for the "designer"]

1212
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,150
[he's wearing it tightly
in case someone checks.]

1213
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,490
[Then he goes straight to the
monitor room through the secret path.]

1214
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,510
What happened?

1215
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:28,460
[Emergency!]
Are there any more hunters?

1216
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,700
Is that it?

1217
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,500
[All the hunters are called out.]

1218
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,770
Over there.

1219
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:39,940
Where can we reach the last room?

1220
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,310
<i>The winning condition is</i>

1221
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:46,380
<i>to bring the six members
except you to the last room.</i>

1222
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,890
<i>If they don't go to the room</i>

1223
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:56,590
<i>or if the indicator such as an armband
or an ankle band is revealed.</i>

1224
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:00,700
<i>Then I'll take it
as I am defeated.</i>

1225
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,830
[There's no time!]

1226
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:10,340
[Before my identity is revealed, I need
to put the members in the last room.]

1227
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,080
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo!

1228
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,410
Did you escape?

1229
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:18,910
- Let's stick together.
- Is Kwang Soo out?

1230
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:22,450
[He joins the members hastily.]
Come over here, Kwang Soo.

1231
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:24,650
Bring Kwang Soo over here.

1232
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,120
What were you doing, Kwang Soo?

1233
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,060
How did you escape the room?
[He's suspicious.]

1234
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,090
[They're surrounding Kwang Soo
from the both sides.]

1235
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,160
Search Kwang Soo's neck.

1236
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,630
I have no idea.

1237
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,270
[That's the spot]

1238
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:49,110
[that he tied the armband.]

1239
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:55,520
[If he's caught, the game is over.]

1240
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,390
[He isn't wearing anything?]

1241
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,960
Check his wrist and ankle.

1242
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:06,010
[But they're still doubting.]

1243
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:10,060
[I need to bring them to the last room.]

1244
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,500
I think that's the last room.

1245
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:19,110
What's that?
What does "fin" mean?

1246
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:21,870
[That's the last room for the mission.]

1247
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,890
Don't we need to go to the room?

1248
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,250
There's no way.

1249
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,830
[The members are walking
toward the last room.]

1250
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,580
There's a way, but...

1251
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,220
<i>The winning condition is</i>

1252
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:37,820
<i>to bring the six members
except you to the last room.</i>

1253
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,160
[Walk along with them and
put them in the last room first.]

1254
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,730
[At this rate, I can win...]

1255
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,730
- This side is open.
- But, that's not connected.

1256
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,960
- We need to go through here.
- There's a way!

1257
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,100
- Is that connected?
- It is!

1258
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,030
[Ha Ha found the exit.]

1259
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,940
It's open!

1260
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,710
[Finally, they arrive at the last room.]

1261
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,810
Let's get in!

1262
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:06,880
[Kwang Soo will win if he lets
them enter the room first.]

1263
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,180
- What's this?
- There are seven seats.

1264
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,790
Isn't that a prison?

1265
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,720
[They're entering doubtlessly.]

1266
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,160
Are you sure there are seven seats?

1267
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,770
[Everyone, please enter the room.]

1268
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:25,250
Let's get inside.

1269
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,500
- Are we supposed to get in?
- I don't know.

1270
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,070
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to get in.

1271
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,510
Kwang Soo, why are you resisting?

1272
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,810
- Kwang Soo opened his mouth.
- Kwang Soo did?

1273
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:40,380
- Something happened to Kwang Soo?
- No, he was resisting.

1274
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,350
I want to go check that room.

1275
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,590
I went inside.
Three of you were outside, right?

1276
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,790
[Kwang Soo is acting suspicious.]

1277
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:53,760
[Let's put him inside!]

1278
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,670
[Kwang Soo is resisting death.]

1279
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:05,270
[No, I almost won the race!]

1280
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:09,340
[Kwang Soo becomes
super strong all of a sudden.]

1281
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,480
What's going on?

1282
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:17,420
[I can't end it like this!]

1283
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,590
<i>I will take revenge no matter what!</i>

1284
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,450
<i>I will take revenge in person,
if you don't let me on Running Man.</i>

1285
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,230
<i>It's a maze.</i>

1286
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:28,730
<i>It's a maze, right at this place.</i>

1287
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,770
<i>I will have my revenge today.</i>

1288
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,500
<i>Everything is all set!</i>

1289
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
<i>Be strong, everyone!</i>

1290
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,610
<i>One, two, three, fight!
That's very good!</i>

1291
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,640
[From designing the maze
to educating the hunters]

1292
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:43,670
[Everything went as I planned]

1293
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,610
[and I could have won the race...]

1294
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:50,120
<i>This is really close to
what I wanted to achieve.</i>

1295
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,520
<i>Good riddance!</i>

1296
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,420
[Why am I doing this here?]

1297
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,490
I'll go inside the room!

1298
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,830
Why is he resisting?

1299
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,720
[It's a weird situation
for the people who]

1300
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,630
[don't know Kwang Soo's
winning condition.]

1301
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,430
[They don't know the rules]

1302
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:10,440
[but they join forces
and move Kwang Soo together.]

1303
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,270
Yes, he's inside.

1304
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,710
Why did you resist?

1305
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:18,440
[Kwang Soo loses.]
There was something!

1306
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,310
I had a feeling.

1307
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,310
What is it?

1308
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:22,980
He's so strong!

1309
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,950
There's no other reason that
he would resist this much.

1310
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:29,890
The clocks for the Asia, K and S.
[Kwang Soo's revenge fails.]

1311
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,450
Asia Prince.

1312
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:35,030
- What was written on the clock?
- K and S.

1313
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:37,560
[Everyone is completely exhausted
from the maze.]

1314
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,630
I kept saying it's Kwang Soo,
ever since I saw the letter "mok."

1315
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,430
- What about "soo"?
- Kwang "Soo."

1316
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,490
Oh, Kwang "Soo."

1317
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:48,040
I thought it's really suspicious,
so I told him to get inside.

1318
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,960
Then, he resisted so hard.

1319
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,540
[Even at the last moment,
Kwang Soo was caught by Gary.]

1320
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,380
See, he has it.
[The armband for the "designer."]

1321
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,230
The designer?

1322
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:02,360
So the "mok" means...

1323
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,890
"son-mok" and "bal-mok"
(wrist and ankle)

1324
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:07,070
Where did you hide this?

1325
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:09,430
I checked his arms, too.

1326
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,850
- But I couldn't feel it.
- I was wearing it really tight.

1327
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:18,140
Since I was so close to winning the race,
I couldn't control my face.

1328
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,050
I saw his mouth opened.

1329
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,570
So we lose, if we all came in?

1330
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:23,560
All inside the room but me.

1331
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,120
[If it wasn't for Gary,
Kwang Soo could have won easily.]

1332
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,810
This is frustrating!

1333
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:32,140
He was resisting
and changed his attitude.

1334
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:38,760
[We won!]

1335
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,160
My goal was to make everyone stressed.
That was my only goal.

1336
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,830
We were really stressed.

1337
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,050
- It was really stressful.
- Then, that's enough.

1338
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:50,360
- So, what happens now?
- Kwang Soo's plan failed.

1339
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:56,410
- You can decide a punishment for him.
- You never told me that before.

1340
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,160
- Getting a forehead slap from Jae Suk.
- We didn't talk about it.

1341
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,050
- Forehead slap.
- How about this?

1342
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:06,270
He will go through the crawling maze,
and he gets a slap when he gets up.

1343
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:09,690
This is better. That forehead
slap will replace the clapper.

1344
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:11,560
The last clapper?

1345
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,210
Why slap my forehead
for the clap sound?

1346
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,870
Say "we'll clap the slate!"
right before the slap.

1347
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,090
You don't have to go that way.

1348
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,360
- Come this way.
- Oh, we can?

1349
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,630
You know the way.

1350
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,160
Where's your room?

1351
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,770
[They're walking on
Kwang Soo's personal path.]

1352
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,380
You were resisting too hard.

1353
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,920
I didn't think Gary could have
known what's going on.

1354
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,080
I just thought he's not here.

1355
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,290
Gary noticed really early.

1356
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:46,850
- Since when did you doubt me?
- From the beginning.

1357
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,140
This is my monitor room.

1358
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,320
Why do you knock?
It's your room.

1359
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,890
- I need to say the password.
- Password, please.

1360
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,400
Asia...
Asia Prince.

1361
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,870
This is not what I set.

1362
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,700
I'm not lying.
They told me the password.

1363
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,920
That's too much!

1364
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,810
- I didn't set the password.
- So, this is it?

1365
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,840
He was eating snacks.

1366
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,510
[This is it!]

1367
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,080
He ate some pastries.

1368
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:16,550
Just by looking at the maze,
I feel stuffy.

1369
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,890
[But why is everyone here?]

1370
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,790
I thought I solved the maze.

1371
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:25,360
[This is giving me stress.]

1372
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,520
[They arrive at the crawling maze.]

1373
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,320
This is so frustrating!

1374
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,740
This is frustrating!

1375
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,810
I was going crazy when
I was at a dead end.

1376
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,850
[Everybody's talking
about how bad it is.]

1377
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,560
This one's really terrible.

1378
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,210
- It's a dead end.
- Dead end.

1379
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,620
Do you know how stressful it is
when you arrive to a dead end?

1380
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,320
<i>This is the low maze.</i>

1381
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,120
<i>You can't go through
