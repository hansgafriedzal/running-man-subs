00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,700
[Come out, come out wherever you are.]

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,740
[Watch out, we're coming to get you.]

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,090
[An assault on "that" man's house!]

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,440
[We'll see how lonely
and pitiful they are.]

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,350
[We're revealing the secret
lives of the men who live alone.]

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,760
[On a rainy autumn morning]

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,930
[the Running Man members
are visiting guests.]

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,450
Hello.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,670
- Hello.
- Good morning.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,630
[Nervous, excited]
I have thick clothing.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,250
[Who are they visiting this early?]
The weather is pretty bad.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,380
This is your partner for today's house.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,030
Their house?
The actual house?

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,150
[A surprise attack at
their partner's house!]

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,310
- This place is...
- Kwang Gyoo's house.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,950
[What just happened?]
Can I re-record it?

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,040
We were filming
"Same Bed Different Dreams" yesterday

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,340
and he said "see you tomorrow."

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,060
I asked him what he was talking about.
He has a big mouth.

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,620
- He's not allowed to tell, right?
- He knows he's going to be on the show.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,400
But he doesn't know that
he's your partner.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,350
This worked out well,
I felt bad.

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
I told him that he could
be a regular member.

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,590
That's why he came last time.
[For the 100 vs. 100 Race]

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,900
He'll know that it's me, by my voice.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,370
[He covers the camera.]

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,480
He's not picking up.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,250
<i>- Who is it?
- See? It's Kwang Gyoo!</i>

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,680
<i>Who is it?</i>

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm your partner for today.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,680
<i>Darn, it's a guy!</i>

33
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,790
Please open the door!

34
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,030
<i>Do I get to be a regular?</i>

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,250
What are you talking about!

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,400
<i>Come in.</i>

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
It's open.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,500
I've never been to Kwang Gyoo's house.

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,180
[May spring bring
abundant joy and happiness.]

40
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,620
It's already winter!

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,990
[Waiting for spring year-round.]
He still has the spring message.

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,000
[The sparkly guy]

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,840
[Kim Kwang Gyoo.]

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,060
[Of all people...]

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,740
[I thought spring was
finally here today.]

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,280
Why did you put this on your door?

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,780
I'm a regular now, right?

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,810
<i>Shiny, shiny.
I liked your shiny eyes.</i>

49
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,520
[Introducing Running Man's
constant guest]

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,380
[Kwang Gyoo's lovely house.]

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,300
[No matter where we look]

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,860
It's winter already!

53
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,560
[it looks like the house of a man
who lives by himself.]

54
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,500
[Tsk, tsk]

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,130
Why did you put cellophane
tape on your window?

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,430
I'm a celebrity.

57
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,650
[It's more eye-catching.]

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,470
What were you trying to peek at?

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,810
Joong Hwan is moving in the
building across from me.

60
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,680
- The building next door.
- Really?

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,520
[The eye-catching items
are laying around.]

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,930
[He uses them... right?]

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,060
Don't leave these out because
there's a cameraman here!

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,220
[It's a bit much for the camera.]

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,500
[You need to be Kkuk-strong
to lift those.]

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,400
What is this?

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,340
[Fall]

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,650
I thought this was a
"Lava" pillow, but it isn't.

69
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,440
It was fuller before.

70
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,520
I feel so bad.

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,620
I had a fever a few days ago.

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,060
You were lying down here with it?

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,160
Why did you have a fever?

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,880
Let's go eat.

75
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,020
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,970
Why do you have so much medicine?

77
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,040
- Are you ill?
- No.

78
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,670
Why is there medicine everywhere?

79
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,110
"If you're living the
same today as yesterday"

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,410
"expecting a different
tomorrow is foolish."

81
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,270
"If you're desperate,
you will find a way."

82
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,850
"There might not be a tomorrow."
Why did you write these?

83
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,220
[Alone, a lonely tomorrow, desperate]

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,740
[and in 2070?]

85
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,980
"I won't be here in 2070?"

86
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,380
Why are you writing these?

87
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,190
Why are you writing these?

88
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,020
I have bad luck this year.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,230
I'm sensitive nowadays.

90
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,600
[The rice is healthy,
multi-grain rice.]

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,170
It's not just white rice.

92
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,760
It's multi-grain rice.

93
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,130
[How long has it been since he's had
someone over for breakfast.]

94
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,310
The eggs are warm.

95
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,420
Thanks for eating with me...

96
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,490
It feels special.

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,730
It totally different than eating alone.

98
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm getting teary-eyed.

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,770
Why is Running Man so sad?

100
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,120
Don't think of me as a
senior who lives alone.

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,540
I wasn't thinking that at all.

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,370
[Sigh...]

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,540
What's wrong with you?

104
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,610
This is such a happy day!

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,980
It's the first time.

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,310
Running Man never
visited my house before.

107
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,490
Are you filming "I Live Alone" today?

108
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
What is this?

109
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,490
Are you sure this is Running Man?

110
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,560
Are you still on "I Live Alone"?

111
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,500
This is Gary's house.

112
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,020
Right?

113
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,390
Am I supposed to go in?

114
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,890
[Ha Ha, the uninvited guest.]

115
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,170
I love going to other people's houses.

116
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,850
Gary's expecting someone to visit.

117
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,750
- He knows?
- He knows, but

118
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,850
he doesn't when or who is coming.

119
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,360
If he's ready, that's a relief.

120
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,720
How come you and Gary aren't
getting along nowadays?

121
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,620
Whenever we did games together,
it was always like that.

122
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,230
It's because we're so close.

123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,120
My new rival Gary is my new partner.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,800
[Will Gary welcome
Ha Ha's sudden visit?]

125
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,230
Do I knock?
Can't I just go in?

126
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,560
[He rings the bell since it's early.]

127
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,980
[Puffy face]

128
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,510
[Gary just got up.]

129
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,830
- Who is it?
- It's me!

130
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,180
[Surprised]

131
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,620
Introducing, Kang Gary's house!

132
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,470
You have so many shoes!

133
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,570
My face is so puffy.

134
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,750
[He deeply sleeping
instead of getting ready.]

135
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,930
[Ta-da]

136
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,620
Are you invading my
house like Kwang Soo's?

137
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,080
This is his studio!

138
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,690
This is where he wrote
"Get Some Air."

139
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,620
I didn't make that song here!

140
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
I'm so curious!
This is his studio!

141
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,260
[Gary's never-before-seen studio.]

142
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,930
This is amazing.

143
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,200
This is where the party's at.

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,160
[He has a built-in
studio in the house.]

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,130
This is where the party's at.

146
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,490
[A place where lots of songs
were written and will be written.]

147
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,330
- It's so nice.
- Why are you here?

148
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,450
[Ha Ha doesn't know why he's here,
but he's having fun.]

149
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,200
This is so uncomfortable!

150
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,890
This is super uncomfortable!

151
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,820
The view is incredible!

152
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,830
What is this?

153
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,120
[Outside the window is an
excellent view of Han River.]

154
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,940
Did you do this on purpose?

155
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,000
Please sit down over there!

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,650
This is the party zone!

157
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,960
[Chaos]

158
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,230
I don't even jump on this sofa!

159
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,610
Oh, so you check stuff in this area?

160
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,700
- This is like a bar!
- There's nothing to eat!

161
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,850
- Let me have a glass of water.
- I'll pour it for you.

162
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,080
What is this?

163
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,610
My face is so puffed up...

164
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,660
[You should have woken up earlier...]

165
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,470
You have ice cream, too.

166
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,550
[Ha Ha briefly lived with him
before he got married.]

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,530
This brings back memories.
I should check the washing machine.

168
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,130
[He gave up.]

169
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,730
He already knew we were coming.

170
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,500
- He cleaned up everything.
- I was going to clean up...

171
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,890
- I was...
- Yes.

172
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,840
That's why you shouldn't
tell him beforehand!

173
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,970
[It was a trap he wasn't expecting.]

174
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,660
I look so ugly.

175
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,710
I should have gotten up earlier.

176
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,710
[They're supposed to
be on their way now.]

177
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,110
You knew that your partner was
going to come today, right?

178
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,750
[This won't do.]

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,490
Let me just wear my sunglasses.

180
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,590
[Gary, who will be handsome momentarily,
and Ha Ha are one team!]

181
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,160
I feel like old people live here.

182
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,200
[Who will be Jong Kook's partner?]

183
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,580
Maybe he gets yogurt drink deliveries.

184
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,080
He takes care of his health.

185
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,800
I guess he drinks one everyday.

186
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,990
- Who is it?
- Sir!

187
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,460
I'm here for a family visit.

188
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,230
How is it a family visit
when I have no kids?

189
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,000
Go away!

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,500
[His voice is familiar...]

191
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,390
Is it Soo Hong?

192
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,000
[Is this Soo Hong's house?]

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Soo Hong!

194
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,740
You live in a nice place!

195
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,300
This is an amazing house.

196
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,620
[An elegant interior.]

197
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,150
[He's organized.]

198
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,650
It's a little big for one man.

199
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,960
Someone is probably hiding.

200
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,920
I thought Jae Suk was going to come
since he knows my house.

201
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,890
But I think we're going to win
because you're here.

202
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,710
Since your house is so nice,
let's take a tour.

203
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,870
Is this "Love House"?

204
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,040
They might be curious.

205
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,620
- I was in a rush...
- Did you put this fruit out for us?

206
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,250
This is my mother's set-up.

207
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,650
She put them there two days ago.

208
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,620
[He's even entering his bedroom?]

209
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,580
- This pillow is good for the health!
- That's right.

210
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,830
This is from my mom.

211
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,850
For good sleep.

212
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,550
But you have two pillows?

213
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,320
[Why are there two pillows in a
house where he lives alone?]

214
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,020
You never know.

215
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,150
[He's already prepared
for married life.]

216
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,510
[He visits his closet.]

217
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,260
[Organized]

218
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,890
- Do you work out...
- If we keep up with this tour

219
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,640
when are we going to
eliminate name tags?

220
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,700
I can't just not look around.

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,040
Who wears this?

222
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Me.

223
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,760
[It's my house, they're my clothes.]

224
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,290
Shall we take a look at the bathroom?

225
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,100
- The bathroom.
- Why are you going there?

226
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,620
There are two toothbrushes!

227
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,000
There's a green and a red!

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,210
No, that is...

229
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,400
[You should answer that question...]

230
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,640
On weekends, I use this one.

231
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,470
I use this on weekends.

232
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,520
[His quick wit surprised himself.]

233
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,070
This one's for weekends.

234
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,790
And this one for the week days.

235
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,020
Why do you have two toothbrushes?

236
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,000
- One's red and one's green.
- I use both of them.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,660
Okay, that's enough.

238
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,910
There's a cleaner bathroom over there.

239
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,850
[We need to go do the mission!]

240
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,370
[Another man
who's dreaming of love.]

241
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,130
- This is their house.
- House?

242
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,000
Where they live?

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,800
This is the house of a famous idol.

244
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,960
[This is the house
where an idol lives?]

245
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,720
You can find out who your partner is.

246
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,960
Is it okay for me to
visit without a gift?

247
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,830
[His lighthearted knock.]

248
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,170
Please put this on your partner.

249
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,640
[But what if it's a girl?]

250
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,620
[It's a guy.]

251
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh... hi, Niel?

252
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,100
You seem very disappointed.

253
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,250
[The charismatic performer
from Teen Top, it's Niel!]

254
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,400
Nice to see you, Niel!

255
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,360
- Are you disappointed?
- No way!

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,110
[Is he the same person?]

257
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,770
Your face was...

258
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,420
No, it's because I was flustered.
Can I come in?

259
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,340
Yes, come in.

260
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,320
[Presenting... Teen Top's dorm.]

261
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,470
[We were curious what the dorm
of an idol would look like.]

262
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,450
[Who knew it was this empty...]

263
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,360
I haven't got anything
in my schedule today.

264
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
- So you're alone?
- Yes.

265
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,960
[Niel's dorm is empty.]

266
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,720
- Are you disappointed?
- I was just surprised.

267
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,910
- We were on the same team last time.
- That's right.

268
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,830
- You remember, right?
- Of course.

269
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,100
- In the rice paddy.
- Yeah, the rice paddy.

270
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,070
[Shall we take a look?]

271
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,890
- Can I look around?
- Yes, of course.

272
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,370
But there's not much.

273
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,580
- Is this a room?
- Yes, it's my room.

274
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,150
[An idol's room.]

275
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,850
Your fans will be curious, too!

276
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,750
Oh, it seems like you stuffed your
clothes in the corner in a hurry.

277
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,070
This is where I usually put my clothes.

278
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,580
[There are clothes here, too?]

279
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,960
I already washed those.

280
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,040
- It's already washed.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,700
[It obviously doesn't look like it.]

282
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,580
[A shocking space
shared between men.]

283
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,960
There are six guys living here.

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,630
Sorry for coming, empty-handed.

285
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,910
- Do you have anything to eat?
- Yes.

286
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,830
Niel, throw this away.

287
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,210
[There's trash on the floor.]

288
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,450
- I can't stand stuff like this.
- That's where the garbage used to be.

289
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,250
What's with this?
What's wrong with you guys?

290
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,400
What's wrong with you guys?

291
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,740
- Why do you live like this?
- We don't eat here.

292
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,470
Don't be mistaken.
We usually don't eat in our dorm.

293
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,120
What is this?

294
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,290
What's wrong with this?
[The pickled radish exploded.]

295
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,100
What's wrong with the pickled radish?

296
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,870
Sorry, I didn't think it'd explode.

297
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,530
- Did it go bad?
- No, it didn't.

298
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,610
It didn't go bad.

299
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,770
It's gone sour!

300
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,750
It's pickled.
Of course it's sour.

301
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,630
Why are the wet wipes so dry?

302
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,870
Let's go grocery shopping.
This isn't the time to be doing this.

303
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,940
[Will he be able to do well with Niel]

304
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,550
[who urgently needs to go grocery
shopping more than anything?]

305
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,000
[Where's the next partner?]

306
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,100
[Ji Hyo came to an agency
instead of a house.]

307
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,770
No one's here...

308
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,440
Huh?
I know this!

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,230
This is Brown Eyed Soul.

310
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,420
Hello.

311
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,170
It's all Brown Eyed Soul!

312
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,190
Am I here to see Young Jun?

313
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,980
There's Jung Yup.

314
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,020
There's Buzz!

315
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,520
Buzz.

316
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,550
Who is it?
I'm so curious now.

317
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,600
Who could it be?

318
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
[It's for sure one of them,
but which one?]

319
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,110
Hello, Kyung Hoon!

320
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,530
[Huh?
It's Min Kyung Hoon!]

321
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,330
[Buzz's vocal, Min Kyung Hoon
is Ji Hyo's partner.]

322
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,280
You're the guest today, right?

323
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,310
It's nice to meet you!

324
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,660
It's been a long time.

325
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,160
[It's been 13 years since his debut.]

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,820
[A skillful vocalist who has
both the looks and the talent.]

327
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,140
[Min Kyung Hoon's first time
on Running Man.]

328
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,530
There's Buzz, and other singers too.

329
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,260
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

330
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,020
He was good at singing and

331
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,750
my sibling was a huge fan.

332
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,670
- Is it a he?
- No, it was my younger sister.

333
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,740
Do you only like girl fans?

334
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,390
[How will the rest of
the day go for them?]

335
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,860
[Another person who
visited an agency.]

336
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,020
[Big Nose's partner is?]

337
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,130
Hello.

338
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,560
My partner is here?

339
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,670
Oh, in the building?

340
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Hello!

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,760
Nice to meet you.

342
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,500
There's Eddy.

343
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,300
[Could it be Eddy Kim,
Ga In or Lim Kim?]

344
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,980
It might be one of these.

345
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,140
[Please let it be Ga In...]

346
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,920
[Or Lim Kim is okay, too.]

347
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,000
[It's Jo Jung Chi.]

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,130
[Oh no...]

349
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,470
[Why are you here...]

350
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,410
Jung Chi, is it you?

351
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,530
[He's also disappointed.]

352
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,560
I'm your partner, today.

353
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,030
Why.. why you...

354
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,880
[Of the many singers
in this agency...]

355
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,380
[And there were
female singers, too...]

356
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,220
I didn't know who would come,
so I made coffee.

357
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,450
You finished it, already.

358
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,610
- I was waiting.
- You waited a lot.

359
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,590
You look a lot weaker than me.

360
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,000
[Whatever the mission is,
will they be okay?]

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,090
[Kwang Gyoo & Jae Suk]
[Soo Hong & Jong Kook] [Niel & Kwang Soo]

362
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,800
[Kyung Hoon & Ji Hyo]
[Jung Chi & Suk Jin] [Gary & Ha Ha]

363
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,210
[They finished breakfast
at Kwang Gyoo's.]

364
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,910
- Go easy.
- No, I can't do that.

365
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,500
I need to make them clean.

366
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,680
With my personality,
I can't just leave them.

367
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
You should clean
the bottom of the sink.

368
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,310
I still cleaned because
you were visiting today.

369
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,720
What?

370
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,570
What have you done?

371
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,160
I cleaned the floor.

372
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,840
- You did?
- Yeah.

373
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,500
What are we doing today?

374
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,860
Today, you will be camping.

375
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,090
- Camping?
- Then why are we at my house?

376
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,560
You will be camping today.

377
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,440
With him?
Alone?

378
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,510
I like the luxurious resorts.

379
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,610
Glamping?
I like that.

380
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,840
[They finally agreed on something.]

381
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,000
Camping's hot right now.

382
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,290
I don't really like packing
and going places.

383
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,290
And the outdoors...

384
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,630
My mom told me not to do
anything where there's no roof.

385
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,260
I like cooking meat.

386
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,960
I love camping.

387
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,970
I love it, but I've never been.

388
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,000
Are we a team or not?

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,430
You are one team, today.

390
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,750
- We're a team?
- Yes.

391
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,840
I would rather be on the
same team as him.

392
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
[It's annoying if he's on
the opponent team...]

393
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,570
[What is this?]

394
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,570
[A belt?]

395
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,610
There's no way Running Man
would just have normal camping.

396
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,720
What's this?
[What's with this belt?]

397
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,500
What are you doing?

398
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,550
[The staff is putting
a belt on them.]

399
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,060
Maybe you and I are being linked.

400
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,170
Please put the belt on.

401
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,360
Maybe we have to go
everywhere together.

402
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,170
This isn't a parachute, right?

403
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,720
It reminds of the time
I used get training...

404
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,430
[We will fasten you together.]

405
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,700
[What is that?]

406
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,250
- Can't I wash up, first?
- Put it on, then wash up.

407
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,650
But I have to be with him
as he washes up!

408
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,570
[Lock]

409
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,250
[Link, complete.]

410
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,670
[Chain link camping.]

411
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,640
You need to be linked
until the trip's over.

412
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,230
And you cannot unlock it
no matter what situation.

413
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,140
You really want us
to go around like this?

414
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,240
[Shock]

415
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,020
I should have gone with Song Ji Hyo!

416
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,070
What is this?

417
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,040
[The distance is 180 centimeters.]

418
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,310
Don't do that, it's so
depressing between two men!

419
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,420
What are you doing?

420
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,490
Why would you do this?

421
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,750
[Annoyed]

422
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,470
You need to go to
the bathroom together.

423
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,400
There's an exception for your team.

424
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,350
We will only unlock it
for a bathroom break.

425
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,180
- So all the other teams...
- When they change

426
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,090
and the bathroom, too.

427
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,980
No, it's okay.
Don't unlock it.

428
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,420
[All six couples have
become linked by their chains!]

429
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,700
You tie our hands,
and now our hips too?

430
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,660
How are we supposed to go around?

431
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,090
I need to go to the bathroom
because I ate an apple.

432
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,960
[I'm in bigger trouble...]

433
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,900
I'm a little worried.

434
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,760
I just need to use the bathroom.

435
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,030
- My goodness!
- You stay there.

436
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,240
I can see everything
because the door's open.

437
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,070
[This is real variety...]

438
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,010
Come in!
Then what do we do?

439
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,290
You can see everything, just come in!

440
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,980
It already started?

441
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,450
- I need to go!
- It already started?

442
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,060
Just come in already!

443
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,290
- I need to do number two!
- Okay, just come in!

444
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,920
[A link that makes them
share all sorts of things.]

445
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,920
What are we doing!

446
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,170
Just sit down!

447
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,310
What do I do...

448
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,680
Go over there!

449
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,910
If you just unlock it,
I need to use the bathroom.

450
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,880
You can go, linked.

451
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,630
We cannot unlock it,
under any circumstances.

452
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,310
- From now on?
- Yes.

453
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,190
You need to go to
the bathroom together.

454
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,750
For real?
The bathroom as well?

455
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,550
Well, we're guys.
It's okay...

456
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,550
[Awkward]

457
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,430
But I feel a little awkward.

458
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,470
It's very awkward.

459
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
Go and take care of your business.

460
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,670
[What am I doing in front of
a bathroom at this age...]

461
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,650
Do I really have to listen to this?

462
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,980
It's going to be a long day...
A long...

463
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,450
[The sound that I heard just now...]

464
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,210
[Trauma]

465
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,330
He didn't even get ready yet!

466
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,960
[Please let me get ready.]

467
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,850
Please give me the key.

468
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,290
I'm serious, I need to take a shower.

469
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,800
Why do I need to see him take a shower?

470
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,140
Then you turn around.

471
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,720
I need to take a shower.

472
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,020
What is this...

473
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,600
[Help me...]

474
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,500
[Gary went in to take a shower.]

475
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,020
What is this?

476
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,160
This looks weird.

477
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm actually going to shower!

478
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,040
What is this!

479
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,740
[All he can do is laugh...]

480
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,470
I'm actually going to take a shower!

481
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,180
You look like a pervert if
you only have sunglasses on.

482
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,140
He really needs to shower
because he likes to be clean.

483
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,980
He's very clean.

484
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,480
- Do you want to take a shower?
- What is this!

485
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Take your sunglasses off!

486
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,450
[He looks like a gangster.]

487
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,490
He's actually taking a shower.

488
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,460
He also needs to use the bathroom,
do I have to stay?

489
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,730
It's a little far so you'll
have to come in anyway.

490
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,330
[Shock]

491
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,970
We'll have some alone time...

492
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,480
You need to pack items for camping.

493
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,420
You can only take the
items you can carry.

494
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,450
There's not much to bring...

495
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,750
What do you mean?
There's instant noodles!

496
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,320
Let's just go and have instant noodles.

497
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,500
- Yeah, let's do that.
- And maybe like two eggs...

498
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,170
- Eggs?
- We'll add some protein.

499
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,000
Wait, hold on...

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,640
[There's no "hold on"
when we're linked.]

501
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,880
- Four instant noodles.
- Four?

502
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,600
I always keep in mind to take extra
in case I get them stolen.

503
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,680
[They have to be together even when
they're putting their shoes on.]

504
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,220
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong
are packing as well.]

505
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,820
[They're in a tiny space together.]

506
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,730
Wow, what is this?

507
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,020
[A tent and a mat.]

508
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,930
[And even some food!]

509
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,360
I have meat and shiitake mushrooms.

510
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,760
Let's bring this, too.

511
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,440
I think we should bring food
we can eat without heat, too.

512
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,380
[Kkuk begins coaching.]

513
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,910
[He adds some nuts, right away.]

514
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,070
We should bring red pepper paste
no matter what we eat.

515
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,450
- Should we bring this?
- Do we need that?

516
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,690
Who brings a lidded pot
for the outdoors?

517
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,820
They usually bring tin pots.
Yeah, like that.

518
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,690
Yeah, we should bring that.

519
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,050
You should have bought
some plastic containers...

520
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,860
[My ears are going to bleed.]

521
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,060
I'm sorry, but...

522
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,210
[Slightly embarrassed]

523
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,300
You can put the portable pots in there.

524
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,070
I was just going to...

525
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,950
[Ha, ha, ha.]

526
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,040
He's like a mother-in-law.

527
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
[A muscular mother-in-law.]

528
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,690
[I need to be linked with him
for the whole day...]

529
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,890
[At Gary's house.
He's offering Ha Ha ice-cream.]

530
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,900
What is that!

531
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,900
He freezes his compost!

532
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,140
I need to throw it away,
but I didn't get the chance.

533
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,170
[What do we do with him...]

534
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,140
He freezes it so that it doesn't smell.

535
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,300
Kyung Hoon, this is your office...

536
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,310
Can I wrap it around my neck like that?

537
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,110
- What?
- My neck.

538
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,660
He's so picky, this guy!

539
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,010
What is this?

540
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,050
But we can't touch this.

541
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,730
They're not mine...

542
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,360
You can just tell them later!

543
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,470
- Come this way.
- Wait, there's something!

544
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,210
[Drag]

545
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,940
- There's an owner for everything.
- Just tell them afterward!

546
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,800
Our life depends on it!

547
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
- Then we'll just take one.
- He's so timid.

548
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,940
[He's timid and careful.]

549
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
He's really timid.

550
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,820
Let's bring towels just in case.

551
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,810
Just put everything in for now.

552
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,250
[A big load.]

553
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,650
[Struggle]

554
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,090
I was wondering why
you were so close...

555
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,360
It's all for a reason!

556
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Just a little bit more.

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay, we're good.

558
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,540
You should drive...

559
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,700
Okay, I'll drive.

560
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,840
[They need to get in the car.]

561
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,750
[But how do we get in?]

562
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,410
- Okay then, I'll go in from this side.
- Good idea.

563
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,940
[He's so lazy.]

564
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,020
You're so funny!

565
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,960
How do we get in?

566
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,940
You need to get in
from the passenger side.

567
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,650
No, you go in from this side!

568
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,160
I have to go in this way?

569
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,290
You can get in from the passenger side!

570
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,840
No, you can get in this way.

571
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,570
- The handle though.
- I'll drive, so get in from here.

572
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,840
This is so uncomfortable!

573
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,330
[Struggle]
You're stepping on the seats!

574
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,770
I can't get in without stepping on it.

575
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,500
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo are
getting in from the passenger side.]

576
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,860
We need to get in and out...

577
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,710
[This is so uncomfortable.]

578
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,920
We need to get in the car like this?

579
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,210
[Will everything go well today?]

580
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,350
[The six couples are heading
to the grocery store to shop.]

581
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,940
[Kwang Soo and Niel's partners
are Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon!]

582
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,350
[Is it a battle between the older
and newer flower boys?]

583
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,800
[Half delighted, half awkward.
We hope you get along soon!]

584
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,650
They're here?
They are, who is it?

585
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,790
- It's Suk Jin.
- And Jung Chi!

586
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,210
[What is the idea behind
the guests today?]

587
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,180
Are the guests all pitiful?

588
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,950
Is this an anaconda or what?
It's so frustrating!

589
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,380
[Kkuk and Soo Hong give
their shopping mate a present.]

590
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,750
[The fur hat fills his empty forehead.
It's love.]

591
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,110
The fur hat finally found its owner!

592
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,610
- What is the stuff that you keep saying?
- It's that one!

593
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,850
- Is it really that good?
- Yes, it's really good.

594
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,850
[From ramen to pork belly]

595
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,430
Meat, meat, meat!

596
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,330
[Nagging mother-in-law Kkuk
and the daughter-in-law Soo Hong]

597
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,830
[What's the mysterious meal?]

598
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,330
[Don't forget the link
between you and me...]

599
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,740
Buy me a bun with red bean!

600
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,180
Wait... bun with red bean...

601
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,000
[All six teams are ready
for the chain link camping.]

602
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,610
[To the camp site for peak fall color!]

603
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,840
Welcome to the Linked camp site.

604
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,310
[Welcome to the linked camping!]

605
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,190
The guests that are
linked to each of you

606
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,200
appeared to be weak from
the previous activities

607
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,790
on Running Man.

608
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,730
[Are you talking about me?]

609
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,170
You're at the lowest level among the
places you'll be using today now.

610
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,800
There are multiple levels
in this camp site.

611
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,210
We have prepared five trailers.

612
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,650
We put R flags at the trailers.

613
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,080
When you get the flag of a trailer.
You'll be using the trailer.

614
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,580
- You have your bags in the trunk?
- Yes.

615
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,020
You need to carry it by yourselves
and capture the R flag.

616
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,550
We didn't have enough money
to buy plastic bags.

617
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,900
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you said

618
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,700
we're the weakest people...

619
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,830
Stop talking about it, Soo Hong.

620
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,210
He's clingy.

621
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,440
We're going to cook today.

622
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,240
Do you have the tools and fire?

623
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,500
Yes, there's fire.

624
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,340
We brought a grill.

625
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,310
[That's unbelievable...]

626
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,250
We didn't have to bring it.

627
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,890
- That gas grill...
- What did he do so wrong?

628
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,220
Will you stop if I cry?

629
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,390
Do you want me to cry
in front of everyone?

630
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,890
- And say sorry?
- It won't be enough.

631
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,790
It's first come, first serve.

632
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,630
- Start!
- Let's go!

633
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,260
[Let's go!]
Come, Kwang Gyoo!

634
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,670
Trunk, trunk!

635
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,970
Did we put our stuff in the trunk?

636
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,680
Start running!

637
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,000
[Gary and Ha Ha are the first to start.]

638
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,840
[Lightly packed and a plastic bag]
[They're ready to run.]

639
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
It was good that we
bought the plastic bag!

640
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,040
Don't drop anything!
[They'll lose it if they drop anything.]

641
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,280
- Let's go!
- Where are we heading to?

642
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,390
Hurry up, Kwang Gyoo!

643
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,730
My chopsticks!
Jae Suk!

644
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,320
Run, run!
[Jae Suk forces Kwang Gyoo to run.]

645
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,670
Which button should I press
to open the trunk?

646
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,860
Oh, no!
I opened the bonnet!

647
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,100
- Where is it?
- You opened it earlier!

648
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,980
[The other teams are
running at full speed!]

649
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,540
- Hurry up!
- Their luggage is light!

650
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,650
[He dropped a bag of bean sprouts!]

651
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,150
Give us what you dropped!

652
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,000
That's the most important ingredient!

653
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,320
- Jung Chi!
- We don't have a lot of food.

654
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,260
Don't just run.

655
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,730
We need to think about
which zone we want to go.

656
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,730
They have flags.

657
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,980
Kwang Gyoo, hurry up!

658
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,300
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo are the
first ones to enter the camping zone.]

659
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,650
[On top of the hill,
there's a luxurious trailer.]

660
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,940
The one on the hill is the best!

661
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,880
[We're finally here.]

662
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,650
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo
get the best trailer.]

663
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,030
Is that occupied?
Do we have to get down?

664
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,900
[Too bad...]
That one was the biggest.

665
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,900
They got the best one.

666
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,710
[They're entering the trailer
breathing heavily.]

667
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,900
- Isn't this the best?
- It seems like it.

668
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,940
[How does the interior look?]

669
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,150
It's like a hotel room.

670
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,260
[Awesome!]

671
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,480
Wow, it's incredible!

672
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,400
[The living room is decorated
with high quality hardwood.]

673
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,090
[It's spacious and a convenient
kitchen is included.]

674
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,610
[With a fireplace, a romantic
and dreamy trailer.]

675
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,340
- So nice!
- Let's check the upstairs.

676
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,880
It's a bedroom.

677
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:47,150
[There's a sweet and cozy bedroom
at the top of the stairs.]

678
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,570
- Kwang Gyoo!
- There's a shower, too.

679
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,630
[A clean looking white shower space]

680
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,760
It's so nice.

681
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,360
[Let me try the bed, too.]

682
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,670
[They're enjoying the luxury
of an exotic vacation.]

683
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,630
So far, so good!

684
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,460
Just like this, we'll
be able to take a rest.

685
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,630
This happened because we
were moving diligently.

686
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,190
Our plan worked well.

687
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,570
We packed light so we
got the best trailer.

688
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,920
We're having the best day!

689
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,880
[This is heaven.]

690
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,550
[Will it be this happy until the end?]

691
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,000
[At the second best trailer]

692
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,860
[Kwang Soo and Niel enter.]

693
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,940
[This is as nice as
Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo's.]

694
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,940
I think this is nicer than your dorm.

695
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,210
[What are you talking about?]

696
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,280
It's so clean!

697
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,860
- What's that?
- It's a bunk bed.

698
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,780
We wasted so much time.

699
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,340
The other teams have luxurious trailers.

700
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,690
Running Man...
[Maybe we'll get a decent place, too.]

701
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,820
What's this?
No way!

702
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,320
[Empty]
What is this?

703
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,500
Why did we wait in the middle?

704
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:23,170
[Right next to the luxurious trailer,
a very simple tent is waiting for them.]

705
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,980
This is so unfair.

706
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,070
- What do we do?
- What about the grill?

707
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,260
Why did you stop there, Soo Hong?

708
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Didn't you stop?

709
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,630
It's my fault, I admit it,
but I might be upset later.

710
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,530
I have no choice.

711
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,690
Actually, when we were climbing up,
Soo Hong looked so tired.

712
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,400
I thought where we're going
to stay doesn't matter

713
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,110
but he doesn't even realize
I thought about him.

714
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,280
He blamed me for stopping first.

715
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,510
He's nitpicking over that stuff,
I think that's wrong.

716
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,780
I hope he will realize it
as time goes by.

717
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,760
I think I was being lazy.

718
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,590
It's not how an old
brother should behave.

719
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,940
I should have said "let's run,"
but I was lazy because it was heavy.

720
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,340
It's all my fault.
[Satisfied]

721
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,590
I don't think this interview
comes from the bottom of my heart.

722
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,170
It's fine.
Should we build the simple tent?

723
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,760
Yes, it's so easy you can throw it.

724
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,070
Let's not do the hard work.

725
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,960
- What's that?
- It's a pop-up tent.

726
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,130
We're not going to stay over night.

727
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,820
It's already set!

728
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,550
Jae Suk!
Look at this!

729
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,690
We have a house!

730
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,820
Oh, it's not quite done, yet.

731
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,730
That looks so pitiful.

732
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,170
[As long as we're okay,
we don't care.]

733
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,210
They need to clean it later.

734
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,210
Tent is good, too.

735
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,730
But it's better to be in here
in this weather.

736
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,110
- It's done.
- Did you put the mat?

737
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,670
- Put the mat.
- Why aren't you doing it?

738
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,510
You're doing it already.
We can put some blankets on it.

739
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,210
Yes, we have blankets!

740
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,030
[Laugh]

741
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,710
We have sleeping bags!

742
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,780
What could've happened
if we didn't bring it?

743
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,090
We didn't bring it,
but it's all prepared inside.

744
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,440
I'm sorry, but it's between us.

745
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,030
Why do you meddle with us?

746
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,760
Do you want us to rent this space?

747
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,030
No need!

748
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,860
Is that a table?
[That looks good.]

749
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,760
Do you want to use our deck?

750
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,820
Wait a minute, mister!

751
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,780
Your deck...

752
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,840
Can you let us used to space
in front of the deck?

753
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,960
Cold air comes from the ground...

754
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,380
If you don't want your
colleagues to have bell's palsy...

755
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,570
Right here?

756
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,940
Yoo Jae Suk, you're such a nice guy!

757
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,760
[Let's move to our new home!]

758
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,510
Wait, wait!

759
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,010
<i>Your choice is to yield...</i>

760
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,940
[Let's calm down...]

761
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,460
Bell's palsy puts your
mouth on one side.

762
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,920
When it gets that bad,
just turn over to the other side.

763
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,250
Do you want us to look like flounders?

764
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,030
Are you being violent?

765
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,010
Do you want to see what violence is?

766
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,170
We can break things you have!

767
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,380
Let's talk.
If you give us some meat...

768
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,670
- Give you what?
- Some pork belly...

769
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,650
If you give us some meat.

770
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,500
Then, let's share the kitchen, too.

771
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,300
We can have a barbecue together!

772
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,610
Let's share!

773
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,190
If you give us all of your meat,
we'll cook and give some to you.

774
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,610
[The negotiations broke down.]

775
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,780
[This is too much!]

776
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,460
[What negotiations!]

777
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,030
What are you doing?

778
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,460
[While Jong Kook is bickering,
Soo Hong trespasses.]

779
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:20,010
[We need to survive, too!]

780
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,320
Oh, no!
It's my house!

781
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,750
Why is that so weak?

782
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,090
You know how hard it was to buy this?

783
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,320
- That's too weak.
- Pay for it!

784
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,630
My house...
We're going into a sit-in!

785
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,820
Do you want to put it
on top of this deck?

786
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,920
A house on the hill?

787
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,760
This is nice, too.

788
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,110
Then, we'll share the
barbecue grill with you, too.

789
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,630
Please give us some meat.

790
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,400
We'll share the kitchen.

791
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,380
I guess so.

792
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,920
Why can't you say it nicely?

793
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,550
[Getting upset]

794
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,420
[Laugh]

795
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,150
This is 2015, are you still
thinking about using power?

796
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,920
I see, then let's cook some meat here.

797
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,710
- Let's cook the meat.
- We don't need to feel small.

798
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,420
And we'll give some meat.

799
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,010
Start cooking the meat,
we'll be back in a moment.

800
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,800
Start a fire.

801
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,650
It's a bit cold.

802
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,550
We're going to start a fire
so we can cook the meat.

803
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,320
I know, I know.

804
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,500
This is so nice.

805
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,170
Look how comfortable they are.

806
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,130
- Only we're poor.
- This is more fun.

807
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,780
[How will the two families get along?]

808
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,230
[Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon
took a while to open the trunk]

809
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,860
[and enter the camp site last.]
Isn't this nice?

810
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,500
But this is a space for a tent.

811
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,590
[All the linked couples
arrived at the camp site!]

812
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,130
<i>You can unpack your stuff now</i>

813
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,730
<i>they it will be lunch time.</i>

814
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,530
<i>You can cook anything with
the ingredients you brought.</i>

815
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,550
<i>There's a trailer at the back</i>

816
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,170
<i>you'll see a tool zone, if you go there.</i>

817
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,510
<i>You can take anything from the zone.</i>

818
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,510
Okay!

819
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,010
<i>Hope you enjoy your lunch!</i>

820
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,360
Let's go to the tool zone.
We need a pot.

821
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,010
The trailer has a stove.

822
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,400
Make me something delicious, Dong Hun.

823
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,230
Don't worry about it.

824
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,460
It's so frustrating!

825
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,690
We have to go everywhere together.

826
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,030
[His stress goes up.]

827
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,840
Kwang Soo.

828
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,170
- What did you buy?
- The ingredients for fried rice.

829
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,380
Fried rice?

830
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,070
I was going to make stir-fry pork
with bean sprouts but we dropped it.

831
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,800
[He's going to tell everyone...]

832
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,130
I can only laugh.

833
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,760
So, the main ingredients
are pork and bean sprouts

834
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,570
but he dropped bean sprouts.

835
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,510
[Jung Chi feels small
with his partner's diss.]

836
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,710
It was the main ingredient...

837
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,920
I feel so bad...

838
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,030
Bean sprouts!
[I'm still upset!]

839
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,010
[He keeps nagging about
the same thing over and over.]

840
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,170
You dropped bean sprouts!

841
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,050
[Their conflict starts
with bean sprouts.]

842
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,170
You know what the main ingredient was?

843
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,920
Our dish was stir-fry pork
and bean sprouts.

844
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,280
And what did you drop?

845
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,980
You dropped bean sprouts.

846
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,360
Please don't drop anything.

847
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,760
I beg of you!

848
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,000
Actually, it's because of Suk Jin.

849
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,530
I was running fast, but
he couldn't keep up.

850
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:42,460
[So, it's my fault?]
I felt it was too tiring for him.

851
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,130
While I was concerned,
I was tripped and dropped it.

852
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,960
And he kept blaming me on and on.

853
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,230
I hope he doesn't me a long lecture.

854
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,440
It's so frustrating.

855
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,880
We have to stay close for every move.

856
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,820
If you do this while I do that...

857
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,010
how convenient will it be?

858
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,650
[We can't even divide tasks...]

859
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,480
- Maybe they did this way back when.
- Sesame oil?

860
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,730
Because we only have sesame oil.

861
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,820
We don't have vegetable oil.

862
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,190
I think they have it.
I see it, but we're too far.

863
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,940
We both have to walk,
and that's kind of scary.

864
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,670
Let's just go.
We have no choice.

865
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,670
Should we?

866
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,710
If we were smarter,
we could have taken it earlier.

867
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,170
That's vegetable oil?

868
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,280
I think the one at the left corner is.

869
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,010
[They're almost there.]

870
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,070
Please, please, please!

871
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,360
[It's vinegar!]

872
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,860
- Jung Chi!
- No!

873
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,900
It's vinegar!

874
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,090
[You know how we came here.]

875
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,420
I told you it was vinegar!

876
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,570
I thought it was vegetable oil.

877
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,800
I saw it earlier!

878
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,630
It's tiring for me, too.

879
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,150
[The link makes them more
and more uncomfortable.]

880
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,780
Kyung Hoon, we need to spread it first.

881
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,670
Under the link.

882
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,670
It's good now.

883
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,780
Connect it!

884
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,780
[Ji Hyo's slapstick!]

885
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,650
[It's not easy to carry
out a simple task!]

886
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,460
[Starting a fire, so he can't move.]
[Getting something from inside.]

887
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,570
This will expand that much.
Try getting it.

888
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,320
[Struggle]

889
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,210
[Even a simple cooperation
is impossible.]

890
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,210
[Careful, careful]

891
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,880
[Everything gets in the way,
because of the link.]

892
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,300
[In the middle of Gary's interview]

893
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,780
[I'm thirsty.]

894
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,960
Can you cut the link for a moment?

895
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,570
This link?
So uncomfortable!

896
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,320
Why are we doing this?

897
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,360
Gary, let's just make some ramen.
I'm so hungry.

898
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,800
Let's do that.

899
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,500
You need to get inside no matter what.

900
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,900
[I can't even get some air...]

901
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,780
We can cook here.

902
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,320
[As soon as Gary gets inside,
he sits down.]

903
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,530
[Make some ramen...]
I put water and...

904
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,460
<i>Come over here, let's play.</i>

905
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,340
[Glance]

906
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,690
[He's sitting the whole time.]

907
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,400
They even have a ventilation fan.

908
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,090
I really want to cut this link!

909
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,130
If one person prepares
ingredients, it'll be a lot faster.

910
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,840
We can save some time.

911
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,460
How much is it to use this trailer?

912
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,150
It's so nice.
[Will he help me this time?]

913
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,690
[What are you doing, Gary?]

914
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,130
Are you lying down on the bed?

915
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,760
- Are you on the phone?
- No, it's just so nice.

916
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,260
[This is too much!]
Dong Hun...

917
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,940
There's nothing I can do.

918
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,900
- You were on the bed?
- Take some rest, I'll do it.

919
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,170
I was lying on the bed.

920
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,980
He was cheeky.

921
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,440
For example, he was lying
on the bed when I was cooking.

922
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,780
I was working so hard,
he should've cheered up for me.

923
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,320
But he was just lying down.

924
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,440
I hated him at that moment.

925
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,530
[He's making noise.]

926
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,380
[It's your fault!]

927
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,210
[Gary is heading somewhere.]

928
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,730
Dong Hun, why don't you move
to this side for a bit?

929
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,710
I'm cutting right now.
What are you doing?

930
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,980
I need to use the bathroom!

931
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,800
[I can't say no to that...]

932
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,670
Can you make this link a bit longer?

933
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,250
Just do what you need to do!

934
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,630
I can't do anything.

935
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,090
- Where's the flush?
- You need to step on it.

936
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,460
At lease, we need to go
to the bathroom alone.

937
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,170
Why do we need to be tied
when we go to the bathroom?

938
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,210
He's going to have
a constipation because of me.

939
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,730
I'm really sorry, but let
me fart in front of you.

940
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,500
Just do it!

941
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,030
[He farted.]

942
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,510
I was holding it for so long.

943
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,300
I'm okay, but why did you do it on TV?

944
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,980
[He farted in front of the viewers.]

945
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,530
[Let's share everything.
Where are you going?]

946
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,130
[The link between you and me.]
They're coughing!

947
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,030
[One hour passed since
they entered the camp site.]

948
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,800
[Ha Ha and Gary start eating.]

949
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,510
It would've been really good
if we had some rice.

950
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,780
[They finished the noodle in a flash.]
What's that?

951
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,110
Can I try?

952
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,750
- Try the soup.
- Where is the noodle?

953
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,710
It's really good.

954
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,510
Maybe a few noodles are in there.

955
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,360
Isn't this crazy good?

956
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,090
The noodle was really good, too.

957
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,420
- You put peppers, too?
- It's really good!

958
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,090
I can't believe this!

959
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,860
We'll grill some meat now.

960
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,690
Do we need to wash this?
[Will you stop it?]

961
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,110
[He doesn't give him back.]

962
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,210
You're going to finish it?

963
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,840
Don't drink it all!

964
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,510
[He finished the soup.]

965
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,750
You can't stop eating it.

966
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,150
- I ate a lot.
- What's the name of the ramen?

967
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,610
[He acted badly and tried to steal.]

968
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,550
I just need to catch one person,
and you can't run away.

969
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,340
[Thanks to the link]
You stole my ramen.

970
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,880
What are you talking about?

971
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,090
You can be imprisoned for this.

972
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,420
Suk Jin steals it before my eyes.

973
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,690
Are they thieves?

974
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,010
They are thieves.

975
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,130
When one person steals,
the other person should stop him.

976
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,340
But they were praising each other.

977
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:18,150
It's fine, Suk Jin.
I'll distract them next time.

978
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,900
Yes, let's pretend that
we want to see their room.

979
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,690
Ji Hyo!

980
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,900
What are you cooking?

981
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,550
[They're approaching
Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon.]

982
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,820
- We won for the grocery shopping.
- What did you buy?

983
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,360
- Kimchi and meat.
- Meat?

984
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,590
What kind of meat did you buy?

985
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,230
- Pork.
- Pork?

986
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,170
- Where is it?
- It's right here.

987
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,230
It's right here.
[Hide]

988
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,800
[She figured it out.]

989
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,070
- She's hiding it.
- What's wrong with that?

990
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,780
You guys don't trust
each other on Running Man?

991
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,010
You should've marinated it more.

992
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,820
Did I make another mistake already?

993
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,260
We could've eaten the other meat first,
and cook this one.

994
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,630
Then, I'll put it back.

995
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,840
No, don't do that.
Let's just cook it.

996
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,940
It'll be good if you
put it in the middle.

997
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,510
[He fires his nagging bullet
indiscriminately.]

998
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,340
Jong Kook looks like a sergeant
with little time left in the army.

999
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,920
And Soo Hong looks
like a private first class.

1000
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,980
[Do you mean this, sir?]

1001
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,340
I hope he speaks informally.

1002
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,090
He never treated me as
an older person any way.

1003
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,190
I just hope he keeps
his attitude toward me.

1004
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,760
I hope you guy will be happy together.

1005
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,230
That's the end of the
"Bottom of the Heart Interview."

1006
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,570
Are you done?
Was it good?

1007
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,400
Of course, everything went well.

1008
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,010
I warmed the chair for you.
Take a seat.

1009
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,980
Soo Hong, you need to walk that way.

1010
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,710
Think about it, the belt
it connected this way.

1011
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:02,690
I care about him,
that's why I keep telling stuff.

1012
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,510
As time goes by, I think we're
getting along very well.

1013
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,960
He follows me around and listens to me.

1014
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,030
[You know I'm just joking.]

1015
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,230
This is humiliating.

1016
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,710
He's younger than me...

1017
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,980
[I'm not going to cry any longer.]

1018
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,710
[Kwang Soo and Niel are making

1019
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,280
[Fried rice.]
It's almost done.

1020
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,980
- Should I drain the oil and add rice?
- Yes.

1021
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,940
Don't most people fry
vegetables first and add rice?

1022
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,190
Well, if you know so much,
why don't you cook?

1023
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,920
Kwang Soo...

1024
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,960
[Cutting with scissors]

1025
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,630
Do you use scissors when
you cut ingredients?

1026
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,590
Is it important?
Cutting with scissors or knife?

1027
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,800
Not really, Kwang Soo.

1028
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,980
Do you just hate to see everything I do?

1029
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,980
[Being sensitive even
at minor disagreement]

1030
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,110
When he's not happy with something
I do, he complains with wide eyes.

1031
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,510
Other than that,
I'm happy to be his partner.

1032
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,190
He cooks something good and gives me.

1033
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,030
[What's good to be Kwang Soo's partner?]
So far, none...

1034
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,000
[Who do you want to be partnered with?]
I think Jae Suk or...

1035
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,730
[Are you out of your mind?]

1036
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,840
Answer it properly.

1037
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:36,380
Thank you for being my
partner, Kwang Soo.

1038
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,300
Don't we need to cut these?

1039
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,610
Let's just eat now.

1040
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,670
I can't even flip them...

1041
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,320
This isn't right.

1042
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,460
Let's share the food.

1043
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
How does it taste?

1044
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,860
Hey, Jae Suk!

1045
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,380
At least, ask before you eat.

1046
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,360
I'm going to give one to Kwang Gyoo.

1047
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,230
[Now, the trailers owners
are begging for the BBQ.]

1048
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,070
Let us eat the good slices.

1049
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,860
Kwang Gyoo, it's really good.

1050
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,710
You cooked it very well.

1051
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,110
Let's be on good terms.

1052
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,570
- Let's make up.
- We never had any fights.

1053
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,710
It's not like we're living there
because we're poor.

1054
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,820
We never said that.

1055
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,090
[They misunderstood each other
all because of the link..]

1056
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,280
You cooked it so well.

1057
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,130
[Let's eat together, and
forget the bad feelings.]

1058
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,630
Don't cut the meat in advance.

1059
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,460
Yes, cut it when you eat it.

1060
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,440
[Seven hours later,
how do you feel about your partner?]

1061
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,610
We've gone through
the good times and the bad.

1062
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,480
I think we bonded in a way.

1063
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,010
When we first started,
we hated each other.

1064
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,570
Little by little...
as how snow melts....

1065
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,510
I was worried so much at first

1066
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,760
but she's so thoughtful,
she made me feel comfortable.

1067
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,360
I think we'll keep our relationship
in good terms.

1068
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,730
[What will happen to the groups sharing
a destiny who are linked to each other?]

1069
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,530
[Seven hours and a half passed.]

1070
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,840
At least, Soo Hong listens.

1071
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,960
[The members are going
somewhere after lunch.]

1072
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,440
This is extremely rare
for him to praise someone.

1073
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,440
- He listens...
- I feel pity on Soo Hong.

1074
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,360
[He looks more like
Jong Kook's secretary.]

1075
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,110
The fact that he's tied to Jong Kook
makes me feel sympathetic.

1076
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,530
No, I actually feel at home.

1077
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,070
He brings me to take a walk.

1078
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,320
[Where are they heading?]

1079
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,960
It's a foot volleyball court!

1080
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,570
[Welcome to foot volleyball world!]

1081
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,280
[There's a ball waiting
for the members.]

1082
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,030
What is this for?

1083
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,840
This is a sport that I'll be blamed for!

1084
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,530
- I don't want to be on Suk Jin's team.
- We'll lose, if we are.

1085
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,610
[Will they play foot
volleyball with the link?]

1086
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,570
Foot volleyball?

1087
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,840
This is what people always
play when they go on a camping.

1088
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,340
It's foot volleyball.

1089
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,380
It's six versus six
linked foot volleyball.

1090
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,090
The rules are simple but

1091
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,110
if you lose the game

1092
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:12,150
the length of the link will
shrink to 90 centimeters.

1093
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,420
You can't!

1094
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,360
[It's half of what we have!]

1095
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,630
We need to win this no matter what!

1096
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,360
[If it shrinks to 90 centimeters,
they will be really close.]

1097
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,840
[Yoo Jae Suk, Kim Kwang Gyoo, Ha Ha,
Gary, Lee Kwang Soo, Niel]

1098
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,630
[vs. Kim Jong Kook, Park Soo Hong,
Song Ji Hyo, Min Kyung Hoon]

1099
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,630
[Ji Suk Jin, Jo Jung Chi]

1100
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:29,980
Let's kick the ball toward
Jung Chi and Suk Jin.

1101
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,440
They're in yellow.

1102
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,900
We can't lose.

1103
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,070
They're a black tunnel,
not a black hole.

1104
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,110
- We can win this.
- It's impossible to lose.

1105
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,320
- Are you good at foot volleyball?
- Of course!

1106
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,300
I'm good at it.

1107
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,980
He's athletic.

1108
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,530
[Even Brother Kwang Gyoo
seems confident.]

1109
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,420
[On the other hand,
Team Jong Kook is worried.]

1110
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,980
I'll just stand behind Kyung Hoon.

1111
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,320
- Then, I'll stand over here.
- It's so uncomfortable.

1112
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,650
[On top of Big-nosed Brother,
they have Jung Chi and link!]

1113
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,070
Do I look useful?

1114
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,670
[Kyung Hoon's ball technique
doesn't look ordinary.]

1115
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,070
[He's good at trapping the ball, too!]

1116
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,860
I'll just follow around.

1117
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,780
Get ready!

1118
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,110
Good luck!

1119
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,250
Good luck!
Let's win this!

1120
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,260
We'll go crazy if the link
becomes 90 centimeters.

1121
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,320
Good luck!

1122
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,000
[The linked foot volleyball,
first round!]

1123
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,610
Niel, heading!

1124
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,840
[Nice heading, Niel!]

1125
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,900
It hurts!

1126
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,010
[Jae Suk gets the ball and attacks.]

1127
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,130
[Tight]

1128
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,780
[It's too short!]
[Wobble]

1129
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,780
[They couldn't defend
because of the link.]

1130
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,480
[Thanks to Soo Hong,
Team Jae Suk scores first!]

1131
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,920
- I'll do better.
- Don't worry, we can win.

1132
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,320
I'll start!

1133
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,400
[Team Jae Suk vs. Team Jong Kook]
[1:0]

1134
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,730
Receive it!

1135
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,380
That's nice!

1136
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,940
[Kyung Hoon attacks quickly.]

1137
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,980
[But Ha Ha blocks it.]

1138
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,860
[Jong Kook and Kyung Hoon
barely saved the ball.]

1139
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,070
[It's time to attack!]

1140
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,980
[Tight]
[It's too short, again!]

1141
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,880
[Team Jae Suk vs. Team Jong Kook]
[2:0]

1142
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,420
Soo Hong!

1143
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,320
I'm so sorry, but stop talking about me.

1144
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,400
People make mistakes, you know.

1145
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,570
[Cheer up, Soo Hong!]

1146
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,090
Here we go again!

1147
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,510
Run!

1148
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,400
Receive it!

1149
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,940
[Kkuk's heading attack!]

1150
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,750
[Yoo Hyuk's mistake,
Team Jong Kook scores.]

1151
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,110
It was too low.

1152
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,440
We only need two good players...

1153
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,210
[Team Jae Suk vs. Team Jong Kook]
[2:1]

1154
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,280
Niel's good!

1155
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,230
[Niel receives the strong
serve with heading again.]

1156
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,400
[Jae Suk makes another mistake...]

1157
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,230
[Maybe he's not good at it?]

1158
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,170
My team has me, and
their team has Jae Suk.

1159
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,230
[They quickly change positions.]
Niel is good.

1160
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,670
[He seems weak, but he turns out
to be the king of defense.]

1161
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,230
The ball is really hard.

1162
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,940
[Team Jae Suk vs. Team Jong Kook]
[3:2]

1163
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,610
Okay, I'll lower my head here.

1164
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,260
[Niel's high serve!]
It's good!

1165
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,320
[Team Jong Kook returns it easily.]

1166
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,980
Kwang Soo!

1167
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,860
Get it!

1168
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,320
Good, let me!

1169
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,090
[This is a perfect chance!]

1170
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,760
[I'll show you all!]

1171
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,090
Jae Suk!
[He missed the ball big time.]

1172
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,190
Move aside!

1173
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,630
I didn't do anything!

1174
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,670
[Tell me before you move.]

1175
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,880
[Thanks to Jae Suk, we
might win this game!]

[Team Jae Suk vs. Team Jong Kook]
[3:3]

1177
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,610
- Here we go!
- We need to say "mine" clearly.

1178
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,550
[He still looks weak,
but he doesn't let the ball go.]

1179
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,820
[Ha Ha returned the ball.]

1180
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,760
[The foot volleyball expert,
Kyung Hoon's attack!]

1181
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,920
[Kyung Hoon is aiming for the back.]

not hacky sack!]

Here we go!

1186
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,340
What's the score?

1187
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:46,190

and the assistance!]

[Ha Ha's attack was a bit too high.]

1191

[Fall]

[Because of the link,
he can't keep his balance.]

1198
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,150
[This link is so troublesome!]

1199
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:26,500
[They're all in the same situation.]
Why did you fall?

1200
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,440
You fell, so I was dragged, too.

1201
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,800
[Because of the link,
they're in the same boat.]

1202
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,250
If this belt gets shorter,
it'll be awful.

1203

[We must win!]

[The ball is up in the air!
[It's a good chance to smash!]

[The foot volleyball expert
Min Kyung Hoon]

- I'll leave you the back.
- That's what I've been doing.

1215
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,380
We'll do better this time!

1216
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,650
This won't do.

1217
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,440
Take it off!
[Team Jae Suk is heated.]

1218
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,320
We can't lose it!

1219
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,010
[Tight]

1220
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,980
Move a little, Gary.

1221
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,380
Just take it off and throw it.

1222
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:32,590
This drives me nuts!

1223
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:34,530
This links is really uncomfortable.

1224
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:36,590
If you lose, the link
will be shrink to half.

1225
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,860
It means, we have to
go to the bathroom...

1226
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,400
together...
in the same room...

1227
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,000
[The link foot volleyball,
second round!]

1228
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,300
Spread out.
Call "my ball."

1229
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,300
[The game starts with Gary's serve.]

1230
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,570
Mine, mine, mine!

1231
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,820
[He's proving that he's a black hole.]

1232
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,920
We just need to return the ball.

1233
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,110
[Coach Kkuk is trying to give the
black hole a lesson quickly.]

1234
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,530
It was an unfortunate bounce!

1235
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,360
Even if we lose, let's play hard!

1236
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,090
Mine, mine!

1237
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,260
[Suk Jin, move out of the way!]

1238
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,260
[Move away, Suk Jin!]

1239
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,670
When my turn, then?

1240
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,010
[Big-nosed Brother
attacks his own team mate.]

1241
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,650
[Is he on our side?]

1242
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,510
[Nonsense]

1243
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,340
[At this rate, we'll win this game!]

1244
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,320
[They're so excited, they don't
realize the links are tangled.]

1245
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,550
[Chaos]

1246
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,550
Keep up the pace!

1247
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,190
[Confident]
Let's go!

1248
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,190
[Team Jong Kook vs. Team Jae Suk]
[0:2]

1249
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,960
The ball bounces pretty fast.

1250
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,300
Mine, mine, mine!

1251
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,510
[Kkuk pushes the black hole away]

1252
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,960
[and Kyung Hoon returns the ball.]

1253
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,800
We just need to return the ball.

1254
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,780
[Niel's over head kick!]

1255
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,920
[That's awesome!]

1256
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,190
[Kyung Hoon aims for
an empty spot again!]

1257
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,260

[Team Jong Kook vs. Team Jae Suk]
[3:3]

1263
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,730
That's good!

1264
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,280
Move, move, move away!

1265
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,210
[The king of foot
volleyball's power shot!]

1266
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,050
[Everybody, put your hands up!]

1267
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,510
- Gary!
- Slow down!

1268
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:48,590

[Team Jong Kook is leading.]

1272
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,360
I don't want to play it!

1273
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,670
The longer we play,
the more embarrassing it will be.

1274
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,690
It's like he's playing around!

1275
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,030
[What are they doing now?]

1276
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,110
[It's only a serve...]
Let Niel do it!

1277
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,010
Why are you trying to serve, Kwang Soo?

1278
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:19,510
Who told you to serve?
[Hmph!]

1279
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,420
[My poor brother...]

[Set score-2:0]

1285

[One more loss, and it's over...]

1286
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,480
[They're close to the punishment.]

1287
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,110
[And Team Jae Suk
starts counterattack!]

1288
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,920
[His cool face return!]

1289
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,190
[Nice shot!]

1290
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,960
[This is just the beginning!]

1291
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,900
What happened?

[That looked like an air dancer!]

1297
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,110

[He's doing a slapstick
while giving them a score.]

[For the team, Kyung Hoon
doesn't spare himself.]

1309

[He aimed for the middle of their link.]

1318
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,210

[Depressed]

1329

[Why do you always blame
everything on me?]

1330
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,230
Min Kyung Hoon is such a weasel.

1331
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,340
I really hate him.

1332
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,070
Kyung Hoon has good techniques.

1333
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,710
It's the last round!

1334
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:09,420

[Kkuk doesn't let them
score until the end.]

[Team Jong Kook will be
wearing the same belts.]

1348
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,430
You're really good, Kyung Hoon.

1349
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,640
It's going to be really uncomfortable.

1350
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,010
The tail gets shorter.

1351
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,340
[Their link is half as long now.]

1352
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,750
[How will they stand it?]

1353
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:18,220
- Foot volleyball is fun.
- I didn't show my ability.

1354

You had more than enough chances.

1355

It was your best play so far.

1356
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:28,150
[When they return to the camp site.]

1357
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:32,220
- It's a bonfire!
- That's wonderful!

1358
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,860
It's a real bonfire!

1359
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,560
They prepared sweet potatoes,
and white potatoes for us!

1360
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,400
[Pork belly slices, and sausages...
everything is set for a barbecue!]

1361
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,340
Let's have a party!

1362
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,510
[Now we're talking about it!]

1363
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,140
We lost the game, but I feel so good!

1364
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,050
It's so hot!

1365
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,940
It's hot!

tied to each other.]

1367

[Laughing and eating]

1368
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,560
[they're truly enjoying the camping.]

1369
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,800
[To recharge their energy,
they're taking a break.]

1370
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,100
Why don't you go to the bathroom?

1371
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,530
Do you want me to go?

1372
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,360
So, I can go, too.

1373
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,210
- Go to the bathroom.
- Kwang Gyoo...

1374
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,840
[It's even more inconvenient
to have a shorter link.]

1375
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,440
[Ji Hyo, Kyung Hoon, Kwang Soo,
and Niel are having a snack.]

1376
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,310
We should've done this earlier.
I don't understand why we fought.

1377

[Suk Jin and Jung Chi are sleeping.]

[When everyone enjoying
their free time...]

1379

What's going on?

1380
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:01,020
[With the howling sound,
someone punched the trailer.]

1381
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,090
- What was that?
- Is that a ghost?

1382
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,150
Isn't that the sound of a wolf?

1383
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,930
I'm scared.

1384
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,630
I heard howling.

1385
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,150
What's that?

1386
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,800
[Around their trailers]

1387
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,430
- People with animal masks are walking.
- Will the catch us if we step outside?

1388
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,810
[What are these animals doing here?]

1389
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,750
They're walking around.

1390
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,380
Be careful.

1391
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:36,050
Come back inside!

1392
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,890
There's a tiger.
Close the door!

1393
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,960
[A tiger?]

1394
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,930
[Why are you doing this to us?]

1395
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:50,670
[At that moment, a mail box is
put in front of their trailers?]

1396
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,630
There's a mail box.
What is it?

1397
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:56,010
What's this?
Something is in there.

1398
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,810
We have mail.

1399
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,600
That scared me.

1400
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,730
[In the mail box]

1401
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,050
It's the final mission!

1402
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:08,180
Acquire the key to cut the link
and escape the camp site.

1403
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,770
But, there're only five cars.

1404
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:13,520
- There' only five cars.
- Two teams can't escape.

1405
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,650
This is so vague.

1406
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,060
What are these animals doing here?

1407
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,930
Maybe they're here to catch us.

1408
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,690
How are we supposed to get the key?
No clues?

1409
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,220
It seems they're coming toward us.

1410
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,060
They're coming!

1411
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,470
It's scary!

1412
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,530
- Are they after us?
- They were coming toward here.

1413
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:36,070
[They run away in a hurry.]

1414
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,470
We need to stick together!

1415
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,140
They're coming, coming!

1416
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,940
What is it?

1417
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,720
It's so scary!

1418
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,180
Watch out!

1419
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:59,300
[The animals are acting violent.]

1420
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,500
No, no, watch out!

1421
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,390
[They're holding the name tags.]

1422
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:08,180
- Run, run!
- They're not after the name tags.

1423
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,180
They're not trying to rip it off.

1424
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,940
[They're not attacking the name tags,
but moving around them.]

1425
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,850
What is this?

1426
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,310
- Is this a summer special episode?
- My stomach hurts.

1427
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,140
[Wait, now that I look around...]

1428
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,220
- The ones that are walking further.
- Let's catch them.

1429
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,680
[They all have name tags.]

1430
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,350
Maybe we need to
eliminate their name tags.

1431
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,760
[What secret are they carrying
under their name tags?]

1432
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,690
We need to rip their name tags off.

1433
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:36,360
There's got to be something
under their name tags.

1434
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,100
- Are you sure?
- I think so.

1435
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,810
[Then, let's rip it off and see!]
It's a tiger!

1436
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:46,730
It's a tiger!
[Rip!]

1437
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:49,400
[The tiger calmed down.]
There's nothing underneath?

1438
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,610
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry.

1439
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,810
[There's something
about the name tag.]

1440
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,280
Attack the ones that walk alone.

1441
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,960
[The name tag hunting begins.]

1442
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,460
Keep the name tags.

1443
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,560
[Everyone's after the
animals' name tags.]

1444
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,220
Wait!

1445
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,720
Wait, it's better to get
eliminated by us!

1446
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,470
[Rip]

1447
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,140
[They're ripping the animals' tags]

1448
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:17,810
[but is it related to the escape?]

1449
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,900
[I don't know what's going on, but I
won't let you rip their name tags.]

1450
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,690
What is it?
What's with the name tag?

1451
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,850
Rip it, Niel.

1452
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,810
Niel, you must rip it!

1453
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:31,640
[The name tag hunt keeps going on.]

1454
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,220
Look, there're more animals over here.

1455
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,320
- We need to rip their name tags.
- Name tags?

1456
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,000
Aren't they the same
animals from before?

1457
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,600
[The same animals?]

1458
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,770
[Well, actually...]

1459
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,010
[The same animal that was eliminated
is wearing a name tag again?]

1460
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:01,940
[Ah...]

1461
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,050
Maybe we need to rip two of the same.

1462
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,960
Which animal did we rip so far?

1463
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,960
Fox, lion...

1464
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,720
husky, pig, and squirrel.

1465
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:18,750
[At that moment, they
found another husky.]

1466
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,520
[Husky is hiding.]

1467
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,060
[We're not going to let you go.]

1468
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,880
[Rip]

1469
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,640
[Kwang Soo and Niel acquired
two husky's name tags.]

1470
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,380
[Nothing happens...]
What is it?

1471
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,470
Should we go to the car?

1472
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:37,750
Let's go near the car.

1473
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,850
Everyone's thinking the same thing.

1474
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,680
Look, something's wrong.

1475
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,060
[The three teams arrived at the
parking lot at the same time.]

1476
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,810
[There must be a clue over here.]

1477
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,430
Kwang Soo!

1478
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,360
[What's that?]

1479
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:59,140
[At the corner of the parking lot,
he found a mysterious platform.]

1480
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,470
[Run over]

1481
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:06,250
[What is this?]
What could it be, Kwang Soo?

1482
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,110
I guess we need to put
the name tags here.

1483
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:14,920
Let's put any name tags.

1484
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,100
A lion and a pig...

1485
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,350
[Nothing happens.]
Put the same ones.

1486
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:23,150
[It might be the two same name tags?]

1487
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,350
The same ones.

1488
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:27,060
What are they doing?

1489
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,130
What are they doing?

1490
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:31,770
[Stop whatever you're doing!]

1491
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:36,180
[What's going on here?]

1492
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,680
Maybe you need two
of the same name tags.

1493
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,140
I don't know.
Let us try.

1494
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,420
Husky and husky!

1495
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,940
Husky and husky!

1496
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:53,180
[They put the two same
name tags on the platform]

1497
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,800
[and arrows appear!]

1498
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:06,840
[What does this light mean?]

1499
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,670
What's that?

1500
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,380
[Something rises up.]

1501
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:24,640
[They found a key!]

1502
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,020
[We're free from the link!]

1503
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:32,430
[Since the morning, the link was put.]

1504
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,390
[Every time they move]

1505
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:37,770
[it was the most inconvenient
experience ever!]

1506
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,560
[My body feels like it
doesn't belong to me.]

1507
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,630
[I'm sick and tired of the link!]

1508
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:51,070
[It's time to say good-bye!]

1509
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,550
- Are you done?
- I think so.

1510
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,810
[As soon as they open the lock,
they can escape.]

1511
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,060
Did you unlock it?

1512
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,060
Husky and husky?

1513
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,930
Oh, two of the same!

1514
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,350
Let's go, Kwang Soo!

1515
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:10,170
Do we have to pick the
best car or something?

1516
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,430
No, we just need to leave here.

1517
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,210
- Are you leaving?
- Bye, Suk Jin!

1518
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,210
Tell us what it is!

1519
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,060
[We need to hurry up.]

1520
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,710
We're the first place!

1521
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:25,850
- What did I tell you, Niel?
- How was it possible?

1522
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,680
Awesome!
It's unbelievable!

1523
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,480
[Niel and Kwang Soo win the
first place and escape.]

1524
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,630
[Thanks to Niel and Kwang Soo,
the final mission is revealed.]

1525
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,350
[They're targeting the two
same name tags in earnest.]

1526
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:44,600
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong are hunting for a
chicken because they already have one.]

1527
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,800
[Rip]

1528
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,600
Hurry up!

1529
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,430
It's chicken!

1530
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,340
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong
put the two name tags.]

1531
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,190
It worked!

1532
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,880
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong
acquire the key as well.]

1533
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,440
[Finally, I'm released
from this nagging link...]

1534
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,810
[Bye, bye!]
Let's go!

1535
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:12,130
Let's go!

1536
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,060
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong escape second.]

1537
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,690
[There are only three cars left.]
[The rest of them are impatient.]

1538
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,470
[Ha Ha and Gary get two
squirrel's name tags.]

1539
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:21,930
[Turtle, come over here!]

1540
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:26,730
[Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon
get two name tags of Turtle.]

1541
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:27,900
Thank you, Turtle!

1542
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:32,650
[Gary and Ha Ha put
two squirrel's name tags down.]

1543
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,440
[Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon put
two turtle's name tags down.]

1544
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,350
Okay!

1545
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,090
[Gary, Ha Ha, Ji Hyo, and Kyung Hoon
acquired the key.]

1546
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,320
[The dreadful link is lifted.]

1547
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,960
[We're free!]
Let's go!

1548
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,100
[It feels so much better
to be released from the link.]

1549
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,890
I was going crazy.

1550
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:55,190
Let's go!

1551
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:57,470
[Gary and Ha Ha win the
third place and escape.]

1552
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:01,140
Bye, we're leaving!
[Ji Hyo and Kyung Hoon go home, too.]

1553
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,430
I'm going home!

1554
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,600
[I've never been to
such an exhausting camp.]

1555
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,734
[There's only one car left!]

1556
01:21:26,374 --> 01:21:28,884
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo needs
one more name tag of the lamb.]

1557
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,374
Excuse me, wait!

1558
01:21:30,374 --> 01:21:33,014
Wait for us!

1559
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:36,444
We just need to...
Wait, Mister!

1560
01:21:36,444 --> 01:21:38,014
At this rate, we can't escape.

1561
01:21:38,014 --> 01:21:42,154
I'm begging you.
Kwang Gyoo is really tired.

1562
01:21:42,154 --> 01:21:44,984
Please let us escape!

1563
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,394
Save me!

1564
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:49,864
If I was alone, I could've
ripped it right away.

1565
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:53,784
Why do you blame on me?
I'm fast, too.

1566
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:57,804
- Can you do it?
- I can run, count one, two, three.

1567
01:21:57,804 --> 01:22:00,874
[Move!]

1568
01:22:03,744 --> 01:22:06,414
We caught him!

1569
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,714
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo
acquire two names tags.]

1570
01:22:09,714 --> 01:22:12,984
[They can escape if they put
them on the final platform.]

1571
01:22:14,484 --> 01:22:17,584
What?
I dropped it!

1572
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,624
I lost the name tag.

1573
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:21,524
- Where?
- I don't know.

1574
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:25,694
[He lost the name tag?]
[This is driving me crazy.]

1575
01:22:25,694 --> 01:22:28,494
I shouldn't have taken off my jacket.

1576
01:22:29,094 --> 01:22:30,634
Catch him!

1577
01:22:30,634 --> 01:22:33,314
[Suk Jin and Jung Chi
are doing their best.]

1578
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:35,434
Are you not running on purpose? No.

1579
01:22:36,304 --> 01:22:38,374
[I wonder what happened
to Team Jae Suk.]

1580
01:22:38,374 --> 01:22:41,214
Kwang Gyoo ruined it.

1581
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:45,144
[They need to find the name tag
before Suk Jin and Jung Chi get theirs.]

1582
01:22:46,084 --> 01:22:49,614
What do you have?

1583
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:54,314
[It doesn't matter,
Kwang Gyoo will lose it.]

1584
01:22:56,854 --> 01:22:59,164
Where are you going?

1585
01:23:00,494 --> 01:23:02,894
[Found it!]

1586
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:06,004
- I should have picked it up!
- Did you find it?

1587
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:10,174
That name tag!
They must have dropped it.

1588
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:13,804
It was such a drama.

1589
01:23:14,774 --> 01:23:16,614
I thought each of us has to get one.

1590
01:23:16,614 --> 01:23:18,514
My idea was wrong.

1591
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:20,814
Open sesame!

1592
01:23:22,714 --> 01:23:24,714
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo
acquire the key!]

1593
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:29,494
Why do you make me so nervous?

1594
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:31,694
There's only one car left.

1595
01:23:31,694 --> 01:23:35,064
We were supposed to put the
two of the same name tags down.

1596
01:23:36,664 --> 01:23:39,034
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyoo
release the link, too.]

1597
01:23:39,034 --> 01:23:42,734
Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Kwang Gyoo
can escape now.

1598
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:45,274
Bye, Suk Jin.

1599
01:23:45,274 --> 01:23:48,404
[Lastly, Jae Suk and
Kwang Gyoo escaped.]

1600
01:23:49,574 --> 01:23:52,574
- Bye, Suk Jin!
- Good luck!

1601
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:58,454
[Suk Jin and Jung Chi have to clean
up the trailers in perfect order.]

1602
01:23:59,654 --> 01:24:03,384
- The rest of the stuff...
- We need to recycle them.

1603
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:06,524
The first ones who escaped
will be in Seoul by now.

1604
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:10,364
[Clean every nook and cranny.]

1605
01:24:10,364 --> 01:24:14,864
If they released the link,
we could've cleaned easier.

1606
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:17,004
- Same as before.
- It's perfect!

1607
01:24:17,004 --> 01:24:19,374
[All the trailers are cleaned.]

1608
01:24:19,374 --> 01:24:20,904
What time is it?

1609
01:24:23,044 --> 01:24:27,214
Jung Chi, I don't think we have
a good relationship together.

1610
01:24:27,984 --> 01:24:33,414
What a terrible thing to
be linked to each other!

1611
01:24:33,414 --> 01:24:38,024
Jung Chi, I hope we don't
see each other often.

1612
01:24:38,024 --> 01:24:40,554
Should we erase our memory about today?

1613
01:24:41,354 --> 01:24:45,764
[I'm so sorry...]
I can't just say good-bye to you.

1614
01:24:45,764 --> 01:24:47,964
We bonded with each other.

1615
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:51,534
Jung Chi, what a long day!

1616
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,904
It was too long!
