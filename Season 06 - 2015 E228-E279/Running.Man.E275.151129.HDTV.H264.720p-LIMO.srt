00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,801
[The outset of constant
attacking Zerg, Hong Jin Ho]

178
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:01,821
[He's always given his rival Lim Yo Han
first place at every important match.]

179
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,471
[His second place jinx
continued on Running Man.]

180
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:07,760
[Will he be able to
get out of it today?]

181
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,791
[Kkuk and Jae Suk came
to meet the second group of rivals.]

182
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,221
- Who's that?
- Jae Suk's here.

183
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,801
[Huh?]

184
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:22,400
- Hi, Jin Ho.
- Hello.

185
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,360
[Hong Jin Ho and
Lim Yo Han are together?]

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,780
This is the real rival match.

187
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,530
They're actual rivals.

188
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,181
Jin Ho told me that...

189
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:35,051
he's won before,
but he won small games...

190
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:39,181
And he always lost the
big games to Yo Han.

191
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,961
Let's just put an end to this today.

192
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,130
[Lim Yo Han vs. Hong Jin Ho.]

193
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,270
[Lim Jin War,
The story that will never end.]

194
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:51,711
[Their 15 years of rivalry
started with "StarCraft."]

195
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,961
[They will put an end to this
with "StarCraft" today!]

196
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:01,020
[The legendary rivalry,
Lim Yo Han vs. Hong Jin Ho.]

197
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
[Who will be the Big Brother?]

198
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,730
There's a lot of tension.

199
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,821
[The start screen that everyone
recognizes pops up.]

200
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,091
- Can I sit comfortably?
- Yes.

201
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,561
Both of them changed
as soon as it started.

202
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,980
The Emperor of Terran
and forever second place.

203
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,701
He's the Storm Zerg.

204
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,510
To everyone who is
a fan of pro-gaming.

205
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,620
To everyone who loves Hong Ji Ho and
Lim Yo Han, this is an intense moment.

206
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,671
This is nerve-wracking.

207
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,730
[With the countdown]

208
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,110
[the two players go back in time.]

209
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:48,321
[Lim Jin War, start.]

210
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
We aren't professionals, so our
commentaries are insufficient.

211
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
Aside from not being professionals,
Jong Kook has never played this game.

212
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,650
I've tried twice.

213
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,760
We can still... explain.

214
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,850
- The robot is gnawing.
- What are you saying?

215
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,600
He's digging up something.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,331
It's digging resources.
[Lim Yo Hwan controls Terran units.]

217
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,270
Look at them.
Their fingers move so fast!

218
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,380
Even if you don't know the rules,
you can tell that their fingers are fast.

219
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,801
Wow, that's really fast.

220
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,221
You need to mine lots of minerals.

221
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:24,870
You can build a lot of things
with those resources.

222
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,091
When they finish building
their battle station

223
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:31,890
you can attack the opponent's station.
Then, your enemy will be "pwned"!

224
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,530
- Did you just say "pwned"?
- "Pwned", "Pwnage"!

225
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,801
- Don't use that word.
- If you grind them, you win.

226
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:39,451
- So it's a grinding game.
- Yes.

227
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,910
- They're very fast.
- They aren't saying anything.

228
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,221
They are incredible.

229
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,681
[His screen turned off!]

230
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,620
- What happened?
- I pressed the wrong button.

231
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,681
It's been a while.

232
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,721
He makes a lot of small mistakes.

233
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,390
I was surprised that
his screen turned off.

234
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,730
- It started!
- They're at war?

235
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,850
Zerg sent a few troops over.

236
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,291
- Oh, look at that!
- There's a moth looking thing.

237
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,650
Moth... you don't know
anything about the game!

238
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,380
Don't comment,
just bring water or something!

239
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,821
[The moths are moving in perfect order
with Hong Jin Ho's command.]

240
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,780
We're very sorry to everyone
who enjoys this game.

241
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,280
We don't really know
this game too well.

242
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,620
[Hong Jin Ho attacked
Lim Yo Han's camp with moths.]

243
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,910
They're entering his camp.

244
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,110
- That's what's happening?
- Yes.

245
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,311
Terran is also attacking.

246
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,821
- Really?
- Yes.

247
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:46,130
Terran sent his troops.

248
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,051
They're really cute,
they're toddling.

249
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:51,400
Don't say things like that...

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,490
- Why?
- What do you mean toddling?

251
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,910
They are cute.

252
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,581
[Name: Marine]

253
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:02,350
Zerg is sending attacks consistently.

254
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,530
Terran is defending, calmly.

255
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,490
Zerg is blocking.

256
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
He came through.

257
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Terran got in.

258
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,380
[The Emperor's eyes.]

259
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,400
- They're fighting!
- The bugs have joined in.

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,890
There is another kind of bug!

261
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,671
- Just stay quiet.
- A bug with a tail!

262
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,201
- Their attack...
- What's that?

263
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,890
- He turned into an egg!
- Just be quiet!

264
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,780
- What do you mean an egg?
- He turned into one!

265
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,750
He's here!

266
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,780
Terran is here.

267
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,931
- He's attacking.
- Terran brought a spaceship.

268
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,581
They keep sending their troops to battles

269
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,071
[They aren't losing their focus.]

270
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:51,770
This is insane, it's so much fun.

271
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,201
Some things that look like
crabs are flying around.

272
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,250
They're not crabs!

273
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,600
[This time he laughed.]

274
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,471
- They don't even have wings.
- How can you call them crabs?

275
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:05,000
- How can they fly?
- He's here!

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,801
[The match continues.]
Look, it's amazing!

277
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,921
It looks like Zerg is on defense.

278
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,671
There's something
coming out of the eggs.

279
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,600
[Laugh]

280
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,471
[Unbelievable!]

281
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,191
You really don't know anything!

282
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,691
A creature's coming
out of the eggs.

283
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,660
Terran is attacking full-scale.

284
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,900
[Hong Jin Ho surrendered!]

285
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,571
[He seemed calm,
but now he's celebrating.]

286
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,600
[2015 Lim Jin War,
Lim Yo Han's victory.]

287
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,221
Why did you end it
so suddenly, Jin Ho?

288
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:39,980
It's pretty familiar.

289
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,071
I guess you had the
same situation before.

290
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:44,130
It happened a lot before.

291
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,091
So Lim Yo Han will be on
the Big Brother team.

292
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:50,000
And Hong Jin Ho will be on
the Younger Brother team.

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,160
Let's go.

294
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,760
I feel like the day
is already over...

295
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,110
This is a good start to the day!

296
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,791
[Big Brother team - Lim Yo Han.
Younger Brother team - Hong Jin Ho.]

297
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,071
[They're on the way
to meet the third group of rivals.]

298
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,671
[Looks around]
Where are they?

299
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,010
Is Yo Han's car in front or behind?

300
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,691
- He's right there.
- Oh, that?

301
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,730
Wake up...

302
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,780
There's an aftereffect
when I lose a game...

303
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,350
[I have to call
my rival big brother...]

304
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,910
[They arrive at a cozy looking cafe.]
Where are we?

305
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,821
Is it an Audrey Hepburn themed cafe?

306
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,490
They have yummy things.

307
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,061
[The hottest pink girl, EXID's Hani.]

308
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:33,500
[The third rival big match:
Hani vs. Ji Hyo.]

309
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,701
[Rival report]

310
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,870
<i>Does it even make sense?</i>

311
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,671
<i>- How can she sleep over there?
- She's amazing!</i>

312
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:45,341
[The expert of sleeping
and napping, Ji Hyo.]

313
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:50,221
[She changed the paradigm of sleep.]

314
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:54,850
[The Goddess of sleep, Hani.]

315
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,600
[How will their rankings clear up?]

316
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,910
- What is this?
- We were about to start our game.

317
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,471
Younger Brother!

318
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,471
Please move the jackets over there.

319
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:07,691
The younger ones are
supposed to do these things.

320
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:10,620
You need to win, Ji Hyo.

321
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,250
This is just a reverse hierarchy game.

322
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,931
Younger Brother!
Go get a menu.

323
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,421
[Upsetting]

324
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:23,051
Hurry up!
Go with him, why are you sitting?

325
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,890
I think one person can get a menu.

326
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll go get the food later...

327
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Jin Ho gets Yo Han's!

328
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
You get mine!

329
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:34,390
[They have to run errands
as soon as they lose.]

330
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,221
We'll start the match
between Hani and Ji Hyo.

331
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:40,250
What is this?

332
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a pitch-pot game.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,581
Whoever gets it in will win.

334
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,801
Ready, set.

335
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,071
[Ji Hyo goes first.]

336
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,380
[Her first try was so close.]

337
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,270
Don't throw it towards the floor.

338
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,151
What's wrong with you?

339
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,671
- What's wrong with you?
- It keeps going down.

340
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:11,471
Wear comfortable pants.

341
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't throw it towards the floor.

342
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,601
[What is she doing?]

343
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:23,000
Grab the front.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,891
Take care of yourself!

345
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,810
[Throw]

346
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,290
That was better.

347
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,961
Grab where?

348
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:37,820
It's not like he knows
about this game.

349
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,330
The back?
Oh, the front.

350
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,361
This is really hard, right?

351
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,471
[Is it really hard?]

352
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,451
Please throw it more carefully.

353
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:56,310
Carefully.

354
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,510
Throw it carefully.

355
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,671
[I want to try, once more.]

356
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,961
Ready, set.

357
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:02,611
[Kick]

358
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:06,361
No more!

359
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,671
[Upset]

360
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,490
We need to show them who's boss.

361
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,921
He nags so much.

362
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:20,530
Darn it.

363
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,451
[Her remark is like
a middle aged man.]

364
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:28,330
[Song Ji Hyo won.]

365
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,451
Wow!

366
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,240
Why are you guys
happier than Ji Hyo?

367
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,911
Because it's Ji Hyo.
She's a member of Running Man.

368
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,911
Ji Hyo's on the Big Brother team.

369
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,080
[Hani's on the
Younger Brother team.]

370
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,520
[Big Brother team - Song Ji Hyo.
Younger Brother team - Hani.]

371
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,851
[Other rivals are waiting
at SBS in Sangam.]

372
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,760
[Super Junior's leader, Lee Teuk.]
Hello.

373
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,230
I'm so tired.

374
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,800
[Super Junior's Kim Hee Chul.]
Hello, it's been a long time.

375
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,090
[The big match
Lee Teuk vs. Kim Hee Chul.]

376
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,871
There's a Rival Big Match today.

377
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,540
[The two eldest in the group
who lead Super Junior.]

378
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,351
[However, they're very
different people.]

379
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,980
[Hot-blooded Hee Chul vs.]

380
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,851
[serious leader, Lee Teuk.]

381
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:29,090
[They're so different.
What will their rankings be?]

382
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,451
I'd rather be the younger brother

383
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,701
because he holds grudges.

384
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,871
He'll never call me Big Brother.

385
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,050
We're not rivals

386
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,810
but we're so different.

387
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,601
To be honest, we're not rivals...
We just don't click.

388
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:53,580
We're polar opposites.

389
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,871
Even our clothes...
he's so plain and he loves white.

390
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,820
We used to live together
a long time ago.

391
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,651
I love the color red

392
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:06,070
so my side of the room was red.

393
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,401
And his side of the room was white.

394
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:13,181
And to be honest...

395
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,560
it's my first time being
on TV with him.

396
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,490
[It's their first time being on TV
without the other members.]

397
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,911
It's so awkward!

398
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:22,560
Is this "Passing Journal"?

399
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,131
Ten years, and this is the first!

400
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:29,530
[Thankfully,
the other members arrive.]

401
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,980
Hello!

402
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,691
[Noisy Hee Chul.]

403
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,221
[Lee Teuk takes is a step back.]

404
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,580
Hee Chul and I are the same age.

405
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,050
Teuk isn't older?

406
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,111
We're the same age.

407
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,651
Our birthdays are nine days apart.

408
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,131
Oh, really?

409
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:47,250
They're really rivals.

410
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,621
No, we just don't click.

411
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:51,451
What game will they be doing?

412
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,181
I suggested a game.

413
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:58,131
Because we know a lot of people
from various events

414
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:03,070
we can text a female celebrity,
and whoever calls first wins.

415
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,020
- It's simple.
- Single round match!

416
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,871
I was going to text Hani,
but she's here.

417
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:14,270
You have to choose someone
you both are close with.

418
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,490
Yoona?

419
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,631
Yoona.

420
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,060
- Let's go with Yoona.
- Okay, Yoona!

421
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,500
- Ready...
- Press send at the same time.

422
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm very fast at typing.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,471
This is Yoona's number, right?

424
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:31,280
- Yeah.
- It's been a while since you called?

425
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:34,310
Let me just put an emoticon.

426
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,181
[That's not allowed.]

427
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:40,451
You can't use an "item."

428
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:42,851
It's supposed to be sincere.
No emoticons?

429
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,260
One, two, three.

430
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,320
[The text message has been sent.]

431
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,891
We'll wait.

432
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,431
This makes us anticipate.

433
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:54,300
Yoona has to see this...

434
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,901
If she doesn't, there's no point.

435
00:21:55,901 --> 00:22:00,270
Yoona is always on her phone, though.

436
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,540
Hello?

437
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,810
[Hello?]

438
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,411
[Did he get a call already?]

439
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,681
Oh, never mind...

440
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,951
- His random comic sketch.
- We don't click!

441
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,520
[Why?
This is so funny.]

442
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,790
[Just then!]

443
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,990
No way!

444
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,931
Just blur out the number.

445
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:29,631
[He really got a call from Yoona.]

446
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:31,871
Yoona!

447
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:34,971
[Jealous]

448
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:37,540
- She didn't read mine...
- Congratulations, Yoona!

449
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,211
<i>Pardon?</i>

450
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:40,681
Hello?

451
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,840
<i>What is this?</i>

452
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,280
You must have got a text
from Lee Teuk and Hee Chul.

453
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,951
[Upset]

454
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,020
You saw both of them, right?

455
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,621
Between the two...
do you know who I am?

456
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,931
- She knows.
<i>- Who are you?</i>

457
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,701
You have to introduce yourself!

458
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,730
I was in a hurry.

459
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,201
I am Yoo Jae Suk.

460
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:07,340
<i>Hello!</i>

461
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,901
Yoona!

462
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:13,810
You probably got a
text from both people.

463
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,111
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Why did you call Hee Chul first?

464
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:20,351
I love you, Yoona.

465
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:22,250
Please tell us honestly.

466
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,990
<i>I got Hee Chul's text first, so I called.</i>

467
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,361
<i>And then I got Teuk's text.</i>

468
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:33,601
- She's kind.
<i>- I thought "is this for TV?"</i>

469
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,871
So you knew it was for TV,
and you still called Hee Chul first!

470
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:38,800
[Yoona, I'll be good...]

471
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,780
Hello?

472
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,050
<i>Teuk!
You wanted me to call?</i>

473
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,290
She's speaking formally!

474
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,671
Hello, I'm Yoo Jae Suk,
who was listening to your conversation.

475
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,560
Yes, hello.

476
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,580
I only heard a little,
but you don't seem very close.

477
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,050
They don't seem close.

478
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,490
Here, you can talk to Teuk.

479
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,820
Yoona's in big trouble.
Teuk holds grudges.

480
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,290
<i>- Teuk!</i>
- Yes, Yoona.

481
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,000
<i>You're already upset!</i>

482
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:14,171
[Bingo]

483
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,451
[Yoona,who knows he gets mad easily,
is one of Teuk's best friends.]

484
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:18,361
Was I obvious, Yoona?

485
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:21,250
I'll call you later, love you!

486
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,000
[Yoona, thank you and I love you too.]

487
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,361
So Hee Chul's on
the Big Brother team.

488
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:29,580
And Lee Teuk is on the other team.

489
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,780
Jong Kook!

490
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,830
[Big Brother team - Kim Hee Chul.
Younger Brother team - Lee Teuk.]

491
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,530
[Gary and Ha Ha were tired of waiting
and start the mission themselves.]

492
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,330
We can say "follow me" and see
how many kids gather around.

493
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,980
They'll obviously go to you.
You're Haroro.

494
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,020
It's been so long since Haroro.

495
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,471
But these guys were probably
like three back then, so they know.

496
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,401
Please bring glasses.

497
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:57,221
Do you have the
Dragon Ball costume?

498
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:58,980
[Who will the kids pick?]

499
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,451
Let's play tag, I'm going to run away!

500
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:03,250
See if you can catch my butt!

501
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,851
Catch me if you can!

502
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,961
Guys, come here!
It's so fun!

503
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:13,111
I'll give you something yummy.

504
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,980
Let's play choo choo train.

505
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,060
Choo, choo, train.

506
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,250
[The kids are already
in love with Haroro.]

507
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,401
Catch me if you can!

508
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,871
He has a kid at home!

509
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:34,361
Who wants to ride the slide?

510
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:36,530
Let's go!

511
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:42,020
[I'll fail at this rate...
I need a solution...]

512
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,290
Let's go!

513
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,161
I'll buy you
black bean noodles later.

514
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:49,451
[Black bean noodles?]

515
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:52,601
[This is working?]
Two, four, six... I'll order 30 dishes.

516
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:55,911
- Please deliver it to the kindergarten.
- Will 30 be enough?

517
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:59,691
- Black noodles and sweet and sour pork.
- 500 pizza...

518
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,451
I'm going to give them.

519
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:04,181
Children always pick
the last thing they hear.

520
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:06,181
You don't know how it will be
until you open the jar.

521
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,300
Maybe your jar will be opened.
(Pun: you'll be upset.)

522
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,961
I see, I see.

523
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,201
[Easy and composed]

00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:17,221
- Children, come to me!
- Children, come and eat black noodles!

525
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,421
Come to me!

526
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:23,361
[A crowd of children
go toward Mr. Black Noodle.]

527
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,711
In front of Ha Ha,
there are eight children.

528
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,490
In front of Gary, there are 15 children.

529
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,201
[Gary won!]
Yeah!

530
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,310
- Black bean noodles!
- How come?

531
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:43,401
[As he promised to the little angels,
the food was delivered!]

532
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,871
[Thank you so much for
your cooperation.]

533
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,980
Your team members are decided.

534
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,490
There's something you must do,
when the team is decided.

535
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,580
Each of you bow to your own big brother.

536
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,911
Come over here.

537
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,621
He's older than me,
but this is irritating.

538
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:01,290
One by one!

539
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,020
Say "Big Brother" when you bow.

540
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,730
Yes, Big Brother!

541
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,691
Good!

542
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:12,111
- I've never seen this before!
- Take care.

543
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:16,000
It's funny, Jae Suk is older any way,
but he seems so happy.

544
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,560
It's been a while since I've seen
him smiling so brightly.

545
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,421
I'm going to do it quickly.
[It's Jin Ho's turn.]

546
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,691
Do it slowly.

547
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:25,651
Big Brother!

548
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
It seems he doesn't really mind.

549
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,461
It looks natural.

550
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:33,990
Teuk's face turned red!

551
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,730
Teuk must really hate to do that.

552
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:42,000
Big Brother!

553
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Listen to what I say, Brother!

554
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,201
- Jong Kook!
- It's fine!

555
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,681
It's fine.

556
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,451
There's something different
for Gary and Ha Ha.

557
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,750
- They're real rivals.
- What if I had to bow!

558
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,990
There's a war of nerves between them.

559
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,000
Attention, when you bow to elders.

560
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,691
Look!
Gary's so serious.

561
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:09,290
In front of elders, you need to
take off your hat.

562
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,030
[This is upsetting!]

563
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,601
- Call him Big Brother.
- Big Brother!

564
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:19,800
[Yes, my dear brother.]

565
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,471
[All the members are appointed.]

566
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:24,010
It's heartwarming.

567
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,250
[Big Brothers are in red.]
[Younger Brothers are in blue.]

568
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,780
[The real battle begins now!]

[Ranking positions didn't end yet!]

570
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:40,381
[A boiling ranking war
between the rivals!]

571
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,760
[It begins now!]

[All the members are arriving together.]

574
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,310
- What's that?
- I wonder what's that for.

575
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,851
It's huge!

576
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,270
Isn't that a board for the game of yut?

577
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,421
It's game of yut!

578
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:02,381
You're right,
is this a human version?

579
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:03,471
There are yut sticks over here.

580
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:06,381
- We cast them on the stage?
- We need to cast inside the circle?

581
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,070
Big Brothers!

582
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,391
I'm so glad you're still in good shape.

583
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:15,871
- Don't just say it, like you mean it.
- Yes, Big Brother!

584
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,760
- Long life to you.
- You, two, bow.

585
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,131
Yes.
[Stiff]

586
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,800
Younger Brother team
might like this mission.

587
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,911
Maybe it's favorable for us.

588
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:31,270
The winner of this game
will become Big Brother team.

589
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,451
Plus, lunch will be treated
by Younger Brother team.

593
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,151
What game is this?

594
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,760
You're looking at the huge yut board.

595
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,891
It's yut name tag game.

596
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,711
You can play the game of yut.

597
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,330
Maybe we'll be ousted
by name tag elimination.

598
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,381
One player will cast yut.

599
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,020
The rest will be the tokens.

600
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,651
You can play name tag game when
you meet each other on the same station.

601
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,810
Isn't this too disadvantageous for us?

602
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,810
Of course, Jong Kook
will be the first token.

603
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,651
He's the first token!

604
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:18,721
I'll be the token no matter what.

605
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,221
Of course, of course.

606
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,590
Maximum three tokens
can be on the same station.

607
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,961
Then, when we're three,
we can rip Jong Kook's name tag.

608
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:30,290

- It's gae. (2 steps)

- It's geol! (3 steps)
- No, it's gae.

616

Gae means Gary.
Too easy to be chased.

- Then you should just go.

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,420
Why do I have to carry you?

696
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,351
- Anything!
- Yes!

697
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,351
Get do!

698
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:55,690
Cast it higher, Hani!

699
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,791
You're doing a good job.
Just ignore him!

700
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:02,061
- Gae!
- Good job!

701
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,391
Let's combine!

702
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:06,501
- Isn't he ousted?
- No, he can go again.

703
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:08,731
[They already have Kim Jong Kook.]

704
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,900
[Why do they all want to be together?]

705
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,740
He's hurt.

706
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,871
[Big Brother team needs to
run away from Younger Brother team.]

707
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:18,510
- What is it?
- It's gae.

708
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,240
[They run away.]
Get them next time!

709
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,010
Gae!

710
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,181
- Is that yut? (4 steps & extra cast)
- It's geol!

711
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,951
Geol!

712
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,550
[No way...]

713
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,860
Do, gae, geol!
(We can get them!)

714
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,291
[I can't believe it!]

715
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:42,001
[The big brothers are caught by
the scary younger brothers.]

716
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,681
This drives me crazy.

717
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,771
[The worst case possible
actually happened.]

718
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,911
How could we be so unlucky?

719
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,641
[Sorry!]

720
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,081
Why don't you wear your jackets?

721
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:57,581
Why don't we attack Jae Suk together?

722
00:35:57,581 --> 00:36:01,481
You guys attack one of them first.
[They're so confident.]

723
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,291
- We need to stick together!
- Good, good!

724
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,891
- Just grab one of them.
- Don't waste your time!

725
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,021
[Jae Suk is busy protecting
Big-nose and himself.]

726
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,860
They're doing well!

727
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,130
[It's tighter than we thought!]

728
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,300
Hong Jin Ho,
come over here!

729
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,130
[He's planning to get
rid of the weakest.]

730
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,971
Is Hong Jin Ho the queen
who needs protection?

731
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:24,940
Rip it, Jin Ho!

732
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,670
Quickly!
[While Ha Ha is holding Jae Suk]

733
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,951
[Jin Ho's attack succeeded!]

734
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,481
[Rip]

735
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,621
[What a perfect revenge!]

736
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,561
[He must be really happy...]

737
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,161
[Big Brother team goes back to zero.]

738
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,070
Anything is good!

739
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,170
[At that moment, Hani cast mo.]
(five steps and extra cast)

740
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,300
She must be the god of yut!

741
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,771
Cast it one more time!

742
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,411
- We have mo and...
- She's good.

743
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:06,880
Come out, Kwang Soo!

744
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,710
- How many steps?
- Two!

745
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,021
[The tokens can be
combined up to three.]

746
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,351
You can go two steps first.

747
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:15,951
Then, go five more steps for mo.

748
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:18,121
I have to take the longer course.

749
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:19,760
That's better than getting caught.

750
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,931
Let's go!

751
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:24,101
Do, gae, geol...

752
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:25,630
[Trip]

753
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:31,771
[The icon of misfortune...]
Is there any spot that's not flat?

754
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:35,471
- That's too cheesy!
- I'm tired of seeing you fall.

755
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:39,210
I fell for real!
It hurts!

756
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,481
- I'll cast!
- I'm bleeding!

757
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:43,820
I'm sick and tired of it, Kwang Soo!

758
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,121
[What a tough journey
to become an old brother!]

759
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,021
[While all Younger Brother team
members are on the board]

760
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:50,590
[Kwang Soo and Lee Teuk
are close to the finish.]

761
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,231
What is it?
It's geol.

762
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,460
Get in, catch them!

763
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,231
What's going on?
No, they can't.

764
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:03,771
Teuk, you can go out this turn.

765
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,240
Anything's fine!

766
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,971
Reverse do?
[Gae]

767
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:10,440
Finish!

768
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,311
[Lee Teuk finishes it first.]

769
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,110
Mo, do!
Ji Hyo, please get mo and do!

770
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,420
- Mo and do!
- It's not going to be easy.

771
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,791
[Gae, again!]

772
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:25,791
[Slowly, they move two steps.]

773
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:30,661
[Mo that big brothers wish for
are allowed to younger brothers.]

774
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:33,030
[Yut expert Hani]

775
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:36,170
We can't do anything.
We can't beat them.

776
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:39,271
There's no way.

777
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:40,900
[And they even get
the geol that they want.]

778
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,541
Use geol first to take the shortcut

779
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,510
and exit with mo.

780
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,041
We can do that!

781
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,581
Wait, then Kwang Soo
will be left alone.

782
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,420
[They're worried about Kwang Soo
since he's so clumsy.]

783
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,721
You should exit.

784
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,690
You can use mo (5 steps), and exit.

785
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,260
You'll let him use mo?
[He only need one step.]

786
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,990
What are you thinking?

787
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,260
It's mo.
Why would you waste it?

788
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,570
If we can catch Kwang Soo, we might win.

789
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,940
[Big Brother team hopes
Kwang Soo will be left alone.]

790
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,871
To catch Kwang Soo,
they need yut (four steps).

791
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:18,510
So far, Ji Hyo never cast
more than two steps!

792
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,780
Let's get out first.
We'll give you a chance, Kwang Soo!

793
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,681
- We'll exit.
- Time-out!

794
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:27,170
They exited.

795
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,351
[If they can't catch Kwang Soo now,
the game is over.]

796
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:32,021
Ji Hyo, there's only one way.

797
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:35,090
We can only live if you cast yut,
otherwise, it's over.

798
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,561
[Pressure]

799
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:39,460
Unless it's reverse do,
I'll exit next time.

800
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,760
If we get yut, we can attack him.

801
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,800
- Ji Hyo, please throw yut!
- I'll cast now!

802
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,201
Please, please, please!

803
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:50,041
[Yut]

804
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,340
[Wow!]

805
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:57,911
[We caught Kwang Soo!]

806
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:59,871
She just put them down.

807
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,331
Even if you put them down,
it's hard to get yut.

808
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:03,920
Try and see if it happens.
[Demonstration]

809
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,621
See?
You can't get it like that.

810
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,760
[Giraffe is caught one step
away from the finish.]

811
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,960
I'm sorry that we are three,
but Kwang Soo is tall and strong.

812
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,490
- We're in trouble.
- He can do it.

813
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,530
Kwang Soo, it's okay even if you lose.

814
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,900
Why does it only happen to me?

815
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,701
[His first target is Hee Chul.]

816
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:26,210
Good, Kwang Soo!

817
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,911
Great!

818
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:30,380
[Kwang Soo's having a close game
with three opponents.]

819
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,311
- He's good!
- He might win!

820
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,451
Give up, Kwang Soo!

821
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:37,920
[Run[

822
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,920
[He was going to attack Hee Chul,
but he failed.]

823
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,460
Thank you for the hard work,
Younger Brother.

824
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,090
[I should have gotten out
when there was a chance.]

825
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:52,460
[Kwang Soo's third round]

826
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,331
- Nice, it's do!
- You can't change it now!

827
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,201
It's fine.

828
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,440
Mo!

829
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,570
[Thanks to God of Yut, Hani,
they're on the right track.]

830
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,181
One more cast!

831
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:08,010
It'll be perfect if we get gae.

832
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:11,150
Geol!

833
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,391
- You have to go around.
- It could have been short.

834
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:16,420
It's okay, you can go around.

835
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,561
[Again, he's taking the detour.]

836
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,931
Do, gae...

837
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:24,630
If he doesn't get caught here,
it'll be fine.

838
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,900
[Thanks to Hani,
he's advancing pretty fast.]

839
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,800
Maybe getting do is better.

840
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,101
Do!

841
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,740
[They can take the shortcut
and make a turn.]

842
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,681
[Finally, there's a hope
for Big Brother team.]

843
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:43,280
I hope we get yut!

844
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,981
Hani, I need to exit!

845
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,150
It's not that easy to get yut.

846
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,150
- What is it?
- Gae! (two steps)

847
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,920
That's nice!

848
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,121
I'm almost there!

849
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:58,590
- I'm getting nervous.
- This is more exciting than I thought!

850
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,960
Gae is okay.

851
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,771
It's gae.

852
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,501
[It's so close!]

853
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:11,440
[From now on, just one movement
will decide the winner.]

854
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,380
This is so much fun!

855
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,481
- Gae!
- Gae?

856
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:20,650
If they get more than three steps,
Younger Brothers team will win.

857
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,121
If they get two steps,
we will fight each other.

858
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:27,791
Here we go!

859
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,161
Please!
[Don't throw gae!]

860
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:33,331
Gae, gae, gae!

861
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:39,581
[Yut is thrown!]

862
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,621
That's right!

863
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,010
Gae!

864
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,911
[No way, is that real?]

865
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,751
[Is that an infinite loop
name tag game?]

866
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,181
[One more stick is flipped!]

867
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,920
[It's geol!]

- She's incredible.
- We could've won.

big brother, you will be.

They need to quickly pick out
33 cards in order using one hand.

I'm worried...

993
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:28,231
Hee Chul went to a technical
high school, so he's dexterous.

994

Lee Teuk was exercising on
the bar when he entered.

That's just wasted energy.
He might be too tired later.

1038
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:46,061
Lee Teuk made a few mistakes.

1039
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,701
That's where you lose the time.

1040
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:54,971
Playing slower but steadier
can reduce the loss of time.

1041
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:59,271
Hee Chul, rather than being fast,
keep it steady.

1042
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:01,740
This game makes me so nervous.

1043
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,780
Kim Hee Chul is pretty sharp.

1044
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,650
He's setting the cards at an angle
that's comfortable for him.

1045
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:14,121
It's important to set it at an angle,
so it's easier to pick.

1046
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:19,490
- Kim Hee Chul!
- Ready!

1047
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,621
Keep it calm!

1048
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:25,300
- Kim Hee Chul!
- Start!

1049
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,101
He started!

1050
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,670
- He's fast!
- Four, five, six...

1051
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,641
Good, good!
Don't do it too fast!

1052
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:38,050
You never know...

1053
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,650
[Super-focused]

1054
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,251
Slowly, slowly.

1055
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:45,990
[He makes up the mistake he made
in the beginning and speeds up.]

1056
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,891
Great, great!

1057
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:50,460
[Flawless card picking!]

1058
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:55,101
[Using his snaps, he's
advancing at a high speed.]

1059
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,670
Finish!

1060
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:03,771
[He's sure of his victory.]

1061
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:06,510
He's good!
[Bitter]

1062
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,271
He picked the cards so easily!

1063
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,681
[He's still dexterous!]
How can you be so fast?

1064
00:53:10,681 --> 00:53:12,911
Kim Hee Chul's snap was good!

1065
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:17,920
The distance from the card
and his hand was short.

1066
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,121
Right on top of the cards,
using his snaps

1067
00:53:21,121 --> 00:53:23,690
he minimized his motion.

1068
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,661
You didn't move much,
and that's how you won!

1069
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,260
[What will be the result?]

1070
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,561
Lee Teuk's record is

1071
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:34,831
16.95 seconds.

1072
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,971
I think Teuk's record
is less than 10 seconds.

1073
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:38,971
Kim Hee Chul's record is

1074
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:43,780
[Which team will get the point
for the first match?]

1075
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,110
13.24 seconds!

1076
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:51,420
[Kim Hee Chul wins the first round
of Running Man Rival Big Match.]

1077
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:58,190
Hey, little brother!

1078
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,690
[In two seconds of announcing
the result, he acts like a leader.]

1079
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,831
[Welcome, Champion!]

1080
00:54:03,831 --> 00:54:05,931
It's okay.

1081
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:09,201
[We'll win the next match!]

1082
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:11,570
[Let's keep this upturn!]

1083
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,570
As Kim Hee Chul from Younger Brothers
team takes the first victory

1084
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:20,581
Younger Brothers is
leading the match now.

1085
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:25,021
But we shouldn't forget about how
much points they put up for this round.

1086
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,920
More important than
winning is how you use the points.

1087
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,090
If they didn't put a lot
of points for this round...

1088
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:36,231
Through winning the matches,
it's about how many points you'll get.

1089
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,530
You don't know until all the rounds end.

1090
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,360
They need to get ready
for the second round now.

1091
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,601
The second match is Forehead Basket.

1092
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:45,900
Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook
will be playing.

1093
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,840
The first one to score five points

1094
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,271
through the hoop on
the opponent's forehead will win.

1095
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:56,681
Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook
have had death matches numerous times.

1096
00:54:56,681 --> 00:55:00,181
Yoo Jae Suk is the number one
figure on Running Man

1097
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:04,550
and Kim Jong Kook has
an eye on that position.

1098
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,751
[Number One vs. Mr. Capable]

1099
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:08,690
He's raising a tiger.

1100
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:13,431
He's seen the tiger's claws
during the mud battle.

1101
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:17,300
Yoo Jae Suk was smashed into the mud.

1102
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,141
At another match with Kim Jong Kook,
the curve on his bottom was exposed.

1103
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:23,240
It was horrible.

1104
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,641
His position as a national emcee
has been weakening.

1105
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:30,351
Kim Jong Kook who has an
eye for the number one position

1106
00:55:30,351 --> 00:55:35,021
and the national emcee,
Yoo Jae Suk's match for the position.

1107
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:38,291
[I'll put the period on
this tiring relationship!]

1108
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,621
The game of diamond cut diamond!

1109
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:43,460
The confrontation of pride
between two men!

1110
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,391
Jong Kook will do his best.

1111
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,701
[Burning with passion]

1112
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:50,630
Take off your glasses, Jae Suk.

1113
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,900
Both players are ready.

1114
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,670
- Fight!
- Fight!

1115
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,101
Go, Yoo Jae Suk, go!

1116
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,871
The second round, Forehead Basket!

1117
00:55:59,871 --> 00:56:02,541
We'll start now!

1118
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:04,911
[The Rival Big Match,
Forehead Basket, start!]

1119
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,251
- I don't care who starts.
- Go ahead, Jong Kook!

1120
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:11,581
Jong Kook's shooting form
isn't that good.

1121
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,251
[Jong Kook's weak at ball games.]
Arc!

1122
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,831
Arc!
[Goal in!]

1123
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:21,360
Succeeded!

1124
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,960
[Hooray, Tiger!]

1125
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:27,530
Kim Jong Kook!
Kim Jong Kook!

1126
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,900
With score of 1:0,
Kim Jong Kook is leading.

1127
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,561
[What did he just do?]

1128
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,811
[This is feeling better
than scoring a goal!]

1129
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:43,951
Don't be irritated by that!

1130
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:46,251
[Upsetting]
He aimed for it!

1131
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:50,460
He wasn't aiming for a goal,
but he aimed for Tiger.

1132
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,661
This is more of a provoking.

1133
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:56,460
Yoo Jae Suk is taking off
his glasses now.

1134
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,630
He's ready for Tiger's counterattack.

1135
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,400
Just ignore it!

1136
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,070
[Wait and see.]

1137
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:06,300
I feel so good, even though I missed it.

1138
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:08,541
[Will he avenge?
Will he score?]

1139
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:12,010
Good job!

1140
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,311
[Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
psychological warfare!]

1141
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,820
The path of the ball
is getting lower and stronger.

1142
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,121
It's more like a fast ball.

1143
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:25,490
You did it!
[A strong and fast ball!]

1144
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,431
[Good riddance!]

1145
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:32,161
[He forgets about the match,
and keeps making fun of Tiger.]

1146
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,971
He's having fun,
and he will be able to score next.

1147
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,871
- Yoo Jae Suk is smart.
- It's like a jab.

1148
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:43,121
Don't be swayed!

1149
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,840
[I'll remain calm.]

1150
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:48,110
This hoop is in the way.

1151
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,351
[Mr. Capable is focused on the match.]
Throw it hard!

1152
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,581
Aim for the "R" mark.

1153
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,990
[Goal in!]

1154
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,960
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]
[1:1]

1155
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,791
Yoo Jae Suk!
[Grasshopper becomes competitive.]

1156
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:05,760
<i>I'm swayed because of you.</i>
(AOA's song)

1157
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,181
[That was close.]

1158
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:08,860
You just need to
get the hang of it.

1159
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,501
Aim for the "R" mark again.

1160
00:58:13,101 --> 00:58:16,311
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]
[2:1]

1161
00:58:16,311 --> 00:58:17,871
[Praise Yoo Jae Suk!]

1162
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:20,161
Yoo Jae Suk reversed!
It's two to one now!

1163
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:24,110
After he's gotten hit twice,
he's swayed.

1164
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,851
Don't worry, you can reverse!

1165
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:32,351
[Goal in!]

1166
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,690
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]
[2:2]

1167
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:36,161
Please lower your head.

1168
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:37,820
They're rivals.

1169
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:43,981
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]
[3:2]

1170
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:47,510
[Younger Brother team is
one step closer to their goal.]

1171
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,570
Yoo Jae Suk!

1172
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,650
[Tiger is aiming for the hoop.]

1173
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,740
He missed it.

1174
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,960
His mind is weakened!

1175
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,210
Yoo Jae Suk is controlling the game now.

1176
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,561
[Sabotage]

1177
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,820
Yoo Jae Suk!
Goal in!

1178
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,581
[See?]

1179
00:59:08,581 --> 00:59:11,121
[He ignores the opponent's
sabotage easily.]

1180
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:12,831
Four to two!
It's the fourth goal!

1181
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:14,900
It's a match-point for Yoo Jae Suk!

1182
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,501
The game only began, Jong Kook.

1183
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:18,231
The ball will fall from up to bottom.

1184
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:19,971
<i>Up, down, up, up, and down!</i>

1185
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:21,541
He did it!

1186
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,070
He's careful.

1187
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,670
The difference is only one point.

1188
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:27,311
Kim Jong Kook is right
after Yoo Jae Suk.

1189
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,541
[Jae Suk needs one more point!]

1190
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,210
[Please, please, please.]

1191
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,550
You need to finish it now.

1192
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,380
[Nervous]

1193
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,221
Please put your head down.

1194
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:39,920
It's good now.

1195
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,021
[Being sensitive about
the hoop's location.]

1196
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:45,061
He's got the feel of the
angle and the path of the ball.

1197
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:47,760
It's about controlling strength.

1198
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,371
He made it!
[Goal in!]

1199
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,351
The goal went in!
Yoo Jae Suk!

1200
00:59:58,351 --> 01:00:02,740
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]
[5:3]

1201
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:07,851
Since he earned five points first

1202
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:11,751
the winner of the second round
is Younger Brother team.

1203
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,990
They've won twice in a row!

1204
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,291
Kim Hee Chul, and Yoo Jae Suk's victory!

1205
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,590
[Complicated]

1206
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,331
Two consecutive victories
for Younger Brother team!

1207
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:23,030
They have a good flow of the game.

1208
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,900
[Younger Brother team keeps their
upturn with consecutive victories.]

1209
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,170
It was a close game.

1210
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,971
It was really close!

1211
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:33,541
Kim Hee Chul and Yoo Jae Suk's
consecutive victory!

1212
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:34,940
The two players who want
to be the leading figure!

1213
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,110
Of course,
Yoo Jae Suk protected his position.

1214
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,610
We just finished the second round.

1215
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,771
[The Rival Big Match]
[Jae Suk: win. Jong Kook: lose]

1216
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:46,521
[Gary wins over Ha Ha
at the third round.]

1217
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,351
They're feeling urgent
because it's 3:0.

1218
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:49,791
They'll do their best to win this round.

1219
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,391
By the way, if I lose this time.
We might lose at two rounds.

1220
01:00:52,391 --> 01:00:54,460
Our team spirit might go down.

1221
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,490
I wonder how they divided
up their points.

1222
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,630
I think they put a lot
of points on Hani.

1223
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,501
We can win at the three rounds.

1224
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,070
Then it'll be three to three.

1225
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,570
I don't think they put
a lot of points for early rounds.

1226
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,240
They must've put a lot
of points at the end.

1227
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,911
We will win from now on,
no ones knows how it'll be.

1228
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:16,081
Betrayal rock-paper-scissors, a battle
between Ji Suk Jin and Lee Kwang Soo!

1229
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:18,411
It's about who can lie better.

1230
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:22,621
The players will say what
they will throw before.

1231
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:26,121
Will they keep their words or betray?

1232
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:29,331
If they keep their words,
they earn two points.

1233
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:30,960
That's right!

1234
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,161
When they keep the promise,
you get double points.

1235
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,731
The icon of betrayal, Giraffe!

1236
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:43,041
Once, he set up a giant maze
and tricked all the Running Man members.

1237
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,271
Ji Suk Jin, 178 cm and 73 kg.

1238
01:01:45,271 --> 01:01:47,110
With Lee Kwang Soo, Feel! Touch! Cross!

1239
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:50,411
They've been acting together
by using their senses.

1240
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:54,121
The icon of Betrayal, Kwang Soo betrayed
him and they started to fall out.

1241
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:57,621
Ji Suk Jin, by the way,
with the golden key...

1242
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:59,581
He betrayed everyone!

1243
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,960
When I was watching the show on TV,
I knew he would do that.

1244
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,561
Is he showing his true colors?

1245
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:10,331
Currently, Younger Brother team
has won three rounds.

1246
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:13,601
Kwang Soo has to cut the stream now.

1247
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:16,240
You're feeling in a hurry
because you've lost three times.

1248
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:19,240
[So much pressure]
Go for it!

1249
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,141
You can do it, Kwang Soo!

1250
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:22,141
[Big-nose is using the situation.]

1251
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:23,141
Good luck!

1252
01:02:23,141 --> 01:02:27,451
I'll make you go down today!

1253
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:30,021
- Let's go!
- There's nowhere to retreat.

1254
01:02:30,021 --> 01:02:34,221
Younger Brother team has
won three times now...

1255
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:37,260
Kwang Soo has to win
this match no matter what.

1256
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,420
[The one who wants to
fight back to the ropes!]

1257
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,331
[And the one who wants to put a period!]

1258
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,300
[The Rival Big Match]
[Betrayal Rock-paper-scissors, start!]

1259
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,800
Their team spirit is already low!

1260
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,400
What are you going to throw?
[First attack!]

1261
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,440
Don't tell him first!

1262
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,311
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

1263
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:56,641
I'll throw paper.

1264
01:02:57,581 --> 01:03:00,110
- I'll throw scissors.
- Then you'll win.

1265
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,681
I'll throw scissors, seriously.
Please, help me once.

1266
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:05,280
- How?
- Just lose for once.

1267
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,221
Beg on your knees,
he's older than you any way.

1268
01:03:08,221 --> 01:03:10,561
[He doesn't care by fair means or foul!]

1269
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,420
What's the score now?

1270
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,831
He's begging him to throw paper!

1271
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:17,001
You don't know if that's real.

1272
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,701
That might be his trick.

1273
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:20,130
Let's go!

1274
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,471
- I'll throw scissors!
- I see.

1275
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:25,400
Trust each other,
even though we're enemies.

1276
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,800
That looks really nice.
[They make a verbal contract.]

1277
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,621
Get ready!
[They agreed to be true.]

1278
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,911
[Will their agreement come to fruition?]

1279
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,351
Rock-paper-scissors!

1280
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:43,530
As expected!
[They're in a draw.]

1281
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,661
[Their betrayal DNA!]

1282
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:49,070
- It was all lies!
- Right!

1283
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:53,061
At the end of the continuous lies,
if one true statement comes out

1284
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,130
they'll score two points.

1285
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,570
At a critical moment,
they have to be truthful.

1286
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,971
I see how it is.

1287
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:02,471
He knelt, but he was still betrayed.

1288
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,840
They're betrayers after all.

1289
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,280
Both of them are...

1290
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,311
I'll throw paper.

1291
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:11,981
- Paper?
- Yoo, too, throw paper.

1292
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,420
Paper to paper!
[Thinking]

1293
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,990
- Aren't you putting off too much time?
- Scissors!

1294
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,460
He said it as he was throwing rock.

1295
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,320
He did throw rock with his hand.

1296
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,561
[Saying one thing, doing another.]

1297
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,231
Wait a moment.

1298
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,731
- Why are you...
- It's what you did.

1299
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,721
Are you going to throw scissors?
I'll throw paper.

1300
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:33,940
I was going to throw paper.

1301
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,170
Rock-paper-scissors!

1302
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:43,451
[With a truthful statement,
Kwang Soo earns two points.]

1303
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,181
[I've been tricked!]

1304
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:51,891
Lee Kwang Soo earns two points!

1305
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:54,391
Who knew they would both
be truthful this time?

1306
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,090
What an amazing battle of wits!

1307
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,561
It was a skill of God!

1308
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,331
[The Rival Big Match]

1309
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,570
- Just one more step.
- You're on your own.

1310
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,431
It's an important moment.

1311
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:07,800
[Anxious]

1312
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:09,641
[Self-awakening]

1313
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,371
[It hurts!]

1314
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:13,340
Didn't you hit too hard?

1315
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,141
Too bad, he must've been KO'd by that.

1316
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:16,681
[What do you hate me so much?]

1317
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:19,110
Kwang Soo, you're almost there.

1318
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:20,521
Just relax.

1319
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:22,420
Kwang Soo's battle of wits!

1320
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:25,190
Kwang Soo's the one
controlling the game.

1321
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,920
Scissors.

1322
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,190
- Are you going to throw it?
- Yes.

1323
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,190
Suk Jin, I lied.

1324
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,360
I won't throw scissors.

1325
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,630
I say I'll throw scissors,
but I don't do it.

1326
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:43,141
Then, it'll be either rock or paper.

1327
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:46,010
Since you're not going
to throw scissors.

1328
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,240
Then, I won't lose if I throw paper.

1329
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,981
I'll throw paper, then.

1330
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:51,240
He's smart!

1331
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,751
He said scissors
and then he said he lied.

1332
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,681
He's making it more complicated.

1333
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,951
See?
Kwang Soo is controlling the flow.

1334
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,590
He's offensive.

1335
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,021
Ji Suk Jin is agitated now.

1336
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:05,090
Was rock-paper-scissors
this kind of game?

1337
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,161
I didn't really expect much for
the fourth round, but it's so exciting!

1338
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:12,001
[What will these two men choose?]

1339
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,501
Rock-paper-scissors!

1340
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,170
[I've been tricked again!]

1341
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,021
[Lee Kwang Soo wins the
betrayal rock-paper-scissors!]

1342
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:27,760
You did a good job, Suk Jin.

1343
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,001
[With Giraffe's effort,
Big Brother team is revived.]

1344
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:32,871
This is upsetting!

1345
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:34,751
I'm sick and tired of it!

1346
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,320
Don't cry!

1347
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,891
You did such a good job!

1348
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:40,960
Scissors, scissors, scissors!

1349
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,400
- The scissors!
- He only threw scissors, but he won!

1350
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,971
Scissorhands Lee Kwang Soo!

1351
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:53,940
He made a turning point for his team.

1352
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,940
It's their team's first victory.

1353
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,740
He brought their first victory
during the fourth round.

1354
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:03,210
Big Brother team grabs
their first victory

1355
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:06,851
and started chasing their
opponent with the score of 3:1.

1356
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:09,590
They're still in the hunt
to win this battle

1357
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:13,621
if they put a lot of points
for Lee Kwang Soo.

1358
01:07:13,621 --> 01:07:17,530
Is that a bed?
They're bringing in mattresses.

1359
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,800
The mattresses for a sound sleep...

1360
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,630
I debuted 26 years ago

1361
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,400
and I've never thought I'd
cast someone's sleep.

1362
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:28,471
Look at the beds!

1363
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:32,681
We have beds for a Running Man set?

1364
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,880
What kind of game is this?

1365
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,550
For the fifth Big Match

1366
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:43,940
Hani and Song Ji Hyo are getting
ready in the waiting room.

1367
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,121
What are we supposed to do?
[What are these machines?]

1368
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,990
It's not going to vibrate
or anything like that?

1369
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,291
No, it's not.

1370
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,601
They can pretend they're asleep.

1371
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,931
Using medical equipment,
we'll be testing.

1372
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:59,400
The sensor will show their brainwaves.

1373
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,170
It's like a lie detector.

1374
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,471
How can I possibly
fall asleep like this?

1375
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:09,811
They might have bet a lot
of points for this round.

1376
01:08:09,811 --> 01:08:15,650
The viewers of Running Man have seen
Song Ji Hyo sleeping countless times.

1377
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,921
Recently, Hani was sleeping
in the car with a bent neck.

1378
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,820
- Her eyes were rolling.
- In the car, in front of cameras.

1379
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,360
When Yoo Jae Suk was right next to her.

1380
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:31,671
That's why both teams might have
bet a lot of points for this match.

1381
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:33,470
This is a bet of trust.

1382
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:36,341
- We need to bet a lot.
- No, no!

1383
01:08:36,341 --> 01:08:39,470
Hani will be actually sleeping
when they cover her eyes and ears.

1384
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,110
- That's right.
- She's too strong.

1385
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,751
I think they will bet a lot for Ji Hyo.

1386
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,421
There's no reason for us
to bet a lot for this.

1387
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:53,591
- Even if we win, it's okay.
- They'll lose their points.

1388
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:56,761
We need to start whispering, too.

1389
01:08:56,761 --> 01:08:58,791
According to the judgment
of the sleep therapist

1390
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,560
we'll stop when one of them falls
into the second stage of sleeping.

1391
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,400
The goal is the second stage of sleep.

1392
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,940
The fifth round battle begins now!

1393
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,871
We'll start the battle now.

1394
01:09:10,871 --> 01:09:13,310
- Do we lie down?
- Yes, please.

1395
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,041
Feel free and lie down comfortably.

1396
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,150
This is so unfamiliar!

1397
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,621
Song Ji Hyo is on the left,
Hani is on the right.

1398
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:29,291
They have different methods of sleeping.

1399
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:33,030
Song Ji Hyo covers her
face with the blanket.

1400
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:38,331
She didn't use the eye mask.
Covered in a blanket, without a pillow.

1401
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:41,801
Ji Hyo could fall asleep
within three minutes.

1402
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:43,970
She can sleep no matter
how bad the road is.

1403
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:46,240
Can you keep it down?

1404
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:50,161
[Big Brother team is also quiet.]

1405
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:52,640
[Fascinated to see
the brainwave graph]

1406
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,110
[Silent]
Wearing eye masks.

1407
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,921
The graph is showing on the screen now.

1408
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:06,060
If it looks like a straight line,
then it means they're sleeping.

1409
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:12,030
They have different method of sleeping.

1410
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,600
Hani puts her hands on her chest.

1411
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:21,740
On the screen, we can see
the graph for both players.

1412
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,610
Since they're still awake,
the graph keeps moving.

1413
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,240
It'll change later.

1414
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,280
You can only see a blanket on the left.
That's Song Ji Hyo.

1415
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,381
Both of them are known as good sleepers.

1416
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:35,890
They're always feeling tired.

1417
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:39,060
Celebrities usually lack sleep.

1418
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,331
There is much attention towards
the two players who sleep a lot.

1419
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:46,201
Both of them are sensitive now.

1420
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:50,171
They might be sensitive to sound,
or people next to them.

1421
01:10:50,171 --> 01:10:52,940
One of the players seems uncomfortable.

1422
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,690
Of course, this is different from usual.

1423
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,711
Eye masks could give some pressure.

1424
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,140
So, she decided to
take off the eye mask.

1425
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,140
A little light is bearable.

1426
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,480
On the left, it's Song Ji Hyo.
Her graph has more highs and lows.

1427
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:10,121
Hani should open her mouth,
in order to sleep.

1428
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,220
That's still okay.

1429
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,860
Darker...

1430
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,591
At this moment

1431
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:22,070
the sleep therapist says
Hani is closer to sleeping.

1432
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:27,371
If it looks like a straight line,
then it means they're sleeping.

1433
01:11:28,671 --> 01:11:31,541
Song Ji Hyo is moving.

1434
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,110
Maybe she can't get to sleep.

1435
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:37,951
Her graph moves up and down.

1436
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:42,980
On the contrary, Hani's graph
is pretty steady.

1437
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:46,220
It's pretty calm.
Her graph looks almost straight.

1438
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,961
Now, both players' graphs
look almost the same.

1439
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:53,860
Song Ji Hyo is a good sleeper, too.

1440
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,001
Hani's graph seems more
like a straight line.

1441
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:00,070
[Hani fell asleep.]

1442
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:03,701
Hani is getting close to
the second stage of sleep.

1443
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:06,470
Hani is leading.

1444
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:12,911
[Ji Hyo's special skill
has to be applied!]

1445
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:16,081
[Lift]

1446
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,650
Hani wins.

1447
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,291
[Hani wins the match.]

1448
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:26,860
Hani won!

1449
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,360
She's awake!

1450
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,201
[What's going on all of a sudden?]

1451
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:35,440
[Half sleep, half awake]

1452
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,770
Big Brother team earns another point!

1453
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,341
It's three to two now!

1454
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:43,041
They're chasing Younger Brother team.

1455
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,280
Did you sleep well, Hani?

1456
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,011
One of the players is puzzled.

1457
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:49,980
She's not sure if she's still dreaming.

1458
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,220
She's still trying to wake up.

1459
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,650
Ji Hyo fell asleep, too.

1460
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,961
Hani is not fully awake, yet.

1461
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,560
Wow, Hani!

1462
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,390
Ji Hyo usually falls asleep
when she covers her face.

1463
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,430
I saw her opening her mouth slowly.

1464
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,911
It was obvious when she
took off the eye mask.

1465
01:13:07,911 --> 01:13:09,600
- She seemed sleepy.
- She was ready.

1466
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,341
I can't believe Ji Hyo lost at sleeping.

1467
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:13,841
It's nonsense!

1468
01:13:13,841 --> 01:13:16,911
Hani has a puffy face.

1469
01:13:16,911 --> 01:13:18,740
It was less than 10 minutes.

1470
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,751
I didn't want to wake her up.

1471
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:22,511
She was already asleep.

1472
01:13:22,511 --> 01:13:24,121
Good job!

1473
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:27,990
[The dark horse in the world
of sleep wins over Song Ji Hyo!]

1474
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,320
She adds another victory to her team.

1475
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,451
Big Brothers has two wins,
and Younger Brothers has three.

1476
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:37,360
Because we don't know
how they bet their scores

1477
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,301
we can't say one of
the teams are leading.

1478
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:44,871
- Yo Hwan.
- You need to win.

1479
01:13:44,871 --> 01:13:46,581
[Pressure]

1480
01:13:46,581 --> 01:13:49,640
[Big Brothers has hope now.]

1481
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,020
It's all up to Jin Ho now.

1482
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,091
- So much pressure!
- You can do it!

1483
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:57,610
This match is for you!

1484
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:58,921
It's a drama all for you!

1485
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:01,280
If you win this time...

1486
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,650
I think I'm going to cry!

1487
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:07,320
The last round!

1488
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,131
Only one round is left!

1489
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:12,930
Please introduce the players for the
sixth match of The Rival Big Match.

1490
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,570
Today, it's not a StarCraft match,
but a Tetris match.

1491
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,730
Let me introduce two players now.

1492
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,911
Hong Jin Ho and Lim Yo Hwan,
please enter!

1493
01:14:22,911 --> 01:14:24,240
This is the last game.

1494
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:32,921
Hong Jin Ho needs to get rid of
his "number two" tag today.

1495
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:34,621
He could remain as number two.

1496
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:37,121
Good luck, Lim yo Hwan!

1497
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,461
[The relationship
as rivals for 15 years!]

1498
01:14:41,461 --> 01:14:45,461
<i>Lim Yo Hwan wins!</i>

1499
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,871
Their faces are the same as
when they had StarCraft match.

1500
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:55,871
Don't be nervous!

1501
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,240
This isn't going to make you number one.

1502
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,551
I never thought this music
could sound so heroic.

1503
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,020
I think they're betting
a lot on this, too.

1504
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,591
The one who loses this loses the race.

1505
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,890
Get ready!

1506
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:20,030
We'll begin the sixth round now!

1507
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,201
One, two, three!

1508
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:22,831
Good luck, Hong Jin Ho!

1509
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:25,470
Hong Jin Ho is on your right

1510
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,270
and Lim Yo Hwan is on your left.

1511
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:32,070
They need to get rid of
12 lines for this round.

1512
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,841
One by one...

1513
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:37,680
Tetromino is falling.

1514
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,451
Nine lines left.

1515
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,751
[He made a mistake.

1516
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,791
[Nervous]
Five more lines!

1517
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,650
Eight lines for Lim Yo Hwan!

1518
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,520
There is a three line gap.

1519
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,190
Hong Jin Ho has five lines left.

1520
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,761
One more!
And three lines!

1521
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:58,831
Three and six, Hong Jin Ho is leading.

1522
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:02,970
Only two lines for Hong Jin Ho!
One less!

1523
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,801
The last one, finish!

1524
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:08,511
[I defeated Lim Yo Hwan!]

1525
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:10,940
[Hong Jin Ho scores one point.]

1526
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,911
[Bitter]

1527
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:14,911
Stay calm.

1528
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,780
The second round begins now.

1529
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,291
This time, it's 15 lines.

1530
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:24,661
Go, Hong Jin ho, go!

1531
01:16:24,661 --> 01:16:26,860
They're setting the foundation for now.

1532
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:29,091
Lim Yo Hwan is calm.

1533
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:31,600
Obstacles are appearing!

1534
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,400
Lim Yo Hwan is leading now.

1535
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,070
The game looks very good.

1536
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:41,440
[It looks like a high-rise building.]

1537
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,911
[One small mistake can ruin the game.]

1538
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:48,511
[Everyone is nervous.]

1539
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,881
He got rid of two lines.

1540
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:52,051
[Lim Yo Hwan starts playing faster.]

1541
01:16:52,051 --> 01:16:54,890
Eight lines to six lines!

1542
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,421
[Nice!]

1543
01:16:56,421 --> 01:16:58,720
Lim Yo Hwan is doing well this round.

1544
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,860
There's no reverse!

1545
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,791
Five lines to ten lines!

1546
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,301
Lim Yo Hwan only has three lines left!

1547
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:12,671
And two lines now.

1548
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:15,711
Lim Yo Hwan needs to
clear one more line!

1549
01:17:18,961 --> 01:17:23,161
[And the "I" appears!]

1550
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,921
[Lim Yo Hwan wins the second round.]

1551
01:17:27,921 --> 01:17:29,490

[Relaxed]

1553
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,020
The score is one to one.
It's a tie.

1554
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,390
[The third round begins.]

1555
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,730
Jin Ho looks like he's
playing StarCraft.

1556
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:42,201
[The pro-gamer's instinct revives.]

1557
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,970
They need to clear 15 lines.

1558
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,770
Oh, it's a good one.

1559
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:49,770
[What a well-matched contest!]

1560
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,671
One more line is cleared!

1561
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:55,440
Lim Yo Hwan is fast in the beginning.

1562
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,350
Same score again.

1563
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,421
Reverse, tie!

1564
01:18:00,421 --> 01:18:03,990
This is such a close game!

1565
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,591
Current situation for Hong Jin Ho is...

1566
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:14,600
[He put the 'O' in the wrong spot.]

1567
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,060
He made a mistake!

1568
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,701
[You can do it!]

1569
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:19,030
Just one line gap!

1570
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,701
It's too early to give up.

1571
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:23,871
Four more lines for Lim Yo Hwan,
Six lines for Hong Jin Ho.

1572
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,680
[An 'I' appears.]

1573
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,690
[He scored a lot at once!]

1574
01:18:32,551 --> 01:18:33,951
Just one more line!

1575
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,921
[Two 'I's in a row,
he reversed it in a breath.]

1576
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,751
Just one more line for Hong Jin Ho!

1577
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:43,060
[I won again!]

1578
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:48,900
[He defeated Lim Yo Hwan twice!]

1579
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,661
Match-point!

1580
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:52,570
[He can't control his face now.]

1581
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:55,671
[Lim Yo Hwan vs. Hong Jin Ho]
[1:2]

1582
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:57,871
He's really nervous.

1583
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:59,841
He's feeling pressure.

1584
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:02,211
[The fourth round starts.]

1585
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:05,411
[This time, they need to clear 18 lines.]

1586
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,451
18 lines this time.

1587
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:10,820
Lim Yo Hwan needs to stay calm.

1588
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,690
17 to 17.
It's a tie!

1589
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:14,751
Lim Yo Hwan got rid of two lines.

1590
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,461
He's playing it fast.

1591
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:18,661
[He puts 'O' in a pile.]

1592
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:22,261
Slowly, Hong Jin Ho
is waiting for a strike.

1593
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:25,100
Hong Jin Ho!

1594
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,400
[He makes a mistake.]

1595
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,501
[Now is the chance!]

1596
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,140
It's fine.
[One mistake makes it rise high.]

1597
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:35,070
Hong Jin Ho needs an 'I.'

1598
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,541
Not a good situation.

1599
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,541
You got an 'I!'

1600
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,511
[My savior, 'I!']

1601
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,621
Two lines and two lines.

1602
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:49,520
[Jin Ho turns it around.]
It's so close!

1603
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,390
A tie!

1604
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:56,461
[The lines they need to get rid of]

1605
01:19:56,461 --> 01:19:58,930
Lim Yo Hwan, six!

1606
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,501
Hong Jin Ho, five!

1607
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:03,430
The difference is one line!

1608
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,600
Five to four!

1609
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,470
[Super nervous]

1610
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,680
[Neck and neck]

1611
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,140
Four to one!

1612
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,150
It's the last line!

1613
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:19,881
The game ends here!

1614
01:20:23,421 --> 01:20:26,110

[Finally, I defeated him!]

1618
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,240
[Dejected]

1619
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,371
This was a lot more thrilling
than StarCraft.

1620
01:20:45,371 --> 01:20:49,011
More than any finals,
I was most nervous.

1621
01:20:50,081 --> 01:20:52,680
[The only thing that's left
is to check the betting.]

1622
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,390
We'll check the betting
score for the first round.

1623
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,621

1627
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:10,770
50 out of 250?
That's a lot.

1628
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:14,740
They bet 100 points?

1629
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,240
[Big Brother team
lost 100 out of 250.]

1630
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,810
[Because Lee Teuk lost.]

1631
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,280

bet a lot for Ji Hyo, right?

1648
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,930
[Are they making fun of us?]

1649
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,530
I kept saying I'm not confident.

1650

[No one knows who will win.]

1651
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:23,570
