00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,660
[No one knows why.]

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,859
[No one knows where...]

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,859
[He's stuck inside the mystery cube.]

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,170
[Gary is nowhere to be found!]

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,329
[Find Gary, who's trapped
somewhere in Seoul.]

7
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,929
[The only clues are
Gary's testimonies.]

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,870
[As they close in on Gary,
the shocking secret comes to light!]

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,350
["Lost in Seoul"]
[Rescue Gary!]

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,149
[South of Banpo Bridge,
Seocho-gu, Seoul.]

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,310
- Hello!
- Hello!

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,929
It's so cold!

13
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,789
- You dressed warmly!
- It's so cold, Suk Jin.

14
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,079
- You're all here?
- Gary's not here.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,479
- Where's Gary?
- Where is he?

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,659
Today, it's...
[No way!]

17
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,729
[Don't tell me...]
We're starting without Gary?

18
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:55,530
"Finding Gary Race."

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,270
- We have to find Gary again?
- Did he go to Europe again?

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,840
Isn't he at his place?

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,909
He's probably sleeping.

22
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,709
[What happened to Gary?]

23
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:14,620
[An hour ago.]
Hello, everyone!

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,890
It's cold.

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,549
It's so awkward being alone
with this many cameras.

26
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,959
You haven't seen the
members yet, right?

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,359
What are we doing today?

28
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,060
I can't lie to people, you know that!

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,430
What is that?

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,670
[A mysterious box?]

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,310
What is that?

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,739
[A room?]

33
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,109
What's with...
That's prison.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,709
You want me to go inside now?

35
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:49,719
Gary was here an hour ago.

36
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,489
We put him in a cube,
and sent him away somewhere in Seoul.

37
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,120
[You put him in a cube?]

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,040
- Why did you do that?
- Seriously?

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,370
[Yes, he's confined.]
Can you hear me?

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,200
[Gary is locked in
the high-security cube.]

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Then give me some food!
I need to live!

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,400
[He went inside on his own two feet,
and now he's trapped.]

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,639
Can you hear me?

44
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,210
[What on earth is going on?]

45
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,180
Yoo Jae Suk, Ha Ha,
Song Ji Hyo are a team.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,080
Kim Jong Kook, Ji Suk Jin, and
Lee Kwang Soo are a team.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
You need to find Gary.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,419
We just need to find him?

49
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,639
It's simple enough!

50
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,550
What happens if we find him?

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,659
Gary doesn't know this, but...

52
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,620
There's a bed inside the cube.
A bed and a wardrobe.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,750
He'll sleep no matter what,
if there's a bed.

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,199
There are bunch of diamonds
underneath his bed.

55
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,129
[There are diamonds
underneath his bed!]

56
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,909
[Eyes wide open]

57
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,439
He doesn't know about the treasure.

58
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,349
If he finds the diamonds
while searching the cube

59
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,349
then he'll have a chance
of winning on his own.

60
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,770
[He has no idea he has
diamonds under his bed.]

61
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,819
[It's right here.]
They're not good at searching!

62
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,330
[Shake]

63
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,240
[The cube started moving!]

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,349
Please move it slowly, slowly!

65
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,840
[Gary is being moved
without knowing why.]

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,530
What is this...
It's still early!

67
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,680
Hold on, wait!
You should let me see the outside!

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,930
Excuse me!
[Blocked view!]

69
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,000
[Impossible to know the location!]

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,930
[Where is the cube headed?]

71
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,150
Whoever finds the diamonds first wins,
and the race will finish.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
Either the two teams or Gary.

73
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,819
So it's a battle
between the teams, too.

74
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,830
It's not rescuing Gary,
it's just finding the diamonds.

75
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,199
Gary is just near the diamonds.

76
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,460
[Find Gary!
No, find the diamonds!]

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,219
[To Gary, it's just escaping the cube!]

78
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,680
[To the members,
it's finding the diamonds!]

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,770
[The destination is unknown.]

80
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,289
[He finally arrived]

81
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,160
[after a long drive.]

82
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,329
[Nervous]

83
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,699
[Open]

84
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,500
[Where is this place?]

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,810
[Water...]

86
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,439
[Bridge?]

87
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,910
[He can see parts
of his surroundings.]

88
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,319
[Where is this place?]

89
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,459
You have 60 seconds to make a call.

90
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,060
60 seconds?
That's too short!

91
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,629
[Find out as much as you can
about the location.]

92
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,259
[And let the members know.]

93
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,399
Huh?
It's the sound of a train!

94
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,740
What is this...

95
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,009
[There's a train running nearby?]

96
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,680
It's ringing!

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,949
[It's a three way call.]

98
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:14,680
How do you pick it up?

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,050
Did it work?
It is connected?

100
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,350
He's calling us.

101
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,759
- Gary!
- I think it hung up.

102
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,329
I can't work with old men.

103
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,329
What you mean old men?

104
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,910
Have you not tried a three way call?

105
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,370
Jae Suk hung up, too.
[This is so frustrating...]

106
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,550
- Pick up!
- It's ringing!

107
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,199
Hello?

108
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,930
<i>- Gary!
- Hello?</i>

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,839
<i>- Hello, who is it?
- Gary, where are you?</i>

110
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,680
<i>Listen carefully!
I can hear a train.</i>

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,350
You can hear a train?

112
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,329
<i>The sound of a train,
and I see water.</i>

113
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>- Water?
- I can see Han River.</i>

114
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,350
<i>- You can see Han River?
- Yeah, and I'm under a bridge!</i>

115
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,420
<i>- Under a bridge?
- Yes.</i>

116
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,459
- There are at least 10 bridges.
- Dongjak Bridge?

117
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,170
It must be subway!

118
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,500
<i>- I can hear a train!
- I think it's the subway.</i>

119
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,879
- By the riverside...
- A subway?

120
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,240
Do you see any signs?

121
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,009
<i>There aren't any!</i>

122
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,149
<i>- I'm trapped, come quick!
- Give better details!</i>

123
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,000
What's on the other side of the river?

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,220
It hung up...

125
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,819
[60 seconds is over.]
He's bad at explaining things.

126
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,230
[His first call ended quickly.]
Jae Suk!

127
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,089
[Did they find out where he is?]

128
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,100
[The cube will move again
in 60 minutes.]

129
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,420
If you touch a single
strand of Gary's hair

130
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,740
I won't stay still!

131
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,170
[Jae Suk's team is on their way.]

132
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,170
[There are 31 bridges on Han River.]

133
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,009
[The subway passes
near seven of the bridges.]

134
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,480
[They have to get there in 60 minutes.]
I think I know.

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,709
In Dongbuichon-dong, the subway
passes where you can see the river.

136
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,959
[Ha Ha's guess: He can see the Han River
and a train can pass in Dongbuichon.]

137
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,360
I think I know where it is.

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,040
You know, trains can
pass the Cheongdam...

139
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,230
- Cheongdam Bridge?
- Yes, Cheongdam Bridge.

140
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,730
He said he can hear it,
he didn't say he can see it.

141
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,300
He would've said otherwise.

142
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,879
Under Dongjak Bridge...

143
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,569
It's Han River Park.

144
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,680
Oh, you're right!

145
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,879
- That's probably right.
- The parking lot.

146
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,980
Gary!
Gary!

147
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,620
Where is Gary?

148
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,620
- Gary!
- Be quiet!

149
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,459
- Do it alone!
- Go over there and film it!

150
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,259
[Immersed in the act]

151
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,060
Gary!
Could it be that building?

152
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,930
Like that rooftop?

153
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,199
He could be on top of the building!
[He said it's under a bridge...]

154
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,939
[He's playing by himself.]
Not a train, it's subway.

155
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,410
Subway?
Not a train?

156
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,480
Dongjak Bridge has the
railroad for subway.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,550
The subway passes
on Dongho Bridge, too.

158
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,220
It's either Oksu station...

159
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,990
- or Dongjak Bridge, which is closer?
- Oksu station.

160
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,490
- That's closer.
- They're in opposite directions.

161
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,519
We need to go that way to Dongjak...

162
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,629
The enemies have
used their brains well.

163
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,930
Just go do it over there.

164
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,569
[We'll solve the mystery.]
Our enemy is no ordinary man...

165
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,170
You're right.

166
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,810
They will move him again,
if we can't find him.

167
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,269
Yeah, if we don't find him in an hour.

168
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,039
There are train tracks here.

169
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,450
I was talking about here.

170
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,210
Look.

171
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,789
Maybe he thinks a
water reservoir is Han River.

172
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:45,950
Maybe he's in Lake Park!

173
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,750
A park here in Yongsan?

174
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,090
You can hear the subway from here.

175
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,750
[With these circumstances,
they think it's Dongjak Bridge...]

176
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,100
Gary sucks at explaining!

177
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,600
He must've have not seen
the movie, "Taken."

178
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,840
He should have said how
many pigeons he can see, too!

179
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,080
We only have two clues,
we can't find him.

180
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,039
For example, "there's someone jogging."
"There's someone on a bike."

181
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,220
He sucks.

182
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,399
[Jong Kook's team is
heading to Dongho Bridge.]

183
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,769
To put it out there, it doesn't matter
what happens to Gary.

184
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,419
[He's already in betrayal mode.]

185
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,879
It'll be good if we could rescue him,
but we just need to find the diamonds.

186
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,990
While you wait for the members

187
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,620
we will take down part of the wall
stickers, if you succeed the mission.

188
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,480
Then you will be able to see
more of your surroundings.

189
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,799
If you succeed, we will give you
another chance to make a call.

190
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,679
- Are you going to do it?
- Of course!

191
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,860
[It looks like private food in prison.]

192
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,929
[Water bottles and match boxes?]

193
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:53,169
Put the water bottles upside in order,
on top of match boxes.

194
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,659
- Like this?
- Yes.

195
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,549
Challenge!

196
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,169
Are you saying that the
bottles shouldn't collapse?

197
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,679
Does this even work?

198
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,600
Challenge!
[He can try unlimited times.]

199
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,730
[He failed so quickly.]

200
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,269
Even the first bottle fails...
[A bad omen from the beginning...]

201
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,399
I'd better do it quickly.

202
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,009
Challenge!

203
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,480
[He failed again.]

204
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,149
Is this possible?

205
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,389
[It worked.]

206
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,259
Challenge!

207
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,879
[Mr. Random Capable got two in a row.]

208
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,059
[The third bottle didn't make it.]

209
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,059
[While he doesn't know where he is,
he's still doing his mission.]

210
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,129
I look like a crazy man...

211
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,909
[Jae Suk's team is
going to Dongjak Bridge.]

212
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:52,610
[Jong Kook's team is
going to Dongho Bridge.]

213
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,710
[Jong Kook's team arrived
near Dongho Bridge.]

214
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,679
Oksu station is right
in front of this building.

215
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,019
There are trains there.

216
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:03,549
[Oksu station on Seoul Subway Line 3]
Wait, you can see the train here.

217
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:06,419
You can see Han River, and trains.

218
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,789
You can see the River...

219
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:13,639
You can see the River
and hear the train.

220
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,769
- Isn't it here, Suk Jin?
- The train passes the bridge.

221
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,139
Isn't it somewhere under the bridge?

222
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,240
I think so, too.
[Gary is somewhere here?]

223
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,169
- Is there a way to go under the bridge?
- Yeah, there is.

224
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,169
Okay.

225
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,909
Which way?

226
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:31,080
I can't believe I'm so important.

227
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,909
This is really hard.

228
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,649
What about Yanghwa Bridge?

229
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,049
Okay, okay.

230
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:40,220
- Are you annoyed?
- Yes.

231
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,129
I don't why you want to go there
so badly, but I'll go anyway.

232
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:49,029
Or should we really just go
to Dongjak Bridge?

233
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,399
Dongjak Bridge...

234
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,899
I don't think so, it's too close!

235
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,340
- I'm not feeling it.
- Let's go there first.

236
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,600
Alright, I'll go to Dongjak Bridge.

237
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,779
- I swear it's Yonghwa Bridge...
- Ji Hyo asked to go to Dongjak Bridge.

238
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,039
Let's hear Ji Hyo out first.

239
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,309
Jae Suk, we started on Banpo Bridge.
Do you think they put him so close?

240
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,820
You're not two passengers sharing a cab!

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,019
Think about it.
It's too close!

242
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,789
Well, we can drop by
since it's on the way.

243
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:17,789
This is the last chance to
enter Gangbyeon Expressway!

244
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,559
[The time is passing,
but they don't know where Gary is...]

245
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,169
Gary should have given
the tiny details, too!

246
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:29,840
[What is Gary doing at this time?]
I'm going mad.

247
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,509
[He's still struggling.]

248
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,659
[Why doesn't this work...]
[It's not something really difficult.]

249
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,419
I'm so angry!

250
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,950
It's been a long time since
I was so stressed out.

251
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,220
[He needs to get the hint.]

252
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,950
I need to do it in one try!

253
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,570
[Focused]

254
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,230
[Please, work...]

255
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,929
Okay!

256
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,440
[He did three bottles!]

257
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,269
[There is hope.]

258
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,399
Okay!

259
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,379
[There's only one bottle left!]

260
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,320
[He got it in one try!]

261
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,129
[He succeeded with all five bottles.]

262
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:28,769
I should have used my left hand!

263
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,399
Maybe I was a lefty.

264
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,629
[He got black bean noodles too
thanks to his left hand.]

265
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,440
Thank you very much.

266
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,769
[What?]

267
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,840
[He lifted the blankets!]

268
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,710
<i>Gary doesn't know this but...</i>

269
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,080
<i>There are diamonds
underneath his bed.</i>

270
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,090
<i>Gary doesn't know about it.</i>

271
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,789
<i>If Gary finds it first</i>

272
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,529
<i>then he gets to keep it.</i>

273
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,509
[Gary didn't know
about the diamonds.]

274
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,710
[Did he find out while he was
trying to eat black bean noodles?]

275
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,529
[But just then!]

276
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,039
[They removed a wall
sticker from the wall!]

277
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,889
[There's a number?]

278
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,320
[Stare]

279
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,019
This is under my building!

280
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,620
This is Ttukseom Resort Station!

281
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,840
[He got a huge hint
through the tiny hole.]

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,129
[It's a view that he's familiar with.]
I know where I am.

283
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,110
It is Ttukseom Resort Station.

284
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,710
I don't have to get out now,
can I eat the noodle first?

285
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,750
I haven't eaten a bite yet.

286
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,309
They can't unlock it
even if they get here.

287
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,000
Most likely, I'll solve
the problem on my own.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,860
[North of Cheondam Bridge]

289
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,769
We got a call from Gary!

290
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,529
Where are you?
[Gary called after the mission.]

291
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,970
<i>Dong Hun!</i>

292
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,000
Calm down.
[He's more hyper than Gary.]

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,240
<i>Jae Suk, I know for sure.</i>

294
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,970
<i>I'm under Ttukseom Resort Station.</i>

295
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,740
<i>- Ttukseom?
- Ttukseom Resort Station!</i>

296
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,950
Not Ttukseom Station,
Ttukseom Resort Station.

297
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,710
Ttukseom Resort Station?

298
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,509
Gary, Gary!
[He calls Jong Kook's team, too.]

299
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:35,820
<i>I'm at Ttukseom Resort Station!</i>

300
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,220
I know where it is.

301
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,440
We'll come quickly!
I won't let them hurt you!

302
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,590
Take Gangbyeon Expressway.

303
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,460
And go through Han River Park.

304
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,799
We just need to stay on
Gangbyeon Expressway.

305
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,039
[Jong Kook's team is closer!]
Go straight.

306
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,480
We need to take Yeongdong Bridge road.

307
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,200
It's really close from here.

308
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,019
Ttukseom is where we rode bikes.

309
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,679
Take Seongsu Bridge,
and take the Olympic road.

310
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,279
[They just need to take
Gangbyeon Expressway.]

311
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,200
[Why are they going on the wrong way?]
I'm like a navigator, right?

312
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm such a great assistant!

313
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,120
[Tactless Big-nose and Kkuk
who has no sense of direction]

314
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,639
[Together, they've
made a big mistake...]

315
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,360
<i>Recalculating route.</i>

316
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,080
We're going the wrong way!

317
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,929
[He figured it out too late.]

318
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,799
Oh my god...
He's not helping at all.

319
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,929
There's not so much difference.

320
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,679
You have to travel
twice the distance.

321
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,820
- We'll get there soon.
- We have to come back.

322
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,039
Yes, but it'll be quick.

323
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,279
[He's trying to be calm.]
Right, this way.

324
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,529
[Jae Suk's team is heading
to Ttukseom without a problem.]

325
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,950
There's an entrance to the
Ttukseom Resort Station.

326
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,750
It's under here, right?

327
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,840
[She's giving detailed information.]

328
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,929
[Navigator Blank is providing
even the tiniest details.]

329
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,639
- This way?
- Yes.

330
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,480
Oh, there's an entrance.

331
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,150
- It's here?
- Yes.

332
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,400
That's expected of Song Ji Hyo.
You came here for a date?

333
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,460
[Found guilty!]

334
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,279
- A jimmy jib over there!
- What is it?

335
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,220
- There's a camera crane!
- Where?

336
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,750
[It's right there!]

337
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,950
[They arrived to
Ttukseom Resort Station.]

338
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,440
[They got a call from Jong Kook's team!]

339
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,799
Suseo?
Why are you going there?

340
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,480
You went the wrong way?

341
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,390
12 kilometers?
The navigation is wrong!

342
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,599
Wow, this happens.

343
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,349
I can't believe this happened.

344
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:39,400
[How is it possible?]

345
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm laughing

346
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,170
because we could have
entered Yeongdong Bridge.

347
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,769
We could have gotten there already.

348
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,569
It was four kilometers before,
now we have to travel 12.

349
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,380
[Will they be able to see Gary today?]

350
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,950
They're heading to Suseo?

351
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,619
- He's right there!
- Where?

352
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,910
- Gary!
- Dong Hun!

353
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,619
[Jae Suk's first encounter
with the cube.]

354
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,039
There are so many things around here.
Why did you explain it like that?

355
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,240
[There are diamonds inside?]
I didn't have enough time.

356
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,710
- Does it have to be you?
- I know, it's always Gary.

357
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,059
They ordered black bean noodles
for me though.

358
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,480
I ate the noodle at least.
It was so good.

359
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,250
[He's so simple.]
Looking at the river while eating...

360
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,910
[That's that...]

361
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,059
[But have you found the
diamonds underneath your bed?]

362
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,279
Please let me out.

363
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,200
[What's the mission
that can get Gary out?]

364
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,599
There's 14 minutes left.

365
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,200
In the meantime, do you see that?

366
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,130
Stand beside it and shout
"watch out for colds!"

367
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,460
[And you have to catch the
snot in ten seconds.]

368
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,170
You can have as many key cards
as the number of catches.

369
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,019
- Really?
- Yes, hurry since there's not much time.

370
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,730
We have to catch it, right?

371
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,049
Okay, ready.

372
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,710
Watch out for colds!

373
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,839
This doesn't work!

374
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,480
You're not doing it on purpose, right?

375
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,799
We're trying to rescue you!

376
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,769
Ji Hyo, I only have you.

377
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:27,259
Watch out for colds!

378
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:32,970
[Really?
You're sniveling this fast?]

379
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,420
You can't catch it?

380
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,769
This is frustrating!

381
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,170
It doesn't work...

382
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,049
Watch out for colds!

383
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,710
[He has to catch it when it moves.]

384
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,660
[It's not easy.]
How do we catch that!

385
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,839
- You really can't catch it?
- It's too fast.

386
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,000
Watch out for colds!
[Now, they can use both hands.]

387
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,470
[The screen is not paused.]

388
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,140
[Playing hard to get]

389
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,549
This is driving me crazy.

390
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,880
I really want to try it!

391
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,319
Watch out for colds!

392
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,859
I caught it!

393
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,490
You caught it?

394
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,309
[Their first success.]

395
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,960
Am I going out?

396
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,529
There are more than one key?

397
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,839
I caught it!

398
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,109
Song Ji Hyo!

399
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,940
That's amazing!

400
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,079
- She's good.
- I caught it.

401
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,750
Watch out for colds.

402
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,220
He's so determined.

403
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,019
He is determined.

404
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,690
[He has malice.]

405
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,059
[They only have one try left!]
There are two at the back.

406
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,559
Watch out for colds!

407
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,599
[Success]

408
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,230
We did it!

409
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,940
Awesome!
[They got three keys in total.]

410
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,269
We can at least do this
because we got here early.

411
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,680
Suk Jin's team won't
be able to see Gary.

412
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,750
[Jong Kook's team
is lost on the highway.]

413
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,619
We came all the way to Suseo.

414
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:27,549
[We just took Seongsu Bridge,
how did this happen?]

415
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:29,750
When we come to our minds,
we're in Suseo.

416
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,859
[Laugh]

417
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,619
Let's laugh it off.

418
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,970
[Do they laugh when
they're too stressed?]

419
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,099
[Finally, they' having the
opportunity to open the cube!]

420
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,509
How many keys do you see?

421
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,769
There are too many!
[They can pick 3 out of 30.]

422
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,009
This is insane!

423
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,380
- Pick one, Ji Hyo.
- You should pick, Ji Hyo!

424
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,849
[Each of them will pick one.]

425
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,349
[Did they pick the right key?]

426
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,319
Please open it for me.

427
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,109
[The race will be over if the door opens,
and they find the treasure box.]

428
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,880
[Please, please, please...]

429
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,970
[Failed]

430
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,799
- It didn't open?
- No.

431
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,349
It doesn't work?

432
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:25,150
[The second trial]

433
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,930
Both of them are wrong.

434
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,279
[It's Ha Ha's turn.]

435
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,369
Gary, good luck!

436
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,130
- You're the last hope!
- Open it!

437
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,730
- Here we go!
- Let's go!

438
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,890
I want to go out and play!

439
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,190
I want to save you, too!
[We want the diamonds!]

440
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,700
[Will it open?]

441
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,039
[Failed]

442
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,140
[60 minutes have passed,
the cube will be moved!]

443
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,279
Order another bowl of noodles!

444
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,619
Gary, tell us everything you see.

445
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,150
You should tell us
every single thing you see.

446
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,509
The location of the bridge,
something like that.

447
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,059
- You can see Han River very close.
- You can see the trade center from here.

448
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,200
Look at this, Jae Suk.

449
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,349
They block my view like this.

450
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:22,730
We'll rescue you, don't worry!
[We'll rescue the diamonds!]

451
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,670
- Ji Hyo, I'm counting on you!
- Wait a little, we'll be there soon!

452
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,079
Please!
[The cube is moving.]

453
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,549
[Help me!]

454
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,009
What are they doing?

455
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,710
Gary is almost 40 years old.

456
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,079
[A 40-year-old man is riding something
that other people push for him.]

457
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,250
What are we doing?

458
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,920
[Bizarre scene]

459
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,730
Seeing them makes me want to get out.

460
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,430
[His lonely battle continues.]

461
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,440
He's over there.
Right over there!

462
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,410
- There's a large box.
- Where?

463
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,779
[Jong Kook's team arrives on time.]
We found him!

464
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:11,109
[Right before they put
the cube on the truck.]

465
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,779
- Yes?
- Gary!

466
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,549
[They found the cube,
before the cube was gone.]

467
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,750
- Gary!
- Yes!

468
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,990
- Where are you?
- Please, rescue me!

469
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,759
[He was trapped in this kind of box?]

470
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,990
Get up!

471
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,960
- Gary!
- He's over here.

472
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,069
Who are you?
What have you done?

473
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:33,900
Kwang Soo, film that alone.

474
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,359
Come to the car when you're done.

475
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,859
Gary!

476
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,509
Gary!
No!

477
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:45,640
Gary!

[Actor Lee Kwang Soo is
burning his heart for acting.]

479

Suk Jin!

480
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,240
Why did you go all the way to Suseo?

481
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,460
It was the navigator.

482
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,710
Don't make us
look like a foolish team.

483
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,599
Think about it.

484
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,730
It's two to one.

485
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,569
What's two to one?

486
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,440
[Two fools vs. one ordinary man]

487
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,539
What are the two?

488
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,480
I become a fool when I'm with them.
I went to Suseo.

489
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,720
When it's so absurd,
you don't get mad.

490
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,789
I just laughed.
We kept laughing all the way.

491
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:27,690
[Could we possibly win the diamonds?]

492
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:47,970
[The cube was placed
in an unknown place.]

493
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,480
[Where could it be?]

494
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,980
[What's that for?]

495
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,119
[Mr. Gary is sleeping in the cube.]

496
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,259
[He doesn't he's stopped moving
and keeps napping.]

497

[In the middle of a square,
an attraction is opened.]

499
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,579
What are you doing?

500
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,779
I have privacy, too!

501
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,819
[It's awkward for the
people passing by, too.]

502
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,359
Seriously!
Why are you doing this to me?

503
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,759
Please respect my privacy!
You should've told me.

504
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,440
[They don't care about his privacy,
the cube is on display.]

505
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,970
I'm staying here, as
if this was my house.

506
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,210
You can call the two teams, one by one.

[It's time to call SOS again!]

508
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,180
[I need to gather
as many clues as possible.]

509
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,220
[Where is this place?]

510
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:14,400
[He seems many female students.]
Wait a minute.

511
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,759
[There are many cafes and stores.]
Where am I?

512
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,670
Wait!
[Ehwa...]

513
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,039
[He found a crucial clue!]

514
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,069
I saw it clearly!

515
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,839

- Gary!

519
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,859
Kwang Soo!
I have no time!

520
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,619
- Hello!
- Gary!

521
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,430
Jae Suk!
[He has 60 seconds.]

522
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,559
- Where are you?
- I can see the outside.

523
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,670
It's close to Ehwa University!

524
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,170
Ehwa University?

525
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,000
You know that one way
that connects to Ehwa University?

526
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

527
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,609
- I'm right there.
- We'll be there.

528
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,480
Who kidnapped you?

529
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,410
I'll be right there!

530
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,180
I won't ???

531
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,410
??

532
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,079
I told you to do it alone!

533
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,549
Jae Suk!
We've played a game here.

534
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:24,019
You know the place we
played Rolling the Ball?

535
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,890
I know!
On the tray?

536
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,700
- Yes, hurry up!
- I see!

537
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,359
- What tray?
- Let's go!

538
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,019
[Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
played Rolling the Ball.]

539
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,440
We'll go rescue him!
I don't know who they are.

540
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,400
But, I wont ??

541
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,950
You're in my hands!

542
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,660
Let's go!

543
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,599
[Jae Suk's team and Jong Kook's team
are moving toward Ehwa University.]

544
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,920
[Gary rescue team is on the move!]

545
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,349
[Diamond rescue team is on the move!]

546
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,859
[Gary's mission for
escaping cube starts!]

547
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,130
We'll get rid of another sticker
when you succeed at this.

548
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,130
I see.

549
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:07,569
Start now!

550
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:12,539
[Using the spatula, he has to
make the five sticks stay under.]

551
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,940
Do not hurry, there's got to
be an easy way.

552
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:22,009
Are you playing with me?

553
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:28,990
That's it!

554
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,420
[Satisfied]

555
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,529
[He attacks the second bottle.]

556
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,029
[Even with a slight move,
it goes back up.]

557
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,740
[He hit too hard.]

558
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,539
Even the people watching
look embarrassed.

559
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,880
This is embarrassing.

560
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,640
[Mr. Gary is struggling!]

561
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,849
There's no easy way for this.
I need to keep hitting.

562
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,079
Until it works.

563
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,190
I know where Gary is.

564
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,819
He doesn't need to give
us a clue, we know where he is.

565
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,359
I don't know what the mission will be.

566
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,690
If Gary doesn't find the diamonds...

567
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,799
How can we take out the diamonds?

568
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,930
We need to open the door first.

569
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,670
Yes, we do.

570
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:23,339
[If Gary doesn't know
about the diamonds]

571
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:32,410
[they should be underneath the bed.]

572
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,150
Do you think Gary found out?
Or he's just pretending?

573
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,960
They said the diamonds
are underneath the bed?

574
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,460
There's should be a way
that Gary can escape by himself.

575
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,930
If I were trapped somewhere

576
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,299
I'm sure I'd search up the room.

577
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,269
I have to make a left!

578
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,240
What are you doing, Suk Jin!

579
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,740
We were in the middle lane.

580
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,369
[20 minutes passed
since Gary started his mission.]

581
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,480
[Remain calm]

582
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,150
[He successfully gets
the first stick in the water.]

583
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,019
But it'll come up, when I hit this one.

584
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,900
[Be careful what you wish for.]

585
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,269
This drives me crazy.

586
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,710
[He accidentally did it by hand.]

587
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,240
You said I can do this!

588
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,279
[He can do it by either spatula or hand.]
[He has to do it in 30 sec. by hand.]

589
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,950
Please!

590
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:50,089
[Only one stick is left.]

591
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,089
Failed!

592
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,039
[Laugh]

593
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,529
[Such a push and pull!]

594
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:01,029
I don't know why I'm doing this here.

595
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,440
[One tap and all the sticks float.]

596
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:08,240
[Mr. Gary's plays it by hand.]

597
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,440
[He's working on
two bottles at the same time.]

598
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,349
[The maximum concentration]

599
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,640
[In 15 seconds, he got 3 bottles.]

600
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,329
[He's working on the last two bottles.]

601
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:33,059
[Will he succeed this time?]
One

602
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,200
two, success!

603
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,970
[He succeeded at it!]
Okay!

604
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,109
One more number will be removed.

605
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:51,079
[He succeeded at the mission,
one more number will be opened.]

606
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,650
[By the way...]

607
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,619
<i>[Two hours ago, Cheondam Bridge]
[After Gary succeeded at his mission]</i>

608
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,529
<i>[He was enjoying the black bean noodles.]</i>

609
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,509
<i>[The lock...]</i>

610
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:12,859
<i>[A number!]</i>

611
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:16,710
<i>Huh?
Is that a pin number?</i>

612
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,039
<i>Zero is part of the pin number?</i>

613
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,150
<i>You're giving me the pin number!</i>

614
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,259
How many numbers do I need?

615
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,059
[Another number is revealed now.]

616
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:36,730
[The two numbers are zero and one...]

617
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,369
Can I try to open the door?

618
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:41,599
If it opens, I'll escape right away!

619
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,329
[Out of four numbers,
Gary knows two.]

620
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:48,170
[If he's lucky,
he might be able to open!]

621
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,970
When they set a number,
they use a meaningful one.

622
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,839
[Gary's guess: 2016]

623
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,750
[Gary's guess: 1004]

624
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,660
2015.

625
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,400
[Gary's guess: 2015]

626
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,590
[Beep, beep]

627
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,059
What's wrong with this?

628
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,000
[It's so hard to open the door!]

629
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,110
We're almost there.

630
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,969
We're here.
This is one way.

631
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,420
[Jong Kook's team arrives
at Ehwa University.]

632
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,840
- Where is he?
- It must be over there.

633
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,730
[We need to get there first,
so we can get the diamonds.]

634
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,019
They're right there!

635
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:32,849
We're here first, right?

636
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,400
[That's the cube!]

637
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,420
[Gets up]
[Oh my brother!]

638
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,030
- Gary!
- Were you sleeping?

639
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,460
I just started to get comfortable.

640
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,030
What is all that?

641
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,730
For my mission!

642
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,750
[Gary has a mission?]

643
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,639
They gave you a mission, too?
What is the mission for?

644
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,440
I don't know.
They give me numbers.

645
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,280
A number?
They're giving me numbers one by one.

646
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,349
[The pin number?]

647
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,619
[That means Gary can take the
diamonds and escape by himself?]

648
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,059
<i>[The diamonds are
hidden underneath the bed]</i>

649
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,900
<i>They said the diamonds
are under the bed, right?</i>

650
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,099
<i>[Mr. Gary was walking around the bed.]</i>

651
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,139
[Did he find the diamonds?]

652
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,210
[Strong circumstantial evidence!]
[The bed skirt is lifted.]

653
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,519
[Is Gary acting innocent?
Or does he not know a thing?]

654
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,159
<i>If Gary finds the diamonds
in the cube</i>

655
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,760
<i>then he will have a chance to
escape and have them for himself.</i>

656
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,329
["Finding Gary Race"
Get all the treasure and get in the car]

657
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,019
[that the members brought,
and you will be the winner.]

658
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,269
<i>I'm captured here, hurry up and come!</i>

659
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:11,179
[He kept asking for help]

660
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:16,110
[but was he actually aiming
for their car?]

661
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,079
We need to get there first.

662
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,329
[What's the meaning of Gary's smile?]

663
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:24,389
[A fierce battle of wits
for the diamonds begins!]

664
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:27,369
[Two and a half hours passed.]

665
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:32,230
You need to play the game,
and acquire the card key for this door.

666
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,429
I can escape, If you get
the right key quickly.

667
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,599
Then your team will win.

668
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,969
Do you know what the prize is?

669
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:44,059
[Surprised]
They said we'll get a prize later.

670
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:46,079
We'll get something at the end.

671
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,110
I could escape from here,
but it'll hurt my pride.

672
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,519
[How can I say what the prize is?
Maybe it's on your body.]

673
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,119
[We're one step late!]

674
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,119
Gary was sleeping here,
when we got here.

675
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,590
[Jae Suk's team and
Mr. Gary meet again.]

676
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,130
Let me out!

677
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,349
What's that?
Zero and one?

678
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,349
Is that for the mission?

679
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,730
[Every single move he makes
becomes the cause of alarm.]

680
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,400
[Don't take your eyes off Gary!]

681
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,909
[We're watching your every single move!]

682
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:20,710
The mission is a
six-player pinball game.

683
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,510
- The pinball?
- That sounds fun!

684
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,650
You need to bring three citizens.

685
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,750
With them, try and move
the ball to score.

686
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,590
- 50, 100...
- It's 10 points.

687
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,289
You can pick a key for every 30 points.

688
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,789
Okay!

689
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,789
- Do you understand?
- It sounds easy.

690
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,489
Hello!

691
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,429
Try to pick meticulous looking person.

692
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,500
Get a man!

693
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,940
Who wants to play the game with us?

694
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,539
[Me, me, me!]

695
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,269
Hello!

696
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,309
- We need another person.
- My husband!

697
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,010
[A married couple joins Jae Suk's team.]
We have two.

698
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,420
Ji Hyo, you pick a person.

699
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,719
Can you play the game?

700
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,789
Do you have time?

701
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,519
Do you want to play the game with us?

702
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,760
- Do you have time?
- We have one man.

703
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,599
- Do you want to play?
- Yes, I do!

704
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,070
[Both teams recruited their teammates.]

705
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,400
[The result of the game
depends on the citizens!]

706
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,059
Let's start playing.

707
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,059
Good luck!

708
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:28,400
I hope I get lucky,
and get out now.

709
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,750
I'm counting on you!

710
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,710
[So polite]

711
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,679
He can escape from there.

712
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,119
It all depends on you!
I'll get more chances to get out!

713
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,650
Just escape from the window!

714
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,719
Can you hear me?

715
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,789
- Let's play and see.
- Let's see how it is.

716
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:49,630
Get ready!

717
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,760
They must be dating.

718
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,070
They're newly married couple.

719
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,039
The wife strongly
recommended her husband.

720
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,639
We started having a crush on each other
around the time that Running Man started.

721
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,269
Oh, when, around the
first episode of Running Man?

722
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:05,539
They've been together
for all of Running Man.

723
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:07,309
Really?

724
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:10,150
[Jong Kook's team has ten tries,
Jae Suk's team has five tries.]

725
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,619
Ready, set...

726
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,110
[They have less chances, but
they stand a chance of success.]

727
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,659
[If we can open the door,
the diamonds will be ours!]

728
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,679
[The first round starts.]

729
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:24,420
Slowly, slowly!

730
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,500
That's nice!
Good, good!

731
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,300
[The ball moved to the second zone.]

732
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,539
We need to stay calm.

733
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,039
Stay calm!

734
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,880
[They failed at it.]

735
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,969
[Look at that!]

736
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:48,679
[To stir up their mind,
he's acting annoying.]

737
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,320
[Calm down.]

738
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,760
We don't need to hurry.

739
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,659
[Like this?

740
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,389
He's Yoo Black Hole!

741
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:58,489
He can't make the ball go through!

742
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:02,369
Let's do it!
[The second round starts.]

743
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:03,730
We need to yield for each other.

744
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:08,670
Ji Hyo's partner is working so hard!

745
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,969
Good!

746
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:11,869
[Confrontation]

747
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,710
Don't fight between married couple.

748
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,550
One of you needs to yield.

749
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:24,489
That's how the married life is.

750
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,920
[Jae Suk's team failed twice.]

751
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,429
You should step back
for each other.

752
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:35,300
Please don't fight over this game
when you get home.

753
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,170
This is just a game.
Don't put too much meaning to it.

754
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,400
[The third pin ball starts.]

755
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:44,469
[Blank Ji controls the
direction in front.]

756
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:47,010
- This looks good!
- I have a good feeling!

757
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,239
We're so serious.

758
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,349
- They must have figured it out.
- I can't hear anything.

759
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,920
[Shake, shake]

760
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,289
Husband, to the side!
Just like that!

761
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,619
It's good!

762
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:01,659
Slowly, slowly.

763
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,960
[What's the score?]

764
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,139
[Dud!]

765
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,829
[Oh, no!]

766
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,400
[They're blaming each other.]

767
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,670
Dud, dud, dud, dud, duh!

768
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,269
Why are you doing that?

769
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:18,869
He has two names,
Yoo Dud, Yoo Black Hole.

770
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,440
- Yoo Dud, Yoo Black Hole.
- We'll put the rest in 50!

771
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:24,510
[The fourth round starts.]

772
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,449
Good, good!

773
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,420
What good is it if the ball passes

774
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,949
it will end up for a dud.

775
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:35,050
[Let's go, to 50!]

776
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,030
[It went to the hole.]

777
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,630
[What's that?]

778
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,329
[Making fun of him]

779
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,239
[Let's celebrate for the hole-in-one!]

780
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,940
What are you doing?

781
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
I see, I see.

782
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,710
[Their last chance!]
Here we go!

783
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,250
- Good luck!
- There's no time limit.

784
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,150
[Jae Suk switched with Ji Hyo.]

785
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,320
Slowly, slow!

786
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,289
It's okay, do it slowly.

787
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:13,809
Good!
They're in harmony.

788
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,489
[Push is to that side.]

789
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,699
What are you two doing?

790
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,000
- Your life...
- Slowly!

791
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,170
[It's going toward the goal!]

792
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,469
[Jae Suk's team gets 50 points.]

793
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:29,739
[That's nice!]

794
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,909
[From 0 to 50.
What a reversal!]

795
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:35,150
Wow!

796
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:39,250
[We did it!]
It's 50 points!

797
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,480
Good job!

798
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,889
One key card is enough!

799
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:46,820
Thank you for your work!

800
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,500
[Jong Kook's team got here first,
they have 10 chances.]

801
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,969
There's no time limit,
so let's not rush it.

802
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:01,570
Play is slowly!
[The first round starts.]

803
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,070
- Wait, wait.
- Just a little longer, Gary!

804
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,780
Focus!

805
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,139
You need to focus!

806
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:09,710
To that side!

807
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,710
Toward the hole!

808
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,349
It's good!

809
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,820
[It's on the right track!]

810
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,519
Good!

811
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,559
[Emergency, it's going toward the hole.]

812
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,329
[They've avoided the crisis with power.]

813
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,369
[They've acquired 50 points
from the first round.]

814
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:39,539
[You can win at
everything with power!]

815
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,239
We're a team with a monster.

816
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,949
They threw the ball.

817
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,380
[The second round starts.]
Go for 30 points!

818
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,780
30 points!

819
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,619
[They've avoided the hole.]

820
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:54,219
[Surprised]

821
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:58,630
[The ball bounced,
but it passed through.]

822
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:05,099
[The Full Power Brothers
will solve the problem!]

823
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,400
30, 30!

824
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,170
It worked!
[Jong Kook's team acquired 50 points.]

825
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,440
[Nice, Brother!]

826
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,639
Jong Kook's good.

827
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,639
It's terrific!

828
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,980
[The third pin ball starts.]

829
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,349
Slowly, slowly.
It looks good!

830
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:25,119
[Power up!]

831
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:29,460
[Jong Kook's team gains 10 points.]

832
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,820
10 points!

833
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,090
Are you allowed to hit the ball
with the game board?

834
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,460
We're too good!
Don't you think so?

835
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,199
[Power of the two men shines.]

836
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,739
It might go down the hole.

837
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,440
Stop, stop!

838
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,039
Okay!

839
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,610
[Jong Kook's team's current
score is 120 points.]

840
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,969
[The eighth round]
Let's go!

841
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:56,510
[Another 10 pointer.]

842
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,909
[Fantastic, Brother!]

843
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:02,190
- He's hugging him forcefully.
- Why so stiff?

844
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,059
You should go with the flow!

845
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:08,130
[They have 130 points now.]
[It's their last round.]

846
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,030
- Do it slowly.
- Make it flat first.

847
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,400
Look at that.
[A smooth pass]

848
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,500
Let's aim for 50 points!

849
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,010
[This is the last round,
we'll finish it with 50 points!]

850
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,610
[The ball is headed to a hole.]

851
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,380
[What will be the result?]

852
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,309
[50 points!]

853
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,519
[Unbelievable!]

854
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,519
[Jong Kook's team is the best!]

855
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,849
Awesome!

856
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:40,340
[Jong Kook's team scores 180 points.]
[They get to choose six key cards.]

857
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,489
Thank you!

858
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,630
[Thank you for the cooperation!]

859
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,900
Pick the key carefully!

860
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,059
We can use 150 points!

861
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:49,570
[It's time to choose key cards!]

862
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,670
Pick it well!

863
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,500
Suk Jin, pick the right one!

864
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,340
[Jong Kook's team can get 6 keys,
Jae Suk's team can get 1 key.]

865
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,610
Pick the right key!

866
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,309
I don't think it's not among them,
I think it's in the middle.

867
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,829
I think it's this key.

868
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,019
[Following Ha Ha's intuition]

869
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:06,599
Please!

870
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,289
If the door opens,
the light will turn green.

871
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:13,460
If the door opens now,
the recording will be too short.

872
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,750
We'll have to figure something out.

873
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,800
When the key fails,
it'll beep red.

874
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,230
You can try now,
are you ready?

875
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,769
- Please!
- What if it opens now?

876
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:31,010
Please...
[Gary, I'm sorry...]

877
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,210
You can do it!
[but our target is the diamonds!]

878
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,079
[Will the cube open?]

879
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:44,050
[Jae Suk's team's key card fails.]
It's red!

880
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:47,289
What a relief!
It's our turn.

881
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,929
- How many cards, can we have?
- Six.

882
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:55,599
I pick this one.

883
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,530
I'll pick number one.

884
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,239
I wanted to pick two, but...

885
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,369
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
I pick number eight!

886
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,269
[Big-nosed Brother picks no. 8.]

887
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,809
I'll pick another one.

888
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,210
Pick another one, Jong Kook.

889
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,010
Should I pick in the same row?

890
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,679
- Maybe they can open it!
- We have six keys!

891
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,250
You can do it!

892
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,219
The looks on the
filming crews are strange.

893
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,090
Maybe we got the key.

894
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,559
They're bustling!

895
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,829
We must have picked.
[Trying Kwang Soo's key]

896
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:30,760
We six keys, it's possible.

897
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,199
[I'm counting on you!]

898
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,840
[Let's go, Kwang Soo!
To get the diamonds!]

899
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:40,769
[Kwang Soo's key card fails.]

900
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:43,010
Good riddance!

901
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,380
[I can hear you, Jae Suk.]

902
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:49,880
[His checking with the second key.]

903
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,889
Kwang Soo!
[The second key fails.]

904
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:54,119
I don't feel bad about it.

905
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,219
[Big-nosed brother
checks with his key.]

906
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:59,329
For some reason, I think he'll open it.

907
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,360
[Could it be true?]
No, it doesn't.

908
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,199
[He fails to open.]

909
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:07,900
[Anxious]
We have such a high probability!

910
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,969
- It's more than 20 percent.
- Nope!

911
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:13,170
[Big-nose's key card fails again.]
Is it Jong Kook again?

912
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,210
It's going to be a good show,
if I can open it.

913
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,170
The lead character appears
at the end of the show.

914
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,480
[I'm sorry, we'll take the diamonds!]

915
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,789
[Mr. Capable's first key fails.]

916
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:30,960
It wasn't.

917
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,460
Good, good!

918
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,559
What a good actor!

919
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,429
I have one key left.

920
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,559
[Nervous]

921
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,369
Please, please!
[This is the last chance!]

922
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,170
[The one who wants to open the
door and earn the diamonds...]

923
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,380
[The one who might be
hiding his real intention.]

924
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,380
[How will it end?]

925
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,949
[To be continued
at the next location...]

926
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:02,789
I knew it.
[Disappointed]

927
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:04,420
[Sigh]

928
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,519
It doesn't open.

929
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:08,730
Galory, see you soon!

930
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,760
Among these keys...
try number 29.

931
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,969
- I was going to pick it.
- Don't lie to me!

932
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:18,340
We really thought about that.

933
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,170
We almost picked it.

934
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,739
- It opens.
- It's that one?

935
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,739
Come out through the window.

936
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:29,110
Do you think it'll work?

937
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,579
It's the rule.
I'd go out if I'm allowed.

938
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,179
Should I go out like this now?

939
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,590
I can't get out
because of my pride.

940
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,590
[I won't crawl just to get out.]

941
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,630
Please, move him quickly.

942
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,559
I'll tell you all the details,
come quickly!

943
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:51,900
Gary, see you!

944
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,909
See you!
[See you again!]

945
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:01,179
[Does Gary know about the
existence of the diamonds?]

946
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:09,789
<i>[He was circling around
the diamonds.]</i>

947
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:13,960
<i>then he'll have a chance
of winning by himself.</i>

948
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,329
<i>[To get the members' car,
he keeps calling them for rescue.]</i>

949
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:20,260
[He looks more and
more suspicious.]

950
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,300
[What's the real
intention of Mr. Gary?]

951
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,239
[Gary cube, the third location]

952
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,280
[A river, and a field of reeds]

953
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,949
[Mr. Gary's cube is in
the middle of the reeds.]

954
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,059
[What will I see this time?]

955
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,730
[What... is this unfamiliar scenery?]

956
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,340
Where am I?

957
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,170
I have no idea where I am.

958
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:12,650
[What he can see are the river]

959
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,079
[a field of reeds]

960
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:17,820
[and an unidentified chimney.]

961
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,119
[He's trapped in a mysterious place.]

962
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,389
I have no idea what so ever!

963
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:33,530
[From a distance, he can see a bridge.]
Wait a minute.

964
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,269
Is that a bridge?

965
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:39,329
[Where in the world could Gary be?]

966
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:42,260
[At that time,
Running Man members are...]

967
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,280
Gary couldn't possibly
have found the treasure, could he?

968
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,599
I think Gary's doing
something on his own.

969
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,460
It's not about escaping.

970
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,349
I think he knows about the treasure.

971
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:55,929
What are the numbers on the wall?

972
00:51:55,929 --> 00:52:01,989
I think they're giving him numbers
when he finishes his mission.

973
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:05,460
So, he can open the door by himself,
and escape?

974
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,769
[Gary can escape without
the members' help?]

975
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:11,820
He knows about
the diamonds, right?

976
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,130
Did he figure it out?
I don't think he knows.

977
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,199
He's calling!

978
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:20,199
[Gary called them right on time.]

979
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:22,780
Hello!

980
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,239
- Listen carefully, all I see is reeds.
- Reeds?

981
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:31,639
I'm sure it's one of the
parks near Han River.

982
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:34,530
- A park near Han River?
- He can see reeds?

983
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,170
- Anything else?
- A lot of reeds...

984
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,039
Anything else, such as a building?

985
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,110
I'm not sure, if I'm the
north side of the river.

986
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,510
From very far off, I see newly
built buildings in Yongsan.

987
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,639
[Putting her brain to work]

988
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,840
I'm in the middle of a field of reeds.

989
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,250
You're across the river from Yongsan?

990
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,710
I think so.

991
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,769
You know the part
in the middle of the river.

992
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:08,730
It's somewhat similar to that park.

993
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,440
On the left, there's a
thermal power plant.

994
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,929
By any chance, are you on an island?

995
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,530
I have no idea.

996
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,510
The chimney of Dangin-ri power plant.

997
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,619
I can see the chimney from here.

998
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:23,039
You see the Dangin-ri power plant?

999
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,860
The chimney, I can see the chimney.

1000
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,880
Ha Ha...

1001
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,510
[Ace Song Ji Hyo, has a hunch!]

1002
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,280
I don't think it's near Olympic park.

1003
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,369
- I think I know where it is.
- Let's go!

1004
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:36,860
Wait, wait!

1005
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,130
Wait!
[He can see something though the hole?]

1006
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,150
A windmill?

1007
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:49,460
You know the thing that
looks like a Ferris wheel?

1008
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,480
There are three of them on the hill.

1009
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,329
You need to give us more details!

1010
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,880
And they're building a bridge.

1011
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,059
- A bridge?
- They're building a new bridge.

1012
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:03,349
I know it!

1013
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,530
[Big-nose is getting ready.]
There are only reeds!

1014
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,349
- Find me quickly!
- Let's go!

1015
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:10,199
Where's the new bridge?

1016
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,199
Let's go!

1017
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,679
We know where it is.

1018
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:19,059
Where in the world am I?

1019
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,860
[Jae Suk's team is moving toward Mapo.]

1020
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,329
- I think he's in Najido.
- You're right.

1021
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,500
You know the wind farm,
the wind turbines.

1022
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,570
He said there are three of them.

1023
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,639
- And the bridge...
- Yes, they're building a new bridge.

1024
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,309
On the way to the airport,
they're building a bridge.

1025
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,280
It's Nanjido, then.

1026
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,980
If we can't solve it this time,
or next time

1027
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,420
Then, Gary will win this race.

1028
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,719
It's confusing.

1029
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,460
The new bridge is on
the way to Gimpo airport.

1030
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,030
Where should I go?
Should I go that way?

1031
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,300
But where should we go?
Should we go toward Hapjeong?

1032
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,269
- Go straight here.
- Straight?

1033
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:04,269
- Are you sure?
- Ah.. just go straight.

1034
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,469
- We should go this way.
- No.

1035
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,070
Should I go straight
and make a right?

1036
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,750
You said you know where it is.

1037
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:17,219
We should've taken the other way.
Then, it could've been short.

1038
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:18,880
[Kkuk is scolding Big-nose navigation.]

1039
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,619
You're right.

1040
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:24,880
Are you a spy?

1041
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,659
- I'm not a spy.
- Then, why?

1042
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:31,099
- We had no reason to come this way.
- How about making a u-turn?

1043
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,130
Can we even do the mission?

1044
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,230
[They're moving toward the new bridge.]

1045
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:39,309
[In the middle of the reeds]

1046
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:42,510
[a man is left alone.]

1047
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,809
How can I untangle this?
[He's doing the mission.]

1048
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:50,079
Honestly, it's harder to
make it tangle like this.

1049
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,440
Doing this mission is one thing

1050
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:59,730
but I don't think the
members can find me here.

1051
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,960
[Jae Suk's team is on
the way to Nanjido.]

1052
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Where is it?

1053
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,769
- The wind turbines...
- Only Nanji Park has the wind turbines.

1054
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,840
[A field of reeds]

1055
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,809
And he saw the chimney.

1056
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:19,480
It's in the middle of the river.

1057
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,809
Maybe Seonyu Island?

1058
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:23,610
It could be!

1059
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,150
I was thinking about Seonyu Island.

1060
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,449
Think about what he said.

1061
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,289
<i>"You know the park in
the middle of the river?"</i>

1062
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:33,820
<i>"It's somewhat similar to that park."</i>

1063
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,889
"In the middle of the river..."
He said that.

1064
00:56:36,889 --> 00:56:40,300
That's why I thought
about Seonyu Island.

1065
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,300
I think so, too.

1066
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,599
From Seonyu Island,
you can see everything.

1067
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,869
You can see Han River,
and Dangin-ri power plant.

1068
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,369
And it's the island
in the middle of the river.

1069
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,809
The bridge is over there.

1070
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:54,539
Is it far?
Can we see Yongsan from here?

1071
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:57,309
We can't.

1072
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:58,980
Yongsan is far from here.

1073
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,519
I can't see Yongsan from here.

1074
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:03,349
[Yongsan is too far...]

1075
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:06,190
- Isn't that a field of reeds?
- Isn't that Bamseom?

1076
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,920
[Could Gary be inside Bamseom?]

1077
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,840
[Jae Suk's team is
headed to Seonyu Island.]

1078
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,619
There are reeds everywhere!

1079
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:20,659
That's why I thought it's here.

1080
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:23,619
From there, you can...
see the wind turbines!

1081
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:26,110
The chimney is over there!

1082
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,079
- Over there!
- Can we enter the park from here?

1083
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,619
Ji Hyo, can we enter the park?

1084
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,679
You could also cross Seongsan Bridge

1085
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,320
and soon you can
go onto Yanghwa Bridge.

1086
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,019
Ji Hyo knows all the parks.

1087
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:46,360
[Ask anything.]

1088
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,679
I'll listen to you.

1089
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,460
Ji Hyo is amazing!

1090
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,170
There's usually traffic over there.

1091
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,079
Ji Hyo is the queen of parks.

1092
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,110
Can I take this road, Ji Hyo?

1093
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:02,210
Yes, toward the blue tunnel,
and to Seongsan Bridge.

1094
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,130
She's like a tour guide for parks.

1095
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,599
You'll see parking soon.

1096
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:10,349
[Thanks to Blank navigation]

1097
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:12,250
[they arrive at the park quickly.]
Did he say pinwheels?

1098
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,989
We've recorded here before.
See?

1099
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,960
I'll get out and ask.

1100
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,059
[Run]

1101
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:26,199
Excuse me,
did you see a container

1102
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:30,110
Kang Gary is in a white box.
Have you seen it?

1103
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,710
[Kang Gary?]

1104
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,670
He's calling!

1105
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:36,639
Hello!

1106
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,530
Ha Ha, can you tell us where it is?

1107
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,309
We have no idea.

1108
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,280
Where are you?

1109
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,480
We have absolutely no idea now.

1110
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,239
You do?

1111
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,260
Should I tell them or not?

1112
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,880
Just tell them.

1113
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,039
Just come to Seonyu Island Park.

1114
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:00,929
[Ha Ha is sharing the information
that they're not sure of.]

1115
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:03,949
- Are you sure?
- Okay, thank you!

1116
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:05,420
We should keep this lane.

1117
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:09,570
You don't see it?

1118
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,539
[Shake, shake]

1119
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,570
There's no container in the park?

1120
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,800
[The cube is not in
Seonyu Island Park?]

1121
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,719
[All the conditions are met,
but it's not Seonyu Island Park?]

1122
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,530
He said they're not here.

1123
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,730
Ji Hyo, he said it's not?

1124
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,079
Then, the only option is Nanji Park.

1125
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,059
Should we check Sky Park?

1126
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:41,840
By the way, where's
Jong Kook's team now?

1127
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,139
I told them to come here.

1128
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:47,639
I think Jong Kook's team
will be here first.

1129
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,250
For some reason.
[Gary's still tries untangling it.]

1130
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:56,280
This is frustrating.
My pride has been hurt.

1131
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,820
But, I'm doing it.

1132
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:03,150
Did you think I couldn't do it?

1133
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,079
I can do anything
once I've set my mind to it.

1134
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,619
It's all good now!

1135
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,000
Success!

1136
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,909
- Huh?
- What?

1137
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,110
- I received a text message.
- It's a picture!

1138
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,710
Is it one of the parks
near Han River?

1139
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,980
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

1140
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,480
Where is it?

1141
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,320
There's a swimming pool.
It was Nanji Park.

1142
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,619
Should I exit this road here?

1143
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:36,840
- Not here, at the next intersection...
- Near the bridge, no?

1144
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,510
- You can make a u-turn.
- We're allowed?

1145
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,530
- Under the tunnel.
- Haengju Fortress?

1146
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,510
- No, over here.
- How do you know the road so well?

1147
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,000
She knows all the parks
that's good to date.

1148
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,420
[Blank Navigation is the best!]

1149
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,820
- Okay, okay.
- Three pin wheels.

1150
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,510
[All they need to do is,
to get there before Jong Kook's!]

1151
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,949
[Jong Kook's team was
headed to Seonyu Island.]

1152
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:08,889
[Kwang Soo is checking Gary's message.]

1153
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:11,460
He sent GPS coordinates on a map.

1154
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,829
He's telling us to go there?

1155
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:14,619
Youth Plaza, Nanji Hangang Park?

1156
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:19,730
They tricked us.
They told us to come to Seonyu Island.

1157
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,429
But it was Nanji Park.

1158
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,869
- It's Nanji Park?
- Yes.

1159
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:27,610
Are you sure? [Wait until I
get my hands on you, Ha Ha.]

1160
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:34,409
[Jae Suk's team is
arriving at the park.]

1161
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:36,780
They're building the bridge here.

1162
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,619
Who are they?
There are people.

1163
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:41,090
- It's right here.
- Can you pass me my jacket?

1164
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:42,920
[They don't have much time.]

1165
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:46,989
Reed field!
We need to look for the reeds!

1166
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:49,929
I can see the bridge
construction from here.

1167
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:52,360
If we can't see him,
it means Gary escaped.

1168
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,329
It should be somewhere here.

1169
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,869
It's over here!

1170
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:02,369
- Ji Hyo!
- Where are you?

1171
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:07,280
Where are you, Jae Suk?

1172
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,210
[I found Kang Gary!]

1173
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:13,179
[Why did he come so far in?]

1174
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,989
They're here!

1175
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:18,420
Gary!

1176
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,260
- Gary!
- There's only ten minutes!

1177
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,260
[They need to succeed in ten minutes!]

1178
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,530
Gary, what are those numbers?

1179
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,199
Every time I succeed a mission,
I get a number.

1180
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:30,469
- Oh really?
- Yes.

1181
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:33,039
I can get out, but I don't know how.

1182
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:35,369
Where's the pinwheel?

1183
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:37,110
It's right there!

1184
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,139
[It's all the way over there...]

1185
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:41,039
Oh my god, Gary!

1186
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,710
And it was me
who understood "windmill"!

1187
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:48,050
- Yeah, pinwheel!
- How's that a pinwheel?

1188
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,190
You said ??

1189
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,789
[That's Nanji Park...]

1190
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:53,619
How am I supposed to know?

1191
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:54,619
My god!

1192
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:58,130
- What's the mission?
- There's ten minutes left!

1193
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,400
Hurry, hurry!

1194
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,500
Zone one is black, zone two is gray,
and zone three is blue.

1195
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,239
All three of you have to
shoot and get it in.

1196
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,440
I'll be in the blue zone,
you go in the black zone.

1197
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,610
- Dong Hoon!
- Good luck, Ji Hyo!

1198
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:14,909
Ready!

1199
01:03:14,909 --> 01:03:17,409
Start!

1200
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,719
[Ace Ji Hyo passed.]

1201
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:24,119
I like this team.

1202
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,360
[Yoo Hyuk passed as well.]

1203
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:33,329
[They'll get one key card
if Ha Ha passes...]

1204
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,869
[Ha Ha failed.]
Ha Dong Hoon!

1205
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:40,739
Just wait.

1206
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:43,500
[There's no time to lose!]

1207
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,309
[They're already on their second try.]

1208
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,679
Ji Hyo's the best.

1209
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:53,380
[Jae Suk got it in!]

1210
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,320
[It's Ha Ha's turn again.]

1211
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,590
[Shoot!]

1212
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:03,460
[There can't be another mistake!]

1213
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,559
This is driving me crazy...

1214
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:08,730
[Haroro failed again.]

1215
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,500
[Ha Ha's known to like basketball...]

1216
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,170
Don't you go to basketball meet ups?

1217
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,099
This is so frustrating!

1218
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,670
What are you doing!

1219
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:20,210
[Ji Hyo goals in once again.]

1220
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,050
[Yoo Hyuk goals in,
three times in a row!]

1221
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,150
Go a little closer.

1222
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,179
[I will get it in.]

1223
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:33,719
[Please, Dong Hoon!]

1224
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:37,789
[He clears his mind and shoots!]

1225
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:41,289
No!

1226
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:44,300
[He threw it, but failed again!]

1227
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Are you crazy?

1228
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,670
[Get your head together!]

1229
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,469
He sucks at basketball.

1230
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,340
This is driving me crazy!
Why isn't it going in?

1231
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,909
He can't get it in!
Come closer!

1232
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:58,309
This is for real!

1233
01:04:59,179 --> 01:05:02,480
[While Ha Ha is making mistakes]

1234
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,659
[Jong Kook's team arrived
near Nanji Park.]

1235
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,090
There's construction over there.

1236
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:12,159
Oh, we found it?

1237
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,190
There's not much time.

1238
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,590
There's no time.

1239
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,829
It's somewhere around here.

1240
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,369
[Rushing]

1241
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:26,570
[They got the location of
the cube with eagle eyes.]

1242
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,869
The other team's here.

1243
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:30,869
[Jae Suk's team is still
having a hard time.]

1244
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,909
Wow, and you said
it was Seonyudo Park!

1245
01:05:35,909 --> 01:05:38,849
[They can't hear anything.]

1246
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:41,690
[Goal in!]

1247
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,489
How many minutes are left?

1248
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:45,420
[They're continuing
without any breaks.]

1249
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,960
Hurry and throw it!

1250
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,329
- What am I doing?
- Listen to the explanation!

1251
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:51,489
You have two tries left!

1252
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,960
How much time do we have?

1253
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,230
[Unbelievable Blank Ji,
nine goals in a row!]

1254
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,269
[Jae Suk is also getting
a steady score.]

1255
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:01,869
[And today's Black Hole, Ha Ha]

1256
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:04,210
[succeeded, too.]
It's your last chance!

1257
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,980
[So far, they've
acquired two key cards.]

1258
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,239
[It's Jae Suk's team's last chance.]

1259
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,980
[Ace Song Ji Hyo succeeded
with 100 percent rate.]

1260
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:14,179
Great!

1261
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,119
If Dong Hun fails, they're done, right?

1262
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:19,250
Dong Hun?

1263
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,760
[Haroro's got the hang of it now,
will he succeed at his last shot?]

1264
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:26,599
[Two out of ten,
they've acquired two card keys.]

1265
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:29,059
You're really good at it,
what's wrong with you?

1266
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:31,130
- I can go first.
- No, let me do it.

1267
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,929
First attempt!

1268
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:36,400
[Big-nosed Brother silently
failed the first attempt.]

1269
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,309
- Second attempt!
- No!

1270
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:40,039
[Bounce]

1271
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:41,039
[He failed twice already.]

1272
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,639
This is frustrating!

1273
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:45,880
You have three more attempts.

1274
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,150
[Enthusiastic]

1275
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,579
You have two more attempts.

1276
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,219
What's wrong with you?

1277
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,949
[No matter what, this time...]

1278
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:56,159
[I'll fail...]

1279
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:58,389
Suk Jin failed four times.

1280
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,489
[He's trying to be funny, right?]

1281
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:05,070
[Their last chance,
Kkuk starts and succeeds.]

1282
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,929
Jong Kook did it,
so you can do it.

1283
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:08,869
Can I throw from here?

1284
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:13,510
[Cack-handed Big-nose,
finally succeeded at it.]

1285
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,039
[Jong Kook's teams last shooter,
Giraffe]

1286
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,349
[Without any practice,
he succeeds at it!]

1287
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:22,050
[Goal in!]

1288
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:26,420
[One out of five,
they've acquired one key card.]

1289
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,460
[Will they be able to get me out?]

1290
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,190
You only have two minutes left
to put the card.

1291
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:34,230
Ji Hyo, you pick!

1292
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:37,260
[Why did Big-nose Brother pick?]

1293
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,800
[They chose the key cards.]
Let's go.

1294
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:44,070
Please!
[Did they pick the real key?]

1295
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,940
- There's another number?
- 0, 1, and 2?

1296
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,909
They give me a number after
every succeeded mission.

1297
01:07:49,909 --> 01:07:52,340
- What number?
- The pin number!

1298
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:55,409
The pin number!

1299
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,550
[They're giving him the pin number?]

1300
01:07:58,119 --> 01:07:59,789
How many numbers are there?

1301
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:01,590
I think four.

1302
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,219
So if you get one more number,
you can get out?

1303
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:05,090
I don't know the order, though.

1304
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,360
Do you have a limited number
of tries for the pin?

1305
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,659
No, it'll break in five tries.

1306
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:14,429
- It'll break?
- No, I meant...

1307
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:17,229
You're weird... what do you mean break?

1308
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:18,739
Are you suspicious of me?

1309
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:21,739
I'm not!
Look at me!

1310
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:24,439
I'm not lying!

1311
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,180
[Is this real or acting...]

1312
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,350
I'm not lying!
Look!

1313
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,920
[Look at my innocent eyes!]

1314
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,220
I'm telling you the truth!

1315
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:38,560
[They try Ha Ha's key card first!]

1316
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,590
[Did he pick the right one?]

1317
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,000
It's not it!

1318
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:47,930
[Failed]

1319
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,399
[They have one card each.]

1320
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,800
[Is Ji Hyo's key the real one?]

1321
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,439
[Failed]

1322
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:56,439
- Is there even a key?
- It's in the middle, right?

1323
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:58,970
Could it be?

1324
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:02,970
[What about the icon of misfortune,
Big Nose?]

1325
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:05,319
None of them work?

1326
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,979
[Just like the expected.]

1327
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:10,489
[They ran out of time.]

1328
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,260
[They failed to open
the cube at Nanji Park!]

1329
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,319
[Gary is getting hints
for the pin...]

1330
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:18,960
Try to explain it well.

1331
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,100
I'll only explain what's close then.

1332
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,430
No, if it's far then
tell us that it's far!

1333
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,970
- Okay, okay!
- How is that a ??

1334
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,539
[Sad...]

1335
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:33,109
Gary!

1336
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:35,010
[Gary and the diamonds
are heading to]

1337
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:37,880
[another location,
putting the members behind.]

1338
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,119
[Jae Suk's team, Jong Kook's team,
or Gary?]

1339
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:42,520
[Who will be owner of the diamonds?]

1340
01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:50,489
[The cube has arrived.]

1341
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,960
[Where could it be?]

1342
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:03,539
[The window is opened.]

1343
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:08,180
[Half-asleep, half-awake]

1344
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:10,539
[Where am I now?]

1345
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:15,880
[Let me see.]

1346
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,350
What's that?

1347
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:20,189
How can I read that?
[A building with an English sign.]

1348
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,329
[I need to find the clue
and call the members...]

1349
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:32,000
[A parking lot?]
[A flag?]

1350
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
[He can't figure it out
from the front window.]

1351
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,869
[He's looking through
the revealed glass.]

1352
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:39,939
Isn't it?
I think so.

1353
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:45,579
[In front of a supermarket in Mok-dong]

1354
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,239
[a big building?]

1355
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:52,180
Could it be SBS?

1356
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:55,350
Wait... yes, it is!

1357
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,029
It's pretty cold today.

1358
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:01,930
- Gary's calling!
- He is!

1359
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:05,329
Yes, Gary!

1360
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,329
- Kwang Soo.
- Where are you?

1361
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:10,640
SBS in Mok-dong.
Hurry up!

1362
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,739
Where are you now?

1363
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:15,539
[They're on the move.]
That's a simple answer!

1364
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,109
Hello?

1365
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:25,550
They're so cold.
Are they just playing game only?

1366
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,090
They're not really thinking
about rescuing me?

1367
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:32,020
[I'll see you later...]

1368
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,689
Let's go!

1369
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,329
[The destination is set,
go straight to SBS!]

1370
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:38,659
[Jae Suk's team is heading
to SBS without stopping!]

1371
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:43,569
[Jong Kook's team leaves, too.]
[It's good to be there first.]

1372
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:54,930
[He has to shoot five empty yogurt
bottles in a row with an blowgun.]

1373
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,449
Who can do this??

1374
01:11:57,449 --> 01:12:00,250
[He'll be able to get the last number
if he succeeds at it.]

1375
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,020
[Shoot]

1376
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:09,279
[He has to get the tiny yogurt bottles.]

1377
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:11,550
There must be a way to aim at it.

1378
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:17,069
Okay, I think I got it.

1379
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,640
[It hit the door and did a bank shot.]

1380
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,380
It worked, right?
It doesn't matter how!

1381
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,050
Why am I doing this?

1382
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:37,949
The members will...

1383
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,390
[The rule was only delivered to
the members this morning.]

1384
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:45,829
[The diamonds that are]

1385
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,130
[hidden underneath the bed.]

1386
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,529
[Another rule for when Gary finds out
about the diamonds.]

1387
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:54,539
<i>He will have a chance
of winning by himself.</i>

1388
01:12:55,970 --> 01:13:00,840
[Does Gary know about this and
is just waiting for the members?]

1389
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,649
Gary doesn't know, right?

1390
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:08,149
I think he knows.

1391
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:09,520
- About the diamonds?
- Yes.

1392
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,920
He keeps saying that he doesn't know.

1393
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:17,260
But I'm sure that he knows.

1394
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:20,829
I think Gary knows
about the diamonds.

1395
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,300
He knows for sure.

1396
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,300
[They're also sure that he knows.]

1397
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:26,430
[Who will be the winner?]

1398
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:33,189
[At this time,
Gary is using the blow gun.]

1399
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:35,840
[Focused]

1400
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:40,250
Okay!

1401
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:46,050
[He's surprised, too.]

1402
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,750
[One shot, two kills!]

1403
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:54,020
You thought I couldn't do it?

1404
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,829
Do you see anything I'm not good at?

1405
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,770
[Bank shot, again!]

1406
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,510
I hope this will end now.

1407
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,439
Two at once!

1408
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,340
[Shoot]

1409
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,180
[Again, he hit two at once!]
Yes!

1410
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:20,649
[He completes his mission perfectly.]

1411
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:24,390
You thought I couldn't do this?

1412
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,229
[The last pass code will be revealed.]

1413
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,930
The first number was this,
and the second was that?

1414
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:35,329
[He can call the members again.]

1415
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:37,439
Gary?

1416
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,840
Suk Jin, I've finished my mission

1417
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,010
I got another number.

1418
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,810
The four numbers are 1, 0, 2, 7.

1419
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,079
What do you think the pin number is?

1420
01:14:52,819 --> 01:14:56,819
- It's four digits, right?
- If you press the number and get out...

1421
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:59,420
I can get out.

1422
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,829
What good is there for me
if I get out now?

1423
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:06,829
- Don't come out now.
- Guess the pin number, Kwang Soo!

1424
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:07,829
Yes?

1425
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,470
Do you think he really doesn't know?

1426
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,510
I think he means it.

1427
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,510
But the way he hung up the phone...

1428
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,979
Why did he have to shout my name?

1429
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:21,810
I think he's doing it on purpose.

1430
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,750
Maybe he found the diamonds now.

1431
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:28,789
Maybe he came out?

1432
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:33,420
[Gary acquired 0, 7, 1, 2.]

1433
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:36,560
They wouldn't make it easy as 2017.

1434
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,239
[He has to figure out the
combination of the pin number.]

1435
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:41,829
[Could it be...]

1436
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:46,439
Did Running Man start
broadcasting in July?

1437
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:49,670
- I'm not sure.
- I think it is.

1438
01:15:50,539 --> 01:15:54,279
The first episode of
Running Man was in July.

1439
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:57,250
0, 7!

1440
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:01,149
1, 2!
July, 12th!

1441
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:03,250
[Quiet]

1442
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:07,960
It's not?
[Too bad, it was July 11.]

1443
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,189
[Then, what could it be?]

1444
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:14,659
I'm just going to press it randomly.
2...

1445
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:20,170
7,1,0!

1446
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,140
[It's not?]

1447
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:31,140
7,0,1,2!

1448
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,380
[What?]

1449
01:16:36,949 --> 01:16:41,569
[Seriously?]

1450
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:46,390
I opened it!

1451
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,529
[It happens?]
What is it?

1452
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:53,270
I opened it!

1453
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:56,199
Excuse me, I drooled
because I was so happy.

1454
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:59,130
[Hooray!]

1455
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:02,310
I opened it too early, didn't I?

1456
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:04,680
Was is just a random number?

1457
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,810
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

1458
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:10,079
Number 7012 is too embarrassing?

1459
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:11,380
I can't say it.

1460
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,649
Seven Running Man...

1461
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,720
I'm right!

1462
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:21,029
Seven Running Man, forever!
[012 (yeong-one-ee: forever)]

1463
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:24,829
[Laugh]

1464
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,840
We're almost there!

1465
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,310
Jae Suk, Dong Hun!

1466
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,779
- What is it?
- I'm out!

1467
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:45,720
[What?]
[He's out?]

1468
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,420
- I'm out!
- Are you serious?

1469
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,260
What was the pin number?

1470
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,489
- Pardon?
- Pin number.

1471
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:55,729
- It's too embarrassing.
- Tell us!

1472
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:57,500
It's really embarrassing.

1473
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,960
What is it?

1474
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,039
You'll be able to tell, if I say it.
7012.

1475
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:07,039
012, forever... something?

1476
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:09,670
- Seven Running Man...
- Oh, no...

1477
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:12,079
Stop, don't say it!

1478
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:15,550
- I can't tell you more.
- Don't!

1479
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:19,149
Seven Running Man...
I can't stand it already.

1480
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:22,319
- Where are you?
- We're in front of SBS.

1481
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:24,789
Hurry up, I've escaped.
It's over.

1482
01:18:24,789 --> 01:18:27,590
- Which floor are you on?
- I'm on the ground.

1483
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,960
- Okay, I see.
- On the ground.

1484
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:34,800
- Did he take the diamonds?
- That's what I'm wondering.

1485
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,770
I don't think he knows.

1486
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:39,069
It seems that he doesn't know.

1487
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:41,199
[But why does he want us to hurry?]

1488
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,510
This is too easy.

1489
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:47,909
[Did Gary find the diamonds?]

1490
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:56,520
<i>[If Gary found the diamonds,
the only thing he needs is their car.]</i>

1491
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,789
<i>[Gary has been trapped
in the cube all day long.]</i>

1492
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:07,000
<i>[Did he find the hidden diamonds
underneath the bed?]</i>

1493
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,529
<i>He's different now.</i>

1494
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:10,500
<i>The door breaks, if I put the
wrong number five times.</i>

1495
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,229
<i>He's suspicious.</i>

1496
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:13,739
<i>Are you doubting?</i>

1497
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:17,909
<i>[He pleaded his innocence
with the over action.]</i>

1498
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:20,439
[Could it be real?]

1499
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:23,649
[Or was he acting?]

1500
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:28,619
We need to get there fast,
I'll go inside the cube.

1501
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:30,649
Keep Gary busy with you.

1502
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:32,689
I'll do that.

1503
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:35,789
We need to show the diamonds
in front of the camera to win.

1504
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,159
- Gary...
- He's outside.

1505
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:44,619
[Jae Suk's team arrives.]

1506
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:47,239
[And Gary is watching them.]

1507
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:49,970
[They're here!]

1508
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:58,529
He's not acting while
he's carrying the diamonds, is he?

1509
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:02,529
[They all got off the car...]

1510
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:05,750
<i>Gary thinks it's about
you rescuing him.</i>

1511
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:11,489
[Gary is walking toward the car?]

1512
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:15,359
[Is he aiming for the car?]

1513
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:17,060
You escaped!

1514
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,430
- What about the seven Running Man?
- What seven Running Man?

1515
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,329
It's too embarrassing!

1516
01:20:21,329 --> 01:20:23,970
[Jae Suk's team is
carrying out their plan.]

1517
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,810
[While Ji Hyo is holding onto Gary]

1518
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:32,079
[Ha Ha is searching the cube.]

1519
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,619
[Big-nose is rushing, too.]

1520
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:41,149
What's going on?

1521
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:46,359
[Ha Ha checks the bed first.]

1522
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:48,329
Search for it!

1523
01:20:48,329 --> 01:20:51,659
[Are the diamonds still here?]

1524
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:56,100
Where is it?
It's here!

1525
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:02,069
[It's still there?]

1526
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:04,039
What's that?

1527
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:07,279
[What is it?]

1528
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:12,079
[No way...
he really didn't know?]

1529
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:17,149
<i>[Without knowing why,
Gary was trapped since morning.]</i>

1530
01:21:18,289 --> 01:21:21,729
<i>[The bed that the diamonds are hidden.]</i>

1531
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:25,659
<i>[To Gary who doesn't know about it]</i>

1532
01:21:25,659 --> 01:21:30,600
<i>[It was just a temporary chair
for his meal.]</i>

1533
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:35,109
<i>[Even when the bed skirt was lifted]</i>

1534
01:21:35,109 --> 01:21:38,130
<i>This is warm.
[It was just a warm nest for him.]</i>

1535
01:21:39,579 --> 01:21:41,479
<i>[During the mission...]</i>

1536
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,979
<i>[he picked up the darts.]</i>

1537
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:46,819
<i>[If only he turned his head...]</i>

1538
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,119
<i>[But he doesn't doubt at all...]</i>

1539
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,119
<i>[He was next to the bed all the long.]</i>

1540
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:57,430
<i>[But he couldn't even
see a sight of a diamond.]</i>

1541
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,199
<i>[Just by doing his missions]</i>

1542
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:04,369
<i>[acquired the pin numbers
one by one.]</i>

1543
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:10,939
<i>[He went through hell
and high water to escape.]</i>

1544
01:22:10,939 --> 01:22:14,939
<i>[It seems that the day
ends like that.]</i>

1545
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:24,510
[Why is this chaos
happening before me?]

1546
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:28,159
Ji Hyo!

1547
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,689
What's that?

1548
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:31,689
[He gives it to Ji Hyo
through the doggy door.]

1549
01:22:31,689 --> 01:22:34,100
[but surrounded right away.]
What's that?

1550
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,029
What is that?
Let me see!

1551
01:22:39,029 --> 01:22:41,840
It belongs to Gary.
Let's give it to Gary.

1552
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,609
Seven Running Man, forever!

1553
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:48,640
- Get lost!
- Seven Running Man, forever!

1554
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,909
What's that?

1555
01:22:50,909 --> 01:22:54,449
[Scattered]
[The diamonds fell on the ground.]

1556
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:56,020
No!

1557
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:58,449
[Pick up the diamonds!]

1558
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:00,250
No!

1559
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,260
[What's the ruckus?]
What's that?

1560
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:08,729
- Just get going!
- Get off!

1561
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:10,199
[Remain silent, if you don't know.]

1562
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:16,140
The moment the diamonds scattered

1563
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,930
was like a movie!

1564
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,640
Greedy humans!

1565
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,420
The black team won?
[The diamonds were thrown.]

1566
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:28,750
[No winners today.]
Ji Hyo is the queen of Han River.

1567
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,920
Queen of parks.
She knows all the entrances to parks.

1568
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,489
I see what kind of date you enjoy.

1569
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:37,159
You're amazing.
[She like to date secretly in the park?]

1570
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:40,229
After all, I opened the door.
Will you give me some?

1571
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:42,529
I opened the door for
them to take the diamonds?

1572
01:23:42,529 --> 01:23:46,399
- It turned out like that.
- You open the door for thieves.

1573
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,329
The seven of us
are a team forever.

1574
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:51,199
Don't make me laugh!

1575
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:53,609
We're one.

1576
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:55,810
We were so bad at telling direction.

1577
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,279
This is upsetting.

1578
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,779
- You should've taken Seongsan Bridge.
- You were sleeping!

1579
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,020
We need to go drink together now!

1580
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,890
Why did you drive?

1581
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,189
You were snoring just now.

1582
01:24:10,189 --> 01:24:13,775
[Thank you for chasing,
and being trapped.]

1583
