1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,664
- I don't like this show.
- Tell him to get out here!

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:06,926
Why are you making me do that?
I don't like this, I don't want to do it.

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:11,099
- What is this? Just hurry it up.
- Lee Seo Jin is making me mad!

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:13,139
[It all starts now.]

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:17,431
[A snowy white winter day.]

6
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:20,007
['N' Hotel in Incheon]

7
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:25,069
[A lone man in a hotel room.]

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,643
[Lee Seung Gi]

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,945
- I've asked you to meet me in secrecy.
- Yes, I've noticed that.

10
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:37,403
Yes, it was so that I could
give you your special mission.

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,457
Can I take a look at it?

12
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,129
Wait.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,401
Oust all eight members by
secretly eliminating their name tags.

14
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,486
[Oust all eight members by
secretly eliminating their name tags.]

15
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,573
I smell the scent of betrayal.

16
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:59,655
There are a total of eight members including
RM cast members and Moon Chae Won.

17
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:03,213
You must oust all the members by secretly
eliminating their name tags in order to win.

18
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:04,711
I have to do that?

19
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:10,342
But as you already know, they're pros
when it comes to name tag elimination.

20
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:12,183
- Yes, they are.
- So...

21
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:17,352
- The help that you have requested...
- Ah... he is finally here.

22
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,890
[A special guest that Seung Gi
himself has requested!]

23
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:23,790
He is a very special guest, and it took
some effort to bring him on the show.

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,595
Yes, and he is finally here.
Please show him in.

25
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:31,418
[He is none other than...]

26
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,394
Why are there so many cameras?

27
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:41,489
[Nation's best grumbler, Lee Seo Jin.]

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,937
Seo Jin, you came.

29
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,660
[You came...]

30
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,059
Why are you so dressed up?

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,321
You're just going to have to
take it all off.

32
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,031
Come and have a seat.

33
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:53,024
I really didn't want to come.

34
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:57,552
[Starts to grumble from the moment
he steps onto the scene.]

35
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:00,887
I told them how much effort it took
for me to get you to come on the show.

36
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,969
[Mr. Grump's first-time
appearance on Running Man.]

37
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,774
- Did you sleep well?
- I drank too much last night.

38
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,948
You're going to run your hangover off.

39
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,088
- I have to run? You can run by yourself.
- Just a little.

40
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:17,712
I can't run.

41
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:20,919
This is the mission that we received.

42
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,886
We have to oust all eight members by
secretly eliminating their name tags.

43
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,400
You can rip off all the name tags.

44
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,636
[Mr. Grumpy doesn't want to
be bothered to do anything.]

45
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,878
Yes, I will rip off the name tags.

46
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,072
But I think we need to work
together as a team

47
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,500
to come up with a plan to
eliminate all their name tags.

48
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,760
I don't know. You take care of it.
We can't eliminate Jong Kook.

49
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:49,737
That's why we have to deceive Jong Kook
and eliminate him while you distract him.

50
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:52,800
- Just eliminate me first.
- No, we can't do that.

51
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,148
This is going to be hard enough as is,
so how am I to eliminate you?

52
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:00,610
There are seven Running Man members,
and Moon Chae Won, as well.

53
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,763
I'm going to give them an opening mission of
having to go around searching for a card.

54
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:09,405
That's when you'll have to covertly
go around and rip off all their name tags.

55
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:12,322
When you do, a special advantage
will be given to only the two of you.

56
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:17,086
But the name tags can only be eliminated
when the two of you are together.

57
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,516
Then I think you're going to have to
rip off some name tags yourself.

58
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,294
I'm about to start puking right now.

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,869
I can't rip them off.

60
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,980
I'm not going to do any of that.

61
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:31,423
If someone catches on to your plans
and asks if there's something going on

62
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:36,295
or if any of the other eight asks if
you're secretly trying to oust them...

63
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,799
then at that point, you fail your mission.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,552
Just any question of suspicion
would signal the failing of our mission?

65
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,933
- Yes.
- Then we're going to fail right away.

66
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:46,365
[Seriously, Seo Jin...]

67
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,670
[Grumbling and complaining when we
already know how hard you'll be working.]

68
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,275
I think we're going to have to individually
lure them away from the rest of the group.

69
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,668
I'll stay away on my own and you can
go around eliminating their name tags.

70
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,892
I'll bring them to where
you'll be waiting for us.

71
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,829
- Then I'll just stay away somewhere.
- Yes, that sounds good.

72
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,360
- Okay.
- Why do you look so smug about it?

73
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,074
- You look way too happy about it.
- You just said that we can't get caught.

74
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:12,233
- You can plan it however you'd like.
- We're going to need a plan.

75
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,939
[Struggling fumbling little brother,
and a lazy and grumpy older brother.]

76
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,334
[Will they be able to succeed their mission?]

77
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:21,540
[30 minutes later.]

78
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,983
The whole river is frozen over.

79
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:27,202
[Everyone gathers together for the opening
while Seo Jin remains in hiding.]

80
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:29,738
I went home and practically passed out.

81
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,888
- I don't remember a thing.
- Really?

82
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,330
That's the first time I lost my memories
when I haven't even had anything to drink.

83
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,721
- You blacked out?
- You don't remember anything?

84
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:40,542
- Did you get home okay last night?
- Yes.

85
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,911
- Yes.
- Wow, that sounded nice.

86
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:46,772
Did you hear how Chae Won sounded
when she answered that question?

87
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:48,236
[A breathless sounding answer.]

88
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,853
[While everyone's laughing and
chatting amongst themselves...]

89
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:00,638
[Even while saying he didn't want to bother,
Seo Jin's observing the scene from the lobby.]

90
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:07,546
[Working hard even while acting
like he doesn't care about his mission.]

91
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:10,274
In order to earn a special advantage,
you will be given your opening mission.

92
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,815
- Right away?
- Yes, right away.

93
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:16,030
You have to find all 15 pieces of the card
within the time limit that you're given

94
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,992
and complete the puzzle on the board.

95
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:20,524
[Find the pieces and complete
the puzzle board on time.]

96
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:25,728
There are a total of ten numbers, and
five other numerical symbols in the puzzle.

97
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,085
Therefore, there are a total
of 15 puzzle pieces.

98
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,095
- Then this is an individual mission?
- No, it's not.

99
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:35,269
- We have a time limit to adhere to.
- You have to find all the puzzle pieces.

100
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,141
What are you doing?

101
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,620
[Collateral damage.]

102
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,827
- Are you okay? Get out of the way!
- Chae Won, are you okay?

103
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:46,114
[They're only worried about Chae Won.]

104
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:49,514
- What are you doing?
- What were you thinking?

105
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,873
- You have to watch out for others.
- Chae Won, are you okay?

106
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:57,947
- But I heard Seo Jin was going to be a guest.
- I saw that on the news, too.

107
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,558
- I saw that on the news, too.
- I heard something about that, too.

108
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:06,925
- When will he be coming?
- Well... I did hear something about that.

109
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:09,099
- But I'm not sure when he'll be joining us.
- Me neither.

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,845
- He'll be joining you later on.
- Why?

111
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,638
- Why later?
- He's flying back from overseas right now.

112
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,967
- He's heading back from overseas?
- Today? He's flying back today?

113
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,400
- He's flying back today?
- Yes, from the airport.

114
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,927
- I heard he's flying into Incheon.
- So that's why we're here?

115
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,969
That must be the reason why
we're here in Incheon.

116
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,140
- He's coming later?
- Yes, later.

117
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,874
- Then it's just us for now?
- Can we get started?

118
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,982
- Yes, you can get started.
- Let's go!

119
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:37,364
[Off to start their mission with
the understanding Seo Jin will come later.]

120
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,058
The opening must already be over.

121
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:45,221
[Seo Jin is already hiding in the room
that he and Seung Gi have agreed upon.]

122
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,223
Why did I go down to the lobby
instead of watching them from up here?

123
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:50,517
[Carefully shuts all the curtains
while grumbling the whole time.]

124
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:55,916
- Is this a team mission?
- Yes, this is a team mission.

125
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,676
- We have to work together.
- I think it's us against the producers.

126
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:02,376
I'm really bad at finding
things like this.

127
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,682
[Seung Gi hangs back
to send Seo Jin a quick text.]

128
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:12,164
<i>[Seo Jin, I'll start bringing the members
one by one up to the room.]</i>

129
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,364
<i>[Okay, let's just finish this up
and go get something to eat.]</i>

130
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,118
[Is he nervous?]

131
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:24,994
- I found one! Here it is!
- Already? There it is.

132
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,264
[Blank Ji finds a number card
as soon as they start the mission.]

133
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,420
[Already?]

134
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,186
- That's what we're searching for?
- It's nine.

135
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,680
- That's what we're looking for.
- How did you find it so quickly?

136
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:38,338
[Seriously?
We haven't even gotten started yet.]

137
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,855
Wait for me.

138
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,694
[Stick the puzzle piece onto the board.]

139
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,366
- Where could they be?
- They're really easy to find, I think.

140
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,664
[All the members must be ousted
before all the puzzle pieces are found.]

141
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,964
- There's one.
- Another one?

142
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,621
That's awesome.

143
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:02,052
[Another one?]

144
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,676
We're finding them very quickly.

145
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,806
[This is not good...]

146
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,854
I'm sure it'll get tougher
towards the end.

147
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:13,390
Ugh, why are they finding them so quickly?
This is driving me crazy.

148
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:18,123
- Here's one!
- You found one?

149
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,023
Where?
You found another one?

150
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:24,016
- Here it is. It's under the bed.
- You found one?

151
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:30,732
- It's not as hard as I thought it would be.
- I found one pretty quickly.

152
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,918
[Seo Jin, what are we going to do?]

153
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,837
[Whatever, I don't care...]

154
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,057
- Seung Gi, have you found anything?
- No, I haven't found anything.

155
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,678
I've already checked these rooms.

156
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:55,540
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are searching through
the fourth floor where Seo Jin is hiding.]

157
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,556
- Kwang Soo, search over there.
- Okay.

158
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:01,504
[Jong Kook turns around to
go and search another floor.]

159
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:10,300
[Oh? If Jong Kook leaves...
then only Kwang Soo is left on this floor.]

160
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,209
[Just then, Seung Gi enters the room
where Seo Jin is waiting.]

161
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,266
- Oh, Seo Jin!
- Huh?

162
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,221
- Oh, Seo Jin!
- Huh?

163
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,069
Seo Jin's in here.

164
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,639
[Awkwardly lures Kwang Soo
into the room.]

165
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,114
- Seo Jin's in here.
- Hello, Seo Jin.

166
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,468
[Kwang Soo and Seo Jin meet.]

167
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,556
- Come in.
- Come in, Kwang Soo.

168
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,793
Come in, Kwang Soo.
This is awesome.

169
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,357
Why...

170
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,773
Have a seat.

171
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:50,807
[Remains so cool
after just having ousted him.]

172
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,907
- Have a seat.
- Sit down, Kwang Soo.

173
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,557
- What just happened?
- You haven't met him before, have you?

174
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:58,119
[Eliminate first, and greet later.]

175
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,111
They said we'll win something
if we rip off your name tag.

176
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:03,358
- Just sit down.
- Don't think about what just happened.

177
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:06,339
- Sit down and chat with him.
- Have a seat.

178
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,607
[Huh?]

179
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:12,696
[Seung Gi heads back out
to go and find his next target.]

180
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,277
- Just sit down.
- Weren't you at the airport?

181
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,695
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.

182
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:20,014
I got here a little while ago and
was told to rip off your name tags.

183
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:23,224
Help me rip off the others' name tags
when they walk in here.

184
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,641
- The two of you are spies?
- I think so, but I'm not really sure myself.

185
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:32,262
They're going to come in here one by one
as you sit there in that chair.

186
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:36,104
- Yes.
- And I just want you to help me oust them.

187
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:39,325
Then our puzzle completing mission
really doesn't mean anything?

188
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:42,158
I don't really have any interest in that,
so don't even ask me about it.

189
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,716
Don't ask me any questions
because I really don't even care.

190
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:47,740
[What an odd spy this man is...]

191
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:53,044
[Yes!
We've eliminated one person!]

192
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:58,030
[In the meantime, the puzzle board is
already halfway complete.]

193
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,519
[Seung Gi's newest target, Chae Won,
is lured onto the fourth floor.]

194
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,683
Chae Won, I'll check this side,
and you can check the other side.

195
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:10,657
Seung Gi, you have to find something.
You did well with your searching yesterday.

196
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:13,015
I'll check over on this side.
This door's locked.

197
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,909
[Oh?]

198
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,116
[That room is...]

199
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:25,010
[That's the room where
Grumpy Spy is hiding!]

200
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,657
What are you doing in here, Kwang Soo?

201
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:34,896
[Seung Gi follows in her footsteps.]

202
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:38,207
What are you doing?
Why are you ripping that off?

203
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,579
- I just had to do that.
- Wait, what was that all about?

204
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,532
[Kwang Soo suddenly breaks out
in fits of laughter.]

205
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,030
No, this is a name tag elimination game.

206
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:50,729
What? I'm just doing what we're told.
I don't know anything about what's going on.

207
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm just sitting around here.

208
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:56,582
You're really dense, aren't you?
I just saw what happened to you.

209
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:01,062
It took you about two full seconds to
finally register what Seung Gi did to you.

210
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,366
[It took Chae Won two full seconds to
realize what Seung Gi had done to her?]

211
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,138
What is your deal?

212
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:08,994
What's that supposed to mean?

213
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,468
- Seo Jin, I think you have to come with me.
- Why are you hiding in here?

214
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:15,759
[Luring in the members is too dangerous, and
it's time for Seo Jin to spring into action.]

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,326
- You won't get much airtime from here.
- I don't want any airtime on the show.

216
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,176
I have no desire to be on this show.

217
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:26,510
- We have to promote our movie.
- I'm just a special guest star.

218
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:28,987
Why would I need to promote
the movie?

219
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:32,178
- Ugh, seriously.
- You just make a special appearance?

220
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,204
Why would I need to promote your movie?

221
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:37,511
Seo Jin, please do this for me.

222
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,933
[Grumpy Spy is finally talked into
stepping outside of his comfy hotel room.]

223
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:47,027
[Chae Won checks to make sure
that Seo Jin and Seung Gi leave the room.]

224
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:50,800
- Seo Jin doesn't even know.
- That was so weird.

225
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,577
That was so weird.

226
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,538
[Huh?
What are these two talking about?]

227
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,664
Hey, did you see Seung Gi falling for it?

228
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:06,303
[Big-nose and Jae Suk are also
talking about Seung Gi...]

229
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,774
- Seung Gi's not good at this, either.
- He's really gullible.

230
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,738
- He is...
- Jae Suk!

231
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,115
Where are you?

232
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,302
[The plan succeeded and we're both ousted.]

233
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,663
[The members are exchanging
secret signs with each other.]

234
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:23,136
[It's time for us to get to work.]

235
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,152
[Just what is going on here?]

236
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,160
[Two hours prior.]

237
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:32,357
- Lee Seo Jin!
- I saw the news for it.

238
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:36,251
- We heard that Seo Jin will be coming.
- We saw the news.

239
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,485
Why is Chae Won here, and
not Seung Gi?

240
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,629
There's a reason why there are only
the eight of you here right now.

241
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,640
- We're getting someone?
- It's a 'Fool the guest' mission.

242
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:50,910
[Mission- Two against eight.
Fool the guests.]

243
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:57,891
Lee Seo Jin and Lee Seung Gi have been given
the mission to oust all eight of you.

244
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,918
- They'll be eliminating your name tags.
- How embarrassing for them.

245
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:03,575
I'm really good at acting surprised.

246
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,582
You have to act natural and
let them eliminate your name tags

247
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,172
and if they succeed in ousting all of you,
then you succeed your own secret mission.

248
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,960
Then what would result in us failing?

249
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:15,648
If they suspect of something odd
going on before you're all eliminated

250
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,697
or if either Lee Seo Jin or Lee Seung Gi
suspects there being a candid camera

251
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:21,740
- then you fail the mission.
- That's not going to happen.

252
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:26,055
Then we have to let them think that
they won by a real close call.

253
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,191
Chae Won, can you act really natural
if you get your name tag ripped off?

254
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:31,683
- Are you going to scream out or what?
- Let's practice doing it.

255
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:35,669
- Okay, I just ripped off your name tag.
- Okay, what are you going to do?

256
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,717
- You have to do something.
- Your name tag was ripped off a while ago.

257
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,525
Are you lacking any feeling in the back?

258
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:48,388
[Chae Won, the woman with the
senseless back.]

259
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:54,275
[Even during the actual event,
her reaction is one step behind.]

260
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:57,757
[This is the reason why Kwang Soo
burst out laughing.]

261
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,833
[Seriously, Chae Won!]

262
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:06,131
[But the oblivious Spy Brothers are just
happy about having eliminated her name tag.]

263
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:11,669
Where should I let them oust me
for them to feel like they actually got me?

264
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,782
[The members are pondering about how to
let themselves be ousted during the mission.]

265
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,469
Look at him acting weird.

266
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:26,634
[The members are having too much fun
watching Seung Gi getting flustered.]

267
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,638
[Our Seung Gi is so adorable.]

268
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,708
[And the Grumpy Brother finally takes
a step outside of his comfy room.]

269
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,118
[His gaze continues to dart around
even while pretending not to care.]

270
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:42,192
Okay.

271
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,022
Let's get this done.

272
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,941
Jae Suk just went up there
to get ousted.

273
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,344
I think we're going to get ousted
one at a time.

274
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,985
[Considerate enough to go in one at a time
to help out the awkward spies.]

275
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,657
Jae Suk just went up there.
We'll go one at a time.

276
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,239
[But Seung Gi still remains oblivious
and is ready for the face-off.]

277
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,174
I think this is the sauna.

278
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,742
- You've already checked out the sauna?
- Oh? It's Seo Jin.

279
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,813
- When did you get here?
- I got here this morning.

280
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:14,897
I heard you weren't coming
until the afternoon.

281
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,891
No, I'm not doing anything.

282
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:23,155
[A sudden acting performance.]

283
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,997
[Grumpy Brother rips off his
first ever name tag.]

284
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:34,329
I don't know why either,
but I was just told to do that.

285
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:40,031
- I thought we were looking for numbers.
- Numbers and this, too.

286
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,678
- I was just told to do what I did.
- Shouldn't you be cooking somewhere instead?

287
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:46,923
[This man has been quite busy
cooking for others lately.]

288
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,466
Yes, he and I are quite close.

289
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,776
[Be careful of how you say things!]

290
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,309
Why are you just hiding out in here
if you're the spy?

291
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,951
- You should be out and walking around.
- I don't like walking around.

292
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:01,236
I'm not very motivated.
I don't really want to do that.

293
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,072
[Seung Gi is still left struggling
because of his lack of motivation.]

294
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,866
- Am I ousted?
- Yes, you can just take a little rest.

295
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,842
Seriously, Seung Gi.

296
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,733
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

297
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,505
Seung Gi is so sloppy.

298
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,162
[The eight members are left to getting
themselves ousted by these Sloppy Brothers.]

299
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,459
What just happened?

300
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,889
[Nominated for Best Actor Award-
Ha Ha's act of shock.]

301
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:26,315
I've actually never met him before.
Hello.

302
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:30,184
[Nominated for Best Actor Award-
Big-nose's act of nonchalance.]

303
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:33,616
[Next up is Seo Jin's once
former co-star, Blank Ji.]

304
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,883
Hi, Ji Hyo.

305
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:39,212
- Why do you look so shocked?
- Seo Jin!

306
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,278
Sorry, Ji Hyo.

307
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,663
[Definitely a true actor.
What great act of shocked bewilderment.]

308
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,664
Ask him what's going on
because I don't know anything.

309
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,704
His character is like that
of a rich household's spoiled son.

310
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,795
He really hates to sweat,
and he really hates to be cold.

311
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:58,379
You know how most people feel guilty
if they're the only one warm and comfortable?

312
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,654
But he actually goes around
bragging about how warmly he's dressed.

313
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:04,906
That's what he goes around saying.
He acts like a brat.

314
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,325
If Seo Jin and Seung Gi
come around the corner

315
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:14,976
- we have to act like something's off.
- Jong Kook.

316
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,262
Yeah?

317
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,452
- Seo Jin's here.
- Seo Jin!

318
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,297
[Will the Sloppy Spy Brothers catch onto
the candid camera mission?]

319
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,292
- Seo Jin!
- Hello.

320
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:27,075
[Another awkward greeting time.]

321
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:30,360
I thought you weren't
going to come until later?

322
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:34,101
This is kind of sudden.
Jong Kook, I'm going to search upstairs.

323
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,081
Something about this feels off to me.

324
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,903
[Gary is being so obvious
about leaving the scene.]

325
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,697
[But Seung Gi doesn't even
catch on to Gary's awkwardness.]

326
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,063
Seo Jin's acting a little funny.
Don't you think so, Seung Gi?

327
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,527
[Kkuk pretends to be suspicious
of Seo Jin.]

328
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:50,841
- What are you saying is weird?
- The rest of the members are...

329
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,775
Hey!

330
00:18:54,266 --> 00:19:00,801
[A thriller to Seo Jin and Seung Gi only,
and it's a comedy to everyone else.]

331
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,106
It's not like I can stick my name tag
out for them to rip off.

332
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:06,737
[Gary is the only one left to eliminate!]

333
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:09,609
[Let's get him!]

334
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:15,162
[Seung Gi's suddenly getting excited,
and Gary goes along with the act.]

335
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,036
[And the Young Master who will not
break a sweat by running.]

336
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:23,271
[Will he be eliminated first,
or will they catch on first?]

337
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:26,601
- Why don't you say 'hi' to Seo Jin first?
- Wait, he's scaring me.

338
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,546
Why would you be scared of me?

339
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,751
- How about we shake hands?
- This is what Choi Min Soo was like, too.

340
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,796
- No, I'm not like that.
- Okay, we'll just shake hands.

341
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:38,821
[While they're shaking hands,
Seung Gi goes in for the kill.]

342
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:41,672
[Gary's realistic acting.]

343
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,436
Let's just go eat, okay?
Come on, it's all over now.

344
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:50,675
[Two against eight mission-
Successfully eliminates all the members.]

345
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:54,003
Seo Jin, did you just oust me
because you want to go and eat?

346
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:56,337
I just wanted to finish it
so that we can go and eat.

347
00:19:56,884 --> 00:20:00,679
- No one caught onto what we were doing.
- I was just searching for the pieces.

348
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,352
- You really didn't suspect anything?
- No, I didn't suspect a thing.

349
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,173
[This sloppy spy is so happy at being
complimented for his mission accomplished.]

350
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,229
[But, too bad...]

351
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:13,316
[Time to reveal the real truth
to the Spy Brothers.]

352
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:15,840
Seo Jin.

353
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:19,876
What was it that Seo Jin and
Seung Gi were doing?

354
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,500
I didn't feel comfortable
about what we were doing.

355
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:26,154
Here are the results
for your opening mission.

356
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,873
The opening mission results are...

357
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:31,216
'Two against eight- Fool the Guest Mission',
The eight members, wins!

358
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:33,621
[The eight members win the
opening mission!]

359
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,284
[Huh?]

360
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:45,592
[A celebratory atmosphere except
for the two Spy Brothers.]

361
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:47,943
[Unable to comprehend what's going on.]

362
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:50,194
- What's going on here?
- We just won.

363
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:53,200
Why? We eliminated everyone.
It was all candid camera?

364
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:57,348
[Amazing how they actually thought they had
fooled everyone with their awkward spy act.]

365
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:00,502
We had to let you eliminate us.
We had to let you think that you got us.

366
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,750
I was thinking that it was
all too easy.

367
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,948
What do you mean, it was easy?
You were getting beet red in the face.

368
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,973
[Had they been real spies, they would've
been caught within 5 seconds.]

369
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:11,598
- Seriously, I was so flustered.
- I didn't know what to do.

370
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,736
Do you see Seo Jin's expression?
It's like he doesn't even care.

371
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,073
[Seo Jin- 'What about it?']

372
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,394
[Who cares?]

373
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:21,667
He didn't really care about the mission,
and I was the only one feeling anxious.

374
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:24,603
I was feeling so anxious about
getting the mission accomplished.

375
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:28,455
- I know.
- We'll first announce the teams.

376
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:32,427
Seo Jin's really looking forward to lunch,
so we need to get the ball rolling.

377
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:35,117
[Announcement of lunch has
his two dimples showing.]

378
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,952
- Lee Seo Jin and Yoo Jae Suk.
- Us two?

379
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:40,981
Seo Jin and I are really close,
so I'm glad that we're a team.

380
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,257
- Look at that expression on his face.
- Seo Jin doesn't seem to agree with you.

381
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,711
[In reality, they haven't met
more than a few times in real life.]

382
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,253
[Seo Jin's pushing him away.]

383
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:53,223
[Grumpy Seo Jin is pushing
clingy Jae Suk away.]

384
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:59,183
- This is how you're supposed to do the show.
- No, don't do it.

385
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:07,201
Look at how he's sweating right now.

386
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:10,170
[Breaking out in a sheen of sweat
with Jae Suk's closeness.]

387
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,169
Maybe it's because he's happy about it.

388
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,430
Seo Jin's so awesome.

389
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:18,183
And Lee Seung Gi
and Moon Chae Won will be a team.

390
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:20,614
- Kim Jong Kook and Lee Kwang Soo.
- Yes!

391
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,556
Kwang Soo.

392
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,413
Get away from me!

393
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:28,680
[Not happy with what he's seeing.]

394
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,711
That kind of overreaction is
what Seo Jin hates the most.

395
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:33,381
I told you not to do things like that.

396
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,965
- Right? He drives me nuts with that.
- Why do you keep doing things like that?

397
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,222
I really can't stand that.

398
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,943
[Grumpiness, venomous words, grumbling=
An unprecedented character.]

399
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:48,783
- Ji Suk Jin and Ha Ha.
- What? Why would you do that to me?

400
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,596
What kind of a reaction is that?

401
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:55,693
And Gary and Song Ji Hyo
will make up the final team.

402
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,415
[Lastly, Gary and Ji Hyo.]

403
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,457
Okay, here are the rules of
today's mission.

404
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,072
It's a Couple Making Race.

405
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:05,138
Seo Jin, you really have to listen.

406
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,663
[Doing everything that Seo Jin
hates the most.]

407
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,959
- Then shall we all do it together?
- One, two, three.

408
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,301
[Everyone leans in to listen together.]

409
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:20,182
Stop doing things like that.

410
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:25,097
Okay, this is good.
I'm going to have fun with Seo Jin.

411
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,322
[Wait for their new bromance to come.]

412
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,020
- What's that?
- We have one for each couple.

413
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:31,661
[An adorable character bag
for each of the couples.]

414
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,728
- Will Seo Jin have to wear one, too?
- Wear it around your neck.

415
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:38,861
Come here, and put this around
your neck.

416
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,623
That looks even weirder.
Just wear it across your chest.

417
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,817
- I'll put it on later.
- It's a cross bag.

418
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,870
- Wear it messenger style.
- Just put it on now.

419
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,162
Just put it on around you.

420
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,536
Or let me put my arm around
your shoulders.

421
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,814
[A huge laughter for the audience.]

422
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,388
[Ugh, seriously!]

423
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:06,865
[Maintains his pride and
tucks it underneath his arm.]

424
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,498
- Do you remember the cards that you found?
- Yes.

425
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:14,608
A total of 15 cards consisting of ten numbers
and five numerical symbols.

426
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,471
There are two sets of the 15 cards
that you have found

427
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:21,690
totaling 30 cards, and they've been
divided out to three cards per person

428
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:25,215
which comes to six cards per team, and
they're randomly divided out to everyone.

429
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,037
- They're all mixed up.
- I can feel them in there.

430
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,354
The team that gets rid of those cards first
at the final mission site wins the race.

431
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:32,691
[First team to get rid of the cards
wins the entire race.]

432
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:34,826
Here's how you can get rid of the cards.

433
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:37,298
There are two of each card.

434
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:41,295
In order to get rid of your cards, you
have to swap them out with other teams

435
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:45,228
to get a matching pair
in order to get rid of them.

436
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,766
Only the teams that come in the
first three places during the missions

437
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:50,799
will get the chance to swap out
their cards with another team.

438
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,653
The more missions you win,
more chances you'll have to swap

439
00:24:53,654 --> 00:24:57,558
to make a pair of a certain number
or a symbol to get rid of them.

440
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:02,322
[The first team to make the pairs to
get rid of all the cards wins the race.]

441
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:11,992
[Under the bright winter sunlight,
they're off to their first mission site.]

442
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,919
You totally fooled me.

443
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:18,897
[Seung Gi was completely fooled
by Chae Won's great acting skills.]

444
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,114
- I was good, wasn't I?
- You were no joke.

445
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:25,273
Here they come.
Wave at them.

446
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,008
[Ha Ha and Suk Jin flag down
Jae Suk and Seo Jin's car.]

447
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,520
- What?
- I came up with a poem for Seo Jin.

448
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:35,145
- Just keep going.
- Let me hear it.

449
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:37,489
- Lee.
- Look here.

450
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,299
- Seo.
- Seo Jin.

451
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,432
- Jin.
- I really love you.

452
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,982
<i>I really love you.</i>

453
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:47,064
Go!
Just go!

454
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,063
[Feeling embarrassed.]

455
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:56,785
- He really hates it.
- Why does he hate it so much?

456
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:00,667
Seo Jin, do you want to do
one for Ha Ha?

457
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:04,537
- No, don't do things like that!
- We have to reciprocate their efforts.

458
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:07,441
[A rule of variety shows-
Return what you're given.]

459
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,423
Then just laugh out loud for me, okay?

460
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:14,159
Just do that for me, okay?
Just do that.

461
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:17,869
Okay, here we go.
We got them at the red light.

462
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,501
- Wait.
- What is it?

463
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:22,576
- Seo Jin and I've prepared something.
- What?

464
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:25,852
- A poem for you. Say your name.
- Ha.

465
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,401
Ha.

466
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:30,591
I said, stop it!

467
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:34,590
[An unexpected completion of a poem.]

468
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:41,983
[Intentional, or perhaps,
unintentional grumpy gag humor.]

469
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:45,784
- I can't believe that actually worked out.
- See?

470
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,744
[The bright winter sunlight
shines brightly off the winter ocean.]

471
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,430
There it is.
I have a good feeling about this.

472
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,518
Hurry, we have to run over there.

473
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,568
[What kind of a mission awaits
them by the ocean?]

474
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,754
- He's like a diamond in the rough.
- Why?

475
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:07,988
He complained nonstop the
whole way here.

476
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:11,344
[A grumpy variety show treasure.]

477
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:13,557
When I pointed out the beautiful ocean,
he complained about it being too bright.

478
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,871
[His grumpiness brings out
laughter from others.]

479
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:19,862
[First mission-
Piggyback ride for my love.]

480
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:21,792
- This is good.
- I've given you a piggyback ride before.

481
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,152
- It's okay.
- Sorry, Gary.

482
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,770
It's okay, you'll be giving Gary a ride.

483
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:29,038
One member from each team will
crawl under the net

484
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,250
and snatch the sack off the bar,
then over to their partner

485
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,916
and pull out a rubber shoe from the sack
to put it on their partner's foot.

486
00:27:35,951 --> 00:27:41,661
Then you'll run over to the white line
and stand in front of the basket.

487
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:48,265
Then the person riding the piggyback will
throw the rubber shoe into the basket to win.

488
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,736
First place winner will be excused
from playing in the next round.

489
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,145
[First place winner will be
excused from the next round.]

490
00:27:53,146 --> 00:27:56,321
- You can be excused from the next round.
- Then let's finish this at once.

491
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:58,735
- I think you'll be playing again.
- You can do the running.

492
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:00,211
- Me?
- Yeah.

493
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,355
Why do I have to?
We should play for it.

494
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:06,715
- What are you two talking about?
- What are you two mumbling about?

495
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:09,820
[Grumbler and the Grasshopper-
A lippy duo.]

496
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:14,656
[It seems as though Mr. Grumpy
will be sweating a bit himself.]

497
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,606
- He'll have to do it, too.
- Chae Won, let's start with you.

498
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,510
- You want me to give you a piggyback ride?
- No, I'm kidding.

499
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,505
[Piggyback ride for my love- Round One.]

500
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,836
[Piggy backers are getting ready
to give their partners a ride.]

501
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,044
[Everyone's looking relaxed and at ease.]

502
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:34,748
- Seung Gi, I've already got my shoes off.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

503
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:37,962
- Can someone cheer us on?
- Fighting!

504
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,138
- Kang Gary, fighting!
- Wait, and I'll come running to you, Seo Jin.

505
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,877
- What was that all about?
- Okay, fine.

506
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:47,678
- Lee!
- Look here.

507
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,590
- Seo!
- Seo Jin!

508
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:51,673
- Jin!
- I really love you!

509
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,586
[Turns around with a smile on his face.]

510
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:01,765
[Grasshopper's passionate declaration
of love for Mr. Grumpy.]

511
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,613
As mentioned before, the first place winner
will be excused from having to play again.

512
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,440
[First place winner will be excused from
having to play anymore rounds.]

513
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:14,645
- Ready!
- Sorry, sorry.

514
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,505
Set, go!

515
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,992
[Running full speed ahead.]

516
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,357
[Everyone arrives at the net
at the same time.]

517
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,156
[Their sense of urgency has them
crawling both under and over the net.]

518
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:34,591
[Getting their acts together to
go about it the right way.]

519
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,901
[Ha Ha moves full speed ahead.]

520
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,591
[Ha Ha's in the lead.]

521
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:45,622
[Jae Suk moves at a 90 degree angle.]

522
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:48,563
Where is he going?

523
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,725
[Ha Ha is first to get across the net.]

524
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:53,658
[Runs full speed ahead toward the sacks.]

525
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,583
[That's Jae Suk and Seo Jin's sack.]

526
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,210
That's not the one!

527
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,819
[The schemer we all know and love!
Throws it far off the course.]

528
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,713
[After eliminating Jae Suk and
Seo Jin's sack far off from the course...]

529
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:06,872
[Aims for his own team's sack.]

530
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,064
[But fails to grab his own sack.]

531
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,879
[Meanwhile, Jae Suk finishes
getting through the net.]

532
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,104
- Where did mine go?
- Seung Gi!

533
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:17,096
He threw it over there.
Over there.

534
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:18,573
Run, Seung Gi!

535
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:22,283
[Seung Gi gets through in third place.]

536
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:25,528
[Nice jump!
Gets the sack on his first try.]

537
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,915
[Seung Gi is suddenly in the lead.]

538
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:32,187

almost simultaneously.]

539
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:37,662
[Giraffe's natural instincts come out,
and throws Ha Ha and Suk Jin's sack away.]

540
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:40,626
You did great!
That was a good move!

541
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:43,054
[Seung Gi and Chae Won are in the lead
for the rubber shoe throw off course.]

542
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,749
[The partner on the back must make the goal
with the shoe in order to win the round.]

543
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:53,213
[Is the rubber shoe too heavy
for her slight foot?]

544
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,872
[The other four couples are
about to follow hot on their trail.]

545
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,342
Why is he so heavy?

546
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,850
[Mr. Grumpy looks to be having fun.]

547
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,375
[The area is suddenly busy with all
five couples making their attempts.]

548
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:15,467
[Let's just throw it and see what happens.]

549
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:18,629
[Seemingly uninterested, but
showing a fierce level of concentration.]

550
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,144
This is exhausting!

551
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:26,408
This is way too hard.

552
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,591
[The culprit in question, Lee Seo Jin.]

553
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:36,638
[Resorts to cheating when
his team isn't winning.]

554
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:40,304
[A fierce streak of competitiveness
behind the grumpiness.]

555
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,163
You're working really hard at this.

556
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,283
It looked like it was going to
make it in.

557
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:50,797
[Makes another attempt after
kicking away the other team's shoe.]

558
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:53,143
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are
also ready to take their aim.]

559
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,904
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
win the first round.]

560
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:15,133
[Kwang Soo and Jong Kook are excused
from playing in any further rounds.]

561
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:21,722
[Grumpy and the Grasshopper-
Arguing about who will give whom a ride.]

562
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,838
- You can't make the goal.
- I'm too exhausted.

563
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,997
Seo Jin, if we don't win it this time,
then you have to do it in the next round.

564
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,481
- Okay?
- Okay.

565
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:32,394
- Ugh, Lee Seo Jin.
- Yours was going to make it in.

566
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:35,252
- I was going to make it in.
- Yes, it looked like it was going to.

567
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,351
It was going to make it in.

568
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:40,208
It looked like you were going
to make it in.

569
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,124
[When words aren't enough,
add in some footwork.]

570
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,184
Ugh, seriously!

571
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:49,462
- Lets rest after this one, Gary!
- Win this, and I'll buy you dinner!

572
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:53,324
- Wait, and I'll come for you.
- Win this, and I'll buy you a house.

573
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:56,315
- Okay, deal!
- Seo Jin!

574
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:58,216
You should say something, too!

575
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,330
- Seriously...
- Just say something!

576
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:01,853
Do a good job.

577
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,400
Do a good job.

578
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:07,372
[A cheer from Mr. Grumpy.]

579
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,623
- He even said it twice!
- Yes, he said it twice!

580
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:12,137
- He said it twice, right?
- Get ready!

581
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:18,958
[Slides under the net.]

582
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,338
[Moving faster under the net.]

583
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:26,096
[Ha Ha's shocking spurt of speed again.]

584
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:31,734
[Ha Ha gets through at an alarming speed,
and the Grasshopper isn't far behind.]

585
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:34,207
Jae Suk was really fast, too.

586
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,528
Move!

587
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:46,161
[They all fail in succession.]

588
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:48,664
None of them can reach the sacks.

589
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:52,399
- They can't even reach it.
- You have to help each other.

590
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,490
[Ha Ha throws his shoe to knock it down.]

591
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,956
[Ha Ha's unbeatable scheming brain.]

592
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,410
Do a good job and I'll buy you
an apartment.

593
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,956
[Ha Ha's shoe comes speeding
through the air.]

594
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:05,298
[Just then, Gary jumps into the air
to snatch down his sack.]

595
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,115
[Jae Suk also gets his
with the help of his shoe.]

596
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,432
[Ha Ha also gets his
with the help of his own shoe.]

597
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:19,153
[Seung Gi finally takes off his own shoe
to attempt grabbing at his sack.]

598
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,606
[The shoe flies off into the stratosphere.]

599
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,254
[A true klutz in the works.]

600
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,514
[Makes a second attempt with
his other shoe.]

601
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,081
[Knocks the sack up even higher.]

602
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,580
Ugh, I'm going to lose it.

603
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,646
Hang on, Chae Won.

604
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,193
[Jumps into the air with
both the shoes in his hands.]

605
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:50,583
[The never-ending battle with the sack.]

606
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,728
[Ji Hyo and Gary arrive first
to throw off the rubber shoe.]

607
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,326
[Carefully takes aim...]

608
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,684
[Bounces off the basket and misses!]

609
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:13,382
You have to kick it off with some force.

610
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,656
Let me do that again.

611
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:22,376
[Gary and Ji Hyo's second attempt.]

612
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,843
[Second round- Gary and Ji Hyo win.]

613
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:34,363
They made it in.

614
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:37,391
[The remaining couples
are depleted of their energy.]

615
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:40,559
[Ji Hyo and Gary are also exempt
from participating in the next round.]

616
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:44,342
[Clumsy Seung Gi runs out of battery.]

617
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,274
- Seung Gi, you didn't even get started.
- What are you doing?

618
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:50,671
Sorry, Chae Won.
I don't even know what to say.

619
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:52,838
I can't believe that even
Ha Ha beat me.

620
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,002
Seo Jin.

621
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:59,441
You saw how I did it, right?
You just need to do it like that.

622
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:03,157
Do it just this once.
I promise that I'll make it in.

623
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:05,610
- We'll get it for sure this time.
- No.

624
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,682
- Just do it.
- We have to do it again?

625
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:10,490
- Come on, just do it.
- Let's just go!

626
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:12,891
- Where are you going?
- Seo Jin, where are you going?

627
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,595
Come on, just do it.

628
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:16,374
What are you doing?

629
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,519
I told you not to do stuff like that!

630
00:36:19,145 --> 00:36:22,132
[The more tired he becomes,
the grumpier he gets.]

631
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,134
Hurry up, Seo Jin.
Just go.

632
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,721
What's he doing?

633
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:36,236
- Why are you walking around like a drunk?
- Lee Seo Jin is pissing me off!

634
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:40,231
[Grasshopper finally explodes from
all of Seo Jin's grumbling.]

635
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,567
Tell Lee Seo Jin to come out here!

636
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:46,614
[It seems as though he's quite stressed
from all of Lee Seo Jin's antics.]

637
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:51,126
[His fire isn't very easily flamed out.]

638
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,506
- Ugh, Lee Seo Jin!
- Just keep drinking!

639
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:58,146
Ugh, Lee Seo Jin! Who asked
Lee Seo Jin to come on the show?

640
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:05,285
[Piggyback ride for my love- Round Three.]

641
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:09,529
This is just ridiculous!
I just can't lose to these two!

642
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,377
- Seung Gi's really bad at these games.
- He's really bad.

643
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:15,415
- He's really bad.
- Want me to show you for real this time?

644
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,199
- Yeah, show it to me for real this time.
- I'm doing it for real this time.

645
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,183
[Please do it for real this time...]

646
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,294
Seung Jin... I mean, what am I saying?

647
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,722
[Seung Gi and Seo Jin= Seung Jin?]

648
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,653
All I'm even thinking about
in my head is Lee Seo Jin!

649
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,497
[A hand behind his back and a lazy stance-
His own way of being ready.]

650
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:35,635
- Can you please get ready?
- This is me getting ready!

651
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:39,114
[Grumpy is ready to go.]

652
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:42,033
- Who's ready to go like that?
- You're making us look weird.

653
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:43,921
[Please get ready like a normal person.]

654
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:46,677
- This is how you get ready.
- Can't you stand like this?

655
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:50,906
[Can't win against all the argument,
so steps one foot slightly forward.]

656
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:52,648
Satisfied?

657
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:55,270
- Ready!
- I don't think I've seen Seo Jin run before.

658
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,982
Set...

659
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:02,678
What are you doing!

660
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:05,817
- What are you doing!
- No, do it over!

661
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:08,264
[One man's sexy catwalk.]

662
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:12,320
[First ever net crawling
in Lee Seo Jin's variety career.]

663
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,574
- What is that?
- What is he doing?

664
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:18,673
- What is he doing?
- Look at Lee Seung Gi.

665
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:22,622
Look at what Seung Gi's doing.

666
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:25,006
[Young Seung Gi in his twenties
is first to get through the net.]

667
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,102
[A 27 year old's spurt of speed.]

668
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,072
[Pulls down the sack with just a single try.]

669
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,752
[The 40 year olds are still
struggling to get through.]

670
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:40,072
[Working hard even with all his grumbling.]

671
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,706
- What is he doing?
- What is Seo Jin doing?

672
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,944
[Meanwhile, Seung Gi and Chae Won
are ready for the rubber shoe course.]

673
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:50,591
[Grumpy finally manages
to get through the net.]

674
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:55,832
[Even in the midst of all his activities,
he still manages to obstruct Suk Jin.]

675
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:04,962
[Forcefully spikes down the sack.]

676
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,762
- He's the only one jogging.
- This isn't the beach in Miami!

677
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:15,918
[What a sad human being...]

678
00:39:16,864 --> 00:39:18,348
[The Grasshopper finally hops
onto Grump's back.]

679
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,725
Okay, I'm going to make this in.
Step forward a bit.

680
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:36,588
He almost just swore at me.
Seo Jin was about to swear at me.

681
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:38,259
Seo Jin almost just swore at me.

682
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,947
[The couple in their twenties
takes their aim.]

683
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:43,544
Seo Jin almost swore at me.

684
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:49,441
[Seung Gi and Chae Won win
the third round.]

685
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,407
Seo Jin was about to swear at me.

686
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:54,221
What the heck?

687
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,859
What was that?

688
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:00,912
Wait... how did you get that
done already?

689
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,622
- Seo Jin, what is your deal?
- Let's just go now.

690
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:09,186
[Sorry to tell you this,
but this is only just the beginning.]

691
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:14,082
[Time for the card swap.]

692
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,816
Everyone has three cards each,
which is six cards per team.

693
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:23,822
Second and third place winners can choose
one couple to swap out their card with.

694
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:25,973
[Second and third place winners can swap out
their card with any one of the couples.]

695
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:31,204
[The first place winner can swap out two
of their cards with any couple they choose.]

696
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:34,155
Take a look at the six cards
that you have amongst your team.

697
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:37,863
Choose and decide which card you'd like
to swap out with which team.

698
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,142
The first place winner has
the best advantage.

699
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:43,888
Why would you take one of ours?
Why not take someone else's card?

700
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:47,804
Do you guys know which
cards we have?

701
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,305
- No, I don't know what you have.
- Let's just make it quick and go home.

702
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:53,733
[Grumpy starts his grumbling since
he doesn't have a chance to make a swap.]

703
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:56,495
- This is the fun of it!
- It was a close call for you, too.

704
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,766
[There are more games to be played.]

705
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,619
I'm just saying that we should go.

706
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:02,744
No, he's right.

707
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,518
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo makes
a swap with Seung Gi and Chae Won.]

708
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,739
- We choose just one card?
- I'm going to take this one.

709
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:12,763
You have to give us one in exchange.

710
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,697
Give it to us with the card facing down.

711
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:22,749
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
already have a match.]

712
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:26,439
- They already have a pair.
- Let's take one of theirs.

713
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,607
- They have a matching pair.
- We're going to swap with them.

714
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:31,281
[Ji Hyo and Gary also choose to
swap with Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.]

715
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,242
[Unhappy with their excitement,
first place winners are being targeted.]

716
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,836
We don't like how happy you are.

717
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,034
Ji Hyo's good at choosing things like this.

718
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,244
- Why are there only four cards?
- What are you doing?

719
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:45,688
[Giraffe is caught
trying to pull a fast one.]

720
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:47,671
Kwang Soo, let's make it quick, okay?

721
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,168
I'm sorry, I'll make it quick.

722
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:54,927
Seo Jin has to go and cook.
He doesn't have much time.

723
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:58,657
He's pressing down really hard
with his right thumb.

724
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:00,739
I think he's doing that on purpose.

725
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:09,179
[Their matching pair is still left intact.]

726
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:18,441
[Embraces each other whenever
they look at their cards.]

727
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:23,467
[First place winner has two chances
to swap out their cards.]

728
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,611
- We're going to choose one from Seo Jin.
- Good.

729
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,675
Seo Jin, you have to pull out your cards.

730
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,056
Yes, you can take it.

731
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,343
- We're going to look.
- We're going to look at it.

732
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:43,385
[Gets a matching pair.]

733
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,607
[What luck is this!]

734
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:51,265
[Okay... I got it, so get away from me.]

735
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,323
He seems happy about something.
Look at how big he's smiling.

736
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,521
- Yes, he's happy.
- Did we give them a pair?

737
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:01,081
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo choose to
swap again with Seo Jin and Jae Suk.]

738
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:03,611
What are you going to do?
Just hurry up and do it.

739
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,285
- Make sure not to take ours back.
- Just hurry up and do it.

740
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:19,451
[The start of real mental battle.]

741
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:23,286
[Who will be the ultimate winner
of this mental battle?]

742
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:27,739
We have a matching pair right now.

743
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,487
We lost a matching pair,
but we gained another one in its place.

744
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:34,966
We're going to have to be careful about not
looking too excited when we get a pair.

745
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:39,162
It doesn't really matter to me
even when we do get a matching pair.

746
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:42,910
- Yes, I've noticed that.
- I don't really care to win that much.

747
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,960
I think that's what confuses
the other teams.

748
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:50,776
Because just like you said, you don't
really get all that excited about it.

749
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:54,961
You just wait and see.
We're going to end up winning this thing.

750
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:59,004
Just pick whichever card.
What's all the fuss about?

751
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,385
That's because of Kim Jong Kook.

752
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:08,381
And Jae Suk's team has the seven.

753
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:12,503
Because Jae Suk and Seo Jin got
really excited when we gave them our seven.

754
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:15,233
- But we took back our seven.
- Yes, then they have the seven.

755
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:17,249
[Jae Suk and Seo Jin's excitement over
the seven shows they have the other one.]

756
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:23,322
Why isn't Suk Jin in the car?
Suk Jin wasn't in the car with Ha Ha.

757
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,417
I wonder if he's sleeping in the back.

758
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:28,436
No, there's no way he
could be asleep.

759
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,056
[Yes, that's a very likely possibility.]

760
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,188
This is the place.

761
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:38,696
Seo Jin and I make a really good pair.
We're like real brothers.

762
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:44,744
There's something enigmatic about him.
There's an unknown charm about him.

763
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:46,533
Hey, Song Ji Hyo.

764
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:51,408
Seo Jin told me that you threatened to
poke his dimples through his face?

765
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:55,807
- When did I ever say that?
- He told me that's what you said to him.

766
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:58,039
- Do you really want me to spill your secret?
- What?

767
00:44:58,577 --> 00:45:02,350
- Go on and tell us.
- You're the one with secrets, not me.

768
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,979
That's why you're not spilling, isn't it?

769
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,992
Seo Jin is...

770
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:10,185
[Only one sitting down while
everyone else is standing.]

771
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:14,503
[Seo Jin looks more like someone
who's just here to watch the filming of RM.]

772
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,567
Seo Jin, I saw that
your niece is here outside.

773
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:19,925
- You have to look towards the camera.
- You won't get much airtime like that.

774
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:23,878
- No, it's better that I don't.
- Wait, I'll go and get her.

775
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:27,458
[Yoo Hyuk leaves the room
to get Seo Jin's niece.]

776
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:31,901
Ellie.
Why don't you come with me?

777
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:34,207
- You can watch from the inside.
- Really?

778
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,857
[Seo Jin's niece and his sister.]

779
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,709
- Ellie, tell your uncle to work hard, okay?
- She's so pretty.

780
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:46,875
[Ellie is an avid fan of Kwang Soo's, and
it's been her wish to visit the set of RM.]

781
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,269
Ellie, can you say something
to your uncle?

782
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,227
Tell him to work hard.

783
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:53,202
[An obvious fool over his niece.]

784
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:57,039
[On the set of Running Man
with Uncle Seo Jin.]

785
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,897
Ellie, keep watching and see how
hard your uncle's working here on set.

786
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:02,156
- She's so cute.
- I'm not working very hard.

787
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:05,838
[Will he work harder now
that his niece is watching?]

788
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,468
Your next mission is,
'Lovey-Dovey Back hug.'

789
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:14,597
You will randomly choose one of
the fifteen items that are set behind you.

790
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:18,241
All the items are numbered and
while one hugs his partner from the back

791
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,557
the couple will then proceed to move
the items with a pair of long chopsticks.

792
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:24,046
You can succeed by moving all five items
within the time limit that you're given.

793
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,741
- Yes, you'll be given one minute.
- Not just one, but five items?

794
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,782
- You can succeed in one try.
- Really?

795
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,327
Please bring out the chopsticks.

796
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:32,892
[Time to bring out the chopsticks.]

797
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:37,909
[The giant chopsticks are longer
than an average person's height.]

798
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,462
- Why don't we have Seo Jin try it out?
- Seo Jin, give it a try.

799
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:44,631
- Stop just sitting around.
- It's time to spit out blood.

800
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:48,226
We have to pick the items?
Pick something.

801
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:49,876
[The items that they randomly choose
will play a key role in their success.]

802
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:52,257
[What did Seo Jin choose?]

803
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:55,903
A shower stool?
Okay, that's not bad.

804
00:46:55,904 --> 00:46:58,634
[A light and easy to grab shower stool.]

805
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:01,701
- You're going to have to help me with this.
- Should I take my jacket off?

806
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:04,899
What got into you?
I can't believe you're taking off your jacket.

807
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,518
[For the first time ever,
Seo Jin shows some initiative.]

808
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,728
- I guess you're trying to work harder?
- You want to do a good job, don't you?

809
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,608
It's done in the method as described,
and if by a chance...

810
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:16,283
[The picture they draw
elicits some laughter.]

811
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:18,700
- You guys look like a couple.
- It's as if you are one.

812
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:20,615
We look pretty good, don't we?

813
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:23,575
Seo Jin and I are close enough
to be brothers by now.

814
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:26,485
Seo Jin has a pretty big stomach.

815
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,892
- Maybe I'm seeing things wrong.
- Seo Jin works out.

816
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:36,740
- You have to move one every ten seconds.
- This is a shoo-in.

817
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:39,155
[If they win this,
then they'll win first place.]

818
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,857
- That's too easy.
- How are you going to grab this?

819
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,579
Are you going to grab it like this
or grab it from the side?

820
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,995
[From top to bottom, or from the side?]

821
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:47,785
[Plan is to grab it from the side.]

822
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:49,481
Ready, set, go!

823
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:51,751
[Lovey-Dovey Back hug.
Round one.]

824
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:56,242
[They got it!]

825
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:03,372
[Fails again.]

826
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:06,793
[Totally focused.]

827
00:48:06,794 --> 00:48:10,411
- Look at his dimples.
- He's gritting down on his teeth.

828
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:14,423
He's having fun.
He's liking this game.

829
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,865
[Mr. Grumpy is into this game.]

830
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,185
[Good luck, Uncle!]

831
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,814
[Finally gets a firm grasp!]

832
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:28,310
- What are you doing, Seo Jin?
- Grab it from front to back!

833
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:33,627
[This time... throws it off to the side.]

834
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:37,535
- Seriously.
- He's like a little kid playing.

835
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:39,911
Seo Jin, what are you doing?

836
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:43,661
[The clock keeps on ticking...]

837
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:46,215
Come on, seriously!
Okay, we've got this one.

838
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:50,539
[Barely manages to get their first one.]

839
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:55,279
[New plan- drag it over to the table.]

840
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,458
[Now they just need to
lift it onto the table.]

841
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:01,531
This is a really aggravating game.

842
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:04,698
[Jae Suk and Seo Jin fail the mission.]

843
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:08,061
This is impossible.

844
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:10,012
[Ugh, that's too bad.]

845
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,839
They were too rough with the stools.

846
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:16,491
[Second couple- Ha Ha and Suk Jin.]

847
00:49:16,492 --> 00:49:18,779
Suk Jin, we really can't lose this one, too.

848
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,893
- Please, Suk Jin.
- Okay!

849
00:49:20,894 --> 00:49:25,279
[Suk Jin's random draw- Lipstick.]

850
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,605
- Ping pong ball!
- No, it's lipstick.

851
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:31,109
[Mr. Grumpy looks very enthused.]

852
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,787
[And Seung Gi seems just as enthused.]

853
00:49:33,788 --> 00:49:36,071
- They got lipstick as their item.
- I guess we'll get our chance next week.

854
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,018
I guess this week isn't it.

855
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,289
- Our win will come next week.
- Big nose is flustered.

856
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,495
I think Seo Jin's having fun now.
He keeps smiling nonstop.

857
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:50,771
I can hear him laughing
nonstop next to me.

858
00:49:50,772 --> 00:49:53,237
He really likes the lipstick option
that you pulled.

859
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:56,173
[Finally seems to be getting into the game.]

860
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:59,007
Suk Jin, we just need to
grab it from the bottom.

861
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:01,942
- Grab it from the bottom.
- Ready!

862
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:04,890
Big-nose can't do this.
Big-nose won't be able to do this.

863
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,270
No, I can't do this.

864
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:12,710
- Big-nose can't do this.
- I thought I could, but I can't.

865
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:16,071
[Oh, they got it!]

866
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,285
I failed it as I thought I would.

867
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:24,263
[Forcing back down his laughter.]

868
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:26,805
- You have to really bend down.
- I think I got this one.

869
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:28,842
Okay, take it slow.

870
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,777
[Oh, no... so close!]

871
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:36,140
- It's all over now.
- Big nose is annoyed.

872
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:40,190
Big-nose is annoyed,
but continuing to try is Big-nose's style.

873
00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:50,404
[My name is Big-nose,
and giving up is not in my vocabulary.]

874
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:56,016
[Persistent Big-nose finally succeeds
in getting one on the table.]

875
00:50:56,017 --> 00:51:00,296
- That was awesome!
- Big nose!

876
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,104
I'm the figure of hope
for all men in their forties!

877
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:08,320
[Forties figure of hope, Big-nose.
Two lipsticks on the table!]

878
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:11,654
Never giving up is the most important thing.

879
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:16,155
[He grabs another one!]

880
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:19,365
[Big-nose's miracle!]

881
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:28,181
This is Big-nose's time!

882
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:29,661
[With one falling on the ground,
only two are left on the table.]

883
00:51:31,013 --> 00:51:33,325
[And successfully gets the third one
up on the table.]

884
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,782
One fell off the table.

885
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:41,536
[Succeeds in getting four,
but one fell off the table earlier.]

886
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:43,581
- You have to pick the other one back one.
- Big nose is going to succeed.

887
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:46,094
I like Big-nose's persistence.

888
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:50,170
[Persistent Big-nose successfully
gets all five on the table.]

889
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:55,323
- You succeeded.
- But you failed at minute and 50 seconds.

890
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,052
[Fails the mission by going
over the time.]

891
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,411
[Mr. Big-nose is the best!]

892
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,452
Big-nose, my butt.

893
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:09,967
He just said, 'Big-nose, my butt.'

894
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:18,644
[Can't contain his words any longer,
and lets them slip out past his tongue.]

895
00:52:19,038 --> 00:52:21,663
I can't believe he just said that.

896
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,811
[But kudos to Big-nose's persistence.]

897
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,484
[Seung Gi and Chae Won's turn to draw.]

898
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:28,914
[Yogurt]

899
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,137
- Did you get the shoelace?
- No, it's the yogurt.

900
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:37,604
Yogurt?

901
00:52:37,605 --> 00:52:41,319
[Will they be able to pick up and
move the small yogurt bottles?]

902
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,346
- Ready...
- Do you want to do this?

903
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:45,800
- No, you can do it.
- No, you do it.

904
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:49,477
- You can do it.
- I think Seung Gi will be awful at it.

905
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:54,430
[Self-proclaimed klutz.]

906
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:57,448
- I think we're going to be about the same.
- Why don't you try it?

907
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:59,620
You're not going to ruin
this opportunity, are you?

908
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:02,380
[Seung Gi and Chae Won- Start.]

909
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,746
Seung Gi's doing it.

910
00:53:06,747 --> 00:53:11,282
[Carefully picks up and moves the bottle.]

911
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:14,923
- There's a little nook for him to grab.
- What just happened?

912
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,604
[Chae Won's slapstick comedy attempt.]

913
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:27,448
- You knocked Chae Won down!
- No, keep going.

914
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:30,279
No, you can keep going.
I did that on purpose.

915
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,612
- I did that on purpose.
- You have to hold on.

916
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,101
Time out.

917
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:41,096
What's wrong, Chae Won?

918
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:43,614
[Chae Won's repeated slapstick comedy.]

919
00:53:44,803 --> 00:53:47,644
You can do it.
You can do it.

920
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:50,823
[After only two weeks on Running Man,
Chae Won shows promise in the variety world.]

921
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,935
She's like the drunk master.

922
00:53:55,454 --> 00:53:58,370
[Starts over with Chae Won now in front.]

923
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:01,166
We have to stand this one back up.

924
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:09,441
[Chae Won easily succeeds
with the first bottle.]

925
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:15,636
[But flips the next one,
and knocks the next one over.]

926
00:54:16,674 --> 00:54:18,933
Think about Big-nosed Brother
and don't give up.

927
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:21,008
Remember Big-nose's mentality.

928
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:24,262
Seung Gi, Seo Jin says
you can't be doing that.

929
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,848
[Drops it right in front of the table.]

930
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,132
[Seung Gi and Chae Won fail.]

931
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,988
[Ugh, this isn't easy.]

932
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,320
[Jong Kook, Kwang Soo and Gary, Ji Hyo
also fail at their first attempt.]

933
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,190
Please let it be the stuffed animal.

934
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:52,032
The metal pot!

935
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:55,237
- That's going to be easy.
- The pots have handles.

936
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,956
- You can go up front.
- Okay, I'll go up front.

937
00:54:57,652 --> 00:55:00,397
[Pots are easier to move due to
their lightness and easy to grab handles.]

938
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,100
Ready.

939
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:05,244
[Is Mr. Grumpy nervous
with his niece watching?]

940
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:08,429
[Jae Suk and Seo Jin's second attempt.]

941
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:14,504
[A steady grasp under the handles.]

942
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:17,648
See?
They got it under the handles.

943
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:22,879
[Easily succeeds in moving their first pot.]

944
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,870
Seo Jin, isn't this fun?

945
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,880
Seo Jin's having fun.

946
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:30,870
Look at how Seo Jin's
shoulders have narrowed.

947
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:34,002
Seo Jin's shoulders have narrowed
because he's actually trying.

948
00:55:34,003 --> 00:55:35,441
[Transforms his stance for the win.]

949
00:55:35,442 --> 00:55:37,515
[Stares at the pot
as if he's ready to gobble it up.]

950
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,030
[Succeeds with their second
pot with Seo Jin's efforts.]

951
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,168
[40 seconds left on the clock.
At this speed, they just might succeed!]

952
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,662
Look at how focused he is!
He's not even blinking his eyes.

953
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,006
He's taking one tiny step at a time.

954
00:55:58,007 --> 00:55:59,655
[Moves the third one successfully.]

955
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:04,101
[Cheating Kwang Soo steps behind Seo Jin.]

956
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:13,337
They've got less than 20 seconds left.

957
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:16,957
[Works around Kwang Soo's interference
to successfully move the pot.]

958
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:19,691
This isn't good.

959
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:23,198
[Five seconds left on the clock
with only one left to go.]

960
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,857
[If they succeed, then they win the chance
to swap out two of their cards.]

961
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,032
[Lovey-Dovey Back hug.
Succeeds the mission.]

962
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:37,294
[They did it!]

963
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:42,984

1124
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,854
I'll see you later.

1125
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,202
Before we start the final mission,
we will get the final tally of the cards.

1126
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:10,445
If you currently have a matching pair
in the stack of cards that you have

1127
01:06:10,446 --> 01:06:14,242
set down the matching pair on the tray
as you shout out the word, 'clear'

1128
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:15,926
to eliminate those cards from your stack.

1129
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,352
- Must we really shout that out?
- Are they serious?

1130
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:22,476
Can you please edit that part?

1131
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:25,313
What's going to happen now?
Is something going to explode?

1132
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,867
So I can prepare
an appropriate reaction for it.

1133
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:31,301
[After five years of being on RM,
Giraffe now even requests for CG effects.]

1134
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:35,648
[Jae Suk and Seo Jin currently have
two matching pairs.]

1135
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:38,207
Throw the pairs on the tray
as you shout out the word, 'Clear'.

1136
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,455
[I have to shout that out?]

1137
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:45,550
Okay, multiplication symbol, clear!

1138
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:46,834
[Jae Suk shouts out the first clear remark.]

1139
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:49,306
- What do I shout out?
- I have to shout out, 'Clear'?

1140
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:51,793
Equal, clear.

1141
01:06:52,297 --> 01:06:54,120
Can't you be more
cool about it as you say it?

1142
01:06:54,121 --> 01:06:57,575
- Why are they making us do this?
- Can you put more emphasis on it?

1143
01:06:57,576 --> 01:07:00,410
- They'll going to add in a CG effect.
- What's that?

1144
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:03,461
- Why would they add in a CG effect for this?
- Okay, equal symbol, clear.

1145
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:06,715
The card bounced off the tray.

1146
01:07:08,056 --> 01:07:10,839
[Here's an example of how it should be done.]

1147
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,822
Clear!

1148
01:07:12,823 --> 01:07:16,282
Wait, where did it go?

1149
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:21,670
[Masters of CG effect reaction acting.]

1150
01:07:24,227 --> 01:07:27,702
[Kkuk's overreaction to the effects.]

1151
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:30,602
Okay, clear.

1152
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:31,873
[Seung Gi and Chae Won sweetly
clear the matching pair of two's.]

1153
01:07:31,874 --> 01:07:34,204
If you have a matching pair of cards...

1154
01:07:34,772 --> 01:07:37,734
- We don't.
- Okay, sorry about that.

1155
01:07:37,769 --> 01:07:40,463
- Do you have any matching pairs?
- No, we don't.

1156
01:07:40,464 --> 01:07:43,199
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha don't have
any matching pairs either.]

1157
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:49,720
[The remaining cards are attached under
their name tags as little number tags.]

1158
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:57,302
[This is... how the final
mission will be carried out.]

1159
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:03,191
Here's your final mission.

1160
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:07,031
Your final mission is...
'Card elimination.'

1161
01:08:07,032 --> 01:08:10,729
- Card elimination.
- Why is he being so dramatic over nothing?

1162
01:08:12,132 --> 01:08:15,154
If you rip off the number or symbol card
from the back of another player

1163
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:16,843
then the player missing the card
will be frozen on the card.

1164
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:24,264
At which point, you can give one of the cards
from your back to the frozen player.

1165
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:25,710
[Give an unwanted card to the frozen player.]

1166
01:08:25,711 --> 01:08:32,531
[Pull off the card you want,
and hand off the card that you don't want.]

1167
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:37,706
Once you find a match to your own card,
lay down the pair on the 'R' marked tray

1168
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:41,884
and you must shout out the number
and the word, 'clear', for it to be valid.

1169
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:46,650
The first couple to get rid of all the cards
will be the ultimate winners of the race.

1170
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:50,130
- We just have to get the cards.
- This is very simple.

1171
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:54,671
Then I just get the number we need
and get rid of the other to win the race.

1172
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:58,232
We have the biggest advantage right now
because we already had two matching pairs.

1173
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,733
We will now start the final mission.

1174
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:03,210
Go!

1175
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:07,320
We should stick together.

1176
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,971
- Hey, Seung Gi!
- Oh my, you startled me.

1177
01:09:13,972 --> 01:09:16,825
[Both teams each have the number, six.]

1178
01:09:16,826 --> 01:09:20,330
[Checking to see if they have any cards
that their own team needs.]

1179
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:21,951
We need to see if you have
anything that we need.

1180
01:09:21,952 --> 01:09:25,672
[Running around in circles
to see what they have.]

1181
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:30,237
- You can't try cornering us like this.
- Gary... Gary... he has something.

1182
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:35,313
[Chae Won mistakes the nine
Gary has on his back for a six.]

1183
01:09:35,314 --> 01:09:36,656
No, you saw it wrong.

1184
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:39,721
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo has the seven.

1185
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:42,155
- Really?
- Come here.

1186
01:09:42,156 --> 01:09:43,728
Come here, Chae Won.

1187
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,949
[Splits up.]

1188
01:09:47,506 --> 01:09:51,590
[Seo Jin keeps his bottom
firmly planted on his seat.]

1189
01:09:54,586 --> 01:09:56,332
Jong Kook!
Just end it now!

1190
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:58,102
Gary!

1191
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,829
[Everyone's ganging up on Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1192
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,490
- Ji Hyo.
- Why are you doing this?

1193
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:07,244
- Do I have something that you need?
- I don't know, I didn't get to see.

1194
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:10,936
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't get to see.

1195
01:10:10,937 --> 01:10:13,808
- Get away from me! Go away!
- Look at the numbers on my back.

1196
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,850
- You don't have anything we need.
- Let me take a look at what you have.

1197
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:18,652
I don't have anything.

1198
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:22,093
[Seung Gi sneaks up behind Ji Hyo
to snatch her six.]

1199
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:26,591
[Attacks while Ji Hyo's
distracted by Chae Won.]

1200
01:10:30,637 --> 01:10:32,833
[Kkuk gets the three he needs
from Seung Gi.]

1201
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:36,644
[And dumps one that
he doesn't needs on Seung Gi.]

1202
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:39,297
Clear!

1203
01:10:44,194 --> 01:10:46,569
You need to work out more so that
you don't get knocked down like that.

1204
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,970
- I was just so startled.
- I know.

1205
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:50,040
Yoo Jae Suk.

1206
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:53,375
There he is.
He's in the bathroom.

1207
01:10:53,376 --> 01:10:54,909
There he is!

1208
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:01,626
[They both need the Five.]

1209
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:08,787
[Yoo Hyuk is left to defend himself
while Mr. Grumpy takes a break.]

1210
01:11:10,661 --> 01:11:11,916
We have to get the Five.

1211
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,734
We have to get the Five away from him.

1212
01:11:14,696 --> 01:11:16,373
[He got the Five in his hand!]

1213
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:19,481
[But Yoo Hyuk maintains
his defensive position.]

1214
01:11:19,482 --> 01:11:22,922
[Ha Ha resorts to a Tyson move.]

1215
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:29,037
[Ha Ha rips off the Five with his teeth!]

1216
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:31,614
- I'll give you this one.
- Okay, give it to me.

1217
01:11:31,615 --> 01:11:33,054
[Swaps out the two numbers.]

1218
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:39,362
[Ha Ha gives Jae Suk his Division symbol.]

1219
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:43,036
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Five, clear.

1220
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:45,039
[Ha Ha and Suk Jin clears Five.]

1221
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,897
Seo Jin, what floor are you on?

1222
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:50,116
I now have a Division sign,
which I know Gary has.

1223
01:11:50,117 --> 01:11:52,943
Chae Won has the Four that you need.

1224
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:56,671
You need to come down for us to do this,
so come down to the second floor.

1225
01:11:57,884 --> 01:11:59,509
Seriously.

1226
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,648
[Ugh, this is so bothersome.]

1227
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,835
Hey, just get up here!
Hey!

1228
01:12:09,836 --> 01:12:13,715
- You're going to be had!
- I'm sure Jong Kook will win anyway.

1229
01:12:14,805 --> 01:12:17,394
We lost the game.
How are we to beat Jong Kook?

1230
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:20,694
[Guys, it's easier to just give up.]

1231
01:12:21,777 --> 01:12:25,971
[Meanwhile, the rest of the players
haven't given up and are still battling.]

1232
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:33,072
Why are you laying down?
You can't lay down here.

1233
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:39,559
[Is something going on over there?]

1234
01:12:40,253 --> 01:12:42,808
There's still Suk Jin.
Let's go after Suk Jin.

1235
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:48,501
[Mr. Grumpy sits himself back down.]

1236
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:50,073
I can't believe how hard
everyone's working at this.

1237
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:55,938
[With their two current cards,
they only need one more match to win.]

1238
01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:59,035
[Just then!
Jae Suk spots the Four!]

1239
01:12:59,036 --> 01:13:03,452
[Ambushes Chae Won... and fails.]

1240
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:06,002
[Lays back down on the ground.]

1241
01:13:06,003 --> 01:13:08,767
- Chae Won, I need that number!
- No, don't do it!

1242
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,352
We can't let Jae Suk win!

1243
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,758
[Seung Gi chases Jae Suk away
with Kwang Soo's help.]

1244
01:13:14,759 --> 01:13:16,751
You can get up, Chae Won.

1245
01:13:17,357 --> 01:13:19,275
Get up, Chae Won.

1246
01:13:19,276 --> 01:13:22,860
- What are you doing?
- Why is she on the floor?

1247
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,611
- Come on, get up.
- You can't sleep down there.

1248
01:13:25,612 --> 01:13:29,139
What was Jae Suk going for?
Jae Suk needs Chae Won's number to win.

1249
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:32,217
- Chae Won needs to be careful of Jae Suk.
- We can't let Jae Suk win!

1250
01:13:32,218 --> 01:13:35,591
- Seung Gi, you have to protect Chae Won.
- Seung Gi, you have to stick with me.

1251
01:13:35,592 --> 01:13:38,151
- You have to stick with me.
- There's nothing you can do about this.

1252
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:40,145
[Jae Suk is now targeted
as their number one enemy.]

1253
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,357
If not me, then someone else will win.

1254
01:13:42,358 --> 01:13:44,557
Let's go find Seo Jin.

1255
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:47,783
[Seung Gi and Chae Won leave
to go search for Seo Jin and his Four.]

1256
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:54,735
[Ha Ha and Seung Gi immediately
corner Seo Jin for his number.]

1257
01:13:55,857 --> 01:13:58,689
No, you're not coming after me.

1258
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:01,863
[Mr. Grumpy runs away with
his bangs flying in the breeze.]

1259
01:14:02,929 --> 01:14:06,975
[Seung Gi can clear Four if
he can take Seo Jin's away.]

1260
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,523
No, you can't.

1261
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:13,847
[We've never seen Mr. Grumpy
quite like this before.]

1262
01:14:13,848 --> 01:14:16,133
Seung Gi, you can't do this to me.

1263
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:19,905
[Seo Jin, this is what Running Man is like.]

1264
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:22,719
- You have to rip it off.
- No, you can't.

1265
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,153
- It's already practically off your back.
- Why are you doing this?

1266
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:27,711
[Mr. Grumpy is desperate
to hold onto his Four?]

1267
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:35,048
[But Ha Ha takes the number instead?]

1268
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:39,525
[Seo Jin's Four is swapped out
for Ha Ha's Six.]

1269
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:43,553
- Seo Jin, you have to grab Ha Ha.
- What is this?

1270
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:46,557
[Ha Ha now has the Four
that Seung Gi needs.]

1271
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:49,541
[What is he talking about?]

1272
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:51,323
Seo Jin, grab Ha Ha for me.

1273
01:14:52,867 --> 01:14:57,118
[Seung Gi requests for Seo Jin's help.]

1274
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,729
You guys take care of it yourselves.

1275
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,100
[The person who took the number is more
desperate than the one who got ripped off.]

1276
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,990
- Seo Jin, did you get it?
- No, I had it taken away.

1277
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:09,834
- Who did?
- What do you have?

1278
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:13,679
- Who took your Four?
- Dong Hoon.

1279
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,208
What do you have now then?
Okay, Ji Hyo has the Six.

1280
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:20,710
Come with me.
We have to stick together now.

1281
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:23,959
[The card battle is reaching its climax.]

1282
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,189
We have to target Ji Hyo now.

1283
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:29,847
[Gary and Ji Hyo are close to
winning the race themselves.]

1284
01:15:31,143 --> 01:15:34,370
[The end is near.]

1285
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:36,728
- We have it, too.
- What did you say?

1286
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:40,575
We have it right here.

1287
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,995
What are you doing?
We have the Division symbol.

1288
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:50,028
[Immediately launches into attack.]

1289
01:15:51,612 --> 01:15:55,159
[Trying to break it up as if breaking up
a fight between his nephews.]

1290
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,534
- Tell him not to do it!
- Get the card, Seo Jin!

1291
01:15:59,164 --> 01:16:04,381
[Either Jae Suk's Division symbol, or
Kwang Soo's Division symbol will be taken.]

1292
01:16:04,382 --> 01:16:07,099
[That'll mark the end of the race.]

1293
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,505
[Something definitely doesn't sound right...]

1294
01:16:14,682 --> 01:16:19,874
[Seung Gi eyes his chance,
and springs an attack on Big-nose.]

1295
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,136
[Did his ambush succeed?]

1296
01:16:22,137 --> 01:16:23,800
[Fails the attempt.]

1297
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:27,733
[To make up for clumsy Seung Gi,
Chae Won launches her own attack.]

1298
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,514
[Chae Won succeeds!]

1299
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:41,080
[The symbol on Kwang Soo's back...
Jae Suk grabs!]

1300
01:16:42,802 --> 01:16:44,716
[And he gets it!]

1301
01:16:48,034 --> 01:16:50,504
[Jae Suk and Seo Jin get the Division!]

1302
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,471
[Seo Jin's unwanted Six is handed off.]

1303
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:55,698
Division, clear!

1304
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:02,387
[Pair matching race- Game over!]

1305
01:17:02,388 --> 01:17:05,100
Today's victory goes to
Yoo Jae Suk and Lee Seo Jin.

1306
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:10,530
Okay, I admit that you won, but Jae Suk's
the only one who shouted it out.

1307
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:12,792
I'm totally serious.

1308
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:17,160
They're supposed to shout it out together,
so let them shout it out together now.

1309
01:17:17,161 --> 01:17:19,374
If they won't do that,
then we can't accept their win.

1310
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,785
[Must I really do that?]

1311
01:17:23,242 --> 01:17:25,442
[They demonstrate how it needs
to be done.]

1312
01:17:25,443 --> 01:17:28,008
Shout it out like that.

1313
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:30,094
I'm just going to leave.

1314
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,791
Hey, listen.
He won't do the first portion of it.

1315
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,907
[Refuses to take the win
if he must go through all the shouting.]

1316
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:42,472
These are just the rules,
so you have to shout it out.

1317
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:45,018
- We were told to shout it out together.
- No, he's right about that.

1318
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,000
Okay.

1319
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:49,649
Mission...

1320
01:17:52,056 --> 01:17:53,982
Okay, fine.

1321
01:17:56,024 --> 01:17:58,614
I think he's about to do it.

1322
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:01,154
[Second attempt.]

1323
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:04,630
Seo Jin, Ellie is watching this right now.

1324
01:18:04,631 --> 01:18:06,400
- Are you ready?
- Do it for Ellie.

1325
01:18:06,401 --> 01:18:08,850
Mission...

1326
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,558
[A little more enthused than earlier.]

1327
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:13,735
We have to shout it out together.
Clear!

1328
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:17,418
[What is Seo Jin doing!]

1329
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:21,992
Okay, let's start over.
We'll take the 'clear.'

1330
01:18:21,993 --> 01:18:24,675
You just have to give the
ending emphasis.

1331
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:27,752
[Must I really do that, too?]

1332
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,966
See?
I did it.

1333
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:38,575
[Finally manages to squeak
something out.]

1334
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:40,564
- That was his best.
- He gave it his best efforts.

1335
01:18:41,245 --> 01:18:46,727
[Now that he 'cleared' the mission,
time to hand out the gold ring prize.]

1336
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:48,032
I bet Ellie would like that.

1337
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:49,878
[Hand that over, too.]

1338
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:55,191
[Puts the ring for his niece
deep in his pocket.]

1339
01:18:55,924 --> 01:18:58,616
[And hands the other ring to Chae Won.]

1340
01:18:58,617 --> 01:19:01,552
[Seung Gi can come back another time
to claim his prize then.]

1341
01:19:02,013 --> 01:19:06,936
Give me the gold that you already owe me.
I still haven't received mine yet.

1342
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:08,766
It's over at his house.

1343
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:15,168
I had so much fun being back together
with my Running Man family again.

1344
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:17,961
I really hope that everyone
loves our movie.

1345
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,822
Chae Won, anything you'd like to say?

1346
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:24,672
I've never ran so hard in all my life.

1347
01:19:24,673 --> 01:19:26,294
You'll come back again, won't you?

1348
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:28,178
You should come back again.

1349
01:19:28,451 --> 01:19:32,327
[A cute E.T. promise instead for an answer.]

1350
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,596
[And a closing word from
our dimpled angel.]

1351
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:39,247
I've never really liked
Running Man to begin with...

1352
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:42,654
and I like it even less now.

1353
01:19:42,655 --> 01:19:44,407
[Dimpled angel's closing remarks.]

1354
01:19:44,408 --> 01:19:46,586
That's a lie.
He's such a liar.

1355
01:19:46,587 --> 01:19:49,926
Did you all see how he reacted when
Seung Gi tried to take his number?

1356
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:53,342
[Even though he may grumble a certain way,
Mr. Grumpy had a lot of fun on the show.]

1357
01:19:54,872 --> 01:20:00,154
[Thank you to Lee Seo Jin, Lee Seung Gi,
and Moon Chae Won for your participation.]
