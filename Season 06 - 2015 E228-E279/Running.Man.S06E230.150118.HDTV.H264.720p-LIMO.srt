<i>From, Ga Young.</i>

15
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:27,699
<i>I want to be the Big Dipper
that shines brightly in your heart.</i>

16
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,350
Okay, I'll call you my very own
Big Dipper from now on.

17
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:37,187
Ah... and please tell Jae Suk
that I really love him?

18
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,483

[The super rookies that'll sweep

[Lee Kwang Soo and the Boys.]

21
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>- I notice that Kwang Soo isn't here.
- I bet he's assigned another role today.</i>

22
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:14,605
- I bet he's up to something else.
- You're the seniors at Running High School.

23
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,409
- We are?
- We're the seniors?

24
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,462
How many years have we been seniors for?

25
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:21,115
I don't know who they are,
but I feel bad for our juniors.

26
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,342
- I wonder who they could be?
- They should just transfer their school.

27
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,415
- There they come.
- I see them coming.

28
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,711
Hey, Kwang Soo's the captain.

29
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:35,856
[An entrance of all the hottest
rookies of 2015.]

[Super rookies have landed.]

31
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:47,737
- Kwang Soo looks like a squid.
- He looks like a squid next to those guys.

32
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:50,650
- I'm the leader.
- How are you the leader?

33
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:53,996
- It's great to see you guys.
- Ugh, I feel so embarrassed.

34
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,604
[Safely putting some distance
between them.]

35
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:00,018
[Their looks are too perfect
for anyone to stand next to.]

36
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,147
- Look at how happy the writers are.
- Yes, they seem way too happy.

37
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,426
- Song Ji Hyo looks happy, too.
- This is great.

38
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:11,608
Hello, my name is Hong Jong Hyun,
and this is my first time on Running Man.

39
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:19,725
[An extensive resume list from
dramas, movies, to variety programs.]

40
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:22,342
[A widely talented entertainer.]

41
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:25,494
Hello, my name is Seo Kang Joon,
and I'm a rookie actor.

42
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:33,287
[Seo Kang Joon, the new icon of flower boys,
and one of the hottest men of 2015.]

Hello, my name is Choi Tae Joon,
and I'm also a rookie actor.

44
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,359
[Made his initial debut in 2001-
The mid-grade rookie actor, Choi Tae Joon.]

45
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:44,278
[An actor who can make any woman's
heart go aflutter with his charm!]

46
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:47,276
Hello, my name is Nam Joo Hyuk,
and I'm also a rookie actor.

47
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:51,498
I hate men like him.
Men who are tall, yet still cute.

48
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:52,871
Yeah, I agree.

49
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:59,880
[An impressive height of 188cm,
with the charm of an innocent boy...]

50
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,339
- Hello, my name is Seo Ha Joon.
- Wow, he looks and sounds so masculine.

51
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:11,539
[Worthy of being called his new nickname,
'The king of the living room.']

52
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,663
[We are Lee Kwang Soo and The Boys.]

53
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:18,559
- Are we their seniors?
- Yes, you're the seniors.

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,515
- The six of you are the school's seniors.
- Hello, Seniors! It's great to meet you!

55
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,212
Happy New Year to all of you!
What are you doing? Bow down!

56
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:30,598
[Flustered and unsure of what to do,
they all drop to the ground for a grand bow.]

57
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:34,117
What are you doing?
Why are you bowing down to me?

58
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,683
There will be two teams of six members each,
with a team of Seniors and a team of Juniors.

59
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:47,987
Today's special winter episode is called,
Investigating the life of male students.

60
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:52,923
You will play a variety of missions that
are crucial to the lives of male students

61
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:58,541
to earn the clues you'll need to correctly
answer the question at the final mission.

62
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:02,173
We have prepared a mission based on
what male students are most curious about.

63
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,788
Figuring out what girls want is what
male students are most curious about.

64
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:12,693
You have to figure out what the number one
answer is from a list of top ten answers.

65
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:14,565
That's hard.
That's not going to be easy.

66
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:19,096
Before we get to that big question,
we have a list of other survey questions.

67
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:23,033
Yes, so this is a list of survey questions
that were given out to female students?

68
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,365
- Yes, these are the questions.
- It's good to know these things.

69
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,842
- You need to know these things.
- I'm curious to know what they are.

70
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,581
We need to know what women want.

71
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:34,180
This question is in regard to
the dating life of teenagers.

72
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,822
I remember those days.

73
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:41,552
- I really remember those days.
- Some of you are dating right now, right?

74
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,035
- Yes.
- You just agreed to it, didn't you?

75
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:45,824
Congratulations!

76
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:50,297
[Naive Joo Hyuk falls for Jae Suk's ploy,
and attempts to remedy his mistake.]

77
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,722
Want to send your girl a video message?

78
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,744
- No, I'm not dating anyone.
- Really? Okay, fine.

79
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,644
Fine, we'll let you slide.

80
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:02,077
He admitted to it without realizing it,
so it's too late to correct his mistake.

81
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,668
Question- One day, you suddenly find
yourself interested in your friend.

82
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,358
- When do you think you'd realize that?
- When you see your friend all dressed up.

83
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,772
- When she's wearing a skirt.
- Once in a while...

84
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:14,393
you find yourself questioning it
when you see her smile.

85
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:16,516
Who are you referring to?

86
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,808
- Who's the girl that you're referring to?
- Oh, it was when I was still in school.

87
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,401
- He's denying that it's now.
- He got himself out of that one.

88
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:24,979
I was getting really excited
thinking that he was going to tell us.

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,446
- Don't say anything.
- I'm feeling nervous about it.

90
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,823
- When she gives off a maternal vibe.
- What?

91
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:32,694
- When she gives off a maternal vibe.
- When she feels maternal?

92
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,647
You must like older women.

93
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:40,102
- Tell us the truth.
- You've dated older women before, right?

94
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,094
- Yes.
- You have, right?

95
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:48,536
- I could tell by the way he said it.
- A lot of men like older women.

96
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:52,065
What about you?
When have you felt that way?

97
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,684
When the girl touches me without thinking
because we're already friends.

98
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:56,666
- When a girl touches you without thinking?
- That's when you feel it?

99
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,748
- That's when you feel it?
- That's the number one answer!

100
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,942
[The number one answer!]

101
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,728
[The moment when you suddenly look at
your friend as something more?]

102
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,627
[When the girl grabs your hand or brushes
your hair back without even thinking.]

103
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:08,083
That's when a guy is suddenly
made to wonder.

104
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,314
- The head...
- In that case...

105
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:15,308
[We'll pass on Kwang Soo's answer.]

106
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,243
You have to give me a chance
to answer, too.

107
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:20,402
- That's Kwang Soo's Achilles' heel.
- What is?

108
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:21,788
- When a girl caresses his hair.
- Is that right?

109
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,831
I don't know who Kwang Soo
will get to meet in the future...

110
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:26,431
Why would you tell everyone out there
what my weak point is?

111
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:29,687
I'm sharing Kwang Soo's weakness
with our future sister-in-law.

112
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,760
It's when you slightly ignore him,
then absently start caressing his head.

113
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,482
- This is what he likes.
- This is what we're talking about.

114
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:39,191
Kwang Soo tried doing that to me before,
and I bashed him in the ears for it.

115
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,801
- Yes, I saw her do it.
- Stop it!

116
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:48,919
We don't know who it'll be,
but let us reiterate it once again.

117
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:51,764
When Kwang Soo touches you on the head,
know that he's putting his moves on you.

118
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:54,658
No, that's not the truth.
I'm just an affectionate person by nature.

119
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:01,561
Our race for the day is to find the answers
to these sorts of questions from our viewers.

120
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,154
That's not as easy as it sounds.

121
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:06,424
Here's the dating question that our viewers
are most curious to know the answer to.

122
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,141
What was the most difficult moment you've
experienced while crushing on someone?

123
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:12,436
This is what our teenage viewers
are most curious to know about?

124
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,719
This question that you just heard
is the big question of the day.

125
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,288
- We already know the answer to that.
- Isn't the answer obvious?

126
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,492
- Isn't it when the girl likes someone else?
- That has to be it.

127
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:23,605
It's when the girl likes
some other guy other than yourself.

128
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:26,090
[Time to reveal the multiple choice answer.]

129
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,807
One- Purposely ignoring me while
being aware of my crush on her.

130
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,614
- Yes, it hurts to be ignored.
- No one can be that mean.

131
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:36,013
- While knowing that he has a crush on her.
- There are girls like that out there.

132
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:40,079
- What's the second option?
- Drawing the line at their friendship.

133
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,267
[Two- Telling him that he's a good friend,
and cutting off any hopes for more.]

134
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:48,552
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this, but I've never
once thought of you as a man.</i>

135
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,739
Three- Waiting around for her to call me
while not having the courage to call myself.

136
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,318
- Yes, I totally know what that's like.
- But you can't call the girl first.

137
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,673
Even going to bed with
the cellphone clutched in your hands.

138
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,949
But I don't think it's nice for
the girl to leave the guy hanging.

139
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,872
Four- When she expresses an interest
in my friend, and asks to meet him.

140
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:14,178
What are you supposed to do then?

141
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:29,966
[Five-
When that person is too popular.]

142
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:35,715
[Six- When she's all I can think about,
and I can't seem to do anything else.]

143
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,908
[Seven- When she asks me for dating advice
because she's in love with someone else.]

144
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,114
- There are seven possible answers.
- Yes.

145
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:49,292
- Find out what the number one answer is.
- Of those seven possible answers?

146
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,813
Yes, you must find that out.

147
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:53,422
- Only one is the correct answer.
- But I agree with them all.

148
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:56,368
- They all sound painful.
- I think number two is the answer.

149
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,757
They're still teenagers,
so I think we need to think simple.

150
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,784
- They're more mature than you think.
- Really?

151
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:10,834
Have any of you personally experienced
any of the aforementioned scenarios?

152
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,518
- Have you?
- Have you experienced any of it?

153
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,706
Have you? No, I doubt it.
These guys wouldn't know about it.

154
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,903
[What's a crush?]

155
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,223
I've experienced every single
one of those scenarios!

156

I don't know why I even bothered asking.
These guys wouldn't know about it.

157
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,310
None of these guys.

[The most difficult moment
while crushing on someone?]

160
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:39,863
I doubt any of those guys have
ever had an unrequited crush on anyone.

161
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:43,998
- I'm sure they have. Everyone has.
- I once had a crush on someone on the bus.

162
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,128
- Really?
- I had a crush on a girl that rode my bus.

163
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,611
- She rode the same bus as you did?
- Yes, for three years.

164
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:50,993
You two rode the same bus
for three years?

165
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:57,017
Do you remember when Chae Yeon confessed
that she used to have a crush on you?

166
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:00,279
A guy with good enough manners to
get concerned and see her home

167
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,197
is the type of guy
that most girls go crazy for.

168
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:07,015
Is it the type of guys that acts protective
of the girl while walking down the street?

169
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,362
The guy that walks on
the outside of the sidewalk.

170
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:13,654
- Throwing out a protective arm, right?
- I do things like that all the time.

171
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,248
Yes, you do things like that a lot.

172
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,574
Jong Kook is always wagging
his tail in front of the girls.

173
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,986
No, I don't!
When have I tagged my tail?

174
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:22,526
When have I ever wagged my tail?

175
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:25,188
If he had been a girl,
then he'd be the conniving type.

176
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,744
- How am I conniving?
- You're totally the conniving type.

177
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,554
- Yes, he'd definitely be like that.
- Stop being so conniving.

178
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,704
Yes, stop trying to confuse us.

179
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:36,584
I wonder what it could be?
We have to think like teenagers.

180
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,254
They surveyed teenagers,
so we have to think like them.

181
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:43,559
But for me, I feel better and put in place
when a girl tells me that we're just friends.

182
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,413
I see, you feel more settled?

183
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:51,903
Don't you think not knowing and
keeping my hopes up would be even harder?

184
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,385
But having her put you in your place
can make you feel more at peace.

185
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,131
You know what I think I'd struggle with?

186
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:00,878
To have her tell me that
she has feelings for my friend.

187
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,712
Friends are very important
in a teenager's life.

188
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,905
Then you could lose both your love
and your friend at the same time.

189
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:08,050
Do you know the song,
'Tested friendship?'

190
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,653
[That song came out
when I was ten years old...]

191
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:13,689
I think I'd struggle with having her
come to me for dating advice.

192
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,365
To have that person come to me for dating
advice when I have feelings for that person?

193
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:22,911
When that person comes to me,
and asks me for different date ideas

194
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,994
then I'd have to tell that person
the things that I'd like to do with them.

195
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,881
Yes, you're right.
That would be so cruel.

196
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:30,191
- Having to tell her that...
- You sound very experienced.

197
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,711
No, I'm not.

198
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,944
And teenagers don't know
when to give up.

199

Since Joo Hyuk is the closest
to the teenage years.

200
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,118

- I've had a crush before.

- I was in third grade.

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,762
- Really? When you were in third grade?
- I had that crush for three years.

203
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:50,145
- Do you want to get beat?
- It was a very serious crush.

204
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:54,728
- Then we ended up dating.
- Really?

205
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:58,793

until things worked out in the end.

- I'm sure that's how most teenagers are.

What about you, Kang Joon?
Have you ever had a crush?

208
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,861
- Yes, when I was in high school.
- So everyone's had a crush before?

209
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:12,020
- Did you end up dating her?
- No, I didn't.

210
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:16,447
- So it never worked out?
- No, I couldn't even talk to her.

I'm betting everything
I have when I say this.

212
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:20,995
I bet if you told her you liked her,
then it would've ended up working out.

00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,828
- Can we count this as a practice round?
- What are you talking about?

316
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,996
Beg the seniors right now!
Please give us a chance.

317
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,847
- Please let that one be a practice round.
- What are you talking about?

318
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,251
[They all follow Captain Kwang's order,
and bow down on the ground.]

319
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,818
- We'll have Suk Jin go first this time.
- Yes, but let this be a practice round, too.

320
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,107
Please!
We're all still young.

321
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,766
We're still learning.
Please do us this one favor.

322
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,861
- Okay, we'll do that.
- Thank you.

323
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,066
Thank you, Seniors!

324
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,529
[Thank you, Seniors.]

325
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,249
- Thank you!
- You guys are very weak players.

326
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,346
We may have been at first,
but we'll do better this time.

327
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,928
You guys are way too weak.
I think you guys need to work out.

328
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,208
We're just getting started!
Sorry!

329
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:03,749
[Just then, Big-nose exacts
his revenge for Jae Suk.]

330
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,107
[An eye for an eye, a dunk for a dunk.]

331
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:11,356
- Big-nose won't let you get away with it.
- Captain.

332
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,526
[Unable to get used to the scene of
Kwang Soo being referred to as 'Captain.']

333
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,186
I really love that.

334
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:19,675
- I've never been called that before.
- Captain?

335
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:21,635
I've waited five years to hear that.

336
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,896
[First time hearing that after
five years of being the youngest member.]

337
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:27,024
- Let's do this before Jong Kook comes out.
- They're talking about Jong Kook.

338
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:30,372
[An emergency meeting on what they
should do before Jong Kook comes out.]

339
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,456
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

340
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,472
- You? You're going to go first?
- But you're our ace player.

341
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:38,126
- No, you can't go first.
- What is this?

342
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,296
We have to keep our hidden card for last.

343
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:43,187
[Look at how happy he is.]

344
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,072
Can you say that stuff to me
a little bit more?

345
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:51,192
You look like Terius right now.
(A hero in a comic book series.)

346
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,722
[Comparing his wet look as that of Terius.]

347
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:57,479
[Checks himself out in the camera.]

348
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:01,867
[The first game was a practice round,
and back to playing the first round.]

349
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:04,035
- Ha Joon used to play rugby.
- Really?

350
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,255
Well, Suk Jin plays the stock market.

351
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:16,649
[First players-
Rugby player vs Stock market player.]

352
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:26,253
[Big-nose isn't the easy target
as they all assumed he'd be.]

353
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,327
[Ha Joon attempts to throw
Big-nose into the water.]

354
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:36,795
[But Big-nose doesn't let Ha Joon go,
and takes him down with him.]

355
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,278
[Second players- Tae Joon vs Gary.]

356
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,272
You have to take him down with you!

357
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:51,793
[An impressive battle of their strength!]

358
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:00,234
[The whistle blows for the third players.]

359
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,841
[What?
He tackles his own teammate, Tae Joon?]

360
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:09,789
What are you doing!

361
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:13,582
[A feisty battle of two on two?]

362
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,663
[Gary and Tae Joon fall in simultaneously.]

363
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:23,037
[Next- Kang Joon and Jae Suk.]

364
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,300
[Kills two birds with one stone!
Jae Suk and Ha Ha are both eliminated!]

365
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,792
What are you guys doing!

366
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,310
[This will no longer be tolerated!
Mr. Capable is on the move.]

367
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:58,538
[Mr. Capable... falls into the water!]

368
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,767
[But what is Kang Joon doing?]

369
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,838
[Clumsy Kang Joon also falls into the water.]

370
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:10,502
[Blank Ji is the only surviving
member of Team Seniors.]

371
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:16,219
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hyuk vs Blank Ji.]

372
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,780
[Monday boyfriend's hair pulling?]

373
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,481
[Oh, Captain... My Captain.]

374
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:38,723
[The unspeakable agony.]

375
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,398
[Ace Blank Ji will not go down
without a fight!]

376
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,032
[Joo Hyuk attempts to
take Blank Ji down with him.]

377
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,326
[Joo Hyuk and Blank Ji falls down,
and Kwang Soo is the last one to fall in.]

378
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:56,533
The winner of the first round is,
Team Juniors!

379
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:58,536
[Team Juniors wins the first round.]

380
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:02,112
[After their first complete failure,
Team Juniors show a new side to them.]

381
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,837
[Team Seniors:0 vs Team Juniors:1]

382
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,632
I must be getting older.
I couldn't handle them.

383
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:11,141
This is the determining round.

384
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,108
We have to make sure to win this.

385
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,406
[With the end of each round,
Team Juniors gather together for a meeting.]

386
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:23,952
What are you guys whispering about?

387
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,720
We need a little bit of time.
These newbies don't know anything.

388
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,147
- Sorry, but give us a little bit more time.
- What are you guys whispering about?

389
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:32,792
[Kwang Soo bows down,
so everyone else bows down.]

390
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,242
I can hear you whispering
something about Jong Kook.

391
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:40,340
One person can hold Jong Kook down,
and another person can push him in.

392
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,622
- You guys are exhausted, aren't you?
- No, we're not.

393
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:45,811
- We're just getting started.
- I heard someone saying that he's tired.

394
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,384
- Who's saying that he's tired?
- I heard someone saying that he's tired.

395
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,468
- Whoever's tired, get out here!
- Not me!

396
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,776
These jerks...

397
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:55,040
- What?
- What did you say?

398
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:58,326
[He was definitely
looking in their direction...]

399
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:04,084
The little jerks.

400
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,229
Little?
Then you must be talking about me.

401
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,876
[Why, I ought to just...]

402
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:14,622
Now that you're all ready,
we'll start the third round.

403
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,434
[Current score- 1:1.
Third round.]

404
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,677
Ready!

405
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,455
[We're not falling for your fake moves.]

406
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,209
- He must be going first.
- Why are you making it so obvious?

407
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:29,125
[Joo Hyuk's awkward at whatever he does.]

408
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,878
Ready.

409
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:36,573
[Round three- Start!]

410
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,327
[Joo Hyuk starts off very delayed.]

411
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,802
Joo Hyuk, you have to stay in there!

412
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,075
[Team Juniors' plan is to stick it out
for as long as they can.]

413
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,884
[Their plan succeeds and
Gary is dragged into the water.]

414
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:59,682
[Second players- Tae Joon vs Jong Kook.]

415
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,844
[Tae Joon's lightning fast takedown.]

416
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:10,184
[Impressive! Tae Joon withstands
Mr. Capable as his opponent.]

417
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:15,245
[Next- Rugby player, Ha Joon vs Big-nose.]

418
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:22,293
[Ha Joon successfully shoves
Mr. Capable into the water.]

419
00:27:22,294 --> 00:27:24,947
[Team Seniors are in danger!]

420
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,844
[A fierce battle between the two teams.]

421
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:37,900
[Jong Hyun doesn't hesitate to
get into the game.]

422
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,873
[With four people already on the platform,
Kang Joon and Ha Ha run in.]

423
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:47,597
You have to take Ha Ha!
Take Ha Ha!

424
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:54,334
[A fierce battle between all the players.]

425
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,480
[Add the last two players into the mix.]

426
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:07,695
[In the midst of all the chaos,
Ha Ha and Kang Joon are shoved in.]

427
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,187
[Blank Ji and Kwang Soo
are next to get shoved in.]

428
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:20,542
[Jong Hyun and Ha Joon
vs Jae Suk and Suk Jin.]

429
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:27,765
[Just then...
Jae Suk attempts to shove them all in!]

430
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:32,635
[But Little Mr. Capable, Ha Joon,
withstands the attack.]

431
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:39,093
[Somehow, the two oldest players...]

432
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,979
Who's grabbing me by my throat?

433
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,412
[It's your own teammate, Big-nose.]

434
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,674
[Even attempts to tickle his opponent,
as taught by Kwang Soo.]

435
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,636
[Just then, Jae Suk counterattacks.]

436
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:55,961
[The final battle ensues!]

437
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,390
[Big-nose lands in the water!]

438
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:06,748
[Jae Suk is the only one left to eliminate!]

[Just then, Jong Hyuk grabs Jae Suk
and drags him into the water with him!]

440
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,041
[After the fierce battle,
Team Juniors wins!]

441
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,761
[Team Seniors 1: Team Juniors:2]

442
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,916
We take back giving you that break.

443
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:35,281
[The seniors are aggravated at having
counted the first round as a practice round.]

444
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:41,178
Everyone gather around.

445
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:44,498
Just look at you guys!

446
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:46,798
[Team Seniors are humiliated after not
having taken their opponents seriously.]

447
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,166
Hey, Rugby.

448
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,862
Get in line over there.

449
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,057
[Ordered to stand in line.]

450
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:58,819
[To all the seniors in the country-
Please do not act like this at home.]

451
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:02,328
Since we gave you a break initially,
we're going to play one more round, got it?

452
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:06,250
In that case, if we win this round,
then give us the seniority status.

453
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,275
- Okay, fine!
- Filthy bastard.

454
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,561
[A never before seen moment of insult
in the history of Running Man.]

455
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,378
We'll accept your offer
if you'll give us the seniority status.

456
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,397
But if you refuse to do that,
then we won't accept the offer.

457
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:17,899
You can take it.

458
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,635
- Then we'll take the seniority status.
- Fine.

459
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,785
[The never-ending scene of insults.]

460
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,495
You're not the seniors yet!

461
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,290
We haven't started yet!

462
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:33,479
- It's only after you've won this round.
- I thought our new status started now.

463
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:36,387
Did your mic fall out?

464
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:42,969
[Angry Yoo Hyuk's slapstick revenge.]

465
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:46,920
[Captain, just let it go.]

466
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:51,718
[Nice! Captain Yoo
lands one on Captain Kwang.]

467
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:55,705
[Captain, you need to cool off.]

468
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,155
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,819
Fine, this is for the seniority status.
If we win, then the seniority status is ours.

470
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,064
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, then let's do this.

471
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:09,168
- We're their seniors by how many years?
- Don't they know their place?

472
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,170
- Seriously!
- I just got dissed by those guys!

473
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:17,811
I have to get them back for this.

474
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:22,180
[Their status aside,
this is a battle for their pride!]

475
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:24,657
This is war!

476
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:28,351
We have to figure out who'll go first
because I think Jong Kook will be first.

477
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:32,613
[Both teams are getting very serious
for this one last battle.]

478
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,770
[Their rarely seen competitiveness
makes its appearance.]

479
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:43,196
Let's shout it out four times.

480
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,151
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting!

481
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:53,536
- Let's give it a rest.
- Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting...

482
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:58,290
[We'll take your ten 'Fighting...']

483
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:09,189
- Okay, let's do this.
- Ugh, they're so aggravating.

484
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,328
[So aggravated!]

485
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:14,992
[This is going to be a close battle!]

486
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:18,525
Fine, we'll show you how scary it can be
when you don't know to fear your seniors.

487
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,383
Let's beat them one more time.

488
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:22,576
[We'll show you our robust youth vs.
We'll show you to fear your seniors.]

489
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,085
If we lose this round,
then it'll be the end of us.

490
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:27,357
[Mr. Capable is getting ready?]

491
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,727
- You're going first?
- Wait.

492
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:32,579
Do you really think that we'll have
Jong Kook go first?

493
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,277
It's no fun to have Jong Kook go first.

494
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,941
Ready!

495
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,194
[Mr. Capable goes in!]

496
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:52,332
[To have Mr. Capable be their first player?
Team Seniors must be feeling nervous, too.]

497
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:56,873
[Second players- Tae Joon...]

498
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,364
[And he's also knocked off
in just one attempt.]

499
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,544
We're sorry, Seniors!
Please forgive us!

500
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:08,031
Come on!

501
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,828
[Ha Joon rushes in towards Mr. Capable.]

502
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:19,604
Stick it out!
You have to stick it out!

503
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:23,403
[Little Mr. Capable, Ha Joon, knocks off
his center and battles three on his own.]

504
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:26,436
[Next players- Kang Joon vs Big-nose.]

505
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,879
[Kang Joon falls back onto the mat
with Mr. Capable's shove.]

506
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:35,386
[And Ha Joon is the target
of everyone's attack.]

507
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:38,582
[But...]

508
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,978
[He maintains his grip on Mr. Capable,
and takes him down with him!]

509
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,070
[On the other hand, Kang Joon still
can't even get on the platform.]

510
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:56,078
[He barely manages to pull himself up,
when Ha Ha knocks him right off.]

511
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:59,477
[Next is Jong Hyun, who always
managed to pull his own weight.]

512
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:02,113
[It's 4 vs 1.
The odds are stacked against him.]

513
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:06,567
[Time for the last players to go in.]

514
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,370
[But...]

515
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,832
[Did my eyes just make a mistake?]

516
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,091
[Blank Ji falls in with her arms
wrapped around Jong Hyun's neck.]

517
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:27,695
Are you kidding me?

518
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,957
[Blank Ji is romantically eliminated.]

519
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:35,425
[It's currently 4 vs 2.]

520
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:38,672
- Come on up here.
- Come up here.

521
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,073
[Here they go!]

522
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,775
[Their numbers may be few, but Kwang Soo
and Jong Hyun put up a good fight.]

523
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:00,617
[Just then, Ha Ha pulls Kwang Soo
into the water with him.]

524
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,740
[Jong Hyun is Team Juniors'
last remaining hope.]

525
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:13,645
[Jong Hyun gives it his all
until his very final moment.]

526
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,850
[Jae Suk and Gary work together
to shove him in.]

527
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,877
[Team Seniors 3: Team Juniors: 2.]

528
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:28,570
[After a long end, Team Seniors wins!]

529
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:35,367
Team Seniors wins the first round!

530
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:38,978
[We've managed to win...
but we're now drained of our energy!]

531
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,751
Okay, I need everyone to gather around.

532
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,092
- You did win, right?
- Yes, of course.

533
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:48,781
[They barely managed to win
thanks to Kkuk's role in their victory.]

534
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:51,643
Even though we won, it's embarrassing
how much we had to struggle to win.

535
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:56,662
- I feel a little embarrassed.
- Yes, I feel the same way.

536
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,244
[A little embarrassed to look
their juniors in the face.]

537
00:35:58,245 --> 00:36:02,750
I've been watching Kwang Soo for five years,
but I've never seen him like this.

538
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,773
[Captain Kwang's never before seen image.]

539
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:08,954
He's the type that'll definitely
let his power go to his head.

540
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,128
[I am Captain Kwang.]

541
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,119
Go to the room on the right
once you leave the pool

542
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,529
and you'll find the hint that you're seeking.

543
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,433
Okay, let's go take a look.
See you later, Juniors.

544
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,973
- See you later.
- Yes, Sir.

545
00:36:25,974 --> 00:36:27,523
[They all salute their seniors.]

546
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:32,066
[What is the first hint that
they've earned?]

547
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:34,286
[Two TV monitors?]

548
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:38,000
Please take the bag.

549
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,960
- Don't let them see it.
- Okay, don't let them see it.

550
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,557
[Takes a look at the card in the bag.]

551
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:46,646
[A chance to look at the dual monitors.]

552
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,457
Your mission is to correctly guess
the number one answer

553
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:53,431
to the question, 'What is your most difficult
moment when you're crushing on someone?'

554
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:57,978
This is your chance to ask a group
of women right here in the city

555
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:02,351
that exact same question through
the use of your monitors.

556
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:03,409
Okay.

557
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:09,032
The winners will get to ask a group of
teenage girls at an art school.

558
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:11,547
[The winners get to ask a group of teenage
girls gathered together at an art school.]

559
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:20,174
[The other team will get to ask a group of
women in their thirties in a chorus group.]

560
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:27,129
The winning team can ask both the groups
of women directly through the monitor.

561
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:31,075
The loser team can listen to the answer
of only the group in their thirties.

562
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:34,303
- Get ready to ask your question.
- I can't let them see me like this.

563
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:35,799
[First up- The group of teenage girls.]

564
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,735
[Team Juniors can't hear with their
headphones on in the back.]

565
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:42,762
- Hi.
- Hi, girls!

566
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:49,091
Listen, girls...

567
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:54,309
[Team Juniors steps forward
to take a look at the monitor.]

568
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,745
Seo Kang Joon!

569
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:01,854
[The teenage girls' focus has already
shifted onto the group of flower boys.]

570
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:03,684
We have a question to ask you.

571
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,564
- Okay!
- Have any of you ever had a crush?

572
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,576
- Me!
- They all have.

573
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:16,137
Tell us what the most difficult part is
when you're crushing on someone.

574
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:19,343
When he doesn't pay attention
to the text message I send him...

575
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:22,662
and you know that face thing...
the online face page?

576
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:25,229
[Ah... Facebook?]

577
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,356
When he updates his Facebook status
and doesn't respond to my text.

578
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:32,061
- Then it must be the ignoring part.
- Okay, I see.

579
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,997
- How about an answer from someone else?
- What about the girl standing next to her?

580
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:38,580
- What is your answer?
- We're all artists here.

581
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:44,089
But the guy I like asked me to draw
a picture of him with his girlfriend.

582
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:47,219
[Ouch, that sounds heartbreaking.]

583
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,528
[It must be this situation.]

584
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,518
How about an answer from someone else?

585
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:59,117
I let the guy know that I like him

586
00:38:59,152 --> 00:39:03,148
but he still remains so obtuse and stupid
and doesn't even acknowledge it.

587
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,253
That's Kim Jong Kook.

588
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:08,769
- When he doesn't like me.
- When he doesn't like her...

589
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:12,000
When he doesn't even like me.

590
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:15,778
When he knows that she likes him,
but when he doesn't like her back?

591
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:17,605
[When he doesn't like me back.]

592
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:20,509
So he draws a clear line?
How about someone else from the back?

593
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,646
Someone else from the back?

594
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:26,965
When I confess my feelings to him,
but he says he just wants to remain friends.

595
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:32,153
- All the answers are here already.
- All the answers are similar.

596
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:33,969
- They're all on the list.
- All the answers are very similar.

597
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,207
Does anyone have anything
that they'd like to say to their crush?

598
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,218
Don't be like that!

599
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:43,769
- You're going to end up regretting it!
- Stop talking about me behind my back!

600
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,801
- I'm going to succeed!
- I'm going to meet someone much better.

601
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:51,724
If you had to pick the number one answer,
then which answer would you pick?

602
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,943
- What would be your number one answer?
- When he just wants to remain friends.

603
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:57,745
- Yes, I agree.
- That's so true.

604
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:01,512
- When a line is drawn?
- Who currently has a crush on someone?

605
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:04,890
- Me!
- It's always that one.

606
00:40:04,891 --> 00:40:07,504
[The ranting and raving of one
grudge-filled teenage girl.]

607
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:12,448
- Why such a long crush?
- You have to. Love has no boundaries on time.

608
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:15,757
[A refreshing answer from a lively girl.]

609
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,884
- Thank you!
- Wish us luck on our exam.

610
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:21,726
Good luck on all your exams!

611
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,801
[Good luck on all your exams!]

612
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:29,758
[They've earned a quite a few hints
from the group of teenage girls.]

613
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:32,659
You can take off your headphones
and listen in on the other conversation.

614
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,478
Please turn on the monitor.

615
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:38,026
- Hello!
- Hello!

616
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:40,756
- You look like you're still in your twenties.
- Yes, you do.

617
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:42,373
[Everyone still looks young and fresh.]

618
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:46,645
- Have any of you ever had a crush on someone?
- Yes.

619
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:49,586
They've all had a crush on someone.

620
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:52,573
What have you found to be
the most upsetting moment?

621
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:55,611
- When before you go to bed...
- When a sad song comes on.

622
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:59,216
Then I think about him when I eat,
and at every other moment.

623
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:04,649
[Something that they've all experienced.]

624
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,497
- When he's all they can think about.
- What other experience have you had?

625
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:15,290
There was a guy that I liked,
but no one knew that I liked him.

626
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:19,632
Then a close friend of mine told me one day
that she had feelings for him.

627
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:23,780
[A similar situation to this one.]

628
00:41:24,426 --> 00:41:29,508
I couldn't even say anything, and I just
got those two together the very next day.

629
00:41:29,543 --> 00:41:32,548
I remember just crying my eyes out
for several days afterward.

630
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:34,344
[A sad memory of getting the other two
together and crying by herself for days.]

631
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:41,805
- Everything that we're hearing...
- Is the same result as the survey results.

632
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:45,800
What is the one thing that you found
to be the most painful thing?

633
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,268
Is it when you cut off all communication,
or is it when they ignore you?

634
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:51,589
Or is it when they tell you
that they like someone else?

635
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,001
When they like someone else.

636
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,141
- It's when they like someone else.
- When they like someone else.

637
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,244
It's when jealousy makes its play.

638
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:01,393
- That's what they remember.
- That's the most painful aspect of it.

639
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,366
Thank you for your help,
and happy new year!

640
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:07,507
[Thank you for all your honesty!]

641
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,512
Are those the same answers as
the teenage girls' answers?

642
00:42:10,513 --> 00:42:12,840
- No, they're not.
- I told you that they're not.

643
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:16,373
[They're not falling for it.]

644
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,760
[Flower Boy Crush Report-
Off to the next mission site.]

645
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:26,737
I should've had Tae Joon
and Ha Joon sit up front.

646
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:29,731
No, we all did a great job.

647
00:42:29,732 --> 00:42:31,621
No, not Joo Hyuk.

648
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:35,025
Kwang Soo, I did good in
the second round.

649
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:38,773
- I think I took four of them down.
- You flew off of there like a feather.

650
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:43,349
- No, I hid from them.
- Of the thirties group...

651
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,240
What is the answer that we
heard from them?

652
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:50,638
When they can't stop
thinking about them at night.

653
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:53,510
- But that's a given.
- They're already in their thirties.

654
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,854
When they feel melancholy
after hearing a sad song.

655
00:42:55,855 --> 00:42:57,652
- I don't think teens would feel that way.
- I agree.

656
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:01,820
When they can't stop thinking about them.
Wasn't that one of the answers?

657
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:05,402
- When they can't stop thinking about them?
- But I don't know if that's a crush.

658
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:08,118
That encompasses everything.
It's like that when you love someone, too.

659
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,288
I don't think you can single that one out.

660
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:16,515
[Different answers from
the women in their thirties.]

661
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:20,371
[Some answers are things that
teenage girls haven't experienced yet.]

662
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,897
I think it's this one. Feigning ignorance
while knowing of their crush on me.

663
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:27,692
Yes, that one is harsh.
When they know of the crush?

664
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:32,159
I think it's either feigning ignorance
or asking for dating advice.

665
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,261
I think it's when they ask for you
to hook them up with someone else.

666
00:43:37,262 --> 00:43:39,040
When they want to be
introduced to someone else?

667
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:44,773
What about when a third person
comes into play?

668
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:48,425
There's a high chance that
it'll be one of those two answers.

669
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:52,400
Yes, those two situations come into
play a lot during teenage years.

670
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:54,394
Yes, I think that's the age for it.

671
00:43:54,395 --> 00:43:58,316
Hey, you know that number one answer
that the teenage girls chose?

672
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:01,902
- Drawing the clear line?
- Yes, I think that could be it, too.

673
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:04,527
That's what those high school girls chose.

674
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:08,358
When your crush tells you that
they just wants to be friends with you.

675
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,728
- That would be tough to hear.
- I had that happen to me in my twenties.

676
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:14,133
That's a very likely thing to happen
when you're in your teens.

677
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:17,879
Since that would happen while in school,
you'd still have to see them all the time.

678
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:20,693
I once told a girl that I was lying
just to save my face.

679
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:22,975
- Because you were embarrassed?
- To save face?

680
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:24,524
[Trying to save face out of embarrassment.]

681
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,448
I'd say, 'You're mine, so let's date.'
Then she'd respond, 'No, I'm not.'

682
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:29,178
To which I'd say, 'I was just lying.'

683
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:32,027
- I've done that a few times.
- You're so pathetic.

684
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:36,524
- That's seriously so pathetic.
- Didn't a girl once tell you to get lost?

685
00:44:36,525 --> 00:44:38,611
- Yes, I've heard that.
- I remember that.

686
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:41,032
I think she was about
two years older than him.

687
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:44,593
Yes, I totally remember that.
You were still in your twenties.

688
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:48,532
- I think she was a little drunk.
- He was trying to put on his cool act.

689
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:51,613
- Can I call you mine?
- Get lost!

690
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:55,174
Trying to act cool never works
when you're confessing your feelings.

691
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:58,065
[Remembering all their bygone memories.]

692
00:44:58,066 --> 00:45:00,786
I only said that to cover up
the nervousness that I felt.

693
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:04,716
[Off to the next location
while lost in their cloud of memories.]

694
00:45:06,231 --> 00:45:08,931
[A small park in the middle of a pond.]

695
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,724
[Team Juniors are the first to arrive.]

696
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:17,017
[Must win this round in order
to win the top clue.]

697
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,749
- I see a start mark over here.
- What is it?

698
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,863
- Should we run there?
- I see an 'R' marked flag.

699
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:25,820
- This already looks difficult.
- Maybe I should take off my coat.

700
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:29,179
Is this a relay race?
I think it's a relay race.

701
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:31,977
Look at all the 'R' marked flags
placed here and there.

702
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:34,743
[What is the second mission
that awaits them here?]

703
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:38,483
- Welcome, Seniors.
- Hello, Sirs.

704
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:40,752
- Hello, Sir.
- Hey, guys.

705
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:43,809
- Who are you guys?
- We're the newbies.

706
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:47,860
- Hello, Sir.
- I'm the youngest of the bunch.

707
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:49,893
[Looks the oldest, but
claims himself to be the youngest.]

708
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:52,184
Here's your second mission.

709
00:45:52,185 --> 00:45:53,906
Your next mission is,
Suncheonman Bay Relay.

710
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:57,808
You're here at Suncheon Lake Park.

711
00:45:57,809 --> 00:45:59,961
They say that this park embodies
the essence of this town.

712
00:45:59,962 --> 00:46:04,288
As you can see, this embodies the mountains,
the lakes and the city of this town

713
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:05,663
and everything has been built
to reflect that essence.

714
00:46:05,664 --> 00:46:08,576
The relay will be divided into six parts

715
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:12,641
and the final runner will have to run up
to the mission zone up at the top.

716
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:16,168
The final runner will finish the mission,
and the winner of that mission wins the race.

717
00:46:16,169 --> 00:46:18,738
- That's how this mission will be played.
- So it's not just a relay run?

718
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,418
You have to win the final mission
to win the race.

719
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:24,541
If the final runner fails the mission,
then everyone has to start over.

720
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:26,621
- Then the mission will start over.
- Start over from the beginning?

721
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:29,047
- From the start line?
- Yes, all the way back to the starting line.

722
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:33,857
[An ominous feeling that this is
going to be a never-ending relay.]

723
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,733
The final runner's mission
will not be known here

724
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:39,699
and it'll be given to only the person
that gets up to the mission zone.

725
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,512
Then the final runner should be someone
who's very smart and clever.

726
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:44,335
Yes, you only have one chance.

727
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:47,196
Only one chance will be given
to successfully complete the mission.

728
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:51,079
- I bet they're fast runners.
- It's okay, here's how we'll go.

729
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,881
[Gary- Ha Ha- Suk Jin- Jong Kook-
Ji Hyo- Jae Suk.]

730
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:56,251
If you fail the mission,
then we're all going to finish you.

731
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:57,841
[Feeling the pressure.]

732
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,715
[Team Junior is figuring out their plan.]

733
00:47:00,716 --> 00:47:03,236
The younger one will probably
think faster on his feet.

734
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:06,344
[Youngest member, Joo Hyuk,
is feeling the pressure.]

735
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:10,246
- No, I feel confident.
- If you fail, then we'll have to start over.

736
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,277
[No matter how fast they run, failure to
succeed the mission means starting over.]

737
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:15,053
If he fails, then let's all give him
a smack in the hand.

738
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:17,319
If he fails the mission, okay?

739
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,401
That's the starting line.

740
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:20,851
[Everyone to their stations.]

741
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,964
[They're starting to realize
the true scale of the course.]

742
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:25,600
We're going to have to run
like Cristiano Ronaldo.

743
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:28,503
- I think we'll be good at the running part.
- You're all fast runners, right?

744
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:30,302
- I'm confident in my running skills.
- You're a fast runner, aren't you?

745
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,377
- We have to win this.
- I agree.

746
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:35,416
- We have to win at things like this.
- We have to be resolute.

747
00:47:39,854 --> 00:47:42,806
Who's the third runner over there?
Who's their third runner?

748
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:47,881
[First runners- Gary vs Kwang Soo.]

749
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:49,680
Please stand at the starting mark.

750
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:53,602
Don't you think that you're
being too mean?

751
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,424
[Second runners- Ha Ha vs Tae Joon.]

752
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:59,724
- This is where we'll have to start over?
- Yeah.

753
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:03,890
When the second runner comes up...
Watch yourself because I may shove you.

754
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:09,644
[Fourth runners- Jong Kook vs Jong Hyun.]

755
00:48:09,645 --> 00:48:11,574
You seem really strong.

756
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:17,325
I'm afraid that you're going to
hurt me even while running.

757
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:21,272
[Will we see the monstrous strength of
Mr. Capable during the relay race?]

758
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:26,496
What do you guys do for fun
when you're in your twenties?

759
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:30,848
- I like playing video games at home.
- You like playing video games?

760
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:33,462
Kang Joon.

761
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:36,882
[Crucial final runners-
Kang Joon vs Jae Suk.]

762
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:40,880
- Team Juniors, fighting!
- Fighting!

763
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:45,074
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

764
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:49,225
[Team Seniors vs Team Juniors-
Second battle with their pride on the line.]

765
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,641
[Suncheonman Bay Relay- Round One.]

766
00:48:57,317 --> 00:49:00,203
[Starts off at a dead run
at the sound of the whistle.]

767
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:03,319
- Wow, he's so fast.
- This is good!

768
00:49:05,637 --> 00:49:07,943
Wow, he's so fast!

769
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:13,711
[The two runners are already closing in!]

770
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:17,655
[Fast footed Gary is almost
to the second runner, Ha Ha.]

771
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:21,131
[Formidable opponent, Kwang Soo,
runs full speed ahead on his long legs.]

772
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:23,477
Take it easy!

773
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:27,827
[Kwang Soo hands off the baton to Tae Joon.]

774
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,126
Here, Dong Hoon!

775
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:35,038
[Gary also hands off his baton to Ha Ha.]

776
00:49:37,025 --> 00:49:39,721
[Team Juniors is in the lead
by the split of a hair.]

777
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:42,418
They're the second runners
and they're headed over to us.

778
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:45,928
- This is like a blockbuster movie.
- No, that's not the way!

779
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:50,503
[The two runners are neck and neck!]

780
00:49:51,036 --> 00:49:53,281
[Already handing it off
to the third runners.]

781
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,348
[Big-nose fails to grab the baton
in his attempt to delay Ha Joon.]

782

[Ha Joon takes this moment
to get a lead on Suk Jin.]

783

[The gap is growing between the two teams.]

784
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:09,386
He's fast.

785
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:15,864
[Ha Joon defies gravity to run,
and Big-nose defies his age to catch up.]

786
00:50:15,865 --> 00:50:17,517
It's already over.

over to Jong Hyun.]

as soon as the baton is in his hand.]

hands the baton off to Kkuk.]

to interfere in baton hand-off.]

796
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:59,547
[Mr. Capable arrives in the meantime.]

797
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:04,306
[Joo Hyuk's vigorous run.]

798
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:08,385
[But Ace will not let the twenty-something
beat her down!]

799
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,296
[Final runner, Kang Joon, gets the baton!]

800
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,396
Start running!

801
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:17,586
[Ace comes in right behind.]

802
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,196
[Jae Suk also gets on his way.]

803
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,830
[The final mission zone.]

804
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,530
- I hope Kang Joon succeeds.
- If he succeeds, then we win.

805
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:30,278
[Kang Joon is first
to arrive at the mission zone.]

806
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,708
[But Jae Suk is right on his tail.]

807
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:35,080
[Starts the mission almost simultaneously.]

808
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:38,190
[Catch the five gonggi pieces in one swoop.]

809
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:39,776
In one try?

810
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:42,218
- It's whomever succeeds first.
- You have to catch them all together.

811
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:45,202
[Kang Joon wrongly grabs the pieces
in his haste.]

812
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:48,515
[Team Junior may have been fast, but
they're slow at understanding the task.]

813
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,118
Jae Suk will go first.

814
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,744
[Jae Suk takes the first turn.]

815
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:56,421
[He must first get all five pieces
on top of his hand.]

816
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,713
[Jae Suk fails.]

817
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,417
[It's now Kang Joon's turn.]

818
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:07,472
[Successfully gets all five pieces
on top of his hand.]

819
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:10,217
[Now he must catch them all
in order to succeed!]

820
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:21,813
[Kang Joon fails.]

821
00:52:24,162 --> 00:52:28,630
[Both teams must get back
to their starting lines.]

822
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,772
Ugh, this is so disappointing!

823
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:34,406
- We have to go back?
- I had no idea it'd be gonggi.

824
00:52:34,407 --> 00:52:36,998
- I had no idea it would be that.
- You failed?

825
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:39,116
[We have to run again?]

826
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:41,845
I wasn't able to flip my wrist.

827
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:45,582
Hey, you just needed to catch
the five gonggi pieces to win the mission?

828
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,342
Yeah, just catch the pieces.
Do you want to do it?

829
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:49,619
- Okay, I'll do it.
- I think we can switch the order.

830
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,332
I know that Suk Jin
doesn't want to run again.

831
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,004
Come up here, Suk Jin.

832
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,151
Jong Hyun, do you want to do it?
Can you handle it?

833
00:52:56,186 --> 00:52:57,830
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

834
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,212
Tae Joon, do you want to go first?
We need a fast start.

835
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:02,437
[Leader Giraffe gives out the orders.]

836
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,712
- Is everyone ready for the second round?
- Yes.

837
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:11,502
[Getting ready to show off
their skills once again.]

838
00:53:13,175 --> 00:53:15,682
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

839
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:17,050
Ready!

840
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:20,473
[Gary and Tae Joon's alarming speed.]

841
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,975
[Suncheonman Bay Relay- Round Two.]

842
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:29,336
[Gary's explosion of speed.]

843
00:53:29,337 --> 00:53:31,541
Wow, he's so fast.

844
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,284
[Tae Joon also takes off running.]

845
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:38,286
[An explosion of a 25 year-old's energy.]

846
00:53:39,747 --> 00:53:44,873
[Full speed ahead Gary is
already closing in at 'R2'.]

847
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,614
Do you guys have motors on your feet?

848
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:54,666
Wow, he's really fast.

849
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,472
[Tae Joon hands off the baton
to Kwang Soo.]

850
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:03,322
[Ha Ha receives the baton
almost at the same time.]

851
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,466
Ha Ha's quick.

852
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,775
[A close competition!]

853
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:17,724
[Team Junior touches off first!]

854
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:21,311
Wow, Running Man is no joke.

855
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:23,630
- Running Man's stamina is no joke.
- Your stamina improves on the show.

856
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:26,586
[Being on Running Man is no different
than hitting the gym regularly!]

857
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,868
[Ha Joon's alarming speed...
and Grasshopper's impressive spurt.]

858
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,080
- They're really fast.
- They're almost here already.

859
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:40,342
[Ha Joon's powerful dead run.]

860
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,434
Wow, you're really fast.

861
00:54:45,435 --> 00:54:47,195
[Kang Joon touches off.]

862
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,120
[And Jae Suk hands his off to Kkuk.]

863
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,401
[Once again, Kkuk is in full power mode.]

864
00:54:52,402 --> 00:54:54,582
- Fighting!
- Kang Joon!

865
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,403
Jong Kook's really fast.
Fighting!

866
00:54:56,404 --> 00:54:59,878
[The two runners don't even seem to
notice the curved path in front of them.]

867
00:55:04,077 --> 00:55:05,840
[Touches off almost simultaneously.]

868
00:55:05,841 --> 00:55:07,850
Good, Jong Kook closed down the gap.

869
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:09,900
We have to succeed the mission this time.

870
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:14,845
[22 year-old's enthusiastic run.]

871
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,487
[But Ace is catching up
even while in a skirt!]

872
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:22,263
- I'll get this done!
- Let's finish this, Jong Hyun!

873
00:55:25,503 --> 00:55:28,049
[Team Junior starts off.]

874
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:30,941
[Team Senior starts off.]

875
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:35,839
- Ji Hyo's so quick!
- Go!

876
00:55:36,553 --> 00:55:39,483
[Team Juniors is once again first to arrive.]

877
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:42,147
[Arrives to do the final mission.]

878
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,981
[But it's not the same mission!]

879
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:53,177
[Thought that the mission
would be the same...]

880
00:55:53,178 --> 00:55:56,704
[That's why the final runners
were chosen the way they were.]

881
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:04,673
[Smack the book and flip the coins
over twice in a row.]

882
00:56:04,674 --> 00:56:09,057
[While Jong Hyun gets the book ready,
Big-nose also arrives.]

883
00:56:11,017 --> 00:56:13,506
- Please.
- Did they switch up the mission?

884
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:15,769
[If they fail again, then they'd
have to go back to running.]

885
00:56:16,449 --> 00:56:18,158
I hope they succeed this time.

886
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:20,863
[Still getting ready.]

887
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,404
[Big-nose immediately launches his attempt.]

888
00:56:25,136 --> 00:56:27,504
[Big-nose immediately succeeds
his first attempt.]

889
00:56:27,505 --> 00:56:30,313
[Even though he was first to arrive,
he's still busy getting prepared.]

890
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:32,804
[Jong Hyun takes his first attempt.]

891
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:37,401
[Jong Hyun also succeeds his first attempt.]

892
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,760
[Please succeed the mission.]

893
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:45,364
[Only one more coin left to go.]

894
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:51,052
[What will be the result?]

895
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:53,572
I think they did it.

896
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:56,240
They did it?

897
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:00,306
- I think we did it!
- But that's Suk Jin's voice.

898
00:57:03,183 --> 00:57:06,554
We did it!
We won!

899
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:10,379
We did it!
We won!

900
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,732
[Team Senior wins
Suncheonman Bay Relay Race.]

901
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,863
Didn't we get there first?

902
00:57:19,688 --> 00:57:21,671
But we got there faster.

903
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,840
[Jong Hyun fails.]

904
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:29,639
[Big-nose succeeds.]

905
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,797
[Big-nose successfully flips
two coins over in a row.]

906
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:43,422
[Why won't this work?]

907
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,298
You did great!

908
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:48,118
[Neither of them can believe
the outcome of their game.]

909
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:52,024
[These youngsters can't accept
their failure.]

910
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:53,778
How are you supposed to do this?

911
00:57:54,277 --> 00:57:59,032
[Team Seniors wins
with Big-nose's performance.]

912
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,265
We won!

913
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,104
Hey, Hong Jong Hyun!

914
00:58:05,745 --> 00:58:08,394
Where's the baton?
We have to spank him.

915
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:10,625
[Jong Hyun needs to be spanked.]

916
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:15,170
[Please forgive me...
I thought it was going to be gonggi.]

917
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,496
[Just keeps slapping away at the book.]

918
00:58:19,264 --> 00:58:21,718
[Can we do it over with gonggi?]

919
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:26,109
[Big-nose is greeted with fanfare.]

920
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:30,136
[Big-nose mentality plays on.]

921
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:34,282
- What are you guys going to do?
- You guys aren't even a match for us.

922
00:58:34,283 --> 00:58:37,866
- Are you guys even good at anything?
- We thought it was going to be gonggi again.

923
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:40,892
- You guys don't look too happy.
- We thought we were going to win.

924
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:42,490
[Off to receive their next hint.]

925
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:46,274
[Time to hand out the clues.]

926
00:58:46,275 --> 00:58:48,607
- 60 seconds in the answer room?
- We've got 30 seconds. Not bad.

927
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:55,311
There are a total of 10,000 notes of
surveyed answers in the room.

928
00:58:55,919 --> 00:59:00,282
It's all the answers that we've received
from the survey that was conducted.

929
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:04,298
Which means, the number one answer has
the most number of pages in the room.

930
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:08,347
And there's another very special clue
that's hidden amongst the notes.

931
00:59:08,348 --> 00:59:15,241
There's only one note that is chosen
as the Lucky Eraser Chance.

932
00:59:15,242 --> 00:59:20,159
The team that finds this note will
be given one correct answer.

933
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:24,613
[Team Seniors will go first.]

934
00:59:25,211 --> 00:59:27,240
I'll take half of this wall.

935
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:36,245
[The answer with the most amount of notes
is today's correct answer.]

936
00:59:43,427 --> 00:59:46,085
We have to look for the erasure chance.

937
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,625
[Only one of these numerous notes
is their erasure chance.]

938
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:52,621
[The feelings of these teenage girls
is so confusing to receive.]

939
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:58,279
It's either being ignored,
or not even being acknowledged.

940
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:04,630
[Only ten seconds left on the clock,
but there are 10,000 notes on the walls.]

941
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:08,494
- I don't know which has the most.
- What about the erasure clue?

942
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:16,219
- It's not being acknowledged.
- How are we to figure this out?

943
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,590
[Which of the answer has
the most number of notes?]

944
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:23,200
Wow, there are so many in there.
There are way too many.

945
01:00:24,396 --> 01:00:27,208
I'll call you my senior
if you can find the erasure.

946
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:31,680
- There's no way they're going to find it.
- Let's give it a try.

947
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:32,928
[Only 30 seconds on the clock.]

948
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,710
[Team Juniors turn.]

949
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:41,154
[Not even any time to take in the shock.]

950
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,924
[Telling me their feelings for someone else,
and asking me for dating advice.]

951
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:48,408
- See which one is mostly the same.
- There are too many up here.

952
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:52,078
I think that has the most.

953
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,906
- It's not being acknowledged.
- We needed more time in there.

954
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:57,796
- No, that's not the one.
- I'm telling you that it is.

955
01:00:58,133 --> 01:00:59,876
[Everyone offers a different answer.]

956
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:02,514
- I saw not being acknowledged.
- I saw liking someone else.

957
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:04,419
18 seconds.

958
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,418
I see wanting to be friends
more than anything else.

959
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:09,520
I see being invisible
more than anything else.

960
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:12,053
[All their opinions are differing.]

961
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,077
It's the erasure!

962
01:01:19,078 --> 01:01:21,767
[Kwang Soo discovers the erasure clue.]

963
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,428
[A one in 10,000 probability!]

964
01:01:27,528 --> 01:01:30,411
[That's a lie.]

965
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:33,513
Because Kwang Soo's
the first one that said it.

966
01:01:33,514 --> 01:01:35,582
Kwang Soo was the first one
to have said it.

967
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:40,305
[Kwang Soo pulls off a miracle.]

968
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,838
I'm your senior!

969
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:47,121
- This is the erasure chance.
- You actually found it?

970
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:48,765
[Gains seniority after finding his clue.]

971
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:51,074
- You actually found it?
- Where?

972
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,135
- You found it?
- He really did.

973
01:01:53,136 --> 01:01:55,811
- It was on the bottom.
- I can't believe you actually found it.

974
01:01:55,812 --> 01:02:00,847
He saw a lot of wanting to be friends,
and he found a lot of being invisible.

975
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:03,475
They saw something different from ours.

976
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:05,693
Wanting to be friends is what I saw.

977
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,465
[Off to the final mission site.]

978
01:02:10,634 --> 01:02:13,121
I looked through two different walls.

979
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:15,159
I saw liking someone else the most.

980
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:21,584
I saw that and being invisible,
and I saw being invisible the most.

981
01:02:21,585 --> 01:02:24,457
I only saw what was in front of me.

982
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,743
I saw asking for dating advice the most.

983
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:30,907
It's either asking for dating advice,
or not being able to get in touch.

984
01:02:30,942 --> 01:02:34,023
- Don't you think?
- I think it's liking someone else.

985
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:38,143
[Team Juniors runs into a group
of teenage girls by a chance.]

986
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:39,966
- How old are you?
- 15?

987
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:43,115
- She's 15 years old?
- Wait.

988
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:46,823
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

989
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:51,002
You have? Then at which moment
did you most struggle with?

990
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:54,429
- Which one of these?
- This one.

991
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,753
- How old are you?
- When he's too popular?

992
01:02:56,754 --> 01:03:00,527
[Ha Joon's received response-
'When he's too popular.']

993
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:03,687
- Have you ever had a crush?
- What did you find to be most difficult?

994
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:06,842
- When I couldn't get in touch with him?
- When she couldn't get in touch with him.

995
01:03:06,843 --> 01:03:09,265
They all have different answers.

996
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:11,675
- When you had to wait around?
- Yes, I think that was the toughest.

997
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:14,761
- Waiting around is the toughest part.
- That really is.

998
01:03:14,762 --> 01:03:18,121
[The teenage girls' number one answer-
Having to wait around.]

999
01:03:18,122 --> 01:03:21,102
[Really?]

1000
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:24,460
- I really am curious now.
- Thanks for your help!

1001
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:29,992
[Thanks for all your help!]

1002
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:33,331
- What do you think?
- Should we try figuring it out?

1003
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:37,057
I think it's being ignored when
they know that you like them.

1004
01:03:37,058 --> 01:03:40,591
- What do you think, Tae Joon?
- I really have no idea.

1005
01:03:40,592 --> 01:03:42,600
What if you had to pick one?

1006
01:03:43,151 --> 01:03:46,578
I'm going to go with what she said.
'When he's too popular with others.'

1007
01:03:47,149 --> 01:03:51,127
I think it's asking me for dating advice
because he likes someone else.

1008
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:52,813
- Me, too.
- I agree.

1009
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:56,161
I think that would be the toughest part, too.

1010
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,895
- Wow, this is really hard.
- I feel even more confused now.

1011
01:04:03,371 --> 01:04:06,238
[A few moments later.]

1012
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:10,381
[Everyone seems to be
searching for something.]

1013
01:04:10,382 --> 01:04:14,139
[What could they be searching for?]

1014
01:04:14,538 --> 01:04:17,936
How am I supposed to find it
in this large space?

1015
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,460
Here's your final mission of the race.

1016
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:26,339
I told you that you needed to correctly
guess the number one answer to the survey.

1017
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,294
You'll have to find a beach ball
that contains the contents of the answer.

1018
01:04:30,295 --> 01:04:34,911
There are a total of seven beach balls
with the possible answers written on them.

1019
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:38,699
You have to find the beach ball
and score it in the goal

1020
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,705
in order to win the game.
There's a goal post on the first floor

1021
01:04:41,706 --> 01:04:44,917
and one on the second floor,
totaling two goal posts.

1022
01:04:44,918 --> 01:04:48,658
If you throw in a ball with
the incorrect answer written on the ball

1023
01:04:48,693 --> 01:04:51,194
then the person who threw the ball
will be eliminated from the game.

1024
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:54,734
Team Juniors used up
their one chance, correct?

1025
01:04:54,735 --> 01:04:58,364
- What did you use it on?
- It was a huge help to us.

1026
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:03,280
- What we thought was the correct answer...
- It's when they want to be friends, right?

1027
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:05,682
- No, it's not that one.
- It's not? Okay, thanks.

1028
01:05:07,376 --> 01:05:10,054
[Why did you have to tell them that?]

1029
01:05:11,536 --> 01:05:15,574
- No, that's not what I was saying...
- Just stop talking!

1030
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,170
- Just stop talking!
- He said it's not that one.

1031
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,231
- Tae Joon...
- I made a mistake.

1032
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:23,964
He says he made a mistake.

1033
01:05:25,328 --> 01:05:27,354
[Find the woman's heart- Start.]

1034
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:29,606
Wow, this really is Running Man.

1035
01:05:30,022 --> 01:05:31,556
I wonder where the ball is?

1036
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:36,062
No, there's nothing in here.

1037
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:39,525
- I just wanted to try doing that.
- Yes, I knew you would.

1038
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:46,476
- Where...
- Is the beach ball?

1039
01:05:46,477 --> 01:05:48,046
[Where's the beach ball?]

1040
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:50,840
[Meanwhile, Joo Hyuk is...]

1041
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:52,469
I found it.

1042
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:55,156
[Immediately discovers
one of the beach balls.]

1043
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:03,764
[Gets a beach ball in his hands.]

1044
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:07,800
['You're just a friend.'
Puts the person in the friend zone.]

1045
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:14,031
- Isn't it better to be put in your place?
- Yes, I think that would actually be easier.

1046
01:06:14,476 --> 01:06:17,736
I think I got the best one.

1047
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:22,517
This is a dead-end.

1048
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:26,299
No matter where I go...

1049
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:31,733
I try to look cool,
but I don't think I can pull it off.

1050
01:06:32,857 --> 01:06:37,385
[Yoo Hyuk and Jong Hyun search
through all the lockers.]

1051
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:46,309
[Telling me that they like my friend,
and wanting to be introduced.]

1052
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:48,353
[Makes a run for it.]

1053
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,437
[Jae Suk, where are you going?]

1054
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:02,184
[They all must think that
Jae Suk's beach ball is the right answer?]

1055
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,969
Jae Suk, I'm coming!

1056
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:06,831
What is it?

1057
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:10,358
[Ha Joon intercepts.]

1058
01:07:13,106 --> 01:07:16,464
[Runs off with the beach ball
to the nearest goal post.]

1059
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:18,947
[Runs off at a dead run.]

1060
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:21,180
Look to see what it says first!

1061
01:07:21,181 --> 01:07:22,773
Ha Joon!

1062
01:07:25,463 --> 01:07:27,913
What is it?
What does it say?

1063
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:32,428
[Telling me that they like my friend,
and wanting to be introduced.]

1064
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:34,426
No, that's not the number one answer.

1065
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:37,538
[Could this be the answer?]

1066
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,276
- This is the special clue that you found.
- Okay, what is it?

1067
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:42,908
[Team Juniors receives their special clue.]

1068
01:07:42,909 --> 01:07:46,512
[Finds out which one
is the incorrect answer.]

1069
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:48,688
This is the number four answer?

1070
01:07:49,576 --> 01:07:52,548
I suddenly feel so lost.

1071
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:56,190
- Are you sure that's the same one?
- This was the number four answer.

1072
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:58,453
No, this isn't the number one answer.

1073
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:00,082
That's not the one.

1074
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:03,866
Wait, that's my ball.
I was the one that found it!

1075
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:06,756
You can't toy with us!

1076
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:09,898
Run, Tae Joon!
You have to run!

1077
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:12,367
[Tae Joon runs away with
the stolen ball in his hand.]

1078
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:14,318
Where's the goal post?

1079
01:08:14,712 --> 01:08:17,992
[Tae Joon, you're not thinking of
throwing in the ball, are you?]

1080
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:23,206
[Wait...]

1081
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:24,904
Tae Joon!

1082
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:26,601
Where's the goal?

1083
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:31,428
[He looks like he's about to
slam-dunk the ball!]

1084
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:33,305
Where did Tae Joon go?

1085
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,911
[Used up their chance to check
one of the incorrect answers...]

1086
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:40,676
I suddenly feel so lost.

1087
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:46,443
[No, that can't be the ball
that Tae Joon has in his hands.]

1088
01:08:48,094 --> 01:08:51,544
[But if this is the correct answer,
then Team Juniors could win the race.]

1089
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:54,204
[Slam dunk!]

1090
01:08:54,205 --> 01:08:57,452
[Saying that they like my friend,
and wanting to be introduced.]

1091
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,528
[Could that be the correct answer?]

1092
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:03,709
- I put it in there.
- I don't think that's the right answer.

1093
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,848
No, that's not it.
I don't think that's the right answer.

1094
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:13,405
- Choi Tae Joon, out.
- Yes!

1095
01:09:13,406 --> 01:09:15,346
[Tae Joon eliminates himself.]

1096
01:09:15,347 --> 01:09:18,376
<i>Choi Tae Joon, out.</i>

1097
01:09:22,724 --> 01:09:24,558
[The reason why his teammates
seem so frustrated.]

1098
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:27,108
I told you that wasn't the correct answer!

1099
01:09:27,574 --> 01:09:29,422
[Huh?]

1100
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:33,783
You still dunk it in there even after
the hint told you that wasn't it?

1101
01:09:34,264 --> 01:09:39,923
[The incorrect answer that they gained
after using their erasure chance...]

1102
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:46,392
[Number four answer- Wanting to be introduced
to one of your friends instead.]

1103
01:09:46,393 --> 01:09:53,579
[Even after knowing that's incorrect,
he still dunks the ball in the goal...]

1104
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:56,944
What were you thinking?
We already knew that wasn't it!

1105
01:09:56,945 --> 01:09:58,982
- That's the hint we were given.
- Seriously?

1106
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:03,223
- I didn't realize that was it.
- That's the erasure chance we were given.

1107
01:10:03,258 --> 01:10:08,070
- Who just got ousted?
- Was that really the fourth answer?

1108
01:10:08,602 --> 01:10:11,015
That's the wrong answer that we saw
as the erasure clue.

1109
01:10:11,016 --> 01:10:12,850
- You threw that ball in there?
- Yes.

1110
01:10:12,851 --> 01:10:15,347
- Why would you do that?
- I thought that was the correct answer.

1111
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:17,949
[Tae Joon ousts himself out of the game.]

1112
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:30,405
[Even Team Seniors thought
that was the number one answer.]

1113
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:31,797
- I thought that was the answer.
- No, it wasn't.

1114
01:10:31,798 --> 01:10:35,455
- That's why he was eliminated.
- I think it's having to wait around.

1115
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:38,634
I think it's either that one,
or something else very simple.

1116
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:41,361
Just the fact of crushing on someone
could be a painful thing.

1117
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,896
So I think it could be
having to wait around for them.

1118
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:49,505
[Jong Hyun's still searching for more balls
even with one already in his hand.]

1119
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:58,651
[Discovers another beach ball.]

1120
01:11:01,228 --> 01:11:04,672
[Unable to call first,
and just having to wait around.]

1121
01:11:05,518 --> 01:11:09,938
[Should I just keep waiting for
others to score more balls?]

1122
01:11:11,224 --> 01:11:13,710
[Kang Joon is also on the search
for the beach balls.]

1123
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,876
[A beach ball is found.]

1124
01:11:19,877 --> 01:11:21,836
[When that person
is all they can think about.]

1125
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,613
[Hides the ball away under lock and key
so that no one else can get it.]

1126
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,217
Oh, what's this?

1127
01:11:30,763 --> 01:11:33,792
[Gary also finds a beach ball.]

1128
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:40,881
[Finds his own team's
number one estimated answer.]

1129
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:43,351
- I found the most crucial one.
- What is it?

1130
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:45,766
- Gary, I'll put it in there.
- Dong Hoon!

1131
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:48,961
- What is it? I think it's this one.
- I think this is very important.

1132
01:11:48,962 --> 01:11:52,519
- Asking for dating advice?
- I think this is the one. Put it in there.

1133
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,933
- That's the one we were thinking.
- I told you that this is the one.

1134
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:57,485
[Asking me for dating advice.]

1135
01:11:57,486 --> 01:12:00,773
There are a lot of notes on
asking for dating advice.

1136
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:04,433
[The dating advice notes
were most commonly seen by Ha Ha.]

1137
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:09,042
I really saw the most on
asking for dating advice.

1138
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:17,199
- Please let this be the correct answer.
- This is the answer we were thinking of.

1139
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,513
[If that really is the number one answer,
then they win the race.]

1140
01:12:21,414 --> 01:12:23,852
That would be so cruel.
That has to be it. We won.

1141
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:27,796
<i>Ha Ha, out.</i>

1142
01:12:27,797 --> 01:12:29,927
[We were thinking that was too easy.]

1143
01:12:30,057 --> 01:12:32,214
- What could be more cruel than that?
- That's not it, either?

1144
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,649
I really thought that was it.

1145
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:38,667
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo seem visibly nervous
at the announcement of Ha Ha's elimination.]

1146
01:12:39,412 --> 01:12:44,251
[Now remaining are 5:5.]

1147
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:48,555
[Flower Boy Crush Report-
What could be the survey's number one answer?]

1148
01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:58,526
This one...
I don't think this is it, do you?

1149
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:00,846
- No, I don't think so.
- I don't think so, right?

1150
01:13:00,847 --> 01:13:03,276
[The ball that Kang Joon recently found.]

1151
01:13:06,054 --> 01:13:07,936
Try putting it in there like that.

1152
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:13,376
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you trying to do to your leader?

1153
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:15,818
I don't think this is it.
This one doesn't make sense to me.

1154
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:17,794
- Trust me on this, this isn't it.
- Then put it in there.

1155
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:21,372
- We'll trust you if you'll put it in there.
- I'm telling you this isn't it.

1156
01:13:21,373 --> 01:13:22,836
But you still want me to put it in there?

1157
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:25,196
- But what if this is the correct answer?
- How am I the leader right now?

1158
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:28,368
- You're not the leader anymore.
- Have you guys been toying with me all day?

1159
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:31,274
What if the other team puts this in,
and they win the race?

1160
01:13:31,275 --> 01:13:34,787
- What if the other team wins with this?
- I'm positive that this isn't it.

1161
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:36,179
Seriously?

1162
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,944
How about we make someone else
put this one in there?

1163
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:40,635
How about Suk Jin?

1164
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,912
[Gary is chosen as their sacrificial lamb.]

1165
01:13:44,913 --> 01:13:47,292
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1166
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:50,780
No, I don't want to!

1167
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:54,644
Jong Kook, help!
No, I'm not doing this with my hand!

1168
01:13:55,758 --> 01:13:57,894
- Lift him up there.
- No, I don't want to!

1169
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:02,198
[Gary is forced to score
the ball in the net.]

1170
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:05,952
My hand didn't even touch the ball!

1171
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:10,424
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1172
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,878
[Captain Kwang Soo's dirty play.]

1173
01:14:15,172 --> 01:14:19,144
[Team Seniors loses another teammate
after first losing Ha Ha.]

1174
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,062
Ugh, I'm seriously so aggravated.

1175
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:27,232
This is seriously...
I'm not going to forget this one.

1176
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:33,308
[Only four more left to go...]

1177
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:37,405
If we hadn't found this one, then the other
team has too high of a chance at a win.

1178
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:40,098
If it's not this one,
then it has to be the other one.

1179
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:41,988
- Waiting around?
- It has to be waiting around.

1180
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:45,764
The toughest part has to be left
wondering and not knowing anything.

1181
01:14:45,765 --> 01:14:48,766
Even if you don't like the answer,
it's better to know where they stand.

1182
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:51,382
- I have to know whether I'm it or not.
- That's right.

1183
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,528
It's really annoying when
you're constantly left to wait around.

1184
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:56,192
That actually happened to me once.

1185
01:14:56,193 --> 01:14:59,548
They told me everything about the CF shoot
except for where it was getting filmed at.

1186
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,616
I knew the date and the time
the CF was going to get filmed

1187
01:15:02,617 --> 01:15:05,463
and they told me they'll see me in three days,
then I never heard from them again.

1188
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:06,738
[Totally left hanging.]

1189
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:09,306
[Some frustrating times...]

1190
01:15:09,307 --> 01:15:11,998
I was going to search through every single
studio in Gyungggi-Do district.

1191
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,638
I'm serious.

1192

[Joo Hyuk continues to search through
every nook and cranny.]

1193
01:15:20,244 --> 01:15:25,020
[Discovers another beach ball
in the freezer.]

1194
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:32,632
When they completely ignore me
while knowing of my crush on them.

1195
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:34,784
I think I'm doing a good job
of finding these balls.

1196
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:39,705
- What's that?
- There's a ball coming your way!

1197
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,599
Joo Hyuk has the ball!

1198
01:15:42,386 --> 01:15:47,209
[Score the ball with the number one answer
to immediately win the mission!]

1199
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:52,004
[There's no one by the goal post
on the first floor.]

1200
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:57,079
I think it's being ignored when they know
that I've got a crush on them.

1201
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,748
- That's what you think?
- That's what I think is the answer.

1202
01:15:58,749 --> 01:16:00,071
[Kwang Soo's number one answer.]

1203
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:03,912
[Could it really be the number one answer?]

1204
01:16:05,197 --> 01:16:07,874
[Dunks it in before he can change his mind.]

1205

1206
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:20,540
[If Kwang Soo's guess it also wrong...]

1207
01:16:20,656 --> 01:16:23,966
- This is your erasure chance.
- So this is not the answer?

1208
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:27,356
[The incorrect answer
that they got to see...]

1209
01:16:27,357 --> 01:16:29,182
I really thought this was it.

1210
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:36,793
[But the answer that
Ha Ha got eliminated for...]

1211
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,794
[Asking me for dating advice
while confessing feelings for someone else.]

1212
01:16:44,856 --> 01:16:50,146
[The answer that Gary was sacrificed for...]

1213
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,034
[When your crush is all you can think about.]

1214
01:16:53,038 --> 01:16:56,117
[When your crush is all you can think about.]

1215
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,230
<i>Completely ignoring me when
being fully aware of my crush on them.</i>

1216
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:06,785
<i>Nam Joo Hyuk, out.</i>

1217
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:11,140
[The likeliest answer of the three
answers that are still left remaining...]

1218
01:17:11,925 --> 01:17:15,073
[Could it be the ball that Jong Hyun
is holding in his hands?]

1219
01:17:16,737 --> 01:17:23,106
[The answer the 15 year old gave as being
the toughest part of crushing on someone.]

1220
01:17:23,674 --> 01:17:26,240

you're left waiting around.</i>

1221
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:31,522
[The ball that Jong Hyun just found...]

1222
01:17:33,851 --> 01:17:35,962
We have to get Jong Hyun.

1223
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:38,440
He's headed up to the second floor.

1224
01:17:39,442 --> 01:17:41,346
Come on, let's not do this.

1225
01:17:41,347 --> 01:17:44,769
- Get him!
- Come on, let's not do this.

1226
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,842
I need my teammates to get Jong Hyun!

1227
01:17:48,906 --> 01:17:52,856
[Will Jong Hyun score the ball first,
or will he be caught first?]

1228
01:17:52,857 --> 01:17:59,258
[Everything is riding on this one ball.]

[Jong Hyun successfully gets
the ball in the net.]

1230
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:09,526

All those seven things are tough.

1236
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:40,917
- Crushing on someone is hard.
- Everything about a crush is tough.

1237
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:44,472
- What's their winning prize?
- Haven't seen these rings in a while.

1238
01:18:44,473 --> 01:18:47,822
- Wow, these are nice.
- They look like class graduation rings.

1239
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,645
Captain, say something for us.

1240
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:53,662

- Fighting, fighting, fighting...

- Let's do it, too.
- On the count of three.

1242
