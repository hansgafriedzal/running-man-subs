00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:16,110
Running Man members have been
shooting for two days in a row.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,783
We have a sore throat.

8
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:21,133
Please understand that.

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:26,045
They are wearing sunglasses
to cover their faces.

10
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,184
Reveal it!

11
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:32,490
I think it's because they ate something
before they went to sleep.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,270
I think he needs to go see a doctor.
Seriously.

13
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:40,130
I don't know who the guests are
but they're all dead meat.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,320
[This song sounds familiar.]

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,525
Isn't it Super Junior's song?

[Is Hee Chul going to be here today?]

the members with a sign.]

is on Running Man!]

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,000

who appear on variety shows.]

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,852

on variety shows.]

27

[He's fully dressed as if he's going to
perform on the stage.]

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,925
- Am I overdressed?
- You look nice.

29
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,243
Why are you carrying your name?

30
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:34,470
This is my concept.

[One of the top girl groups,
4Minute's youngest member.]

variety show for the first time.]

45

[So Hyun is 22 years old now.]
- You're already 22?

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
- How old are you now, Ryeo Wook?
- I'm 29 yeas old.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,675
Is the age difference between
Kwang Soo and you only one year?

48
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,175
- No, it's two years.
- Am I older?

49
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:41,130
[How can you say that by
looking at Kwang Soo's face?]

50
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:45,369
- He looks very young.
- You look young, not him.

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,480
Who's next?

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,325

53
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,157
[The song is...]

54
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,150
BEAST!

Yoon Doo Joon?]

that came to Running Man is...]

[BEAST's Son Dong Woon.]

60
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,000
[There was a rumor about his wit.]

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,070
It’s very rare to see him
somewhere other than a stage.]

62
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,400
Dong Woon is an ambitious guy.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
[He wants close-ups.]

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,470
[He showed his ability to pick
the right spot on music programs.]

65
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,850
[The ambitious guy,
Dong Woon.]

66
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,069
- That ambition hasn't been revealed yet.
- He's handsome.

67
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,975
[He was hoping for others
to recognize his ambition.]

68
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:43,725
As I see the guests
coming out one by one

69
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,430
I can tell what kind of theme
we'll have today.

70
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,337
[They are the members of
popular groups but...]

71
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,700
[He can't really say it out loud.]

72
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,250
I have a feeling.

73
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,933
I know why they are
holding the signs.

74
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,471
I was doubtful when I saw Ryeo Wook
and So Hyun

75
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,554
but I'm pretty sure now
that Dong Woon came out.

76
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:08,670
<i>They're not really
representing their groups.</i>

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,060
Ryeo Wook thinks it's the
youngest members special.

78
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:15,051
He's saying we could be wrong.

79
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,360
[So Hyun and Dong Woon are also
the youngest of their groups.]

80
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,368
Let's see if Ryeo Wook
is right or if we're right.

81
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:28,390
[Youngest members' special
or the unnoticed members' special?]

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,975
[Let's see who comes next.]

83
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:34,145
[Infinite's song?]

84
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,350
[He's overacting
the moment he steps in.]

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,950
[I think we're right.]

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,750
[Infinite's Jang Dong Woo.]

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,225
[I'm the hidden gemstone of Infinite.]

88
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:04,320
I really like Infinite, but I've never
seen you on variety shows.

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,520
[He debuted five years ago, but it's his
first time on a Sunday variety show.]

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,950
- Are you the youngest in your group?
- No, I'm the second oldest!

91
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,000
[So, the theme is not
the youngest special.]

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,471
Are you the second oldest?
I'm the second oldest.

93
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm the second oldest, too.

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm the second child of my parents.

95
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
He's witty.

96
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,024
See? He has ambition.

97
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,840
[Today's theme is indeed,
the unnoticed idol members special!]

98
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,460
This is a really good idea.

99
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,725
There are lots of idol members but
we don't get to see them very often.

100
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,706
That's right.
We had no opportunities!

101
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:48,987
You should have been on variety shows
countless times already!

102
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,414
I wonder who will be the next?

103
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,510
[Girl's Day's song is being played.]

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,180
[Her ambitious
and cute dance moves.]

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,890
[Girl's Day's So Jin.]

106
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,275
[The leader of Girl's Day,
So Jin.]

107
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:13,340
[Now it's time to take
the lead on variety shows.]

108
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,950
I can feel the thirst
of all these idols.

109
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,720
[Their thirst for variety shows.]

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,850
- It's my first time seeing So Jin.
- Me, too.

111
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,900
I never knew there was such a pretty
and bright member in that group.

112
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,050
And we never saw her on variety shows.

113
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,570
I thinks she's the prettiest
Girl's Day member.

114
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,300
She is really pretty.

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,667
[It's a mystery that she hasn't
been on a variety show before.]

116
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,810
- Look how pretty So Hyun is.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,250
In 4Minute, there's Hyuna...

118
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,750
- Hyuna, Hyuna...
- Hyuna, and Hyuna.

119
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:55,760
In Super Junior,
there's Si Won, Leeteuk, Hee Chul...

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,126
No, no!
There's Ryeo Wook.

121
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:04,156
In Beast, there's
Ki Kwang, Doo Joon.

122
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:08,476
And Ki Kwang, and Ki Kwang.

123
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:14,086
In Infinite,
there's Sung Kyu, L, Sung Kyu.

124
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:18,380
In Girl's Day, there's Minah,
Hyeri, Minah, Hyeri.

125
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,070
- So Jin is right here.
[But I'm the leader.]

126
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,037
Now's the time to turn the tide over!

127
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,636
You know what today's theme is.

128
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:29,416
- We have more guests.
- We have more?

129
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,281
[Rare idols on a variety show,
the rarest idol is coming.]

130
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:36,745
- It's Teen Top!
- Niel is coming.

131
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:40,832
[He seems pretty chill.]

132
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,500
[Teen Top's Niel.]

133
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,040
Ryeo Wook and So Hyun
are very upset.

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,650
Because Niel is too
famous to be here.

135
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,741
He doesn't fit in.
He's the main vocalist.

136
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,919
He's not thirsty!

137
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,800
[Still, it's his first time
on Running Man.]

138
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,050
Teen Top is not that famous yet,
I want to promote my group.

139
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,450
[They've performed in 20 countries.]

140
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,445
[Teen Top is more popular
in foreign countries.]

141
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,191
[And Niel plays a leading part.]

142
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,190
He's somewhat similar to Kwang Soo.

143
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,350
People always say it to me.

144
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you glaring at me
when you say that?

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Niel and I were
in a TV commercial together.

146
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,412
[They were in a beverage commercial.]

147
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:33,145
He may look like Kwang Soo
but he's different.

148
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,060
- Thank you.
- What do you mean thank you?

149
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,800
They're all looking good.

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,720
[This time, a weird
gemstone is coming.]

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,325
[The overly ambitious, Eric Nam.]

152
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:53,558
- Ah, it's Eric Nam!
[He's even more excited.]

153
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:59,436
[Eric Nam]

154
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,220
[He's a great singer who was
a contestant of an audition program.]

155
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,575
[He's broadened his career as a reporter
especially for foreign celebrities.]

156
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:11,750
I know Eric (A Shinhwa member) though.

157
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,270
Ah, you were a contestant
of an audition program?

158
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes!

159
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,878
I'm sorry but I've never
heard his song before.

160
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:23,432
I've heard his name a lot,
but not his song.

161
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,085
- He looks mature.
- I'm 28 years old.

162
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:33,441
[Someone is running
with lightning fast speed.]

163
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,122
[Which group is he from?]

164
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:39,051
BtoB!

165
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,220
[Is he dancing to the song 'Beep Beep'?]

166
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,700
[He's ambitious, too.]

167
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,011
[BtoB's Min Hyuk]

168
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,880
[BtoB's rapper
and a very athletic idol.]

169
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,975
He's really good at sports.

170
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,196
You can see him twice a year.

171
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,830
[Field day specials are on
New year's day and Thanksgiving day.]

172
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,270
I'm getting teary here.

173
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,175
[There aren't many opportunities
for them to show their talents.]

174
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,522
[The last guest]

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,440
[From the way he walks,
he looks unique.]

176
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,575
He's the leader of VIXX, N.

177
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,980
[The hottest group
amongst idol groups, VIXX!]

178
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:33,260
[I lead the way of VIXX!]

179
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,365
VIXX is the hottest group
amongst teenagers.

180
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,424
You're praising yourself?

181
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,947
[Very ambitious introduction.]
- We know VIXX.

182
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:44,130
Let's welcome them.

183
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,950
Welcome!

184
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,616
[They are rarely seen
on variety shows.]

185
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,800
[Finding the Hidden Gemstones Race.]

186
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,870
I'm actually in charge of
variety shows in my group.

187
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,010
Is that true?

188
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,890
I've been DJ'ing for a radio show
for more than three years.

189
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,170
And I've been MC'ing on a cable channel
for more than a year.

190
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:06,810
You have?

191
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:10,332
- He's the Yoo Jae Suk of cable TV.
- Is that so?

192
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:14,417
Just how many Yoo Jae Suks
are there on cable channels?

193
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,455
That's why I can't air
on cable channels.

194
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:21,148
Because there are too many
Yoo Jae Suks?

195
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:25,117
When you arrived here,
did you get the feel of today's theme?

196
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,594
- Yes, I did.
[It's an ambition special.]

197
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:30,777
So Hyun, who made you
think that the most?

198
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:33,793
When I saw Eric Nam.

199
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:38,186
I'm Eric Nam.
Please treat me favorably.

200
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:41,019
I envy you.

201
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:46,442
So Jin, who do you think fit
to this theme the most?

202
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:48,789
Ryeo Wook.

203
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,116
[He's shocked.]

204
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:54,354
[I'm sorry.]

205
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,389
She's older than me.

206
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,483
- Really?
- Are you serious?

207
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:03,078
- How old are you?
- I'm thirty.

208
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,050
[It doesn't make sense.]

209
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,790
So Jin is 30?

210
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:14,034
She looks so young.
She looks like she's 23.

211
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,644
[The new icon of baby face, So Jin.]

212
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,343
- This is the beginning.
[The warming up is over.]

213
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,340
Why are you covering me?

214
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,410
I should be on the screen
as much as possible!

215
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,431
Why is everyone so sensitive?

216
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,620
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,870
[Everyone wants to be on screen
as many times as possible.]

218
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,576
Be confident, everyone.

219
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,198
You are the true gemstones
of variety shows.

220
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,987
What you're saying
makes us feel smaller.

221
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:47,476
[Agreeing.]

222
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:51,861
Why would you say that?

223
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:54,364
You said this is
a hidden gemstone special

224
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:57,127
but I'm already becoming a jewel...

225
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,825
[N's whimsical reply.]

226
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:03,536
[We can tell he is prepared.]

227
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:09,477
He needs to change his name from 'N' to
'This guy' as in 'What's with this guy?'

228
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:13,435
- And I'm the leader of my group...
- You're the group leader?

229
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:19,388
the best dancer, a pretty good singer,
and also in charge of sexiness.

230
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:21,429
Is he a narcissist?

231
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:27,402
It's true. I'm also in the drama
'The Family is Coming'.

232
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,719
- With So Jin.
-That's right.

233
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,153
- Then you should know each other well.
- We have a love connection.

234
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:37,486
N is very proud of it
and So Jin seems to be shy.

235
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:41,140
It's because I'm not divorced yet.

236
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,580
[She feels awkward admitting their affair
since she's a married woman in the drama.]

237
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,367
[How would their relationship be
on Running Man?]

238
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,991
[Managers]
[Idols]

239
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:55,756
[Team Red] [Team Pink]
[Team White] [Team Blue]

240
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:58,560
The missions for
the 'Job Well Done Race' are

241
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,470
the games that are picked
by the guests.

242
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,880
They picked the games from the previous
races of Running Man earlier.

243
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,990
- We met earlier.
- Really?

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,450
According to the result of each mission

245
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,299
you will get a gold bar
with a 'Job Well Done' stamp.

246
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,320
The team that gets the most
gold bars will be the winner

247
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
and only the winner can
actually take the gold bars.

248
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,820
Managers, please help your
team members.

249
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,375
[We'll now start the Finding
Hidden Gemstone Race!]

250
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,190
What do you usually do
when you're home, Dong Woon?

251
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,390
I stay in bed.

252
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,175
- I like to light up a scented candle...
- A scented candle?

253
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:48,599
It's my healing therapy.
Not that I need it...

254
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,799
Even before you debuted...
So Hyun says she's 22 now.

255
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,999
Didn't you debut when you
were 16?

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,699
I was 16 when I joined 4Minute.

257
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,290
- Were you doing something before then?
- I was on SBS's True Game once.

258
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't think you remember me
because I was in elementary school.

259
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,700
[A kid from a dance competition grew up
and became a member of 4Minute.]

260
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,799
Ryeo Wook, you're not very active.

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm better at talk shows.

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,899
I told Hee Chul and Dong Hae
that I'm going to be on Running Man.

263
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,090
But they didn't believe me.

264
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,299
So I said 'It's real!'.

265
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,250
Then Dong Hae said "Why you?"

266
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,920
- Dong Hae should come, too.
- We need to introduce Dong Hae, too.

267
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,700
There are so many people
we need to introduce.

268
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,090
[Arriving at the first mission site.]

269
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,050
What game is this? It looks like
we're in the middle of a rice field.

270
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,390
- What is it?
- Is it the mudflat?

271
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,099
[It's in the middle of winter.
It can't be a mud game..]

272
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,600
[Shiny mudflat on a winter day.]

273
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,599
[Who picked the game
that will be played here?]

274
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,299
- Let's get out.
[They're smiling upon arrival.]

275
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,799
[They're smiling upon their arrival.]

276
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,699
You can go that way.

277
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,799
[How will their first
experience at a mudflat be?]

278
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,120
[It's their first time seeing wetsuits.]

279
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,100
Eric, pick a pretty one quickly.

280
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,699
There are name tags on them.

281
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,299
- Do I just wear one?
- Yes, Ryeo Wook.

282
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,399
[Rule no.1 :No one's going to help you.]
- Where do I put my shoe lifts?

283
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,799
[Rule no.2 : Boots are a must,
shoe lifts are optional.]

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,999
Remove your mic.

285
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,999
[Rule no.3 : Remove your mic.]
- You know what it means?

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,299
It means your whole body
will get wet.

287
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,899
I've never worn this before.

288
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,899
Niel, I told you
not to make a scene like this.

289
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,852
[The Managers know
it from their experiences.]

290
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,799
[Finally, it's time to get in.]
- Gather with your team members.

291
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,199
- Eric, Niel!
[It's hard to make a move for them.]

292
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,370
[It's hard to make a move for them.]

293
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,050
- Come on, guys.
- Ryeo Wook!

294
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,175
Try and get the close-up scene.

295
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:19,170
<i>They love the mudflat.</i>

296
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,325
Thanks to Min Hyuk, we're all here.

297
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:25,499
Thank you, Min Hyuk.

298
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,590
[At the meeting earlier,
Min Hyuk wrote mudflat game.]

299
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,890
The first game will be
'One Heart and Mind on the Mudflat'.

300
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,099
All four team members
will start running at the same time.

301
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,099
When you hear a loud pop,
huge work pants will shoot out.

302
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,199
You should try and grab the pants,
then all four members get in the pants.

303
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,399
You see the flags with an R mark?

304
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,900
There is a rubber mat at the finish line.

305
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,800
All four of you have to be
on the board.

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,550
Ryeo Wook doesn't exercise.

307
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,525
And he doesn't understand
the game instructions.

308
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:10,600
Managers, please explain the game.

309
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,650
Go to the starting line, everyone.

310
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,400
[The first mission has begun.]

311
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,390
Can I help you, So Jin?

312
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,599
[Giraffe is reaching out to help her.]

313
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,420
Do you have a boyfriend, So Jin?

314
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,400
He's flirting over there.

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,075
What are you talking about?

316
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,099
- Anyone can tell.
- That's what I'm saying.

317
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,990
- I'm a bit nervous all of a sudden.
- Why?

318
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,499
- Don't be nervous!
- Be nervous!

319
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,099
I won't blow a whistle
but you will hear the pop.

320
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,299
Then you will see a pair of
pants shoot out.

321
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:02,099
In a bit, another pair of pants will shoot
out, and there will be 4 pants in total.

322
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,825
Get ready!

323
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:07,399
[First round of 'One heart
and mind on the mudflat'.]

324
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,675
[First pair of pants are flying.]

325
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,150
[Surprised.]

326
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,220
[Running at full speed for the pants.]

327
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,220
[Min Hyuk grabbed it.]

328
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,100
[Three team members
are chasing after the pants.]

329
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,990
[Indoor style entertainer Ryeo Wook
hasn't adjusted to the mudflats yet.

330
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,599
[Min Hyuk is dodging pretty well.]

331
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,900
[This is the proper way to play.]

332
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,400
[Right then, the second pair
of pants shoot out.]

333
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,499
[All four team members
follow the trace of the pants.]

334
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,599
[The work pants come first.]

335
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,399
[She's learning the game
with every fiber of her body.]

336
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,199
[Third pants shoot out.]

337
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,025
It's right there.

338
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:12,375
[Team Red and Team Blue
are after the third pair of pants.]

339
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,200
[In the meantime, Team Pink gets the pants.]

340
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,125
[Team White is starting to wear one.]

341
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,990
[Team Red and Team Blue
are still fighting over the pants.]

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,800
[The last pants shoot out.]

343
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,370
[Niel quickly grabs the pants.]

344
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,700
[All the teams get one pair of pants each.]

345

[They need to wear them
and get to the finish line.]

346
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,100
[All other teams are starting
to wear their pants.]

347
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,500
The first team to wear the pants
and stand on the board wins.]

348
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,699
[Slapstick comedy happens more
when they're in a hurry.]

349
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,399
[Pink team is wearing the pants
without any interruptions.]

350
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,550
[We can't let them wear it so peacefully!]

351
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,900
[Jae Suk and Dong Woon attack them.]

352
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,390
[Kwang Soo is interrupting his own team.]

353
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,599
[While the three teams struggle...]

354
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,999
[Team White is advancing.]

355
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,299

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,925
[First round winner, Team White.]

360
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:51,999
Everyone lost their energy
only after one round.

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,299
[I envy them... they are
escaping from the mudflat.]

362
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,799
[The winner of the first round can
sit back and watch the others.]

363
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,499
Min Hyuk is certainly fast.

364
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:13,499
Min Hyuk, why did you pick this game?
It's so cold here!

365
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,600
It was a good choice!
An excellent choice!

366
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,250
[The three teams go back
to the starting line.]

367
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,590
We're empty-handed.

368
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,370
They're not here any more, so
we can show what we can do now.

369
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,750
- Our team has good members.
- So this is how the mudflat is.

370
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,250
So this is how the mudflat is.

371
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,490
I'm very happy and satisfied.
I had enough fun.

372
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,299
I hope other people can feel
the happiness now.

373
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,299
- We can take a break now?
- Let's watch them now.

374
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:50,099
- It's all because of So Hyun.
- Why?

375
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,000
By the way, Niel...

376
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,799
Your face is too clean.
You're even cleaner than So Jin.

377
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,099
[Running Man members are teaching
him what a variety show is about.]

378
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,599
[Exploring the mudflat with Niel's face.]

379
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,599
[He gave up his beauty for his team.]

380
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,999
Niel, you're going to make
Teen Top famous today.

381
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,890
[If I can promote Teen Top...]

382
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,900
You have the most clean face
in your team now.

383
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:35,590
- It's all dried up.
- Ji Suk Jin! Ji Suk Jin!

384
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,399
[Washing up his face with mud.]

385
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,899
[Styling his hair with mud.]

386
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:53,599
[He's having a mud feast.]

387
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,250
[Team Blue is playing
the human domino chain.]

388
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,900
[Niel is perfectly adjusted
to the mudflat.]

389
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,450
Are you okay, Niel?
He's doing a good job.

390
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:14,275
[The fairy of the mudflat,
why did you come so late?]

391
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,290
It feels refreshing.

392
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,499
I didn't know it would be
nice out here in the winter.

393
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,899
-I know, right?
- I thought it would be just cold.

394
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,650
Ryeo Wook, how would you feel
if you were standing there?

395
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,590
It would be frustrating.
I guess I felt refreshing because we won.

396
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,270
Now I can enjoy the sight.

397
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,770
Now you know why people like
mudflats so much.

398
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:46,799
[Second Round]

399
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,399
- Dong Woon!
- Yes, Captain!

400
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,599
Let's do it!

401
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,000
[The winning team
will be able to take a break.]

402
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,790
We don't know when it will start.

403
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,390
[Get the pants as quick as you can
and get to the finish line.]

404
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,250
[Dong Woon catches them
as he dives into the mud.]

405
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,499
[The other team members pounce on him.]

406
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,699
[The second pants shoot out.]

407
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,999
[Niel's nice catch.]

408
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,900
[But he gets thrown right away.]

409
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,400
[Big-nose was on his way
to help him but blocked by So Hyun.]

410
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,899
[In the meantime,
N could get the pants easily.]

411
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,299
[The last pants shoot out.]

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,250
- It's right there.
- It's like we're watching a football game.

413
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,375
[Wherever the pants land,
it turns into a madhouse.]

414
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:59,900
[Team Pink gets together
to wear the pants.]

415
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,216
[Stop the Team Pink.]

416
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,850
[Niel is on his way.]

417
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:11,190
[He was on his way for a
slapstick routine.]

418
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,350
It's so funny.

419
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,700
Who is this game for?

420
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,770
What is this?

421
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,775
You can't even see the
faces of the guests.

422
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:32,099
Are you sure this game
was picked for idols?

423
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,550
[No matter what, I will be
the main character today!]

424
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,025
I never knew that pants were
that stretchy before.

425
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:45,199
They don't rip.

426
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:51,590
[So Hyun gets the pants.]

427
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,425
[Team Pink is almost done
wearing the pants.]

428
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:58,999
[Eric Nam is blocking it
with all his strength.]

429
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,599
[Stop Team Pink.]

430
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,070
[Those two in front passed
the finish line.]

431
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,390
[They tried to stop N and So Jin.]

432
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
[Team Pink finally pass it.]

433
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,825
<i>Team Pink won.</i>

434
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,499
- Mommy!
[We miss our mothers at times like these.]

435
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,699
Who was it?
Who picked this game? Min Hyuk!

436
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,750
[Who... are you?]

437
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,975
This time, it will be a real mud fight.

438
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:43,090
Only one team will be left.

439
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,290
I might be swearing.
Bear with it.

440
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,020
We're really upset.

441
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,090
We have the first and second winner,
so only the third place is left.

442
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,990
Big-nosed Brother, aren't you cold?
I'll give you a muffler.

443
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,999
It's much better.

444
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,899
This is so warm.

445
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,699
Thanks, Jae Suk.

446
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,400
Who's that?

447
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,100
[Who are you?]

448
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,299
[An organism resembling
Eric Nam is approaching.]

449
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:17,425
[We find another one who might be Niel.]

450
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:21,599
[The first and second winners
are watching them together.]

451
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,599
[The final round]

452
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,075
[Team Red vs. Team Blue-
Who will be the last winner?]

453
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,699
[Two pants shoot out at the same time.]

454
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,999
[Struggles for both pair of pants.]

455
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,050
It looks like a war
when I watch it from here.

456
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,750
I was doing that?

457
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,190
- It's so much fun to watch.
- They don't look like humans anymore.

458
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:01,990
[Kwang Soo takes the pants
and runs away.]

459
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,699
[How far are you going to go?]

460
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,590
Why are you running so far?

461
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,400
Just stop it!

462
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,050
You will go all the way to China.

463
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,190
[He's about the cross the West Sea.]

464
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,899
I don't want to live this way!

465
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,570
What are we doing in the
middle of winter?

466
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,300
[Just come back.]

467
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,270
Kwang Soo, I'll go first.

468
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,700
[Where are you going?]

469
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,425
[Let's go together.]

470
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:14,325
[Endless duel of the two men.]

471
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,499

472
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,925

[He's showing what variety is
about with his whole body.]

474
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,600
Wear your pants!

475
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,999
[Both teams start to wear the pants.]

476
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,850
[Who's faster?]

477
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:06,550
[The team who gets first
is the last winner.]

478
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,890
[The finish line was so close.]

479
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,100
[Team Blue wins the third round.]

480
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,225
[Exhausted]

481
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,800
[The red team lost by an inch.]

482
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,475
Don't look!

483
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,425
[Kwang Soo's pantless fashion
will be remembered forever.]

484
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,975
[Team White gets three gold bars.]

485
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,075
<i>The second winner gets two gold bars.]</i>

486
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,275
- Get off!
- I'm Niel.

487
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,770
[He camouflaged to get
the gold bars.]

488
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,550
[Team Blue gets one gold bar.]

489
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,301
[The first mission is over.]

490

[Running News
Niel, trades his looks for his talent.]

491
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,965
[So Hyun's desire for winning
surprises Mr. Capable!]

492
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,670
We'll include washing up
as a special mission.

493
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,190
The team who washes up the fastest
will get a gold bar.

494
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,299
[He is Eric Nam (not a beast).]

495
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:40,590
I'm not a monster.

496
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,099
Do they have a shower
for everyone?

497
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,599
[It's time to get myself back.]

498
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,899
Do you have a change of clothes?

499
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:57,375
Stop filming!
That's enough!

500
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,999
I've been looking like this
the whole time?

501
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,925
[After a short while...]

502
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,920

- Ha Ha!
- Where are you?

508
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,100
So Hyun!
Let me do the make up for you!

509
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,650
- Girls don't answer at all.
- Seriously?

510
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,999
- So Hyun!
- No one replies.

511
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,699
[We can't get in.]
- So Jin!

512
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:53,700
[Dong Woo returns as a flower boy.]

513
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,575
- Where is Dong Woon?
- I haven't seen him.

514
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,899
Why are you blocking the way?

515
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,525
- Are you leaving now?
- Of course, I am.

516
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,520
- No, you're not.
- Move your car.

517
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,175
How come I don't see any of my team members?

518
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:15,899
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- He's here!

519
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:18,425
Stop him!

520
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,699
- Get out!
- Are you going to date me or not?

521
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,899
[Gary's playing hard to get.]

522
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,499
Where do I need to go?

523
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,499
[All the members of Team Blue are here.]

524
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,550
[Team Red tries to get in the blue car.]

525
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,799
[Right then, all the
members of Team Red arrive.]

526
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,399
- Is Team White here?
- Hey, you're team is all out.

527
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,599
What's going on?

528
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,799
What are you doing?

529
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:03,325
[Dong Woo is carrying Kwang Soo
on his shoulders and taking him away.]

530
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,899
[N is interrupting Team Red.]
- Jae Suk!

531
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:20,099
[Kwang Soo gets in the car
without one of his shoes.]

532
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,799
Team Blue wins!

533
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Feel! Sense! Niel! Eric! Cross!

534
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,690
[Team Blue gets an additional gold bar.]

535
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,899
Think how hard it was to get a
gold bar at the mudflat.

536
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:56,175
[Kyeyang Library in Incheon]

537
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,499
- What is it?
- Hello!

538
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,699
I think it's the name tag elimination.

539
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:14,299
It looks like a prison cell.

540
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,399
It's the name tag elimination.

541
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,099
[They've heard a lot about it.
Worried and excited at the same time.]

542
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,999
[Team White, Ryeo Wook is pretty slow.]

543
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,299
[Today's name tag elimination is different.]

544
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,825
[There's no hidden spot.]

545
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:44,899
Before we start, I have something to say.
Kwang Soo stole one of our gold bars.

546
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,800
I understand he wanted to take it
but stealing is wrong!

547
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,699
[This is what Kwang Soo stole.]

548
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,299
That gold bar belongs to us,
why are you hesitating so much?

549
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,220
- Say, 'please'.
- What did you say?

550
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,590
- Say, 'please'.
- Then don't.

551
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,225
Give him.
What are you doing?

552
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,950
[It seems very important.]

553
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,500
[The case is terminated peacefully.]

554
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,350
By the way,
please don't let Gary wear pink.

555
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,700
[Gary in pink makes people's eyes hurt.]

556
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,420
- Please, don't.
- I'm depressed all day long.

557
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,420
I have to play the name tag elimination
but I don't look strong at all.

558
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:43,920
Amongst all the guests, Dong Woo,
Dong Woon, Eric Nam, and N

559
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,900
wanted to play the name tag
elimination game.

560
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:56,190
This time, the name tag elimination to win
against Running Man will be 1 versus 3.

561
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,899
Each team has a representing
team member.

562
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,775
Yoo Jae Suk, Kim Jong Kook,
Lee Kwang Soo, and Gary.

563
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:14,490
- These 4 people are the representatives.
- Suk Jin is not?

564
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,800
I expected to hear my name.

565
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,100
[Big-nose spirit:
Always greedy for positions.]

566
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:31,400
We picked the representatives
by their winning rate.

567
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,450
Yoo Jae Suk, Kim Jong Kook, Lee Kwang Soo
and Gary are the representatives.

568
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,575
Let's say the three members
except Yoo Jae Suk

569
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:47,500
pick another team's representative.

570
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,700
If they pick Kim Jong Kook,
they have to play with Kim Jong Kook.

571
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,099
If they succeed eliminating
Kim Jong Kook's name tag

572
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,674
depending on the time it takes,
the fastest to succeed wins.

573
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,100
Three of you can do it, so be careful.

574
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,499
If Kim Jong Kook eliminates
all three members' name tags

575
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,199
this team will be ousted.

576
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,800
It's very difficult to eliminate
three name tags.

577
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,599
We'll draw from the team
who arrived first.

578
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,199
We have no choice.

579
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,799
I'm getting nervous.

580
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,099
Pick one.

581
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,799
- Pick one...
- But they are not good at it.

582
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,899
- But Ji Hyo is good at it.
-Yes, you have Ji Hyo.

583
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,599
[Min Hyuk picked one.]
- You guys have one Running Man member.

584
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,999
Then let's see
who Team White picked.

585
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,199
[Kwang Soo? Jae Suk? Gary?]

586
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,499
[Gary]

587
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,615
[Gary of the Pink Team is chosen.]

588
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,221
Song Ji Hyo's on that team.

589
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,570
[Fate's cruel joke?
Monday Couple to face off.]

590
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:12,070
Ji Hyo always texts me
after the show.

591
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:15,408
- These two are really...
- When did I ever do that?

592
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,569
[Really?]

593
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,324
- Ji Hyo being on that team...
[How long will it take to eliminate Gary?]

594
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:26,074
White Team is pretty weak when
you take Jong Kook out of the equation.

595
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,757
[Rule- The representative of each team
is unable to participate in the game.]

596
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,513
- Ryeo Wook, you have to do a good job.
- Fighting!

597
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:34,588
- He kept saying he'll get it done quickly.
[Ryeo Wook makes Jong Kook nervous.]

598
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:37,321
[Gary vs Ji Hyo, Ryeo Wook, and Min Hyuk.]

599
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:44,745
Take it easy, okay?

600
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,445
- We're getting started, right?
[These two seem extremely nervous.]

601
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:52,136
- Gary, you may get started.
- What do we do!

602
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:56,304
What are you going to do?
He's no joke as an opponent.

603
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:58,681
- He's really scary, isn't he?
- That's right.

604
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:02,592
[Gary goes up to the second floor.]

605
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,362
- Gary is up on the second floor.
- Gary will go up to the third floor.

606
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:10,166
- There he goes right now.
- It's instinctive to go up to the top.

607
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:14,845
He says it's instinctive to go to
the end. He's so scary.

608
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:20,402
[Looking for a place to hide.]
- Rather than getting caught while hiding...

609
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:27,057
[Decides to wait in the stairwell between
the second and the third floor instead.]

610
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:31,501
[Ryeo Wook and Min Hyuk test out their
walkie-talkies for the first time.]

611
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:33,740
- You'll get started in 15 seconds.
- Can you hear me?

612
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,177
I can't hear anything.
Do I press this button?

613
00:41:36,178 --> 00:41:38,947
You have to press down
on the button while you talk.

614
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:41,259
[With the big battle looming ahead,
they get a quick lesson from Blank Ji.]

615
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,840
- Okay, I got it.
- Can you hear me?

616
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:47,096
- Can you hear me?
- Ryeo Wook is really weak in strength.

617
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:50,009
He couldn't even rip off the name tag
of his own strength.

618
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,794
- Seriously, he couldn't rip it off.
- They're like a flock of sheep.

619
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:57,779
[Gentle sheep full of fright...
Will they be able to get the job done?]

620
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,472
[Gary vs White Team.
Start the name tag elimination!]

621
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:05,414
- Let's go up to the third floor.
- I'm going up to the third floor.

622
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:09,401
- Hey, you can't leave me alone like this!
- Just start searching for him.

623
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:12,995
I'm going to get really scared
if I run into him on my own.

624
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:22,632
[Fearful Ryeo Wook gets startled by the VJ.]
- Why is he so fearful? This is bad.

625
00:42:24,636 --> 00:42:26,588
[What are you doing, Ryeo Wook?]

626
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:31,784
[Gary is waiting in the stairwell
by the third floor lobby.]

627
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:35,832
What's this?

628
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:39,068
[Gary is discovered!]

629
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,866
Ji Hyo!

630
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,033
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

631
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:50,404
[Gary is found! It's only a matter
of time before he's surrounded.]

632
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,701
[Gary is surrounded by all three
in the third floor lobby.]

633
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:56,441
- Ryeo Wook is chasing after him.
- Gary shouldn't be running away.

634
00:42:56,442 --> 00:42:59,405
Ryeo Wook, don't go after him.
Ryeo Wook!

635
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:05,372
[Gary vs Ji Hyo.
All eyes are on the fight.]

636
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:13,419
Let's grab him.

637
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:20,922
[Instead, Gary is the one to
grab Ryeo Wook!]

638
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,381
[Luckily survives the attack
with Ji Hyo's help.]

639
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:27,349
- Focus! Just stay still.
- Wow, he's amazing.

640
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,214
Why aren't you focusing?

641
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:31,057
[Busy taking care of
high maintenance Ryeo Wook.]

642
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,939
- Ji Hyo's acting as the commander.
[White Team's commander, Blank Ji.]

643
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:38,194
Why is Ryeo Wook standing so far away?
[Scaredy cat, Ryeo Wook, stays far away.]

644
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,682
- What they're doing isn't easy.
- The clock is still ticking.

645
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:45,473
[The clock keeps on ticking...]
- They got him!

646
00:43:45,474 --> 00:43:47,825
You have to grab him!

647
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,818
[But Gary quickly escapes
from their clutches.]

648
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,757
- Wow, Gary's good.
- This isn't easy for Gary, either.

649
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,768
[Muscly Min Hyuk desperately attempts
to maintain his grip on Gary.]

650
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,907
[But he almost loses his own
name tag in his attempt.]

651
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,955
How are we going to eliminate him?

652
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:04,960
Someone has to grab him
even if one must be sacrificed.

653
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:08,163
- They have to go against him.
- They have to grab his arms.

654
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:10,640
Wasting their time like that is useless.

655
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:14,469
[Successfully pushes Gary into a corner.]

656
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,459
[Min Hyuk pins down his arms!]

657
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:19,318
[Ace Ji Hyo jumps in!]

658
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:34,103
[White Team successfully eliminates Gary.]

659
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,409
- Kang Gary.
- I was seriously terrified.

660
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:43,230
[How long did it take the White Team
to eliminate Gary's name tag?]

661
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:45,757
Ugh, I'm tired.

662
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,379
[The time it took for the elimination
will soon be revealed.]

663
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,560
- Gary, it was like something out of a movie.
- Wow, that was great.

664
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:57,406
Gary, you did great.
Guys, you did great, too.

665
00:44:57,407 --> 00:45:00,550
You did better than I had expected.
I thought you'd get eliminated instead.

666
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,129
I thought you guys were
going to be eliminated.

667
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,047
You guys did much better
than I had expected.

668
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:10,603
It's time to determine whom
the Blue Team will go up against.

669
00:45:10,604 --> 00:45:12,759
- One member can come up and choose.
- We get to draw?

670
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,901
- It'll be Ji Suk Jin...
- I'll go and draw.

671
00:45:15,902 --> 00:45:19,888
- This team won't be easy, either.
- Choose wisely, okay?

672
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:22,564
- You'd better not choose Jong Kook, okay?
- He already made his selection.

673
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:25,417
- Hand me what you have chosen.
- It had better be Jae Suk.

674
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,553
I have a feeling that it's Jong Kook.

675
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:31,100
[A fifty-fifty chance.
Yoo Hyuk vs Mr. Capable.]

676
00:45:31,101 --> 00:45:33,764
- Please let it be Jae Suk.
- I think it's Jong Kook.

677
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,167
[Despair]

678
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:50,004
[Kim Jong Kook vs
Suk Jin, Niel, and Eric Nam.]

679
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:53,372
Since they're all males,
at least I don't have to be careful.

680
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:55,734
- Ugh, what a relief.
- It's such a relief.

681
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:58,238
I'm going to show everyone
what I'm made of.

682
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,667
[Is that right?
Then shall we get started?]

683
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:02,762
[Mr. Capable vs Suk Jin, Niel, and Eric Nam.]

684
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:07,215
I'm not even kidding when I tell you
that Jong Kook is seriously no joke.

685
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:11,467
[Don't fall for that easy going smile...]

686
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:15,120
- We're determined, too.
- Yes, we're very determined.

687
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:18,509
[Blue Team, fighting!]

688
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,697
Since there are three
males on the Blue Team

689
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:24,761
they're more difficult as an opponent
when they're on the defense.

690
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:28,893
But Jong Kook is the most difficult
target to attack for any team.

691
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:33,164
It really is a battle of
strength this time.

692
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,927
I really can't stand how Jong Kook is
strutting around like that and acting cocky.

693
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:39,224
I know what you mean.
His overconfident strut, right?

694
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:41,601
[One man's fearless stroll.]

695
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,385
There's nowhere to even hide.

696
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:48,973
[Then how should I do this?]

697
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,536
You can't help but want to flee
when you see Jong Kook.

698
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,866
- Should I not run away even if I'm alone?
- Run away if you're alone.

699
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:57,504
Scream out his location
as you run away from him.

700
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,062
But if two or more of us are together,
then we have to attack him.

701
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:03,552
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Suk Jin.

702
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:07,810
- This is no joke. This is for real.
- This is really happening, isn't it?

703
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:12,385
- You're facing off with Kim Jong Kook.
- Why did I draw that slip of paper?

704
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:19,065
[Time to let go of your regrets...
and face the battle!]

705
00:47:19,677 --> 00:47:21,858
- Just pin down both his arms.
- His arms?

706
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,689
- Ready, go!
- Let's go!

707
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,640
[Jong Kook vs The Blue Team-
Start the name tag elimination.]

708
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:33,929
[Mr. Capable is waiting for them
at the top of the stairs!]

709
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,102
[Come and get me.]

710
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:44,167
[Why is he using the walkie-talkie
when they're all standing together?]

711
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,505
[You're not getting past me
on these steps.]

712
00:47:47,506 --> 00:47:51,349
- They're running up to him.
- There they go!

713
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,639
Why aren't they going?

714
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,537
- I bet that's really scary.
- They can't keep stalling time like that.

715
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,360
He's using the elevation
to his advantage.

716
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:07,382
Being in a tight and elevated spot like that
could be advantageous for Jong Kook.

717
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:10,342
But they have to
push their way in right now.

718
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:13,314
- There you go!
- There they go.

719
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:16,760
[Chooses to face off with
Jong Kook head-on.]

720
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,287
[The imminent face-off.]

721
00:48:19,288 --> 00:48:22,197
Running away isn't going to
do us any good right now.

722
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:24,959
[Decides to forge ahead
under Big-nose's orders.]

723
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,512
[Mr. Capable is surrounded
on all three sides!]

724
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:37,862
[A tight battle of strength.]

725
00:48:37,863 --> 00:48:40,135
Battling three at once
isn't easy even for Jong Kook.

726
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:42,326
[All eyes are focused on
the action scene on screen.]

727
00:48:43,126 --> 00:48:44,835
Don't back down.

728
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,142
[Big-nose attacks,
but is thwarted to attack Eric Nam.]

729
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,820
[Okay, my name tag is still
on my back.]

730
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:03,905
[The name tag]
- He ripped off Niel's tag!

731
00:49:05,345 --> 00:49:07,596
[In the blink of an eye, Niel is ousted!]

732
00:49:07,597 --> 00:49:09,808
- What just happened?
- You just got ousted.

733
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:15,486
[One shot, one kill.
This is the power of Mr. Capable.]

734
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:17,254
He just ousted Niel.

735
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,315
[It is now one vs two.]

736
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,462
Don't let him get his hands on you.

737
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:31,830
[Big-nose gets his hands
on Jong Kook's name tag!]

738
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:35,409
[Will Big-nose succeed in
ripping off Mr. Capable's name tag?]

739
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,035
[Big-nose rips it off!]

740
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:42,430
[Big-nose successfully eliminates
Mr. Capable's name tag!]

741
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,602
- Wow, he did it!
- Wow, he eliminated him!

742
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,375
Suk Jin ripped it off!

743
00:49:49,957 --> 00:49:52,062
[How can this be?]

744
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,737
Big-nose did it!

745
00:49:57,475 --> 00:49:59,960
I pretty much had him.

746
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:03,831
- But I was caught by the door.
- Okay!

747
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:08,411
[Just how long did it take The Blue Team
to accomplish their mission?]

748
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:10,960
[A standing ovation.]

749
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:14,123
- Wow, Suk Jin.
- Destiny is meant to be changed.

750
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,495
[It's been a long while since the victor
and the loser has swapped roles.]

751
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,970
- I eliminated him rather quickly.
- Wow, that was impressive.

752
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:25,413
- Why aren't you cheering for me?
- I can't believe that just happened.

753
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:26,989
[Big-nose, you did an amazing job!]

754
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,356
You pretty much sacrificed Eric Nam,
and eliminated Jong Kook on your own.

755
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:32,079
[Bait, Eric Nam and Big-fish,
Big-nose's perfect teamwork.]

756
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,951
- I thought I had this one in the bag
- I thought we had this one, too.

757
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:37,562
[Overconfidence led to his loss.]

758
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:40,503
Then we'll be facing off
against Jae Suk, won't we?

759
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,373
- Then I have to go in?
- Fighting.

760
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,728
[Yoo Jae Suk, fighting!]

761
00:50:44,729 --> 00:50:46,983
- Fighting!
[I will get that gold bar.]

762
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:50,114
[Yoo Jae Suk vs Ha Ha, So Jin, and N.]

763
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,375
[Runs up to the library
on the second floor.]

764
00:50:55,992 --> 00:50:58,158
Come in.

765
00:50:58,159 --> 00:50:59,888
Ready, set, go!

766
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,684
[Jae Suk vs The Pink Team.
Start the name tag elimination.]

767
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,963
Where is he?
Where did he go?

768
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,946
We have to find him.
I wonder if he's up here?

769
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:16,353
[Number one common mistake by newbies-
Staying together in a group.]

770
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:19,449
Is he hiding?
I'm going to check upstairs.

771
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,459
[Ha Ha goes off to the third floor.]

772
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:24,691
I doubt that he'd be in here.

773
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:30,013
[Number two common mistake by newbies-
Not searching thoroughly enough.]

774
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:33,416
So Jin!

775
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:37,010
So Jin, come on.
He's not here.

776
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,679
[What do you mean, I'm not?
I'm right here.]

777
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,603
Let's go up to the third floor.

778
00:51:40,604 --> 00:51:42,842
[What a bunch of newbies...
passing right by Jae Suk.]

779
00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:45,485
[Eric Nam checks the bag...]

780
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:47,853
[But the gold bar is missing!]

781
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:49,899
[Who stole it out of our bag?]
- Who took it?

782
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:53,046
- It wasn't me.
- Come on!

783
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:55,799
- I already gave you one!
- What?

784
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,459
- This is going over the line.
- It wasn't me!

785
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,364
- It really wasn't me.
[Suspects Gary of being the culprit.]

786
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:08,072
- Did someone take their gold?
- I told you that it wasn't me.

787
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:10,427
- Someone wiped them out?
- I'm telling you that it wasn't me.

788
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:13,894
- Who stole our gold?
- This isn't allowed, is it?

789
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:17,083
[Let's forget about the gold for now,
and get back to the name tag elimination.]

790
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:19,939
- He's in the manager's office right now.
- They still haven't found him yet?

791
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,664
What's taking them so long?
They have to find him!

792
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:23,745
He's doing a great job
of dragging out the time.

793
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:27,595
- Where is he?
[Where in the world is he hiding?]

794
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:33,824
[In the meantime, Jae Suk
moves on to the supply room.]

795
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:36,138
[Jae Suk's plan is to drag out the time
by fleeing from his opponents.]

796
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:41,109
- Hey, what are we going to do? Let's go!
- He's dragging out the time.

797
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,627
What if he's upstairs in the library?

798
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,493
[Pink Team heads back to
the supply room on the second floor.]

799
00:52:46,494 --> 00:52:50,282
- Let's check the library.
- It's over here.

800
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:52,816
I'm sure he's moved again
to somewhere else by now.

801
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,736
Search every corner of this room.

802
00:52:59,286 --> 00:53:00,778
There he is!

803
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:02,034
[There he is!]

804
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:06,240
[Get him!]

805
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:09,290
- Okay, I see him.
- Come here and corner him over there.

806
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:12,880
[Where did he go?]

807
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:17,124
[They finally get their hands on him!]

808
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:23,157
We have to rip off his name tag!

809
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,073
[Must rip it off vs Can't rip it off!]

810
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:33,014
[The bloody battle of name tag elimination.]

811
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:36,358
[Jae Suk's counterattack
is definitely at a disadvantage.]

812
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:40,767
[So Jin, out!]

813
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:48,734
- Wow, Jae Suk is so strong!
- I think Jae Suk actually has a chance.

814
00:53:48,735 --> 00:53:52,266
- Wow, I think we might win this.
- What if he ousts the other two?

815
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:55,816
- Why is Gary kneeling down?
- Because I'm frustrated.

816
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,163
Gary was good at dragging out
some time himself.

817
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,171
What are they doing?

818
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:04,147
Please let go!

819
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:08,544
We don't have any gold.

820
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:13,285
You guys have no idea
how desperate we feel right now.

821
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:24,577
[Running Man's hidden Mr. Capable,
Power-Yoo.]

822
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,018
The grip he has on his teeth...

823
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:32,809
He lasted on the grip
and the venom of his teeth.

824
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,595
[How long did it take
the Pink Team to oust Jae Suk?]

825
00:54:42,229 --> 00:54:45,808
Yoo Jae Suk!

826
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:48,231
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- That was no joke.

827
00:54:48,804 --> 00:54:51,480
[Yoo Jae Suk is the best!]

828

[What are these guys doing?]

833
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,111

searching through the second floor.]

Dong Woo, what if he's not
on the second floor?

839
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:38,514
- I wonder if he's on the third floor.
- I think he's on the third floor.

840
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,338
It's okay, it hasn't been that long yet.

841
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:47,839
They remind me of Dumb and Dumber.

842
00:55:48,676 --> 00:55:51,146
I told them not to stick
together like that.

843
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,788
- You guys startled me.
- Is he not up here?

844
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:55,714
[They're unable to find Kwang Soo
up on the third floor.]

845
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:59,973
- I wonder if he's hiding in a locker?
- Where could a big man like that be hiding?

846
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:06,294
[That big man is hiding out
in the reading room.]

847

[The Red Team heads back down
to the second floor.]

[Dong Woon heads into the reading room.]
- Where do you think he went?

850
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,368

[Where is he?]

852

865
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:29,276
When Yoo Jae Suk went in
as the representative of his team

866
00:57:29,276 --> 00:57:32,626
- he went up against the Pink Team?
- Yes.

867
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:37,343
- Your time was 4 minutes and 43 seconds.
- But that won't be the determining factor.

868
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:42,238
Thus, the Pink Team came in at last place
and failed to earn any gold bars.

869
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:47,259
In third place, with the time of
2 minutes and 57 seconds...

870
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,748
- Do you think it's going to be us?
- I wonder who it is?

871
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:54,017
- I really have no idea.
- It's Gary's opponent, Kim Jong Kook's team.

872
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:57,116
- We're in third place?
- Yes, your team came in at third place.

[Second place- 2 minutes and 43 seconds.]

876

[Red Team earns two gold bars,
which brings them to a total of two.]

comes in at first place.]

- Didn't I tell you that I had a good feeling?
- Yes, you did.

886
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:37,174
- But someone took one of our gold bars.
[It wasn't me.]

887
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:41,987
I really don't know who took it,
but why don't you kneel down before us?

888
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:44,257
- And apologize to us that way.
- What's so hard about that, Jong Kook?

889
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:49,614
If that's how it works,
then give it to us.

[Kneeling down is no big deal.
Please give us a gold bar.]

891

Then let's do it this way. Show us
the gold bars you have right now.

892

Then even if you have more later,
we won't count those.

Show us the gold bars you have now,
and tell us how many you have.

- Show us what you have now.
