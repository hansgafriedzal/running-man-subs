There's one person that
would get along with you.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,740
It means today's guests
are around my age.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,060
So the fairies are older
than 30 at least.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't wait to see them!
Please come out!

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,920
Do you want to say
hello to the viewers?

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,660
[She's very funny.]

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,500

[A twirl for her fans.]

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,360
I saw her at our school
reunion not too long ago.

- Ji Won!
- Older Brother!

42
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,080
We're friends.
Why are you calling me that?

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm younger than you, Older Brother.

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,560
We both entered school in 1991.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,420
But I entered
kindergarten earlier.

46
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,820

<i>Today's race is 'The Water Fairy Race'.</i>

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,040
<i>In these bottles, there's special water
that can purify any kind of water.</i>

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,880
<i>Bring this bottle and find the black muddy
water at the world water forum in Daegu.</i>

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200

<i>By the way, you can only use two
public transits to get to Daegu</i>

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,740
<i>among the train, airplane,
inter-city bus, city bus, and a taxi.</i>

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,440
<i>You will have to complete
the missions in the middle</i>

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
<i>and come to 'D' park in
Daegu as soon as possible.</i>

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,780
- You mean a park in Daegu?
- He tells us so casually.

62
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,700
He said 'Come to Daegu quickly.'

63
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,920
You'll pick which public transit
you'll use.

64
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,399
- Pick now?
- Yes.

65
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,900
- I want to take the train.
[They all want to take the train.]

66

[Fairy Ji Hyo's team
picks the red envelope.]

67

[Jae Suk from Fairy Ji Won's team,
comes out to pick.]

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,540
Please give us the yellow one.

69
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,980
Can I take the yellow one?

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,880
I was going to pick the blue one,
but I changed my mind.

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,620
He's annoying.

72
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,660
- We picked the bus.
[The bus tickets and a taxi ticket.]

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,180
- And a taxi.
- The bus and a taxi?

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,260
The bus and... the train!

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,360
[Fairy Ji Won's team,
KTX tickets and bus tickets.]

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
The train is good!
We can eat there.

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,260
- We've got airplane tickets.
- Isn't that the fastest way?

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,200
We have to go all the way to Kimhae
and then back to Daegu?

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,180
Then we can't go straight to Daegu.

80
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,700
[We didn't prepare direct
air tickets to Daegu.]

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,520
They might as well just
go to Jeju Island.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,690
<i>Fairy Seo Hyung's team picked
the airplane and the bus.</i>

83
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,340
<i>When you arrive in Busan, take
the bus and get to Daegu.</i>

84
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,660
Look at Seo Hyung's face.

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,340
I can tell she's thinking
'what are they doing?'

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
As if she doesn't care.

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Aren't you a little cynical?

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,080
She doesn't speak much.

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,240
<i>Fairy Ji Won's team picked
the train and the bus.</i>

90
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,360
<i>You can take the train
for two stations maximum.</i>

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
Pardon?

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,000
<i>If you don't get off at the first station,
you have to get off at the second station.</i>

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,340
You need to get off and
take the bus.

94
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,920
Then we don't know where
we'll be getting off.

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
We picked the best.
We can directly go to Daegu.

96
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,500
I'll ride my bicycle.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,680
What if the first station is Daegu?

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,420
Then we can just get off
at Daegu station.

99
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,360
It might be Busan station, too.

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,640
[Which team will be the first
team to arrive to Daegu?]

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,860
[Use only two types of
transportation to Daegu!]

102
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,980
[Complete the mission!]
[Overcome the adversity!]

103
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,500
[What will be the fortunes
of the three teams?]

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
[Fairy Seo Hyung's team starts.]

105
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,200
<i>We don't know what will happen,
but we cannot lose to this team.</i>

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
[The airplane leaves at 10:30.]

107
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,400
Can we call you sister?
Or fairy?

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
I want to be your friends,
but I'm older.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,060
[Sister fairy and younger guys.]

110
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,883
Since the new year began

111
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't mind younger guys.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,480
But younger guys might
mind older woman.

113
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,400
What do you think about
a guy like Jong Kook?

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,660
He's strong so he can protect you.

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
[Turbo's fan for 20 years.]
- Very nice.

117
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,260
I wish I wasn't older.

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I'm sorry to sit in the middle.

119
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,580
[They seem like they have good
feelings for each other.]

120
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,420
Hold hands behind my back.

121
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,800
You don't have to tell me that.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,080
It's not that hard to
pick Jong Kook up.

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,860
If you confess that you like him,
he'll open his heart.

124
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,860
[Knock at his heart,
and it will be opened.]

125
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,480
Pocket your pride today,
and ask him out three times.

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
You'll be holding hands
by the time we're done.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
She has her own type.

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,420
You shouldn't speak
about type at that age.

129
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,700
You just woke me up!

130
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Ji Hyo always picks the best.

131
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,460
I hope the rest of the
games will be by luck, too.

132
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,500
I want to win by luck once.

133
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,580
- We'll probably get there first.
- I think we don't need to hurry.

134
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,880
- Do you know where KTX stops?
- First stop is probably Gwangmyung.

135
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,840
After Gwangmyung is...

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,770
They'll mostly likely get off in
Cheonan or Daejeon.

137
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:42,700
I think it'll be Cheonan.

138
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,100
You know we can take a taxi
now and still be the first.

139
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,920
Right, the cost might be high though.

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,800
We can taxi and say
'To Daegu, please.'

141
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,040
[Take a taxi and ask to go to Daegu?]

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Pardon?

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,840
Just listen.
Don't question her.

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,520
- Was that a song?
- She hates to be stopped when she sings.

145
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Again, encore.

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,880
Do you actually know
how to play guitar?

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,440
She's feeling it.

148
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Yes, she's good.

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,980
Yoo Jung (Ji Won's real name)
dances, too.

150
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,380
She's very artistic.

151
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,500
She used to wear trench coats
when she was a student.

152
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,220
A lonely and solitary girl.
She was popular, too.

153
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,620
- A mysterious woman?
- Someone with a cold heart.

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,180
[Parole artist, Ye]

155
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,480
Hey, we should have
done this on the train.

156
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,060
- 'Hey' to your Older Brother?
- I'm sorry, Older Brother.

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,500
[KTX to Busan leaves at 10:20.]

158

no problem so far...]

[There's no time to lose!]

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,780
Watch out!

163
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,340
Ten minutes before the train leaves!

164
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,820
[Ten minutes before the train leaves!]

165
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,080
Which platform should we go?

166
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,660
- Where's my magic wand?
- I have it.

167
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,660
[Fairy Ji Won doesn't
forget about her wand.]

168
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
It's right here.

169
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,440
[Run for the train!]

170
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,440

Look, the graduations are
marked on the bottle.

195
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,020
I think we might lose the
water during the missions.

196
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,960
It's better to have more water.

197
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,060
Then it'll be easier to
purify the muddy water.

198

- We'll use it at the end?
- Yes!

199
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,840
We should try not to lose this water.

200

- We got on.
- It's an express bus.

215

It goes to Daegu without
stopping in other cities.

216

339
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,520
Even to the bus terminal?

340
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,220
- I see.
- How can we get to the bus terminal?

341
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,100
You didn't have to put
your hand up like that.

342
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,180
[To the bus terminal!]

343
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,260
[Street performing while
waiting for the bus.]

344
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,740
I write a letter in the fall...

345
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
It's spring.

346
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,480
Is it spring?

347
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,060
Sing something that
matches the weather.

348
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,260
The bus is here!

349
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,040
[The express bus comes right away.]

350
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,540
- Hello!
- Hello!

351
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,400
[They get on the city bus in Daejeon.]

352
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,140
How many stops should we go?

353
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,520
- Where are we?
- We got on here.

354
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,880
The terminal is only two stops away.

355
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
[Two stops]

356
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,960
[They arrive at the bus terminal.]

357
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I see something over there.

358
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
- I see the 'R' flag.
- Yes, it's the 'R' flag.

359
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,960
- Is there a mission for us?
- Let's get off first.

360
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,980
[What is waiting for them?]

361
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,140
- What is it?
- It's a mission.

362
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
- What is it?
- What is it?

363
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,360
It's Coke.

364
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,400
You can take the bus only if
you complete the mission.

365
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,060
- We can't just get on the bus.
- I knew it.

366
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,640
<i>Your mission is to make
the soda cans stand on their own.</i>

367
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,120
<i>You'll succeed when you make ten soda
cans stand for more than 3 seconds...</i>

368
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,840
Isn't that too easy?

369
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>on their side, at a 45 degrees angle.</i>

370
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,140
<i>Use the edges.</i>

371
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,960
They're standing up, why should
we make them stand on their side?

372
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,340
- It's going to fall.
- Is it even possible?

373
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,480
Ten cans?

374
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
- What? How?
- They want this.

375
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,520
- Is that possible?
- There's a man who makes stones stand.

376
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,700
- What should we do?
- Does it make sense?

377
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,220
- It doesn't.
- On it's edge?

378
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
<i>It's not possible!</i>

379
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,860
[What is he doing?]

380
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,860
You're not supposed to do that.

381
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,220
[Don't you know Columbus' egg?]

382
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,760
[It can't be...]

383
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,340
[Wait and see my success...]

384
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,380
[You're not a performance artist...]

385
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,600
He always try useless methods.

386
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,360
- It's cool.
- Let me drink, I'm thirsty.

387
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,300
- Is it?
- Drink from here.

388
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,060
Not one can but ten cans...
How could it be?

389
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,600
You use your brain on Running Man?

390
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,060
This isn't brain work.

391
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,880
Isn't it?

392
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,180
This is not it.
They're not going to stand like this.

393
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,020
Look! We can do this!

394
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,140
[They can rely on each other!]

395
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,460
On it's own.

396
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,780
- On it's own, right?
- Yes.

397
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,400
Strop screaming for nothing.

398
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
I'm trying to focus here.

399
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
[How should I do it?]

400
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,060
[They're not standing up
any time soon, either...]

401
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,020
- It doesn't stand.
- It's not going to work.

402
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,660
They don't want us to go, right?

403
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,520
Do you have gum?

404
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,920
[They wouldn't have any...]

405
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
[They have?]

406
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,520
[He's got a piece of gum.]

407
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,020
We're not allowed to use dirty tricks.
Are we?

408
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm allowed to, right?

409
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,780
<i>You don't need to add anything.
They stand on their own.</i>

410
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,340
Do you know how long I've been trying?

411
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,660
<i>You need to drink some.</i>

412
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,860
Drink some?

413
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,700
How do I do it?
I drank some already.

414
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,900
Drink some and leave some!

415
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,340
It makes sense!

416
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,280
That's right!

417
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,320
Drink some and alter
the center of gravity!

418
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
Pour some here.

419
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,860
We can't drink them all.
Let's ask if they're thirsty.

420
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,480
Would you like some coke?

421
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,740
Don't drink it all.
Leave some in the can.

422
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,200
[Yield for the center of gravity!]

423
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,520
[They hang together with the people.]

424
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
In return...

425
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
we'll succeed!

426
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,180
[He boasts openly.]

427
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
Would it really work?

428
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,160
How much do you have in the can?

429
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,760
It doesn't stand.

430
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,200
[Will this half empty can
stand on its side?]

431
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,160
[It stood up on its side!]

432
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,040
- Jae Suk!
- It worked!

433
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,240
It worked!

434
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,720
- Jae Suk!
- It stood up!

435
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,320
Thank you so much!

436
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,700
The one who told me this...
Where are you?

437
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Thank you so much!

438
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,480
Thank you.

439
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,340
We did it together!

440
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,680
It's the answer!

441
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,900
[Group 'Cola' is
taking a final bow.]

442
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,900
How did you figure it out?

443
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,120
Did you already know this trick?

444
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,960
It's amazing!
How is it possible?

445
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,460
How it is possible?

446
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,100
Incredible!

447
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,360
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine and ten!

448
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,920
[Success! They make
ten cans stand on their side.]

449
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Thank you!

450
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,980
You did it!

451
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,000
Thank you.

move the onion ring.</i>

cracker with your mouth.</i>

459

<i>Using the cracker, move five
onion rings one by one.</i>

460

- Isn't this too thick?
- It's piece of cake!

461

Go, team, go!

462
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,340
This is our first game.

463
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,660
- Don't make it wet!
- It melts in your mouth.

464
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,320
Ready, set, go!

465

[They couldn't stop laughing.
They fail the first try.]

478

You should lower it down like this.

succeed for sure.]

make an egg stand on its end.</i>

508

Even Columbus broke it
to make it stand on its end.

509
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
You know Columbus' egg.

510
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,660
Does it actually stand on its end?

[Make an egg stand on its end!]
[Start!]

516
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,260
Is it even possible?

517
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Does it really stand?

518
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
It does?

519
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
It's not going to happen.

520
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,180
[He's loosing his mind.]

521
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,160
Please give me another egg.
This one's crooked.

[Time marches on.]

523
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,180
It's frustrating.
I think I'm getting upset.

524

[Is it possible?]

525
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,780

broke at the same time.]

- Yes.

533
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,400

534

[The announcement is about
the bus leaving in five minutes.]

[Work of concentration!]

538
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,460
- Hold it.
- Be quiet.

539
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,980
I'm even more pressured now.

540

its own for 3 seconds...]

We're done, right?

545
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,580
- Let's eat this.
- Go to the bathroom now.

This is the stop for
the bus number 512.

558
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,400
Ji Won, why don't you sing a song
while we wait for the bus?

559
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
A song?

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,320
- I think there are many buses.
- They come when you play guitar.

568

- That's true.
- It took us a while.

577

It could have been easy

578

if we could get off the
train in Daegu.

579
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,400

guitar, the bus comes.

- We can't do this.

647

- Why are you guys so weak?
- Ji Hyo's holding herself back right now.

648

tiger will be coming by later.]

- Want to pass on this game?
- Let's just give up now.

- It's five seconds per person.
- Kwang Soo, you'll have two seconds.

665
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:19,205
How would I be able to run around
in only two seconds?

666
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:21,600
Ji Won will have eight seconds,
and you'll have two seconds.

- I have another pair on underneath.
- Then take them off.

I need to reduce the weight
on my body.

671

These are running pants that
professional athletes wear.

Professional athletes wear these.
This is okay, isn't it?

- But those athletes you speak of...

677
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:58,577
they wear another layer on
over those.

678
00:38:58,578 --> 00:39:01,134
- But athletes wear these all the time.
- Seriously?

679
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:04,380
- But they usually wear another layer.
- Athletes wear these all the time.

680
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:06,199
- Aren't those long johns?
- No, they're not.

681
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,880
We might not be able to air this segment.
Is this going to be okay?

682
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,510
What's wrong with these?
These are just a normal pair of pants.

683
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:17,296
But when you start running...

684
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:20,896
Just don't get the camera
too close to me.

685
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,699
What is he doing right now?
Why is he doing that?

686
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,938
I have a short pair of shorts on,
so can I just wear those?

687
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:34,139
- Will my shorts be okay?
- Can he just wear his shorts?

688
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,772
[Kwang Soo has shorts on underneath!]
- We need to check the brand first.

689
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,677
- I'm going to check the brand first.
- Gary, can you go and check his shorts?

690
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,945
- They're really shorts.
- Then let me see.

691
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:46,672
- What are we going to do?
[They're obviously underwear.]

692
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:51,868
- They're definitely underwear.
- Athletes wear those, too.

693
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,778
[Who cares if they're underwear
in the name of victory?]

694
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:57,796
- No, you can't take off your pants.
- This is a variety show.

695
00:39:57,797 --> 00:40:01,074
- They should be considered uniform.
- Let's see what you've got.

696
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:04,030
- We're going to go for it.
- Do you have any diapers?

697
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:07,310
[A little too much even for
his own teammates?]

698
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:12,026
- Wow, they're no joke.
- What is this?

699
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:15,932
- Athletes don't look like that.
- I think he looks cool.

700
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:19,093
- He actually looks like an athlete.
- I think I'm jealous.

701
00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:23,350
Winning is what matters here.
We have to win this mission.

702
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:26,518
Kim Jong Kook will be here soon.
We have to do this before he gets here.

703
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:29,812
Ready, set, go!

704
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,647
[The effect of his pants?
Off at an alarming speed.]

705
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:39,274
[All three must cross the starting line
within 15 seconds to succeed the mission.]

706
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,170
[Already rounding the corner,
and hands off the baton to Kwang Soo.]

707
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:53,059
[Gallops around on his long legs,
and hands off the baton to Ji Won.]

708
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,964
[Ji Won takes off like
a feral beast of the jungle.]

709
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,882
[A clean relay race.]

710
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:06,475
[Would they have completed the race
within 15 seconds?]

711
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,667
[Ji Won crosses the finish line.]

712
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:13,657
[What is their finishing time?]

713
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:18,606
- I think we did it!
- 16.31 seconds.

714
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,734
[Unfortunately misses the deadline,
and loses 100ml of the water.]

715
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:23,655
- We were so close.
- I thought we made it.

716
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:27,253
But he even took off his pants.
Maybe he should've kept them on.

717
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:30,018
- It was because of his pants.
- Maybe he should've kept them on.

718
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:31,544
[Then you should've stopped me...]

719
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,168
[Team Seo Hyung finally arrives.]

720
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:39,397
- What the heck?
- We're the last ones here?

721
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:43,050
- You guys are finally here.
- What took you guys so long?

722
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:44,925
[The three teams are finally altogether.]

723
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:48,624
[Now that all three teams are together,
the mission can finally start for real.]

724
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:52,566
[Team Seo Hyung is feeling the exhaustion
after having taken the bus.]

725
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,854
- Did you guys receive the mission?
- We're doing it right now.

726
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:57,433
- Let us do it, too.
- You need to choose.

727
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,175
[Team Seo Hyung chooses their
mission as soon as they arrive.]

728
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:03,631
- Doesn't this look so pretty?
- It's as if we were meant to choose it.

729
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:07,393
- What is that?
- Fairy pyramid run?

730
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:08,860
Okay, listen carefully.

731
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,341
You're aware of what
the human pyramid is, right?

732
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:15,843
You just need to cross the finish line within
ten seconds while in the pyramid formation.

733
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,910
I thought Seo Hyung said she was going to
seduce Jong Kook by the end of the day.

734
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:22,499
- Really?
- I think he's already halfway there.

735
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,824
It's no big deal.

736
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:29,503
Jong Kook has a nickname,
and it's 'Ahn-Man-Nam.'

737
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:32,675
It means that he'll never
meet you halfway.

738
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,081
- Where do you live?
- In Geumhodong.

739
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:40,086
Okay, it's Seducer Gemhodong,
against Ahn-Man-Nam of Ahnyang.

740
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:44,229
- It's a close call.
- We'll even sing you a serenade.

741
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,461
[A sweet serenade for the two lovebirds.]

742
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,976
Our fairy will sing you a love song
while you do your mission.

743
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:54,393
[The Parisian atmosphere
is already in the air.]

744
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:59,037
Okay, we're going to start the serenade.
With our Ahn-Man-Nam of Ahnyang...

745
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:01,544
Seducer Gemhodong.

746
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:05,894
- This is such a relaxing song.
- It's a really nice song.

747
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:09,425
[All the focus is on the singer even with
all the ruckus going on around them.]

748
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:14,668
[Ji Won's love song lights a fire under
a flame that's already gone out.]

749
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:17,983
[There's the part we've all
been waiting for!]

750
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:21,052
[The lyrics are powerful enough to have
Seo Hyung break out in a dance.]

751
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:24,988
[Falling under the spell of the song's magic.]

752
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:32,036
[Everyone else is focused
on singing the song.]

753
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:36,635
[They all seem very enthused
from the song.]

754
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:39,792
Why do I feel so exhausted
all of a sudden?

755
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:42,185
- Get in position.
- Okay, get ready.

756
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,240
- All bodies must cross the line.
- I'm going to go really fast.

757
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:49,384
Ready... no, wait.

758
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:53,907
- That was a knee-kick.
- That looked dangerous.

759
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:58,211
- What are you doing?
- Get on!

760
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:05,394
[Goes from a human pyramid to a single
ride on Jong Kook in the blink of an eye.]

761
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,062
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What were you doing?

762
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,825
[Seducer Gemhodong's eager attempt
gets her team to fail the mission.]

763
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:19,585
- What am I, chopped liver?
- Just get out of their way.

764
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:22,126
She doesn't lean on me at all.

765
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,332
[Seo Hyung, you can trust me...]

766
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,650
[But Jong Kook is all I need.]

767
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:34,266
- Why are you getting in the way?
- That was crossing the line.

768
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:38,122
You're coming on way too strong!
You're scaring him away.

769
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:41,598
[Too bad... maybe next time.]

770
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:45,214
[Team Seo Hyung makes
another selection.]

771
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:50,106
- The Fairy Bell?
- What is that?

772
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:54,660
[Team Ji Hyo's previously failed
mission is selected.]

773
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,699
- I think Seo Hyung and Jong Kook...
- I think this game is meant for them.

774
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,164
- This game was designed for them.
- Can Jong Kook twirl six times by himself?

775
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:07,511
[Each man must twirl their fairy three times
and ring the bell with her head to succeed.]

776
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:10,943
- Wrap your arms around my neck.
- Did you see how he lifted her up?

777
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:16,496
He sounds like he's getting
his workout.

778
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:19,911
[Mr. Capable successfully twirls her
around in his first attempt.]

779
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:23,323
Let your body go loose,
and drop your arms down.

780
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,763
[Screams out loud in a high-pitched scream.]

781
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:33,098
[Seducer Gemhodong loses all her
resolve in front of Ahn-Man-Nam.]

782
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,830
- The way she just sounded...
- It's like she fell off of Namsan tower.

783
00:45:39,831 --> 00:45:42,451
I thought she was falling off
the 63 Building.

784
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:45,603
[Practice round is over,
and it's time to start the mission.]

785
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:52,505
- Okay, we're going to start.
- Seducer Gemhodong...

786
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:56,002
- Against Ahn-Man-Nam of Ahnyang.
- Hold on, okay?

787
00:45:56,864 --> 00:46:00,884
[And the serenade starts off again.]

788
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:10,054
- Ugh, this is sapping me of my strength.
- Knock it off, you guys.

789
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:16,340
[The finishing lyrics to the song.]
- I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

790
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:20,153
[The serenade has the strange power
of sapping Ha Ha of his energy.]

791
00:46:21,005 --> 00:46:23,045
Ready, set, go!

792
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,985
[Mr. Capable, having figured it out earlier,
easily twirls Seo Hyung around.]

793
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:33,247
Hey!

794
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,793
[Hands off the fairy over to Ha Ha.]

795
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:40,311
Hey, pull my leg out!

796
00:46:45,394 --> 00:46:49,443
[But Kkuk rescues his fairy from
the moment of danger with ease.]

797
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:51,947
[A speedy twirl.]

798
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:56,399
- Wow, they really are pretty fast.
- I think they're picking up speed.

799
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,876
[But Ha Ha still remains an issue.]

800
00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:05,823
[But successfully hands the fairy off
thanks to Kkuk's help.]

801
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:09,155
[Kkuk's third, and final twirl.]

802
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:13,619
[Continuing to pick up the speed.]

803
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,286
[Ha Ha's final twirl.]

804
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:20,937
[A fast enough twirl, and they
might actually have a chance!]

805
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:26,638
[There's the high-pitched scream again.]

806
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:32,087
[Team Seo Hyung fails,
and loses 100ml of their water.]

807
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:34,764
You, come here!

808
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:38,295
I'm so sorry, but I didn't
have any strength left.

809
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:40,958
[Weak Ha Ha's powerful drop.]

810
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:46,743
[A total of 200ml loss for the team.]

811
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,501
[Hope these missions won't make her ill.]

812
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:51,908
- Okay, let's finish this.
- Is it our turn?

813
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:56,723
- Cheek to cheek?
- Yes, cheek to cheek.

814
00:47:56,724 --> 00:48:01,252
All three will have to run a circle around
the mat with a can held between their cheeks

815
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:05,723
and drop the cans into the basket within
ten seconds in order to succeed.

816
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:09,698
[Team Ji Hyo- Cheek to Cheek.]

817
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:14,414
I hope Seo Hyung and
Jong Kook get this mission.

818
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:16,521
Okay, let's go.

819
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,575
[Great teamwork is of the essence
for this mission.]

820
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,461
[What is this!]

821
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:39,714
What is he doing!

822
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:42,142
[Sorry, I was wrong...]

823
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:46,356
[Ji Hyo explodes!]

824
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:47,859
Ji Hyo...

825
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,626
[An attempt to interfere
results in a complete stampede.]

826
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:54,784
- That was crossing the line!
- Then we're going to start interfering, too!

827
00:48:56,523 --> 00:48:58,331
You did good.

828
00:49:00,122 --> 00:49:04,728
All three of you timed it perfectly.
All of you kicked out at the same time.

829
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:07,351
[All three kicked out at the same time.]

830
00:49:07,352 --> 00:49:10,302
- All three kicked out at the same time!
- Three feet at the same time!

831
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,131
- The decision is up to the other teams.
- Are we letting them do it again?

832
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:20,459
- Okay, no more interfering from now on.
[Team Ji Hyo gets a do-over.]

833
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,725
- You can't step on the line.
- Ready...

834
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:26,814
[Must get the cans in the basket within
ten seconds in order to succeed.]

835
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:35,107
[Five years' worth of teamwork is in play!]

836
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:44,135
[Will they be able to succeed
within their time limit?]

837
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:48,167
[The cans are dropped into the basket.]

838
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:51,430
[But did they succeed in getting it
done within ten seconds?]

839
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,910
Team Fairy Ji Hyo's time is...

840
00:49:56,934 --> 00:50:00,805
- 9.9 seconds.
- Yeah!

841
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:04,338
[Team Ji Hyo succeeds the mission.]

842
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:08,676
[Still succeeds the mission
even with the interference.]

843
00:50:11,146 --> 00:50:14,194
Before you go...

844
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:18,945
[A total of two mission failures-
Thus, 200ml is deducted from their bottle.]

845
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,638
You have 800ml, and here's
the final mission location.

846
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:27,715
Win the race by turning the cloudy
water supply into clean water.

847
00:50:27,716 --> 00:50:29,524
You may get started.

848
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:34,362
[First team to get on their way
with the car keys in hand.]

849
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:38,850
- How about we do it like a competition?
- In that case...

850
00:50:38,851 --> 00:50:43,597
We will make you an offer.
Take this mission, and make your own deals.

851
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:47,650
Let's do the flipper run mission
with 200ml on the line.

852
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:51,871
The loser team will lose 200ml of their water

853
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:54,374
and can leave five minutes
after the winning team leaves.

854
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,154
[Rule- Loser team loses 200ml,
and stay behind an extra five minutes.]

855
00:50:56,155 --> 00:50:58,147
Okay, we can do this!

856
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,627
[Only one challenge left to face.]

857
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:04,857
[With the short distance,
the first runners plays a crucial role.]

858
00:51:09,494 --> 00:51:11,645
You have to run faster!

859
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:13,914
[Jae Suk's flipper falls off!]

860
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:17,626
[The prop failure brings the
game to a halt.]

861
00:51:17,627 --> 00:51:20,754
Isn't this all a part of the game?

862
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:22,527
- I think I should tie them.
- That's not fair.

863
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:25,293
Sorry to say this,
but Seo Hyung's really mad.

864
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:29,407
- She's not even saying a word.
- Who cares if your shoe fell off?

865
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:33,326
Let's just get back to the game.

866
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:36,317
She's really angry right now.

867
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,281
[Fairy Seo Hyung's full of anger,
and Fairy Ji Won is full of cheer.]

868
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,430
She can't stay still
not even for a single second.

869
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:46,553
I think I get why you're so well-suited
for the jungle now.

870
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:49,823
- I think I get it now.
- I'll do my best.

871
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:53,741
[On the other hand,
Fairy Seo Hyung is full of nervous energy.]

872
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:56,734
- But you've been wanting to run all day.
- Yes, it's time for you to run.

873
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:59,331
- Let's give her the chance.
- I'll run later.

874
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:03,639
[The fairies will now be the first runners.]

875
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,682
- Ready... set, go!
- There you go!

876
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:10,469
[The two fairies are off
at a powerful start.]

877
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:14,107
[Arrives at the halfway mark
almost at the same time.]

878
00:52:17,603 --> 00:52:20,079
[Makes a slide across the line.]

879
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:23,386
- Time!
[A quick time out.]

880
00:52:24,783 --> 00:52:28,251
[Seo Hyung's slide brings
the game to yet another halt.]

881
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:31,656
[Each team takes their turn
bringing the game to a halt.]

882
00:52:31,657 --> 00:52:35,186
I'm injured right now!

883
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:40,757
- But falling down is the fun of the game.
- Falling down shouldn't count!

884
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:44,089
- What are you guys even saying!
- This shouldn't count.

885
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,947
[This is going to take all night.]

886
00:52:45,948 --> 00:52:50,470
- It's already getting dark!
- But she's saying that she's hurt!

887
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:51,923
You guys saw how hard she fell.

888
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:56,976
But she's not even hurt
because she didn't scream out loud.

889
00:52:57,357 --> 00:53:00,445
[If she had been hurt, then she would've
let out a high-pitched scream.]

890
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:03,164
Let's just stop all this, and
have one final round to end it all.

891
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:06,484
Let's stop playing dirty,
and finish it with one final round.

892
00:53:06,823 --> 00:53:10,853
- Then Jong Kook must show off his moves.
- What are you doing!

893
00:53:12,493 --> 00:53:15,323
[Taekwondo Jong Kook immediately
launches into his moves.]

894
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:19,772
- How about a roundhouse kick?
- What are you doing!

895
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:25,156
- What was that all about?
- Why did you want to see that?

896
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,080
[Jong Kook earns his team another chance
with his show of taekwondo moves.]

897
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,246
- What did seeing any of that do?
- This is the final round.

898
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:36,330
No more giving breaks for falling down,
or having their shoes fall off.

899
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:40,623
I'm not going to do anything,
so whoever crosses the line first...

900
00:53:40,624 --> 00:53:43,897
- Why aren't you doing anything!
- You have to play the mediator!

901
00:53:43,898 --> 00:53:46,814
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not going to do anything.

902
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:49,395
- We've already wasted so much time!
- Kwang Soo...

903
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,981
Let's win this round,
and leave them behind.

904
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,405
[Rule- Loser team will lose 200ml,
and must wait another five minutes.]

905
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,336
Ready, set, go!

906
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:06,900
[The fairies' powerful start.]

907
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,620
[Ji Won is first to pass off her baton.]

908
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:17,019
[Jae Suk takes off at a sprinting pace.]

909
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,275
[Ha Ha is right at Jae Suk's tail.]

910
00:54:22,941 --> 00:54:24,923
[Passes off the baton
almost at the same time.]

911
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,285
[Mr. Capable is now on the move.]

912
00:54:28,384 --> 00:54:32,359
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo!

913
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:35,227
[A high pitched cheer for Kkuk.]

914
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:38,271
[Mr. Capable unleashes his full power.]

915
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:41,913
[Will he successfully take over the win?]

916
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:47,031
[Kwang Soo crosses the finish line
first by the split of a hair.]

917
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:51,343
[Team fairy Ji Won finally
wins the mission.]

918
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:53,596
[The frightening final round
against Mr. Capable.]

919
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:58,001
[Team Fairy Ji Won wins the competition,
and the chance to leave immediately.]

920
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:01,679
Wow, seriously!

921
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:06,863
[Cheery Fairy's celebration of victory.]

922
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,658
- She wants to do this.
- Why are we doing this?

923
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:15,609
That's enough.
Just get going.

924
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,815
- Let's get going.
- Just leave, so I don't have to look at you.

925
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:24,790
You now have a total of 700ml,
but you can get going immediately.

926
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:30,601
Here's the final mission location,
and you will be deducted 400ml.

927
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:33,625
No, not 400ml!
That's too much!

928
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:36,595
[What is the secret behind this water?]

929
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:48,021
[This is the site of the final mission.]

930
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:54,101
[Final mission- Clarify the water.
But first, they must find the location.]

931
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:59,634
[Team Ji Hyo is first to arrive
at the final mission site.]

932
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:02,374
- It feels like a race of some sorts.
- I think you're right.

933
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,971
- I think we need to find the site first.
- Should we separate or what?

934
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:07,937
- I'll go up to the second floor.
- Okay, I'll go check over this way.

935
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:11,828
Where's the mission?

936
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:15,167
[Where's the mission site?]
- Oh, there's the top.

937
00:56:15,168 --> 00:56:17,382
I have a feeling about this place.

938
00:56:17,383 --> 00:56:20,126
[Gary is already at
the top floor of the building.]

939
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:29,533
[This is the contaminated water
that they must clarify.]

940
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,117
[Team Fairy Ji Hyo is first
to discover the mission site.]

941
00:56:33,118 --> 00:56:37,573
You need at least 1L of the fairy water in
order to clarify the contaminated supply.

942
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:41,541
Stealing the other teams water
is also allowed to accomplish the task.

943
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:43,509
[Must clarify the contaminated water
by obtaining 1L of the fairy water.]

944
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,981
[Team Fairy Ji Hyo currently has
800ml of the fairy water.]

945
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:50,234
- It's on the third floor, and we were right.
- What is it?

946
00:56:50,235 --> 00:56:53,286
- We have to steal, don't we?
- We need a total of 1L to win the race.

947
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:55,598
- Is that the mission?
- Then we have to dump it all in the supply.

948
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,435
[Team Fairy Ji Hyo has the advantage
for knowing the rules of the game.]

949
00:56:58,436 --> 00:57:01,033
Getting here first gave us
a huge upper hand.

950
00:57:01,403 --> 00:57:05,183
[Team Fairy Ji Won is the second team
to arrive on scene.]

951
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:12,117
If we do this right,
then we can win this right away.

952
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:17,999
[We'll end this game before
the other team even finds the final mission.]

953
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:22,811
Gary, I'll go up to the third floor
with our water bottle.

954
00:57:24,113 --> 00:57:27,635
[The plan is for Gary and Big-nose to ambush
their opponents and steal their water.]

955
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:31,028
[Then pass it off to Blank Ji,
who'll be waiting on the third floor.]

956
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,763
- Do we have to find the mission card?
- I don't know.

957
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:36,843
[Team Fairy Ji Won is still unsure
of what the final mission is.]

958
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:41,467
[Here comes the prey!]

959
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:44,487
- Be careful of our water.
- I don't know what to expect.

960
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:47,303
[Not knowing what to expect
puts them on edge.]

961
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:51,607
- Ji Won, are you feeling nervous?
- There's Ji Hyo!

962
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:54,935
- There's Ji Hyo!
- Where? Song Ji Hyo!

963
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:58,345
- Have you found anything?
- No, I haven't found anything yet.

964
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:01,125
[Something smells fishy!]

965
00:58:02,673 --> 00:58:07,004
[Gary's plan is to make a casual
approach, and eye for his chance.]

966
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:09,456
We have to find it first.

967
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:17,942
- I think they know something.
- I'm getting a weird feeling about this.

968
00:58:17,943 --> 00:58:19,656
They keep following us.

969
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:22,751
- Why are you following us?
- We were headed there, too.

970
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:25,932
You guys are running away from us,
so it's just making me run faster.

971
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:31,208
[Big-nose makes a sloppy approach.]

972
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,925
[This is what you call an ambush?]

973
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:39,230
- You're after our water, aren't you?
- We just want to see how much you have.

974
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,004
- They're trying to steal our water.
- There must be some sort of a mission.

975
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:44,324
[Team Ji Hyo's plan comes to an end,
only after giving their opponents a hint.]

976
00:58:47,518 --> 00:58:52,500
[Team Fairy Seo Hyung is the last to arrive.]

977
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:55,180
I'm already getting weird vibes.

978
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,216
What is it?

979
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,663
[Team Fairy Ji Won discovers the mission.]

980
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,728
[Enter the safe zone with at least
1L of water in order to win the race.]

981
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:08,067
We have to steal their water?

982
00:59:08,068 --> 00:59:10,642
[All three teams needs the fairy water
from their opposing teams in order to win!]

983
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,582
[Which of the three teams will successfully
clarify the contaminated water supply?]

984
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:19,332
[Team Fairy Seo Hyung also
gets on the move.]

985
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,825
I think they're headed down here.

986
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:23,960
[Team Ji Won- Up above.
Team Seo Hyung- Down below.]

987
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:28,102
- I don't see Jong Kook down there.
- Where did he go?

988
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:32,166
[Jong Kook is nowhere to be seen...]

989
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:36,042
- That's a definite trap.
- Should I go down there by myself?

990
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,852
- Should I go down there by myself?
- Go down there.

991
00:59:38,853 --> 00:59:42,009
[Ji Won takes the water bottle,
and Kwang Soo gets on the move.]

992
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:47,454
[The Giraffe is right
in front of their eyes!]

993
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:55,606
[Have they been cornered?]

994
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,507
Jong Kook, I don't have anything!

995
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:07,649
[Giraffe... an ambush attack
is the Tiger's specialty...]

996
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:13,270
- What are you after?
- Don't come here!

997
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:15,387
<i>Don't come here!</i>

998
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:21,303
- See? I told you that it was a trap.
- It was, wasn't it?

999
01:00:21,304 --> 01:00:23,720
[Sacrificing the Giraffe was something
we've been prepared to do.]

1000
01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:29,989
[His foolish attempts at an attack
result in his own agony.]

1001
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:34,087
Jong Kook, let's go and get
Suk Jin together.

1002
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:41,059
[What was the herbivore thinking
by attacking the carnivore?]

1003
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:45,298
- Come here, and chastise him.
- I'm so sorry.

1004
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:47,900
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Doesn't this mean that Kwang Soo is dead?

1005
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:51,622
[This is just a variety show, Seo Hyung.]

1006
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:56,082
Let's go and steal the water from them.

1007
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:59,649
- What if we stay in hiding?
- But we're dead if we're caught.

1008
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,633
- Let's go and hide amongst the staff.
- Amongst the staff?

1009
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:06,220
I know it's not a solid plan,
but it's also the safest.

1010
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:09,165
If you hide behind all those people,
then they might not see you at all.

1011
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:12,844
No one will see you back there, and
we'll go steal the water from someone.

1012
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:17,409
- Seriously?
- Yeah, and we'll be back within ten minutes.

1013
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:20,393
- We'll check in every five minutes.
- Okay.

1014
01:01:20,394 --> 01:01:23,034
- Come and check in.
- We'll come back and check in with you.

1015
01:01:23,035 --> 01:01:26,310
- No, don't go anywhere! Stay right there.
- Stay safe.

1016
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,773
Just stay right there.

1017
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:32,468
Let me just stay here
right between you guys.

1018
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:36,601
[This is where Blank Ji is hiding.]

1019
01:01:36,602 --> 01:01:39,180
- That's the final mission site.
- We have to come up with a plan.

1020
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:41,075
[Just then, the arrival of their
opponents!]

1021
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:45,625
No matter what happens,
you just stay right here and wait.

1022
01:01:45,626 --> 01:01:47,345
[Oh no, it's Jong Kook!]

1023
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:50,414
- It's cold out here.
- It is, isn't it?

1024
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,696
- Just keep walking around.
- Okay, I'll walk around.

1025
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:58,592
[Hmm... where should I hide?]

1026
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:01,900
[No, don't come here!]

1027
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:07,971
[Kkuk also takes his spot
amongst the staff members.]

1028
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:12,350
[What a novel site.]

1029
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:16,594
[Meanwhile, Haroro and Seo Kyung
are off on a search for more water.]

1030
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:18,956
[Huh?]

1031
01:02:18,957 --> 01:02:22,141
Jae Suk, come here!

1032
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:24,716
[Giraffe gets to him first!]
- Stay right there.

1033
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:27,969
- Help me get his shoes off.
[What do I do?]

1034
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:31,138
- Let me see your shoes.
[The opposite of the earlier scene.]

1035
01:02:31,173 --> 01:02:35,917
Here, Jong Kook!
Ji Won is alone, and now's the chance!

1036
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,862
- Now's the chance!
- Don't make me thrown this down.

1037
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:41,245
Ji Won is alone!
Right now is the chance!

1038
01:02:41,246 --> 01:02:44,290
[Just then... Gary makes his move!]

1039
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:49,504
[She really threw it down!]

1040
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,796
[The woman from another star...
She throws away the precious water bottle!]

1041
01:02:55,797 --> 01:02:58,096
Get down!
Get down!

1042
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,962
[The first person to get to the bottle
gets the chance to win!]

1043
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:05,913
[Big-nose took the elevator?]

1044
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:10,529
[The water bottle is mine!]

1045
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:16,252
[Gary gets to it first!]

1046
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:22,710
[Gary... Suk Jin is still in the elevator.]

1047
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:26,318
Suk Jin!

1048
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,731
[Gary tosses the bottle away.]

1049
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,985
[Big-nose is nowhere to be found,
and the water is returned to its owner.]

1050
01:03:33,986 --> 01:03:36,908
[We must steal that bottle away!]

1051
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,048
Where did Suk Jin go!

1052
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:44,092
[I'm coming... huh?]

1053
01:03:44,455 --> 01:03:48,845
[Must steal the water away,
and get it to our Tiger.]

1054
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:52,103
- Where did Seo Hyung go?
- Where are you?

1055
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:54,151
Where are you!

1056
01:03:54,152 --> 01:03:58,296
[Seo Hyung makes her attack.]

1057
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:03,454
[But the fairy water is passed off
to Yoo Hyuk's hands.]

1058
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:10,828
[After all the tussle, and fighting,
the fairy water makes its way to the top.]

1059
01:04:12,258 --> 01:04:14,439
Jong Kook!

1060
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:17,119
[It's not time yet...]

1061
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:23,703
[They didn't know it at the time...
but all three bottles were in one place.]

1062
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:33,657
Kwang Soo, you know what to do, right?
Just dump it if anyone tries to get it.

1063
01:04:33,989 --> 01:04:37,202
- We'll let the other two teams battle it out.
- Really?

1064
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,639
- It's no loss for us.
- We'd rather just dump it out.

1065
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,068
- Do you think you're brave enough to do it?
- Why don't you try it?

1066
01:04:44,766 --> 01:04:47,934
Dump out everything you've got.

1067
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:53,077
Don't do that!

1068
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,742
[My chance will come...]

1069
01:04:57,743 --> 01:05:00,930
It's only going to get colder for him.

1070
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:04,137
- Kwang Soo...
- I'm not cold yet.

1071
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:08,308
Ha Ha... where's Ji Hyo? I think
she's hiding around here somewhere.

1072
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,424
- What do I do?
- We have to find Ji Hyo.

1073
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:17,607
- I'll go around.
[The net is closing in.]

1074
01:05:18,037 --> 01:05:20,288
[Big-nose also takes off his socks.]

1075
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:25,061
[Team Ji Won is in danger!]

1076
01:05:27,384 --> 01:05:31,393
[Barefooted Giraffe attempts
to make his escape!]

1077
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:35,425
[Just what is going on here?]

1078
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:41,016
[Will they steal...
or have it stolen away?]

1079
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:44,756
[The battle where the victory
hangs on the line!]

1080
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:46,690
[Should I go out there and help them?]

1081
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:49,329
[Huh?]

1082
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:52,852
[What is this weird feeling?]
- Where's Jong Kook?

1083
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:05,002
[Makes eye contact with the Tiger.]

1084
01:06:07,344 --> 01:06:09,702
[Blank Ji flees for safety.]

1085
01:06:12,825 --> 01:06:16,248
[Ji Hyo must be captured!]

1086
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:20,539
[It's time for me to start
making my move.]

1087
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:24,568
[Ji Hyo becomes the main target.]

1088
01:06:27,044 --> 01:06:30,244
[A battle to clarify
the contaminated water supply.]

1089
01:06:30,245 --> 01:06:36,847
[Any one of the teams has the chance to win
by stealing their opponent's water.]

1090
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:44,437
[Ha Ha successfully steals it away!]

1091
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:49,933
[This is the moment that he's waited for...
Kkuk is on the move!]

1092
01:06:49,934 --> 01:06:51,869
[What the heck?]

1093
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,937
[What is Jong Kook doing there?]

1094
01:06:55,165 --> 01:06:59,542
[Ha Ha plays defense...
and Jong Kook breaks past Jae Suk!]

1095
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:02,742
[No!]

1096
01:07:02,743 --> 01:07:07,571
[Kkuk enters the safe zone.]

1097
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:13,138
[The winners are determined
in the blink of an eye.]

1098
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:17,061
- Jong Kook and I were both hiding there.
- But neither of you knew?

1099
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:21,859
[The evidence of a fierce battle.]

1100
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:27,239
Dump the contents of both the bottles,
and the men will have to stir it up.

1101
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:33,323
[Seo Hyung's 600ml, and Ji Hyo's 800ml-
A total of 1400ml of fairy water.]

[The contaminated water supply
is starting to change!]

1103
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,669
The water is starting to dilute.

1104
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:51,509
[The once muddy looking water...
is all of a sudden clear as crystal!]

1105
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:57,171
[As the water clears up, a written
word can be seen at the bottom!]

1106
01:07:58,966 --> 01:08:05,717
[Team Fairy Seo Hyung wins the race!]

1107
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:09,699
[Winning prize- Gold rings.]

1108
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,507
[Breaks out in a bright smile
after having seen her prize.]

1109
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:15,445
You two should get married!

1110
01:08:15,446 --> 01:08:18,261
[The two should get married!]

1111
01:08:19,774 --> 01:08:22,203

- Thank you for coming on our show.
