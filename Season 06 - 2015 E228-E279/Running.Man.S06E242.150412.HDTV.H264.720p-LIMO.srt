171
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,270
<i>You will go forward the number
of steps the wolf says.</i>

172
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,100
<i>You will win when you rip off
the wolf's name tag.</i>

173
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,070
<i>When the the lambs are close,
the wolf says 'meal time!'...</i>

174
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,070
<i>turns around and runs.</i>

175
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,270
<i>The wolf has to oust the lambs
before they get out of the water.</i>

176
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,500
After the wolf says 'meal time,'
he will run toward us.

177
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,050
- Can we rip off the wolf's name tag?
- Not at that time.

178
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,000
You think you can rip off Jong Kook's
name tag when he's running toward you?

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,800
- Refrigerated patient!
- Refrigerated patient!

180
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm hungry today.

181
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,800
You look very relaxed, Kwang Soo.

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,170
This game is not a problem for us.

183
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,770
<i>Please choose who will be the wolf.</i>

184
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>You should know that the
person who plays this game</i>

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>won't be able to play
the next game.</i>

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,820
Is there another game that
needs physical strength?

187
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,700
<i>We've already given you the information,
but Yoo Jae Suk lost it...</i>

188
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,400
- Damn!
- It's his fault!

189
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,970
Why didn't you bring it for me?

190
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,070
What did you say?

191
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,550
You should have brought it yourself.
You're the leader.

192
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,000
Actually, we don't know
what the other games are.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,870
Come out, Kim Jong Kook!
Bring it on!

194
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,870
- Are you scared?
- Why don't you do it?

195
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,620
- What are you going to do?
- I don't mind doing it.

196
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Kim Jong Kook is scared.

197
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,820
[Scared...]

198
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,700
[The team of seven starts provoking him.]
- Don't listen to them.

199
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,470
<i>Kim Jong Kook is scared.</i>

200
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,320
[Big-nose sings an impromptu
song to provoke him.]

201
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,720
I'll play the wolf.
I'll do it.

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,670
It's important to have good roots.
We need to win this game.

203
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,350
I'm not afraid to get wet!

204
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,250
Be quiet!

205
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll be the wolf.

206
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
<i>Kim Jong Kook will be the wolf.</i>

207
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,070
<i>- Please wear the lamb head bands.
- I see.</i>

208
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,270
- I made another title for this game.
- What is it?

209
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,770
It's 'The Silence of The Lambs.'

210
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,300
'The Silence of The Lambs,' you know.

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,170
You never know what will happen.

212
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,320
Jong Kook is already calculating
how many steps we're away.

213
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,100
He's meticulous.

214
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,570
[He's a spine-chilling wolf.]
- He looks like a wolf.

215
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,870
Go, Jong Kook, go!

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,670
[Come on, my prey!]

217
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,000
- He looks like a real wolf.
- I'm scared!

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,400
[The wolf's team members are happy.]

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,350
[In Kkuk's head,
the lambs are all dead.]

220
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,700
- I hate him.
- Me, too.

221
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,870
I hate myself more for being
scared of him.

222
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,020
Don't we need to make a plan?

223
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,250
Regardless of a plan, we'll
have to sacrifice some of us.

224
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,770
Look, all of us won't
be able to survive.

225
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,420
But the team has to win.

226
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,250
Do we have to walk forward?

227
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,220
Don't even think of running away
or kicking your team members.

228
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,550
Kicking the team members?

229
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,820
Let's finish this in one round!

230
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,720
We'll start the game that
Nila Andina sent us.

231
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,550
We'll win, Nila!

232
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,170
Don't worry, Nila!

233
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,300
We'll finish it in one round!

234
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

235
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,220
What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

236
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,570
[The wolf can say any time between
one o'clock and eight o'clock.]

237
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,570
Eight o'clock!

238
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,220
- Eight o'clock.
[The lambs have to move eight steps.]

239
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,170
Five, six, seven...

240
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,400
[The lambs have to move discreetly.]

241
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,070
[The wolf has to figure out
where the lambs are.]

242
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,200
They came further than I thought.

243
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,500
What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,770
- Five o'clock.
- Pardon?

245
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,900
- Five o'clock.
- Say it louder.

246
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,750
Five o'clock.

247
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,370
[The lambs move five steps.]

248
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,750
- Some of you shortened your strides.
- Be careful.

249
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,820
It'll be his meal time soon.

250
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,120
Be careful.

251
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,120
What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,250
Two o'clock.

253
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,620
- Why?
- Why is it two o'clock?

254
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,700
[I can hear you.]

255
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
They're not very close yet.

256
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
Be careful, he's going to eat soon.

257
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,050
Aren't you little too far, Gary?

258
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,700
[I'm scared.]

259
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,970
[Let me see...
they're pretty close.]

260
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,770
What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

261
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,100
Meal time!

262
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,000
[Eliminate the lambs' name tags
before they get out of the water.]

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,650
[Run for your life!]

264
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,220
[Meal time!]

265
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,420
[Wolf Kkuk's maximum power.]

266
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,370
[Incredible speed.]

267
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,470
[He closes the gap in a flash...]

268
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,550
[I got you!]

269
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,700
[He eliminates Big-nose's name tag.]

270
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,850
[Big-nose is ousted.]

271
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,940
[Shocked]
- He did it!

272
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,650
[Horrifying]

273
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,570
Am I ousted?

274
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,470
When did it happen?

275
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,470
[His hunt was successful!]

276
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,350
[With incredible speed...]

277
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,250
[he hunted the lamb right before
he got out of the water.]

278
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,070
[This is how wolf Kkuk hunts.]

279
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,170
[They are in a state of panic.]

280
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,220
They were in the middle last time.

281
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,220
- You can eliminate two name tags.
- Let them go further.

282
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,300
We can't play like this.
Let's work together.

283
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,620
[Wolf Kkuk is ready
for the next round.]

284
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,880
Let's say it's three o'clock.

285
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,450
I can walk three steps and
eliminate the wolf's name tag?

286
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,420
- He can't eliminate me, can he?
- No, I can't.

287
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,670
- Is that so?
[Gary understands the rules now.]

288
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,750
- You were at the back!
- I didn't know that.

289
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,170
[I was wondering why
everybody was in a hurry.]

290
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,120
Let me tell you one thing.

291
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,070
Yong Hwa and Hong Ki,
you've shortened your strides.

292
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,970
We're a team.
You shouldn't do that!

293
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,370
- We'll work together.
- Help us!

294
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,270
- Let's eliminate the wolf together!
- Let's go!

295
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,670
- Let's do it.
- We can do it!

296
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,400
Let's do it this time!

297
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,850
I'll do it this time!

298
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,700
[Which lamb should I get?]
- Ready, set, go!

299
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,250
What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

300
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,500
- Eight o'clock!
- Okay!

301
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,170
[Their aggressive steps.]

302
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,000
[They've already reached
the mid-point.]

303
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,070
Go, team, go!

304
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,670
Wait, wait!

305
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,670
Oh my!

306
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,950
I think two o'clock is a good time.

307
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,600
<i>Please don't let the wolf know.</i>

308
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,170
<i>It's eight o'clock, but
they're already...</i>

309
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,600
[In a suppressed tone...]
- What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

310
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,770
One o'clock!

311
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,370
- One o'clock?
- Don't move.

312
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,470
Just pretend we're moving.

313
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,720
[I can hear you, Ji Hyo.]

314
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,520
[What good is it to whisper now?]

315
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,700
- Don't go!
[Jae Suk and Yong Hwa take a big step.]

316
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,220
- Don't go!
- What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

317
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,550
[What time is it, Mr. Wolf?]

318
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,000
One o'clock!

319
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,870
- One o'clock!
- Don't go!

320
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,170
The water makes noise!

321
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,220
They put us in the water!

322
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,700
And they tell us to walk quietly.

323
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,750
[I hear the water.]

324
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,670
People at the back should ask the wolf.

325
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,570
- Jae Suk!
[Only two of us will ask the wolf.]

326
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,070
Oh, I see. Yong Hwa will
stay at the back and ask...

327
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,120
Are you going to let this happen?

328
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,750
We can't help it.
Because we can hear it.

329
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,300
I said one o'clock a while ago.
Didn't you move yet?

330
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,100
[He made a lot of progress....]

331
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,600
[It's too close...]

332
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,150
[Am I too close?]

333
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,570
[Tactless Gary joins Jae Suk.]

334
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,400
[Jae Suk and Gary attack the wolf.]

335
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,070
[If I can eliminate that name tag...]

336
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,720
[we, lambs can live in peace.]

337
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,750
[He just needs to rip it off.]

338
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,020
[Were you there?]

339
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,020
I can do it!
I can do it!

340

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,770
3 or 4 meters down?

514
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,370
I wonder if this person
watched Running Man...

515
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,370
It's not a mixed martial arts.

516
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,870
On the ground?

517
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,320
We're not going to play this.

518
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,070
It's what they've suggested.

519
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,600
We're not going to play it.

520
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,070
[They're at about 3 meters
above the ground floor.]

521
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,300
You're not going to fall from here.

522
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,370
Mae Katrina from the
Philippines suggested this.

523
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,910
Climb up a slippery bamboo tree

524
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,150
and catch the flag that is 10 meters
high with your bare hands.

525
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,050
They're joking, aren't they?

526
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,950
- Calm down!
[They're games made for Spider-Man.]

527
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,800
We're not superheros.

528
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,950
Katrina, you have a incredible idea.

529
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,800
But please don't think
we have super powers.

530
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Did you really think
I went against time?

531
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,620
- I think it might be fun.
[Are you sane?]

532
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,700
All kinds of games
from all over the world.

533
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,800
We really appreciate
that you love us so much.

534
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,970
One member from the team of three...

535
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,470
It's either Il Woo or the pond skater.

536
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,900
[The pond skater
with long arms and legs.]

537
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,350
Their ace unexpectedly lost the game.

538
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,900
- It hit them hard.
- I didn't think we'd lose.

539
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,570
Il Woo will play this time.

540
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,670
[Il Woo's been doing Pilates.]

541
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,120
<i>There are seven games here.</i>

542
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,850
<i>Please pick one.</i>

543
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,670
Pick a good one.

544
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,550
- What is it?
- Are you usually lucky?

545
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,320
[What will be the first game
for their second mission?]

546
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,200
What is this?

547
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,620
- Bottle fishing?
- I know what it is.

548
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,720
<i>This game is suggested by</i>

549
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,260
<i>Try Desyant Oppieta
from Indonesia and other...</i>

550
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,700
I love Try Desyant Oppieta.

551
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
<i>people from Asian countries.</i>

552
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,700
<i>Place a rope with a pencil
around your waist.</i>

553
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>The pencil stays
at the back like a tail.</i>

554
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,870
<i>Place an empty bottle on the floor
and try putting the pencil in.</i>

555
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,770
<i>You win when you
lift the bottle first.</i>

556
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,020
Who's going to play this?

557
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,870
Do you want to go first, Hong Ki?

558
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,870
- You'll go first?
- It's difficult.

559
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,870
You have to make it lower.

560
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,700
<i>For the team of three to win</i>

561
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,170
<i>you'll have to beat four people
from the team of seven.</i>

562
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:23,950
<i>The bottle has to be
lifted for three seconds.</i>

563
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,350
- It is possible, right?
- Of course.

564
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,700
- Show it off, Hong Ki.
- Yes.

565
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,100
Show it to Try Desyant Oppieta.

566
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Let's win.

567
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,900
I know Il Woo is not
good at games like this.

568
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,600
- Don't listen to him.
- I'll show him.

569
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,900
Show it off.

570
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,850
[Hong Ki vs. Il Woo]

571
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,850
Do it slowly.

572
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,350
[Hallyu idol, Hong Ki vs.
Hallyu actor Il Woo.]

573
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,570
- Hong Ki!
- Move forward.

574
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,800
That's good.

575
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,750
[That was close.]

576
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,750
You said you have problems
with your bidet, Hong Ki.

577
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,500
- Lift it now!
- He almost did it.

578
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,770
[Almost in?]

579
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,100
[Will Il Woo possibly...]

580
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,270
[win this game now?]

581
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,000
- Just a little bit.
- Lower, lower.

582
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,870
[It landed on the neck.]

583
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,370
You did it, Il Woo!

584
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,370
Lift it now!

585
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,420
[He lifted it.]

586
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,370
[He lost it.]

587
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,020
[A brief moment of
cockiness ruined it.]

588
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,300
Move forward, Hong Ki.

589
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,820
[It's thrilling for the watchers.]

590
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,750
It drives me crazy!

591
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,920
Now!
Now!

592
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,670
[He did it again.]

593
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,970
Who thought of a game like this?

594
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,170
One, two, three!

595
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,120
[Il Woo succeeds at bottle fishing.]

596
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,220
I'm sorry.

597
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,850
[Depressed Hong]

598
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,570
I'm sorry.

599
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,800
How did you do it, Il Woo?

600
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,420
<i>The next runner.</i>

601
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,150
- Let me do it.
- Okay.

602
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,950
[Jae Suk vs. Il Woo]

603
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,950
[5 years of Running Man experience vs.
A Pilates Boy's flexibility.]

604
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,950
<i>It's one to zero.</i>

605
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,650
<i>Ready, set...</i>

606
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,970
I think you can do it.

607
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,320
Put it in!

608
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,650
He's good at it.

609
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,000
- Did he put it in?
- Not yet.

610
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,350
- Lower.
- Don't shake it.

611
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,550
Now!

612
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,270
- It's in!
[He lifted...]

613
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,750
[He loses it again.]

614
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,770
[Jae Suk's fishing line goes in.]

615
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,820
[Power lifting]
- One, two...

616
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,500
One, two, three!

617
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,900
[Jae Suk succeeds
at bottle fishing.]

618
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,670
[Jae Suk celebrates it
with his hip dance.]

619
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,250
[Fired up!]
- That's nice!

620
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,250
Look at this!

621
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,250
This is how you play it.

622
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,100
Il Woo, you're in trouble.

623
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,350
Just like this.

624
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,800
It's okay, Il Woo.

625
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,500
This is good!

626
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,850
- Go away!
- What did you say?

627
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,570
What did you say?

628
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,570
Cheer up, friend!

629
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,800
We're on the upturn!

630
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,350
Let's decide who'll go next.

631
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,320
Why is he playing now?

632
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,820
[Just trust me.]

633
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,620
I think I can do it quickly.

634
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,950
Suk Jin is pretty good at it.

635
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,300
<i>- Ready!
- Let's go!</i>

636
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,500
<i>Set, go!</i>

637
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,100
Don't worry about him.

638
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,150
Suk Jin's pencil seems like it's weak.

639
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,850
- It reached.
- My aim is good.

640
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,320
- It went in.
- Now!

641
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,120
Go little further.
You did it!

642
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,450
One, two, three!
Okay!

643
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,900
[Il Woo does it easily.]

644
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,750
What is he doing?

645
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,800
You broke the upturn.

646
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,550
No, he was very fast this time.

647
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,370
- He was fast.
- Bring it on.

648
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,900
[Holding his head high.]

649
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,820
Bring it on!

650
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,150
He's smiling again.

651
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,500
He is 'il-hee il-bee.'
(Now glad, now sad)

652
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,020
[Introducing Jung Il Hee.]
(Now glad)

653
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,070
[Introducing Jung Il Bee.]
(Now sad)

654
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,250
Show him, Yong Hwa.

655
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,820
I was born for Running Man.

656
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,850
How many times was Yong Hwa
on here, 16 times?

657
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,200
It's his 12th time.

658
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
It's my 12th mission.

659
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,900
Is he a regular member?

660
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,100
He has won more than Suk Jin.

661
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,300
[An inconvenient truth for Suk Jin.]

662
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,420
Look at Hong Ki.

663
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,370
He looks sad that he lost.

664
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,050
[Depressed Hong.]

665
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,150
He didn't play an active role today.

666
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,800
- He feels bitter.
[I wanted to do it well.]

667
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,800
<i>Ready!</i>

668
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,050
<i>Set!</i>

[Two adventurers have
met at the bottle fishing!]

670
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,520
<i>Set, go!</i>

671
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,900
Il Woo is very good.

672
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,720
- He's getting used to it.
- Lower, lower!

673
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,900
[Il Woo puts it in.]

674
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,720
[Yong Hwa puts it in, too.]

675
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,900
[It's neck and neck!]

676
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:59,400
[Who will win this round?]

677
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,470
[Il Woo lifts up first.]

678
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,950
[Jung Il Woo wins by a hair.]

679
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,120
One, two, three!
Okay!

680
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,070
[We're proud of you,
Jung Il Woo!]

681
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,100
It was really close.

682
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,350
I missed it by a second!

683
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,900
- He did it really well, though.
- You did well.

684
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,650
Bring it on!

685
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,970
Because of Suk Jin,
the upturn is ruined.

686
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,000
Bring it on!

687
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,700
We need to take it back.

688
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,950
The pencil reaches to the neck
when you bend your knees.

689
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,220
[Blessed by his height.]
- Wow, it's close.

690

Wait, that's too low.

691
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,450
Your belt is too low.

692
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,250
- Your pelvis can't be that low.
- This is my pelvis.

693
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,200
I take after my mom's family.

694
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,550
The belt is touching his bottom.

695
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,550
Wear it on your pelvis.

696
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,350
He says it's his pelvis.
Why are you saying it's not?

697
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,620
It's my mom's family.

698
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:13,370
<i>Il Woo, you will win the first game
if you win this round.</i>

699
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,370
- Will it really happen?
- This is the last round, Il Woo.

700
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,500
He's Il-hee Il-bee guy.

701
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,520
Don't worry.

702
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,650
Don't be too serious.

703
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,920
[The ridiculous competitive
spirit of his.]

704
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,050
I'm very competitive.

705
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,900
He's well balanced
because of the Pilates.

706
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,150
- That's the effect of Pilates.
- We should have practiced it, too.

707
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,720
Ha Ha's pencil is already
touching the bottle.

708
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,420
Great!

709
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,220

[He dances out of joy.]

720

Suk Jin played the game
without discussing with us.

721
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,470
He totally broke the upturn.

722
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:32,400
As a leader of the team, I order you
to take a break for the next game.

723
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
It doesn't even make sense!

724
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,200
You'll need me.

725
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,250
You can't do that.
He has to play for us.

726
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,600
This is my team's matter.

727
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,720
- He needs to play.
- Mind your own business!

728

He must play!

730

- Please pick another one.</i>

731
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,200
- I'm upset.
- Let's beat Il Woo.

732
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
Let's say 'woo.'

734
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,600
I have a good feeling.

735
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,800
Yellow is nice.
Your face will turn yellow soon.

736
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
This time, it's from the United States.

737
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,850
- The zombie game.
- Zombie?

738

seven people's arms and oust them</i>

741

<i>within two minutes.</i>

742

<i>You will have to stay on
the blue mat.</i>

743

Is it okay if he bites off some flesh?

744
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,550
Of course, he's the zombie.

745
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,300

and it will leave a mark.</i>

[Il Woo the zombie
with Red lips appears.]

747
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,100
I'll throw away the
one who's bitten.

748
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Please count the blood as lipstick
when someone's bitten.

749
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Are the stork and the muscle man here
doing something for this game?

750
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,820
The stork and the muscle man?

751
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,670

00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,970
He stepped outside of the mat!

759

[The producers were originally concerned
that this game might be over in 30 seconds...]

has passed?

neighborhood boy than a zombie]

00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,940
[Blocking Hong Ki's future while
blocking his attack...]

861
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,950
Hong Ki is very enthusiastic when he
begins, but after his games...

862
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,760
He tries hard!

863
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,670
[His beginnings are always grand...]

864
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,070
[But his ends are always inglorious.]

865
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,720
I'm sorry!

866
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,970
[At least in this game...]

867
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,560
[I wanted to do well...]

868
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,740
[Today's very long for Depressed Hong!]

869
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,890
Next!

870
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,750
- Yong Hwa!
- Let's go, Yong Hwa!

871
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,380
[Payback time!]

872
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,440
[Come on!]

873
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
Relax a bit!
He's so intense!

874
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,260
- Ready...
- Look at his glare...

875
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,410
Go!

876
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,310
We got him!

877
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,680
[Yong Hwa didn't pull the trigger]

878
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,630
- Shoot now!
- He has to shoot!

879
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,700
Go again!
Replay!

880
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,180
- We won this round!
- No, this is undetermined.

881
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,060
- No, we won!
- This is vague.

882
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,960
[You're the one that didn't shoot!]

883
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,240
Do it again!

884
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,710
This is nonsense!
Hey, don't do it again!

885
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,220
Are you going to hit me?
Then hit me!

886
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,720
Then come with me.

887
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,900
I need a camera!
Follow me!

888
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,070
- I need a camera!
[Save me, camera!]

889
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,350
You have to do it right!

890
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,380
You were supposed to
follow me!

891
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,530
So, 3:0?

892
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,780
- What are you doing?
- We have to do it again.

893
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,770
- We won!
- It's not certain.

894
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,320
It was certain.
It was very certain.

895
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,510
Let's do it again.

896
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,370
Il Woo lifted this,
and he lifted that!

897
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:32,410
- That's a round!
- But Yong Hwa didn't shoot!

898
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,840
Come with me!

899
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,480
- Jae Suk!
[Save the Big-nosed Brother!]

900
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,160
Cameramen!
Follow them!

901
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,710
[They'd live in fear
if cameras were not around...]

902
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,250
He didn't pull the trigger!

903
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,000
[He objects with his back turned]

904
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,300
- Fine, then...
- Don't touch it, mister!

905
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,200
- At least we can do this.
[The game should be fair...]

906
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,500
- This is not in the middle...
- Hey...

907
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,600
Do you want to come?

908
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,630
[At a loss for words]

909
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,780
[Where is he trying to bring
these men to?]

910
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,450
- You should just go with him and see.
- My pride is hurt.

911
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,670
Why don't you just go?
Let's see what happens.

912
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,050
My teammates need me,
so I can't leave right now.

913
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,330
[No rematch]
[Team of Seven 0:3 Team of Three]

914
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,970
They arrived almost at the same time.

915

[Team of Three only needs
one more win]

916
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,800
- This should come this way...
- This has to be aligned here!

917
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,710
- Do you see this cross?
- But it's near here.

918
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,190
[Big Nosed Brother is moving
the starting line]

919

- What's the score right now?
- 3:0!

920
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,660
- We only need one more win!
[Absolutely clueless]

[The construction work is done
after moving the line about a foot ahead]

[Ours is an alleyway
while theirs is a highway!]

924

[Ji Hyo vs. Il Woo]

You're on this round?

927

Just wrap it up!

928
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,600
If you win, you'll take this round.

929
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,810
Just go cry, Ji Hyo.

930
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,090
- Fighting!
[Startled]

931
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,980
Wait!

932
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,870
- It already started!
- There's no waiting!

933
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:25,140
It's your fault for not catching his
foot crossing the starting line!

934
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,700
Will you really not focus on
the game like this?

935
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,720
I'm focused!

936
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,660
Go!

flipping the water gun]

I'm sorry, Il Woo!

949

[Why are we filming a romance
variety show all of a sudden?]

She really cleaned his teeth.

Things like that are not cool these days.
It worked maybe ten years ago...

953

You have to shoot at
people to be cool these days!

954
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,280
I think he did that because
he could afford it...

955

not to step on the start line.]

might be able to flip the game!]

Oddly, I feel like even
I'll be able to win.

972

- Bring me a tape measure.

closer, but they're letting it slide this time.]

in a hurry.]

1041

We must find it quickly.
Go here.

1042
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,520
- Did you look here before?
[What are they trying to find?]

[Someone's chasing them
with a bell!]

- Mr. Producer...

<i>Once you have all the letters, you must
put them together on the platform outside.</i>

1068

<i>That'll constitute your victory.</i>

1069
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,180
So our name tags don't matter?

1070
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,910
[Team of Three can't be ousted even
if they lose their name tag.]

1071
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,390
- You're truly blessed.
[They have to oust the other seven.]

1072
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,860
Not having such pressure on you
will get you an extra year of life!

Seriously.

1078
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,270
<i>Then, the other one is...</i>

1079

1080

<i>The second letter is "A" from U.S.A.</i>

1087

<i>So you have two letters so far.</i>

[Team of Three has an "R"
from "World."]

1089

- Right here...
[Team of Three is hiding their letter]

Under the water tray?

1091
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,170
We can put it in like this...

1092
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,440
[They chose a spot under
the water tray of a water purifier.]

1093
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,070
This is a good idea.

1094
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,180
They're probably hiding the letter
at a very difficult spot.

1095

The key right now is finding their letter.

1096

the whole place to find it, right?

1097

will instill fear in the opposition]

the costume room.]

1154
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,510
I don't think they'll come to this side.

Wow...
Why are there...

- Bells everywhere?
[On repeat over and over again]

1162

I found an "M."

1166

Six more to go.

1169
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,260

[I'll be quick, Ji Hyo.]

1186
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:49,360

[No mercy from this guy!]

1188

[Song Ji Hyo, out!]

1189

- Yes.
- Really?

1195

You're unstoppable!

1196
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,970
[His laugh is even scarier.]

1197
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,850
- I'm just walking around.
- Why?

1198
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,980
I can't see anyone.

1199
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,760
How can I just be walking around
alone like an invisible man?

1200

[Big-nosed Brother is going
to another building.]

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,070
You startled me!

1204
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,810
[No!]

1205
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:49,820
[It's really startling this time!]

1206
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,850
[Caught Big-nosed Brother
at the speed of light!]

1207
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,380
- I'll give you some information.
- Like what?

1208
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,930
If I help you to catch Jae Suk,
will you let me go?

1209
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,540
Where are you, Jae Suk?

1210
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,520
[I'm sorry Jae Suk,
but you'll have to sacrifice...]

1211
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,640
<i>Where are you, Jae Suk?</i>

1212
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,390
[Every single cell in his body is
telling him not to answer this call...]

1213
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,620
- Who do you want?
- You're abandoned by the team.

1214
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,660
That's not true.

1215
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,280
I love you, Suk Jin.

1216
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,530
Ji Suk Jin, out.

1217
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,750
- He's really trying hard.
[Il Woo's stellar ousting surprises Kkuk.]

1218
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,280
Where could it be?

1219
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,480
- I must do something too.
[Giraffe has contributed 0% to his team.]

1220
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,950
How did I get caught here?

1221
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,290
- Hey...
- I'm already out.

1222
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,800
You're the first blue team member
I've seen so far.

1223
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,310
I'm just aimlessly walking around.

1224
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,150
- You saw no one?
- No one.

1225
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,210
- Il Woo got you?
- He got everyone.

1226
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,440
- All four of them so far...
- Where is Jong Kook?

1227
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,370
- Jong Kook is walking around too.
- In the main building?

1228
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:06,030
- I guess I haven't seen him either.
[Kkuk is staying in the main building]

1229
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:08,780
Jong Kook in the main building!

1230
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,150
Kwang Soo is in between
the main building and the annex.

1231
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:16,760
[It took some time for
Giraffe to catch on]

1232
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,810
Il Woo is in the annex.

1233
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:21,430
- Let go of my radio!
[Give me your radio!]

1234
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,140
I'm already out!

1235
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,890
- Why are you taking this away?
[Fighting someone who's already out]

1236
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,840
Hey, hey!

1237
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,930
[I'm going to hunt too!]

1238
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,540
Oh, my God!

1239
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,280
[He almost fainted because
he was startled by the same team.]

1240
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,340
You're okay.
You're on my team.

1241
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:50,500
- Stand up.
[This must be how the other team feels.]

1242
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:52,930
[Meanwhile, Team of Seven is...]

1243
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,240
[Peeking]

1244
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,450
Not here.

1245
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,270
This might be a good place to hide it.
But they didn't.

1246
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,230
This is really scary.

1247
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,580
I can just keep hearing those bells.

1248
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,450
- Am I hearing things now?
[The side effect of this game: Auditory illusion]

1249
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,370
I keep hearing the bells.

1250
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,920
[That one is real!]

1251
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,220
[That way!]

1252
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:47,760
[Jae Suk runs opposite of
the bell sound.]

1253
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,900
[Running to the costume room.]

1254
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,440
[Barely got away...]

1255
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,920
[Could it be...]

1256
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,860
Mr. Yoo Jae Suk?

1257
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,190
[Were you hiding there?]

1258
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,530
[His thick arm comes in]

1259
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,010
I knew because I heard the door.

1260
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,770
- But really...
- There's no way out...

1261
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,920
Are you trying to push
this door right now?

1262
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,010
I don't have any other way.

1263
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,210
- But are you really trying right now?
- I can't go anywhere else now!

1264
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,730
Excuse me, sir...

1265
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,540
- Are you really trying your best?
[Really sad]

1266
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,170
I'm sorry, but...

1267
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:43,460
You do realize how obnoxious
you were today, right?

1268
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:47,750
Are you going to hit me?
Hit me, then!

1269
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,410
I need a camera!
Follow me!

1270
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,080
[He didn't know it would all
come down to this...]

1271
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,950
My team must win!

1272
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,150
- You can't!
- We must win!

1273
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,980
No!

1274
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,750
I feel lucky.
See you later!

1275
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:17,460
Gwon Yeol...
Why did you shut the door so hard?

1276
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,310
Why are you even more
scared than me?

1277
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,320
I'm scared too...

1278
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,370

1279
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,950

Haroro and Hong Ki.]

[They must quickly find the other letters
to complete "Running Man!"]

1281
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,390
[I've missed you, alphabet!]

1282
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:55,200
I found it at a nonsensical place.

1283
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,510
[Five letters remaining]

1284
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,970
[Riding on this wave to the next letter...]

1285
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,460
Oh, my God!

1286
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:08,950
[Finds Kkuk right after finding a letter.]

1287
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,180
This shouldn't be the way.

1288
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,510
[I think I'm next, Hong Ki...]

1289
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,100
I felt like you'd be here.

1290
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,800
- Open the door.
[Kwang Soo joins]

1291
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,500
[His first time seeing a surviving
member of the opposition.]

1292
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,110
You don't have to be here.
Go.

1293
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,810
[Feeling small]

1294
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,230
- They're avoiding me.
[Still zero contribution today.]

1295
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,080
No, you can't!

1296
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,580
[Devastating]

1297
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:41,980

[But two beasts!]

1316

anything all day...]
