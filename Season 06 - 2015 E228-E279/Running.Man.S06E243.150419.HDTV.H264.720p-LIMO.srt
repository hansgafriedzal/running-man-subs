- Wow, it's really been a long time.
- Was my dance okay?

144
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,550
There's no space.

145
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,040
Let's do this.
One person at a time...

146
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,380
do a vote, and whisper it in my ear.
Alright?

147

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,770
[Hot guy No. 3, with the big eyes...]

174
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,020
[is feeling very cold.]

175
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,270
I'll see who this person is...

176
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,340
We can't take all the guests in.
Who is that?

177
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,040
[A rendezvous with hot guy No. 3.]

178
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,280
- He looks like an idol?
- He's fashionable.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,840
Show us your face.

180
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,380

Ho Jun!
What do we do with him?

188
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,710
He's too popular.

189
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,240
[He brings the sandwiches
for extra points.]

190
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,470
If we take all the popular people
that team only has weak people.

191
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,270
[We can't just take all the aces.]

192
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,550
You stay here.

193
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,320

[Collection No. 3, Son Ho Jun.]

195

Poor Ho Jun.

196
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,870
We need some hot guys
on that team too.

[The car leaves...]

198
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,100
[They didn't take him
because he was too hot.]

199
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,520
I need to be more active...

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,840
[The weather's cold too...]

201
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,990
- It's Ho Jun!
- Oh, it's Ho Jun.

They took all the guests up 'til now.

204

- Have you eaten?
- Sandwiches!

205

- We don't want to just take anyone.
[Active Ho Jun.]

206
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,820
- He's giving us sandwiches.
- My wife is your fan.

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,350
Wow, sandwiches.
Why did they leave you?

208
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,020
- I wasn't active enough?
- Really?

209
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,440
He even has tears in his eyes.

210
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,320
I'll try my best, please let me in.
It's so cold.

211
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,150
- Ho Jun is an ace.
- Get in.

212
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,000
- Why didn't they take Ho Jun?
- Why didn't they take you?

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,040
What are they doing?

214
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,350
- Ho Jun.
- Yes?

215
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,190
I think you're really handsome.

216
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,620
The sandwiches are frozen as ice.

217
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,370
The coffee's cold.

218
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,870
Ho Jun, we can't just take
anyone from now on.

219
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,670
- I'm so angry.
- Let's take revenge.

220
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,350
Turn the light on so
Ho Jun's face can be seen.

221
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,470

Who are you?

229
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,140
Who are you?

230
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,520
[Dangerously attractive guy,
Hong Jong Hyun.]

[Look at his smile.]
- Isn't it Jong Hyun?

236
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
His face doesn't even swell
even though it's early.

237
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,970
Can I get in?
I'll ride in the trunk.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,700
[Jong Hyun...
pick Jong Kook...]

239
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,700
Not me.

240
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,350
I drive really well.

What are you doing, Jong Hyun?
Stop him.

- Push him, push.

Please take care of my dog.

250
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,640
You think you will stay
in there forever?

251
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,650
Hey! You think you'll be
in there forever?

We don't just take anyone.

257
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm sorry for before.

258

Ho Jun, I...
let's talk inside.

259
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,970
- What do you mean inside?
- Suk Jin, I'll drive.

Yes, there he is.

267
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,840
Is he homeless?

Is he a foreigner?

272
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,440
Foreigner?
No, his hands look Korean.

273
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,060
- Show us your face!

276
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,070
Byung Jae!

277

[A variety show screenwriter
who can act and do gags.]

278
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,200
- He's good.
- Why are your eyes so shaky?

279
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,750
<i>I'll confess.
Your girlfriend is ugly.</i>

280
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,070
[The blue-chip icon,
Yoo Byung Jae.]

281
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,700

- What do we do?
- You choose one person.

290
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,740
Decide who you want to pick.

291
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,840
I choose Kang Kyun Sung.

292
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,360
[Kang Kyun Sung]

293
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,240
I kicked out Suk Jin before,
and I have to see him again?

Ho Jun, hurry and close the door!

299
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
- Close it.
- Help me out.

300
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,900
Why are you letting him in?

301
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,600
- How did a guest get kicked out?
- Kim Kook Jong should have been out.

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Are we the leftovers?

303
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,550
- What do you mean leftover?
[Getting worked up.]

304
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,160
Ho Jun, this is the ace team.

305
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,170
This is a gathering for people
who get jealous.

[Self-comfort for being thrown away.]

307
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,540
Welcome, Byung Jae!

308

You can leave the mask outside.

309
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,020
[From 'K' Exhibition center
to 'H' Village.]

310
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,050
[This village has special places?]

311
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,740
Where is it?

312
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,840
This is the entrance of the village.

313
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,140
It's so beautiful.

314
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,440
Come here, Byung Jae.
Where are you going, Byung Jae?

315
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,540
Why do you look so timid, Byung Jae?

316
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,240
<i>We'll have two teams with
six members each.</i>

317
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,100
<i>The team with seven members
need to send one member over.</i>

318
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,470
- Is that so?
- We have to match the numbers.

319
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,340
See? One person has to come.

320
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,170
Our character-theme is complete
if Byung Jae comes here.

321
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,640
It's only complete with Byung Jae here.

322
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
I can't send him.

323
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,750
Give us the youngest member.

324
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,480
What are you doing?

325
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,790
Wait.

326
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,970
Byung Jae wants to come!

327
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm pouring so much affection!

328
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,330
Byung Jae, come here.

329
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,330
Why won't you let him come?

330
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,550
[He's scary.]

331
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,440
Byung Jae's lips are dry!

332
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,250
Look at your members!

333
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,570
He's sensitive to cold.
You need to hold him tight.

334
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,070
I'll give you my jacket.

335
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,540
You'll regret it.

336
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,620
- It's cold.
[Kwang Soo gives his jacket.]

337
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,950
You look like Chow Yun-Fat
from 'A Better Tomorrow.'

338
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,300
It's the long coat from
'A Better Tomorrow'!

339
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,840
[Hot guys team vs. Cool guys team.]

340
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,790
You've made a big decision.

341
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,570
We have other good members, too.

342
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,170
Now you're smiling, Byung Jae!

343
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,750
[A bright smile he didn't have before.]

344
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,150
Leaving this team doesn't mean
we're not seeing each other.

345
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,720
[I feel more comfortable here.]

346
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,770
<i>I asked you a question before.</i>

347
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,920
<i>Where is the hot place in your life?</i>

348
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,810
<i>There were various answers.</i>

349
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,950
<i>We set up in this village
with the answers you've given us.</i>

350
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,740
<i>For today's Hottest Icon Race</i>

351
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,140
<i>you will be traveling around the
hot places and doing missions there.</i>

352
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,940
<i>The only thing different will be</i>

353
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,040
<i>the all-kill name tag mission.
- What this is...</i>

354
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,930
Byung Jae, you should leave.

355
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,770
You should have told us before!

356
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,120
[Some are happy, some are sad.]

357
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,840
What are you talking about?

358
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,340
Jong Kook!

359
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,550
Give us Jong Hyun or Gary.

360
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,720
- You don't like name tag elimination?
- No, I don't.

361
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,550
Choose one.
Name tag elimination or a fist fight?

362
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,400
What do you mean fist fight?

363
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,550
Just bring the leader.

364
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,350
- This guy!
- I'll face you.

365
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,400
- I want to go to that team.
- What?

366
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,390
He spilled his true feelings.

367
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,840
- What are you saying, Ho Jun?
[You never know.]

368
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>Here are the rules for the all-kill
name tag elimination.</i>

369
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,940
<i>You can only eliminate name tags
of the other team</i>

370
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,140
<i>in between games.</i>

371
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,800
- How?
- In between games?

372
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,800
<i>If you take all the name tags off,
you will win.</i>

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,400
<i>The team who wins a mission
will get a 10 second head start.</i>

374
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,700
That's too much time.

375
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,340
We have 10 seconds to run away.
We need to win all the missions.

376
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,860
<i>One team doesn't run away
while the other chases.</i>

377
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,100
<i>You face each other.</i>

378
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,370
No, we will chase them
and they will run.

379
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,040
<i>You will receive a 10 second head
start and a golden coin.</i>

380
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,740
<i>It's an advantage to win the mission.</i>

381
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,940
We have to win.

382
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,240
<i>The first place...</i>

383
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,670
<i>is Anyang billiard hall.</i>

384
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,450
[The first mission: Anyang billiard hall]

385
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,940
[What mission is waiting
for them at the hall?]

386
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,450
[Anyang billiard hall]

387
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,270
[The hottest place mission, start.]

388
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,660
[Anyang billiard hall.]

389
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,840
This must be Kim Jong Kook's
hot place.

390
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,750
It's Anyang.
Jong Kook lives in Anyang.

391
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,840
- It's Anyang!
- Anyang billiard hall!

392
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,300
[The materials are laid out.]

393
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,640
[Both teams enter with confidence.]

394
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,540
What is this?

395
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,120
It's a real billiard hall.

396
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,710
Why are the balls so big?

397
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,180
[Extreme size.]
It's like a bowling ball.

398
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,740
They are bowling balls.

399
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,320
We didn't play eight balls
back in my day.

400
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,500
It was introduced in the 90's.

401
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,850
People who studied abroad
started playing it.

402
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,290
- In the early 90's...
- In Apgujung-dong...

403
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,800
the orange tribe played it.

404
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,170
If you're under the 300 level,
do not perform Masse shots.

405
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,320
Call it a curved shot.

406
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,420
It doesn't feel like it
if I say curved shot.

407
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,200
Please, tell us the story
behind this place.

408
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,240
This is the place I picked.

409
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,940
Jong Kook is living in Anyang now,
but I used to live near Anyang.

410
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,150
At this Anyang billiard hall...

411
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,470
- I was in elementary...
- Did you get beat up?

412
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,300
I got my lunch money stolen.
At the Anyang billiard hall.

413
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,240
Why did you go to there when
you were in elementary school?

414
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,140
I was curious back then.

415
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,020
They didn't let elementary students in.

416
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,640
- You could go in.
- You could enter.

417
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,340
It was very popular back then.

418
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,200
You lived in good times.
We got in trouble for playing billiards.

419
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,940
I never got my money stolen.

420
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,570
But my jacket and shoes were
robbed many times.

421
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,440
There are a lot of victims here.

422
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,780
I've been robbed many times, too.

423
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,740
Byung Jae, have you ever
been robbed?

424
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,020
A half-eaten piece of a bun.

425
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,890
Did you prepare that comment?

426
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,440
Do you prepare comments
for every situation?

427
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,090
How did you say that right away?

428
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,840
The Pokemon bun used to
be popular.

429
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,150
They took it because
I didn't have money.

430
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,150
That's disgusting!

431
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,340
Well, this isn't related to eight ball.

432
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,440
- But let's reveal each others' level.
- I'm level 150.

433
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,880
Don't lie.

434
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,900
Gary's 250.

435
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,850
- How about you, Suk Jin?
- I'm around 80.

436
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,720
His level used to be 120 when
he played with me 10 years ago.

437
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,760
It decreased.

438
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,320
- What's your average score?
- About 150.

439
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,770
How about Byung Jae?

440
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,020
I'm level 30.
I've never played billiards.

441
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,900
He's no help.

442
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,850
You look like you would've spent
all your time playing billiards!

443
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,440
Have you been living under a rock?

444
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,040
- What's your score?
- I'm 30.

445
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,850
- You've never played?
- Really.

446
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,310
You've never played?

447
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,300
When my friends went to
play billiards, I went on dates.

448
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,670
[Surprised.]

449
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,170
Why do I feel like I lost at games?

450
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,120
Mister, please wipe the table for us.

451
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,540
[Automatically becomes a worker.]

452
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,550
You have to wipe the rail.

453
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,300
[Winner gets 10 golden coins
and a head start.]

454
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,840
Those were good times.

455
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,140
I play, even now.

456
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,940
If we win and get a head start...

457
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,670
We need to win no matter what,
and run away quickly.

458
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,390
- Is it better?
- Yes. That's better.

459
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,740
Our name tags will be ripped off
if we attack them.

460
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,990
You can put it down and roll it.

461
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,940
[Get the balls inside the pocket
by throwing the cue ball.]

462
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,740
What's happening?

463
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,270
[After the first crash,
it hits no. 2.]

464
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,940
[Will it go in at once?]

465
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,840
What's happening?

466
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,020
The next one is right here, Ji Hyo.
Just push it.

467
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,340
Isn't this her first time?
Why is she so good?

468
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,070
Just push this one.

469
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,040
- She's probably done it before.
- Probably.

470
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,040
You can do it!

471
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,840
A little hard.

472
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,440
Like that!

473
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,520
[This time as well?]

474
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,020
[That was close.]

475
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,720
[Cool guys team - 4 and 6.
Hot guys team - 1, 3, and 5.]

476
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,940
How do you hit this?

477
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,740
Kyun Sung, it's your turn.

478
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,800
- Me?
- Your level is 40, right?

479
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,220
[40? Had he played billiards before?]

480
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,240
- Where did Kyun Sung go?
- Kyun Sung, you can push...

481
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,850
What are you doing, Kyun Sung?

482
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,080
- We need to run away later.
- What's wrong with my team members?

483
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,540
They're too tight!

484
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,740
[How will he play the name tag
elimination with those weak legs?]

485
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,620
- We'll need to run later.
- All they think about is running away.

486
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,560
Why did you tie them so tight?

487
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,200
- With the white ball...
- Oh, this one?

488
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
If you hit it wrong, the cue ball
might go in as well.

489
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,370
You need it to hit it toward
this side, about 90%.

490
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,270
Like this, right?
Like this?

491
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,200
- That's right.
- No, no.

492
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
[In the midst of all this chaos.]

493
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,270
[Finally, hits.]

494
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,070
[It went in.]

495
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,820
[Kyun Sung's surprising result, 1 in.]

496
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,450
It's right here!

497
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,540
- Ball no.3 is possible.
- Wait, Kyun Sung!

498
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,670
- Slightly to the right.
- Like this?

499
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,340
[Kyun Sung's confident second shot.]
- That's right.

500
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,420
[Hits the the rail, and fails.]
- It's our turn.

501
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,100
Let's hope for the cue ball goes in.

502
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,520
That's never going to happen.

503
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,240
- Don't do that.
- What are you doing?

504
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,740
It'll never go in, Gary.

505
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,240
- It won't, right?
- It might.

506
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,470
[Ball no. 6 goes in.]
- It goes in!

507
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,550
[Followed by the cue ball.]
- It went in!

508
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,900
[You said it would never happen.]

509
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,440
It's okay.

510
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,340
- We have to take it out, right?
- Yeah.

511
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,150
You're supposed to take it out
if the cue ball goes in.

512
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,420
<i>That's different
between neighborhoods.</i>

513
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,600
- They didn't take it out in Jamsil!
- This is my billiard hall!

514
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,140
Take it out, now.

515
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,350
[And it goes in the center.]
- Jong Hyun knows the rule.

516
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,140
Don't come on the pool table.

517
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,770
Jae Suk, put some chalk.

518
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,050
That's too much!

519
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,140
What do you mean, too much?

520
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,520
Next time, put some here.

521
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,440
We need to run away as soon
as we get a head start, okay?

522
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,870
If you make us unhappy,
I'll eliminate you first.

523
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,440
Failure, failure!

524
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,200
[It's in the right direction.]

525
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,300
[Failed by an inch.]

526
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,170
- Next!
- That was close!

527
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,840
- Is it short?
- It's short.

528
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,340
I thought you don't play billiards.

529
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,340
- This is too hard.
- Just look here and take a shot.

530
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,270
Make it spin.

531
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,140
Do you want to hit this one?

532
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,820
- This one?
[He changes the target.]

533
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,840
- No, it's too hard.
- Hard?

534
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,630
Just try it.
It might be easier.

535
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,440
[He tries to shoot a bank shot.]

536
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,920
I don't know how much
the ball will curve.

537
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,970
Don't make the angle too wide.

538
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,840
- Show us an artistic shot.
- We should try a variety of shots.

539
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,940
- It goes in!
[Hits the the rail first.]

540
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,880
[It's heading towards
the right direction.]

541
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,900
It goes in!

542
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,500
[It went in!]

543
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,220
[What's with this guy?]

544
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,550
[Ha Ha, succeeds with ball no. 4.]

545
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,440
Pay close attention!
If we lose, our name tags are gone!

546
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,850
[Swallow.]

547
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,340
I need to look at that spot.

548
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,940
Good!

549
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,010
[Rolls away perfectly...]

550
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,340
[and hits no. 6.]

551
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,580
It got caught!

552
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,540
[It hits the the rail, and fails.]

553
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,700
Good, good!

554
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,540
Go up, Ho Jun.

555
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,300
- Ho Jun!
- Our plan...

556
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,100
Good job.

557
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,240
- Here first.
- Think of it as pushing it to the rail.

558
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,130
Don't think about running away.

559
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,540
Don't tighten your laces.

560
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,340
Ho Jun, just take a light shot.

561
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,050
- You mean cutting it, right?
- Yeah, cut it!

562
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,870
Just slightly!

563
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,870
[The cue ball is heading
towards the pocket.]

564
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,570
- Good.
- That's good!

565
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,250
[No!]

566
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,200
[Go in, go in.]

567
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,940
It's going in. It's going to fall.

568
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,970
[The cue ball is hidden
between the rail.]

569
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,170
That's amazing.
Ho Jun, you're amazing.

570
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,640
This is hard.
Don't worry Jae Suk.

571
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,540
- It's really hard.
- We're ruined.

572
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,140
Just think of it as pressing
it against the rail.

573
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,000
- That's it?
- Don't tie your laces.

574
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,050
Why are you all tying your laces?

575
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,920
[Getting ready to flee.]

576
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,000
Soo Won, go this way.

577
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,520
[If they get this last one,
Cool Guys team wins.]

578
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,570
[All eyes on the ball.]

579
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,150
It goes in, it goes in!

580
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,120
[Failed.]

581
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,250
We're alive!
Untie your laces!

582
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,800
[Just like their shoe laces,
their hearts tighten and loosen.]

583
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:13,940
- We need a curved ball.
- It's Byung Jae's turn.

584
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,440
Don't try avoiding it!

585
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,320
Why did you tie them so tight?

586
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You have zippers on the side!

587
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,250
[There was a zipper.]

588
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,070
These aren't my shoes.

589
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,740
He's never received
a sponsorship before.

590
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,740
He came with a close friend
because he doesn't have a manager.

591
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,200
But his friend was so funny.

592
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,500
'I'm going to be bored
when you're shooting.'

593
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,120
Because he'll be alone.

594
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,940
- He's not a manager.
- It's first time for him waiting.

595
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,040
He didn't even have breakfast.

596
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,050
He felt awkward eating with our staff.

597
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,250
He's very shy.

598
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,050
It's his first time seeing
other managers.

599
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,100
- Byung Jae, over there.
- Okay.

600
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,570
- Can you point it out for me?
- Point it out.

601
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,420
[He has no experience
and he's easily influenced]

602
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,840
- Yeah, the other way.
- No, this way.

603
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,470
- Counter clock wise!
- Tell me when you're decided.

604
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,240
Why are you so sensitive, Byung Jae?

605
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,210
You did it right the first time.
To the right.

606
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,340
[His very first shot in his life.]

607
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,950
Good!

608
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,970
[Hits the rail]

609
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,900
[and hits it perfectly.]

610
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,870
- Byung Jae!
- Byung Jae!

611
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,400
[It went in!]

612
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,550
[Revival.]

613
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,400
[Everyone's surprised
with his miraculous first shot.]

614
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,370
Loosen your laces!

615
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,740
[Cool guys team - no. 6,
and Hot Guys team - no. 5.]

616
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,340
Byung Jae...
[He's giving out tips on the table.]

617
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,640
- You need to hit it like this.
- I have to hit the right side, right?

618
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,550
You became one with the table.

619
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,250
To the right, at an acute angle.

620
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,070
[If they get this in,
the Hot Guys team wins.]

621
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,540
Imagine the cue ball hits the rail.

622
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,620
- Do I hit it hard or lightly?
- Hard.

623
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,600
- Not too hard, though.
- But a little hard.

624
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,740
Think about it.

625
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,300
It can't be too hard nor too weak.

626
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,620
- Play it by ear.
- Do what you want.

627
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,120
You need to put it in a pocket.
That's what we want!

628
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
I thought you were swearing.

629
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,940
[Surprised.]
- Me, too.

630
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,480
It's because his name is Byung Jae.

631
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,120
- Byung Jae!
- Byung Jae!

632
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,570
[Will this beginner's luck continue?]

633
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,700
[Please, get in!]

634
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,040
- Great!
- It's going in!

635
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,350
[Oh my god!]

636
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,020
- Byung Jae!
- Yoo Byung Jae!

637
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,920
[A player that's level 30 leads
them to a miraculous win!]

638
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,890
[Untie your shoe laces!]

639
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,500
[Hot guys team vs. Cool Guys team]
[1: 0]

640
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,800
[Kwang Soo will execute
the first break shot.]

641
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,950
- Pocket two balls.
- We can win this.

642
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,600
Let's finish this quick and run away.

643
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,040
I think you should hit in the middle.
They will split no. 4 and no. 6.

644
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,140
Break the center.

645
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,440
Good, good!

646
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,740
- Nice!
- Good Job, Kwang Soo!

647
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,320
It's going in.
Number four!

648
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,500
[Hot Guys team succeeds
at pocketing no. 4.]

649
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,140
- That's it, Kwang Soo!
- Try number two!

650
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,970
We need to run away!

651
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,240
Move aside!

652
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,040
Control your power.

653
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
You're my number one target.
I'll only chase you!

654
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,740
Move aside, please!

655
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,040
Roll it along the rail.

656
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:29,640
- Hit it hard.
- No, not too hard.

657
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,300
[Kwang Soo succeeds with
two balls at his reminiscing place.]

658
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,650
Finish it, Kwang Soo.
Hurry up!

659
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,670
Why are you hiding
the ball from our sight?

660
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,920
I think you tried to hide the cue ball.

661
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,220
[The eldest brother is honest,
but he's not helping.]

662
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,740
- You're very honest.
- Of course, I am.

663
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,900
[They'll win if he pockets the ball.]

664
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,450
[There's only one ball left.]
- I'll strike it now.

665
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,500
That looks good!

666
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,450
[Will it go in?]

667
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,600
[It stops.]
Please!

668
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,470
[But it stays at a very good spot.]

669
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,510
It's even better.

670
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,870
We just need to hit
one fifth degrees to the right.

671
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,280
He always says one fifth degrees.

672
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,140
What should I hit?

673
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,140
[Cool Guys team - no. 1, 3, 5.]
[Hot Guys team - no. 6.]

674
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,340
Really strong?

675
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,140
That's nice!

676
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,440
Ji Hyo, I told you to throw it hard.

677
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,420
[Failed]
- It worked for us!

678
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,640
[Hot Guys team is one step
away from winning.]

679
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,150
[He's the one to finish the game.]
- Kyun Sung!

680
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,040
Just hit it from here.
It's going to go in.

681
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,150
- If you succeed...
- You know how it is, right?

682
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,920
Hit the right side slightly.

683
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,840
- What if the cue ball goes in?
- Just hit the right side.

684
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,020
- Hit the right side slightly.
- Just do it however you like.

685

[Failed]

687
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,550
[We're ruined!]

688

[His face explains it all.]

689
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,750
[I'm sorry.]
- How can you fail at it?

690
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,370
[Cool guys team, Gary's attack.]
- Number one!

691
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,840
- This one makes it scatter.
- I'll strike it now.

692
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,850
Good, good!
That's a clean shot!

693
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,150
[Gary's clean strike.]

694
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:00,600
[He succeeds at no. 5 on the bounce.]

695
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,170
[The Gamble Master,
Gary makes the match tied.]

696
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,640
Do you know what you did to us?

697
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,700
Tie your shoe laces.

698
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,440
[The atmosphere turned around.]
- Tie your shoe laces!

[Both the teams have
only one ball left.]

700
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,150
- That's a little too weak.
- It'll stop here.

701
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,400
- It stopped!
- It's over.

702
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,100
Suk Jin, finish it.

703
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,360
If we can't finish it,
we'll be finished!

704
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,000
This is the only chance!

705
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,350
- Who's next?
- It's Ha Ha.

706
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,600
[Will Ha Ha finish this game?]

707
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,920
[Is he performing a fireball?]

708
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,320
[What a narrow escape!]

709
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,620
[Jong Hyun plays this time.]
- Try hit this part.

710
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,200
Okay!

711
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,150
[Completely ruined.]

712
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,740
- You try, Byung Jae.
[They put the hero of the first round.]

713
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,100
Byung Jae, you're the best player.

714
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,070
This isn't that easy.

715
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,670
[It's a little far.]
- You can do it, Byung Jae.

716
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,450
90% to the right, you know...

717
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,090
Be careful.
Focus!

718
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,550
- It's the same as the last round.
- I see.

719
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,540
It's the same situation.

720
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,830
Good, good!

721
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,650
[The result of the first game
hangs on this ball.]

722
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,520
[Gary grabs the ball but...]
- What are you doing?

723
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,400
[they still succeed at it!]

724
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,200
[Super hero, Byung Jae]
- Yoo Byung Jae!

725
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,270
[It feel even worse
to lose against Byung Jae.]

726
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,070
- Yoo Byung Jae!
- We can run away now.

727
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,340
[Wait and See!]
- Pay for the game for us.

728

the winner, Hot Guys team.</i>

729

<i>Here are five coins for
the losers, Cool Guys team.</i>

730
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,320
Having ten coins are good
only if you can survive.

731
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,740
If you can't survive, what good
is having ten coins?

732

you have five minutes...</i>

That's my hot place.

<i>Meantime, you can oust
the other team's members.</i>

736
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,240
<i>If you eliminate everyone's name tag,
that'll be the end of the race.</i>

737

<i>Go to the next site before
your name tag gets eliminated.</i>

738
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,650
<i>You'll see a taped area
and that's the safe zone.</i>

739
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,320

- To your right!

[They don't even think
about ousting the other team.]

- Hurry!
- Where is it?

746

- Where it is?
- Go over there!

Are they chasing us?
Where are they now?

- Is it that building?

who came for the date.

815

must have taken the blame.

00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,920
I'll tell you what...
15 boys from my class went there

817
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,120
- and I was within top five.
- Stop that nonsense!

821
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,970
- Did you pair up with someone?
- No.

822
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,910
It ended at the palace.

823
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,650
He must have played

Then why the heck were you there?

832
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,720
That was the original plan,
but we hijacked the occasion.

[You hijack some weird things...]

834
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,340

835
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,210
They were surprised that the boys
did not look like the pictures.

836
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,830
You hijacked that?
I can't believe you did that.

How about you, Gary?

838
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,960

839
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,390
So what happened?

840
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,830
- Nothing happened,
- Why?

841

I wasn't a popular boy...

842
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,290
- Why would you ask that?
- I'm sorry...

843
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,360
I admit I can be very cruel.

844
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,140
I wasn't a popular boy back then!

845
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,430
I think I can be very cruel!

846
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,270
- How about Jong Hyun?
- Look how relaxed he is!

847
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,560
I never went on a date like that.

848
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,610
It wasn't a thing amongst my friends.

849
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,130
For people like him,
girls just come to them like magnets!

850
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,970
You don't need to go on
these meetings.

851
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,090
Did girls give you letters and gifts
all the time?

852
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:04,240
- No, they didn't.
- Then how did they show their affection?

853
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,560
Too many questions!

854
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,330
[I don't know how
handsome men live...]

855
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:13,070
I did receive letters here and there.

856
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,670
I never received any letter
other than those chain letters.

857
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,300
[All the letters I got when I was young
were bills and the conscription notice...]

858
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,810
Walking down memory lane!

859
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,210
So what are we doing here?

860
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,040
A representative from each team
will hold a bomb.

861
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,240
The other team members will line up
and have a mechanical pencil relay.

862
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,520
Every member will try to take out
one mechanical pencil lead...

863
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,410
The first team that finishes wins!
Best out of three.

864
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,070
The losing team's bomb will blow up.

865
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,030
I haven't played this game in forever!

866
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,010
[A mechanical pencil relay, best of three!]

867
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,540
[The losing team's bomb will
blow up on the spot!]

868
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,850
Please bring in the bombs.

869
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,950
Suk Jin will hold our bomb.

870
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,460
You're the extra in the team.
Come here.

871
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,360
You guys... Just wait until
we extras get more power!

872
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,740
But until then, I must comply...
When we have the power, you're all done!

873
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,600
- Ready?
- Yes.

874
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,880
- One at a time, right?
- The person before you must finish first.

875
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,530
So the losing team's bomb goes off?

876
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,680
You must win, guys.

877
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,820
- Let's try our best!
- Okay!

878
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,220
Fighting!

879
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,150
[If they lose, their departure
will be delayed by 10 seconds.]

880
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,080
[Speed is everything,
the mechanical pencil relay!]

881
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,000
- I think we got this!
[Kwang Soo vs. Ha Ha]

882
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,790
[The difference is as big as
that of their heights.]

883
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,530
What are you doing?

884
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,590
[Why is that Giraffe so fast?]

885
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,050
- Hey, Dong Hoon!
[Kwang Soo is successful!]

886
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,760
- Hey, Dong Hoon!
[Kyun Sung vs. Ha Ha]

887
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,360
[This lead is no ordinary lead.]

888
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,590
I think Jong Kook is going to
beat him up!

889
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,560
Done!

890
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,250
We're ahead!
[Kyun Sung vs. Jong Hyun]

891
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,980
- We won!
[Kyun Sung makes it!]

892
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,120
But should I be happy or not
about your pending victory?

893
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,030
[The extra gets some gold coins too
if his team wins!]

894
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,800
- Okay!
- They're catching up!

895
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,630
[Jong Hyun finishes]

896
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,620
[Ho Joon vs. Ji Hyo]

897
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,340
- Fighting, boys!
[Ho Joon finishes]

898
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,610
No matter how powerful Jong Kook is,
that's not going to help with this.

899
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,260
Just a bit more!
[Byung Jae vs. Ji Hyo]

900
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,070
- We got this!
[Ji Hyo finishes]

901
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,010
[Biting his lips!]

902
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:00,190
- Come on, Byung Jae!
[Byung Jae vs Jong Kook]

903
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,060
He's good at this too...

904
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,800
[I'm Mr. Capable!]

905
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,430
Go, Byung Jae!

906
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,160
[Jae Suk, the last one, starts!]

907
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,840
[Just you wait, grasshopper...]

908
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,490
- He's good at this too!
[Jae Suk vs. Jong Kook]

909
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,270
- I don't know who will win anymore!
[Soo Won will finish off]

910
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,500
- This is so close!
[Jae Suk vs. Soo Won]

911
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,520
Oh no!

912
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,000
[The game is dead close thanks to
Jong Kook and Soo Won!]

913
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,730
- Almost there!
- Come on!

914
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,790
[Head to head]

915
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:50,160
[Who will be the winner?]

916
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,390
- You must win, Jae Suk!
[Jae Suk vs. Soo Won]

917
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,140
[Jang Soo Won wins!]

918
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
[Hot Guys 0:1 Cool Guys]

919
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,750
The key is pressing it with your palm.

920
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,860
Jong Kook is no joke.
He's even good at this too!

921
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,490
[Kook and Soo Won contributed
to the flipping of the game!]

922
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,760
Do it with your palm.

923
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,360
We're going to lose at this rate.

924
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,960
We must win.
If we lose here, we're done!

925
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,280
Total annihilation!

926
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,140
[They might have to leave
10 seconds late...]

927
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,410
[The Cool Guys are reorganizing
their line-up.]

928
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,560
The fastest guy has to go first.
You're the fastest, right?

929
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,390
Kyun Sung is fast too.

930
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,000
You should go last, then.

931
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,220
[Speedy Kyun Sung will go last.]

932
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,930
Look!
I can be pretty fast!

933
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,850
[The big-nosed extra
is showing off his skills]

934
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,880
I'll take over the spot
of the slowest one.

935
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,890
- Take my spot.
- I'm on fire!

936
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,050
I'm really on fire!

937
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,390
We must win!

938
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,380
[Will the Big-nosed Brother lead
his team to victory?]

939
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,790
[Second Round of the
Mechanical Pencil Relay.]

940
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,700
Please take your spots.

941
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,660
Help your neighbors!

942
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,690
- Fighting, everyone!
[Enthusiastic Big-nose goes first.]

943
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,650
Fighting!

944
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,680
Faster!

945
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,720
[Big-nosed Brother...
You're slow!]

946
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,370
Why is he so slow?

947
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,450
Ji Hyo is super fast!

948
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,050
- Let's go, Ji Hyo!
[A breakneck speed!]

949
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,370
- Faster!
[Suk Jin vs. Ji Hyo]

950
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,500
[Ji Hyo finishes]

951
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,380
What is he doing right now?

952
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:41,090
[Kwang Soo vs. Jong Kook]

953
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,430
- That's great, Kwang Soo!
[The unstoppable Giraffe catches up!]

954
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,010
[Jong Kook finishes]

955
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,020
[And Kwang Soo finishes right after]

956
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,920
[Dead close]

957

- Focus...

[Fast and furious,
just like a car race!]

960

smallest mistake can lead to defeat!]

[Four runners have finished
almost at the same time!]

967
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:32,030
- Kyun Sung, please!
[Kyun Sung vs. Soo Won]

968
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,620
[The whole game depends on these two!]

969
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,380
[Will it be Kang Kyun Sung
the Speedy...]

[Or the machine man,

[Kyun Sung vs. Soo Won]

973

[The winning team gets 10 gold coins.]
[The losing team gets 5 gold coins.]

979
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,610
So, you have five minutes to reach
the next destination

980
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,850
which is an apartment building
in Shinwol 3-dong.

981

The Cool Guys get a head start of
10 seconds. Go ahead.

984
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,590
I'm counting to ten.

985
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,390
[Their name tags can be taken out
while moving to the next place]

986
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,200

get there on time, they'll be out!]

[Cool Guys 15:15 Hot Guys]

988

[Shinwol 3-dong Apartment]

989
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,370
We must find some other route.
Let's go that way.

990

[Going around to
avoid a possible ambush.]

991
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,990
We must be invisible.
They can't realize our plan.

992
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,810
The earth is round,
so we'll get there eventually...]

993
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:04,320
We have five minutes to get there.

994
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,920
We have to climb this mountain?

995
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,090
[A mountain of problems.]

996
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,520
So if we win, we must run fast,
and if we lose, we must run far.

997
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,540
Do you think this is the right way?

998
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,970
We might be ousted all together
in this mountain!

999
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,000
If we don't make it in five minutes!

1000
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,880
They're up there right now!
On the mountain!

1001

- What are they doing up there?
[The Cool Guys are strolling.]

- They're right there.
[The Cool Guys trying to find their way.]

1004

They saw us here.

1005
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,110
Then why did we come all the
way up here?

1006
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,640
- Don't get scattered.
[Going down before it's too late]

1007
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,630
That's the building right there!

1008
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,920
[The Cool Guys have located
the apartment building.]

1009
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,690
- I think they'll attack us near the building.
- Yes, I think so too.

1010
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,270
You're running out of time!

1011
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,610
Everyone will die!

1012
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,470
We'll die either way!

1013

There's no tomorrow for us!

1014
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:08,060
They're coming.
Let's go and wait.

1015
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,580
- To your right!
[Three minutes remaining]

1016
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,960
Where is it?

1017
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,720
[After an arduous journey...]
[Arrived at the apartment building!]

1018

- Come here, Ho Joon.
[Hitching a ride]

1019
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,220
Sir, may we get a ride to there?

1020
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,370
- Thank you!
[Approved]

1021
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,280
It's fine.

1022
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,600
- You can go ahead.
[At this rate, they'll all make it!]

1023
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,300
[Will their plan work?]

1024
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,280
You can just go straight.

1025
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,440
[A routine search, gentlemen.]

1026
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,120
Get out of there!
We're busy!

1027
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,890
We need at least one name tag.
You're safe, Kyun Sung.

1028
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,140
Let's negotiate.

1029
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,780
Give us Kwang Soo.

1030
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,260
Gentlemen!
Open the window at least.

1031
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,040
[With two minutes remaining,
some sort of decision is needed]

1032
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,890
- What will you do?
- Kyun Sung can pass.

1033
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,040
- Hold on...
[The door of negotiation is open]

1034
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,860
We'll let everyone through
except Kwang Soo.

1035
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,760
Why me?

1036
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
- Let us think about this.
- No time for that!

1037
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,390
He's sitting on the end!
How convenient!

1038
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,730
- You have less than a minute left!
[Lying about the time]

1039
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,180
This is crazy!

1040
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,730
- Go, Kyun Sung.
- We won't take your tag.

1041
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,950
[It seems like they're willing to
sacrifice Kwang Soo.]

1042
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,580
We really won't take your name tag.

1043
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,920
Move the car, please!

1044
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,150
[Big-nosed Brother is looking
for new recruits.]

1045
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,750
Go inside.
Do you want to go in or not?

1046
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,710
[Fighting against Kook is hopeless.]
[The best option is sacrificing Kwang Soo!]

1047
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,220
[20 seconds remaining]

1048
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,470
- Go inside.
[Byung Jae surrenders too]

1049
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,770
You can go, Jae Suk.
Just abandon Kwang Soo and go!

1050
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,540
- Do you want to die together then?
[Grasshopper is resisting]

1051
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,530
- Come on, let's go.
[10 seconds remaining]

1052
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,440
[You've fallen for our plan,
Kim Jong Kook!]

1053
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,320
[Giraffe and Grasshopper
turned into glue!]

1054
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,030
[Time over]

1055
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,300
- You should've listened to me!
[Thanks to their sacrifices, Kkuk is out.]

1056
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,790
We've ousted Jong Kook!

1057
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,220
[Jong Kook, Jae Suk, and Kwang Soo
are now extras.]

1058
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,310
[Cool Guys vs. Hot Guys]
[15:15]

1059
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:47,250
- How did this happen?
- I got a lot of friends now!

1060
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,120
[The Extra Brothers]

1061
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,070
This is my team now.

1062
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,280
Don't think of us as weak.

1063
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,510
Usually it takes more than three men
to get Jong Kook.

1064
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,350
We did pretty well.

1065
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,320
But even in my opinion, I think
it'll be a good match from now on.

1066
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,600
We should've gotten one more.

1067
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,730
<i>The extras can't win.</i>

1068
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,740
<i>There will be other perks,
but you won't be able to win.</i>

1069
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,970
<i>The Cool Guys have five people
and the Hot Guys three.</i>

1070
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:18,500
<i>So the two of the extras will join
the Hot Guys.</i>

1071
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,660
I'll join them.

1072
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,600
<i>If the Hot Guys win, only the extras
who participated in the game get the coins.</i>

1073
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,100
That's not fair!

1074
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,920
I'll do it!

1075
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,020
- This game is my all-time favorite!
[I can do well!]

1076
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,450
- The reason why I can do well is..
[The rules haven't been explained yet]

1077
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,690
You just ruined our game before, Mr. Ji.

1078
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,880
I'm the most experienced extra here.

1079
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,780
[The extras must consider seniority now?]

1080
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,430
- Can the team choose?
[Kkuk and Big-nosed Brother join by force]

1081
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,590
This is a public service announcement...
We're recruiting for the next class of extras...

1082
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,200
[Anyone can join as long as
your name tag is gone!]

1083
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,950
But let's first talk about
why we're here, Byung Jae.

1084
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,960
- There's a videotape!
- Why is it x-rated?

1085
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,150
What did you do in Shinwol-dong?

1086
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,980
[An apartment building in
Shinwol 3-dong...]

1087
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,520
[And an x-rated video...]

1088
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,690
[What could be his story?]

1089
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,670
I've been living with the guy who came
to visit just before for eight years.

1090
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:22,200
We used to be very poor, so we
could only afford to live in basements.

1091
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,840
Then he got a girlfriend,
and this is her place.

1092
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,380
This apartment?

1093
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,540
To me, it was the best place
I've ever lived in.

1094
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,110
So all three of us lived together...

1095
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,520
[Little too intimate!]

1096
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,800
Let's just say
you were there all the time.

1097
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,670
I lived in the apartment too.

1098
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:46,920
I had a separate room.

1099
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,130
[So you lived with your roommate's girlfriend?]

1100
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,330
The girlfriend was quite generous.
And then?

1101
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,190
Then she ended up cheating on him.

1102
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,050
[The landlady ended up getting
another boyfriend...]

1103
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,080
My roommate and I knew that
she was cheating.

1104
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,430
But we just pretended as if
we didn't know.

1105
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,240
[In fear of eviction, they
pretended as if they had no idea.]

1106
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,750
Otherwise they would've been kicked out!
The moment she knows that they know!

1107
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,130
I assume your roommate was in
an awkward position.

1108
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,500
So we lived like that for two months.

1109
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,780
My roommate kept ignoring his girlfriend
every time she tried to talk to him.

1110
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:26,880
[Love, hatred...]
[But survival triumphs them all!]

1111
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,670
This is a survival story!

1112
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,040
So in the end, he met up with
his girlfriend and her new boyfriend.

1113
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,260
I've been told that he got beaten up.

1114
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,710
Then we got evicted.

1115
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,370
So he got beaten up
then kicked out?

1116
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,130
There were four streams of blood
coming out of his nose.

1117
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,350
Is that even possible?

1118
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,220
Then what is this tape?

1119
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,260
So it was about how
the story could be x-rated.

1120
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,860
<i>The instructions are on the back.</i>

1121
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,990
The rules are as follows.

1122
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,360
Each team will sit in a row
facing each other.

1123
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,070
The defending team will move
the videotape behind their backs...

1124
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,060
Without giving any hint to
the opposition.

1125
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,440
The attacking team will try to locate
the videotape by asking questions.

1126
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,370
The defending team gets
30 seconds to move the videotape.

1127
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,140
The attacking team gets five minutes
for questioning.

1128
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,560
- So we must decide who will attack first.
- That's right.

1129
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,170
How should we decide that?

1130
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,750
- You can attack first.
- You can.

1131
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,840
- Okay!
[Toward the Hot Guys]

1132
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,520
We'll attack first.

1133
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,110
- 30 seconds to move the tape.
- Yes.

1134
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,790
We have to do it in the back.
We must get closer.

1135
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:35,470
Ready, set, go!

1136
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,260
<i>Where is my youth?</i>

1137
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,720
[The singing defense to
muffle the sound.]

1138
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:49,680
[Speedy delivery!]
[The tape is with Gary]

1139
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,560
[Hunting hawks]

1140
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,550
[Still blank, regardless]

1141
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,090
It's really hard to read Ji Hyo.

1142
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:02,810
The tape isn't with her.

1143
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,870
Why?

1144
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,860
I saw it through that gap.

1145
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,030
- Why did you see it?
[Disappointed]

1146
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,300
[Because it was showing...]

1147
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,400
- You should've been more careful!
[Byung Jae was just trying to win.]

1148
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,990
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

1149
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:22,910
You have it, don't you, Gary?

1150
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:28,170
Five, four, three, two, one.

1151
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,080
[The videotape moving is done]

1152
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,360
You have five minutes to question.

1153
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,550
So it went from here
to that side.

1154
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:41,680
I think it didn't go all the way.
It's probably somewhere in the middle.

1155
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,030
I think it's Gary...

1156
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,690
Why Gary?

1157
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,780
I'm pretty good at guessing in general.

1158
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,080
- Is that so?
[Son Ho Joon the Guessing King?]

1159
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,050
What did you guess in the past
that you got right?

1160
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,700
On my college admission exam

1161
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,800
the hardest math problem was the
last open-ended question.

1162
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,080
The one with the biggest weight.

1163
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,770
I guessed that right.
All the way to the decimals.

1164
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:03,790
Quite precise!

1165
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:06,430
The answer was 7.95.

1166
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,230
How is that even possible?

1167
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,400
So you just wrote 7.95?

1168
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,990
So I measured the figure
with my ruler...

1169
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:17,290
It seemed like it'd be more than seven,
but slightly less than eight.

1170
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,810
- So 7.95.
[Quite analytical in his own way]

1171
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,220
So that was your best guess.

1172
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,350
There's no way one can guess
that number.

1173
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:26,100
- Let's go with Gary.
- He's smiling.

1174
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,820
I don't think it's with him.

1175
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,980
[Does Gary really have the videotape?]

1176
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,720
Soo Won.
Is it to your left or right?

1177
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,850
I. have. it.

1178
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,630
- It's really hard to read him.
- We shouldn't ask him.

1179
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:41,200
He really is a robot.
We can't tell.

1180
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,500
I. have. it.
I. have. it.

1181
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,430
[Everyone is acting like robots]

1182
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,490
That's how you can tell they're old.

1183
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:49,430
That used to be the classic way
of mimicking a robot.

1184
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:53,030
Beep, beep, beep...
I have it, I have it...

1185
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:56,170
The robots these days are very natural!

1186
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:59,910
But why is Ha Ha so close to Gary?
Everyone else has some gap.

1187
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,180
Closer, closer!

1188
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,300
[Where is this videotape?]

1189
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,920
I really have no idea.

1190
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,000
Should we choose Soo Won?

1191
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,370
Then let's just choose Gary.

1192
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,170
I support Ho Joon.

1193
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,000
Please say out the name
on the count of three.

1194
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,610
You got it, don't you Gary?

1195
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,100
I really don't have it.

1196
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,020
He was very natural.
Too natural.

1197
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,010
Do you have it, Jong Hyun?

1198
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,570
No...

1199
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,110
[Awkward]

1200
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:35,290
Three, two...
[What is this awkward feeling?]

1201
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,630
- Let's go with Jong Hyun.
- One!

1202
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,640
- Let's go with Jong Hyun.
- One, two, three!

1203

Please show your hands one by one.

1205

1210
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:05,310
[Does he have the video as
Ho Joon guessed?]

1211
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,670
[Gary is empty-handed too!]

01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,650
[Has the videotape?]

1216
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:34,060
[Jang Soo Won is the culprit!]

1217
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,690
[Are you okay?
Have I surprised you?]

1218
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,560
[Everyone got tricked by
his robotic acting.]

1219
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,950
I managed to pass it down that way
at the last moment.

1220
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,060
The Cool Guys win!

1221

[Boramae Park]

1223
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,120
I have an extra map.
Do I have to give it?

1224
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,090
- He stole a map!
[He picked up a map of the Hot Guys!]

1225
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,240
I didn't steal it.
I picked it up.

1226
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,360
Don't we have to hurry up?

1227
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,710
What will happen if they attack us
all of a sudden?

1228
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,850
Shall we split?

1229
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:13,180
Gary and I will go to the right side.
You can go left.

1230
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,360
One, two, three!

1231

[What...]

01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,860
[What was that?]

1234
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:28,810
They're here!

1235

[Luring them in]

1237

They're running away.

1238
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,670
I think that was Ji Hyo.

1239
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,120
Don't go here.

1240
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,760
From the back!

1241

From the back!
Run!

1242
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,180

01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:07,140
[A critical moment for the Hot Guys]

1247
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,820
[At 5 vs 3, they're heavily disadvantaged.]

1248
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,790
Get him!

1249
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,570

[But his own name tag is
in Ho Joon's hand!]

[At this moment!]

[Jong Hyun?]

1259

- We got it first!
[Simultaneous tag ripping ensues]

1260

Hey, Kyun Sung!

1266
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:55,880
You should've helped the other guys!
Why did you run away?

1267
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,770
There's at least one person remaining
because he ran away.

1268
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:03,540
At this rate, we'll be able to
wrap up today's filming before lunch!

the team's performance]

Now we have the third class

- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

1275

But they are not very excited.

1276

Everyone, we must participate
in order to get coins.

- We know.
- Do you?

1278
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,110
We do know, but we also have
preferences when it comes to games.

[The extras at this job fair
only want to do the ones they like!]

I'm sorry, but if you're looking for a job,
you must be more enthusiastic about this!

I don't want to work today.

1283
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,510
What's your memory here, Ho Joon?

1284
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,540
It's nothing funny.

1285
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,470
When I first moved to Seoul,
I used to live around Shinlim-dong.

1286
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:04,090
I was told that Boramae Park is a
good place to exercise, so I came here.

1287

- And it was huge!
- It indeed is.

- Yes, I did.

I'm from Hongseong,
in Chungnam Province.

[The extras did their best to give
Kyun Sung the victory!]

1327

- You're just like cobras!
[Attacking with teeth!]

1357
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,360
Nice work, Kwang Soo!

1358
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,480
You're almost here, Jong Hyun!

1359
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,700
You're doing great, Jong Hyun!

[Kwang Snake moves on
after beating Jong Hyun.]

1361

You're rolling with your body,
Kwang Soo!

1362
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:57,140
Kwang Snake makes a great
sacrifice and molts!

1363
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,850
[Jong Hyun Snake passes the baton too.]

[Meanwhile, the robot kangaroo
is at full speed!]

1367

- Quickly!
- This is hard to tell!

Hey, Ho Joon!

1371
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,120
Keep it up!

1372
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,640
That was definitely a robot acting.

1373
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,430
Keep it up!

I lost by one step!

1381
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,860
You can run, Kyun Sung!

[Kyun Sung's chance of survival
has gone up.]

1383

01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,200
We did some good work.

1385
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,570
So we're going to get paid!

1386

We must get paid!

1387
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,450
We're going to get some coins!

1388
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:14,810
Kyun Sung takes ten coins.

1389
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,570
What's the total?

1390
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:23,100
The Cool Guys get five coins.

1391
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,920
You must pay us too.

1392
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,980
Only to the ones who participated.

1393
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,560
[Five coins to Jae Suk, Kwang Soo,
and Ho Joon.]

1394
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,790
Let's divide it equally.

1395
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:34,070
Don't be ridiculous.

1396
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,860
Let's just divide it!

1397
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,750
- We're on the same team!
[Trying to freeride...]

1398

What are you doing?

1399

What's going on?

1400

[This is the Extras Job Fair,
where robbery is common.]

1401
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,920
You can't do this!

to the next mission place...</i>

1403

the next mission.</i>

1405
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,140
- It must be this guy.
- Jong Kook!

1406
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,770
I remember it very well.

1407

the karaoke place in Anyang.</i>

1408

- Go find it!
[The sole survivor is lost]

1411
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,490
I'm going!

1412
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:16,210
We passed it before.

1413
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,340
- I think you can go straight.
[I don't feel good about that guy...]

1414

[It's 4 vs 1- The priority here is making
it to the destination alive.]

1417

[I'll survive until the end!]

1418
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,710

a film called "To Busan."]

1431

Mr. Ma!

1432
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:19,120
Would you please come on Running Man
and take this guy to the ground?

1433
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,720
He's too arrogant!

1434
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,190
I'm too old for that.

1435
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:26,080
Good luck!

01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,190
- Goodbye!

[Confirming right away]

1447
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,460
- Wait a minute...
- Just go! Hurry!

1448
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,800
He claims that he's like a brother
to you. Is that true?

1449
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,010
We are brothers!
Right, Gong Yoo?

1450
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,610
[Just continue going your way]

1451
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,410
How embarrassing!

1452
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:12,140
I should have said it when
we were further down the road.

1453
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,310
[Thank you for your quick confirmation, Gong Yoo!]

1454

[Meanwhile, the Cool Guys are
looking for Kyun Sung.]

1455

Is he hiding somewhere?

1456
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:26,280
[Kyun Sung is hiding.]

1457
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,640
I think he's hiding somewhere.

[Pretending to be ignoring him...]

1461
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:44,270
[Then charge!]

1462
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:49,540
[His clumsy hiding results in
a even bigger problem]

1463
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,420
[The race is over if he gets ousted here!]

I have a lot of memories here.

1471
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,040
Many of my friends used to work
at karaoke spots.

1472
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,670
- For part-time jobs?
- Yes.

1473
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,910
They really helped me
to become a singer.

1474
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,560
- They gave you free practice time?
- Yes, of course.

1475
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,370
They were all my friends,
so I went during lunchtime.

1476
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,660
My friends worked right in
front of the school.

1477
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:37,940
Shouldn't you have eaten
then paid attention in class?

1478
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,010
- When I was on a break..
[He's actually scared]

1479
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:43,620
What kind of high school student
can enjoy so much freedom?

1480
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,380
You know how we all got
lunch period?

1481
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,310
We were allowed to leave the campus
during that hour.

1482
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:50,920
- No, my school didn't allow that.
- My school did.

1483
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,060
But because he worked so hard
using his small breaks...

1484
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,950
that helped him to become
a successful singer!

1485
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:56,580
You're scared of him, aren't you?

1486
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,240
Just a thought.

01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,670
[Was it that obvious?]

1488
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:05,370
That's when I realized
I had talent in singing.

1489
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,880
The karaoke place opened
when I was in the 11th grade.

1490

What was your favorite song?

1491
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,780
I sang "She's Gone" a lot.

1492
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,080
And...

1493
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,240
- "My Sight of You" by B612.
- That's right.

1494

"The Serenade of Late Night"
by Black Hole.

1495

I used to be into rock.

1497
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,760
Since we're at a karaoke now,
and because we sing all the time...

1498

- Let's have Ho Joon sing something for us!
- Let's hear it!

1499

- He's a singer too!
[He used to be in idol group "Takion"]

1500
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:38,690
- I can do a slow song...
- Like what?

1501
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,970
He and I have a similar taste in music.

1502
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:42,230
- Something like "Emerald Castle?"
- Love songs?

1503
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:44,510
I guess I got it right!

1504

1515
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:32,790
Stop singing along!
You're ruining the song!

1516
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:35,260
- It's my favorite.
- Just be quiet.

01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,130
How about Kyun Sung sings
some cover songs?

1527
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,580
Cover songs?

1528
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,040
- Then Since Gary is here...
- Jung In!

1529
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,750
- I'll cover Jung In's part.
- Great!

1530
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,810
How can you possibly do her part?

1531
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:57,120
- Really? Jung In?
- How about "Rush?"

1532
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,560
How can a guy cover a girl's part?

1533
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,500
["Rush" by Leessang]

1534
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:14,420
[Grandmother?]

1535
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,750
This can't be Jung In!

1536
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:24,470
I'm sorry.

1537
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:28,950
The actual singer was helping you!

1538
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,820
[This shouldn't be happening...]

1539
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,580
We need to hear from Byung Jae!

1540
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,240
Sing a song!

1541
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,470
How about "Swallowtail Butterfly?"

1542
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,230
[Only because he has a mustache
like the original singer...]

1543
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:43,340
What would you like to sing?

1544
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,530
I do sing "Rush" quite often.

1545
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:48,090
Perhaps he can be Gil's part!

1546
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,820
I can do all three parts.

1547
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,790
He says he can sing all three parts.

1548
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:53,840
Give us "Rush!"

1549
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,410
You're not trying to play
a joke on me too, are you?

1550
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,880
I won't cooperate!

1551
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,400
[It'll be hard to hear Gary's rap
from now on...]

1552
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,740
It'd be so awesome
if he could actually do all three.

1553
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,420
How is that possible?

1554
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,450
[Gil's part is first]

1555
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:14,310
[His husky voice is quite similar
to that of Gil.]

1556
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,370
[Then how about Gary's part?]

1557
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,850
[Gary explodes]

1558
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,760
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

1559
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,040
What are you doing?

1560
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,220
- What did you just do?
[Quite brave in front of the original singer.]

1561
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:34,790
He claimed that he could sing
all three parts...

1562
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:36,750
[I'm sorry...]

1563
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,980
Is today the fraud special or something?

1564
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,830
What's going on?

1565
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,960
We need something good now.

1566
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,350
For a great impact, I'll try Kim Jang Hoon.

1567
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,030
Jang Hoon!

1568
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:53,500
- Please raise it higher.
[And he's raising the interval!]

1569
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,780
Is he really raising the key?

1570
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:59,170
["If You're Like Me" by Kim Jang Hoon]

1571
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,540
[Doesn't sound like it'll be a success.]

1572
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:07,110
- Similar!
[Huh? The feeling is quite similar.]

1573
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,850
- Are you sick?
- This is Jang Hoon when he's sick.

1574
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:18,040
- What kind of voice is this?
- Let him continue.

1575
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:23,170
I think he's actually ill.

1576
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:28,660
- The climax is coming.
[They'll judge by the chorus.]

1577
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,200
[Coming up soon!]

1578
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,560
- It's here!
[And now..]

1579
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,520
[Cancel]

1580
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,820
- What are you doing?
[Oddly similar, yet very weird.]

1581
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,960
- This can't be Jang Hoon.
[Apologetic mode]

1582
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,070
We know how he sounds!

1583
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,830
[At least it was refreshing...]

1584
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:59,400
This will be your last chance!
Kim Jong Kook!

1585
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,420
- Jong Kook!
- He sounded just like him on TV.

1586
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:04,770
- Which song of his?
- "The One Man!'

1587
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:06,300
- "The One Man?'
- Which one?

1588
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,240
"Lovely."

1589
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,290
This is hard to cover.

1590
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,570
This is rather difficult.

1591
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,360
But he's daring to do it while
the original artist is right here.

1592
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,910
I guess he's that confident.

1593
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:21,410
- You want to raise my song by four keys?
- That's how I can sound similar.

1594
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,830
Seriously?
Is that even possible?

1595
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:27,710
- We'll trust you this time!
- So high!

1596
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,430
["Lovely" by Kim Jong Kook]

1597
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:37,350
[Is there a mosquito flying around?]

1598
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,840
[This must be how you felt, Gary...]

1599
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,890
I think it's similar!

1600
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,690
No he's not!
He sounds like Ji Sang Yeol!

1601
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,400
[Even he's laughing]

1602
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,500
Definitely Ji Sang Yeol...

1603
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,720
[I shall be patient for now...]

1604
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,510
[Checking the mood]

1605
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,670
Don't worry about him!
Keep going!

1606
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:56,760
[Then I'll be a mosquito!]

1607
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,670
Jong Kook's face is getting rigid.

1608
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:01,380
[Along with Kyun Sung's
embarrassing singing...]

1609
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:05,480
[He is concerned by the
old fashion style portrayed on the TV.]

1610
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,270
- Look at the bobbed-hair!
[I'm not really laughing...]

1611
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:15,850
[Mosquito voice explosion!]

1612
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:17,740
[Hmph...]

1613
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,770
I'm sorry...

1614
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,170
- Are you kidding me?
[Apologizing after singing...]

1615
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:26,970
I do think he's making fun of us.

1616
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:29,060
I think he started with Jung In.

1617
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,980
[Then I'm going to join too!]

1618
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,170
Don't do it.

1619
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,320
He's good, but not similar.

1620
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:40,060
- Now we can start our mission.
[This was just the warm-up!]

1621
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,980
Well done, everyone!

1622
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:46,320
- We had fun thanks to you!
[The real mission begins now!]

1623
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,220
<i>Kyun Sung is the sole survivor
among the Hot Guys.</i>

1624
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:54,450
<i>He'll compete against Jong Hyun
for a single round.</i>

1625
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:56,390
The rule is too simple.

1626
01:27:56,390 --> 01:28:00,780
<i>They'll press a random song number and
whoever gets the longer song title wins!</i>

1627
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,700
So this is just about luck.

1628
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,680
There used to be this song titled "I'd Vaguely
Remember About Old Times Beyond the Window."

1629
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,750
"The Woman Who Can't Break Up,
the Guy Who Can't Leave."

1630
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:15,060
- This is just completely about luck!
[Any song with the longer title will do!]

1631
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:20,760
- This is the end!
[If Kyun Sung loses, he won't have time to run!]

1632
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:24,860
[Kyun Sung enters a number]

1633
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,210
3575?
3579.

1634
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,300
[Didn't know]

1635
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,740
[Despondent]

1636
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:37,700
Now, Jong Hyun!

1637
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,410
Challenge accepted!

1638
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,850

1640
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,130
[Please be short...]

1641
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:50,320
[What is 13274?]

1642
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,800
[A Pretty Woman]

[The Cool Guys win!]

1644
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,300
Do you know this song?

1645
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,950
[Yoo Hyuk the Extra's
impromptu celebration.]

1646
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,400
- Do you know this song?
["A Pretty Woman" by Seol Woon Do]

1647
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:18,510
[Huh?]
[Something's off...]

1648
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:20,580
Are you sure that's the right song?

1649
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,990
[You don't know it!]
[Quit it!]

1650
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:28,050
You've caught me.

1651
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,390
You didn't have any confidence
in your singing.

1652
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:33,460
Ten coins for the Cool Guys!

1653
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,340
Quite a lot!

1654
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,580
- It's hard to get coins as extras!
[Kyun Sung gets five.]

1655
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,960
He should have won.

1656
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,190
The next destination is...

1657
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:45,480
There's no point to it now.
The game is over.

1658
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,500
- Try to survive.
- Okay.

1659
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,240
We're going to camp out right here.

1660
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,410
You guys can leave ten seconds early.

1661
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:53,310
The next destination is
Ji Hyo's toilet at Gimpo Airport.

1662
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,660
What the heck is that?

1663
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,930
Start!

1664
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,560

[Nervous]

1666
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,810
- Don't loiter around!
- Let's take a walk.

1667
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,140
[The Cool Guys are camping out]

1668
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:07,330
- I guess there's no way out, Kyun Sung.
- You've done enough.

1669
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:10,970
Why aren't you leaving?
Scary.

1670
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:14,050
[If Kyun Sung makes to the next destination,
the mission resumes.]

1671
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,430
We'll give you three seconds.

1672
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:16,710
Three...

1673
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:18,540
Two...

1674
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,320
One!

1675
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,880
Wait...

1676
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,410
Get him!

1677
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,590
[Breaking out at full speed!]

1678
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,220
They won't be able to catch him.

1679
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,930
They really can't catch him.

1680
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:33,880
They won't be able to catch him.

1681
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:36,900

[How about Kyun Sung?]

1688
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,350

01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,090
So fast!

01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,170
[And this is how today's race ended.]

1698
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,160
Why are you so fast?

1699
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:47,160
As Ha Ha ripped the last name tag,
the final victory is to the Cool Guys!

1700
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,370
I'm envious!

1701
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:53,070
I didn't like our name to begin with.

1702
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,690
- It was rather old-fashioned.
- What is "Hot Guys" anyway?

1703
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:59,390
We'll exchange your coins for gifts.

1704
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,410
Five coins can be exchanged
to coffee gift card.

1705
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:03,590
How many do you have?

1706
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:04,660
I have four...

1707
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,130
If you don't drink coffee, donate!

1708
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:09,610
- Please give me!
- I played an important role!

1709
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:12,650
[The serial robberies have made
the real ownership vague.]

1710
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:15,460
- You have three?
- I don't want to give it to you.

1711
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:20,720
- I have four!
- Just give me one!

1712
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,900
[You can just go out for
coffee together!]

1713
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,920
The victors, please come forward.

1714
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,710
You have 40 coins, correct?

1715
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,460
We'll give you gift certificates
for a department store.

1716
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:35,720
- Good job!
- I'm envious!

1717
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,700
Well done, cool guys!

1718
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,360
[Many thanks to our five guests
for their wonderful performance!]

1719
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,360

1720
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,380
We'll start the wedding now.

1721
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:49,420
[Jesse, Kim Yoo Ri, Seo Yeh Ji,
Cho Ah, Jang Do Yeon...]

1722
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,670
I don't want to get married to this guy.

1723
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,640
- The name tag...
[Someone objects to this wedding!]

1724
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,500
makes a man.

1725
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:59,960
[A horrendous event
that happened at a sacred place...]

1726
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,420
Just a moment, please...

1727
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,550
We don't have it?

1728
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,310
[Provocation of dangerous brides!]

1729
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:08,350
[The dream wedding must be accomplished!]

1730
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,590
What is she doing?

1731
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,110
This is a competition.

1732
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,610
You shouldn't have come on this show!

1733
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,610
Just mind your own emcee business.

1734
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:18,790
[Dangerous Brides]
