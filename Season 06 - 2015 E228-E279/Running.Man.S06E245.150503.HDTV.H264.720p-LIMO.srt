It's been a while since I've seen
a guest with so much hair gel.

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,800

- He said Sean isn't funny.
- YG says that in the office.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,650
YG is not funny, either.

- Is he?

44
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,090
- Yes, he is.
[They're complimenting YG.]

What do you mean old-school?

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,520
You weren't popular at all back then!

right after the event was done.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,220
It wasn't even in an envelope.

66

- Not in an envelope?
- From his wallet?

67

173
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,390
Really?
Who is it?

174
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,170
Really?
Let's go.

175
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,290
It's a huge testimony.

176
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,450
- Min Suk, where did you go?
- Min Suk, what floor is it?

177
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,870
- Min Suk, maybe it isn't your friend!
- First floor.

178
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,720
Hello!

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,890
- Here?
- Where is it?

180
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,450
- Is he here?
- Where is he?

181
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,490
- Hello, teacher!
- Hello, children!

182
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,190
You're very good at greeting people.

183
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,690
- Hi! They're so cute.
- Min Suk, where is he?

184
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,290
- Hi.
- Him?

185
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,800
- Hi guys!
- Jae Wook?

186
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,300
Sing for us!

187
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,040
The weird thing about Jae Wook
is that he seems slightly nervous.

188
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
Jae Wook, did you sing it
by any chance?

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,950
<i>- Twinkle twinkle little star.
- Can you sing it?</i>

190
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,670
Ready, start.

191
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>- Twinkle twinkle little star...
- It's not him.</i>

192
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,170
- I don't think it's Jae Wook.
- It's not him.

193
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,390
Jae Wook, you didn't sing it, right?

194
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,930
<i>- Hunter goes bang, bang...
- Whose voice is this?</i>

195
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,970
It's her!
It's you, right?

196
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,490
You recorded this, right?

197
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,750
Sing it.

198
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,870
[It gets more and more confusing.]
- They're all similar.

199
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,240
I think he's here somewhere.

200
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,590
You sang it, right?

201
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,340
You sang it?

202
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,490
<i>In a little pond, there's a tadpole...</i>

203
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,690
No, it's not him.

204
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,380
Sorry, you try.

205
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,650
<i>In a little pond...</i>

206
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,990
Try it again.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,550
<i>In a little pond, there's a tadpole
wiggle wiggle wiggles around.</i>

208
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,490
- It's not him.
- You're so cute.

209
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,320
Sing for me once, please.

210
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
<i>In a little pond...</i>

211
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,650
[Comparing his voice to
the recorded voice.]

212
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,490
[Could it be... you?]

213
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,370
- What's your name?
- Oh Seung Hun.

214
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,150
- Seung Hun, is this you?
- Yes.

215
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,320
Making a face like an old man.

216
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,350
- Is this really you?
- Yes.

217
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,150
- Ready, go.
[Dream's father double checks.]

218
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,090
Gary, he's here!

219
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,690
At this part, he sings it like this.

220
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,250
Listen carefully.

221
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,320
It sounds the same.

222
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,570
- It's him!
- It sounds the same.

223
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,670
We found him!
It's you, right?

224
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,050
We'll win with Seung Hun!
Bye!

225
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,920
- Hello!
- Hello!

226
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,490
Brother Jong Kook!

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,750
I like you out of all the
boys in the whole world!

228
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,660
- Thank you, really?
- Yes.

229
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,500
- Is this one of your friends?
- Who do you think it is?

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,290
Who does this sound like?

231
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,890
Her?

232
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,670
It's me.

233
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,910
- It's you?
- Sing it for me.

234
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,280
Do you know what her name is?

235
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,050
<i>Chicks go chirp chirp.</i>

236
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,290
<i>Cows go...</i>

237
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,890
- moo moo.
- It sounds like her!

238
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,990
- Is this you?

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,090
- Yes!
- Really?

240
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,660
[Success at finding Shin Ye Ju.]

241
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,990
I think she told the truth
because she likes you.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is it really you?

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,270
Let's go!

244
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,020
[Now it's time to do the real mission!]

245
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,350
Let's be quiet, everyone!

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,690
Sing 'twinkle twinkle' for me.

247
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,570
- Twinkle twinkle...
- Do it properly!

248
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,800
- One, two, three, four!
- Twinkle twinkle...

249
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,990
Why are you singing like that?
Did you record it?

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
He's not singing with his real voice.

251
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,070
Did Jun Ho sing it?

252
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,690
- He's not singing with his real voice.
- He's using a fake voice.

253
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,590
- Do it, do it.
- Sing it.

254
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,620
- Sing it.
- Twinkle twinkle...

255
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,070
- Look at him.
- See?

256
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,750
- It's not his real voice?
- No!

257
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,570
- What his name?
- Kim Hyun Woong.

258
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,320
- Hyun Woong, is it you?
- No.

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,350
It's Hyun Woong!
It's him for sure!

260
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,780
- We found him!
- It's Hyun Woong!

261
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,490
- It's okay.
- We're on the same team!

262
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,990
- He did leave the class before.
- Then it's him!

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,590
- Hyun Woong, let's go!
- We'll be back with Hyun Woong!

264
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,890
[The mission with the
three students starts.]

265
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,120
Let's get in.

266
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,200
We arrived first.

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,850
[Shin Ye Ju, age 8.]

268
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,200
[Blue Team arrives.]

269
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,650
You don't have to change
your voice anymore.

270
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,890
You already found her?

271
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,320
[Kim Hyun Woong, age 8.]

272
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,080
How did you find him?

273
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,500
He kept changing his voice.

274
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,080
He's still using a fake voice.

275
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,550
Everyone was singing
normally, except for him.

276
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,520
Hyun Woong is very shy.

277
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,970
Introduce yourself.

278
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,770
- Hyun Woong, introduce yourself.
- Start!

279
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,670
Hello.

280
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,390
- Use your real voice.
- They've arrived.

281
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,520
Hi!

282
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,740
[Oh Seung Hun, age 8.]

283
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,490
- Please introduce yourself.
- He's emotionless.

284
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,390
<i>The first mission is
'I see the children's mind.'</i>

285
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,100
<i>The kids will take turns
giving questions.</i>

286
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,720
<i>The kids will watch and
listen to a song and repeat it.</i>

287
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,170
<i>Your job is to guess the song.</i>

288
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,650
<i>You need to guess three songs
correctly.</i>

289
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,090
<i>The first one to get three
answers will get the best hint.</i>

290
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,590
<i>The songs that the kids will sing to...</i>

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,020
<i>are 90's hits.</i>

292
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,270
It sounds difficult.

293
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,990
We have to guess them?

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,400
- The kids will look at the videos?
- That's right.

295
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,190
Ye Ju's good at singing.
Her dream is to become a singer.

296
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,370
Go, Seung Hun, go!

[Emotionless Seung Hun.]

299
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,670
Seung Hun is quiet
and expressionless.

300
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,460
He's young and shy.
That's why.

301
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,900
[Will they be able to
understand the children?]

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,900
Good luck!

303

[Quiet]
- Seung Hun!

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,650
- Try it.
- It's okay, just do it.

310
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,230
- I can't do it.
- No, it's okay!

311
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,890
We can get it right.

312
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,850
Answer!
Just come, just come!

313
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,120

[Is this the dance moves
from Turbo's twist king?]

315
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,380
Such an old reaction!

316

Just do whatever you see!

317
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,100
[This hand movement is...]

- S.E.S!
- No, no, no!

<i>I hope you believe me.</i>

320
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,390
Hurry and say the answer!

S.E.S, 'I hope you believe me.'

322

[Listening it once more...]

328

[Still emotionless.]

346
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,640
There should be a limit.

347
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Like, you can't answer for 15 seconds
after giving the wrong answer.

348
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,910
Why is your style so old-school?

You be quiet, Ye Ju.

378

It's for the second place now.

399
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,030

- South Korea!

Usually, they have events
at Central Park.

455
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,520
When we were young, we
used to go to the cinema.

456
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,390
We used to watch a movie,
then go eat black bean noodles.

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,700
But now, I think it's...

458

Do you really think it's
the amusement park?

465
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,220
Our first hint says so.

466
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,020
If it's screaming, then
it's an amusement park for sure.

467
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,210
Screaming and laughter?

Ji Hyo?

520
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
[That's too much of a ladies first...]

521
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,920
Gary or Ha Ha should go!

522
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,450
Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

523
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,970
- You're too harsh!
- She's lucky, that's why.

524
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,690
You didn't even hesitate!

525
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,370
We're trying to overpower
them on our first try.

526
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,800
The first set, Blank-Jisean.

527
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>Only we can see this.</i>

528
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,720
I think Gary's trying to peek!

529
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,090
<i>You've seen the number, right?</i>

530
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,170
- I will throw it.
- Oh, you're throwing it?

531
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,790
It's better for them to throw it.

532
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,100
- Three!
- Three's not bad.

533
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,950
- A small number can be good.
- Five!

534
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,490
- It's one!
- That's good.

535
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Please get six.

536
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,800
Three's a good number.

537
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,720
I hope Sean gets hit on the first try.

538
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,390
For everyone's laughter?

539
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,790
[The cream pie is ready.]

540
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,400
<i>We will start.
Ready set...</i>

541
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,850
[Face Off, round one start.]

542
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,250
I doubt the penalty number is one.

543
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,190
[Sean survives his first turn.]

544
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,970
[Followed by Big Nose's turn.]

545
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,750
Ji Suk Jin!
Ji Suk Jin!

546
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,670
<i>- Are you going to keep the glasses?
- You should take them off.</i>

547
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,900
- He has no lenses.
- I don't have any.

548
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,820
But I still want to see.

549
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,790
I'm too ugly to take them off.

550
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,170
He's the ugliest one on our team.
He's third place.

551
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,530
Don't lie!
You are...

552
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,770
It's Suk Jin.
We didn't say that out loud.

553
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,790
He's third place.

554
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,150
Third place in our team.

555
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,290
Let's go.

556
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,390
One...

557
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,210
It's okay, just spin it.

558
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,290
- You're still okay.
- You're fine!

559
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,550
It won't knock out his teeth, right?

560
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,090
Three.

561
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,520
My heart's racing.

562
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,690
Don't say stuff like that!

563
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,750
What if his teeth actually fall out?

564
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,100
Then, we would be doing
the next game on TV.

565
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,350
I think it's definitely under ten.

566
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,420
If I just get this
one, would it be four?

567
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,800
It could be.

568
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,100
Be ready, just in case.

569
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,990
[Big Nose is safe.]

570
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,250
Wow, this is really nerve racking.

571
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,320
- Ji Hyo.
- This is really scary.

572
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,890
I think Ji Hyo will survive.

573
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,390
- She'll pass.
- She's lucky.

574
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,390
<i>Let's count from number five.</i>

575
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,290
Five, six, and seven.

576
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,290
- Five.
- Blank Ji, spin it.

577
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,070
Five.

578
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,090
Why am I nervous?

579
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,540
Spin it.

580
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,390
I'll be surprised if she can avoid it.

581
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,890
- I don't think it's you, Ji Hyo.
- Six!

582
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,290
Spin it, Ji Hyo!
It won't be you!

583
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,090
It won't be you!

584
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,020
[The penalty number is six]

585
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,620
[Shocked]

586
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,800
[The Goddess of fortune
couldn't avoid it.]

587
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,120
[Big Nose beat the Goddess of fortune!]

588
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,470
[Blank Ji is ousted early!]

589
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,120
Are you okay?

590
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,450
- You were lucky!
- Fortune smiles on me!

591
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,170
First romantic moment in
a long time?

592
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,490
Blow your nose.

593
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,050
Blow your nose, too!

594
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,630
He doesn't miss his chance.

595
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,200
When did you come near Ji Hyo?

596
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,820
I've prepared wet wipes for you.

597
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,570
[The first runner Blank Ji drops out.]

598
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,100
[The first penalty number is six.]

599
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,640
One person is dropped,
who will play this time?

600
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,020
Song Ji Hyo again.

601
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,400
[Seriously, these men...]

602
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,220
I'll enter it.

603
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,170
[Pink Team's second runner is Gary.]

604
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,020
It's Gae-Jisean, this time.

605
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,290
It was Blank-Jisean before.

606
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,120
[The first letter of my name
always sounds like a dog.]

607
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,390
With Gae-Jisean...

608
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,870
[The number is decided.]

609
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,670
It's good to pick a small number.

610
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,700
<i>The number is picked.</i>

611
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,890
One, one!

612
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,220
[Oh no, Big-nose rolls a five.]

613
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,090
Small numbers are better.

614
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,990
[Sean rolls a one again.]

615
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,370
He's cheering in old fashioned way.

616
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,150
[It's similar to Hiddink's
famous 'upper cut' ceremony.]

617
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,550
[It's feels like we'll
make it to semi-finals.]

618
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,420
[Gary quickly rolls a one.]

619
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,100
It's going to be me.

620
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,720
If I can survive here,
I have great luck.

621
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,570
Five, one, one means...

622
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,870
I hope it's one.
As soon as he turns...

623
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,620
Why are you so mean to me, friend?

624
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,790
You know how it is now.

625
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,370
I don't want to worry too much.
It won't be one.

626
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,530
1 is fine.

627
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,870
[Sean's first turn, safe.]

628
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,400
<i>Please count from two.</i>

629
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,590
- Relax.
- Don't worry.

630
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,000
Two!

631
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,590
[Gary passes his first turn safely.]

632
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,690
I'll spin it without stopping.

633
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,390
Three, four..

634
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,850
five, six, seven!

635
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,800
- You should have opened your eyes.
- It hurts if the cream gets in.

636
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,050
[Big-nose puts eye health
over his image.]

637
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,790
- Eight, eight.
- Eight, lucky!

638
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,590
It feels weird.

639
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,950
Your number is eight.

640
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,370
Shoot it!

641
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,520
Your face is white.

642
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,520
[Sean passes his second turn safely.]

643
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,500
What's with 'shoot it'?

644
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,570
They used to say it for
lottery tickets.

645
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,490
What's wrong with that?

646
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,520
Get ready... and shoot it!

647
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,850
Shoot it, Gary!

648
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,800
- Nine!
- It's nine.

649
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,590
- Close your eyes!
- Just do it!

650
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
It'll hurt your eyes.

651
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,900
[It won't be Gary, will it?]

652
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,670
[Yes, it is.]

653
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,620
[Nine is the penalty number.]

654
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,970
[It sounded like a flyswatter.]

655
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,720
Why me?

656
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,250
Fortune favors me!

657
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,790
[Big-nose spins it five
times but survives.]

658
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,600
We're unlucky today!

659
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,700
Nothing works for us!

660
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,720
By the way, it sounded really nice!
It was like a drum!

661
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,620
[Face Off, second round.]

662
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,450
[Even the last runner Ha Ha dropped
out early during the third round.]

663
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,320
We're already done.
Only we can see the hint.

664
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,200
- We should have less numbers.
[Blue Team vs. Green Team]

665
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,250
15?
There are up to 20.

666
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,290
[They pick the number.]

667
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,490
There's a lot of whipped cream.
So, it comes a bit slow.

668
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,400
Just wait and feel it yourself.

669
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,700
Jong Kook doesn't like whipped cream.
Use some dung instead.

670
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,090
[It's so funny!]

671
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,380
[You must be enjoying
your life too much.]

672
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,270
- Follow me.
- Record this!

673
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,120
Gwon Yeol, record this!

674
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,290
Watch out!

675
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,650
It's not a good place to get beat up.

676
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,690
We're in a cave!

677
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,700
We want to participate in the game.

678
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,990
It's so cold.

679
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,790
Roll the die!

680
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,590
[The Face Off, fourth round]

681
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,190
What's with the knee kick?

682
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,900
[Big-nose rolls a six.]

683
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,290
We'll win!

684
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,490
Roll a one!

685
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,150
[Sean rolls a five.]

686
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,580
It's good!
It's almost the same!

687
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,690
[It's nip and tuck.]

688
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,890
Go ahead.

689
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,790
- You know it's a competition.
- Yes, I know it's a competition.

690
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,090
[Will his good luck continue?]

691
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,890
- Is it six?
- Turn it slowly.

692
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,990
One!

693
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
Two!

694
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,590
Only if I can pass this turn...

695
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,150
For some reason, I think it's three.

696
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,210
Three!

697
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,190
<i>Please, put your face forward.</i>

698
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,420
I guess I'm going to get the cream?

699
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,390
[Why else would he wants to see
his face closely all of a sudden?]

700
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,990
Not even before I start,
he tells me now.

701
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,600
- Is it fourth time?
- Yes, it's fourth time.

702
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
[Will Big-nose drop out like this?]

703
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,700
Hold it out!
Just two more spins!

704
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,040
[Five!]
- It's the last spin.

705
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,200
One more spin, and his turn is over.

706
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,920
[We survived!]

707
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,220
[Lucky-nose!]

708
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,570
Today must be your lucky day!

709
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,570
[Sean will drop out if the
number is between 7 to 11.]

710
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,090
Seven!

711
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,920
Eight!

712
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,090
Three more spins!

713
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,890
From nine to eleven?

714
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,190
Nine!

715
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,380
Nine!

716
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,690
Just two more spins!

717
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,490
Please!

718
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,380
Ten!

719
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,020
[It reaches the halfway point.]

720
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,190
You're still alive!

721
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,890
Wait!

722
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,600
What are you doing?

723
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,680
Kwang Soo, I might be the one!

724
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,300
<i>The last spin...</i>

725
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,920
[Head shot]
[The penalty number is 11.]

726
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,670
[Joy!]

727
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,920
[Disappointed!]

728
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,910
[It's stuck.]

729
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,670
[It's fun to watch it.]

730
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,050
[Jinusean or broken lotion?]

731
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,190
Aren't you a little too happy?

732
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,170
So funny!
I've never seen him like this before.

733
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,490
Oh no!

734
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,100
[The Face Off Game, fourth round]
[Sean drops out.]

735
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,900
[The penalty number of
the fourth round is 11.]

736
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,100
What's with my luck today?

737
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,320
It's incredible!

738
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
We couldn't win over him.

739
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,720
[This is the power of Lucky-nose!]

740
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,790
[His beginnings will seem humble...]

741
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,400
[the result was so prosperous.]

742
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
[He crushes the
Goddess of fortune, Ji Hyo.]

743
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,120
[He also defeats human percussion, Gary.]

744
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,450
[When Lucky-nose spins...]

745
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,550
[all goes well.]

746
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,100
[When Lucky-nose spins]

747
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,520
[they win every battle.]

748
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,100
[Lucky-nose defeats
Jinu during the fifth round.]

749
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,970
[Am I the only one left?]

750
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,540
The next runner is Kim Jong Kook!

751
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,910
I'll have to play this game any way!

752
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,100
We'll make your face greasy!

753
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,970
I'll give you some oil on your skin.

754
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,290
[Will Mr. Capable win?]

755
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,920
[or will Lucky-nose win?]

756
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,070
[Will Lucky-nose be able
to overpower Mr. Capable?]

757
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,790
[Jong Kook is safe.]

758
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Let's see if I can
defeat Mr. Capable?

759
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,170
- Four, five!
[The victory is mine!]

760
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,550
[Lucky-nose is safe.]

761
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,500
This isn't normal.
I need to buy a lottery ticket.

762
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,200
[Kkuk's second turn.]

763
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
[Jong Kook is safe again.]

764
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,870
[Mr. Capable isn't an easy opponent.]

765
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,470
[Free from all thoughts and ideas.]

766
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,190
If he passes it again, it's a miracle.

767
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,540
[After one more spin,
it's Jong Kook's turn.]

768
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,450
Nine!

769
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,200
[Goodbye, Lucky-nose!]
- His luck ended!

770
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,150
[We won!]

771
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:08,450
[A sad ending.
Mr. Capable rains on Suk Jin's parade.]

772
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,930
[Celebrating in 90's style.]

773
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,640
You're rude even at playing games?

774
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,800
What did I do?

775
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Seriously, didn't you want to
see me win all the way?

776
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,270
You rude bastard!

777
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,720
He wanted to win today.

778
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,420
He's upset.
Look how red his face turned.

779
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,190
<i>Who will come out now?</i>

780
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,530
There are two unlucky
people on that team.

781
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,420
The two unluckiest people
in the whole world.

782
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Out of the two...
It doesn't matter.

783
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,670
- You go, Jae Suk.
- Should I?

784
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,190
- I will win.
- Suk Jin doesn't seem to care.

785
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,650
I missed the opportunity
to win all the rounds.

786
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,950
[The penalty number is decided.]

787
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
One!

788
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,450
[Jong Kook rolls a six.]

789
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,350
[We'll win.]
- What if Jae Suk gets six, too?

790
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,970
We won, right?

791
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,200
Jong Kook will win
at picking the order.

792
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,130
Put lots of cream!

793
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,030
[They think they'll win.]

794
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,870
- Four!
- It's not very safe.

795
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,340
Rock, paper, scissors.

796
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,390
Rock, paper, scissors!

797
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,920
[Jong Kook can decide
who will go first.]

798
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,090
It's difficult to decide.

799
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,090
It's very confusing.

800
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,990
It'll take less than two rounds.

801
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,620
My face smells like a cake.

802
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,060
I'm smelling it for
more than 20 minutes.

803
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,070
It smells like cake.

804
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,170
You will collect flies
when you go outside.

805
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,070
It feels like my birthday.

806
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,140
Isn't it like a bakery here?

807
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,170
It's my birthday.

808
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,090
Did you decide?

809
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,250
I'll go first!

810
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,500
[He rolled a six, but
he wants to go first?]

811
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,090
He's going first?

812
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,560
Stop putting it more!

813
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,290
- Stop it!
- Okay!

814
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,070
What are you doing?
You're wasting it!

815
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,670
It's all for you.
It's not a waste.

816
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,590
How can it be a waste?

817
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:37,390
Give him plenty of it, Jae Suk.

818
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,970
[Will we be able to see Jong Kook's
face covered in whipped cream?]

819
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,220
I think it'll be you, If he doesn't
get the penalty this time.

820
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,900
One!

821
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,990
Wait, wait!

822
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,820
Two!

823
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,190
Three!

824
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,830
Oh my god!

825
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,100
Please!

826
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,350
[Three more spins and
Jong Kook's turn will be over.]

827
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:10,750
I'm almost crying.
No, I'm crying.

828
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,170
Jong Kook!
Just deal with the pain.

829
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,550
[Four]

830
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,120
- Was it five or four?
- Four.

831
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,090
Two more spins left!

832
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,390
- I'm about to cry.
- Calm down, lucky guy!

833
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,790
Five, six!

834
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,190
It's safe again!

835
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,630
Please, please.

836
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,690
[One more spin, and
Jong Kook's turn will be over.]

837
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,390
This is the last spin!

838
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,190
Relax.

839
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,390
- Please, be six.
- Please, be six.

840
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,520
[Jong Kook's destiny will be?]

841
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,020
[Jong Kook's first turn is safe.]

842
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,950
[Dazed]

843
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,850
Give us some cameras.
Let us film it.

844
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,400
We have nothing to do.

845
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,170
[We want to work, too.]

846
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,100
He went first.
How did he know?

847
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,450
- Does he see something?
- He's Mr. Capable.

848
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,790
I can't win against Jong Kook.

849
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,390
You have to spin four times.

850
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,190
If he can pass it over...

851
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,900
[The cream drips.]

852
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,520
Wait, it's been here for a while.

853
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,590
Then it'll be me.

854
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,650
Aren't you too kind?

855
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,100
It's all for you.

856
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,170
[What Jae Suk said earlier
comes back to haunt him.]

857
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,270
- Lots and lots.
- Jinu is funny.

858
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,090
Four spins, right?

859
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,480
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

860
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,090
Let's count it down.

861
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,790
Seven!

862
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,370
Three more spins!

863
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,360
Eight!
I think it's eight!

864
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,190
Eight!

865
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,790
[Two more spins and
Jae Suk's turn will be over.]

866
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,090
Are you going to keep your
eyes open?

867
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,490
Nine!
One more spin!

868
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,140
[It's almost there...]

869
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,020
[The penalty number is between 1 to 20.]
[It's getting dangerous for Jong Kook.]

870
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,270
What should I do?
I'm ruined!

871
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,990
Please, please, please, please.

872
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,690
Ten!

873
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,200
- Ruined!
- Ten!

874
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,390
- Please save me once.
- Are you talking to the whipped cream?

875
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,700
To whipped cream.
I hope it saves me.

876
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,220
[Kkuk is nervous, too.]
- Please, please!

877
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,970
Please save me once!

878
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,470
[The penalty number is 11.]

879
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,850
[He fails communicating
with the whipped cream.]

880
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,870
[Mr. Capable makes it to the finals.]

881
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,400
[Again, the 90's ceremony]

882
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,820
[The 7th round's penalty number is 10.]

883
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,430
We can only beat him
with these kinds of games.

884
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,670
[What will be the penalty
number for the last round?]

885
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:34,390
- You should have thrown like me.
- Three is okay.

886
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,250
- Throw it with more power.
- But this will make them more nervous.

887
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,570
They will have to take
turns a few times.

888
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,810
[Kwang Soo wins the
rock, paper, scissors.]

889
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,690
Do want you don't want to.

890
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,670
You're pretty unlucky.

891
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,750
- I want to go later.
- Then do it first.

892
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,370
- I'll go first.
- Your hunch is worth crap.

893
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,850
What do you mean crap?

894
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,690
Are you cheering for me or what?

895
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,690
- Let's go!
- I'll do it now!

896
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,270
<i>I'll count one, two, three.</i>

897
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,490
<i>- Three!
- The final match!</i>

898
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,090
<i>One!</i>

899
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,190
<i>- Two!
- Look at his eyes!</i>

900
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,350
[What is he doing?]

901
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,000
[Kwang Soo safely
passes his first turn.]

902
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,860
Do we need to see that again?

903
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,320
Mr. Capable!
Mr. Capable!

904
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,470
<i>- Two spins, right?
- Two spins.</i>

905
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,900
I hope it ends here.

906
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,720
Hit him this time.

907
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,200
- Four.
- It won't hit him.

908
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,970
[Will Mr. Capable be safe again?]

909
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,050
[Jong Kook safely
passes his first turn.]

910
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,050
[He survives.]

911
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,170
Kwang Soo, it's okay.
Your Eyes.

912
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,870
Six!

913
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,900
He looks like a sly fox.

914
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,800
[He starts moving his eyebrows again.]

915
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,190
<i>Seven.</i>

916
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,570
I think until eight is safe.

917
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,590
It's okay.
Until eight is safe.

918
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,320
[It's not okay.]

919
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,210
[High Five!]

920
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,270
[Hooray! We won!]

921
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,950
[The penalty number is eight.]

922
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,220
[A pure white, Lee Kwang Soo.]

923
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,950
It was a hard slap, this time.

924
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:48,020
You look like a statue of Agrippa.

925
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,400
Why does his face look like...

926
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,440
His face looks like the one...

927
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,190
- from the movie Saw.
- The one in Ju-on, the grudge.

928
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,200
He should have followed
Kwang Soo's hunch.

929
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,920
You didn't let me do
what I wanted to do.

930
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,390
I wanted to go later.

931
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:13,270
Didn't I say that I want to go later?

932
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:17,270
- Calm down.
- But he said my hunch is crap!

933
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,900
Calm down, calm down.

934
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,950
Why am I a crap?

935
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,400
I have money.

936
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,300
- Why is my hunch crap?
- I'm sorry.

937
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,900
I think you're very upset.
Why don't you go home?

938
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,150
We'll win this race and call you.

939
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,390
- I think you're too upset.
- No, I'm not.

940
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,850
Go take some rest.
You shouldn't film when you're upset.

941
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,950
No, I'm fine.
I'm okay.

942
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,220
<i>Green Team is the first winner.</i>

943
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,400
<i>You're second, and you're third.</i>

944
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,700
<i>There are three paths to R2.</i>

945
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,020
We'll follow Mr. Capable's decision.

946
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,550
Don't do that.
There's a straight path...

947
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:03,450
These two men are like
Jong Kook's servants.

948
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,100
- No, we're not servants.
- Slaves!

949
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,550
That path is too shiny.
I don't think it's the right one.

950
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,590
- That might be the worst path.
- Right? This one, too...

951
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,000
If you can't decide, let us go first.

952
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,390
[Let us play the game, too.]

953
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,490
Let's pick the dark path.

954
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:27,520
- Go straight?
- We'll go straight in the middle!

955
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,890
We'll pick the one in the middle.

956
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,300
<i>- What's second team's decision?
- Where do you want to go, Kwang Soo?</i>

957
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,400
- Let's pick the last one.
- Then let's pick the other one.

958
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,570
[Blue Team picks the shiny path.]

959
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,570
[Pink Team gets the dark path.]

960
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,450
[Go to the R2!]

961
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,990
I have no problem running!

962
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,790
Run!
Think of it as a marathon!

963
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,490
Are we going to the same spot?

964
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,790
What is this?
Is this a mission or what?

965
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,490
- Watch your head!
- We need to get to R2 first.

966
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,990
- We just need to get there first.
- That's right.

967
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,490
Where is it?

968
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,190
Are we going to run without cameras?

969
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,840
Run with your cameras!

970
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,490
- It's not the right way.
- It's a dead end.

971
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,180
I see.
It's like a maze.

972
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,320
That one's a dead end, too?
Then let's go this way.

973
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,490
Let's go that way.
It's like an underworld.

974
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,650
We can use underground passages?

975
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,990
- Where are you going?
- I can hear the Pink Team.

976
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,800
- They're coming!
- Ji Hyo has a hunch.

977
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,690
[Green Team keeps running straight.]

978
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,120
Maybe it's not here.
Should we go to the stairs?

979
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,970
- I don't think we should go down!
- Let's go down!

980
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,940
- Then we can't go on the elevator.
- This is amazing!

981
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,700
This is fascinating!

982
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,090
Be careful.
It's a bit slippery.

983
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,320
Do you think it's here, Ji Hyo?

984
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,990
- Are we going up again?
- I'll try this way, you try that way.

985
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,690
- It's here, come over here!
- Be quiet, Ji Hyo!

986
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,090
- Ji Hyo is a genius!
- It's here!

987
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,790
[Pink Team arrives at R2.]

988
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,000
- Is it here?
- You're amazing, Ji Hyo!

989
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,950
It was the right way.

990
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,090
Is this R2?

991
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,170
We just followed Ji Hyo.

992
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,890
<i>The second game is
'The Cave Water park.'</i>

993
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,990
<i>You will play jump rope now.</i>

994
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,100
<i>Three of you will stand in a row.</i>

995
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,800
<i>The two people at the
end will turn the rope.</i>

996
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,150
<i>And three of you will jump together.</i>

997
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:43,090
<i>The person in the middle will have
a glass of water on their head.</i>

998
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,270
<i>You will have to jump 15 times.</i>

999
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,830
<i>Do you see the line?</i>

1000
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:52,170
<i>You'll pass, if the water
is higher than this line.</i>

1001
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,150
- Is it down there?
- Come!

1002
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,210
We'll turn the rope?

1003
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,690
[Green Team finally arrives at R2.]

1004
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,310
It's right here.

1005
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,750
[We shouldn't have picked
the road in the middle.]

1006
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,480
[Long time no see, Peaceful Gary.]

1007
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,690
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

1008
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,970
[Water gets all over his face.]

1009
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,890
- They will fail.
[That looks cold.]

1010
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,650
Jump slowly.

1011
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,470
[Peaceful Gary turns to scowling Gary.]

1012
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,650
Nine, ten, eleven!

1013
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,200
<i>Please do it again.</i>

1014
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,550
[They can try three times,
if the water is left.]

1015
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,810
- How many jumps?
- 15 jumps.

1016
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,850
[They don't have enough water.]

1017
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:41,950
<i>Try next time.</i>

1018
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,190
[Kkuk coach's order]
- Ready!

1019
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,290
- Set...
- Wait, we'll start when...

1020
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,590
- Starve!
- Wait!

1021
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,750
- Don't say 'start'!
- I said 'starve.'

1022
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,120
Start!

1023
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,400
It's a fail.

1024
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,100
[Luckily, they still have water.]
- Wait.

1025
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,800
[They have two chances.]

1026
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,090
[Grasshopper is extremely focused.]

1027
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,570
[The three of them are
in perfect harmony.]

1028
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,590
[They jumped more than 10 times...]

1029
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,520
[All of a sudden, a hat is in the way!]

1030
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,150
[They fail at the 14th jump.]

1031
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,320
[Out of all times, why now....]

1032
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,400
[I want to blame him...]

1033
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,940
- There's no water.
- Really?

1034
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,500
[Even though they have jumped
15 times, it's a fail.]

1035
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,550
<i>Green Team, start!</i>

1036
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,800
[He bows with water.]

1037
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,890
Good riddance!

1038
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,150
Again.

1039
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,970
[Their second try]
- Ready.

1040
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:00,990
Start!

1041
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,760
Jinu is really bad at jump rope!

1042
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,900
Their teamwork is getting worse!

1043
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,090
Aren't you getting frustrated?
Why aren't you yelling?

1044
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,820
Until when are you going
to be nice to each other?

1045
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,290
[Green Team's last attempt.]

1046
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,280
One, two, three, four...

1047
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,420
[Serious look]
- five, six, seven...

1048
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,650
It's very close!

1049
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,720
[They jump in perfect harmony.]

1050
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,470
[The water stays the same.]

1051
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,470
[Three more jumps...]

1052
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,100
It's dangerous!

1053
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,970
[Will Green Team succeed again?]

1054
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,050
[Just one last jump!]

1055
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:51,470
[They succeed at jumping 15 times!]

1056
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,050
[If the water is higher than the line...]
- I think it's enough.

1057
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,620
[Green Team succeeds easily.]

1058
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,120
[The 90's stars win again.]

1059
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,830
Okay, okay!

1060
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:15,100
What do you need to practice
to be good at this?

1061
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,020
[We're surprised, too.]

1062
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,600
- See you later!
- Take your time!

1063
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,000
[Green Team needs
to escape the cave.]

1064
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,720
[The rest of them are fighting
for second place.]

1065
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,150
- Good!
- Five.

1066
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,720
[Good to be wet...]

1067
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,270
Six, seven!

1068
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:37,320
Is the water enough?

1069
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,920
[It's like taking a shower.]
- It's over.

1070
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,300
[Blue Team's attempt.]
- Start!

1071
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,150
[The water park is having a festival.]

1072
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,820
I can't see anything.

1073
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,270
<i>Start!</i>

1074
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,650
One!

1075
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,940
Why is Jae Suk wearing sunglasses?

1076
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,920
I can't see anything.

1077
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,700
- Over there!
- Here?

1078
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,590
- Oh, it's here!
- It's the end of the game!

1079
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,590
- We won!
- We're the first winners!

1080
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,090
[They have escaped.]

1081
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:24,190
Now, we'll be sure of the place.

1082
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,420
The hint we'll get
this time is important.

1083
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,770
[Green Team gets the best hint.]

1084
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,620
[Yongin City, Gyeonggi province.]

1085
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,290
Oh, it's the place.

1086
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,090
- It's where it is.
- Yes, it's the place.

1087
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,190
[The second team to escape is...]

1088
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,020
[Pink Team.]

1089
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,770
[They walk out all wet.]

1090
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,820
It's too bright!

1091
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,130
It's been a while.

1092
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,450
[Screaming and laughter]
[Dating]

1093
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,640
[Children's day]
[Yongin, Gyeonggi]

1094
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,850
[South Korea]
[Family Month]

1095
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,390
[A museum in Gyeonggi Province]
- They're acupressure mats!

1096
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,640
Oh no!

1097
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,170
- I hate it!
- Why?

1098
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,520
I want to burn all these mats!

1099
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,820
Who stole all the toys?

1100
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,490
Turn yourself in,
if one of you stole them!

1101
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,290
I won't let you escape!

1102
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:29,300
Are we going to play with
our bare feet?

1103
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,060
<i>This is the last mission
and it's simple.</i>

1104
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,150
<i>Pick a court, starting
with the first winner.</i>

1105
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,820
<i>Then play dodgeball.</i>

1106
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:43,400
<i>The team in the middle will
be attacked by both teams.</i>

1107
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,900
<i>Therefore, the team in the
middle has a disadvantage.</i>

1108
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,080
<i>Pick a court for your team.</i>

1109
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,690
The closest one.

1110
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,450
- The one with better lighting.
- We'll be here.

1111
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,050
The first team to fail
will be in third place.

1112
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,490
It'll be more fun to be in the middle.

1113
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,220
We should pick the middle?

1114
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,470
Do you think we're that stupid?

1115
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,650
Don't you want revenge?

1116
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,670
You can only attack them from here.

1117
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,220
We couldn't take revenge
for the past five years.

1118
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,350
You can directly attack
them from the middle court.

1119
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,200
I see.
Then take the middle court.

1120
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,870
- I mean, you can take...
[His attempt fails.]

1121
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,390
We don't have time to waste.

1122
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,490
Oh my god!

1123
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,190
It's been a while.

1124
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,470
What is this?

1125
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,700
This is the acupressure mat!

1126
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,830
- It hurts!
- Go to the back!

1127
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,090
You're not going to attack us, right?

1128
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,690
Think it over, you shouldn't
attack us!

1129
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,650
You betrayed me.
Today is the day!

1130
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,900
Just this once, if you...

1131
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,490
- Be...
- tray...

1132
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,670
- ers!
- Cross!

1133
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,910
You're not going to betray us.
Are you?

1134
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,890
Trust me this time!

1135
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,590
- I promised you!
[I believe in you...]

1136
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,620
It hit him!

1137
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,250
[Ha Ha is ousted.]

1138
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,620
Why did you throw it at him?

1139
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,750
You know, it was a pass.

1140
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,730
[That was a pass?]

1141
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,890
[The allied teams are about to break.]

1142
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,390
Gary, they did it on purpose!

1143
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,410
We were going to attack them,
but you're not helping.

1144
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,790
I didn't mean it.

1145
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,510
[Ha Ha is going to attack them.]

1146
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,920
We can't fight against each other!

1147
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,350
We have nothing to lose!

1148
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,780
Green Team will
be happy to see this!

1149
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,250
Wake up, Ji Hyo!

1150
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,470
You'll be ousted if we
just throw it at you!

1151
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,220
- We're really sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1152
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,090
I'm really sorry.
I'll show you.

1153
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,850
[They change their target.]

1154
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,790
[Their target is Green Team.]

1155
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,140
We have nothing to lose!

1156
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,990
Dong Hun, take this!

1157
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,010
- Hey, hey!
[Startled]

1158
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,290
Don't do that.

1159
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,800
I'll run to that side and...

1160
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,980
I can attack you right away!

1161
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,970
I'm sorry.

1162
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,750
- Just stay there!
- We should attack them!

1163
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,200
Jinu!

1164
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,830
I feel sorry for him.
I can't attack him.

1165
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,090
- Are you okay?
- Try holding it out!

1166
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,630
- Finish him!
[Oh no!]

1167
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,810
Looking at him hurts me!

1168
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,100
Don't be weak!

1169
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,790
- Suk Jin is weaker than him.
- Gary!

1170
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,390
Finish him, finish him!

1171
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,950
[He catches the ball and
suddenly becomes arrogant.]

1172
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,750
- I told you to finish him!
- Can you hit me if I walk like this?

1173
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,790
The thing you see at a theme park.

1174
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,360
It's tempting.

1175
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,420
Can you actually hit me?

1176
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:05,400
- Hit me.
- But you'll move backwards.

1177
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,320
[He goes closer to him.]
- You pay more for closer targets.

1178
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,120
[It hits the pit of his stomach.]

1179
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,470
[Suk Jin is ousted.]

1180
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,070
- You told me to hit you.
- It's precise.

1181
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,590
[Big-nose's luck is blocked
by Mr. Capable today.]

1182
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,900
[Wait and see, Mr. Capable.]

1183
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,270
You were saying
that you'll hit Gary before.

1184
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,090
I was going to trick them.

1185
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,450
- I can't fully trust you.
- Pass it to me, I'll oust them.

1186
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,820
Stay over there.

1187
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,390
Corner them.
It'll be a triangle pass.

1188
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,890
- It hurts.
- I think he's acting.

1189
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:50,250
[Hollywood action]

1190
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,890
It's so hard to attack him.

1191
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,190
[At that moment...]

1192
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,800
[I am here.]
[Let me handle this!]

1193
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,670
[I... trust you.]

1194
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,490
Quickly!

1195
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,430
[Big-nose's only target.]

1196
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,850
[It's for you, Mr. Capable!]

1197
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,270
[It hits the ground.]

1198
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,310
He can't hit him very near.

1199
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,390
[It doesn't work the way I want.]

1200
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,390
He sucks!

1201
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,520
[Pink Team continues to attack.]

1202
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,720
Run!
You can't stop!

1203
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,970
Suk Jin!

1204
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,720
[Jinu tries stealing
the ball but fails.]

1205
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,690
Help us from outside.

1206
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,530
I didn't get ousted on purpose.

1207
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,390
- Kwang Soo!
[Suk Jin passes to Kwang Soo.]

1208
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,200
What are you doing?

1209
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,050
[It's a powerful shot.]

1210
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,600
- Wait a minute!
- I was passing it to Suk Jin.

1211
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,140
- Did you really pass it to Suk Jin?
- Gary cursed at me!

1212
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,850
When did I?

1213
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,490
Gary!

1214
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,390
Gary, wait!

1215
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,970
- It's upsetting!
- It's a war now!

1216
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,590
[Kwang Soo's pass]

1217
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,350
[Ha Ha intercepted.]
- What are you doing, Suk Jin?

1218
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,660
[Ha Ha hits immediately.]

1219
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,920
[Sean is ousted.]
- This is getting bad.

1220
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,890
Jong Kook is the only one left.

1221
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:24,020
[Kwang Soo stands behind Jae Suk.]
- You shouldn't be there.

1222
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,690
I'll pass now!

1223
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,870
[Jinu attacks instead of passing.]

1224
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,320
[It touches the ground first.]

1225
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,020
Did you get hit?

1226
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,100
- I was hit.
- Didn't it hit the ground?

1227
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,950
You didn't get hit!

1228
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,220
[It's the only way to
escape from this mat.]

1229
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,770
I got really hit.

1230
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:45,990
Check the camera,
I got hit.

1231
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,420
- You weren't hit.
- I was actually hit.

1232
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,770
- It hit the ground first.
[Jae Suk fails at escaping.]

1233
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,250
[Gary is ousted.]

1234
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,250
- Hit him, oust him!
[Hit me!]

1235
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,880
It's done.

1236
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,990
What's wrong with him?

1237
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,490
- It hurts for me, too!
- Wait for me!

1238
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,690
Hurry up!

1239
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,290
Don't try catching the ball, Ji Hyo!

1240
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,320
[Kwang Soo passes it to Big-nose.]

1241
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,170
[Again, his target is Mr. Capable.]

1242
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,300
[Goodbye, Kim Jong Kook!]

1243
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,220
[Will this time be...?]

1244
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,370
[Jong Kook is ousted.]

1245
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,690
Suk Jin ousted him!

1246
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,790
Suk Jin performed a fiery shot!

1247
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,720
Jong Kook grabbed it,
but he couldn't endure it.

1248
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,650
So, he dropped it.

1249
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,920
[In Giraffe's eyes...]

1250
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,600
[Big-nose was Dodgeball King, Tonki.]

1251
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,890
Please help us.

1252
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,690
We might be able to win.

1253
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,290
- Let's win.
- You can't do that!

1254
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,970
[Kwang Soo hides behind Ji Hyo.]

1255
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,640
What are you doing?

1256
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,750
Let go!
Let go of me!

1257
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,290
Ji Hyo, you need to hide!

1258
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,390
- Kwang Soo!
- Move aside!

1259
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,470
Step on Kwang Soo's feet.

1260
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,350
[I'm sorry, Ji Hyo!]
- Wait, wait!

1261
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,590
One more time, Ji Hyo!

1262
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,800
Don't do that!

1263
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,870
[Giraffe's crisis!]

1264
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,700
Don't grab me!

1265
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,070
[He stays closer to Ji Hyo
as it gets dangerous for him.]

1266
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,090
Turn your back!

1267
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,650
Kwang Soo, you can survive!

1268
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,000
[What are you two doing?]

1269
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,370
[At that moment!]

1270
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,100
[Ji Hyo rolls away.]

1271
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,920
Ji Hyo, move!

1272
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,720
[Where are you going, Ji Hyo?]

1273
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,000
[I'm sorry, Kwang Soo!]

1274
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,000
[Kwang Soo is defenseless.]

1275
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,220
[Oh, no!]

1276
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,950
[Kwang Soo is ousted!]

1277
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,110
- Didn't it hit the ground?
- No, it hit you.

1278
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,950
- We're the winner!
- Good job!

1279
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,390
[Ji Hyo's last roll was fantastic!]

1280
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,590
My feet are really hurting.

1281
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,890
What are you doing?

1282
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,890
- What were you doing?
[Don't get hurt, Lucky-nose.]

1283
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,590
- I'm sure.
- Yongin.

1284
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,890
Ji Hyo said the greatest
gift for the children

1285
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,790
is to going to an amusement park.

1286
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,890
I thought that's possible.

1287
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:04,490
- As soon as I saw 'season pass.'
- Should we go there?

1288
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,190
Yes. It's the only place.

1289
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,790
It's here.
What was the last hint?

1290
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,990
- It was 'parade.'
- Then it is for sure.

1291
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,270
- The second hint was dating.
- Yes.

1292
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:22,090
The last one was parade.
It's clear.

1293
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,300
The destination...

1294
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,770
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1295
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,100
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1296
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:41,000
[The three teams are going
to their destination.]

1297
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,100
[Will they be able to get
to the final destination?]

1298
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:50,920
['E' amusement park in Yongin.]

1299
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:57,200
[This is the final site
of today's race.]

1300
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:03,070
[A giant robot that swallowed
all the toys is here.]

1301
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,270
[In front of the robot...]

1302
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:08,100
[A time bomb?]

1303
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,290
[At that time...]

1304
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:16,720
Look at the lighting.
It's for the filming.

1305
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,220
It's right there.
We're here.

1306
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,550
- We're here.
- We just need to find the villain.

1307
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,090
Ji Hyo, we just need to win this race.

1308
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:30,000
[Where are they heading?]

1309
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:35,220
[A car arrives.]
[Which team will it be?]

1310
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,300
It's right here.

1311
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,900
[Blue Team arrives
at the right spot.]

1312
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:47,750
[As sure as they were,
they arrive at the right place.]

1313
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,890
It's here.
We must enter here.

1314
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,960
It's the place for the tulip festival.

1315
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,990
[What will be the final mission?]

1316
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,560
- What's that?
- It's a bomb!

1317
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,700
The toys!
Give us the toys!

1318
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,640
<i>The bad toy collector
brainwashed the robot.</i>

1319
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,770
<i>And the robot swallowed
all the toys.</i>

1320
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:14,570
<i>As you can see, a bomb
is installed here.</i>

1321
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:19,470
<i>You'll see five colors inside
the bomb.</i>

1322
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:25,490
<i>You need to cut the wires in order
and there are the hints for that.</i>

1323
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:31,090
<i>Find the scrolls with hints
and deduce the order.</i>

1324
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,090
<i>If you cut the wires in order</i>

1325
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,770
<i>the timer will be stopped
and you'll be the winner.</i>

1326
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,390
<i>You have only one chance.</i>

1327
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,890
<i>Start searching,
the timer will start now.</i>

1328
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,520
- Let's try the garden.
- The time is ticking!

1329
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,820
- Let's go quickly.
- Let's check the garden first!

1330
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,990
Suk Jin!

1331
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,750
- Huh?
- Did you find one?

1332
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,850
[Jae Suk finds a scroll.]

1333
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:03,050
White one is close to red one
but far from green one.

1334
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:05,090
It's either white first and red or...

1335
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,360
- Jae Suk!
- Look at this!

1336
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,790
White one is before red one.

1337
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,320
- So, white wire first.
- Yes.

1338
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,730
Here's another one.

1339
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,970
- I found one.
- What is it?

1340
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,110
Here's another one!

1341
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,190
The first one is green.

1342
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,140
- It's very important.
- It is important!

1343
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,750
It starts with the green wire.

1344
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,570
[Green Team is one step behind!]

1345
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:36,820
[Right behind them is Pink Team.]

1346
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,520
[Both teams guessed the right place.]

1347
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,400
Are we in a hurry?

1348
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,200
Are we supposed to find
something here?

1349
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,390
<i>Hurry up!</i>

1350
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,570
<i>You're at the right place.</i>

1351
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,900
<i>The first team arrived
and time is running.</i>

1352
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,270
<i>There are wires inside the bomb.</i>

1353
01:12:56,270 --> 01:13:02,620
<i>You'll have to find scrolls
in the park to cut the wires by order.</i>

1354
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,880
<i>Hurry up and find them!</i>

1355
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,820
<i>- What do you want us to find?
- Scrolls!</i>

1356
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,470
[He doesn't know what's going on.]

1357
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,650
Scrolls?

1358
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,190
Gary, find them quickly!

1359
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,860
- I found one!
- It's here!

1360
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,950
[All the toys will be gone.]

1361
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:28,420
[Find as many hints as possible
and cut the wires in order.]

1362
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:31,450
- What should I find?
- I found one!

1363
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,770
- Scrolls?
- I found one!

1364
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,690
- Here's another one!
- Yes, that's right.

1365
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,700
Found one...

1366
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,350
Yellow one is not the last one.

1367
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,170
White one is next to yellow one.

1368
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:54,490
White one... I found one!

1369
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,790
Next to red and green...

1370
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,200
- Let's meet for a second!
- Okay, Ji Hyo!

1371
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,490
It starts with green one.
Green wire is the first one.

1372
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,990
Green...

1373
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,410
something and red.

1374
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,440
Yellow one is not the last one.

1375
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,890
Yellow wire is not the last one.

1376
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,990
Wait, what colors are there?

1377
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,390
- It starts with green.
- What colors are there?

1378
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,490
White, blue, green.
White one is the fourth.

1379
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,490
White one and red one are
close to each other.

1380
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,690
There's something in
between blue and white.

1381
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,790
- I think I know.
- What is it?

1382
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,790
I know the order.

1383
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,290
Green one first.

1384
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,220
We don't know what's
the second and third.

1385
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,490
There's yellow.

1386
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,390
In between white and blue...

1387
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,870
there's something.
I think it's yellow.

1388
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:49,590
- So the first one is white?
- No, it's green.

1389
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,690
The second one is blue.

1390
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,990
And the the third one is yellow,
then white and red.

1391
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,160
There are two colors in
between white and green.

1392
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,390
Two colors...

1393
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,790
It's in this order.

1394
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,900
Let's go!
Run!

1395
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,290
Hurry up!

1396
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,290
Let's go!
Suk Jin!

1397
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,890
Suk Jin!

1398
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,440
- Let's go!
- We need to go!

1399
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,140
Let's find one more and go!

1400
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,220
We need to go!

1401
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,690
- Let's go!
- Sean is running!

1402
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,500
- Hurry up, run!
- It's the answer!

1403
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,250
[Blue Team and Pink Team
arrive at the same time.]

1404
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,290
- In between the white and blue...
- What was the first one?

1405
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,760
It's the green wire.
Cut it.

1406
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,620
The first one is green.

1407
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,770
There's something in between...

1408
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:47,190
- Green wire, first.
- Green and yellow.

1409
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,490
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

1410
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:56,450
In between the white and blue...
It's yellow!

1411
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,890
- Yellow?
- Yellow.

1412
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:01,550
No, it's blue... wait!

1413
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:04,090
- Wait!
- We guessed it all!

1414
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:06,750
- I found another one on the way.
- Okay.

1415
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,800
- Red one and blue one are far?
- Green and yellow.

1416
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,890
[Time is running.]
- Green and then yellow.

1417
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,290
- Red!
- Red!

1418
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,690
White!

1419
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,590
- White!
- The last one!

1420
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,670
Red first!

1421
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,620
Okay, we're done!

1422
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
[Pink Team finishes cutting.]

1423
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,500
[Was that the right order?]

1424
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:40,500
[The timer didn't stop.]

1425
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,100
- It was the wrong answer?
- Ha Ha!

1426
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,720
[It's good news
for the other teams.]

1427
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,220
[The bad spirit gets stronger.]

1428
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,270
There's something between
the white one and blue one.

1429
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,790
Yellow one is the third.

1430
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,290
- Is that the one?
- This one.

1431
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,610
- And the next one is?
- This one.

1432
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:08,750
- And?
- This one.

1433
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,120
- Then this one.
- Okay!

1434
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,120
[Green - blue - yellow - white - red]

1435
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,450
[Blue Team cut the wires.]

1436
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:18,400
[Will they be able to stop
the timer this time?]

1437
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:21,090
Okay, it's the right order.

1438
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,800
[It stopped.]

1439
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:29,500
[Blue Team wins the final game!]

1440
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:35,900
[Green Team is one
step behind Blue Team.]

1441
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,970
- We did it!
- The weak team did it!

1442
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:47,000
- It's unbelievable!
- We did it in ten minutes!

1443
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,560
[The toys that the robot swallowed...]

1444
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,150
[went back to their places.]

1445

[They foiled the bad toy
collector's evil scheme]

1446
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:06,600
[and return the world
of hopes and dreams.]

1447
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,290
The fools won the race.

1448
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,250
We fools won the race!

1449
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,090
- We fools really won it!
- With this stupid hat.

1450
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:25,270
<i>You can donate 4 million Won
worth of toys.</i>

1451
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:28,650
- That's really nice!
- Poor Sean.

1452
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:31,860
- It's fine.
- Can I be in that team?

1453
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,700
- Come over here.
- You should wear this hat.

1454
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,700
[He changes his team
at the last minute.]

1455
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,800
Donate this under Sean's name.

1456
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,750
- What are you talking about?
- You're a donation angel.

1457
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,570
He's a donation angel,
I'm a delightful angel.

1458
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:52,850
Put my name, too.

1459
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:56,270
Then Sean and Suk Jin's
names will be used.

1460
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:59,320
- Really these two?
- It's weird!

1461
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:04,050
Instead of Sean and Jinu,
it'll be Sean and Suk Jin.

1462
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:06,550
