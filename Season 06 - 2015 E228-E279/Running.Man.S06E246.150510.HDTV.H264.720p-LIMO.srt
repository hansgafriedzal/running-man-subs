Did you receive the
invitations I sent you?

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,170
Are you joking?
What invitations?

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,170
Just call us from now on.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,920

Are you serious?

You don't know anything.

The world renowned detectives

These days, detectives wear
snapbacks.

19

I can't work with these

- Where are we going?
- To the next location.

133
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
I don't think Hyun Joo knows the rules.

134
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,220
- It's Gary and Hyun Joo.
- You listened to music, right?

Let's go!

138
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,350
To be honest, earlier...

139
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,220
when everyone had their
headphones on

140
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
I was looking at the members' faces.

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,870
When I was looking at their faces

142
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,100
Kwang Soo was suspicious.

143
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,670
He was scanning at a similar time.

144
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,820
Gary was also a little...

145
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,120
[Gary's random grin.]

146
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,850
I'm getting nervous.

147
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,120
[Could it really be Gary or Kwang Soo?]

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,220
We, detectives, have a few rules.

149
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,950
First, be careful of when
you are alone.

150
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,270
When you are in the car, your expression

151
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,150
your eyes, and your breathing.

152
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,250
With that, you can be
caught immediately.

153
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,020
[Ha Ha, driving next to him...]

154
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,170
Ha Ha has the face of...

155
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,920
a tired father.

156
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,550
For sure, every time
we do stuff like this

157
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,900
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook are dangerous.

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,720
Right now, Gary seems like
he doesn't know.

159
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,650
[Yawn.]

160
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,950
I also think it's Hyun Joo.

161
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,670
He has a lot of experience,
I think he could guess and play.

162
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,520
The Ring of Power!

163
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,100
There are only a few in Korea.

164
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,920
The Ring of Power.

165
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,020
[Is he the fake detective?]

166
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,420
[Gulp.]

167
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,600
It actually has taken place,
I am at a loss.

168
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,700
[You're at a loss of what?]

169
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm so embarrassed.

170
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,850
Can't you get out?
I'll film by myself.

171
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,920

[The lord of the ring,
Detective Son arrives first.]

173
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,320
[All nine detectives have arrived
at the first mission site.]

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,970
[They are listening to the rules.]

175
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,300
[What are the rules
for the first mission?]

176
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,050
[Will Ji Hyo be safe even if
she doesn't know the rules?]

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,720
[Who is the other fake detective?]

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,050
Oh, we don't take turns
but we'll do it altogether.

179
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,400
- Starting at the same time?
- We have to watch while we run.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,820
It'll be too obvious
if they do it alone.

181
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,350
That's right.

182
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>This mission is
the Random Obstacle Race.</i>

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,900
<i>The first obstacle is a hurdle race.</i>

184
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,620
<i>You can jump over this hurdle</i>

185
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,700
<i>but you can also run through it.</i>

186
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>But, the last hurdle</i>

187
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,750
<i>is made of real wood</i>

188
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,400
<i>so, make sure you jump over it.</i>

189
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,000
<i>The second obstacle is a hat on a pole.
You need to wear it and finish the race.</i>

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,570
<i>The person wearing the hat,
and finishes the race first will win.</i>

191
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,250
<i>Dear detectives
who don't know the rules</i>

192
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,850
<i>the first mission rule</i>

193
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,320
<i>will not be given to you.</i>

194
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,370
<i>You can figure it out on your own.</i>

195
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,050
<i>You can head over to
the mission location.</i>

196
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,070
Ah, this is hard.

197
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,850
[It's too difficult to figure
it out from this arrangement.]

198
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,350
- Isn't this too obvious?
[I need to find out what game it is.]

199
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,170
One of them will get caught this round.
Like Hyun Joo, for example.

200
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,820
- Just an example.
- We all start at the same time, right?

201
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,500
[Is Hyun Joo the fake detective?]

202
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,420
<i>Now, we will start the first mission.
It will be divided into three rounds.</i>

203
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,700
<i>There will be three rounds.</i>

204
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,170
<i>The first round winner gets first place.</i>

205
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,100
<i>The 2nd round winner
gets second.</i>

206
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,450
<i>The 3rd round winner
gets third place.</i>

207
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,050
<i>Suk Jin, don't look
at other people, but me.</i>

208
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,500
I was observing everyone's face.

209
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,050
But the Running man
members can guess easily.

210
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,070
It's not going to be a
normal game though!

211
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,320
Why are there hurdles?

212
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
<i>As soon as you're on the field
the game will start.</i>

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,750
<i>You can decided where each of you
will run on your own.</i>

214
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,420
Gary is warming up.
He doesn't know the rules at all.

215
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,200
- Gary usually warms up.
- Are you going to run, Gary?

216
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,420
Kwang Soo, are you sure
you know the rules?

217
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,170
Of course!
You're suspicious of me?

218
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,170
Are you sure?

219
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,600
Hyun Joo, please say something!

220
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
Hyun Joo, you're really weird.

221
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,850
He kept snooping around
when he got here.

222
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,920
He keeps reading others faces.

223
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,250
- Are you okay?
- I know everything.

224
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,620
I know everything.

225
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,470
- Why is your voice so shaky?
- Let's go!

226
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,120
[The other detective...]

227
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,720
[could it be Son Hyun Joo...?]

228
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,400
- Guess it carefully.
- They have to.

229
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,820
That's lane one, right?

230
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,250
I'm lane four.

231
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,450
[What is this game?]

232
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,270
We need to run
and look at other people.

233
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,150
Fake detectives,
you better warm up!

234
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,400
Kwang Soo, you talk a lot.

235
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I feel good today.

236
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
[Whatever this game is...]

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,870
[I need to guess the rules.]

238
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,100
[Random Obstacle Race, round one.]

239
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,600
<i>This mission</i>

240
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,100
<i>is the Random Obstacle Race.</i>

241
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,700
<i>You can jump over these hurdles</i>

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,750
<i>but you can also run through them.</i>

243
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,870
[But Ji Hyo doesn't know that.]

244
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,550
[How is she going to pass?]

245
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,000
[Jumping hurdles.]

246
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,720
[Then who else doesn't know this?]

247
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
[Hesitate.]

248
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,250
[Everyone runs differently.]

249
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,650
<i>You can jump over these</i>

250
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,500
<i>you can also run through them.</i>

251
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,120
<i>However, the last one is a real hurdle.
You can't pass through.</i>

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,800
[Last hurdle, break or jump?]

253
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
[Jump.]

254
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
[Glance.]

255
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,220
[Jump.]

256
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,270
[Did you break it or jump?]

257
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,670
[Ji Hyo hops until the end.]

258
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,250
[That must have hurt.]

259
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,520
[Two detectives aggressively passed
through the last one.]

260
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,620
[In the midst of all this]

261
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,820
[Kkuk catches the hat first.]

262
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,350
[He finishes the race in first place.]

263
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,320
[Kkuk, first round winner.]

264
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,350
[Excuse me,
round one is over.]

265
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,320
[He picks the hat like
a coconut in a tree.]

266
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,270
[Hyun Joo retrieves the hat,
Big Nose steals the hat.]

267
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,470
[KKuk secures the best hint.]

268
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,350
- Am I fourth?
- Suk Jin.

269
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,750
- Why were you crawling?
- What?

270
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,770
Who broke their last hurdles?

271
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,650
[Lane four, Jae Suk.
Lane five, Suk Jin.]

272
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,350
[Did they really not know?]
- Which lane?

273
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,150
Lane four and lane five.

274
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,750
[Are one of them the
other fake detective?]

275
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,270
Two people did it.
Are you okay, though?

276
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,200
- Who is it?
- It's not me.

277
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,720
- It was Suk Jin.
- I couldn't stop because of the inertia.

278
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,370
How did you even break it?
Who was it?

279
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,870
Why isn't your first hurdle broken?

280
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,350
[Lane one, Ji Hyo
Lane two, Kwang Soo.]

281
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,170
[Lane five, Suk Jin.
Lane nine, Gary.]

282
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,170
I wanted to go fast.

283
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,970
[They all seem suspicious.]

284
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,520
[It's so confusing.]

285
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,350
[She's observing from afar.]
- How was Hyun Joo playing?

286
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,450
- Why are you trying to crawl?
- My knees are weak.

287
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,550
If your knees are weak,
why did you only crawl once?

288
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,850
- You didn't know the rules?
- Of course I do.

289
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,200
To be honest, I thought
Seo Joon was a little suspicious.

290
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,620
He's usually really fast.

291
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,970
But he was slow today.

292
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,820
I think he followed me after looking.

293
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820
- He could have copied!
- That's true.

294
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,070
He didn't start right away,
he was running behind.

295
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,250
I think Seo Joon doesn't
know the rules.

296
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,970
Also, Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo.
I don't know about Kwang Soo

297
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,570
but Ji Hyo is slow, so
she must have seen us.

298
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,020
Jong Kook, I didn't see anything!
I'm serious!

299
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,970
- I didn't see anything!
- I only observed Suk Jin!

300
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,850
He was trying to crawl under.

301
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,020
[I should be careful...]

302
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,320
Ready, set...

303
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,850
[The rules have already
been discovered.]

304
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,950
- Start!
[Now it's just competition for speed.]

305
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,650
[Ji Hyo breaks through the hurdles
now that she knows the rules.]

306
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,520
[Everyone is only running
without suspicion.]

307
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,220
[All the hurdles are now broken]

308
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,120
[except for the final hurdle.]

309
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,070
[Jae Suk, breaks the last one again.]

310
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,800
[Seo Joon heads for the hat first.]

311
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Seo Joon figured out the rules now.

312
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,420
[Seo Joon grabs the hat with full speed.]

313
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,370
[Seo Joon, winner of round two.]

314
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,920
Seo Joon's done already?

315
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,570
<i>Park Seo Joon gets
second place!</i>

316
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,020
It's Seo Joon!
Seo Joon figured out the rules.

317
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,170
- It's Seo Joon.
- He ran really fast this time!

318
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,200
- He observed first.
- I just observed.

319
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,820
I just wanted to see how you ran.

320
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
[What is Seo Joon's true identity?]

321
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,270
How many missions are there?

322
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,320
What are you thinking about?

323
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,920
I think you're one of them for sure.

324
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,300
- You're faster than me.
- I don't think you know.

325
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,170
- I got second place in the first round.
- I have a feeling...

326
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,870
What do you mean?

327
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,650
I think it's at least one of
the guests.

328
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,020
That's not right.

329
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,470
I've watched a lot, and
even when there are guests

330
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,300
they weren't always the culprit.

331
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,200
But I'm not sure if
it's you or Hyun Joo.

332
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Gary.
I think it's Gary.

333
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,170
- I think it's Gary.
- He doesn't know either.

334
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,670
Gary doesn't know.

335
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,450
Gary jumped over one of
them, at the beginning.

336
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,320
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I saw it.

337
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,450
- He started later and jumped?
- Yes.

338
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,020
[He jumps, observes,
then passes through the hurdles?]

339
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,000
Gary and you are suspicious to me.

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,300
I don't think you know the rules.

341
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,170
- Why?
- I'm only going to look at you, now.

342
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm going to start
observing them one by one.

343
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,220
[It's getting more and
more confusing...]

344
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>Get ready for the third round.</i>

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
[Can she find the other fake detective?]

346
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,020
<i>This is the third round!</i>

347
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,370
<i>The winners will receive hints.
Don't forget that.</i>

348
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,900
Ready, set, go!

349
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,650
[At full speed.]

350
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,320
[Everyone breaks through.]

351
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,550
[This is the last chance
to receive a hint.]

352
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
[Everyone reaches their
last hurdle already.]

353
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,320
[Jae Suk, catches the hat first.]

354
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,770
[Outstanding speed.]

355
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,300
[Jae Suk, wins the third round.]

356
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,450
[It's over...?!]
- Who won?

357
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,170
- You have to try hard to get a hint.
- You're suspicious.

358
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,720
[Jae Suk is suspicious?]
- He knows the rules.

359
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,220
[Why is everyone suspicious?]
- He did what he could.

360
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
[You said there was only one more!]

361
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,950
<i>This hint is...</i>

362
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,150
[This hint is about
the fake detectives.]

363
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,500
<i>Read this in the car.</i>

364
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,070
- He's getting a hint about himself!
- Right.

365
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,420
He needs to find his partner, too.

366
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,070
The fake detective has to win
to cover up these hints.

367
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,620
That one is a lot thicker!

368
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,320
<i>- Please read it in the car.
- You can't give it to Jong Kook!</i>

369
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,850
[What is that?]
- It looks like a phone book.

370
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,750
[Stare.]

371
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,300
Let me see it.
Let me hold it once.

372
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,220
It's pretty heavy.

373
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,870
<i>You can go into your cars
and check.</i>

374
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,100
[What do I do?]

375
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,570
[Everyone's waiting in their cars.]

376
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,800
[Jae Suk, checks his hint in the car.]

377
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
<i>The person is..</i>

378
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,270
[The fake detective is shorter
than 185cm!]

379
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,600
<i>shorter than a pole measured 185 cm!</i>

380
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,550
Then it's not Kwang Soo.

381
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,970
[Seo Joon also checks
his hint in the car.]

382
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,420
[A picture of trophies?]
- Seo Joon!

383
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,000
- Did you check?
- The hint?

384
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,300
- I checked it.
- You did?

385
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,550
Is it crucial information?

386
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,850
- Is it crucial?
- No, it's more confusing.

387
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,550
- Is that so?
- Really?

388
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,350
Let's do a trade!
With the Ring of Power.

389
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,710
Let's do a trade.

390
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,450
It's tempting because
I've never won a prize.

391
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,100
There are only a few in Korea.

392
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,320
You don't want to share your hint?

393
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,570
No, of course not.

394
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,320
You've been on Running man a lot,
you've changed!

395
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,400
Be like that!

396
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,220
Hyun Joo is right, be like that!

397
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,400
We still have many movie
promotions to go to, together.

398
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,400
Why is my hint so thick?

399
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,150
What is this?

400
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,850
[A drama script?]

401
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,100
I've done a bit of drama...

402
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
What is this?

403
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,850
Is it someone who is in a drama?

404
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,650
Seo Joon...

405
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,470
[What is the meaning of this hint...?]

406
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,470
- Ji Hyo, you know?
- Yeah, I know now.

407
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,570
- You know what we're doing today?
- To be honest, I just got it.

408
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,570
Seo Joon, you got a hint right?

409
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,720
How... how is it?
Hey, what are you doing?

410
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,970
What are you doing?
I was talking.

411
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,900
I can't see your face
because you're too tall.

412
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
I'm not asking you to tell me the hint.

413
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,470
The more you do this,
the more you become suspicious.

414
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,470
This place is nice.

415
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,470
I can't hear you.

416
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,670
I should hide
Kwang Soo's car over there.

417
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,220
I should park it at the back.

418
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,500
[Jae Suk plans on hiding
Kwang Soo's car.]

419
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,670
[Kwang Soo is still talking to Seo Joon.]

420
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,150
[He succeeded at
stealing Kwang Soo's car.]

421
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,320
[Now, let's move it far away.]

422
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,350
No one knows.

423
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,020
We'll leave it here
so that no one knows.

424
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,700
And I'll go back to my car.

425
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,770
[Jae Suk is going back to his car.]
Hurry up!

426
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,400
[The operation is successful.]

427
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,050
Children who want to be detectives...

428
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:45,700
A detective must keep an eye
on the suspect when he's alone.

429
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,220
Everyone, don't forget that!

430
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,100
[Huh?]

431
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,400
[Everyone is leaving Kwang Soo alone.]

432
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,900
[No one told them to leave,
but they communicate by telepathy.]

433
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,970
[Where are you going?]

434
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,150
What's going on?

435
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,320
[Where is my car?]

436
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,600
He can't be a detective.
He can't even protect his own car.

437
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,950
- Suk Jin!
- Yes?

438
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,150
- Open the window for a second.
- Why?

439
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,300
[Giraffe is making an attempt
to steal Impala's car.]

440
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,470
What are you doing?

441
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,120
[A fight between two herbivores.]

442
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
What are you doing?

443
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,750
You want to drag me out?

444
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,950
[A drive-in theater opened up.]

445
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,850
He's dragging Suk Jin out.

446
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,500
[Satisfactory]

447
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,170
[The finals for the weakest Running Man.]
- Where is your car key?

448
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,370
Hey!

449
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,150
[Giraffe wins.]
[He succeeds at stealing Impala's car.]

450
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,850
[He's getting ready to leave.]
- Give me your car key!

451
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,850
Seriously...
Your car is right there!

452
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:51,900
[It's fortunate to have Suk Jin.]

453
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,150
[On the other hand...]

454
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,050
I became a mute earlier.

455
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,050
I couldn't say anything,
or talk to anyone.

456
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,050
I have no idea what's going on.

457
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,850
I felt so incompetent
that I couldn't figure it out.

458
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,950
I wonder what the hints were.

459
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,720
Among those who received the hints,
there might be a quick-witted detective.

460
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,170
It'll do a lot of damage because
Jong Kook received the best hint.

461
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,120
[In any case...]

462
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,720
[rescue the actress
locked up somewhere!]

I'm over here!
Please help!

464
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,270
[And the biggest hint to the rescue]

465
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,070
[lies in the fake detectives.]

466
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,070
[Who is the other fake detective?]

467
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,170
- Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!
- Yes?

468
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,750
Your car doesn't have a GPS.

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,420
I won't be able to trust you
for the rest of my life!

470
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,650
Why did you hide my car?

471
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,650
So you took my car away instead?

472
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,320
How did you get here?

473
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,320
- By Kwang Soo's car.
- Did you come together?

474
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,170
[At the auditorium...]

475

[nine individual desks
and boards are ready.]

<i>During this game,

<i>Go to the mission site

What is this for?

488
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,000
<i>During this mission,
you'll play 'Gesture Bingo.'</i>

489
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,400
<i>There are cards hidden
all over this place.</i>

490

<i>Search and bring 25 cards

<i>When you find 25 movie cards,
take off the stickers from the cards</i>

[And collects 'push-up' card.]

519
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,650
[This looks good for some reason.]

520
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
[She collects 'swimming' this time.]

521
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,600
[Lots of them are under the
exercise category.]

522
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,450
[Blank Ji thinks the more is better.]

523
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,170
[Detective Son saw Ji Hyo.]

524
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,570
- How many cards are we collecting?
- A lot!

525
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,800
How many?

526
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,670
You really don't know that?

527
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,920
[Is he pretending that he doesn't know?]

528
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
[Blank Ji runs away to an empty room.]

529
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,070
Hyun Joo!
You scared me!

530
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,700
[Detective Son's rush!]

531
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,400
You can't carry them all.

532
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,620
I'm here to help you carry them.

533
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,280
You drop them all.

534
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,150
See?
You drop them all.

535
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,700
My hand!
[He grabbed the E.T card.]

536
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,970
- I've got to go.
[Is he collecting them by the rules?]

537
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,670
[Kkuk has lots of cards, too.]

538
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,720
Perhaps this one...

539
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,950
[He threw it out?]

540
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,170
[At that moment!]

541
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,900
[Seo Joon appears!]

542
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,000
[And picks it up.]

543
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,320
[Weightlifting]
[Why did he pick it up?]

544
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,620
Where am I supposed to go?

545
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,670
Hyun Joo, you're from
the opposite side of the building.

546
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,720
Did you pick up all the cards
that were left on that side?

547
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,640
They can't take mine away here, right?

548
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,220
<i>You can't steal
other people's cards here.</i>

549
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,820
You know a rule that I don't know?

550
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,820
There was a rule about stealing?

551
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,450
- There wasn't?
[I was the only one stealing then?]

552
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,670
[I need to sort out the cards.]

553
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,350
- Let me help you.
- No, I don't need it.

554
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,750
[Go away!]

555
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
[He collected many cards
unrelated to movies.]

556
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,200
Why did you take the snake card?

557
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,570
[Does he not know the rules?]

558
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,620
There are lots of cards everywhere.

559
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,020
Are you trying to sell those?

560
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,000
What are you doing?

561
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,600
- Give me some!
[Is it better to have more?]

562
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200

563

<i>Please open the boards
on your desk.</i>

564

<i>The one at the bottom.</i>

565
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,800
[Only the real detectives
know what this board is for.]

566
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,250
[This is the bingo board.]

567
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,850
[What is this for?]

568
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,000
<i>Search and bring 25 cards
under the category of movies.</i>

569
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,370
<i>When you find 25 movie cards
take off the stickers from the cards</i>

570
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,620
<i>and put them on your bingo
board.</i>

571
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,350
<i>You'll take turns being a caller.</i>

572
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,570
<i>When you call out your card</i>

573
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,150
<i>you have to strike a pose
that's same with the sticker.</i>

574
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,650
[So, I need to put
the stickers on the board.]

575
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,850
[Huh? A golf card?]

576
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,090
- Song Ji Hyo?
- Yes?

577
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,270
- Are you playing by the rules?
- Of course.

578
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,350
[I don't think she knows.]
- Don't underestimate me.

579
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,120
[He's outright looking.]

580
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,700
Hyun Joo, why are you looking at mine?

581
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,520
- You shouldn't look.
- I didn't look.

582
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,850
- It's very important.
[He keeps looking at it.]

583
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,220
I'll be in trouble, if you look.

584

[Did Detective Son complete
his own bingo table?]

585

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,120
- It looks good!
[The first runner, Detective Big nose]

588
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
- Is this one okay?
- Yes!

589
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,220
- Let's go!
- I will go back!

590
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,800
[Big nose recreates the scene
from 'Peppermint Candy.']

591

[I don't have it.]

592
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,070
Peppermint candy!

593
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,050
Some pretend that they have it.

594
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,970
Let it go, let it go!

595
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,750
Isn't that from Drunken Master?

596
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,750
Monster!

597
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,670
[It's Ha Ha's turn.]
- What are you doing?

598
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,070
[Was there a famous scene
like this from any movies?]

599
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,200
- A frilled lizard!
(From Quiz Exploration-Mysterious World)

600
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,470
[Absurd]

601
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,900
[No one expected to see this.]

[Will Blank Ji be able to
clear their doubts away?]

607
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,570
- That's right!
- What is it?

608
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,820
- Sunflower?
- Christmas?

609

610
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,420

611
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,800

[It's Detective Son's turn.]
- I have high expectations.

616

Why is mine so thin?

634
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:53,120
Is there a hint inside?

[Detective Son checks
the hint discreetly.]

Listen to the two people's
footsteps carefully.

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,170
Is that a hint?

638
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,900
So, there are two fake detectives...

639
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,400
[Is he one of them?]

640
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,600
What's this?

641
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,870
[I checked the ID,
and there's a big gap in age.]

642
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,070
There are two fake detectives and
between the two there's a big gap in age?

643
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,900
Big age gap means
Seo Joon is one of them.

644
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,370
[Gary's hint is in shredded papers?]

645
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,120
Why is my hint so complicated?

646

Wait, isn't this a 'S'?

647
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,920
It's obviously 'S.'

648
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,620

There are too many!

Ji Hyo had no idea about the rules.

When she was sorting out the cards...

656
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,970
it was obvious that she didn't know
it was related to movie titles.

657
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,400
She collected random cards.

658
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,900
Of course, Ha Ha was strange.

659
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,170
Ha Ha said something random
on purpose.

660

I don't know what's going on!

664
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,720
Because I haven't received
any of the hints.

665
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,500

00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,470
[Gary makes an attempt.]

692
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,770
What are you doing?

693
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,700
Hello, Diririririree.
Hello?

694
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,700
They can't hear you
if you hold it like that.

695
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,350
That's right.

696
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,350
What's wrong with you?

697
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,900
- Diririririree.
[Is he one of the fake detectives?]

698
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,270
Hello?

699
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,370
- Hello?
- You need to press extension first.

700
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,400
Do I have to?

701
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,220
I was in a hurry because
you suddenly came to me.

702
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,260
Do you know what the rules are?

703
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,920
Of course I do.
I don't need to explain that to you.

704
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,170
You're either one of the detectives
who don't know the rules

705
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,200
or a real...

706
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,750
I don't want to hear 'fool'
out of your mouth.

707
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,570
[You just said it yourself.]

708
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,470
<i>To you, who doesn't know the rules</i>

709
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,950
<i>we will never tell you
what the final mission is.</i>

710
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,970
<i>There's another detective
that doesn't know the rules.</i>

711
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,260
<i>As the password for
the secret rendezvous</i>

712
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,950
<i>the other person will say
'I have a cramp.'</i>

713
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:03,120
<i>Then wet your finger and
put it on his nose.</i>

714
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,650
<i>Shout 'Sesame oil!' when you do that,
then the contact will be established.</i>

715
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,720
<i>Meet with the other
fake detective.</i>

716
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,500
<i>Together, find out the final rules
and win this race.</i>

717
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,800
Is there another mission?

718
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,520
[Where are you, my partner?]

719
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,970
Why would I walk around
like this if I knew the hint?

720
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,850
[He doesn't know the hint?
Could it be him?]

721
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:34,420
[They found the password
on the receiver.]

722
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,820
Arctic Fox, what are you doing here?

723
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,550
I have a cramp in my leg.

724
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,950
[She's trying to see if anyone
notices the word 'cramp.']

725
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,670
[Jae Suk looks a little suspicious.]

726
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,500
[Hyun Joo looks very suspicious.]

727
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,820
That Arctic Fox.

728
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,820
[Jae Suk is gone with the wind.]

729
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,020
[Hyun Joo is obsessed with the phone.]

730
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,900
[Who is my partner?]

731
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,720
- Is that you?
- Yes.

732
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,870
- Is that really you?
- Yes, it's me.

733
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,920
- Don't stand next to it.
- It's really me.

734
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,440
Don't go near the picture.

735
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,750
There's no difference
between me and the picture.

736
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,300
I got a cramp in my leg.

737
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,720
[Did you catch the signal?]
- Did you say you have a cramp?

738
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,300
[Kwang Soo responds?]

739
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,370
[He's giving her a massage.]

740
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,800
[You're not the one.]

741
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,600
I had a cramp in my leg,
and Kwang Soo gave me a massage.

742
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,750
- Did he give you a massage?
[He's tying her shoelaces.]

743
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,920
[It's not Big-nosed Brother, either.]

744
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,470
[Then could it be Park Seo Joon?]

745
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,720
I just want to call my mom.
That's all.

746
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,800
Why would you call your mom
in a department store?

747
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Wait, I got a cramp in my leg.

748
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,020
What's wrong?

749
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,200
[He's not interested.]

750
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,800
He's not my partner, either?

751
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
How come nobody is my partner?

752
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,450
[Who is the other
quick-witted Detective?]

753
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,450
The building has a fifth floor?

754
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,120
[There are two Quick-witted Detectives.
Who are they?]

755
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,550
[Startled]

756
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,150
[Look at the way
he is holding the receiver...]

757
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,720
- Kwang Soo.
- Did you just...

758
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:49,000
Wait, did you answer the phone?

759
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,500
Did you answer the phone
by any chance?

760
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,720
- Where are you coming from.
- From downstairs, but...

761
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,850
- You can use the phone.
- You looked startled.

762
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,720
- Was it connected?
- No, of course not.

763
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,470
Am I supposed to get connected?

764
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,620
[Wait a minute.]
- Use the phone.

765
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,500
Hyun Joo!

766
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,320
Why are you so puzzled?

767
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,100
What are you trying to hide so badly?

768
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,400
- What's the reason?
- Is something wrong?

769
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,270
He acted really suspicious.

770
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,750
- Did anything happen?
- He looked very confused when I came.

771
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:37,670
Don't mind me. Since when
did you start caring about me?

772
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,600
You just looked very suspicious.

773
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,470
I'm sorry but you were
too suspicious to ignore.

774
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,270
[He doesn't match with
the hint I received.]

775
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,050
[Is Son Hyun Joo the other
Quick-witted Detective?]

776
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,720
[Mr. Capable is on the same floor.]

777
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,570
[He found one of the phones.]

778
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,850
<i>Pick up the receiver with one hand</i>

779
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,820
<i>and put it on the ear
on the other side.</i>

780
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,850
[He is a normal detective
who knows the rules.]

781
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,850
Diririririree.

782
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,400
[Glance]

783
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,220
Rolled dried persimmons!

784
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,170
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

785
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,620
<i>Please use another phone.</i>

786
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,450
Diririririree.

787
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,460
Diririririree.

788
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,350
[Gary is not a Quick-witted Detective
but a foolish detective.]

789
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,570
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

790
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,850
Then, why did you pick up the phone?

791
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,700
No way!

792
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,400
[Detective Son,
will he properly make a call?]

793
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,250
<i>Hello.</i>

794
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,950
Hello!
Diririririree.

795
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,800
[He's peeking at this
embarrassing site.]

796
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,520
<i>Please give me your name.</i>

797
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,520
It's Son Hyun Joo.

798
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,000
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

799
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,200
The spicy rice cakes are red.

800
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,070
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

801
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,250
<i>Please use another phone.</i>

802
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,500
Hello?

803
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,050
[He's smiling.
What does this mean?]

804
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,850
Here's a phone away from everything.

805
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,970
I have a feeling that this is the phone.

806
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,900
I like the password.

807
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,250
I'm very sure this is it.
Watch carefully.

808
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,920
Hello.
Diririririree.

809
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,620
This is Ha Ha.

810
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,000
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

811
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,850
This time, it's the real deal.

812
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,650
Funny and Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup!

813
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,970
<i>You are successfully connected.</i>

814
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,020
<i>From now on,
I will give you the hint.</i>

815
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,100
<i>The hint is written on
the inner soles of the detectives</i>

816
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,200
<i>who don't know the rules.</i>

817
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,970
They are on the inner soles!

818
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:31,400
<i>By the way, if you flip the inner soles
of the normal detectives</i>

819
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,300
<i>you will be ousted.</i>

820
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:37,270
<i>Reporting crime!</i>

821
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,220
<i>A famous actress is kidnapped.</i>

822
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,120
[There are two quick-witted detectives]

823
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,620
[who played the race
without knowing the rules.]

824
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:54,850
[The hints are hidden within
those two detectives.]

825
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,270
<i>There are cards everywhere.</i>

826
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,920
[What kind of secrets do they have?]

827
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,950
[It turns out that the hints
were on the inner soles!]

828
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:11,750
It's awesome!
I know who those detectives are.

829
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,720
I'm going to win this race.
When did you put anything on it?

830
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,320
[Detective Ha wants
to check his own inner sole.]

831
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,770
I wore these all day long.
It doesn't even make sense.

832
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,970
It's only 0.5 mm.

833
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,250
When and how did they put anything?

834
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,140
[Do you remember?]

835
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,300
[You'll be ousted if you flip
a normal detective's inner sole.]

836
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,120
[Ha Ha is ousted by looking
at his own inner sole.]

837
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,820
Are you kidding me?
This is not right.

838
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,950
I can't follow that.
I'll win the race today.

839
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,370
No way!
It doesn't make sense.

840
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,550
No, no!
Don't come near me!

841
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,100
Don't try to drag me!

842
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,100
Let me go!
Run, Sung Yong!

843
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,520
It doesn't even make sense!

844
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,120
Why?

845
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,570
This is not right!
I just checked my own thing.

846
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,250
[Unfortunately, Detective Ha is ousted!]

847
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,870
<i>Ha Ha is ousted.</i>

848
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,520
<i>- Ha Ha is ousted.
- What?</i>

849
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,320
Why did he get ousted?

850
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,020
Ha Ha is ousted.

851
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,350
<i>- Ha Ha is ousted.
- Ha Ha is ousted?</i>

852
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,300
[Everyone is surprised to
hear that Ha Ha is ousted.]

853
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,520
- Really?
[I wonder what today's mission is.]

854
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,850
<i>Please save me!
I'm over here!</i>

855
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,250
[They suddenly joined forces.]
- If we can get a hint from here...

856
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,850
Hello.
Diririririree.

857
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,900
[He sounds very much like the original.]

858
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

859
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,550
It's burning sweet potato.

860
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,440
Don't press anything.

861
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,470
<i>You are successfully connected.</i>

862
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,200
<i>From now on,
I will give you the hint.</i>

863
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
He will give us the hint now!

864
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,710
<i>The hints are written on the inner soles</i>

865
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,550
<i>of the detectives
that don't know the rules.</i>

866
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:38,800
<i>Take out their inner sole to check
the hints and rescue the hostage.</i>

867
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,920
<i>By the way, if you flip the inner soles
of the normal detectives</i>

868
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,500
<i>you will be ousted.</i>

869
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,070
[I couldn't hear it clearly.]

870
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,400
This mission is too...

871
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,850
You can't use it again?
Try it.

872
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,770
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

873
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,770
<i>Please use another phone.</i>

874
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,570
I think I know what it is now.

875
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,470
- I'll be ousted if I see the others feet.
[Jong Kook clearly understood the hint.]

876
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,500
I know it's Ji Hyo.
What should I do?

877
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,100
She's not the type
to show her feet easily.

878
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,020
I can't find any phones.

879
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,820
[Jae Suk found a phone for the mission.]

880
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,250
[What's going on?]
[Something is wrong.]

881
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,200
[Grasshopper is holding the phone
on the wrong side.]

882
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,550
[He's going to change his hand.]
- What's wrong?

883
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,820
<i>Hello.</i>

884
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,900
- Hello.
[He's not changing.]

885
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,420
[Something interesting is going on.]

886
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,750
Hello.

887
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,700
A chain of Vienna sausages!

888
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,370
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

889
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,370
What?

890
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,550
[Jae Suk is really suspicious.]

891
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,420
I have goosebumps now.

892
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,420
Was it you?

893
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
I never thought it would be you.

894
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,400
I'm not.

895
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,420
- Why?
[You think I can believe that?]

896
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,550
Don't act like this again.
You're not supposed to do this.

897
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,620
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- I can't believe this.

898
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,820
- It was you!
- Wait, listen to me!

899
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,820
Listen before you go.

900
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,350
- You're one of them.
- I'll be honest with you.

901
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,970
Seriously.
Do whatever you want.

902
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,970
It was you.

903
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,270
I feel a shiver down my spine.

904
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,550
[Grasshopper is the
other quick-witted detective?]

905
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:07,000
Hello.
Diririririree.

906
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,870
Loach soup for low temperature.

907
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,320
<i>You are successfully connected.</i>

908
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,070
<i>From now on,
I will give you the hint.</i>

909
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:19,170
<i>The hint is written on
the inner soles of the detectives</i>

910
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,870
<i>who don't know the rules.</i>

911
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:27,100
<i>Take out their inner sole to check
the hints and rescue the hostage.</i>

912
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:32,350
<i>By the way, if you flip the inner
soles of the normal detectives</i>

913
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,950
<i>you will be ousted.</i>

914
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,320
<i>This is it.</i>

915
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,620
[If Seo Joon is the quick-witted detective,
he can check his own sole now.]

916
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,500
The inner sole...
I have to take it from them.

917
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,500
[Park Seo Joon is a normal detective.]

918
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:56,020
[During the hurdle mission...]

919
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,170
[Seo Joon broke all the fake hurdles.]

920
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,070
[And jumped high only for the last one.]

921
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,600
<i>I can't have two of the same,
and the card has to be about movies.</i>

922
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,070
[He only picked movie cards.]

923
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,700
[Seo Joon kept proving that
he's not a quick-witted detective.]

924
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:22,350
[Seo Joon knew all the rules
from the beginning.]

925
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:28,700
[What he doesn't know is
who the quick-witted detectives are.]

926
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:37,370
How can I take
the inner soles of others?

927
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,250
It's driving me nuts.

928
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,970
Should I start wrestling?

929
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,070
[Wait for me, Quick-witted Detectives!]

930
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,600
[Not that long ago, he witnessed
Jae Suk's strange behavior.]

931
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,750
<i>- Hello.
[This drew Kwang Soo's suspicion.]</i>

932
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,920
[Also Seo Joon was watching it.]

933
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:08,020
[Yoo Jae Suk, you're very suspicious.]

934
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,570
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

935
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,770
[He blocks Seo Joon
without knowing the reason.]

936
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,320
No, don't do it.

937
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,570
[Capture the Grasshopper!]

938
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,850
Kwang Soo!

939
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,700
- Suk Jin!
[People who know the hint]

940
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,320
[and the people who don't know...]

941
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,170
[chase Grasshopper together.]

942
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,920
We need to catch him.

943
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,350
He's the suspect.

944
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,250
[When Seo Joon chases a person,
he becomes the suspect.]

945
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,170
[What are you doing?]

946
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,400
[He took his shoe.]

947
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,600
[Runs with the shoe.]

948
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,250
[Give me back my shoe!]

949
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,670
The mission must be taking
off my shoe.

950
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,800
[Hyun Joo and Kwang Soo
caught Seo Joon.]

951
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,870
You want it that much?

952
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,350
[Impregnable defense.]

953
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,600
[Wait, now that I think about it...]

954
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,650
[Detective Son was suspicious, too.]

955
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,100
[Is he trying to protect his partner?]

956
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,420
[Is that why he's protecting the shoe?]

957
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,970
Can I take off your shoe?

958
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,970
Can I take it off?

959
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,650
Think carefully.

960
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,570
Show me.

961
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,750
[Embarrassed]

962
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,550
- I can take it off easily.
- Okay.

963
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:55,000
I said I can take it off easily.

964
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,600
[He took it off.]

965
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,050
[He changed his target
at the last minute.]

966
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,420
[Kwang Soo ran away
with Jae Suk's shoe.]

967
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,670
[What's in this shoe?]

968
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:16,470
[Is he really one of the
quick-witted detectives?]

969
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:20,850
[Or could it be Son Hyun Joo?]

970
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:26,620
[Are both of them normal detectives?]

971
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,550
['Out' sticker is on
Detective Son's inner sole.]

972
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,220
[Park Seo Joon is ousted.]

973
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:42,320
[The out sticker on the
inner sole means...]

974
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,400
[that Detective Son is
a normal detective.]

975
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,250
[Detective Son knew all the rules
from the beginning.]

976
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:03,770
[He acted out to lure the
quick-witted detectives.]

977
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,700
[Park Seo Joon who fell
for his acting is ousted.]

978
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,470
[What about Jae Suk?]

979
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,200
[Was he also acting?]

980
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,170
I have a cramp in my leg, Ji Hyo.

981
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,020
[What does this number mean?]

982
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,750
I have a cramp in my leg, Ji Hyo.

983
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:51,650
[Grasshopper is the other
quick-witted detective!]

984
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,100
[Quick-witted Detective Jae Suk,
he was...]

985
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:05,620
<i>You shouldn't let other detectives
know that you don't know the rules.</i>

986
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,370
<i>Carry out the mission to the end.</i>

987
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,370
<i>[Is that so?]</i>

988
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,500
[No.1 - Hurdle mission]

989
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,700
[Hesitate]

990
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,500
[He followed what other detectives did.]

991
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,870
[He broke the last hurdle.]
- Jae Suk was running here.

992
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,600
I didn't break this hurdle.
I'm serious.

993
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,950
[He got out with an excuse.]

994
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,550
[That's how he hid himself.]

995
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,270
[No.2 - Movie Bingo]

996
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,250
<i>I have no idea.</i>

997
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,870
[How many should I find?]
[What am looking for?]

998
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,170
<i>What's this about?</i>

999
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,150
<i>Which card is it?</i>

1000
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:55,000
<i>Come out and show the action,
then others can answer.</i>

1001
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:59,400
[He observed what the normal
detectives were doing.]

1002
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,270
[I know what it's about now.]

1003
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:08,500
- 'Mr. Vampire!'
[Jae Suk only called out movie titles.]

1004
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,400
[He survived at the second mission.]

1005
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,850
<i>I won't tell you about
the final mission, either.</i>

1006
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,470
I'm walking around not
knowing what it is about.

1007
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,600
I need to make a contact.

1008
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,370
[He found how Seo Joon was
holding the phone.]

1009
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,120
- There should be something.
- Why?

1010
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,350
[Seo Joon didn't show
anything more to Jae Suk.]

1011
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,220
He was looking for
something on the phone.

1012
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,920
There are phones with stickers.

1013
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,500
[He found out about the
phones for the mission.]

1014
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:49,000
[He was making a phone call
and got caught by Giraffe.]

1015
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,020
[Confidently]
- Hello.

1016
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,570
Was that you?

1017
01:03:55,570 --> 01:04:01,300
[He overcome the crisis
and escaped.]

1018
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:08,200
[On top of that]
- I have a cramp in my leg.

1019
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,470
Do you want me to give you
a massage?

1020
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,950
[He must not be my partner.]

1021
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,750
It's okay.

1022
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,900
Suk Jin is not my partner.

1023
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,600
[Then he witnessed something weird.]
- What am I supposed to do?

1024
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,600
[He was touched by the scene...]

1025
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,170
[and he casually walks to her.]

1026
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:35,220
Ji Hyo, I have a cramp in my leg.

1027
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,670
[He says the password
to Ji Hyo confidently.]

1028
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:46,370
[The Quick-witted Detectives couple
have met!]

1029
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,370
[The only thing left is...]

1030
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,920
'Sesame oil!'

1031
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,700
[They have successfully contacted.]

1032
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,480
You had no idea for the whole time.

1033
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,320
It was horrible!

1034
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,920
Where have you been?

1035
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,020
Isn't it narrowed down by now?

1036
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,700
They suspect you and me.

1037
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,550
Are you going to give us a mission?

1038
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:20,470
<i>Since you've found each other,
I'll tell you the rules.</i>

1039
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,470
<i>Somewhere in the final site</i>

1040
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,470
<i>a hostage is locked up.</i>

1041
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,870
<i>You need to get a hint to
open the door.</i>

1042
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,850
<i>There are interoffice phones
all over the final place.</i>

1043
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:35,870
<i>There's an extension
number on the phone.</i>

1044
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:42,520
<i>If you say the word or act incorrectly,
it won't be connected.</i>

1045
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,700
[Jae Suk and Blank Ji
now know the final mission.]

1046
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,170
<i>Hello.</i>

1047
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,170
Hello.
Diririririree.

1048
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,200
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

1049
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,200
A wet bun with tears!

1050
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,920
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

1051
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,120
<i>Please use another phone.</i>

1052
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,450
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

1053
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,720
Please give me some ice cream.

1054
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,820
<i>I'm sorry.
This phone will disconnect now.</i>

1055
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,820
<i>Please use another phone.</i>

1056
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,700
[When will the quick-witted detectives
be able to get a hint?]

1057
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,870
[Someone takes the risk of
walking with one shoe.]

1058
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,450
What's that?

1059
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,120
Isn't that my shoe?

1060
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,100
My shoe...
no one is picking it up for me.

1061
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,870
[It's self-service.]

1062
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,870
This is sad.

1063
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,120
You've gone through hardships.

1064
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,650
[Let's anticipate Detective Son's
remarkable actions.]

1065
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,900
Isn't that Jae Suk?

1066
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,770
I don't think so.

1067
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,920
I've been working as a
detective for 15 years.

1068
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,620
You've been acting as a detective.

1069
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,800
I think it's Song Ji Hyo

1070
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,620
or Jae Suk.

1071
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,450
- Why do you think it's not Gary?
- He's not.

1072
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,450
I'm bad at acting.

1073
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:12,020
He won last week.

1074
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,950
I think it's one of you.

1075
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,600
My instincts say so.

1076
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
[Didn't you get a hint?]

1077
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,200
[While the normal detectives
are guessing wrong]

1078
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,770
[the quick-witted detectives are
searching for the phone.]

1079
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,220
Hello.
Diririririree.

1080
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,220
<i>Please give me the password.</i>

1081
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,070
Spinach in between teeth.

1082
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:36,300
<i>You are successfully connected.</i>

1083
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,850
<i>From now on,
I will give you the hint.</i>

1084
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:44,650
<i>The hint is written on
the inner soles you're wearing.</i>

1085
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,420
[The inner soles?]

1086
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,280
[She checks her inner
soles immediately.]

1087
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,550
This is the first time
wearing these shoes.

1088
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,820
[On the right inner sole: 61]

1089
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,700
[On the left inner sole: Lounge]

1090
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,200
When did they put these on?
It's unbelievable!

1091
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,870
[That means, Jae Suk has hints
on both of his inner soles?]

1092
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,700
[I need to meet him
as soon as possible!]

1093
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,400
Ji Hyo!

1094
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,220
[Great! I found Grasshopper.]

1095
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:29,570
[He's only wearing one shoe.]
- There's a mission, right?

1096
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,570
Check the inner sole of your shoe.

1097
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,800
My hints are 61 and lounge.
It's on the inner sole.

1098
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,070
On the inner sole.

1099
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,350
Fifth floor?

1100
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,350
[On the left inner sole: Fifth floor.]

1101
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,100
- When did they put it here?
- That's what I'm saying.

1102
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,600
- They're on both sides?
- Yes.

1103
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,150
- There should be one.
- There must be a lounge.

1104
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,150
[They don't have the hint
that Kwang Soo took.]

1105
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,200
Let's go to the fifth floor.

1106
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:57,000
They took the shoe.

1107
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,800
Let's go to the fifth floor.

1108
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,570
Without a shoe...

1109
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,570
what am I doing?

1110
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,970
[Giraffe is still wandering
around on the third floor.]

1111
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,620
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1112
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,270
Come over here.

1113
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,570
I won't be nice if I have to
catch you.

1114
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:17,950
- Pardon?
- I won't be nice if I catch you.

1115
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,600
I'm serious, I warned you!

1116
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,750
If I have to catch you...

1117
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:25,500
If you catch him...

1118
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,670
I will spank him 100 times.

1119
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:32,000
I'll follow you forever.

1120
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,170
Okay!

1121
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,550
[Welcome!]

1122
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,200
- Did you see it?
- It's not Jae Suk.

1123
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,800
What do you mean?
Then you should have been ousted.

1124
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,020
Please give me back my shoe.

1125
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,250
Give me back my shoe!

1126
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,150
There's nothing in that shoe.
Give it back to me!

1127
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,770
- Give it back.
- Let me check the shoe.

1128
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,420
There's nothing!

1129
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,820
I'd rather be ousted.

1130
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:04,620
I'll check and be ousted.

1131
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,650
[Grasshopper is better
than Mr. Capable.]

1132
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,420
You saw it, right?
I think he saw it, Hyun Joo.

1133
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,400
He saw it.
That's why he's acting this way.

1134
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,270
I need to catch Jae Suk again.

1135
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,800
Let me see it.

1136
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,400
What do you want to see?

1137
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,020
[Grasshopper couldn't even
check the last hint.]

1138
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,450
I don't care if I will be ousted.
Just show me your shoes.

1139
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,450
Okay, do whatever you want.

1140
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,550
There's nothing.

1141
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,600
Look.

1142
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,470
[Mr. Capable takes both
of his shoes off.]

1143
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,470
Hurry and check.

1144
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,150
Fifth floor?

1145
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,000
94.

1146
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,570
Seriously...

1147
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,620
[Giving out two hints will be okay.]

1148
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,550
See?
I said it'll be on the fifth floor.

1149
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,700
[Mr. Capable is going
to the fifth floor.]

1150
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,470
It was the fifth floor.

1151
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,150
[Oh my, Mr. Capable is coming!]

1152
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,520
[Alert! Mr. Capable is entering
the fifth floor!]

1153
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,220
[Hello, the fifth floor!]

1154
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:22,270
[For her, it's hell not hello.]

1155
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,320
What a coincidence to meet him!

1156
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,300
[Looking at his shoes.]

1157
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,350
I'm not the one.

1158
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,220
[Fortunately, he's not
a real detective.]

1159
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,320
[Jae Suk finally has
a chance to be by himself.]

1160
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,300
I saw it.
It's 94.

1161
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,100
What's 94?

1162
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:54,320
[The critical hints are the
fifth floor, lounge, 61, and 94.]

1163
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,400
94, 94...

1164
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:03,720
What's 94 mean?

1165
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,320
How come I can't see
Song Ji Hyo around?

1166
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,870
[Finally, his intuition is right.]

1167
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,320
I haven't seen Song Ji Hyo.

1168
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,850
[Meaning she's hiding something.]

1169
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,600
[Song Ji Hyo finds something.]

1170
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,050
[It's the lounge!]

1171
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,420
[The lounge on the fifth floor is
detected under Blank Ji's radar.]

1172
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,470
[R mark is there!]

1173
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,770
[Fail]

1174
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:56,600
[Ji Hyo doesn't know the
last hint, 94.]

1175
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,470
Ji Hyo!

1176
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:02,400
[I need to let her know the last hint.]
- Miss Blank!

1177
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,520
Where did she go?

1178
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,920
If she gets caught by Jong Kook,
that's the end.

1179
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,850
[360 degrees rotation,
Kkuk's radar detection starts.]

1180
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,300
94, Where could that number
be used?

1181
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,470
[I should start moving then...]
- 94... 94...

1182
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:25,420
[Someone's coming!]

1183
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,450
[That's Detective Son
who kept guessing wrong!]

1184
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:33,770
[Song Ji Hyo, you...]

1185
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,420
What's wrong, Hyun Joo?

1186
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:41,350
- What's wrong?
[Blank Ji is in danger!]

1187
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,600
- Why are you attacking me?
- What's going on?

1188
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:50,050
[Looking at the situation...]

1189
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,070
[It's you two!]

1190
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:57,850
[He rounded up the quick-witted
detectives at the end.]

1191
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,600
Don't do this to us.

1192
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,920
Song Ji Hyo, I haven't seen you
for the past two hours.

1193
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,600
[Scuffle]

1194
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,470
- Why did she take off my name tag?
- You're ousted.

1195
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,470
[Really?]

1196
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:18,550
You're ousted.
Take your name tag and go.

1197
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,300
You'll find nothing with my shoes.

1198
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,300
There's nothing.

1199
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,120
- I have nothing, either.
[You really have nothing?]

1200
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,650
And you're ousted.

1201
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,350
- Why did you eliminate my name tag?
- I'm sorry.

1202
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:45,100
[They're indeed
quick-witted detectives.]

1203
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,420
I have 15 years of
experience as a detective.

1204
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:54,300
[Pitiable]
- I'm sorry, Hyun Joo!

1205
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,150
- The last hint was 94.
- 94?

1206
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:03,400
Song Ji Hyo, where are you hiding?

1207
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:11,000
What does 94 mean?

1208
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,650
[Detective Son keeps laughing.]

1209
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,070
[It's a speed battle now!]

1210
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,220
[Who will rescue the actress first?]

1211
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,050
[The hostage actress has been
locked up for more than two hours.]

1212
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,670
[Someone unlocked the door.]

1213
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:47,200
[Who are you?]

1214
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,350
[Quick-witted Detectives,
Jae Suk and Blank Ji.]

1215
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,170
[They have entered the lounge
on a wild dash.]

1216
01:15:55,170 --> 01:16:00,450
- 94!
[They entered the pin number safely.]

1217
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,170
[It's open!]

1218
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,520
- Who are you?
- We finally found you!

1219
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,720
That was it!
Who are you?

1220
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,420
[Mysticism]
- Excuse me, who are you?

1221
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,400
- We've gone through a lot.
- Can I see your face?

1222
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
We ran everywhere to find you.

1223
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,550
Hello!

1224
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,210
[That sounds familiar...]

1225
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:32,450
[Seo Woo]

1226
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:36,470
- Did you find her?
- Where did you come here?

1227
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:37,950
Jong Kook!

1228
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:40,620
[Detective Son comes to
see her in a hurry.]

1229
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,120
Hello, Hyun Joo!

1230
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,720
Release her.

1231
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,520
[The two detectives succeed
at rescuing the actress!]

1232
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,500
Thank you, Seo Woo.

1233
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,270
[Thank you for being locked up.]

1234
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:58,470
Hyun Joo acted like a real
veteran detective today.

1235
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,320
No, he kept guessing wrong.

1236
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,870
He seemed like a culprit.

1237
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,220
Ji Hyo and I rescued the actress.

1238
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,970
I prepared a personal gift.

1239
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:13,820
She prepared a gift?

1240
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:19,620
010...
[Her phone number again?]

1241
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:23,450
[The firecracker cracked hysterically.]
- It scared me.

1242
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:26,170
Why did you say 010?

1243
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,900
- Why were you saying that?
- This is my day!

1244
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,870
[010- thanks-everyone!]

1245
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,400
Thank you for being here, Seo Woo!

1246
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,370
Veteran detective,
Son Hyun Joo and Park Seo Joon.

1247
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:46,150
Let's give them a round of applause!
