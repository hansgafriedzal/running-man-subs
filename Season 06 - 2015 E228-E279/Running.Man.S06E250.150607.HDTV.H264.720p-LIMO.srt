00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,380
Why didn't you call me?

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,860
Why are you personally greeting them?

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,610
Nice to see you.

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,920
[It's been three years.]
Get in line.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,470
Why didn't you greet me?

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,610
It's an honor to see you!

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,520
He's gotten mean!

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,440
They would look great even if
they we wearing this costume.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,010
Ha Ha envies GD the most.

31
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,830
[Thank you.]
Who doesn't envy GD?

32
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,210
I don't envy him.
He's a great man.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,320
Be my son's godfather.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
[Embarrassed]
Make him just like you!

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,030
- He wants to make his son like GD.
- Start training from now on!

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,890
- Dae Sung, you look the same as before.
- That's right.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,350
I was getting too handsome.

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,840
I wanted to go back to my original style.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,260
Is he serious or what?

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,470
His persona is going to be changed.

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,750
What's your new persona?

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,090
Ugly man, I have to go back.

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,830
He's showing his forehead
and discouraged.

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,580
When he had those bangs,
everyone said

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,380
that he looks handsome
and rejuvenated.

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,530
I've covered up half of my face

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,380
and they said my face
is brightened up.

48
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,580
- Unbelievable.
- What is it today?

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,920
- Are we from the past?
- Back to the past?

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,670
- Where are you from, GD?
- We're from Rome.

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,090
[Why does he look so awesome?]
He's so cool!

52
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,580
What about you, T.O.P?

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,350
We're from Lome.

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,120
I had a recording with T.O.P,
and he's changed.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,320
- Like what?
- He talks in a less deep voice now.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,750
- He doesn't talk in very deep voice.
- Really?

57
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,660
As you can guess from your costume

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,150
you're big merchants from the Joseon Era

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,550
and gladiators from the Roman Era.

60
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,320
What are you?
Are all of you Hong Gil Dong?

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,090
- What did you say?
- We do look like him though.

62
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,290
Move aside!
You're covering Big Bang.

63
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,010
- What?
- Why are you wearing a skirt?

64
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,430
- Move aside!
- Don't look down on this sword.

65
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,410
This is for beating up.

66
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,780
To go back to the past that you're from

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,920
you need to win
the Time Track Race.

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,550
Let me explain
the rules for the race.

69
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,580
What you need to do to win is...

70
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,400
There's only one 'Back-To Car'

71
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,380
<i>that will let you go
back to the past.</i>

72
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,810
<i>Only the final winner can get on
the car and go back to the past.</i>

73
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,020
<i>When you complete a mission first
you will be able to choose</i>

74
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,890
<i>the gates of the final relay.</i>

75
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,670
<i>There are two missions to complete.</i>

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,380
<i>At the final race, the team who gets on
the 'Back-To Car' is the winner.</i>

77
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,180
Isn't this place familiar to you?

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,120
Yes, I know this place.
Ha Ha and I did a racing game.

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,240
Here?

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,830
- You might have an advantage.
- What advantage?

81
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,430
- How?
- He said so!

82
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,350
- Why are you doubting?
- Why is it to your advantage?

83
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,380
- Do you remember the course?
- It's in my mind.

84
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,840
- Go to the first mission site.
- Let's go!

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,950
[Was Big Bang too quiet?]

86
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,720
[They have thrown themselves!]

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,180
[Bite, run...]

88
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,490
[throw themselves and strip!]
[Total variety gift set!]

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,520
[Everything about Big Bang!]
[Let's go!]

90
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,240
[It looks like the gears are spinning.]

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,180
Oh, okay!

92
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,180
[Curious]

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,350
[Where are they?]

94
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,550
Those aren't acupressure mats, are they?

95
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,580
What is it?

96
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,430
[What is the gear set for?]

97
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,690
Is that a gear?

98
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,350
What is it?

99
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,430
[A special outdoor set
for the time travelers.]

100
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,690
[The super-sized gears in the clock.]
They're wagon wheels.

101
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,230
- What is it?
- Oh, they're gears?

102
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,660
- They're moving.
- Oh, the ones inside a watch?

103
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,920
[He's curious and nervous.]

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,660
[Different sizes, different locations]

105
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,180
[What mission will they be
given on these gears?]

106
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,780
What is this for?
Do we have to put our face in?

107
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,060
<i>The first mission is
'The Cuckoo Clock Goes Cuckoo.'</i>

108
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,150
- What's that?
- We will tell you the time.

109
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,070
Remember what time it is...

110
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,500
[Suddenly, the gears start moving!]

111
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,410
- That's really fast!
- They're fast!

112
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,230
[Each gear moves in a different speed.]

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,840
- It's so fast.
- Look at that!

114
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,520
You need to go through the gears
and get to this cuckoo clock.

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,980
Then break the plastic wrap
on the clock with your face.

116
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,350
Say 'cuckoo' as many times
as the presented time.

117
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,920
Just like a cuckoo clock.

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,260
It'll be difficult at 12 o'clock.

119
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,470
The person who succeeds at it
will leave the clock.

120
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,230
The first team to succeed
will win the first mission.

121
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,830
In short, this is an agonizing game!

122
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,240
As more members leave the set,
winning will happen, but it'll be hard.

123
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,060
[When and who leaves
can change the situation.]

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,630
I've become handsome,
my fans might leave me if I do this.

125
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,520
Don't they need to do
something like a mud fight?

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,580
I don't know it might be the costume...

127
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,950
but Dae Sung looks like he's
dressed like a foreigner for a skit.

128
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,210
Isn't he one of the foreign actors
in 'Mystic TV Surprise'?

129
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,150
Look at his hair!

130
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,810
You look like a Westerner.

131
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,980
GD was in one of the
toughest races ever.

132
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,150
At that time, GD smelled like a frog.

133
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,380
<i>We haven't played that game since.</i>

134
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,430
[No one has played the game since then...]

135
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,210
I think we can win this game.

136
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,610
On the way, Jong Kook said...

137
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,580
he will make everyone fall
in the worst case scenario.

138
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,610
I said, you pass out sometimes.
But we edit the scenes out.

139
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,470
[I'm lucky to be on his team.]

140
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,270
<i>- I'm nervous to play against Big Bang.
- Very nervous.</i>

141
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,210
I don't want to lose.

142
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,410
We'll start the first round,
ready!

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,410
[The gears start moving.]

144
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,690
- Why so fast?
- How can we go through these?

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,240
[Will they be able to
make it through the gears?]

146
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
The time is...

147
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,070
- The first person at the clock...
- Sing 'cuckoo.'

148
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,950
We can drag each other, too.

149
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,550
[Break through the plastic wrap,
and sing cuckoo!]

150
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,470
[It's 9 o'clock!]

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,040
[GD passes the first gear
with a forward roll.]

152
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,320
[Tap dancing on the gear]

153
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,610
[Wobble, wobble]

154
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,750
[Hop, hop, hop]

155
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,270
[Chaos]

156
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,720
[Despite the ruckus, Jong Kook
and T.O.P are in the lead.]

157
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,550
[Break the plastic wrap,
and sing nine times!]

158
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,270
[But why can't I break it?]

159
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,980
[The floor is still rotating.]

160
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,350
[Looks like a rice ball.]

161
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,350
[Tae Yang is spinning on the gear.]

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,430
[Tae Yang has escaped from the gear.]

163
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,520
[Now everyone arrived at the clock.]

164
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,750
[Their tops and bottoms are
in different situations.]

165
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,550
[Are you really the T.O.P we know?]

166
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,290
Go back!

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
[Jong Kook is a human barricade.]

168
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,690
[GD is sacrificing himself.]

169
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,380
One, two, three!

170
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,640
Break it!

171
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,120
[His hair is back to normal.]

172
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,980
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo

173
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,430
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

174
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,430
- Okay!
- He did it!

175
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,580
Good job!

176
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,860
Kim Jong Kook can't do that!

177
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,920
He blocks us from getting in.

178
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,260
Isn't that foul play?

179
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,030
I wanted to give up in the middle.

180
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,550
The wrap was hard to break through.

181
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,550
[The reminder of the horrible work]

182
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,810
This is an exciting game!

183
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,380
We need to get inside first because
Jong Kook is blocking for us.

184
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,350
We need to stop Jong Kook.

185
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,070
- Don't let him go there.
- Go to the clock first.

186
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,180
[T.O.P leaves the clock.]

187
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,350
I played one game,
why am I so tired?

188
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,320
- We need to keep running.
- Yes, run sideways.

189
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,980
My feet got twisted.

190
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,120
The plastic wrap is very tough!

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,070
- Let's go!
- It's important to finish first.

192
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,150
Big Bang's team has fewer members now.

193
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,380
Right, it's going to be easier for us.

194
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,750
Ready, it is...

195
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,230
[The gears start moving again.]

196
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,240
[11 o'clock!]

197
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,720
[They are faster than before.]

198
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,380
[Tae Yang and GD are in the lead.]

199
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,640
[Tae Yang runs fast...]

200
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,780
[and knocks his head!]

201
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,980
[The Pink Alien]

202
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,240
[Dae Sung is tap dancing again.]

203
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,630
[An alien is about to be born.]

204
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,920
What time is it?

205
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,470
Wait!

206
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,470
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo...

207
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,750
[Stop Tae Yang!]

208
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,180
[But Jong Kook, the barricade
doesn't move a bit.]

209
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,180
He's biting my arm!

210
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,720
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,550
12 o'clock?
No, it's not!

212
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,180
[Tae Yang, the cuckoo is wrong.]

213
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,230
Don't bite me!

214
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,410
[Bite]

215
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,980
- Keep going!
- Get in!

216
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,950
[GD comes out of the hole
Tae Yang made.]

217
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,550
What time is it?

218
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,270
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo...

219
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,550
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

220
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,870
[GD cuckoos the right amount of times!]

221
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,830
- Wow, you're the best!
- Did he make it?

222
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,550
- How many times did you say it?
- 12 times.

223
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,660
Why?

224
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,690
[After two rounds,
GD lost all of his energy.]

225
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,180
I couldn't think when my
mouth and head were covered.

226
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,830
It's hard to run and block
Jong Kook at the same time.

227
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,980
Can we not run through the gears?

228
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,290
- Please stop the gear!
- We can't block him anyway!

229
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,980
Ugh, I got bitten so much!

230
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm covered in bite marks!

231
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,920
You're lucky, Ji Yong!

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,890
He went into the hole very fast.

233
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,460
What are you doing?

234
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,120
Let's think of a plan.

235
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
This is a physical game.

236
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,580
Let's block Jong Kook
and let them go.

237
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,240
We need three people to hold him.

238
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,610
Or all of us can attack
Jong Kook's head!

239
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,150
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, and Gary
are the strongest among us.

240
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,290
Block him, and let Ji Hyo go first.

241
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,030
- We need to break through it fast.
- The three of you go.

242
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,430
I think they are
trying to make you succeed.

243
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,860
Otherwise, they can't win this.

244
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,120
One or two of you who can
work with me stay until later.

245
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,010
And the rest should get out first.

246
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,580
Even if they get there...

247
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,520
You and I should get out first.

248
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,890
- Dae Sung can stay.
- Because you're strong.

249
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,580
- Do you exercise?
- Yes, I do.

250
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,610
He's stronger now!

251
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,950
People like you and me
need to exercise.

252
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,490
That's the only way to survive.

253
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,120
We need to keep our body fit.

254
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,460
[The half-closed eyes brothers,
unite together.]

255
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,120
Tae Yang!

256
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,860
How does your hair stay moist?

257
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,150
I put some water.

258
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,120
What are you doing
in the middle of the meeting?

259
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,780
- Don't be jealous!
- Concentrate!

260
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,830
Is this a fan meeting?

261
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,720
Put some water.

262
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,380
[He puts water in immediately.]

263
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,230
It's going to dry soon.

264
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,410
- You look...
- Look at him.

265
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,810
Did you get a back shower?

266
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,010
You look like you played it really hard.

267
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,550
[Ha Ha styles his hair like Tae Yang.]

268
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,750
You two look similar...

269
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,780
from neck to toe.

270
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,950
Let's play it again.

271
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,270
If you're ready, we'll resume.

272
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,870
You're getting close to me?

273
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,410
Three of you?

274
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,780
They don't look at me
but they're standing next to me.

275
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,090
It's weird.

276
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,860
Look over here.

277
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,580
I don't think we will lose,
even without me.

278
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,890
- Just tell us it's 1 o'clock.
- This time, we will make it!

279
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,320
Six of the merchants
and four of the gladiators are left.

280
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
- Seriously.
- Ready!

281
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,120
Fight!

282
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,180
[The gears start rotating again.]

283
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,640
The time is...

284
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
[6 o'clock!]

285
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,320
[Three of them block one tightly.]

286
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,090
[Tae Yang runs fast.]

287
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,010
[Catch Tae Yang!]

288
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,950
[Dae Sung and Seung Ri
run to help Tae Yang.]

289
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,440
Tae Yang is fast.

290
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,410
[Tae Yang's specialty, the header!]

291
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,720
[The pink alien is back!]

292
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,950
[The four of them are united!]

293
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,750
- Do something!
- My arms are numb!

294
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,260
We need to do something about it!

295
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,060
[Tickle, tickle]

296
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,810
[The merchants are interrupting Tae Yang.]

297
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,980
[In a hurry, wearing plastic wrap
on his head...]

298
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,690
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuck...
[Stop the singing!]

299
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,180
- Cuckoo!
- How can we lose again?

300
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,520
[Tae Yang calmly succeeds
at singing cuckoo.]

301
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,010
What are you doing?

302
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,460
6 o'clock.

303
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,060
Tae Yang bit him?

304
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,580
[I got bitten.]

305
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,520
[Things like that happen
when you play games.]

306
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,630
[Ha Ha, Ji Hyo, and Seung Ri succeeded.]

307
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,460
I'm so frustrated.

308
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,440
He keeps blocking us
and doesn't let us do anything.

309
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,290
We should make him leave.

310
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,090
- How can we do that?
- We can't unless he sings.

311
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,030
Can we stop them from
singing by hitting the side?

312
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,210
It'll sound like 'Ugh koo!'

313
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,720
[Try it if you can.]

314
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,990
It's four vs. two.

315
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,240
If two gladiators succeed, it'll be over.

316
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,550
Ready, set!

317
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,950
[5 o'clock.]

318
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,640
[Jong Kook is the fastest!]

319
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,610
Get in!

320
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,630
[Dae Sung, we'll be set
if you get in now.]

321
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,830
[Wait for me, Jong Kook!]

322
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,350
Wait, Jong Kook!

323
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,750
[Where are you Dae Sung?]
Get in, Dae Sung!

324
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,980
[I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
It might take some time...]

325
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,410
Dae Sung!

326
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,410
Dae Sung, get in!

327
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,860
[Dae Sung barely escapes...]

328
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,810
[and tries to get through their legs.]

329
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,040
Dae Sung!

330
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,720
[Meanwhile, Jae Suk and Gary
try breaking through...]

331
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,380
[Easy Brothers knocked
Dae Sung on the gear.]

332
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,060
[Jong Kook keeps holding the clock.]

333
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,460
[Dae Sung manages
to escape from the Easy Brothers]

334
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,860
[and going in from the bottom again.]

335
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,270
I'm in...

336
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,010
[What chaos!]

337
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,040
[While Jong Kook blocks
Gary and Jae Suk...]

338
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,670
[Dae Sung watches the rotation.]

339
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,840
[When he's near the clock,
Dae Sung starts tickling them.]

340
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,890
Dae Sung, hurry up!

341
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm in!

342
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,780
[Where are you going?]

343
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,980
Dae Sung!

344
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,780
[Gary is thrown.]

345
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,470
[Big-nosed brother replaces Gary.]

346
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,810
[Who are you?]

347
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,780
[Two Suks under one roof.]

348
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,550
They might do it!

349
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,750
What time is it?
Cuckoo!

350
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't know what time it is.
I forgot!

351
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,110
5 o'clock.

352
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,210
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

353
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,460
[Jae Suk succeeds at it.]

354
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,830
Good job!

355
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,550
Dae Sung, you should have gotten in.

356
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,810
[He went in...]

357
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,030
[He got back out after a moment.]

358
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,810
My body feels like...

359
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,210
as if I went inside a cage full of dogs.

360
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,980
What should we do?
[Who will block Kim Jong Kook now?]

361
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,290
We need to get rid of Jong Kook...

362
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,440
Hey, that's little too much.
Get rid of me?

363
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,180
- Let me go this time.
- No, let me.

364
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,440
No, let me leave.

365
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,240
They don't want to be the last one.

366
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,780
- Let me leave.
- I should.

367
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,320
Do you want me to face a
tricky ride at this age?

368
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,150
Maybe you're shameless
at that age.

369
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,120
I need to keep my dignity.

370
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Three people left.
I like what I'm looking at.

371
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,580
When was the last time
you were nervous?

372
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Ready!

373
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,070
[The winner will be able to choose
the first and second gate.]

374
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,180
Set!

375
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,380
[3 o'clock, starts!]

376
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,520
[Jong Kook and Dae Sung get
to the clock at the same time.]

377
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,150
[With just his face,
he has become a variety wonderkid]

378
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,010
It's over!

379
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,010
[He's screaming for losing his fans!]

380
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,240
One, two, three!
Dae Sung!

381
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,040
Jong Kook!
Who grabbed my feet?

382
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,690
Hurry up, Dae Sung.

383
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,550
[When Dae Sung gets in,
the barricade Jong Kook starts blocking.]

384
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,260
[That face... is more like art.]

385
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,780
[They try to stop Dae Sung...]

386
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,380
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

387
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,630
[The barricade Jong Kook
succeeds at blocking.]

388
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm done!

389
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,780
Look at them.

390
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,290
They're watching
the game in peace.

391
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,920
Because they know they will win...

392
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,490
I will protect Big Bang!

393
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,040
[Hooray, Jong Kook!]

394
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,520
Let's do our best.

395
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,070
Now, it's about who will betray first.

396
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,270
I'm dizzy.
I'm about to throw up.

397
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,750
Hurry up!

398
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,980
We'll attack him at the same time.

399
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,860
Are you ready?

400
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,070
[Jong Kook is surrounded by them.]

401
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,230
It's better if you let me go.

402
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,610
At least, one person will remain.

403
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,920
[If Jong Kook succeeds,
The Gladiators will win.]

404
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,550
[6 o'clock, starts!]

405
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,380
[Mr. Capable's full power.]

406
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,920
[We can't lose like this!]

407
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
[After the running...]

408
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,860
[Horror!]

409
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,150
[We're lucky that he's on our team.]

410
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,520
Beat him on the side!

411
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,180
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

412
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,320
[Jong Kook easily succeeds.]

413
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,580
We won!

414
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,350
[The Gladiators win the first mission.]

415
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,750
[They can choose the first and
the second gate of the final race.]

416
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,350
<i>There are two options
for the fist gate.</i>

417
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,670
<i>Look at the options,
and decide now.</i>

418
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,660
They might pick a bad one.

419
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,120
This one.

420
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,270
[Water]
[Carbonated drink]

421
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,380
- This one is better.
- Of course!

422
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,410
This is easy to pick.

423
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,260
- Okay, give it to us.
- What is it?

424
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,520
Carbonated drink?
Maybe we need to drink and whistle.

425
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,180
Okay, we'll take it.

426
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,270
We wanted to pick this one
from the start.

427
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,890
We have Kwang Soo.

428
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,780
Kwang Soo and I can drink soda fast.

429
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,490
I can drink it fast, too.

430
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,780
You're giving us the second gate, too?

431
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,460
Let us pick first!

432
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,150
[Straight]
[Curve]

433
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,810
This kind of stuff...

434
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,520
This one.
But we never know...

435
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,520
They're so happy.

436
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
Anyway, the final race will be a relay.

437
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,720
Pick this one.

438
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,090
Dae Sung is smart!

439
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,030
That's right!

440
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,980
Give it to us.

441
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,120
T.O.P is laughing a lot.

442
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,460
You must have picked a good one.

443
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,040
What is it?

444
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,350
[I'm so happy.]

445
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,120
- It's good.
- Okay!

446
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,920
They must have picked 'straight.'

447
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,580
Maybe the curve is a good one.

448
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,720
[How will this card
influence the final race?]

449
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,010
Was this game okay for you?

450
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,810
Yes, it was fun.

451
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,950
You've only gone once.

452
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,580
You say it was fun?

453
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,690
We haven't even started yet.

454
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,780
I was going to give up
in the middle.

455
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,460
You came back out few times,
and we pushed you back.

456
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,320
I thought I couldn't make it.

457
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,580
I couldn't break through the wrap.

458
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,750
If we win the second game too,
we'll be able to pick all the gates.

459
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,780
What would be 'straight'?

460
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,010
I think it's about driving.

461
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,460
I think we will drive
since we're here.

462
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,320
- Then is this for a track?
- I wonder if we'll drive cars.

463
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,580
I wonder if they will
give us tricycles.

464
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,210
[It won't be anything simple...]

465
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,010
Maybe they will tie our legs
and make us race?

466
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,270
[They're making all kinds of guesses.]

467
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,750
There's got to be something.

468
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,410
In any case, 'straight' is
better than 'curve.'

469
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,460
It's so hot today.

470
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,670
Hot air comes from the outside.

471
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,240
[He looks at something...]

472
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,980
It's pretty hot, right?

473
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,260
I turned on the heating.

474
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,950
Why did you turn it on?

475
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,810
I was wondering why it was so hot.

476
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,690
It was strange.

477
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,750
It's hot summer!

478
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,410
[The merchant team is
having fun on the road.]

479
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,580
[Silent]

480
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,720
[Here, sleeping...]

481
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,610
[there, sleeping]

482
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,920
[Everywhere sleeping...]

483
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,350
[They've only completed one mission,
but are totally exhausted.]

484
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,410
We're here.

485
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,070
[Opens their eyes.]

486
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,520
[His eyes look bigger.]

487
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,580
[Where are we?]

488
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,070
[A cool valley with a nice stream.]

489
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,810
[What is the next mission?]

490
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,980
Let's get off.

491
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,810
We're here.

492
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,610
This is the main dish, but we've
wasted our energy for the appetizer.

493
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,290
[Half-asleep.]

494
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,120
I'll give you the rules.

495
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
Across the ages and in all countries

496
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,580
people enjoy this ball game.

497
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,210
- A ball game?
- Foot volleyball!

498
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,320
Dodgeball!

499
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,890
That is basketball.

500
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,550
[Basket ball?]

501
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,640
<i>A red flag warning
is issued in Yeongnam.</i>

502
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,780
<i>Now, it is expanded to
Jeonnam and Kangwon.</i>

503
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,490
<i>Today is the hottest day...</i>

504
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,210
[Are you serious?]

505
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,670
<i>In the water, you will see the
basketball posts on both sides.</i>

506
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,060
<i>You will play with a special ball
that becomes heavy when wet.</i>

507
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,260
<i>Five players for each team.</i>

508
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,240
[Big Bang and Running Man's
epic performance.]

509
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,810
[Water basketball.]
[Are you ready?]

510
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,890
[They've changed into uniforms.]

511
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,860
[Naive look]

512
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,980
It's been such a long time
since I've seen Dae Sung like that.

513
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,580
He's back to his old image.

514
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,470
He looks the same
as in 'Family's Outing.'

515
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,980
Look at GD, he's wearing
the towel differently.

516
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,410
Don't do that!

517
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,610
How did you do that?

518
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,320
Why are you so fashionable?

519
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Why did he tie it differently?

520
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,290
It's not like you'll
look like him anyway!

521
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,460
Why not?
We'll be the same if we do that.

522
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,300
We can all be GD,
if we wear it the same way.

523
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,610
We can't be GD.

524
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,260
[A trendsetter and a village foreman.]

525
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,670
[Do you have to be handsome
to be fashionable?]

526
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,380
<i>Will Running Man
get the ball first?</i>

527
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,490
- Yes, we will attack first.
- No, let us!

528

[The Gladiators vs. The Merchants]
[1: 0]

540
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,780

542
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,270
[The Basketball Man, Dae Sung.]
You looked awesome!

543
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,720
I'll show you what I can do!

544
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,550
[The Merchants get the ball now.]

545
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,010
[Ha Ha is hiding behind the Gladiators.]

546

[I see you, got it!]

547
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,520
[Home Run!]

548
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,290
[Ha Ha is shorter than I thought...]

549

[He gets the ball in the face.]

550
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,030

[You're awesome, Kang Gary!]

562
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,410
[An ugly lay-up shot.]

563
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,610
[Are you dancing a ballet?]

564
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,670
I messed it up.

565
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,090

[The Merchants were put in a corner.]

572
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,440
[They barely steal the ball.]

573
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,350
[Steal]

574
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,230
[Gary intercepts again.]

575
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,890

for a fast break.]

579
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,270

got, it's no use if you fail at it.]

580

[The ball is passed to
the Flame Shooter, Tae Yang.]

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,750
[and makes a shot?]

[The Merchants, changing the players]

591
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,150

[Who's going to switch with him?]

593
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,920

[Big-nose brother is substituted
and Captain Yoo is added.]

595

What were you doing, Suk Jin?

596
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,230
I played pretty well.

597
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,720
Big Bang, Big Bang!

598
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,460

and cheering for Big Bang.]

[GD's interception.]

600

Writers, can't you keep it down?

601
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,460

GD gets the ball.

602
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,810
[A loose ball situation]

603

[The king of cheating.]

611
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,320
[It's a loose ball situation again.]

the ball and passes it.]

616
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,950
- You can't do that!
- My hands did it.

617
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,750
- Apologize then.
- I'm sorry.

618
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh, that's how it is?

619
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,380
Because I don't control
my hands, either.

620
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,290
My hands did it.
I don't know.

621
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,950
[The Gladiators are
unrelenting in their attacks.]

after it went inside.]

[What a thrilling moment!]

631
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,060
You can't hit the ball
when it's inside the hoop!

632
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,090
Okay, I see.

633
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,490
Okay, I apologize.

634
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,890
[You're going too far...]

635
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,580
Can I switch?
[Mr. Capable makes a charge.]

636
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll block the other team
while you pass the ball.

637
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,950
Like a football.

638
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,490
[Don't be so scary...]

639
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,810
[Pass]

640

[Giraffe is helpless
in front of Mr. Capable.]

648

by controlling the rebound.]

[The Gladiators vs. The Merchants]
[6: 2]

650
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,810
Good, good!

651
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,490
[What am I going to do
with that monster?]

652
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,610
[What is there to do?]

653
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,690
[Giving him a scalp massage
with a sponge ball.]

654
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,720

[The Gladiators vs. The Merchants]
[6: 3]

Did you hit me?

Sometimes, it happens during a game!

659
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,950
I apologize!
I'm really sorry!

660
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,840
[Is anyone doing the laundry
with a battledore?]

661
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,210
[It led to a bench-clearing brawl.]

662

[Giraffe throws
a punch of revenge.]

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,410
[Run!]

669
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,440
[Shot?]

[Alley-oop!]

671
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,430
[It was a pass even though
it seemed like a shot.]

672
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,780
[They performed like
professionals from the NBA.]

673
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,210
[The Gladiators vs. The Merchants]
[7: 3]

674
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,260
- We need to cheat.
- You should go one-on-one.

675
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,780
We should pass it high for him.

676
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,920
Within his arms reach.

677
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,950
But the ball is pretty heavy.

678
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,350
Try running!

679
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,060
We need defense.
It's important.

680
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,280
People who remember me
from 'Family's Outing'

681
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,890
Didn't I improve?

682
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,890
I'm not who I used to be.

683
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,410
I'm not as clumsy as I was.

684
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,150
I improved.

685
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,690
Did you see the alley-oop?

686
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,860
We need to cheat.

687
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,490
[Skills... or strength...
We're not a good match for them.]

688

[We don't really have a choice...]

Let's do it!

690

One, two, three!
Fight!

691
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,810
Will it change anything?

692
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,410
He's annoying.

693
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,490
I'll punch him in the face
when I turn 80.

694
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,210
[The second half of the game begins.]

695

[Should I start now?]

699
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,750
We need to guard!

700
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,210
[Let's go!]

701
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,380
[The ace makes a charge.]

702

[Will he show us another fancy skill?]

703
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,690

00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,430
- We need to dry them first.
- Give me back!

881
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,430
I need a clothesline.
Bring it lower.

882
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:46,810
- What are you doing?
- It's too wet.

883
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,490
[He likes this kind of boxer...]

884
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,430
- What are you doing?
- Wear it.

885
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,490
Go ahead.
He won't be able to come out.

886
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,460
Jong Kook is crying.

887
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,470
Give him some Kleenex!

888
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,490
[I won't forget this humiliation.]

889
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,120
[One day, when I stand up
I'll have my revenge...]

890
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,690
[I'll be back.]

[The Gladiators vs. The Merchants]
[14: 14]

892
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,890
Each team needs one point.

893
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,550
One shot and it's over!

894
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,240
[Pass]
Oh no!

895
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,690
[Steal]

896
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,440
[What a great opportunity!]

897
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,350
Take it!

898
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,920
[Be calm and score one point...]

899
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,890
Alley-oop!

900
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,520
No!

901
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,950
[GD puts his heart and soul.]

902
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,290
Throw it!

903
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,350
[Steal]

904
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,320
[Goal in!]

[Pitiable]

908
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,580
He's the fairy from
'A Fairy And A Woodcutter.'

909
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,290
Jong Kook is the fairy?

910
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,920
Why are the writers
all wearing sunglasses?

911
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,210
Do you want to take
a good look at Jong Kook?

912
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,150
[Bingo!]

913
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,610
[It's time to appreciate Spartakkuks.]

[The water basketball is over...]

915

We won by force.

916
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,060
Hey, GD...

917
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,920
You acted like you
weren't interested at first.

918
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,320
- T.O.P and all of you!
- It's not even funny!

919
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,920
So, we're allowed to do this?

920
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,520
- What are you talking about?
- No one saw you.

921
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,030
Mind your manners and get dressed.
We're on TV.

922
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,150
He exercised a lot.
I guess he wants to show off.

923
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,950
[Wait and see!]
Should I make you naked, too?

924
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,150
It was a great strategy!

925
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,290
Pick an option for the third gate.

926
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:09,380
- We should pick 'Short.'
- Why?

927
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,260
What if it's like chopsticks?

928
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,920
- Long and short?
- This one is difficult.

929
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,810
We wouldn't have
known what to pick, either.

930
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,430
We should pick 'short.'

931
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,520
- Take the 'long.'
- Okay.

932
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,920
And for the last gate.

933
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,180
- Big.
- Let's pick 'small.'

934
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,290
We picked 'short'
so pick 'small.'

935
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,470
- Should we keep consistency?
- No, just to be safe.

936
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,630
What if it's something huge?

937
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,750
Pick 'small.'

938
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,200
- Should I pick 'small'?
- Pick 'big.'

939
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,640
- Why?
- I have a feeling.

940
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,490
Small is good.

941
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,430
Big things are not
good for speedy games.

942
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,860
You've picked for all the gates.

943
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,290
Now you only have the last mission,
which is the racing.

944
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,350
As you decided...

945
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,920
[What are they doing?]

946
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,750
[Oops]
As you decided...

947
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,210
Why did you make them miserable?

948
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,180
They're doing laundry next to me.

949
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,010
You have only one mission to do.

950
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,780
Let's go!

951
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,010
[Go to the last mission site
of 'The Time Track Race.']

952
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,260
Jong Kook, you look...

953
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,410
- Shut up!
- I envy you, Jong Kook!

954

of 'The Time Track Race.']

955
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,780
[The Gladiators enter the racing circuit.]

956
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,380
Why do they look so cool?

957
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,690
[They get a head start
from the beginning.]

958
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,030
You're not that cool, Dae Sung.

959
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,210
Please tell me I look cool.

960
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,680
The last mission of
'The Time Track Race'

961
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,840
'is 'The Running Car Race.'

962
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,060
Racing?

963
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,010
From the first to the fourth gate
you will travel in the cars.

964
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,270
You will get out of the car
for the missions and keep going.

965
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,090
We can't go back if we don't
complete the missions.

966
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,690
We can't go home?

967
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,350
[Dae Sung, focus!]

968
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,860
The sun is setting...

969
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,270
All day long, we've tried
to go back to the past.

970
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,460
You've picked the options for each gate.

971
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,870
- Water and carbonated drink.
- Straight and curve.

972
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,520
Short and big.

973
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,210
We have small and long.

974
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,660
- Are you showing us now?
- I think short is good.

975
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,720
[The options are revealed.]

976
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,410
Listen carefully.

977
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,030
The fist mission is
'Drink and flip.'

978
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,610
All of you will participate
at the first gate.

979
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,610
Everyone must get out of the car.

980
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,810
According to the options

981
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,410
water and soda will be served.

982
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,120
- Drink it first.
- Taking turns?

983
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,030
We need to flip the cup
so it's upside down.

984
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,890
The next person repeats.

985
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,520
When all of the cups are upside down

986
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,980
get back in the car and leave.

987
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,290
At the second gate,
you'll be doing 'The Abacus racing.'

988
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,860
- Like in-line skates?
- One person will pull in front?

989
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,150
Just one member will get out of the car.

990
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,920
And you'll see abacuses.

991
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,890
Get on the abacuses and
complete your courses.

992
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:43,890
One person gets out and finishes
the curved course on the abacuses.

993
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,040
Your feet need to stay on the abacuses.

994
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,810
At the third gate

995
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,490
you will play
'The Flagpole teamwork.'

996
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,060
Five people stand in a circle

997
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,380
Switch spots in one direction
until you're back to the original spot.

998
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,610
- Then 'long' is better.
- We have 'long.'

999
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,690
The flagpole should
not touch the ground.

1000
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:07,210
When you're done,
get back to your car.

1001
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,550
We picked the good ones.

1002
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,550
At the last gate

1003
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,010
You need two people here

1004
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,860
to play 'Win the knapsack.'

1005
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,860
You will see two walls are built.

1006
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,580
You need use your body
to break down the walls.

1007
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,810
When the knapsack drops,
pick it up and get in the car.

1008
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,470
So, it's good if we picked 'big'?

1009
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,950
When you're all done

1010
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,520
stop the car at the start line.

1011
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,230
We'll find the 'Back-To Car.'

1012
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,460
When everyone gets in
the car and closes the doors...

1013
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,040
We might bump into
each other and fight, right?

1014
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,550
Do whatever you want.

1015
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,720
What do you mean?

1016
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,180
You need to say 'no.'

1017
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,580
What if they take our pants off again?

1018
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,750
I guess, it was traumatic for Tae Yang.

1019
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,520
Don't do such things!

1020
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,720
You understand the last mission?

1021
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,210
Get in the car!

1022
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,610
- Do you decide now?
- Yes, now.

1023
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,380
Who will walk on the curved course?

1024
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,060
The first one is for everyone,
so it doesn't matter.

1025
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,040
The next one is for two people.

1026
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,180
- Two and two?
- Two and one.

1027
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,750
Who is a fast runner?

1028
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,810
[The experienced and skilled Merchants.]

1029
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,750
- For the five, everyone except me...
- Why?

1030
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,210
So, I can drive right away.

1031
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,920
Will you be able to...

1032
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,920
do the abacus one well?
[The hottest idol cares about looks.]

1033
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,520
We made good choices.

1034
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,670
- They're not bad.
- All good except the last one.

1035
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,430
Should we win?

1036
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,030
Of course we should!

1037
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,290
But we picked bad ones.

1038
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,030
It's okay.
We can do it.

1039
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:49,460
- Someone who's good at running...
- But abacuses are unstable.

1040
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,410
They have the straight course.

1041
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,010
Don't smile so cute, GD!

1042
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:56,580
T.O.P's profile looks very handsome.

1043
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,060
[T.O.P's intense gaze.]

1044
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,460
You must be happy.

1045
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,460
Should I wear the hairstyle?

1046
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,180
You're already wearing it.
Your hairstyle is the same as his.

1047
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,580
[The same hairstyle,
different impressions.]

1048
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,810
[Ji Yong is about to take a photo.]

1049
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:17,180

01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,150
[We know how!]

1228
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,180
- One, two, three!
- We can do it!

1229
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,550
Focus!

1230
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:01,090
[They need to do it
two times straight.]

1231
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,150
[Acrobatic move.]

1232
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,030
One more time!

1233
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,610
- Calm down.
- Focus!

1234
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,460
Last one!

1235
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,240
[Both teams need to
succeed one more time.]

1236
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,610
[Win or lose?]

1237
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,010
[Their last jump.]

1238
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:23,070
[Which team will depart first?]

1239
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,630
[They fail.]

1240
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,240
One, two, three?
[What about the Gladiators?]

1241
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,100
[Grab!]
We did it!

1242
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,430
[They did it five times straight.]

1243
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,380
[The Merchants have to start over.]
Concentrate on it!

1244
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,270
Okay, we did it!

1245
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,380
[They're lucky because
the Merchants picked 'short'.]

1246
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,070
It's so tiring.

1247
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,090
[Good luck.]
One, two, three!

1248
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,010
We still have time!

1249
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,550
What happened?

1250
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:11,290
[They are at hairpin section again.]

1251
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,290
[Jong Kook, don't push it too hard.]

1252
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,720
[I'll show it to my brothers!]

1253
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:22,460
[A flowing parabolic cornering.]

1254
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,750
- Very good.
- We're almost here!

1255
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,860
That's the wall?

1256
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:34,320
They look very thick.

1257
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,580
- Just two more!
- Very good!

1258
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,180
One, two, three!

1259
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,610
[They managed to finish
it five times in a low.]

1260
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,870
[Busy, busy!]

1261
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,180
[There's no time to lose!]

1262
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,690
[He immediately accelerates the car!]

1263
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,630
[They arrive at the hairpin section.]

1264
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:56,240
[The car gets a brush with the bumps.]
[Yoo Hyuk's bold handling.]

1265
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,920
[He drives like an expert.]

1266
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,810
Do we have to break it down?
How?

1267
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,920
[They bump into the wall.]

1268
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,230
[It's not shaky at all.]
It doesn't move at all!

1269
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,350
[To drop the small knapsack,
they need to repeat is numerous times.]

1270
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,920
Do they need to make it drop?

1271
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,150
Let me do it, T.O.P.

1272
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:22,720
[At that moment, the Merchants
arrive at the fourth gate.]

1273
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,520
It won't be easy!

1274
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,230
What do we need to do?

1275
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,690
[It's not too late!]
You need to break it down.

1276
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:34,380
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo, go!
Get in the driver seat, Ha Ha.

1277
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,210
[Maybe it's easier for the big knapsack.]

1278
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,380
[Kkuk attacks the bottom.]

1279
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,410
[Both knapsack didn't move a bit.]

1280
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:52,580
[We will win!]

1281
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,920
[Tiger's second charge!]

1282
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:59,870
It dropped!

1283
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,010
[The small knapsack drops first!]

1284
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,580
[I'm sorry, T.O.P!]

1285
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,210
- They did it!
- Hurry up and get back!

1286
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,030
[The other wall collapsed, too.[

1287
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,460
Hurry up!

1288
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,090
Kwang Soo, hurry up!

1289
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:32,040
[In a rush]
They picked theirs up, too.

1290
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,920
Ha Ha, take the bundle from him.

1291
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,890
Give it to me and drive.
Just throw it!

1292
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,030
Let's go!

1293
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:44,230
[To the last mission, go!]

1294
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,810
[Speed up!]

1295
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,380
We need to get in the 'Back-To Car.'

1296
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,380
[What a fierce chase!]

1297
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,320
- What's the last one?
- This was the last one.

1298
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,550
Oh, the five people...

1299
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,290
we need to get in the small car
and travel though time!

1300
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:07,580
[The Speed Race, the last mission!]

1301
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,750
[All the team members
must get into the 'Back-To Car'!]

1302
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,720
[The Gladiators are ahead.]
[But the Merchants are behind them.]

1303
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,610
[Maximum speed]

1304
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,180
Drive faster!

1305
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,060
Where do I need to go?

1306
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,210
What's wrong with the road?

1307
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,840
It's almost over.
It's just a car race.

1308
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,840
[I see them!]

1309
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:40,120
[After passing this curvy course,
there's the last gate!]

1310
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,030
[The Gladiators enter into
the last straight section.]

1311
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,350
[The Merchants chase them fiercely.]

1312
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,890
That car over there!

1313
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,350
We're here!

1314
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,040
We need to get in the car!

1315
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,860
Get ready to get out.

1316
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,810
[Every second counts!]

1317
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,630
[Which team...]

1318
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:14,070
[will arrive at the fifth gate first?]

1319
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,230
[The Gladiators get there first!]

1320
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,720
Get out!

1321
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,410
We'll get out first!
Let's go!

1322
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:24,030
[Now, it's a running contest by foot!]

1323
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:27,980
[After being the passengers the whole time,
everyone is running all of a sudden!]

1324
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:32,580
[All the team members get in the car,
this car goes back to the past!]

1325
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,580
[The Gladiators preoccupy the good spots.]

1326
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,690
[Are they playing
'Ring Around the Rosie'?]

1327
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:44,610
Push them out!

1328
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,550
Open the door!

1329
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:48,610
[No way!]

1330
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,490
Get in!

1331
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,640
[Five members of the
Gladiators got into the car.]

1332
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,750
[They can go back to the past
only if Dae Sung gets in.]

1333
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,950
- What about me?
- You can't go!

1334
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,260
Jae Suk!

1335
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,610
[In the confusion, Yoo Hyuk
grabs an opportunity.]

1336
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,870
[Now, five members of the Merchants
are in the car as well!]

1337
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:19,690
[Only these two are left out!]

1338
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,040
[Inside the car, a fierce battle
for seats broke out!]

1339
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,120
[A bloody fight for
going back to the past.]

1340
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,030
Dae Sung, come to the driver's seat!

1341
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,870
Dae Sung shakes off Kwang Soo
and finally gets in the car.

1342
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:38,920
Go away!
[Giraffe's clinging strategy.]

1343
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,640
[Giraffe's clinging tactic.]

1344
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,350
Wait!
He's like a leech!

1345
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,070
[Push!]

1346
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,810
[Go away, Kwang Soo!]

1347
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,260
[I want to go back to the pas...]

1348
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,260
[Bye!]

1349
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,040
Close the door!

1350
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,210
The Gladiators are the winners!

1351
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:11,120
[The Gladiators win
'The Time Track Race'!]

1352
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,210
[Now...]

1353
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,520
[Go back to the past!]

1354
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,520
Let's go back to Rome!

1355
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,810
[Let's go to the Gladiators'
hometown, Rome!]

1356
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,640
Sparta!

1357
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,380
[Are they really leaving?]

1358
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,430
[We have no idea...]

1359
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:44,950
[Back To The Past!]

1360
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:48,520
Wait for us, we'll be back!

1361
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,410
[That's how Big Bang
went back to the past...]

1362
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,260
[Let's pretend they left, and
now they're back to the present!]

1363
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,470
It's been three and a half years since
we've been on a show together.

1364
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:08,210
It was really nice having fun together.

1365
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,490
I was happy to be on a Korean TV show.

1366
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:16,630
- What are you talking about?
- Are you a foreigner?

1367
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,750
[They've been busy overseas.]

1368
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,860
- Thanks to Jong Kook...
- Don't mention it!

1369
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,290
I will protect Big Bang!

on a variety show.

I had so much fun
seeing my friends again.

1372
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,600
Visit us more often.

1373
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,210
I thought we were filming
'Family's Outing' for a second.

1374
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:38,320
Invite us again.

1375
