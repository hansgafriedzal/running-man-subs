You can unleash your powers if you
have a match of Go with the expert.

When you get the
'unleash stamp' from the expert

will show in the book.

If we don't win, we can't leave.

292
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,460
It needs to be
something like stone fight.

Jackstones using Go stones.

294

We just have to win one more than him.

301
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,230
I'm really detailed when I draw,
so I usually take a long time...

302
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,540
Just draw one, and
make sure people can tell.

303
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Speed is important.
Do you draw fast?

304
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,680
Just because I'm an artist,
it doesn't mean my drawings are great.

305

with the first topic.

Animals are hard to draw!

312
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,410
I'll draw the animals on the right,
you draw from the left.

313
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,880

[He even finishes drawing
the sea lion speedily.]

318

319
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,060
- Is the middle black?
- A skunk?

320
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,530
- I don't know...
- Where's the white part?

321
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,870
Just draw him farting!

322
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,010
That's a squirrel!

323
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,380
- I don't know where the white part is...
- Just draw him farting.

Where's the red part?
Is it the middle?

328
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,720
- There red somewhere... the eyes?
- Just draw the key parts.

329

Jin Ho, what do you have left?

330
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,810
I'm drawing an anteater, right now.

331
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,920
You're drawing all the ants one by one?

332

'if you win once,
you can unleash your powers.'

345
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,080
'You must each sing a verse from
children's songs by taking turns.'

346
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,920
'It is important to sing your song and not
get confused by your opponent's song.'

347
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,480
[One verse karaoke]

348
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,750
We sing a different
song by taking turns?

349
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,060
But we have to sing our own.

350
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,260
I think we'll get confused...

351
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,090
Then I'll go first.

352
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,200
Here, miss expert.

353
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,170
Oh, you must like the color blue.

354
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,170
Pick one.

355
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,740
Pick your favorite color.

356
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,240
The expert's song is...

357
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,940
'Little Calf.'

358
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,350
- Oh, 'Little Calf.'
- You know the song, right?

359
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,550
[The children's song that everyone
knows is the song for the expert?]

360
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,220
Should we open ours, then?

361
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,450
[Then what song did
Kkuk and Soo Ji draw?]

362
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,690
'Icicle.'

363
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,290
<i>Icicle, icicle.</i>

364
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,800
- You don't know it?
- No, I have no clue!

365
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,200
- Why don't you know it?
- What song is that?

366
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,690
Did you spend your
childhood exercising?

367
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,260
- Yes, I did.
- Really?

368
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,070
[Kkuk will be starting
first as their rep.]

369
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,350
<i>Little calf, little calf.
Spotted little calf.</i>

370
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,720
<i>Ici... cle.</i>

371
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,380
[Super low-pitched]

372
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,290
[Head shot]

373
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,520
This is hard... this is really hard!

374
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,560
- Did it hurt?
- It was too hard!

375
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,260
It was too hard!

376
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,760
Can I do this instead?
This hurts so much!

377
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,100
She can raise her leg
instead of her hand.

378
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,070
Me, me!

379
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,210
[It's hard to sing different
songs and taking turns.]

380
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,110
<i>Icicle, icicle.
Wait, that's not it.</i>

381
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,610
[That's butterfly.
Are you going to make the icicle fly?]

382
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,750
[Second try]

383
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,090
<i>Little calf, little calf.</i>

384
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,190
<i>I... cicle!</i>

385
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,930
[A gymnast's defense]
It's right!

386
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,630
[It's not i.. cicle, it's icicle.]

387
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,900
We sang it like this
in our neighborhood!

388
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,470
[Which neighborhood adds a
groove in a children's song?]

389
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,870
It's a variation!

390
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,440
[No improvisation allowed
for a strict evaluation!]

391
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,720
Well, here is the mission
you have to complete.

392
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,790
The sound master.

393
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,530
If you find a student that can replicate
the voice that the expert shows you

394
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,330
you can unleash your powers.

395
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,000
[You want us to find a
voice doppelganger?]

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,940
If that student's voice
is over 90% accurate

397
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,010
then you will get a stamp, and
your powers will be unleashed.

398
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,150
[What is this...]
Can you do it?

399
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,350
You must not be on good terms
with the producers...

400
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,120
[Otherwise, this kind of
labor is unnecessary...]

401
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,760
I will let you hear the
first voice for the mission.

402
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,920
You have to listen to it carefully.

403
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,160
You unmannerly bastard!

404
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
It's Yoon Mun Sik!

405
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
'You unmannerly bastard!'

406
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
But they have to be really old...

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,070
As long as their
speech pattern is the same.

408
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,340
You know T.O.P is really good
at imitating this, too!

409
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,610
[Accuracy is 98%, Yoon Mun Top!]

410
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,380
Ha Ha, on the move!

411
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,510
- We have to do it together!
- I need to save energy.

412
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
Hurry!

413
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,510
I'll be here.

414
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,420
Who is able to imitate Yoon Mun Sik?

415
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,690
- Show them once.
- Who can do 'you unmannerly bastard'?

416
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,560
[Many challengers are coming to them.]

417
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,760
You unmannerly... sorry!

418
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,530
- You unmannerly bastard!
- Wow!

419
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,700
- Louder, louder.
- Raise it by one octave.

420
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,940
- It's too low.
- You unmannerly bastard!

421
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,070
- He has a possibility!
- He's good.

422

[A challenger with a
bowl haircut is here.]

423
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,380
Oh, you look like you can do it well!
Start!

424
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,410
- You unmannerly bastard!
- Make it longer.

425
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,820
You unmannerly bastard!
This bastard...

426
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,190
[It was my style of acting.]

427
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,090
Try it one at a time.
We need to vote.

428
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,430
- Ready, set!
- You unmannerly bastard!

429

- You unmannerly bastard!
- You unmannerly bastard!

430
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,170
- You unmannerly bastard!
- They're going to fight!

431
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,670
Thank you!
See you again soon!

432
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,140
- You need to make it clear.
- And higher.

433
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,880
Like this, you unmannerly bastard!

434
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,510
It's Yoon Mun Sik!

435

[They enter proudly with the
assumption that they're going to win.]

[Jang Man Gil, 25 years old.]

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,390
- There wasn't much time.
- It's 100 percent!

438
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,750
- It was a little easy...
- It's exactly the same!

439
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,120
- This person sounds exactly the same.
- Are you sure?

440
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,890
You... you... unmannerly bastard!

441
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,780
[What kind of results will they get?]

442
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,340
Wow, it sounds the same!

443
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,170
[Anticipation]

444
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,950
We won, we won.

445
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,110
[They listen to the original again
to make sure it's accurate.]

446
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,210
- You unmannerly bastard!
- It was this long?

447
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,050
It's so long!
Did it stretch out all of a sudden?

448
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,020
Wow, this is too long.

449
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,390
[Long vs. short]

450
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,490
First of all, the length of
the sound is different.

451
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,470
The most important thing
is the speech pattern

452
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,030
but the speed of the sound here...

453
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,940
- the problem is...
- Will is be over 90%?

454
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,440
No, probably around 75%.

455
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,610
[Finding the voice doppelganger,
first attempt fail.]

456
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,340
[Finding Kim Hee Ae's voice.]

457
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,710
Who can imitate it?

458
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,380
This is a top compliment.
[Not similar]

459
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,190
[Similar to the person before]

460
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,390
This is a top compliment!

461
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,820
[Extremely not similar]

462
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,560
[Finding Kim Jong Kook's voice.]

463
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,400
You only play the guitar, right?

464
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
[Promise me that you'll
only play the guitar...]

465
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,030
Just challenge!
Anybody!

466
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,170

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,850
Sorry, I got a little angry.

470
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,850
[Will he be able to]

471
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,850
[complete the mission?]

472
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,220
What is this?
The cooking master.

473
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,960
We wouldn't be making a dish, would we?

474
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,090
Tasting challenge with the chef...
how is this possible?

475
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,900
How do we compete against the expert?

476
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,410
With your eyes and nose covered,
eat different ingredients.

477
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,180
You have to guess the ingredients
the staff call out, in order.

478
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,460
Please go easy on us!

479
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,210
[Gives up as soon as
he hears the mission.]

480
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,230
The first mission is types of powder.

481
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,610
[With the eyes and nose covered,
eat three similar ingredients.]

482
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,380
[Guess the ingredient
before the expert to win.]

483
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,430
[First, is coffee.]

484
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,260
Here's the second.
[Next is brown sugar.]

485
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,940
[When the nose is covered]

486
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,630
[the taste buds become dull
because the smell is part of the taste.]

487
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,900
[The last one is salt.]

488
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,110
[He takes a big mouthful of salt.]

489
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,140
[Yuck]

490
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,310
[It must be salty!]

491
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,480
It's yummy, is there any tequila?

492
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,850
[He must have realized what it was.]

493
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,850
Why isn't there any left?

494
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,220
I'm scared.

495
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,530
[I'm ready]
Answer!

496
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,460
Coffee, then sugar, then salt.

497
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,470
Correct!

498
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,340
[How do we beat the chef?]

499
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,840
[Gary and Suk Jin's mission.]

500
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,310
Play 'catch the thief' with the
expert, and if you win once

501
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,980
you can unleash your powers.

502
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,280
The cards have to be divided
evenly among three players.

503
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:02,150
Then, throw away any cards that
have the same numbers.

504
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,490
Going in order, take a
card from your opponent

505
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,930
and collect all the same numbers
and if you become empty-handed

506
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,500
you can win. The last one who
has the thief card loses.

507
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,300
It's a psychological game.

508
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,000
- He's an expert...
- We're playing this with Pyo Chang Won.

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,310
I would like to help you,
but I can't lose on purpose.

510
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,510
Sorry, please understand
even if we win.

511
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,480
Yes, go ahead.

512
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,420
[Will Big Nose and Gary be able
to beat the crime solver expert?]

513
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,790
We will now start 'catch the thief.'

514
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,990
Please divide the cards.

515
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,490
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

516
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,000
It's a little suspicious,
so I will shuffle it.

517
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Well we never know if

518
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
you did something with
the cards before we got here.

519
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,570
That's a very good attitude.

520
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,710
He doesn't get drawn
into what you said.

521
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,040
Being suspicious is a good
start to solving mysteries.

522
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,480
[Big Nose divides the stack and
hands out 10 cards to each player.]

523
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,520
[Let's see...]

524
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,450
It would be beneficial to have
many of the same numbers.

525
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,360
You really divided them well.

526
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,190
[Gary's cards are 1, 2, 3, and 4]

527
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,330
[and the thief card.]

528
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,830
[Why are you hiding there?]

529
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,700
The person who has the thief card

530
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,810
will probably put it in the middle so that
the next person can pull it out easily.

531
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,870
[Shiver]

532
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,640
Pick one, please.

533
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,350
You have one more card than us.

534
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,710
- Right?
- Yes.

535
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,750
- So you have a higher chance...
- Yes, very high.

536
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,150
Very high.

537
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,520
I don't have it.

538
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't try to be psychological!

539
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,390
I'm being drawn in, right now!

540
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,060
I'm doing it so we don't get drawn in.

541
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,360
I don't want to get drawn in.

542
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,300
Do everything you can.

543
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,140
You said the thief card is
placed usually in the middle.

544
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,440
I will daringly take
the one in the middle.

545
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,480
- Thank you, you gave me a seven.
- Lucky seven.

546
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,650
[He picked a seven and cleared a pair.]

547
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,430
Then I will pick...

548
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,210
[Lame psychological battle]

549
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,780
I will go with the far left.

550
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,490
Do you want this one?
Take it.

551
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,260
Hmm...

552
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,350
[His face is pretty relaxed.]

553
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,290
You and I are in the same boat.

554
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,010
Then I will clear this pair.

555
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,630
[Gary made a pair of nines.]

556
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,010
Here, pick one.

557
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,230
Gary, your eyes keep
shifting to the left.

558
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,410
When I'm with my girlfriend

559
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,180
I always look to the left.

560
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,580
- Is that the truth?
- No, not that one!

561
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,920
[An intense psychological warfare]

562
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,460
Can you even tell by feeling it?

563
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,060
Hmm... is that?

564
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,060
[Look at his reaction...]

565
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,320
[30 years of experience
in solving crimes.]

566
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,180
[The realistic analysis
based on statics.]

567
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,490
[What's the safest card
that all the data tells?]

568
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,150
[The thief came.]

569
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,350
[Oh no...]

570
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,810
[What just happened?]

571
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,380
[Embarrassed]
I picked it precisely.

572
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
[It's too precise...]

573
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,580
Do I keep looking on my left?

574
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,690
I can't normally lie...
I can't lie at all in front of you.

575
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,660
You seemed happy.

576
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,460
I wonder if he picked the thief.

577
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,180
You have seven cards.

578
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,780
I don't think you'll keep the thief
in the middle.

579
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,350
Well...

580
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,150
[He's lured!]

581
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,410
[Nod]

582
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,410
Wait, why did you nod?
It means you want me to pick it.

583
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,810
[We thought you're an expert,
but you're docile.]

584
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,630
Then, I'll pick the one beside.

585
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,720
Oh, I see.
[Total failure]

586
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,350
- He just nodded.
- It's getting better.

587
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,060
[He has dealt with criminals, but he
might not have dealt with cards.]

588
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,690
Who has the thief?

589
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,950
I wanted to pick the card
in the middle for a while.

590
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,830
I think you've noticed that
I like to pick the one in the middle.

591
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,520
So, I think if you have a bad card...

592
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,410
- you would have put it in the middle.
- Is that so?

593
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,720
Yes.
[Preserving the equilibrium]

594
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,830
And the result is...

595
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,030
He isn't very happy.
Then I'll pick this one.

596
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,120
[Suk Jin looked at his face
and pick the card.]

597
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,660
[Dizzy]

598
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,010
Number one!

599
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,410
[He picked number one
and made a pair.]

600
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,290
- Then it means...
- You'll pick this one, and I'm done.

601
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,090
[Big-nose finishes his stack.]

602
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,980
[Huh?]
[Suk Jin's last card was 10?]

603
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,360
[Gary finishes the game, too.]
It's destiny!

604
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,690
Naturally, this card
will be given to you...

605
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,520
[That's how the crime solver
ended up with the thief.]

606
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,030
We won on our first try!

607
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,920
[Bitter]

608
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,320
I had the thief at first...

609
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,430
he picked it when he
made his first comment.

610
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,230
[Detective instinct?]
[He never let the thief go.]

611
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,690
He's perfect for variety shows!

612
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,860
[Gary and Suk Jin's
ability is unleashed!]

613
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,290
Have you played Jackstones before?

614
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,120
- Not with Go stones...
- It's the same.

615
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,380
I never thought Master Cho
would play Jackstones with Go stones.

616
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,610
It's the first time.

617
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,170
The world renown go master
is going to play Jackstones...

618
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,210
I'm in trouble.
How can I win this?

619
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,870
[The one who gets
5 points first will win.]

620
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,720
[Master Cho Hoon Hyun
kicks off the game.]

621
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,950
If I were younger,
I think could play this.

622
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,060
[His moves are pretty fast.]

623
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,430
[It seems that he's played
Jackstones a lot.]

624
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,660
It's the second stage.

625
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,790
Oh no!

626
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,920
[The high pitch voice of his!]

627
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,860
You were really cute.

628
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,780
You must be disappointed.

629
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,120
[The master of Go reveals
his cute scream for Jackstones.]

630
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,060
Ready.
If she can finish...

631
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,880
[Her big hands might be helpful.]

632
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,310
[It's up to you, Yeon Koung.]

633
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,750
[Absent-minded...]

634
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,050
Nice!
Good!

635
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,990
That's right!

636
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,550
- Great!
- This is the critical moment.

637
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,660
[They're going straight into
grabbing two stones at a time.]

638
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,860
- It's nice!
- Very good!

639
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,200
[His fanning is accelerating.]

640
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,520
- The way you grab the stones...
- Oh ho!

641
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,060
That's it, that's it!

642
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,950
[The position of the stones is great.]

643
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,980
It's perfect!

644
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,950
Great!
[An advanced skill, 'the railroad'!]

645
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,810
[Continue the winning streak]

646
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,490
[and sweep all four stones!]

647
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,230
[Now there's only one more left!]

648
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,180
I need to grab all five.

649
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,530
[Wow]

650
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,810
[All five stones at once!]

651
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,660
[They will succeed the
mission if she grabs all five!]

652
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,070
[Fail!]
That was so close!

653
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,010
[Now, the expert needs
to grab four stones.]

[High pitch scream]

655
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,850
[The expert's scream
is quite addicting.]

656
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,820
You are very disappointed.

657
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,460
Because I almost made it.

658
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,040
On your fan,
it's written 'absent-minded.'

659
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,230
But, I'm actually greedy inside.

660
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,460
The fan says 'absentmindedness'
but you're greedy inside?

661
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,180
Wow, you are very..

662
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,750
[Being competitive]
We need to win this.

663
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,670
[It's Yoo Hyuk's turn to snap.]

664
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,120
Three points!
Great!

665
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,040
We gained three points first.

666
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,810
[They need to get two more points.]
Look at the position!

667
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,810
[Who's that person at the back?]

668
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,690
[While Yoo Hyuk passed the first stage]

669
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,260
[Master Cho's wife
is watching their game.]

670
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,490
[The stones are little too close.]

671
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,030
[Yoo Hyuk fails at the stages.]

672
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,200
Oh, she's watching?
Maybe she can try.

673
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,210
- I have small hands.
- I'm not good at it, either.

674
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,240
[The ringer joins the game.]

675
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,580
[The wife of Master Cho
will start from snap.]

676
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,180
- Wow!
- Keep playing.

677
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,580
Start from the first stage again.

678
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,780
- Oh, from the first stage?
- Yes.

679
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,060
It's been a while since
I've played Jackstones.

680
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,490
- She's good...
- Aren't you an expert, ma'am?

681
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,430
[She reassures them
with her modest words.]

682

[Ho ho ho]

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,090
This is bad...

686
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,610
[She failed at grabbing two stones.]
She's so good!

687
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,980
She's really good.

688
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,380
[She has the presence of an expert.]

689

to get two more points![

more stones, he wins.]

is at maximum speed.]

692
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,290
I'm sorry ma'am,
I need to finish it here.

693
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,490
[Three stones survived.]

694
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,270
[Will they be able to
finish it this round?]

695
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,950
[Young fellow...]

696
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,410
[They succeeded in
getting five points!]

697
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,980
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,610
[They can now unleash
the hero's powers!]

699
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,810
I get it now.
I understand the game.

Who will go first?

704
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,780
- Would like to go first?
- I'll go first.

705
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,890
Does it have to be a person?

706
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,580
[Well, I guess a dog
can't really guess...]

707
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,580
- What about the woman over there?
- Oh, us?

708
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,290
Oh, thank you very much.

709
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

710
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,010
- Do you have five minutes?
- Can you solve this quiz?

711
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,230
- Do you like sports?
- Yes.

You ride it... a bobsleigh!

724
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,010
- You have 15 seconds.
- Hurry, hurry!

725
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,550
There aren't many things
to do on the ice...

Oh, figure skating!

727
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,090
Is this right?
[Worry, worry]

728
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,180
What about this?

729
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,500
[Time up]

730
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,150
[They got eight questions right.]

731

There are different
types of sports drawn.

732

sport in the empty space.

it's a similar melody.]

- Oh!
- It's the same, right?

768
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,130
[The graphs looks very similar.]

769
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,980
The similarity is about 91%

[They succeeded the voice
doppelganger mission!]

771

[They retry the tasting
challenge, with three]

[three different jam flavors.]

773
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,450
Strawberry jam, apple jam, grape jam!

774
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,010
[That's correct!]

775
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,410
[They succeeded the tasting challenge!]

[they need to get
a stamp from the expert.]

[Premium benefit after
battling with the experts!]

[The heroes' powers are unleashed!]

781
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,220
[How will these powers be used?]

782
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,980
[Finally, the final match.]

783
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,460

[Jae Suk enters with
the book of secrets.]

787
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,320
Huh?

788
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,660
[He walks through the
passage with green lights.]

789
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,080
You need to open the book
that you received

790
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,480
shout 'summon the hero, '
then place the book down.

791
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,630
Summon my hero!

792
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,350
[Name cloning power.]

793
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,460
[He summons
the Goddess of spikes, Yeon Kyung.]

794
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,920
[Ji Hyo enters next.]

795
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,310
Summon my hero!

796
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,830
[Temporary sending-off power.]

797
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,320
[She summoned the soccer
Crown Prince, Jong Gook.]

798
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,520
Don't leave my side!

799
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,180
- Summon my soul!
- It's hero, not soul.

800
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,560
[He was going to summon a ghost.]

801
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,980
Summon my hero!

802
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,210
[He summoned the historic dunker,
Joo Yup.]

803
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,500
Summon my hero!

804
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,230
[He summoned the game genius, Jin Ho.]

805
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,830
I was gaming, why did you call me?

806
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,150
I was winning...

807
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,180
[He summoned the ribbon fairy, Soo Ji.]

808
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,090
Yes, you have summoned me.

809
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,860
[He summoned the
'Running Man' hero, Suk Jin.]

810
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,830
- We meet again!
- I'll give it all I've got for victory!

811
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,950
I'm going to win today.

812
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,380
- But do you know about this?
- No.

813
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,410
I don't know even after I've read it.

814
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,570
This race is to pick the strongest.
It's the fourth battle.

815
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,120
From now on, you will be using
your hero's unleashed powers.

816
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,890
You need to eliminate the
'Running Man' members' name tags.

817
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,010
- Only 'Running Man' members?
- Yes.

818
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,290
Even if the hero's name tag is
eliminated, they can't be ousted.

819
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,590
And they can't eliminate
any name tags, either.

820
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,830
This is important,
the other teams' name tag

821
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,090
can only be ousted by
'Running Man' members.

822
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,230
That means Song Jong Gook
can't eliminate name tags.

823
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,950
- But I can hold them down?
- Yes, you can.

824
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,890
So the one physically eliminating
it should be Ha Ha.

825
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,320
So because we are one, if my name tag
is eliminated then my hero also...

826
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,860
- Correct?
- I'll be ousted?

827
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,660
Yes, if Ha Ha is ousted,
you are also ousted.

828
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,860
When Jae Suk's name tag is eliminated,
Yeon Koung will also be ousted.

829
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,220
Do well.

830
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,030
- Okay.
- We're in the same boat.

831
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,490
The important thing is the
power you've unleashed.

832
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,490
I will tell you how you can use them.

833
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,950
There will a bamboo case
that has an orange 'R' sticker.

834
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,720
If you open it, there
will be a golden glove.

835
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,630
You need to wear that

836
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,610
and scream 'Name cloning!'

837
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,610
For example, if it's Kim Jong Kook,
slap his back with a spike.

838
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:23,010
From that moment on, Jong Kook's
name tag will be on Jae Suk's back.

839
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,010
This is hard!

840
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,150
She has to hit Jong Kook's back,
but how is she going to do that?

841
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,750
You have to yell 'name cloning!'

842
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,230
So Jong Kook's name tag
will be on Jae Suk's back.

843
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,410
You have to ask someone else
to eliminate it within a minute.

844
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,430
After the minute passes,
your name tag will return on your back.

845
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,030
For one minute...

846
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:48,060
However, if your team and
Jong Kook's team are left

847
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,860
then, you can eliminate it yourself.

848
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,750
Only if you're the last two.

849
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,220
[The power of name cloning.]

850
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,890
[Kim Yeon Koung can clone
other Running Man's name tag.]

851
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,790
[If the name tag is eliminated,
that member will be ousted.]

852
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:08,260
Find a red bamboo case
which will have a red card inside.

853
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,400
When you have found the
person you want to oust

854
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,580
blow the whistle,
yell 'temporary sending-off!'

855
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,210
you need to place the red card
on the 'Running Man' member's sock.

856
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,890
The hero will be kicked out of
the building for 15 minutes.

857
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,210
Don't place the sticker
on a hero's foot.

858
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,880
[Temporary sending-off power.]

859
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,450
[Sending off a hero by putting
a red card on Running Man's foot.]

860
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,860
Find the green case, and inside...

861
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,860
- what do you need to reboot?
- Ctrl alt delete?

862
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,090
'Ctrl, ' 'Alt, ' and 'Delete.'

863
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,180
The keys will be in three
different cases.

864
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,520
You have to find all three

865
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,580
and find the only computer that
you can use the keyboard with.

866
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,840
Find it, connect the keyboard

867
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,110
and yell 'keyboard attack,
oust Kim Jong Kook!' press enter

868
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,810
then Kim Jong Kook will be ousted.

869
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,430
- Can you type five people in a row?
- No.

870
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,750
- Just once?
- Yes, you can only oust once.

871
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,220
Only one at a time.

872
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,010
You can try and find
more keys after that.

873
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,520
[The keyboard attack.]

874
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,380
[Complete the keyboard and oust!]

875
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,410
I will explain about the
ribbon teleportation.

876
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,260
Find the bamboo case
with a purple 'R' sticker

877
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,980
and there will be a ribbon inside.

878
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,290
In a dangerous situation,
yell 'ribbon teleportation!'

879
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,260
swirl your ribbon in the air

880
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,810
there will be a shield, so you can
teleport without anyone knowing.

881
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,180
- It means that they have to act, right?
- That's right.

882
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,430
They will have to stay still
and we'll move you.

883
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:48,120
[Ribbon teleportation.]
[Teleportation by swirling the ribbon.]

884
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,630
The memory extinction power.

885
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:56,570
I think you played with this
when you were younger.

886
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,470
You know the fart bombs
that have a nasty smell.

887
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,170
Everyone who smells it
will lose their memory.

888
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,280
- I have to blast it?
- At a critical moment.

889
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,150
If the hero uses his powers
after Gary is ousted

890
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:16,720
the people around him will lose
their memory and go back to the past.

891
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,720
How many are there?
Give me two thousand bombs!

892
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,190
Whoever ousts you won't be able
to remember that they did it.

893
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,030
Gary might win this battle again!

894
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,170
He's Mr. Random Capable.
[He won the first and second.]

895
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,670
Should I be randomly capable today?

896
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,610
[He's full of energy.]
Let's be randomly capable.

897
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,980
[The memory extinction power.]
[Erase people's memory.]

898
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,110
The important thing is the
powers that you have unleashed.

899
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,780
- It's the soul exchange power.
- What is that?

900
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,920
This is a power that can
switch your name tags.

901
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,890
Ha Ha can become Joo Yup,
and Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha.

902
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,630
If you use it, then that means
Joo Yup can eliminate name tags.

903
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,600
- That's a pretty great power.
- It is great.

904
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,270
- Is there a time limit?
- It's for three minutes.

905
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,120
You can't even go to the
bathroom in three minutes.

906
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,940
You can use it three times.

907
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,750
So you can use a total
of nine minutes.

908
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,650
However, there's a spell you have
to say to activate the power.

909
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,350
This is how you do it.

910
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,630
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up, soul!

911
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,500
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up, exchange!

912
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,830
After this...

913
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,200
I'm not going to use my power!

914
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,300
- What is this?
- Don't be angry.

915
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,410
- You have to do this.
- You want me to do that?

916
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,270
You're definitely going to do it.

917
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,310
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up!

918
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,980
Be careful of your pronunciation!

919
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,550
Oh, I'm drooling.

920
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:03,020
[The soul exchange power.]
[Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha for a while.]

921
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,150
[The Battle for the Strongest, start!]

922
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,580
We need to hurry and
find the bamboo case.

923
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,460
I'm nothing without it.

924
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,610
I'm totally useless.

925
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,850
- Let's go this way.
- This is Jin Ho's hero item.

926
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,750
[The attacking keyboard.]
It's a real keyboard.

927
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,490
We need to find the computer
more than anything.

928
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,230
Keyboard attack!

929
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,730
Oust Kim Jong Kook, enter!

930
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,610
You're really fast!

931
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,430
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook.

932
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,630
I can do it with my eyes closed.
[Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook.]

933
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,550
Do we start looking for it here?

934
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,120
- We can look anywhere?
- Yes, ours is the purple sticker.

935
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,030
Purple sticker...

936
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,210
It's hard to find...

937
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,430
Oh, there's an 'R' sticker.

938
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,490
This is what it looks like.
Come, I'll show you.

939
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,380
It's Green Team's case.

940
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,060
This is easy, isn't it?

941
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,180
It's here!
Never mind, it's orange.

942
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,490
[How come it's so easy
to spot others'?]

943
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,630
Where could it be?

944
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,470
- We need to find it...
- We're doomed if we don't find any.

945
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,120
We have no strength whatsoever.

946
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,410
[Team Green and Orange met
while looking for their cases.]

947
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,860
Why are you following us?

948
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,610
I think our two teams are the weakest.

949
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,150
- Where?
- Who?

950
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,120
Us?
Why?

951
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,230
I'm really sorry, but let's look at
this in a realistic point of view.

952
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,980
If we just look at the heroes' powers

953
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,580
you're either last place
or second to last place.

954
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,290
Do you even know what my power is?

955
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,430
- What are you saying?
- Do you want some of this?

956
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:04,150
Should I put your teeth
instead of keys in here?

957
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,550
- Just be careful!
- Do you want to use your power, Jin Ho?

958
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,580
Look at me, Jin Ho.
If I punch you...

959
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,920
- you'll lose at least three teeth!
- Just show him your power!

960
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,590
If Yeon Koung spikes you...

961
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,520
your teeth and his teeth
will be switched!

962
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,860
They will be switched in the air!

963
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,030
I hope you'd survive till the end.

964
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,240
- Yeon Koung, show them your jump spike.
- How can I do it here?

965
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,840
[A long provocation]

966
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,280
[A short provocation]

967
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,050
[The provocation in perfect harmony!]

968
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,720
Then, I'll gently do it.

969
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,490
[Wait, really?]

970
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,120
[This is how she plays.]

971
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,690
[Will they be okay?]

972
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,600
Don't hit me!

973
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,500
[Scared]

974
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,310
[He's cute.]
You know what you did?

975
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,010
[I think I'll have nightmares tonight.]

976
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,240
Should I use my power?
Should I?

977
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,950
We can use our power, too!

978
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,660
Are you a referee?
[What's the whistle?]

979
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,490
[Everyone is nervous to see his whistle.]
I'll stop here.

980
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,560
His power must be really powerful.

981
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,660
If you keep doing that, we will...

982
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,790
[Shake it, shake it?]
Don't do it.

983
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,070
[They don't know each other skills,
so they're making up their movements.]

984
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,210
You know what happens if
I blow it one more time.

985
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,740
- I was really surprised!
- Me, too.

986
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,910
He's good at bluffing.

987
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,450
My nickname is Song Bluff.

988
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,620
Why did you blow it so hard?

989
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:07,130
I'm sweaty, do you see it?
[Everyone is fooled.]

990
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,090
[Song Bluff doesn't stop.]

991
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,460
[Their target is
Kwang Soo and Jin Ho.]

992
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,170
What are you doing?

993
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,090
Let's not do this.

994
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,410
[They're puzzled to see the whistle.]
Please calm down.

995
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:32,380
- What do I do?
- It's so much fun!

996
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,780
Don't do it to us!

997
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,730
We should've found at least one by now.

998
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,750
They usually hide around
desks like these.

999
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,930
[They found a green bamboo case.]

1000
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,700
You scared me!

1001
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:00,480
[In this bamboo case,
there's an 'Alt' key.]

1002
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,460
<i>'Ctrl,' 'Alt,' and 'Delete'
are separated and hidden.</i>

1003
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,950
<i>You have to find all three.</i>

1004
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,290
<i>Then find the only computer
you can connect your keyboard.</i>

1005
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,690
[They must have found it.]

1006
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,100
[They become confident
by finding the 'Alt' key.]

1007
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,370
Something might come out!

1008
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,240
Run, run away!
[Stop there!]

1009
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,140
I can't see it!

1010
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,140
- Write his name!
- I need to see it first!

1011
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,180
[We don't know what it is,
but it's scary.]

1012
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,120
[Good riddance!]

1013
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,720
[After finding the 'Alt',
they feel they've all but won.]

1014
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:50,620
Look, it's a golden color.
That's for the 'Ctrl' key.

1015
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,300
[He puts the 'Alt' key in its place.]

1016
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,700
What's that?
This is amazing!

1017
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,440
I think it happens
every time you put a key.

1018
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,110
Two more left!

1019
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,810
Are we in a mysterious world?

1020
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,250
I found the red case!

1021
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,090
- Wow, amazing!
- It's the red one.

1022
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,620
This is ours!

1023
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,490
It's awesome!

1024
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,760
[Inside, there're red cards.]

1025
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,000
What do we do now?

1026
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,330
We need to find it quickly.

1027
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,040
- Did you find it?
- Yes, I did!

1028
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,810
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung find the case.]

1029
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,210
- What's that?
- Let's go.

1030
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,420
They're all dead!

1031
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,620
Let's pretend we didn't find it.

1032
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,890
- All we can do it is nothing.
- Yeah, me, too.

1033
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,930
If we reveal our power,
it's too disadvantageous for us.

1034
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,770
<i>Ji Hyo... I'm serious.</i>

1035
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,170
<i>Let's just...</i>

1036
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,010
- Should we attack them?
- Attack?

1037
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,380
It's about time
anyone should be ousted.

1038
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,320
[We need to do that?]

1039
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:37,490
[The spell is too corny
just to watch...]

1040
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,060
<i>I'm not going to use my power!</i>

1041
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,230
<i>[At that moment, it seemed
I didn't need the power.]</i>

1042
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,870
- Should we?
- Let's do it.

1043
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:52,040
Quickly, shake it, shake it!
Let's shake it up!

1044
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,830
Soul!

1045
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,710
[Joo Yup, this is the moment!]

1046
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,380
No...

1047
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,990
[How can I do this?]

1048
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:07,820
Shake it, shake it!
Let's shake it up!

1049
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:10,330
Exchange!
[He did it perfectly!]

1050
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,000
[Soul exchange!]

1051
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:27,180
<i>This is a power that can
switch your name tags.</i>

1052
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,910
<i>Ha Ha can become Joo Yup,
and Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha.</i>

1053
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:35,580
<i>If you use it, then that means Joo Yup
can eliminate name tags.</i>

1054
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,890
<i>- That's a pretty great power.
- It is great.</i>

1055
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,260
[Joo Yup's name tag
is on Ha Ha's back.]

1056
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,200
[And Ha Ha's name tag
is on Joo Yup's back.]

1057
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,460
[Joo Yup is reborn as Ha Ha.]

1058
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,000
<i>It remains for three minutes.</i>

1059
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,270
Don't be too aggressive.
Should I eliminate Gary?

1060
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:01,040
[The Giant Haroro is on the move!]

1061
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,880
That's too harsh...

1062
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,380
- Raphaella?
- Isn't that a girl's name?

1063
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,620
[Now, who should I attack?]

1064
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,390
Should I eliminate Jae Suk?

1065
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,860
[Their first target is Yoo Jae Suk.]

1066
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,000
- Who?
- Soo Ji found their case.

1067
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,640
Look, she has it.

1068
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,910
[This is the chance!]

1069
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,650
[Grab]

1070
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:45,280
[Yeon Koung defends in a flash!]
[The sudden attack fails!]

1071
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,020
[What's going on?]
I was just kidding!

1072
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,820
[Should I try?]
I'm sorry, my body just moves.

1073
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,260
- He wanted to see.
- You're not supposed to!

1074
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,460
[Heroes can't eliminate name tags,
but he's Ha Ha now.]

1075
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,200
- Just kidding.
- Mister, put it back!

1076
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,800
Don't joke around.

1077
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,740
- He scared me!
- Me, too!

1078
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,410
I was thinking what's going on?

1079
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:13,290
Why don't you use your power
on Kwang Soo?

1080
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,890
[His second attempt.]

1081
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,850
[What is he doing?]

1082
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,890
What's wrong with you?
[He moves in slow motion.]

1083
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,290
He's weird.

1084
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,190
He's weird.
Stop it!

1085
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,070
[Slow and naive,
Brother Turtle]

1086
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,930
- We don't have to stay here.
- Let's separate now.

1087
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,210
Don't we need to decide
on the next target?

1088
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:46,640
[They step backward
for hiding their name tags.]

1089
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,980
What are you doing?

1090
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,350
[He lured him successfully.]

1091
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:59,260
Please don't do that.
[They're alone.]

1092
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,120
[Grabs]
[He seals off the hero.]

1093
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:09,010
[Go, Giant Ha Ha!]

1094
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,460
- What is it?
- Attack Gary!

1095
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,660
[What is he doing?]

1096
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,030
[What just happened?]
He's a hero.

1097
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,120
What is he doing?
What is it?

1098
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,390
[They wouldn't know they're switched,
would they?]

1099
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,840
<i>Gary is ousted,
Gary is ousted!</i>

1100
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,890
[The other teams are agitated.]

1101
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,580
It must be Ha Ha.

1102
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,000
You mean Ha Ha ousted Gary?

1103
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,720
What do you mean I'm ousted?
No, Joo Yup did it.

1104
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,090
What is it?

1105
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:51,810
[You should have checked his name tag.]

1106
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,550
[That was his power?]

1107
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,090
I'm sorry, let me
explain the situation.

1108
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:05,240
[Suk Jin, I think it's time...]

1109
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,010
[Yes, this is the moment!]

1110
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,760
<i>Ji Suk Jin's power
is the memory extinction.</i>

1111
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,460
<i>You know the fart bombs.</i>

1112
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,830
<i>Everyone who smells it
will lose their memory.</i>

1113
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,410
<i>If the hero uses his powers
after Gary is ousted</i>

1114
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:31,890
<i>the people will lose their memory
and forget Gary was ousted.</i>

1115
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,180
[This is the moment
for the fart bombs!]

1116
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,410
The memory extinction!

1117
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,780
[Huh?
The memory extinction?]

1118
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,780
[You'll see what it is.]

1119
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,840
The memory extinction!

1120
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,600
[Whoever smells this
will loose their memory.]

1121
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,910
The smell!
It's awful!

1122
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:06,510
[What a terrible smell!]

1123
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:11,010
[Everyone is surrounded by
the odor of the fart bombs.]

1124
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:18,780
- Hello!
- How have you been?

1125
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,750
We need to be careful
because we're in a battle.

1126
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,460
- Did anything happened?
- You're sweating a lot.

1127
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,810
Where did you come from?

1128
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:34,980
- From that side.
- You're Ha Ha, right?

1129
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,050
[Wait for us...]
I thought I saw three letters.

1130
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,810
No, I'm Ha Ha.

1131
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,450
What was that?

1132
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:49,150
[Three minutes passed, and the
name tags are back to its place.]

1133
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:59,520
[Don't be too relaxed,
we have two more chances.]

1134
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,610
[Kwang Soo and Jin Ho
are still searching.]

1135
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,890
Here it is!
I found it!

1136
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,090
There are 'Alt' keys everywhere.

1137
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:16,180
It's the control key!

1138
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,460
Please, please!
I hope it's not 'Alt.'

1139
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,520
[But it's the 'Ctrl' key again.]

1140
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,950
- Jin Ho!
- Did you find it?

1141
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,780
- Jin Ho!
- Where are you?

1142
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,300
[Hope it's delete key...]

1143
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,860
[Joy to the world,
the 'delete' is come!]

1144
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,580
[They've completed
the attacking keyboard!]

1145
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,860
Wow, it's done!
[Their acting gets better.]

1146
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,210
Let's find the computer now.

1147
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:54,150
[There's only one computer
in this huge building.]

1148
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,860
- We shouldn't go to the other building.
- It's Jong Kook!

1149
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,290
[Nice to see you!]

1150
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:04,090
Where are you going?
[They make a u-turn.]

1151
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:07,550
- Where are you going?
- We're searching.

1152
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:10,320
- What are you searching?
- A computer.

1153
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,780
- I know where the computer is.
- Let's go together.

1154
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,320
- Tell us where it is.
- Don't oust us, then.

1155
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,950
- Of course not!
- Why would we oust you?

1156
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,030
You know me.

1157
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,890
Then, follow me.
I found where it is.

1158
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:32,060
I saw the computer.
Don't write my name.

1159
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,640
[They follow Jong Kook,
but what's going on?]

1160
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,750
Kwang Soo, come over here.

1161
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:42,660
- Open the door.
- It's here?

1162
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:46,520
On your left.
[There it is!]

1163
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,350
How come we couldn't find it?

1164
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,030
I told you!

1165
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:54,340
- Connect the keyboard.
- Don't force him.

1166
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,490
- Don't push me.
- Sit down.

1167
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,950
I'm only going to watch him.

1168
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,460
- People treated us unfairly.
- Just connect it first.

1169
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,550
Let us boss around others.

1170
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,890
[When they don't listen,
he starts threatening them.]

1171
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,350
- Do you want to boss around?
- I'm untying my keyboard.

1172
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:16,460
I'm un... untying it!

1173
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,240
Hurry up and connect the keyboard!

1174
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,580
Hold him tight.
[I've never been in front of a tiger.]

1175
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,090
Why are you shaking?

1176
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:33,580
How can you be actually scared?
He's not even acting!

1177
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,350
What do you think is faster?
You writing my name, or me eliminate him.

1178
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:40,210
[What should I do?]

1179
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,950
I feel much better
sitting at the computer.

1180
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,950
You're not sweating any more!

1181
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:51,830
- He's just practicing.
- I'll eliminate his name tag!

1182
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:57,030
- He's not that fast.
- I'll rip this tag when you type 'Kim.'

1183
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:02,240
This is it.
[Ha]

1184
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,150
I think we should start using the item.

1185
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,080
Wear your glove.
Shout the spell here.

1186
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,890
- What was it?
- 'Name cloning!'

1187
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,920
<i>After shouting it</i>

1188
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,950
<i>for example, if it's Kim Jong Kook,
slap his back with a spike.</i>

1189
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:26,980
<i>From that moment on, Jong Kook's
name tag will be on Jae Suk's back.</i>

1190
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:32,060
<i>You have to ask someone else
to eliminate it within a minute.</i>

1191
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:36,860
<i>After the minute passes, your name
tag will return on your back.</i>

1192
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,410
<i>Within a minute...</i>

1193
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:42,380
[Who will be the one
to feel Yeon Koung's spike?]

1194
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,210
Loud?

1195
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,860
'Name cloning!'

1196
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,620
[Now she needs to slap someone
to clone their name tags.]

1197
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,550
[The two teams are allied.]
I think someone has 'Reflection.'

1198
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,610
I think so, too.
[There're people near here.]

1199
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,840
I think someone has
the reflection power.

1200
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,960
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
were hiding at the door.]

1201
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,210
[The two teams attack them
since they outnumber the two.]

1202
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,610
[Ha Ha bravely approaches.]

1203
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,920
[This is the moment!]

1204
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,690
[Volleyball spike!]

1205
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:34,580
[Yoo Jae Suk has Ha Ha's name tag.]

1206
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,290
[They have one minute!]
Eliminate me!

1207
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,860
Eliminate me now!

1208
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,370
[Ha Ha and Joo Yup
don't know what's going on.]

1209
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:48,260
Are you sure?

1210
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,950
- Hurry up and rip it off!
- You're sure?

1211
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:55,250
[The name cloning worked!]

1212
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,920
What's your power?

1213
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,920
It worked!
[What just happened?]

1214
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,290
- Run, run!
- Wait.

1215
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:11,430
- What is it?
- You're ousted.

1216
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:12,780
What?

1217
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,460
What was that?

1218
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,410
<i>Ha Ha is ousted.</i>

1219
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:20,520
[That's my hero's power.]
What is that?

1220
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,180
- When I slap your back...
- Did you slap me?

1221
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:29,480
Thank you for your hard work,
Super Power.

1222
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,030
It's full of betrayal.

1223
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,410
[Ha Ha is ousted.]
What?

1224
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,350
Well, you have less choices now.

1225
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:45,030
Then I'll write Gary's name.
Let's work together.

1226
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:48,860
- Don't betray us!
- Don't you know me?

1227
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,320
I'll write Gary's name for sure.

1228
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,140
[He wrote 'Ga' this time.]

1229
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,830
[At that moment, Gary is...]

1230
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,830
[stopped by Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.]
Temporary sending-off.

1231
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,680
- What is it?
- Sending-off!

1232
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,850
[Lift]

1233
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,720
[If they place the red card
on the Running Man member's sock]

1234
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,230
[the hero will be
kicked out for 15 minutes.]

1235
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,460
Run away!

1236
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,300
- No!
- I took off his shoe!

1237
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,350
[Jong Kook put
the red card on his foot!]

1238
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,350
[Suk Jin has been sent off.]
I had no choice.

1239
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,810
What just happened?

1240
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:38,820
You followed us
thinking we don't have any items.

1241
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:42,640
It's fine.
You need to oust me, Ji Hyo.

1242
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,590
Here, Ji Hyo.
Eliminate me!

1243
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,010
[I can be resurrected
at a cost of fart.]

1244
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:56,460
Our power is to send off your hero.

1245
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,690
[Huh?]
[Wait a second...]

1246
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:05,630
Your hero is out of the building.
He can't come back for 15 minutes.

1247
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,090
- Where is he?
- He'll be outside.

1248
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,520
[He realized the situation.]
Wait!

1249
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,550
Where did my hero go?

1250
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,660
No!

1251
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,180
No!
[Gary is ousted.]

1252
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,720
Ji Suk Jin!

1253
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:29,260
I'm so sorry, Gary.
[I want to smell the fart...]

1254
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,180
<i>Gary is ousted.</i>

1255
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:38,110
It's because we've been
facing each other.

1256
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:41,290
We've kept our pose for a while now!

1257
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:45,980
[This time, he wrote 'Yoo.]

1258
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:49,630
Now, we've reached Yoo.

1259
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,550
- Okay, I'll write it this time.
- Really?

1260
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,860
- Who are the survivors?
- Ji Hyo's team and Jae Suk's...

1261
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,350
What's going on here?

1262
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:08,120
[As soon as he enters the room,
they start threatening them.]

1263
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,090
[Yoo Jae]
Don't provoke me!

1264
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,150
Calm down.

1265
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:16,810
- I'm going to type 'S!'
- Why us?

1266
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,450
- It's either Ji Hyo or Jae Suk...
- But you can't type here.

1267
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:26,920
Jin Ho, you need to escape.

1268
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,220
Yes, Jong Kook.

1269
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,780
If you can't escape,
I'll eliminate his name tag!

1270
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:37,210
What situation is this?
[I want to go home!]

1271
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,630
Show your will to escape, at least.

1272
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,860
Who orders that around?

1273
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,150
Wait, both of you're afraid
if I'm going to write your name.

1274
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,950
I'll write Ji Hyo's name.
Then the three teams will be left.

1275
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,520
[They've come to a conclusion.]
[Song Ji]

1276
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,410
Should I really eliminate her?

1277
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:58,690
We're gathered here.
What else can you do?

1278
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:02,060
[I'm sorry.]
I'll act if there's no announcement.

1279
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,620
- I'm serious.
- I can't give up on you.

1280
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:09,030
[Jin Ho, look at my tongue.]

1281
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,840
[Do you want me to write Kkuk's name?]

1282
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,150
[Kim\Jo]

1283
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:23,510
[He was going to write
Kim Jong Kook quickly.]

1284
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,750
[He keeps making typos.]
What are you doing?

1285
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,260
Wait, wait!

1286
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,490
[Song Ji Hyo]
[He goes back to Ji Hyo's name.]

1287
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:37,230
- I saw you typed my name.
- Just to make it fun.

1288
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,120
Just kidding!

1289
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,810
Why are you so bad at typing?

1290
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,410
[Former Professional gamer
makes so many typos.]

1291
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,810
Because it's not my keyboard.

1292
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:49,670
How many times did you practice?

1293
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,690
You wrote it with your
eyes closed before!

1294
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,900
- Keep your promise, Jong Kook!
- Of course!

1295
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,660
She's going to be ousted!

1296
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:02,090
Keyboard attack!

1297
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,220
[He presses the enter key.]

1298
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,180
Keyboard attack,
oust Song Ji Hyo!

1299
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:17,560
[Oust Song Ji Hyo!]

1300
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:23,690
<i>Song Ji Hyo is ousted.</i>

1301
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,630
Lee Kwang Soo...

1302
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,580
- Is this how it is?
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1303
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,010
[This is a scary place.]

1304
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,230
[Only three teams are left.]

1305
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:45,580
- We're the only teams.
- Oh, really?

1306
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,920
The survivors are all here.

1307
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:54,950
Let's just separate.

1308
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:58,570
[Jae Suk, you know what I mean?]

1309
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,350
Kwang Soo, did you
just look at Jae Suk?

1310
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,320
I caught him!
[Launch the plan!]

1311
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,430
[Seize the tiger!]

1312
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,180
Hurry up, Yeon Koung!

1313
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:23,860
[Yeon Koung was about to spike Kkuk...]

1314
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:27,180
Ribbon teleportation!

1315
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,900
[They can teleport
when she swirls the ribbon.]

1316
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:41,090
It was really close!

1317
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,630
I knew it.

1318
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:49,060
[Thanks to Soo Ji, he survived,
but they attacked me together?]

1319
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,720
[Kwang Goo and Jin Ho
are searching for the keys again.]

1320
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,630
[They found 'Alt' key before.]

1321
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,760
[Where are you, Ctrl, Del?]

1322
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,350
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
help them, too.]

1323
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,090
[The only way to oust Kkuk.]

1324
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,840
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
find the green case.]

1325
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:17,440
[Now... how should I attack them?]

1326
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,010
[Please, please, please.]

1327
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,320
- Jin Ho!
- Did you find it?

1328
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,780
[They acquire the Ctrl' key!]

1329
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:34,150
[Go that way!]

1330
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,890
[Thanks to Jae Suk and Yeon Koung,
they found the 'Del' key.]

1331
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,750
- Keep your promise.
- Don't worry.

1332
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,890
[They made another attacking keyboard.]

1333
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:52,520
[Now, go straight to the computer!]

1334
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:59,320
I think they're trying to oust us
by making another keyboard.

1335
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:04,060
Let's just go back
to the room with the computer.

1336
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,780
It should be around here.

1337
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,670
[He found it.]
There's no one!

1338
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,480
- Why did they lock it?
- Why?

1339
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,290
Are you trying to write my name?

1340
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,550
[Open the door!]

1341
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:34,180
[Oust Kim Jong Kook.]
Did you write it?

1342
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,830
[I'm on my way to eliminate you.]

1343
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:41,720
If you write my name,
Jong Kook will win this battle.

1344
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:47,230
- One of the teams will be left.
- Yes, let's just spend the night.

1345
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,610
One will be eliminated eventually.

1346
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,380
I don't have to go home.
I have nothing to do tomorrow.

1347
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,810
[Just fight each other.]

1348
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:01,510
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
changed their mind.]

1349
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,410
They locked the door.

1350
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,950
They're waiting for you to eliminate me.
Then, they just write your name.

1351
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:13,380
- Is that so?
- Yes, they locked the door.

1352
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:22,660
- Are they fighting?
- I don't hear any sound.

1353
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,610
Maybe they already left.

1354
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,660
If they fight somewhere,
one team will remain.

1355
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,640
Then, they will announce the result.

1356
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:34,680
- I need to go to bathroom.
- No! Just pee here.

1357
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,320
[Use that.]
[An empty water bottle]

1358
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:42,180
[Quiet]

1359
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,160
- Just take a peek.
- No!

1360

1373
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,840

01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,260

[Kwang Soo runs
straight to the washroom.]

1385
