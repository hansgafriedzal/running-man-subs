[lost their memory together.]

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,900
Why am I here?

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,590
They sent a nymph from above.

40
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,520
Who are you?

41
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,730
[Unrecognizable faces]

42
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,120
[There are suspicious
objects laying around.]

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,570
- What's that!
- Don't come any closer!

44
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,420
- Don't come closer!
- What are you doing?

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,710
[What happened here?]

46
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,520
- What's happening?
- What?

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,820
I can't remember anything!

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,750
[That's a little too much...]

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm the police!

50
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,620
[The objects are the only clue]

51
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,690
[to find out who they are.]

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,120
[Meanwhile...]

53
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,930
[The same thing happened next door.]

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,500

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,730
[Jang Yoon Joo]

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,180
[Handcuffs?]

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,950
[And a police badge?]

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,330
[I don't remember anything...]

59
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,810
[There's someone else coming
out from a warehouse...]

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,880
[Jung Man Sik]

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,050
[He also does not remember anything.]

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,900
[And then...]

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,240
[A man who hasn't woken up yet...]

64
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,840
[Smoky air...]

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,530
[An unfamiliar office...]

66
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,210
[Where is this place?]

67
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,640
[A police badge...]

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,070
[What does this have to do with me?]

69
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,930
[Hwang Jung Min]

70
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,750
We need to act, so don't say anything!

71
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,320
- There's someone here!
- Who?

72
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,120
[It's already chaotic,
who else is here?]

73
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,420
Please untie me!

74
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,220
Who is it?

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
What's Jang Yoon Joo doing here?

76
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,750
[Everyone's sensitive
due to memory loss.]

77
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,530
How have you been, Yoon Joo?

78
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,350
[There's more!]
Congratulations on your wedding!

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,320
[Man Sik is here as well!]

80
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,580
How did you get here, Man Sik?

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,700
[They lost their memory but
are happy to see each other.]

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,330
[Wow!]

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,530
[The brother's visit.]

84
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,670
[What's with him?]

85
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,820
- Bring it on!
- Bring it on!

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,630
- Bring what?
- Bring it on!

87
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,380
You guys bring it on!

88
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,140
Why is everyone wearing black?

89
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,810
[Everyone who has lost their
memory is in one place.]

90
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,670
Where are you going?

91
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,380
[Giraffe's echo from faraway.]

92
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,720
Kwang Soo, you'll still be in it!
The cameraman can get you.

93
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,240
[Then, that's okay.]
Do you have to do this?

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,720
Wait, am I the police?

95
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,030
I have handcuffs, too.

96
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,320
[There are only objects to tell
them who they might be.]

97
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,240
This is the 'Find Your Identity Race.'

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,520
Between the 10 people

99
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,110
there's a mix of police and Mafias.

100
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,210
[The Mafias and police are mixed!]

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
[A few hours ago]

102
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,750
[There was a large-scale plan
to arrest a Mafia family.]

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,520
[However...]

104
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,870
[That's how they all
lost their memory.]

105
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,600
Find your identity with the hints

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,330
and if you are certain
that you are the police

107
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,130
You have to arrest the Mafia and stop them
from smuggling gold at the final mission.

108
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,720
If you are certain
that you're the Mafia

109
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,780
you need to avoid the police and
smuggle the gold to your boss.

110
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,840
What do we do with someone
that already looks like the Mafia?

111
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,050
[Huh? Me?]

112
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,120
He looks like the Mafia.

113
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,920
Then, how about the detective finds
the gold and gives it to the Mafia?

114
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,420
[His role in the movie 'The Unjust.']

115
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,180
Oh my god!

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,830
What are you going to choose?

117
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,040
Yoon Joo keeps asking me what I am.

118
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,410
[Just pick whichever you want.]

119
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,340
[The objects can be hints.]

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,720
I don't think the handcuffs necessarily
mean you're the police.

121
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,620
I had both the handcuffs and the badge.

122
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
- You're the police.
- You're the police.

123
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,410
You're the Mafia!

124
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,720
[Did the police wrap the
Mafia with duct tape?]

125
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,130
You were just sleeping.

126
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,160
You're just a duct tape.

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,570
He's so funny!

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,140
My hair was being pulled by Ji Hyo,
maybe it was before the arrest.

129
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,410
Right?

130
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,820
Man Sik said Gary looks like a husband
who was caught gambling.

131
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,120
[You went gambling?]
[Sorry...]

132
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,450
He probably lost the
deed to house gambling.

133
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,670
That's right!

134
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,890
If you get caught, you die.

135
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,320
[Find Your Identity Race, starts!]

136
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,440
[Ten people lost
their memory within seconds.]

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,500
[Am I police? Or the Mafia?]

138
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,980
[Find your identity and
complete the final mission!]

139
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
[Find Your Identity Race.]

140
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,610
[They've split off into two cars
based on their assumptions.]

141
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,180
So, we lost our memory

142
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,130
The Mafia just needs to
smuggle the gold and leave.

143
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,300
- Before that the police must stop them.
- We have to find our identity first.

144
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,880
The most important thing is

145
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,470
that the proportions are the same
between the Mafia and the detectives.

146
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,270
And we don't know if there are
more of Mafias or detectives, yet.

147
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,230
But usually there are more detectives.

148
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,800
There are more Mafias.

149
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,440
There are more thugs.

150
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,470
They pick thugs randomly, and you have
to take a test to become a detective.

151
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,720
[The king of logic.]
They pick thugs randomly!

152
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,900
And detectives need to take a test.

153
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,730
Nobody here knows if they're
the Mafia, or the police.

154
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,820
- We don't know yet.
- We don't know.

155
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,030
And it's a game, so it has
nothing to do with your image.

156
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,920
But I still think you're a Mafia.

157
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,500
I wish it was based on my image.

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,330
I don't want to think about it,
I wish I was the Mafia.

159
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,720
[Just then, the other car
drives up next to them.]

160
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,620
Jung Min really looks like...

161
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,020
Are you the police?

162
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,980
- Are you going on a picnic?
- Jung Min, you look like a prisoner!

163
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,220
- He's scary...
- I feel like...

164
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,120
- Oh my!
- He spat!

165
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,930
[He dominates them with
his method acting.]

166
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,820
Did you see that?

167
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,920
That's when the drunk guys says...

168
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,330
Is he your father? Huh?

169
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,580
[He attacks back
with his method acting.]

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
[Stop, criminal!]

171
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,350
[The police's chase of rage
in order to stop crime.]

172
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,580
[Driving fast and carefully is
an important skill to have.]

173
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,010
[That's why we prepared this mission.]

174
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,920
- I remember this!
- Three-wheel bicycle?

175
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,020
- It's a race!
- This is so old!

176
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,580
The first mission of the
Find Your Identity Race

177
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,790
is the chase of rage.

178
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,220
Because there is always a chase.

179
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,120
You ride the three-wheel bicycle

180
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,120
and you have to get to the finish
line avoiding the obstacles.

181
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,420
First to fifth place

182
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,670
winners' memory comes back partially.

183
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,510
- I have to win this one.
- I have to win.

184
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,010
We might never know who we are?

185
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,720
- We will never tell you.
- Really?

186
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,840
We have to live a full day
without knowing who we are?

187
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,330
With these tight clothes?

188
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,180
This tight, light blue shirt?

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,130
This keeps getting stuck in my armpits.

190
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,500
[The chase of rage track.]

191
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,620
[Pass the slope.]

192
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,750
[Cross the puddle in a U-turn zone.]

193
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,610
[A banana field]

194
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,550
[A steep, elevated road]

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,220
[A continuous S-shaped course
over a muddy road.]

196
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,090
[An automatic car wash]

197
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,530
[And lastly, a secret passage.]

198
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,330
[First race group, Jung Min, Ha Ha,
Yoon Joo, Jae Suk, and Man Sik.]

199
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,130
Isn't this unfair?
Jung Min's on the inner track...

200
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,350
- That's not important!
- Be quiet.

201
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,780
[Yoon Joo and Jung Min switch
places because of Ha Ha.]

202
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,820
You're dead now,
I'm going to drown you!

203
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,120
- We will bring you the shoes later.
- Yes!

204
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,390
I'm going to start later.

205
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,920
When they struggle up ahead,
I'll just cycle past.

206
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,130
- Ready...
- Good luck!

207
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,420
Ready, set!

208
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,700
[The chase of rage, round one!]

209
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,100
[Yoon Joo is speeding past!]

210
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,810
[The guys are struggling on the slope.]

211
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,550
- Ha Ha's short.
- He's too short.

212
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,300
[Man Sik is barely getting past.]

213
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,020
[Yoon Joo's in the lead.]

214
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,750
[Whoosh]

215
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,270
[Yoon Joo and Ha Ha
enter the U-course.]

216
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,260
[Whoosh, whoosh]

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,580
[They are all fighting
for third place.]

218
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,270
Jung Min, push Jae Suk away!

219
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,740
[You want me to push Jae Suk?]

220
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,580
[Splash]

221
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,420
[Did I do a good job?]

222
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,300
Fine!

223
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,640
[Run, run]

224
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,980
[Stop, there!]

225
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,610
[An unexpected triple-axel
on the banana field.]

226
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,300
[Jung Min is ready to
attack the leads.]

227
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,370
Why... why?

228
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,440
What are you doing?

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,340
Why me?

230
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,470
- He's a Mafia!
- Mafia!

231
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,810
[Go away!]

232
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,550
What are you doing!

233
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,070
It fits him so well.

234
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,300
[Within five minutes, he
became the king of cheating.]

235
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,320
It's so natural!

236
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,520
[There's no way he's a cop.]

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,780
[Run, run]

238
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,580
[Why is he here?]

239
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,170
[I don't know anymore.]

240
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,140
[Don't speed going downhill.]

241
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,380
They have nothing to do with victory.

242
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,900
- They look like they're having fun.
- It looks fun!

243
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,630
[Bring it on!]

244
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,670
[He moves their bike in the meantime.]

245
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,200
[Don't go without us!]

246
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,740
[A forceful banana pack for his skin.]

247
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,380
[Yoon Joo's already heading for
the car wash while they fight.]

248
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,050
[Dolphin scream]

249
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,390
[She arrives at the last
course after the car wash.]

250
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,030
[Man Sik arrives at the car wash, too.]

251
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,230
What is this?

252
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,730
It's cold!

253
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,270
[Somewhat miserable]

254
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,640
Man Sik, hurry!

255
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,710
Let's go down together!

256
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,820
Are you okay?

257
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,220
[The car wash stole his hair...
it's a man's dignity!]

258
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Hurry up!

259
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,120
Man Sik, hurry!

260
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,220
His father's here.

261
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,720
[Man Sik went in, and
out comes his father!]

262
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,460
Where did he go?

263
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,320
[Struggle, struggle]

264
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,340
[Yoon Joo and Man Sik
finally completed the race.]

265
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,720
[First place, Yoon Joo.]

266
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,840
Did you fall?

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,150
[Second place, Man Sik.]

268
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,020
The car wash.

269
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,850
Are you okay?

270
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,490
[Do I look okay?]

271
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,160
Don't come closer, please.

272
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,420
You told him to hold me down, first!

273
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,570
[I've warmed up, I'm ready
for the next round.]

274
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,180
[Consolation race, Jung Min, Ha Ha,
Suk Jin, Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Gary.]

275
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,120
[Round two, Ji Hyo 1st
place, Jong Kook 2nd place.]

276
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,380
- Why am I here?
- They are dirty players.

277
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,450
[Their name tags are muddy.]

278
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,120
We haven't eve begun yet!

279
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,390
- They're so dirty!
- I've never seen actors do this!

280
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,820
[The number one cheating candidate.]

281
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Are there any rules, anyway?

282
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,490
- Well one person's going to win...
- It's going to end somehow!

283
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,420
Two people get to go to the finals.

284
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,020
Go ahead, first.

285
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,770
Ready! Gary, move back...

286
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,640
- Go back.
- I'm so nervous.

287
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,320
We're starting!

288
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,520
[They all cheated at the same time.]

289
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,410
[It's too perfect as
if they'd planned it.]

290
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,530
No one can go! No one!

291
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,040
It'll never end!

292
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,070
Just then, Jung Min speeds ahead!

293
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,600
[Kick]

294
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,780
[Jung Min goes bare feet.]

295
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,550
[But Jae Suk's in the lead in a flash.]

296
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,270
[Where are you going!]

297
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,100
[He holds his bike and walks.]

298
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,500
[Ha Ha whooshes past
without getting caught.]

299
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,350
Catch Ha Ha! Hurry, catch him!

300
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,750
[Jung Min chases him with bare feet!]

301
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,240
[Come here!]

302
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,380
Look, he's doing it again!

303
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,700
He's a troublemaker, that boy!

304
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,870
[Dive]

305
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,270
Grab Jae Suk!

306
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,710
[Dive]

307
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,840
Fine, be like that!

308
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,120
Grab Ha Ha!

309
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,640
You have to catch Ha Ha!

310
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,530
[Push, push]

311
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,530
[Splash]

312
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,180
They're starting the neverending game.

313
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,810
[The neverending war of cheating.]

314
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,070
[Ha Ha and Gary take this
opportunity to speed ahead!]

315
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,550
[Jung Min's bicycle!]

316
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,210
He's miming!

317
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,730
[He's miming a three-wheel bicycle.]

318
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,410
[Ha Ha's already at the see-saw.]

319
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,070
[He jumps down
the see-saw by himself.]

320
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,930
There's one more left!

321
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,730
[First place, Ha Ha]

322
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,120
[The neverending fight
for second place.]

323
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,580
[Hwang Jung Min is angry!]

324
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,580
[I want to go forward!]

325
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,700
[Bring it on!]

326
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,020
[He was a really scary person...]

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,170
[Jae Suk is in the lead
for second place.]

328
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,050
[Where are you going!]

329
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,620
Take his bike!

330
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,810
[Where are you going!]

331
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,980
Please!

332
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,960
Please, my butt!

333
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,390
He's such a dirty player.

334
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,030
Let's all start at the same time.

335
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,130
- Wait.
- Bring your bike!

336
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,960
My bike is here.

337
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,530
[While Jae Suk steals his
bike back from Kwang Soo]

338
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,050
[Gary and Jung Min race ahead.]

339
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,560
[The last round of a
crazy cheating war.]

340
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,530
[Jae Suk and Suk Jin join in.]

341
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,490
[Just then!]

342
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,520
Go down!

343
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,590
[Kwang Soo locks Gary
and Jung Min's bikes.]

344
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,430
[Right then, Jae Suk
brushes past them!]

345
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,200
[He wins an advantage
from a difficult situation.]

346
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,830
What is this?
[Second place, Jae Suk]

347
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,430
[He's more happy than
an actual victory.]

348
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,390
I finally got away from this hell!

349
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,920
[Ha Ha and Jae Suk get to the finals.]

350
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,490
[Suk Jin, Gary, Kwang Soo,
and Jung Min fail.]

351
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,720
[At least we don't have
to play this anymore!]

352
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,720
[It's not over, I have a lot of
cheating skills left to show...]

353
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,630
[Finals, Man Sik, Yoon Joo, Ji Hyo,
Ha Ha, Jong Kook, Jae Suk.]

354
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,820
- He's the king of cheating!
- He really is.

355
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,980
He won because you grabbed our bikes!

356
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,360
Jae Suk, I kind of helped...

357
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,850
There were all sorts
of cheating involved.

358
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,620
Only five people get the hints, right?

359
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,520
- Only the last person...
- Just don't be the last one!

360
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,660
Everyone else is an enemy except me.

361
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,360
[Finals, starts!]

362
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
[Yoon Joo and Man Sik are in the lead.]

363
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,320
Just don't be last!

364
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,140
Yoon Joo's going!

365
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,180
[Just then, Ji Hyo speeds past.]

366
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,610
[The expert of three-wheeled bicycles.]

367
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,730
- Catch her!
- It's because she rides bikes often.

368
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,520
[Ji Hyo and Yoon Joo are too fast.]

369
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,420
[But Man Sik is easy to deal with.]

370
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,760
[The last spurt of the lower ranks.]

371
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,230
You have to catch Man Sik!

372
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,020
- Don't come!
- I have to catch you!

373
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,930
Don't come!

374
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,360
[Stop there!]

375
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,980
[Ji Hyo is still in the lead.]

376
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,490
[Man Sik lost all his energy.]

377
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,390
[Tiredly falls]

378
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,890
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook
take this chance.]

379
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,560
[The side effect of his tight shirt.]

380
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,390
It's so cold!

381
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,160
[First place Ji Hyo and second place
Yoon Joo enter the car wash.]

382
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,990
[Unique ladies, the power
of the lead group.]

383
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,590
[If they both get on the see-saw together,
they'll at least get second place.]

384
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,990
[The rest of them all
enter at the same time.]

385
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,220
Just wait a little bit!

386
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,400
Let's go!

387
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,230
[The ladies enter the
final course together.]

388
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,380
[First place Ji Hyo,
second place Yoon Joo.]

389
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
[Third and fourth are
Jae Suk and Jong Kook.]

390
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,630
Who's third place?

391
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,020
[Third place Jae Suk,
fourth place Jong Kook.]

392
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,230
This is so meaningless!

393
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,660
[Now the only thing left is the loser.]

394
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,230
I feel like I'm dragging someone.

395
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,590
[Bingo]

396
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,660
[Man Sik's father is back.]

397
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,530
He ages on the way back.

398
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,290
[The loser doesn't get any hints.]

399
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,320
Should I run faster?

400
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,890
This guy... you're making me sorry!

401
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,790
What are you doing?

402
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,030
I'm really embarrassed, but...

403
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,560
[What should I do...]

404
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,090
[I can't give up...]

405
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,920
- Your hand...
- No...

406
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,450
I don't think I'll ever
hold hands with you.

407
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,120
We could be colleagues!

408
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,220
[Slide]

409
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,360
[Now's the time!]

410
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,330
[The final spurt!]

411
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,030
[Who will be the loser]

412
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,790
[that doesn't get the
hint after all this?]

413
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,820
[Fifth place, Ha Ha]

414
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,990
[Man Sik gets last place.]

415
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
[Father...]

416
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,000
You must be hurt...

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,460
Man Sik... just sit there.
Don't get up.

418
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,400
[I'm sorry.]

419
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,520
You match with the bike!
It's so fitting!

420
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,430
The color is the same!

421
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,480
I'll just be here, casually...

422
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,480
[Ji Hyo got first place
and regained three memories.]

423
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,260
[Handcuffing someone's hand]

424
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,430
[A police hat, and police car]

425
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,260
[Two hands that opened a
cabinet with gloves on.]

426
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,820
[Then, that means...]

427
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,560
[Yoon Joo regains two memories.]

428
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,300
[Two hands that were handcuffed]

429
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,620
[Two hands holding a
treasure with gloves.]

430
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,930
[My identity is...]

431
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,710
[Jae Suk also regains
two memories.]

432
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,120
[A call from Boss]

433
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,560
[A wanted poster]

434
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,420
[Then am I...]

435
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
[Jong Kook only regains one memory.]

436
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,060
[A text message by the
Boss, giving an order.]

437
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,840
[Then my identity is...]

438
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,940
[And Ha Ha regains one memory!]

439
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,260
[A secret ledger
with transaction information]

440
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,120
[Then I am...]

441
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,330
[There's always a line you
mustn't cross at a crime scene!]

442
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,230
[The line only police can cross.]

443
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,030
[Do not cross - Police Line]

444
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:44,260
[That's why we've prepared
the Blockbuster Police line!]

445
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,820
This is the second mission.

446
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,630
This is an important
mission for cops.

447
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,530
Cross the police line!

448
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,420
There are two people in
each police line zone.

449
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,020
You have to start behind the line

450
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:09,830
and when I whistle, you need to cross
the line and take out the flag.

451
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,960
So one person will fail each time.

452
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,600
It's really cruel!

453
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,290
I already had a taste of hell,
this is even more hellish.

454
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,280
It's only going to end
when someone collapses.

455
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,730
Different from the previous mission

456
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,990
You have a chance of
calling a secret agent.

457
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,420
- This is nice.
- You can ask them questions.

458
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,890
That's amazing!

459
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:41,220
Man Sik said that even if his team wins,
he doesn't want to be the protagonist.

460
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,790
- Why?
- He always has a supporting role.

461
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,170
It doesn't work that way here.

462
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,290
- You can be the protagonist today.
- No, no...

463
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,170
You might be the protagonist today.

464
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,720
- You were the protagonist earlier!
- In reverse...

465
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,690
Whoever stands beside me
can be the protagonist.

466
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,920
[A kingmaker for the true protagonist.]

467
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
He's so cool.

468
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,030
It'll be hard for Man Sik...
it's a little tight.

469
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,090
What about you?

470
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,860
You're both the same.

471
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,600
[Cross the police line, round one.]

472
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,420
So we go in pairs?

473
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,820
[Who will be the first one to fail?]

474
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,320
I'll show you what cheating is...

475
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,920
[They're all worried
they'll be cheated.]

476
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,420
Nice, nice!

477
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,520
Ready, set!

478
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,420
[My secret identity...]

479
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,390
[I will find the hint here!]

480
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,590
[Scream!]

481
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,130
[Automatic screams as
soon as they start.]

482
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,360
[Everyone's crawling?]

483
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,810
[They all crawl together...]

484
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,290
[Yoon Joo who still hasn't
gotten used to the cheating]

485
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,460
[Finally starts crawling.]

486
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,760
[Un-decipherable]

487
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,620
[Welcome, cheaters]

488
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,660
[Gary and Man Sik pass]

489
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,230
[Where are you going!]

490
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,030
[Jung Min uses addition
cheating skills.]

491
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,290
[Jung Min got the last flag!]

492
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,710
It's hurts so much!

493
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,220
[Yoon Joo is last.]

494
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,840
I was hit six times!

495
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,690
I actually tried crossing the line...

496
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,760
[I've never seen such dirty players...]

497
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,260
Everyone crawled...

498
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,750
Jang Yoon Joo is eliminated.

499
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,460
What were you thinking?

500
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,890
[He's the king of cheaters.]

501
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,990
I'm with Man Sik,
so it gets narrow at the end!

502
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,990
We can't go out at the same time!

503
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,290
We were stuck!

504
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,230
Yoon Joo, please go to the side.

505
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,120
Yoon Joo, it's okay!

506
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,990
Don't talk to me!

507
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,690
- Don't crawl!
- I crossed normally!

508
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,990
You can't just let everyone pass!

509
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,860
Only one has to drop!

510
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,230
Don't leave him alone!

511
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,620
- What are you doing?
- Let's make a pair!

512
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,020
- Where are you going to go?
- This way...

513
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,330
- There are three people here!
- Do you want to fail with me?

514
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,370
- I see.
- Don't crawl!

515
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,430
- This side might be easy.
- Yes, let's cross it quickly.

516
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,430
Let's cooperate!

517
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,310
- You know that, right?
- I know.

518
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,830
We'll help each other.

519
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,590
It's not my fault if you get hurt!

520
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,990
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

521
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,990
[They're still intense over here.]

522
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,950
[Cross the police line,
second round starts!]

523
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,990
[They're violently entering]

524
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,990
[as if they're doing
a field inspection.]

525
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,990
It hurts!

526
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,990
It's tight!

527
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,390
[Everyone is screaming
in the overpopulated side.]

528
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,870
[It's easier for Jung Min.]

529
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,130
[Who created this game?]

530
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,350
[It's still very hard for him.]

531
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,860
[What an advantage
to stand next to Big-nose!]

532
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,720
[Jong Kook and Jung Min pass first.]

533
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,190
[Come on, Big-nose!]

534
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,320
[Total wreck]

535
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,830
[Two flags for Suk Jin, Gary,
and Kwang Soo!]

536
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,480
[I want to get the flag!]

537
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,330
[I want to find out my identity!]

538
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,090
[Three cornered battle for the flag]
[Who's going to win?]

539
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,730
[Kwang Soo and Gary
acquired the flags!]

540
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,430
[Oh, my brother...]
Suk Jin, come here!

541
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,730
This isn't even funny!

542
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,830
- We came together...
- In the same car...

543
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,320
Did you block Jung Min?

544
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,710
I couldn't because he
might have elbowed me.

545
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,830
He doesn't look back.

546
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,910
He actually hits me
when we film movies.

547
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,150
And that hurts a lot!

548
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,420
- Let's go through together.
- Okay, okay.

549
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,890
[For the third round, he proposes
an alliance with Ha Ha.]

550
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,930
There are three people
who didn't get any hints.

551
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,630
[It'll be easy again.]

552
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,930
[Cross the Police Line!
The third round starts!]

553
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,890
[Jung Min goes first
and Ha Ha follows?]

554
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,460
[Giraffe crawls again.]
Don't crawl!

555
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,290
[Where are you going, Giraffe?]

556
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,020
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook
pass at the same time.]

557
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,620
[Right before Giraffe goes out,
he gets caught!]

558
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,090
[Jung Min and Ha Ha...]

559
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,890
[Headlock?]

560
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,330
[I thought they put arms
around each other...]

561
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,030
[In the meantime, Ji Hyo passes.]

562
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,440
We shouldn't fight
with each other!

563
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,460
Both of you can survive!

564
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,020
What are they going to do?

565
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,330
[Since their alliance broke,
he doesn't want to let him go.]

566
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,330
Let me go!

567
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,220
There's only one flag!

568
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,030
Hook him with your legs!

569
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,220
[Will Jung Min end up
losing because of Ha Ha?]

570
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,790
[I can't let you go!]

571
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,460
[Did you think
our promise was a joke?]

572
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,130
[Brother... this isn't right...]

573
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,390
[The dirty legs...]

574
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,190
[He lost them!]

575
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,630
[My paramour is gone.
My beloved paramour is gone.]

576
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,330
[Ha Ha grabs the last flag!]

577
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,830
[I can't believe
Ha Ha tricked me.]

578
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,830
[He was careless with Ha Ha.]

579
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,690
[And Ha Ha strikes Jung Min
on the back of his head.]

580
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,530
[Why did I team up with him?]

581
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,660
- It's like a movie!
- Jung Min hgas no hint!

582
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,330
[Hwang Jung Min drops
out of the third round.]

583
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,330
We need to win two more rounds
to get a hint.

584
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,260
Jung Min and I won't
figure out our identities.

585
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,820
- I'd rather not know it.
- We'll still be able to find it.

586
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,860
[All of a sudden, music starts.]

587
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,090
[Running Man members
start dancing automatically.]

588
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,800
It's so funny!

589
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,290
[He's adopted right away.]

590
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,160
[Everyone is dancing now.]

591
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,060
[As if they're having
a party on the meadow]

592
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,780
[but they start the fight
at the sound of a whistle.]

593
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,030
[The fourth round starts
all of a sudden.]

594
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,960
That's scary!

595
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,030
[The flags are getting less,
their combat powers move up.]

596
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,330
[In a hurry]

597
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,970
[After Jong Kook and Ha Ha]

598
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,970
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
acquire a flag.]

599
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,030
Look at Ji Hyo!

600
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,910
[The police line supports me.]

601
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,590
[Ji Hyo crosses it like Agent Smith.]

602
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,530
Is it Man Sik who failed?

603
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,330
Brother Man Sik!
Where did you get caught?

604
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,830
- Man Sik!
- He's sitting on a hammock.

605
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,230
He's on vacation.

606
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,500
I just want to get some rest.

607
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,290
[Do not cross! Police Line]

608
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,430
[Ji Hyo fails at the fifth round.]
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,630
Are there anyone who'll get two hints?

610
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,490
- Jong Kook.
- Jae Suk, Jong Kook and Ha Ha?

611
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,530
[The informer can only answer
yes or no.]

612
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,130
[The information they can get
is up to the questions they ask!]

613
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,730
<i>- Hello.
- Yes, Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

614
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,630
The place that I get my pay check is...

615
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,060
the boss?

616
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:41,160
<i>The answer is... no.</i>

617
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,860
[As he hears the answer,
he remembers something.]

618
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,290
[A police badge under his feet!]

619
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,120
[Two hands that put
a wanted poster.]

620
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,460
[Answering a call
from 'the boss.']

621
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,690
[He remembers it all at once...]

622
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm sure now. I'm the police.

623
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,090
[Is he really a police man?]

624
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,590
The hint I have from before,
has the word 'task.'

625
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:24,090
Is this 'task' something illegal?

626
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,860
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

627
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,260
[As soon as he hears the answer,
he remembers...]

628
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,790
[a lead pipe and a pair of
handcuffs near him.]

629
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,260
[A message from the his boss
about his job.]

630
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,760
Through the questions I asked,
I cleared confirmed my identity.

631
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm a Mafia.

632
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,630
<i>- I'll ask a question.
- Yes.</i>

633
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,130
Am I a government worker?

634
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,660
Am I being chased by someone?

635
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,830
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

636
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:12,260
<i>You're not a government worker.</i>

637
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,060
[Ji Hyo grabbed Gary's hair.]

638
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,190
[The handcuffs under Ha Ha's feet.]

639
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,430
[The ledger that Ha Ha remembers.]

640
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,150
I'm sure...

641
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm a Mafia.

642
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,590
Mafia.

643
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,390
[Are Gary and Ha Ha really the Mafia?]

644
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,390
<i>- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Yes, hello.</i>

645
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,230
Did I...

646
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,060
do anything wrong?

647
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,660
<i>No, you didn't do anything wrong.
I'll hang up now.</i>

648
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,760
That's not what I meant. Wait!

649
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,490
[The conversation is over.]
Hey... hey!

650
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,560
[Anyway... let me gather up
the fragments of memories.]

651
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,290
[I was covered by duct tape]

652
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,300
[and I did nothing wrong...]

653
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,760
[That means...]

654
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,430
[I'm a cop?]

655
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,020
[The third mission of
Finding The Identity Race]

656
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,230
[The highlight of police tasks,
the undercover duty]

657
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,560
[Right here, right now]
What do we need to do here?

658
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,630
[a very special stakeout
will be played.]

659
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,860
[The car for the stakeout.]

660
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,290
[The hideout is in front of
a convenience store?]

661
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,930
[What secret does
this empty store have?]

662
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,950
You know, I have no idea
how to play this mission.

663
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,130
- We need to go there secretly.
- Without getting caught?

664
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,630
How is that possible?

665
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,730
From those guys?

666
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,630
How is it possible?
There are so many people.

667
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,030
It's those guys?

668
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,330
- It's impossible.
- They're living their own life.

669
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,770
Each one has a role.

670
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,560
[Is that a camera?]
They're aiming for us.

671
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,990
[Who are these men with cameras?]
How do we do this?

672
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:51,560
- Inside, we should...
- I think that's more difficult.

673
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,860
This is the last mission
that can help finding your identity.

674
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,460
[Five minutes ago...]

675
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,790
The third mission is

676
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,860
'the undercover shopping
at the convenience store.'

677
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:08,560
[No one's excited over shopping...]

678
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,290
- There's a convenience store outside.
- Yes, I saw it.

679
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,930
There are four judges with cameras
inside and outside.

680
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,310
You need to buy the appointed items
and go back to the car

681
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,830
while you avoid them.

682
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,290
We shouldn't be photographed.

683
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,530
The mission doesn't just end
when they take your picture.

684
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,690
You keep doing the mission
until you go back to the car.

685
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,090
Each photo is counted as five seconds.

686
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,130
In that case, even if
you finish the mission fast

687
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,090
the total time can be long
if they've taken a lot of pictures.

688
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,830
This time, we'll also give out
the hint to five people.

689
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,780
Two people will carry the mission
so it's one on one battle.

690
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,060
Who you're against
is very important.

691
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,660
Man Sik seems he'll be
on their camera easily.

692
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,690
Look at his face.
He looks like he's absentminded.

693
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,730
- Is it very tough for you?
- A little.

694
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:12,630
[A little tough]
[Putting on a prim air]

695
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,330
[I should have stayed home and rested.]

696
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,800
The first pair are...

697
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,530
- Kwang Soo and Yoon Joo.
- Us, together?

698
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,230
If one of us comes back,
only that person passes?

699
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,030
Yes, that'll happen.

700
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,230
I can't lock the door.

701
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,530
- Can I?
- You can't lock the door.

702
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,830

1048
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,960
The five briefcases
of gold bars in this factory.

1049
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,690
Load all five briefcases in this SUV.

1050
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:20,490
You need to move them to the hideout

1051
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,270
where the Boss is.

1052
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,060
You'll win if you succeed in doing so.

1053
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,630
Let's find them
before the police arrives.

1054
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:29,560
[Where is the briefcase?]

1055
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:34,560
Man Sik, if you get caught
in the middle of searching

1056
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,490
I'll try and earn some time.

1057
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:42,160
- Run away and look for them.
- Okay.

1058
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,260
In the end, the police
special forces will come.

1059
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,560
- Then you'll be rounded up.
- SWAT team?

1060
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,460
Before that happens,
hurry and find the briefcases.

1061
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,260
Where is it?

1062
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,730
Is the police here?

1063
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:01,130
They're not here yet, right?

1064
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:07,630
[At that moment,
the police are entering the factory]

1065
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,590
[We're here to arrest the Mafia.]

1066
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,860
The police will wear
this bell on your shoe.

1067
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:20,690
Arrest all of them and
seize the gold bars.

1068
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,960
If the police win, you'll be
awarded with the gold bars.

1069
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,660
It's been a while.

1070
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,860
They're already
carrying out their mission.

1071
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,190
Should we attach the bell?

1072
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,630
Then, they'll know where we are.

1073
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:36,390
- That's why we attach it.
- Oh, is that so?

1074
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,870
[Mafia mopping-up
operation has begun!]

1075
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,160
Why are we running all the time?
Ah, it's 'Running Man.'

1076
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,630
It's tiring!

1077
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,460
[They're here!]

1078
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:00,230
[We should move carefully.]

1079
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,860
[I think I'll suffer from
auditory hallucinations again.[

1080
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,760
[They're searching the gold bars
more discreetly.]

1081
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,260
[Looks around]

1082
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,760
What is that?

1083
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:26,090
[A briefcase with the 'R' sticker!]

1084
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:34,060
[The gold bars!]
There's another one!

1085
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:39,430
They're really heavy!
[Moreover, there're two!]

1086
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,390
[Perhaps, in here?]

1087
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,100
[Bummer]

1088
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,490
[Man Sik chose the Mafia
without a hint.]

1089
01:08:56,490 --> 01:09:01,490
[He looks like a thief.]

1090
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,660
[The briefcase of gold bars!]

1091
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,660
[And there are two again!]

1092
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,830
[Now the Mafia team
found four briefcases.]

1093
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,790
- Where are they?
- I found two here!

1094
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,390
- I found them, too.
- Did we find three?

1095
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,960
[I hear something]...

1096
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,790
Where's our car?

1097
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,030
[They decided to put
the briefcases in the car.]

1098
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,590
[The boss is impatient.]

1099
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:41,090
[Hurry up and find five briefcases
and send them to the boss!]

1100
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,460
[It's about time to find them...]

1101
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,960
- Is the trunk open?
- Yes.

1102
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,790
- Wow!
- The other way.

1103
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:57,060
I'll protect them here.

1104
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,160
- Do we need to find one more?
- Yes.

1105
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,690
[We need to find one more briefcase
then we can go to our boss.]

1106
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,990
Where were they?
Were they hidden very well?

1107
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:13,360
I was always bad at scavenger hunts
when I was young.

1108
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:17,030
I don't think it's here.

1109
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:20,290
[Chills]

1110
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,790
- Let's get out.
- Sh...

1111
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,630
[The police is near.]
Did you find anyone?

1112
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:32,960
Do you want to go to the car?

1113
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,660
[He checks the outside
and stepped out.]

1114
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,630
Jae Suk!

1115
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,560
[Catch the thief!]

1116
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,590
[Forget your colleagues.
Run for your life!]

1117
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,530
Is that Man Sik?

1118
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:01,890
[He's faster than he looks.]

1119
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,760
[Is this Jung Min?]

1120
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:11,280
[He senses the situation outside]

1121
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,560
[and chases the Mafia
at full speed!]

1122
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:21,090
[This is the true character
of a veteran detective!]

1123
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,130
[Grabs]

1124
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,760
I eliminated him!

1125
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,790
[He arrested the first Mafia!]

1126
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,690
- Man Sik!
- I almost missed him.

1127
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:42,590
He caught me in the movie
and he even caught me on 'Running Man.'

1128
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,760
He was hiding here.

1129
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,790
[You should have
chosen to be the police.]

1130
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:53,090
[But did they really chose
the right identities?]

1131
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:57,530
[Startled]

1132
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,860
[It's Blank Ji!]

1133
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,860
[She was going to
hide in the blind spot.]

1134
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,560
[Blank Ji was surprised, too!]

1135
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,790
[Yoon Joo is stuck.]

1136
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,690
Please give up and go!

1137
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,330
[The enthusiastic detective
is on the move!]

1138
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:23,650
Jung Min, don't this to me!

1139
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,590
[You were here?]

1140
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:31,090
[Jae Suk joins them.]
Oh, no! Don't do this to me!

1141
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:34,130
- Jae Suk, take care of her!
- Yoon Joo!

1142
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:36,930
Don't do this!

1143
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,630
Jae Suk...
Jung Min, look inside the car!

1144
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,930
There's someone inside the car!

1145
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,290
Suk Jin is inside the car!

1146
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,460
[Wriggle, wriggle]

1147
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,430
[Big-nose was right in front of them.]

1148
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,230
Catch him! Don't catch me!

1149
01:12:56,430 --> 01:13:00,530
[Were you waiting for me
to eliminated you?

1150
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:04,220
Suk Jin!

1151
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:07,190
[The end of the Mafia
who ratted on her colleague.]

1152
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,430
Why did you tell them?

1153
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,230
- Let's just die together.
- What are you...

1154
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:15,460
You're not supposed to hide there.

1155
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,360
Why did you tell them?
You drive me crazy!

1156
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,230
[Only three Mafia members are left!]

1157
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,990
[We just need to find
one more briefcase...]

1158
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,190
[How could we lose the police?]

1159
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,830
It might be tiring for you,
but I'll run slowly.

1160
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,430
[He caught three criminals.]
[Captain Hwang is enjoying arresting.]

1161
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,630
[Gasp]

1162
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:51,860
[Throbbing]

1163
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,860
[What was that?]

1164
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,690
[Did he find me?]

1165
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:10,630
[Ha Ha, with a guilty conscience
starts running!]

1166
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:12,360
[It worked!]

1167
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,290
[Were you there, Ha Ha?]

1168
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:20,730
[Why did he come out?]

1169
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,430
Jae Suk, Ha Ha is running!

1170
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:27,430
- I'm right here!
- Corner him!

1171
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:35,690
For my colleagues,
I need to hold out until the end!

1172
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,960
- Finish him!
- It's over!

1173
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,430
I need to drag on...

1174
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:47,390
[Ha Ha dragged on for five seconds.]
There are two left!

1175
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,330
[Smile]

1176
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,130
[He arrested four Mafias.]
[The best cop!]

1177
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:59,590
[Gary and Jong Kook
are the two survivors.]

1178
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:02,460
Stay behind me.

1179
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,850
[How can I avoid them?]

1180
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:09,360
Come over here, to the back.

1181
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,360
Come, we'll get caught
if you keep going that way.

1182
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,490
It's good.

1183
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:22,130
[He's immersed in the Mafia's role.]

1184
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:24,460
[He really wants to win today.]

1185
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,930
Oh, it's right here!

1186
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:34,590
[He found the last briefcase!]

1187
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,960
[Wait for me, Boss!]
Where's the car?

1188
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,030
Where's the car?

1189
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:45,330
[He successfully arrives at the car.]

1190
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,790
[They can go to the boss's hideout!]

1191
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,660
[Wait, Jong Kook is still...]

1192
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,500
[Should I just go or not?]

1193
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,630
- It's Jong Kook!
- Kwang Soo saw me.

1194
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:11,060
[He's finally detected!]

1195
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:15,590
Bring it on!

1196
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:19,060
[The fateful meeting
with the original.]

1197
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:23,530
He's politely asking you
to bring it on.

1198
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:27,230
- I'm not going to do it.
- Come on, Jung Min.

1199
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,930
[Blank Ji attacks.]
Wait, Ji Hyo!

1200
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,030
[The car with gold bars
leaves the site.]

1201
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,190
[Kkuk is in a
confrontational situation.]

1202
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:44,560
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

1203
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,790
[Gary, It's too late for me.]

1204
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:49,990
It's Gary!

1205
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:53,460
[Yoo Hyuk finds Gary!]
Catch him!

1206
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,390
Jong Kook!
[Where are you?]

1207
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:58,730
[I'll delay it as long as possible!]

1208
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,730
Ji Hyo!

1209
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:04,290
[Mafia Kim Jong Kook is arrested!]

1210
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,060
How is it possible?
[There's only one left.]

1211
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,430
[Gary, go to the boss!]

1212
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,260
[Jong Kook, I'll finish this!]

1213
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,230
Jae Suk, the car is moving!

1214
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:22,090
Catch him!

1215
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,160
- Did he run away with the car?
- Yes!

1216
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,060
Hurry up!

1217
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:30,830
Still, the Mafia team wins.

1218
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:32,430
In the end...

1219
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,760
[Gary gives police
the slip like that..]

1220
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,490
[and moves to the boss's hideout!]

1221
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,890
[If he delivers theses five briefcases
to their boss...]

1222
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:01,390
[This is the boss's hideout!]

1223
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:05,930
Boss!

1224
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:09,890
I brought all the gold bars, Boss.

1225
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:18,690
[The identity of the Boss]

1226
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,230
[Lee Dong Jun]

1227
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:29,160
The real boss is here!

1228
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,460
[The boss was Lee Dong Jun?]

1229
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,660
Good job!

1230
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,490
By the way, did you find
these all by yourself?

1231
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:41,990
No, I brought them at the end.

1232
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,960
But we all worked together.

1233
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,260
Is that so? That's amazing.

1234
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,660
Thank you. I admire you, Boss!

1235
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:52,390
You've won the world Taekwondo
championship three times.

1236
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,500
- Three consecutive years of winning!
- And?

1237
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,360
- That's what I know!
- That's what you know?

1238
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:03,060
- Who's he?
- The real boss is here.

1239
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:07,490
What were you doing?
You couldn't even find them!

1240
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,960
[Gary, you did it!]

1241
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,430
Where did you find it?

1242
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,360
You've worked so hard.

1243
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,530
We found them together!
[Not all six of them are Mafias.]

1244
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,330
I'll show my loyalty!

1245
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,290
Let me see...

1246
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,460
Who is this bastard?

1247
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,730
[Is Big-nose the bastard?]
He's not one of our members.

1248
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,930
That can't be true.
I worked for you today.

1249
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:42,490
- I've never seen you before.
- You must be wrong.

1250
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:45,360
I haven't seen you before.

1251
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,990
- Drag him out!
- Boss!

1252
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,730
[Big-nose is not the Mafia?]

1253
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,160
- Boss!
- Goodbye!

1254
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,530
[Suk Jin thought he's the Mafia.]

1255
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,290
[But his real identity is...]

1256
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,090
[the police!]

1257
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:10,130
Therefore, today's winning team
is the Mafia team.

1258
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,630
[Jung Min was a detective!]

1259
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:15,160
[Man Sik also chose
his identity correctly!]

1260
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,960
Jung Min ran really hard today...

1261
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:22,690
Yoon Joo's pants were provided.
She has to buy because he made a hole.

1262
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:27,860
Thank you Man Sik, who makes us laugh
even if he doesn't talk.

1263
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:33,890
Thank you for acting as the boss,
Brother Lee Dong Jun.

1264
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,990
Thank you! I'm a fan of yours!

1265
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:40,260
Today's winners are Gary and the Mafia!

1266
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:45,260
[The true actors of Korea!]
[Good luck with your movies!]

1267
