00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,870
[Everyone's dancing!]

174
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,270
[The legends' collaborated stage
finalizes the performance!]

175
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,500
[The Running Man fifth anniversary
surprise party was a success!]

176
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,500
[Both thumbs up!]

177
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,570
[The heat in the club doesn't die out.]

178
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,500
[A slightly annoying gesture.]

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,670
What are you doing?
Why you?

180
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,760
[What have you contributed...]

181
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,470
It was such an amazing night!

182
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,740
This is the first time
I've sang this song before noon.

183
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,170
[It's also their first
collaboration concert!]

184
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,180
I thought this was a dream!

185
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,640
They're the same as back then!

186
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,120
Please introduce yourselves.

187
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,750
- It's an honor!
- It's such an honor!

188
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,870
The fact that they're
all here, together.

189
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,520
How many albums have
they sold altogether?

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,600
I think it's around 20 million!

191
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
They're the one that reflect the '90s.

192
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,170
Suk Jin and I were doing
the military service together.

193
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,370
- That's right.
- We were together...

194
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,100
I trained him.

195
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,070
He was really nice to me.

196
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,640
Was he hard-working?

197
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,510
You should've gotten beaten up, back then.

198
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,430
Why?
I tried really hard.

199
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,750
[It's the first time
seeing him so obedient.]

200
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,470
Today's race is
'The Million Seller Race.'

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,470
All the guests, including Jong Kook

202
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,130
have a record of
selling millions of albums.

203
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,530
He holds the Guinness record.

204
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,400
You will be divided into teams and
collect albums during missions

205
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,030
to get a total of
ten million albums to win.

206
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,170
The total amount of the
three million sellers' highest

207
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,800
selling album number
will be your initial score.

208
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,900
[It's an advantage if they have
a higher amount of sold albums.]

209
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll announce
the Running Man team, first.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,970
Yoo Jae Suk, Gary, Song Ji Hyo
are on one team.

211
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,870
And the betrayal club is a team.

212
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,300
[Which teams will the legends go?]

213
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,200
- Kim Gun Mo!
- Come here!

214
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,370
Look at all of them!

215
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,570
Jong Kook looks so nice.

216
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,830
I just want to say something.
[He sits like a lamb.]

217
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,800
I used to accompany these
people back in the day.

218
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,970
I was the youngest one
in the waiting room!

219
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,570
More than anything,
the thing we're most curious about

220
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,070
is the number of albums they sold,
which was incredible.

221
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,600
I think Kim Gun Mo sold the most.

222
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,970
He sold the most albums!

223
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,070
- The Wrongful Encounter!
- My third album sold 2.8 million!

224
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,800
- That went on the Guinness, right?
- Yes.

225
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,900
- The sale of a single album?
- Yes.

226
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,470
- If you include the black market...
- It should be around 3.5 million!

227
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,100
You sold so many!
[Poker face]

228
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,070
- What about g.o.d?
- g.o.d.'s second album!

229
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,600
Third album, 'Lie.'

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,770
Oh, right, 'Lie!'
'No, no!'

231
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,130
It was 2.3 or 2.4 million...

232
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,700
The second, third, and fourth
album sold the most.

233
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,730
- Which album did you sell the most?
- It was either second or third...

234
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,230
- 'Love is'!
- 'December'!

235
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,600
- Did it surpass one million?
- All of Turbo's album did.

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,270
He's so at ease!

237
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,200
We couldn't pass a million for the
last album, but all the other ones did.

238
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,470
What about DJ DOC?

239
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,400
I think, 'Morphy's Law'
sold the most!

240
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,270
I think it was the third album?
It passed a little over two million.

241
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,100
- That's right.
- That's probably right.

242
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,730
What about CLON?

243
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,430
Our first album sold the most.

244
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,900
I think it was either a million
or slightly under a million...

245
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,200
While we talked about the number of
albums, his voice got a little smaller.

246
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,270
[The singers before me
were too strong...]

247
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,870
To be honest...

248
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,770
I thought, 'should I
just say 1.3 million?'

249
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,400
But I thought I would get caught...

250
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,700
So I said slightly under a million.

251
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,180
- He's the original Hallyu star!
- He's the original muscle-man!

252
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,000
Jong Kook is kind of like
a fake version of Jun Yup.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was the first celebrity with a tan.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,030
Where did you get a tan?

255
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,870
On the roof.

256
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,400
I did it at the tanning shop.

257
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,270
We thought he got tanned
the same way we did, but.

258
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,300
- He owned a tanning machine at home!
- At home?

259
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,470
I was cheated...
I bought it because of him.

260
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,530
What do you mean?

261
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,830
A newer machine came out,
so I bought a new one

262
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,270
and sold the old one to him
saying it was the new model.

263
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,980
I laid down for an hour and half,
and still didn't get tanned!

264
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,370
- It was just a fluorescent light!
- You have to replace the bulb!

265
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,970
I didn't know that...

266
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,270
[What about Jae Hun's record?]

267
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,230
I didn't really calculate the numbers.
I just tried my best.

268
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,670
[He claims he remained
distant from commercialism.]

269
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,600
Didn't you say
you sold 2 million earlier?

270
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,010
- The thing is...
- This watch is also a voice recorder!

271
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,470
- From a million to 2.8 million...
- Wow!

272
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,180
- How much have you sold?
- Ten thousand?

273
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,600
- How about you?
- 2400 albums.

274
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,500
[Depressed]

275
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,900
[They're choosing
which legend to pick.]

276
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,730
[The blue team's first choice is]
Kim Gun Mo!

277
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,400
[They choose the most
beneficial person first.]

278
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,600
We're good to go!

279
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,070
One, two, three!
Bro Jun!

280
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,230
[It's more beneficial if they have
a higher number of albums sold.]

281
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,980
Lee Ha Neul!

282
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,830
I don't want to be on that team
with Gun Mo!

283
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,670
Then, we pick... one two three!

284
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,300
Jae Hun!

285
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,070
And Jun Yup!

286
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:33,400
[The red team is Jae Suk, Gary, Blank
Ji, Bro Jun, Jae Hun, and Jun Yup.]

287
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,630
[The blue team is Big Nose, Ha Ha,
Kwang Soo, Gun Mo, Ha Neul, and Kkuk.]

288
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,640
They're nothing without Jong Kook.

289
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,330
What?

290
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,100
- Ha Neul said you guys are soft!
- Like jelly!

291
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,030
Kim Gun Mo's third album,
released in 1995

292
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,030
sold 2.8 million.

293
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,930
[He entered in the Guinness
Book of World Records.]

294
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,800
DJ DOC's third album, released in 1996

295
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,200
sold 1.95 million.

296
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
1.95 million?

297
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,070
Turbo's third album, released in 1997

298
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,300
sold 1.4 million.

299
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,770
Your starting point is 6.15 million.

300
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,300
[They're already happy
before they even started.]

301
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,890
CLON's first album, released in 1996

302
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,530
sold 1.12 million.

303
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,370
Cool's third album, released in 1996.

304
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,370
- Third?
- 2 million?

305
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,130
Sold 1.07 million.

306
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,130
[They have a lot, too...]

307
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,730
g.o.d.'s third album, released in 2000

308
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,830
sold 1.85 million.

309
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,430
Your starting point is 4.04 million.

310
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,030
The difference between
the two teams is 2 million.

311
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,400
[They're heading to the first
mission site with the legends.]

312
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,530
- The best street, back in the day!
- It's the Rodeo street!

313
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,000
- Did the hamburger place disappear?
- There was a hamburger place!

314
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,200
- Over there!
- It's the main street!

315
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,970
There's a bakery down the alley.

316
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,400
If you see towards the right,
there was a cart full of CD's.

317
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,030
The place that sold
most pirated tapes, was here.

318
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,570
- Yeah, over there!
- At the time, when our album came out

319
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,400
we would bring it to the seller
and ask him to play our music.

320
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,330
- I'm getting flashbacks!
- It was so lively, back then.

321
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,130
- There was music in the street...
- It's illegal to play music in public.

322
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,570
[Only the hottest music
was played on the Rodeo street.]

323
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,300
[Even if they were stars, they asked to
play their music at the cart-stand.]

324
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,370
Here's the first mission.

325
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:16,370
You will be going to the Apgujung
Rodeo Street that you mentioned.

326
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,170
The mission you will do first is

327
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,630
'Relay the song with the citizen.'

328
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,970
The citizen has to continue
the song you sing.

329
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,900
You have to find a citizen that
will participate in the mission.

330
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,800
One of the million sellers will
start singing one of their songs.

331
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,100
Then, you have to pass
the mic onto the citizen

332
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,630
and they must perfectly sing the next
phrase without making an error.

333
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,670
You will receive 50,000 albums
per succeeding citizen.

334
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,730
You have 30 minutes for this mission.

335
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,030
The million seller has to
sing their song.

336
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,730
- G.o.d!
- I have a good feeling about this!

337
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,170
Jae Hun, what's yours?

338
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,400
- Mine's 'Destiny'.

[Suddenly looking around]

560

We came here not knowing
it's a popular shop among stars.

561

Alright, then we'll start right away.

562

I think she's emotional like a girl.

565

Did you see how she swept her hair?

566
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,500
[She's doing it again.]

567

She was only in the fashion business.

574
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,670
It's regretful.

575
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,830

I remember passing by
many celebrities on this street.

583
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,970
It's easier to see them here
than in the broadcast stations.

the only ones here?]

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,830
[At long last, he's back here...]
You can order, but...

681
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,870
Let's not say 'but.'

682
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,300
You need to pay for the food
with the album count.

683
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,270
[They can pay with the album count.]

684
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,700
Each 10,000 won is worth
100,000 discs.

685
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,470
That's not fair!

686
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,370
Then, Jae Suk can't eat the steak!

687
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,900
[The tragic dish
that Jae Suk couldn't eat.]

688
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,570
This is 60,000 won and
it equals 600,000 discs!

689
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,300
- Six hundred thousand discs!
- He came back after so many years!

690
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,670
It's been ten...
no, 20 years!

691
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,630
Now, we have to order the
same thing you ordered.

692
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,000
Just like Jae Hun said, we need
to order a stew for three people

693
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,910
and some ramen noodles.

694
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,830
This drives me crazy!

695
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,300
Jae Suk, let's just order the steak.
We can do better at the next game.

696
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,510
That assorted grilled meat platter
is good, especially the sauce!

697
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,570
You need to eat well,
so you can do better.

698
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,970
[What will the Grasshopper's
decision be?]

699
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,770
[The blue team decided to
get the cold buckwheat noodles.]

700
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,170
We'll take away 100,000 discs
per 10,000 won.

701
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,030
That's too harsh!

702
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,000
It's not that expensive here.

703
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,970
50,000 won is
500,000 discs?

704
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,030
If it's 36,000 won, we'll round up
and take four hundred thousand discs.

705
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,130
- How much is the noodle?
- The cold noodle is 7,000 won.

706
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,840
Six times six is 36,
so it's 40,000 won.

707
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,430
Let's eat that first
and then see how it goes.

708
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,770
Wait, 40,000 won means they'll
take away 400,000 discs.

709
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,970
- We can earn it back.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

710
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:03,200
I'm sorry...
but let's order a pork cutlet.

711
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,960
- Don't say that!
- It's an extravagance!

712
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,170
Ha Ha, dumplings are better.

713
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,130
[Do you want me?]

714
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,730
- It's 5,000 won for six dumplings!
- It's perfect for six people!

715
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,630
It's too expensive.

716
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,200
- We need to save.
- They take away the same anyway.

717
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,530
We all work in order to eat.

718
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,930
Ha Neul, if we resist,
we can get the golden disc.

719
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,870
We should not waste here.

720
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,350
I don't eat dumplings anyway.

721
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,580
We won't be running
for the next game.

722
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,700
This is too harsh.

723
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,570
I really want to eat the dumplings.

724
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,870
We need to save.

725
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,390
Did you decide?

726
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,870
Yes, we'll only order
six buckwheat noodles.

727
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:51,430
- Then the price will be 42,000 won.
- Get some radish Kimchi.

728
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,070
400,000 discs.

729
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,770
Then, we'll accept
the majority decision.

730
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:00,070
I think we should eat what we want.
And do our best later.

731
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,800
- How about you, Gary?
- Same, everyone sweated a lot.

732
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,930
We'll do our best!

733
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,400
- What about you?
- The best!

734
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,670
Excuse me, can we get
the assorted grilled meat platter?

735
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,400
[Unanimity]

736
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,170
I'm so touched.
Everyone wanted to fulfill my desire.

737
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,730
My team all agreed
to order it for me.

738
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,300
We'll use the discs.
We'll have assorted meat platter.

739
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,370
Please give us a free steamed rice!

740
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,470
- Then sausage stew...
- Sausage stew!

741
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,170
Also, one sausage stew, please.

742
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,700
- Then how much is it in total?
- 680,000 discs!

743
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,000
[They're about to spend 700,000 discs.]

744
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,500
What year did you come here?

745
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,470
- When you couldn't eat the steak.
- It was 1991.

746
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,030
1991?

747
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,330
This is the tearful steak.

748
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,800
[Here comes the steak!]

749
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,970
[The platter arrives.]

750
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,470
I really wanted to eat this!

751
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,700
- In 1991, I...
- These onions!

752
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,970
She gave us a lot!
Thank you for the generous servings!

753
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,470
Jae Suk, take the first scoop.

754
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,230
- Help yourself.
- Eat a lot, Jae Suk.

755
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,600
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone!

756
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,430
I won't forget this.

757
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,530
I'll have this first.

758
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:33,270
[I never knew I would eat this
after 20 years.]

759
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,370
[What a rich flavor!]

760
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,130
[His dream comes true.]

761
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,470
Try some.
[DJ Koo tries.]

762
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,870
[Jun Hyung likes it, too.]
It's good.

763
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,570
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

764
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,900
This is the taste of memory.

765
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,400
[Love follows the grilled meat.]

766
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
Even kids will love this.

767
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,100
[While the red team enjoys
the luxurious meal...]

768
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,400
- This looks so good!
- It was a good choice!

769
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,670
This is perfect for the weather.

770
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,100
Eating dumplings on top of this
will be too much.

771
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,670
Let's take a picture first.

772
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,840
What is it?

773
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,570
[Here comes the dumplings.]
Is it on the house?

774
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,430
- Thank you so much.
- Excuse me.

775
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,530
Did they order the dumplings?

776
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,720
[Of course]
We ordered this?

777
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,570
How much is it?

778
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,800
- We ordered this?
- It's 10,000 won for a dozen?

779
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,370
Who ordered it?

780
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,400
Let's just eat it.
I think Kwang Soo made a mistake.

781
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,900
[Kwang Soo's mistake, you say?]

782
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,070
<i>Please give us six
cold buckwheat noodles.</i>

783
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,370
<i>Go order the dumplings.</i>

784
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,240
<i>Go to the next store
and order the dumplings.</i>

785
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,370
<i>Just ask how much they are.</i>

786
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,970
<i>How much are the fried dumplings?</i>

787
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,800
<i>- It's 5,000 won.
- 5,000 won?</i>

788
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,600
<i>Can I have two servings?
10,000 won worth.</i>

789
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,930
[The blue team has
6.3 million discs.]

790
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,870
Why did you do that, Kwang Soo?

791
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,430
You told me to order them.

792
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,400
- I wasn't going to say it!
- I was joking!

793
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,600
It's good though.

794
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,970
Don't fight when you eat.

795
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,500
[The red team's hearty meal.]

796
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,100
You ordered the grilled meat platter
and four servings of sausage stew.

797
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,800
We're in the middle of eating.

798
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,630
Two servings of stew for two tables
and four bowls of rice.

799
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,270
So, it's 96,000 won.
It's same as one million discs.

800
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,900
[One million?]

801
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,660
I should be nine hundred
sixty thousand, not a million.

802
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,300
Gun Mo sold 2.8 million discs.

803
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,030
If he comes here and eat twice.
He'll lose everything.

804
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,900
[What an rip-off!]

805
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,900
Let's go get some dessert!

806
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,200
- It's coming!
- Thank you!

807
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,300
[Two red bean shaved ice
cost 16,000 won.]

808
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,330
- You know, let's do our best...
- And win!

809
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:11,380
- What's that?
- It's on the house.

810
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,130
Thank you so much!

811
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,920
- How much does it cost?
- It's 11,000 won.

812
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,490
That's a hundred thousand.

813
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,530
We haven't eaten it yet.

814
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:26,500
- It's a free treat.
- We can't throw this out.

815
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,600
Give it to the production crew.

816
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,370
[We're not going to eat it?]

817
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,130
But this is really good...

818
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,400
[Looks juicy]

819
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,600
Kwang Soo, wait!

820
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,970
- I can't help it.
- Just think about it one more time.

821
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,330
You already know how it tastes like.

822
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,930
Honestly, I've never had it before.

823
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,970
How about playing rock-paper-scissors?

824
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,070
We'll give you 10,000 won
if we lose.

825
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,970
- You won't charge us, if we win.
- That's a good idea.

826
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,200
Can we do that?
Be our rep, Gun Mo.

827
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,600
- Take out five hundred thousand.
- What for?

828
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,130
So, we can buy the
shaved ice for everyone.

829
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,930
He wants to be generous.
[But that's not your private money.]

830
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,670
[The magnanimous, Gunsour]
(Like Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan)

831
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,000
You're too much!

832
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,870
What's wrong with you?

833
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,900
We don't know him.

834
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,730
- Red bean shaved ice...
- Kim Gun Mo is ousted!

835
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,270
[Kim Gun Mo is ousted!]

836
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,670
[An unwary victim]
He's enjoying it.

837
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,600
- Shall we do it?
- Either a hundred thousand...

838
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,930
It'll be a single round match!

839
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:37,800
You'll lose, if you don't throw.
Rock-paper-scissors!

840
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,900
[Rock-paper-scissors!]

841
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,670
[He saw it.]

842
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,630
[He threw it after he saw his.]

843
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:50,110
[It's piece of cake.]

844
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,700
[The PD realized it too late.]

845
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,930
- That's foul play.
- No, it's not.

846
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,770
He threw it on time.

847
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,320
The PD is too naive.

848
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,430
[Frustrated]

849
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,270
How are you going to
live in this harsh world?

850
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,770
[This tastes fantastic!]

851
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:17,900
[I can't let the mango leave...]

852
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,200
Then, let me have a bite.

853
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,810
[He couldn't contain himself.]

854
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,730
It's funny he asked for a bite.

855
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,230
[The blue team even
had a free dessert.]

856
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:39,000
- That was a good meal.
- It was delicious.

857
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,800
Aw... thank you, Ji Hyo.

[The have a lot less discs,
but they feel more rich.]

859
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,500
How many discs did we use?

860
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,930
Probably, 400,000 to 500,000 discs.

861
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:55,200
- We heard you ate a lot.
- Yes.

862
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
You don't have that much money.

863
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,470
Please, buy us a cup of coffee.

864
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,670
- How much is it?
- 10,000 won equals 100,000 discs.

865
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,100
Honestly, we started off...

866
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,000
Right, we had a lot less
discs from the beginning.

867
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,830
[Negotiations under the table]

868

Let's hear her saying 'I dreamed of you.'

870
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,270
[Oh, no...]

871

[Laugh]

873
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,070
Just do it.

874
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,830
I dreamed of you,
I dreamed of coffee.

875
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,630
I had a poop, a diarrhea poop.

876

I'm cuter!
I'm cuter than you!

[What's with him?]

878
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:55,130

[The red team is far
behind the blue team.]

We filmed our version of Avengers here.

884
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,970
And the real Avengers
was filmed here, too.

885

[He had lots of hair when they
had their third album in 1996.]

894

Just look at my album!

895
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,130
- How did you get this CD?
- It looks cheesy.

896
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,270
A student designed it
for a part-time job.

935
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,330
- Oh, no.
- You must have eaten a lot.

936
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,470
- The gap is too big.
- At this spot, you'll pass ten million.

937
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,900
Basically, you see
the game board over there?

938
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,430
You'll play the game
by flipping the number.

939
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,630
On top of the game,
there are variables today.

940
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,900
You have two chances.

They're singing right now.

950

- Did we cast them?
- No, they're passersby.

952
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,130
So far, a few groups
have sang in there.

Outside, it has the sign
'the nostalgic noraebang.'

956
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,930
Inside the box, there are posters

957
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,030
with the song list of your songs.

958
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,430
Therefore, inside the singing booth
of the busy street of Shinchon

959
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,700
if they pick one of your songs and sing

960
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,700
the team will get 500,000 discs.

961

- 500, 000 discs?
- Awesome!

- Someone's singing.
- Is the score recorded?

964
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,210
If anyone sings one of your songs

965
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,400
the alarm will sound and
you'll get 500,000 discs.

966
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,730
This chance will be effective from now
until someone passes ten million discs.

967
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,700
[The nostalgic noraebang
will be the key to winning.]

The second chance is...

975

'I miss you, my friend.'

976
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:06,370
From now on, you can call
one singer friend.

977
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,260
Just one person.

978
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,300
If the singer completes
the mission with you

979
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,370
top album sales of
the singer will be added.

980
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,900
Who should we call?

981
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,830
- It has to be one person.
- We need to discuss it first.

Who should we call?

983

- Ask what's their top sale?
- What number is the most sold album?

989
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,230
Their fourth album sold 1.48 million.

990
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,430
What are you doing, Hee Jun?
Are you filming?

Can you come here for 30 minutes?

996
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,170
Tell him he can wear a mask.

997
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,100
They're in the middle of practicing.
So, it'll be hard.

998
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,530
That's too bad.

999
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,200

His phone's off.

1003

It says Kim Jong Suh's second album
sold more than a million.

1004
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:45,070
- Let's call Jong Suh.
- Yes, do that.

1005
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,430
Hello, Jong Suh?

1006
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,770

for 30 minutes.

1016
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,430
Thank you so much!

1017
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,230
Come quickly!

1018
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,700
[They've succeeded at casting.]

1019
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,400
- 1.58 million sold.
- The score will be similar.

1020
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,170
Call Sung Soo of Cool.

1021
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,800
[What? The Sung Soo I know?]

1022
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,870
[We're filming 'Running Man.'
Can you come?]

1023
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,370
That'll do!

1024
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,500
[Stood up]

1025
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:00,500
It's Jae Hun.
It's weird here, don't come!

1026
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,930
Come, Sung Soo!
[He's not that cool.]

1027
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,430
If you don't come, I'll
write you a letter.

1028
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:13,770
Tell him you'll write a letter
and make it song lyrics.

1029
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:17,030
Jun Yup is upset to hear that.

1030
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,930
[Why do you keep
talking about letters?]

1031
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,230
<i>- Please calm down.
- We didn't do anything.</i>

1032
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,570
<i>All of a sudden,
they dissed us in their song.</i>

1033
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,370
<i>They said we had
a voice of a dog seller.</i>

1034
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,270
<i>He was a real gangster back then.</i>

1035
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,300
<i>We're nice to each other now.</i>

1036
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,570
<i>Thanks to him
'Show Me the Money' started.</i>

1037
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:45,100
Sung Soo, come quickly.

1038
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,330
- Is he coming?
- Yes!

1039
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:51,300
Okay, that's the end of it.

1040
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,830
- But you don't know who we called.
- Who did you call?

1041
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,800
[He's sending a text message.]

1042
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,530
[In a moment]

1043
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,400
[Another million seller
came for the red team!]

1044
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,900
[The one who could reverse the result!]

1045
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,600
For those of you
who are tired and hungry

1046
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,970
we've prepared a snack bar
behind the monitor.

1047
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,170
If you see the menu

1048
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,430
there's a price list.

1049
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,430
But whatever you want.

1050
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,770
Ice is priced for 50,000 discs?

1051
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,530
A bottle of juice is for 100,000.

1052
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,930
Bag of popcorn is 10,000.
I 'll never be able to eat it.

1053
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,130
Are you buying it now?

1054
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,850
[Gunsour and his bodyguards
came to spend.]

1055
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,960
Don't use it just to by funny!

1056
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,430
He wants to eat something!

1057
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,670
I just want to buy a pack of gum.
It's just 50,000 discs.

1058
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:50,200
50,000 discs?
I only sold 2,400 discs!

1059
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,200
[Come again, Gunsour.]
Pay us 10,000 discs for a piece of gum.

1060
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,000
Ji Hyo, he gave you 10,000 discs worth.

1061
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,180
Ha Neul is getting a phone call.

1062
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:07,030
- It feels weird.
- Just answer it.

1063
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,570
[Kim Sung Soo]
Ha Neul...

1064
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:14,170
- Yes, Sung Soo.
- My child is alone, I can't go.

1065
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,930
My child is alone, I can't go.

1066
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,100
[All of a sudden?]

1067
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:30,700
[Jae Suk sent Sung Soo a message
telling him not to come.]

1068
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,840
[My plan worked!]

1069
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,130
[The blue team is
in a state of emergency.]

1070
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,700
- She's big!
- Bring her with you!

1071
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,350
[It's like they're having a party.]

1072
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,300
Sung Soo, is this how it is?

1073
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,470
Give me the phone.

1074
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,870
Give us 100,000 discs.
We'll make him come.

1075
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:58,900
What's going on?
Are they gangsters or what?

1076
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,200
Give us 100,000 discs.
We'll make him come!

1077
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,170
- Are you sure he'll come?
- He'll come for sure.

1078
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,970
[Gunsour is already preparing
100,000 discs for them.]

1079
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,630
[They receive 100,000 discs first.]

1080
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,520
- That's sneaky!
- Call him now.

1081
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,500
[He's calling Sung Soo right away.]

1082
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,930
100,000 is not that easy to make!

1083
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,560
Call them right now
and tell them you'll go.

1084
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,130
[Will Sung Soo leaves
at one call of Jae Suk?]

1085
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,870
Wait, Sung Soo's calling.

1086
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,170
Just don't come!

1087
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:44,480
Good job!

1088
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,930
[The controversy about Kim Sung Soo
reversed again.]

1089
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,070
- Call Tae Woo from g.o.d.
- Answer the phone.

1090
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,930
You'll play rock-paper-scissors
and pick a number from the board.

1091
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,530
Gun mo never lost.

1092
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:00,730
You'll lose, if you don't throw.
Rock-paper-scissors!

1093
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,670
[Jun Hyung wins.]

1094
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,270
[The red team can
choose the first game.]

1095
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,170
It's fine.

1096
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,300
- Ten!
- Ten?

1097
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,170
This game is for 500,000 discs.

1098
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,400
[The classic zero game]
Pick three reps.

1099
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,430
You know how to play the zero game.

1100
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,540
Call our a number.

1101
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,910
If the number matches,
the person will escape.

1102
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,270
The team that all the
members escape will win.

1103
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,170
[Gun Mo, Ha Neul, Kwang Soo vs.
Jae Hun, Gary, Ji Hoon]

1104
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:34,270
The sneaky brothers will play it.

1105
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,270
Old and new sneak members.

1106
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:42,470
The team that all the
members escape will get 500,000 discs.

1107
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,800
That's a lot!

1108
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,100
Let's get something to eat,
if we win 500,000 discs.

1109
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,430
Ji Hyo, first.

1110
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:53,070
- We'll start now.
- Zero!

1111
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,930
[Lift]

1112
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,930
[Ji Hyo could have
escaped, if not Jae Hun]

1113
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:05,530
Let's just call out 'pang'
instead of 'zero.'

1114
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,760
Just call it 'zero.'

1115
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,470
'Pang' is a bit weird, I guess.

1116
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,630
From Kwang Soo.

1117
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:13,800
I'll call it now.
[Nervous]

1118
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,100
Kwang Soo's turn.

1119
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,770
Six!

1120
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,930
[It was five.]

1121
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,310
- Please do not move your lips like that.
- Why no?

1122
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,330
- Don't say it like that.
- That's okay.

1123
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,930
It's habit.

1124
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,500
- Please call out 'start.'
- Start!

1125
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,000
Zero!

1126
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,900
Gary.
[It's Gun Mo's turn.]

1127
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,870
- Is it you?
- It's my turn.

1128
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,330
Zero!

1129
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:48,200
This is how you play this game!

1130
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,870
You need to do it suddenly!

1131
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,400
After I say 'start.'

1132
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,400
Why does he have to be the judge?

1133
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,910
He's the famous MC,
but he doesn't have to be the judge!

1134
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,770
[It's Gun Mo's turn again.]

1135
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,270
Two!

1136
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,930
Two!

1137
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:11,370
[This time, Gunsour
succeeded without cheating.]

1138
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:19,660
[If Ha Neul and Kwang Soo escape,
they can get 500,000 discs!]

1139
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,700
[Gunsour escapes, Gary resumes.]

1140
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,230
Four!

1141
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,570
[It was close.]

1142
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,130
Two!

1143
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:38,810
[Ha Neul succeeded at his first try.]

1144
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,470
[Kwang Soo's the only one
left in the blue team.]

1145
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,370
Three!

1146
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,130
Start!

1147
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,200
Two!

1148
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,470
Please, make it clear, Gary.

1149
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:57,330
It's because my finger is like this...

1150
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,200
[He's imitating
'One Ear' from the movie 'Tazza']

1151
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,070
It's Jae Hun's turn.

1152
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,770
- Start!
- Zero!

1153
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,400
Zero!
[Lift]

1154
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,700
- Good job, Kwang Soo!
- Gary!

1155
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,000
Two!

1156
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,870
- Ji Hyo!
- One!

1157
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:19,100
[Ji Hyo's sudden attack worked.]

1158
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,400
- Wait!
- You said Ji Hyo, instead of start!

1159
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,960
Start and the name are the same thing.

1160
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,000
[Everyone is extremely sensitive.]

1161
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,200
It'll be either start or the name.

1162
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,500
- Start!
- Six!

1163
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,030
It's hard to succeed with six!

1164
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,600
- Kwang's misfortune continues?
- I'll do it this time!

1165
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,070
Start!

1166
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,800
This is perfect.
Three!

1167
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,200
[Jae Hun perfectly escapes.]

1168
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,970
[My finger just moved...]

1169

[Tell you finger to move properly!]

1170
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:03,000
[Why am I the last one?]

1171
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,770
This is all planned out!

1172
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:09,830
We planned to leave one person out.

1173
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:12,170
[Gary vs. Kwang Soo]
It's Gary's turn.

1174
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,530
Start!

1175
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,070
Two!

1176
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,230
[This can't be...]

1177
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,070
[The red team wins the class zero.]

1178
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,230
[Kwang Soo's misfortune
continues today...]

1179
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,270
You should complain.
You're older than him.

1180
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:36,690
What's wrong?
They're having fun.

1181
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,630
It's fine, it's fine.
Just give them 500,000 discs.

1182
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,500
We're still winning.

1212
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,430
Except the Ddakji and the players,
nothing should be on the mat.

1213
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:27,600
Please get outside of the mat.

if the game is bigger.]

Hit the blue one.

1232
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:33,130
- Lee Ha Neul, your knees are on.
- You're petty.

1233
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,870
[Judge Yoo is even more picky now.]

1234
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,230
- Ready.
- Can I start here?

1235
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,470
No, you should start from there.

1236
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,430
I like that Ddakji in particular.

1237
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:48,470
You can't touch each other.
Just hit Ddakji only.

1238
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:53,370
Why not?
You shouldn't touch each other's body.

1239
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,200
[It's all because of you, Jong Kook!]

1240

- Continue!
- Flip one more if you have time.

[Jun Yup's continuous success.]

1250
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:35,920
[Huh? Did he just flip the blue one?]

1251
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,770
[Why does Big-nose keep
flipping blue ones?]

1252
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
[What's this?]

01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,230
[Tap]

1254
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:56,230
[Huh?
He made it red.]

1255
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:00,270
[This is the bad
example of sneaky play.]

1256
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,470
[This player keeps\flipping
the wrong ddakji.]

1257
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,000
[You need to flip the red ones!]

1258
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,630
The red one!

1259
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:13,170
[Oh, you mean the red ones?]

1260

Good, Jun Yup!

1262
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,470

him from behind]

[Koo Jun Yup wins the Ddakji Othello.]

1266

Amazing!

1267
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:44,800
Why did you flip blue ones?

1268
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,200
[He's no use even if
he's the king of ddakji...]

1269
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,400
It's frustrating!

1270
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,400

[Please take a rest.]
You look tired, already.

I'm so thirsty!

1276
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:11,530
You need to hold it.

1277
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,520
I wouldn't be so mean
if you didn't hit our ddakji.

1278
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:20,260
I was going to make you kneel,
but I'm being generous.

1279
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,500
Jong Kook has gotten a lot nicer.

1280

1297

Just like this.

1299
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,570
