00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,900
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
are bad at this!

174
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,110
[Both teams take turns inserting the
swords until the pirate pops out.]

175
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,170
[The team that makes
the pirate pop out loses.]

176
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,950
[I'm not really good at this.]

177
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,150
[Just then...]

178
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,550
[Oh, my!]

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,390
[That person is?]

180
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,220
<i>The second chance is
'I miss you, my friend.'</i>

181
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,260
<i>From now on, you can call
one singer friend.</i>

182
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,950
<i>If the singer completes
the mission with you</i>

183
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,360
<i>the top album sales of
the singer will be added.</i>

184
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,930
<i>Hello.
I'm filming 'Running Man.'</i>

185
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,740
<i>You need to come here.
Just for 30 minutes.</i>

186
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,060
<i>Come quickly!</i>

187
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
[They succeeded right away,
and waited...]

188
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,880
He's here!

189
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,810
[The red team's guest singer!]

190
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,590
[Who will be the legend
that will flip the game results?]

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,260
[Kim Chang Ryul from DJ DOC.]

192
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,660
Kim Chang Ryul!
Kim Chang Ryul!

193
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,100
[He's a little confused,
but he greets everyone first.]

194
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,860
Doesn't he match with our clothing?

195
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,470
[He looks like a part
of the blue team.]

196
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,480
He wore his own clothes,
but they're that color?

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,680
I came because Jae Hoon called.
[Confused]

198
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,400
Chang Ryul is super busy, but he came.

199
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,450
[Thank you for coming
even though it was abrupt.]

200
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,860
- We're neighbors.
- Oh, really?

201
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,220
So, Chang Ryul us and play this game?

202
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,700
There is a separate
game he will challenge.

203
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,530
What if they fail that game?

204
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,210
- If they fail, it's over?
- They won't get any?

205
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,300
[They're explaining the rules now.]
You can flip the result?

206
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,210
[That's how it is.]

207
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,060
The mission you will be doing
is group jump roping.

208
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,460
Now that you have seven members,
two people turn the rope

209
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,860
and everyone will jump in one by one,
and when all five have jumped in

210
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,200
you will need to jump
ten times together.

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,630
You have three tries.

212
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:50,030
- If we lose... Ji Hyo jump in last.
- Let her turn the rope.

213
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,540
[1.95 million album count
depends on this game.]

214
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,170
[Pressure!]

215
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,010
- Chang Ryul, we believe in you!
- Yes, of course!

216
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,780
I've never played jump rope before.

217
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,600
How about we sing the
song in an irregular rhythm?

218
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,650
[You're a genius...]

219
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,490
[They're already making a plan.]

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,160
[The tricky brothers are on the move.]

221
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,800
[What the heck?]

222
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,500
[Are you guys ready to jump?]

223
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,740
[Group jump rope, round one start!]

224
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,110
[Perfectly off-beat]

225
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,740
[But Jae Hoon manages to jump in.]

226
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,020
[Next up is Chang Ryul.]

227
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,490
No, no!

228
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,790
[They failed their first try.]

229
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,560
[They succeeded with their plan.]
The beat was...

230
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,260
[What are you doing?]

231
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,870
[You did it!]

232
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,400
[Feeling wronged.]

233
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,610
[He makes a normal person into a
person who has no sense of rhythm.]

234
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,910
There were no physical collision,
so it does not count as cheating.

235
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,480
[Group jump rope, round two start!]

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,320
[The magical melody starts again...]

237
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,790
One, two, three!

238
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,290
[He even changed the song.]

239
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,100
[The song keeps changing
and they're off-beat.]

240
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,370
[This is driving us crazy.]
Don't get tricked by the sound.

241
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,500
[They can't even begin to jump in.]

242
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,070
Boom, boom, boom!
[He's counting the rhythm.]

243
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,610
[Oh, you're counting?]

244
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,680
[He changes the song again,
with a faster one.]

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
[The first runner up,
Jae Hoon jumps in.]

246
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,520
[They turn the rope
faster with the melody.]

247
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,190
[Caught]

248
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,190
[Chang Ryul fails.]

249
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,060
[What do I do?]

250
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
[Their plan succeeds, once again.]

251
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,700
[Bravo, Tricky Brother!]
It's more difficult to be wrong.

252
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,470
[He's a sinner for getting
caught in the rope once.]

253
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,980
Can Joo Hwan go instead?

254
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,950
[Chang Ryul came with
his son, Joo Hwan.]

255
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,250
This is the last try!

256
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,780
We have to focus.

257
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,090
We just need to jump ten times.

258
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,220
But on the last one,
we need to jump high.

259
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,160
[And another man is also
preparing the last battle.]

260
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,730
This time, it's a guitar.

261
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,530
[Group jump rope, round three start!]

262
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,500
[Now, he brings a guitar
in case they're used to the pattern.]

263
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,610
[The red team's last attempt.]

264
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,380
[Jae Hoon's stable entry.]

265
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,680
[Chang Ryul succeeds
at jumping in, too.]

266
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,020
Don't listen to them!

267
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,420
[Blank Ji's in!]

268
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,020
[Followed by Jun Yup!]

269
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,190
[Everyone, including bro Jun is in!]

270
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,060
[They just need to get 10 and
they will get 1.95 million!]

271
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,630
[Oh no... oh no... oh no!]

272
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,310
[They start counting!]

273
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,300
Four, five, six!

274
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,480
[Perfect synchronization!]

275
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,880
Five, six, seven, eight

276
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,150
nine!

277
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,420
[They got nine in a flash!]

278
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,390
[Just one more!]

279
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:51,130
[If we jump one more,
we'll get 1.95 million!]

280
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,670
Ten!

281
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,040
Eight, nine, ten!

282
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,470
[The red team succeeded
and earned 1.95 million!]

283
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,040
[We did it!]

284
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,650
[Their sense of rhythm overpowered
the tricky brothers!]

285
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,590
[The red team's superhero, Chang Ryul!]

286
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,260
[Chang Ryul... are you happy?]

287
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,300
Finally, we've reversed the score!

288
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,470
[6.4 million vs. 7.24 million]
[Thanks to Chang Ryul!]

289
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,700
Chang Ryul, we reversed the
score thanks to you!

290
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,260
I... I'm glad we won but...

291
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,470
If you're done, leave!

292
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,150
[Son, let's go...]

293
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,910
[He guiltily leaves in a hurry.]

294
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,550
- Bye!
- See you!

295
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,720
[The alarm is going off again!]

296
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,720
[Another million seller's
song is played!]

297
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,130
[Who's song is it, this time?]

298
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,200
<i>Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce!</i>

299
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,270
['Run To You' by DJ DOC.]

300
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,070
[He's happy in a flash.]

301
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,810
[That's our song!]
What's going on?

302
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,080
They're singing right now in Shinchon.

303
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,050
[He's glad to see
his fans unexpectedly.]

304
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,990
[Thank you!]

305
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,590
If they sing your song,
does that team get CDs?

306
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,800
[Yes, 500,000 CDs.]

307
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,870
[Joo Hwan is shopping
at the snack bar.]

308
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,200
- Here, have this.
- You can hang it around your neck.

309
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
It's the best!

310
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,310
[They spend 300,000 CDs
for Chang Ryul's son.]

311
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,780
[Because of this gift, both teams
have a similar amount of CDs.]

312
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,880
- Thanks, Joo Hwan.
- Bye!

313
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,820
[Chang Ryul leaves after
reversing the scores.]

314
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,290
So now, this game
depends on 800,000 CDs!

315
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,800
The entire team has to take turns.

316
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,730
You have to insert the swords.

317
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,570
If the pirate pops up, that team loses.

318
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,500
- Single round?
- Single round?

319
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,740
It's a single-round match!

320
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,020
We're at a disadvantage!

321
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,410
No, people with bad
luck go to the end.

322
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,110
[The Goddess of fortune,
Blank Ji will go first!]

323
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,820
Before, I was the first runner,
and it popped up on my first try.

324
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,590
If the pirate pops up,
that team loses.

325
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,420
I hope it pops up now
and the game ends.

326

[Big Nose gets everyone
to have high expectations.]

327
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,100
I want to see it pops, too.

328
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,470
You lose this, and you'll fail the
jump rope game with Sung Soo.

329
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,770
[In other words,
I wish you guys would lose.]

330
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,640
[They start the game,
hoping for a dramatic scene.]

331
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,180
- Suk Jin, you go first.
- I have a bad feeling.

332
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,480
I'll do it in one shot!

333
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,750
He's so confident!
[He survived!]

334
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,650
- Yeah!
- Now, Ji Hyo.

335

[The icon of luck, Blank Ji.]

336
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,230
[Passed safely]

[Lucky Blank Ji!]

338
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,600
- Now, Kwang Soo.
- Unlucky!

339

- Unlucky!
- Don't call me that!

[Fixed stare]

341

Okay!

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,810
Next is Jun Yup.

345
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,150
[Let's see...]

346
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,980
- You can't tell by looking.
- You two look alike!

347
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,460
They do!

348
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,660
[Please don't pop out this round!]

349
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,860
[Push]

350
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,900
[Jun Yup passed.]

351
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,070
[The third player is Ha Neul!]

352
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,940
He is Mapo-go's unluckiest man.

353
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,070
He used to be Incheon's unluckiest man!

354
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,640
[He's from the national constituency.]
You conquered Inchon.

355
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,940
He's the country's unluckiest man.

356
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,350
He's the leader of
the unlucky association.

357
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,950
No way, no way.

358
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,020
[No way...]

359
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,230
[Pop!]

360
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,540
[I am a legend.]

361
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,110
[The country's unluckiest man
Ha Neul failed.]

362
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,030
[Today is a lucky for the red team.]

363
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,940
- Unlucky, unlucky!
- I can't believe it!

364
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,270
[Oh, lord, why did you
give me these hands?]

365
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,950
[6.9 million vs. 7.74 million]

366
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,450
This is Suk Jin's, and
this is Kwang Soo's.

367
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,150
[Theirs are all close to the pop.]
You guys are amazing.

368
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,320
[The X-Men trio!]
That's incredible!

369
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,530
[The alarm is going off!]

370
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,070
[Someone's singing
in Shinchon, again!]

371
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,640
[This time, who's song is it?]

372
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,940
['The Moon of Seoul' by Kim Gun Mo.]

373
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,880
[Hoorah!]

374
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,180
[The blue team gets 500,000!]

375
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,380
She sings really well!

376
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,830
[Her singing skills are amazing!]

377
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,960
[Currently, dual live broadcasting.]

378
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,360
She sings really well!

379
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,860
[Everyone is surprised
at her talent.]

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,500
[Gaze]

381
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,500
[He stared for a long while]

382
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,710
[at the lady who was
singing his song...]

383
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,540
[A sweet melody flowing
under the moon of Seoul.]

384
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,380
[Meanwhile, the same
time at Sevit Island.]

385
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,550
[Someone is approaching
with energetic footsteps.]

386
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,160
[One, two, one, two]

387
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,740
[He warms up, and even
fixes his shoes laces.]

388
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,170
[Who is this determined person?]

389
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,100
[Kim Sung Soo from Cool.]

390
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,400
[Even with the abrupt call,
he came in a heartbeat.]

391
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,680
[It's a party time during break!]

392
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,580
['Before Sadness Comes' by Cool.]

393
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,660
[It's our song!]

394
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,160
[No hesitation, he walks in right away.]

395
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,220
[He's already in the mood.]

396
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,990
[Huh? This person is?]

397
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,560
[Casually]

398
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,530
[Wow, it's Kim Sung Soo!]

399
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,740
[The blue team's guest is here!]

400
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:03,910
[If the blue team succeeds,
they get 1.07 million!]

401
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,420
[Confused]
You're on our team!

402
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,920
[What kind of situation is this?]

403
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,790
Save your energy.
You need to jump.

404
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,760
You need to jump rope!

405
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,130
[What? Jump rope?]

406
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,360
If you win with Sung Soo,
and someone sings in Shinchon, it's over.

407
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,300
Sung Soo needs to do well.

408
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,670
It's group jump rope.

409
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,310
- Practice game?
- Sung Soo needs a practice game.

410
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,780
Jong Kook, I need to do it.

411
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,140
- Now.
- Go slowly.

412
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,110
[Oh my god!]

413
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,920
[Big accident!]

414
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,290
[Why did it get caught there...]

415
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,130
[Emergency treatment]

416
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,000
[Dizzy, dizzy]

417
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,870
[Group jump rope, round one starts!]

418
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,470
Challenge!
[First up is Sung Soo.]

419
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,770
- Slowly.
- Go in!

420
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,380
[Huh?]

421
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,380
[Hop, hop]

422
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,850
[What kind of a hopping was that?]

423
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,290
[Sung Soo is really bad!]

424
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,060
[The blue team fails their first try.]

425
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,630
[It doesn't work
like the way I do.]

426
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,230
[It's not over yet!
Group jump rope round two, starts!]

427
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,370
[First runner up is quick-paced Ha Ha.]

428
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,500
[He jumps in, in a flash.]

429
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,300
[Mr. Capable follows in, safely.]
Slowly.

430
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,200
- Slowly.
- Ha Neul wanted to make it harder.

431
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,130
[Gun Mo is counting out loud.]

432
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,750
[Ha Neul passed safely
with Gun Mo's shout.]

433
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,700
[Everyone, follow me.]

434
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,290
[Why are they so good
all of a sudden?]

435
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,700
[Kwang Soo jumps in safely, as well.]

436
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,730
[Now, only Sung Soo is left!]

437
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,470
[I'll take no more humiliation!]

438
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,680
[Now's the time!]

439
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,180
[Oh!]

440
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,050
[He fails as soon as he gets in.]

441
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,690
[Is he a relief pitcher, or an X-Man?]

442
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,060
We're good, we're good!

443
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,260
For a second, I thought you
just brought a citizen.

444
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,830
[I've never felt this much pressure.]

445
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,100
This is the last chance!

446
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,330
Challenge!

447
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,270
[This is the last chance
to get 1.07 million!]

448
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,740
[Mr. Capable is up first.]

449
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,340
[Lightly, lightly]

450
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,350
[Ha Neul jumps in next.]

451
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,500
[Ha Neul also succeeds.]

452
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,520
[The problem is Sung Soo!]

453
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,360
[Will Sung Soo be able to
save the last chance?]

454
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,270
[He succeeded!]

455
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,840
[Ha Ha also succeeded.]

456
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,970
[Flinch, flinch]

457
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,740
[Kwang Soo also passed safely!]

458
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,010
[They just need to jump ten times.]

459
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,310
[Sung Soo, where are you going?]

460
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,950
[He broke away from the line.]

461
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,120
[Caught]

462
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,490
[Sung Soo is the only one out.]

463
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,460
[They failed their last try.]

464
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,860
[What on earth happened?]

465
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,900
Why did you go out?

466
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,430
[Goodbye, 1.07 million CDs!]

467
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,710
- I went in!
- You can go now.

468
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,410
[Sung Soo, you're the best!]

469
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,580
Did you come to
sightseeing at the Han River?

470
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,240
'Running Man' doesn't suit me.

471
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,450
Please give him a round of applause!

472
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,300
[Let's do well next time!]
Thank you!

473

a brutal test of loyalty.]

Seven!

Move the CDs with your feet.

486

What?
Do you move it with your feet?

487
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,310
Each team lies down
on the mat in a line.

488
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,150
And then the first
person has to grab CDs

489

with their feet
and pass it over their head.

The last person needs to put the
CD in the basket above the head.

491

You'll get the number of CDs in
the basket times 100,000.

492
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,690
Both teams could surpass
10 million with this game.

the highest number will win.

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,000
- Give it to me!
- Here!

520
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,610
Gary, wait!

521
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,640
Give me more!

522
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,050
[Their passing speed
is getting faster!]

523
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,220
[They just got the hang of it,
but time's up!]

524
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,960
[Only if they got that in...]

525
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,290
[It was right in front of
the basket, too.]

526
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,390
How many are there?
I will count them!

527
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,000
One

528
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
two

529
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
three, four

530
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,840
five, six, seven, eight.

531
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,280
- We surpassed!
- Nine, ten.

532
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,380
[The counting doesn't end.]

533
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:37,350
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

534
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,420
[The red team got 23 CDs!]

535
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,130
[One CD is equivalent to
100,000 times 23 CDs.]

536
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,160
[The red team got
a total of 2.3 million!]

537
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,000
[They have to get 23 or
more to surpass them.]

538
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,900
[But, just then!]

539
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,740
[The alarm is going off once again!]

540
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,970
[The noraebang chance
continues until the end!]

541
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,470
[The blue team has their
final mission left.]

542
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,000
[Who will receive
the 500,000 CDs?]

543
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,750
[Isn't the song...]

544
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,370
[Kim Gun Mo's 'Beautiful Goodbye.']
That's Gun Mo's song!

545
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:25,970
[Absolute winner of the
noraebang chance, Kim Gun Mo.]

546
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,480
[The red team is suddenly nervous.]
We're going to win the race!

547
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,980
- Don't push it too hard.
- Just be safe and do it slowly.

548
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,790
- If someone sings another song...
- We just need to move 18 CDs!

549
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,020
This is the end.
[9.8 million vs. 11.54 million]

550
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:50,090
Keep doing the mission even If
someone else sings one of your songs.

551
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,000
[The blue team's practice.]
Try reach my feet.

552
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,940
It's easier to grab them like this.

553
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,740
[Embarrassing]
He had poop feet!

554
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,910
[He has cack-handed and cack-footed?]

555
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,540
We're going to get in trouble
because of Kwang Soo.

556
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,150
I think I'm not good at it.

557
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,800
[Yes, Kwang Soo gives us hope...]

558
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,180
- Grab it like this.
- With the soles of my feet?

559
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,100
Try clapping!
Yes, with the soles of your feet.

560
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
[Like this?]

561
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,360
He moved his feet like this.

562
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,090
It'll be hard if you do that.

563
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,660
Do you have a cramp, Kwang Soo?

564
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,030
I really have a cramp!

565
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,340
Look how weird my toes are!

566
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,130
[He has all kind of reasons...]

567
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,600
He really has a cramp.
We need to massage them.

568
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,370
- This is serious!
- Massage them.

569
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,520
- My toes look so weird!
- You need to massage them!

570
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,580
- We need to pull the leg.
- Stretch your leg.

571
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,040
You need to exercise more!

572
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,590
Let's hurry up!
People might sing their song.

573
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,800
We need to finish it
before that happens.

574
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,230
Just take a little at a time!

575
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,490
[Move the CDs, starts!]
No, take a lot!

576
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,960
- We can move ten CDs twice.
- No.

577
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,870
I'll just take this much.

578
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,740
That looks good!

579
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,380
Just pass it along.

580
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,780
Just pass it right away!

581
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,890
[Kwang Soo passes them
to Ha Ha right away.]

582
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,850
[Ha Ha passes them
to Suck Jin quickly.]

583
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,590
[Risky]

584
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,530
Wow!

585
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,100
[The blue team's speedy technique.]

586
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,430
[Shake, shake]

587
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,040
- Let them go!
- It's so tight!

588
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,270
[They only dropped one CD.]

589
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,030
[That's not good for us...]

590
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,240
This time, it's a lot!

591
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,880
If they succeed at it this time,
they'll win the race!

592
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,890
[Oh, no!]

593
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,720
[Slips]

594
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,760
[We can't turn the table,
if I drop them!]

595
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,830
[He dropped on CD
and survived the crisis.]

596
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,830
[It's a speedy relay again.]

597
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,870
That's great!

598
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,600
He's biting my feet!

599
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
Close your heel!

600
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,580
[That was a lot!]

601
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,640
[They're moving the CDs the third time.]
Slowly!

602
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,620
Time's up!

603
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,530
- Time's up.
- That looks like a near thing.

604
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,530
We'll count them now.

605
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,430
One, two, three, four, five.

606
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,170
- It has to be 18 CDs, right?
- Six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

607
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,000
[I know we have more than that.]

608
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,460
- One, two...
- It'll be the same if we have eight.

609
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,360
- Don't hide any of it.
- I won't.

610
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,330
- Four!
- Film it from behind.

611
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,520
They're leaving, too!

612
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,110
[The nostalgic noraebang is empty now.]

613
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,670
[Now, it depends on the CD count!]

614
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,830
[The blue team will win,
if they have more than 19 CDs.]

615
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,270
- Eight.
- Now, we're tied.

616
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,040
[If he has at least one CD,
the blue team will win.]

617
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,240
[Does he have more CDs?]

618
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,520
Nine!
[He has more!]

619
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,050
Ten, eleven!

620
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,390
[The blue team wins
the Million Seller Race!]

621
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,800
[12 million vs. 11.54 million]

622
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,130
[The red team loses
by a narrow margin.]

623
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,630
If we had one more song,
we would have...

624
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,100
Yes, the song from the noraebang
made us win!

625
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,670
We'll reward the blue team
with golden discs.

626
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,140
Thank you!

627
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,620
Don't cry!
Don't cry!

628
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,350
Take this!

629
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,330
[Only the winners
get the golden trophies.]

630
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,700
Therefore, today's
winner is the blue team!

631
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,860
Is that real gold?

632
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,170
- I didn't think I would work this hard.
- You did your best.

633
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,930
- You really did your best!
- You're normally not like this.

634
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,100
I'm very competitive,
but we did our best, too.

635
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,070
Even though we lost,
I'm still glad and happy.

636
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,210
That's right.

637
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,430
We also want to thank Kim Sung Soo
and Kim Chang Ryul

638
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,660
and the citizens who sang
at the nostalgic noraebang

639
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,630
and the citizens we
met in Apgujung-dong.

640
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,670
Thank you so much!

641
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,630
[Thank you very much!]

642
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Thank you, everyone!

643
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,770
- Let's take a picture!
- Take two pictures!

644
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,380
Let's take a picture together!

645
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,720
[Through the night, the party continued.]

646
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,550
[A few days later...]

647
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,720
- It's the fifth anniversary party!
- It's the fifth anniversary.

648
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,590
This is only the beginning!

649
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,090
- What's this?
- It's the fifth anniversary party.

650
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,850
- There's a viking ship, too!
- The anniversary party?

651
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,600
A viking ship!

652
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,290
There's candy draw, too!
What's that?

653
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,370
Congratulations on
the anniversary party!

654
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,600
Thank you!
[Running Man Night Festival]

655
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,340
- Look at this!
- Thank you!

656
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,340
To celebrate Running Man's
fifth anniversary

657
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,240
we rented a school park and
set up a night market.

658
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,590
Think of it as a festival
and enjoy it.

659
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,020
[Really?]
Are you sure?

660
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,260
You've never been nice.
What's the matter?

661
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,240
Are you going to pay for us?
I don't have money.

662
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,470
[Don't worry about it.
It's on house!]

663
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,400
[This is so rare.]
Oh, I picked a dud!

664
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,240
- Oh, no, I picked 18!
- 31! I picked a butterfly!

665
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,910
- I won the butterfly!
- 18 was nothing.

666
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,080
[Mr. Random Capable won
a giant butterfly candy.]

667
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,280
Oh, no.
Number 18...

668
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,820
Oh, you put some ice cream there?

669
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,120
Thank you so much!
It looks good.

670
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,160
[Crunch]
[Sweet flavor!]

671
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,370
- I want to get one of this.
- Is that a squid?

672
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,700
- Is it free?
- It's deep fried squid!

673
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,300
I've never seen it before.

674
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,340
Wow!
[Laugh]

675
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,280
- Try it.
- Thank you!

00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,950

[This is from my heart.]

680
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,600
Wow, I didn't expect it here.

681
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,990
[The fifth year anniversary is love.]
It's a heart!

682
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,920
Try this.

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,730
[Kkuk Thor is playing
with the hammer.]

684
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,670
[The highest score is 943.]
[What will be Jong Kook's score?]

685
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,330
[That was close!]

686

[Yoo-ames Bond is busy shooting.]
This is scary!

the viking ship by himself.]

688
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,180
When is it going to end?

689
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,850
[Kkuk and Blank Ji are horse racing.]
At this time of the day...

690
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,240
They're rewarding us
for the fifth year anniversary.

691
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,260
[The pirate ship is going to leave!]

692
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,060
[Scared]

693
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,100
My tummy is ticklish.

694
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,430
[That must be scary.]

695
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,540
Please, make it higher!

696
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,610
[The taste of hell]
They must be regretting taht.

697
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,040
[Noisy]

698
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,650
[The Running Men had no idea]

699
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,520
[about what would happen next.]

700
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,370
- Thank you!
- I won this!

701
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,240
- Wow, that sword?
- Yes, it's the dragon sword.

702
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,140
- How did you get this one?
- That's what I'm saying.

703
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:52,240
[Someone is approaching.]

704
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,420
- Oh, for Jae Suk's birthday?
- Ji Hyo, too.

705
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,600
Jae Suk's birthday is August 14,
Blank Ji is the 15th.

706
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,030
Ha Ha's birthday is 20th.

707
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,700
We have lots to celebrate!

708
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,870
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

709
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,160
<i>Happy birthday dear Jae Suk,
Ji Hyo, and Ha Ha.</i>

710
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,730
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

711
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,000
Thank you!

712
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,980
[Blow out]

713
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,950
Even birthday party?

714
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,470
Something's wrong.

715
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,830
[A dark change]

716
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,830
[A sudden change...]

717
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,870
[What's happening?]

718
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,940
[What's the building
behind the market?]

719
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,840
The night market is over.

720
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,680
For the next event,
we'll go behind the market.

721
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,110
- All of a sudden?
- What's this?

722
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,350
Why did you stop it like this?

723
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,490
- Look, I see the red light!
- Why red?

724
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:05,390
What kind of a party
ends like this?

725
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,460
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

726
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,690
Wouldn't a scary story
be perfect for this place?

727
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,600
- What's wrong with the lighting?
- Are there people inside?

728
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,100
What are you talking about?

729
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,870
- Don't talk nonsense!
- I'm scared, Kwang Soo!

730
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,410
That school looks like
it's closed down.

731
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,410
The place you were
having fun a minute ago

732
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,010
was a girls' high school
that was established in 1934.

733
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,080
A girls' high school?

734
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,520
Yes, it's so-called
'Closed girls' high school.

735
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,190
It was a girls' high school.

736
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,460
The real mission you
need to carry out today is.

737
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,160
'The horrifying loyalty
test with the staff.'

738
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,730
Two 'Running Man' members

739
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,370
and the VJs in charge of the members

740
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,640
will enter inside the abolished school.

741
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,040
You don't have your name tags
on your back..

742
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,380
You need to get inside
and find your name tag.

743
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,780
Then, you can go home.
Isn't that simple?

744
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,750
- Go straight home.
- It's driving me crazy.

745
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,160
Inside, not just the member's name tags

746
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,980
but also the name tags
for the VJs who's been

747
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,500
working with you for
the past five years.

748
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,630
You can find all the name tags together

749
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,950
and escape together and stay loyal.

750
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,260
Find them?

751
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,770
Or you can escape as soon as
finding your own name tag.

752
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,380
What if the VJ finds it first?

753
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,710
The VJ can pass the camera
and go home.

754
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,100
[This is a good time to test
their friendship.]

755
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,100
We're going to attach
heart rate monitors on VJs.

756
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:53,100
The VJ with the highest number
will be the first one to enter.

757
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,000
And the first team and decide
who they'll go together.

758
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,930
That means, just one pair
will enter in the end.

759
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,740
[Scream]

760
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,040
No way!
I can't do that!

761
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,840
[Shocked]

762
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,260
- Stop it!
- Don't do things like this!

763
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,430
- He's really...
- Stop it!

764
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,870
I almost hit you!

765
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,690
If anyone goes with Ji Hyo,
we'll faint when we see her.

766
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,960
She debuted in
'Whispering Corridors.'

767
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,270
Toshio!
(A character from 'The Grudge.')

768
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,830
[A mass exodus]

769
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,500
You scared me!
[What's wrong with her?]

770
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,070
- This drives me crazy!
- What's with your voice?

771
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,980
- Was that your voice?
- What's wrong with you?

772
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,980
- That's how you say it!
- You scared me!

773
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,870
I'm scared, too.

774
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,420
The way I see...

775
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,890
[Scared]

776
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,420
It's just grass!

777
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,700
I think I'm going to be
more scared because of you!

778
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,700
[The ankle grab]

779
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,640
[Scream]

780
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
[A good example of
'being frightened.']

781
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,540
[He's nose is big, but his
nerves are the size of a micrometer.]

782
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,770
[He would have fainted
if he did it inside the school.]

783
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,610
One of the VJs heart rate was 80
when we arrived here.

784
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,100
Now, it went up to 126.

785
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,830
- It's Gwon Yeol.
- Yes, It's Ryu Gwon Yeol.

786
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,250
I told you.

787
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,530
He looks terrified.

788
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,900
- His heart rate is still going up.
- It's 130.

789
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,540
Don't you need to
go to the hospital?

790
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,130
Do you have heart problems?

791
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,670
The first 'Running Man' member
will be Yoo Jae Suk.

792
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,030
And Ryu Gwon Yeol will be going.

793
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,610
So, you can name the person
that will go with you.

794
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,110
I'll take someone weak.

795
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,380
Ji Suk Jin, Lee Kwang Soo,
or Ha Ha...

796
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,050
I'd like to go at first.

797
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,420
- They're all cowards.
- I don't want to be the last.

798
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,300
- I can't get in by myself.
- You're begging to get in first?

799
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,300
I'll stay until you find your
name tag even if I find mine first.

800
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,370
I'm not going to find my name tag.

801
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,370
I'll hide my name tag,
if I find it first.

802
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,200
What are you talking about?

803
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,730
- Why are you lying?
- You're talking nonsense!

804
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,130
[Kwang Soo is excluded.]
Play rock-paper-scissors.

805
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,170
- Winner or loser?
- The one throws the same thing as me.

806
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,580
Just give me a chance!

807
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,020
Rock-paper-scissors!

808
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,460
[Big-nose: Scissors,
Jae Suk and Ha Ha: Paper]

809
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,660
Didn't you throw the same thing as me?

810
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,630
I thought he threw scissors.
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha are the first.]

811
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,930
[The members and VJs have
worked together for five years.]

812
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,340
[Their test of loyalty
is about to begin!]

813
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,740
[How strong their
friendship will be...]

814
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,080
[when they're placed in an
extreme situation?]

815
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,700
[We're going to find out.]

816
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,950
Four of you, go!

817
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,720
Promise me!
[Jae Suk and Gwon Yeol]

818
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,920
[Ha Ha and Sung Yong]
Gwon Yeol, let's go.

819
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,920
- Fight!
- I'll be back, Suk Jin!

820
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,330
- Oh, I won't be back.
- Right, goodbye!

821
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,470
[As soon as they find their own
name tags, anyone can go home.]

822
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,100
This is insane.

823
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,670
[The horrifying test of loyalty begins!]

824
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,570
The atmosphere is too scary!

825
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,450
I'm scared of grass
more than anything.

826
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,100
[Thump, thump]

827
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,380
Gwon Yeol!

828
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,520
Why are you keeping a distance?

829
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,850
I really don't want to go inside.

830
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,790
I'm going crazy.

831
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,460
I'm such a coward
and I hate it.

832
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,620
- What if we actually see a ghost?
- We'll go mad.

833
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,700
You scared me!

834
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,140
Don't kick things like this!

835
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,310
[Even before they get to the entrance,
they start making a fuss.]

836
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,310
I don't think I can go, either.

837
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,140
He's going to run
away before I will.

838
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,640
What a shame, both of you!
You stepped on a bone, Gwon Yeol.

839
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,550
[Gasp]

840
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,320
[He runs a mile away from it.]

841
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,630
What are you doing, Gwon Yeol?

842
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,060
He gets scared the most!

843
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,830
- Oh!
- What is it?

844
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840
What's this?
What's on my shoulder?

845
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Something dropped on my shoulder.

846
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,540
I felt something on my shoulder.

847
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,150
- There's nothing, Jae Suk!
- Something hit my shoulder.

848
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,920
It felt like a stone.

849
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,680
Isn't that more scary though?

850
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,890
In the middle of night,
who would throw something?

851
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,130
Can you tell them by radio?
I don't think we can do it.

852
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,700
If you're going to keep acting
like this, switch with Suk Jin.

853
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,070
This won't do.

854
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,870
- We can't move forward.
- Okay, I'll do it.

855
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,470
Hurry up.

856
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,480
Ha Ha, come here.

857
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,480
We can't escape it
if we just stand here.

858
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,780
[It looks mysterious
from the entrance.]

859
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,350
Should I really enter this school?

860
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,730
This drives me crazy.
[I miss my mommy...]

861
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,690
[Squeak]

862
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,770
[Why does the gate sound so scary?]

863
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,640
Is there any other way, Jae Suk?

864
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,640
[They open the gate.]

865
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,010
I saw it!

866
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,180
- You scared me!
- You're supposed to film me!

867
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,710
Gwon Yeol, you need to
go first and film me!

868
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,670
Aren't VJs supposed to do that?

869
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:12,200
Both of you need to
go first and film us.

870
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,900
- He drives me crazy.
- Where is this water flowing from?

871
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,500
Look, there's a mirror!

872
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,110
- How do they expect us to do this?
- Didn't you hear the music?

873
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,580
This is crazy!
How are we going to do this?

874
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,250
How can we search two floors?

875
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,580
Jae Suk, try covering
one of your eyes.

876
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,020
It feels a lot better!

877
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,750
Go this way, I'll go that way.

878
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,360
Let me know if you find my name tag!

879
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,300
I feel like I want to fart.

880
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,600
- Did you hear that?
- I heard it.

881
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,870
[Piano sound?]
It's girl's voice.

882
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,970
[It's hair-raising!]

883
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,910
- What's that?
- What was that?

884
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,150
Stop getting frightened!

885
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,360
[Grasshopper moves little by little.]

886
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,930
Honestly, isn't this too scary?

887
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,120
Why did they have to play the piano?

888
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,130
[There's a bathroom!]

889
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,500
[A lot of ghost stories in school
happen in the bathroom.]

890
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,850
[Maybe there's a name tag
in the bathroom.]

891
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,900
Gwon Yeol, you need to come in.

892
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,570
You need to film it here.

893
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,910
[Spooky]

894
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,440
[Surprised]

895
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:42,850
- This drives me nuts.
- What's going on?

896
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,790
[He found something!]

897
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,190
[Thump, thump]

898
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:55,290
This is place is bad.
There's poop.

899
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,830
[He found a suspicious room.]

900
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,230
[Glance]

901
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,670
I guess we're supposed to open it.

902
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,570
Look, there's an 'R sticker!'

903
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,040
- Should we open it?
- Scream and open it.

904
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,950
[Will there be someone's
name tag inside?]

905
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,120
[Scream]
What?

906
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,690
[In her arms...]

907
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,360
[she's holding a
suspicious clutch bag.]

908
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,490
Seriously!
[Let me see your bag.]

909
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,700
It's not going to move, right?

910
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,630
Something should be inside.

911
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,570
[Punch]

912
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,800
[He collects the
suspicious looking thing.]

913
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,440
What's this?

914
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,440
[Haroro collects the angel stone.]

915
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,950
[And he finds a flash light
inside the stone.]

916
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,150
We need to search places like this.

917
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,090
[There might be a name tag
inside one of the lockers.]

918
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,930
[Scream]

919
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,100
[Dud!
See you next time...]

920
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,370
[Aaaaaah!]

921
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,400
[I want to go home...]

922
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,900
We were scared of mannequins!

923
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,900
What's that?

924
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,800
What is it?

925
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,830
[Give me your legs!]

926
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,560
[Runs away]

927
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:47,770
Seriously!

928
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:51,270
[This is tiring...]

929
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,480
Where is the name tag?

930
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,250
Look at the hallway.

931
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,320
[How can a human
walk around this hallway?]

932
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,320
I'm going to go crazy...
That scared me!

933
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:16,060
You're not going to leave me
when you find your name tag, right?

934
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,100
[Are you talking about friendship now?]

935
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,570
Gwon Yeol, you haven't entered
any of these rooms first.

936
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,110
You always tell me to wait
until you get a good spot.

937
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:33,110
Why aren't you doing that here?

938
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,350
[What is this room?]

939
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,850
- Something's in there.
- Someone's in there.

940
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,130
[There's a mannequin here, too.]

941
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,600
[Surprised]

942
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:56,500
[They've opened the dance studio
that they shouldn't have.]

943
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,840
It's horrifying!

944
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,810
[The student shows up and dances
even after the school was abandoned...]

945
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,010
Why are you doing this?
Aren't you scared in here?

946
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,350
[Turns]

947
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,950
[Wimpy]

948
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,020
Gwon Yeol!
Where are you going?

949
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:26,000
Let me search here,
I need to find the name tags.

950
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,160
[Startled]

951
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,400
[She's coming!]

952
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,940
[Run for your life!]

953
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,180
[A ghost appears!]

954
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,250
[Oh my god!]

955
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,550
[What's that?]

956
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,250
[Trips]

957
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,990
Gwon Yeol!

958
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:53,790
[Is this slapstick comedy?]

959
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,230
Are you okay, Jae Suk?

960
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,430
What are you...

961
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,800
Seriously, what are you doing?

962
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,140
Are you okay?

963
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,510
Your ankle...

964
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,710
Do you know how many times
you stepped on me?

965
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,140
[The second floor is even scarier.]

966
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,020
This is unbelievable!

967
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,890
[Laugh]

968
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,560
Wasn't that Gwon Yeol's voice?

969
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,790
- Yes, it was.
- That was too...

970
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:32,460
There was a little boy
in Seorae village.

971
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,800
A ghost?

972
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,700
That little boy walked to Dong Hoon...

973
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,900
and told him to move
as soon as possible.

974
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,440
[Shudder]

975
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,610
I almost swore at you
with unspeakable words!

976
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,610
I saw his mouth!

977
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:57,270
The words I've never
spoke in my life...

978
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:03,190
Doesn't Ji Hyo look lively
ever since we came here?

979
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:08,300
Why did they scream?
What could it be?

980
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,070
[He's swearing out of fear.]

981
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,410
[Making spiteful remarks]

982
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,480
[If Ha Ha gets scared,
he becomes a master of the censor.]

983
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,180
Ha Ha.

984
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,550
[There's something inside
the mourning clothes.]

985
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,150
[Ryu Gwon Yeol]
[I found it!]

986
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:38,530
[Ha Ha finds Jae Suk's VJ's name tag.]

987
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:42,100
[He hides it in his back pocket.]
We'll escape together.

988
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:49,130
[Jae Suk's team is searching
in the candle room.]

989
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,500
By any chance, have you
seen any name tags...

990
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,410
[He has something.]
I'm sorry, but I need to escape.

991
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,500
[He finds Ha Ha's VJ's name tag.]

992
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,150
- Isn't Sung Yong Ha Ha's manager?
- Ha Ha's VJ.

993
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,330
[They both found VJs' name tags.]
We need to find our name tags.

994
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,930
[Jae Suk Joins in the
classroom full of ghosts.]

995
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,390
What's that?

996
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,760
You know what?
I found Sung Yong's.

997
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,040
What did you find?

998
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:32,380
- I found Gwon Yeol's.
- Let's trade.

999
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,800
What are you doing?

1000
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,570
Don't I get to keep that?
That's mine.

1001
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,680
Then, you're going to escape.

1002
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,470
Let's just keep it for each other.

1003
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,650
Let's trade when we find our name tags.

1004
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,470
I'm sure he's going to leave me.

1005
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,740
Wait a little, Sung Yong.

1006
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,800
Come inside, Gwon Yeol!

1007
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,000
[It's spooky here, too.]

1008
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,540
Aren't they scared?

1009
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,140
[Hesitates]

1010
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,680
[Chaos!]

1011
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,750
[Scream]

1012
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,620
[It's a visiting service.]

1013
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,620
Save me!

1014
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,300
- This is hell!
- Get in!

1015
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,830
There's no name tags here.

1016
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,940
- Is this yours?
- I found it!

1017
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,380
[Jae Suk found his own name tag.]
Let's get out of here.

1018
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,010
We just need to get yours.

1019
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,420
- Ha Ha has it.
- What should we do?

1020
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,880
When you're feeling no fear...

1021
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,770
I couldn't come here before.

1022
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,060
[What's this place for?]

1023
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,430
[Oh my god!]
Nothing can scare me any longer!

1024
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,830
Where's Gwon Yeol's?
I want to give it to him.

1025
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:11,500
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha trade their VJs'.]
Don't leave Ha Ha.

1026
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Let me keep it myself.
I won't escape without you.

1027
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,140
I don't want to give you.

1028
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:23,120
Where did you put it?
[Gwon Yeol already put it on his back.]

1029
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,850
I'll give it to you later.

1030
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,320
I'm sorry.

1031
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,890
You've worked so hard.
Let me put it on you.

1032
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,360
Let's get out of here.

1033
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,530
[The two men who
were loyal to each other.]

1034
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:40,570
[Jae Suk and Gwon Yeol
cleared the mission.]

1035
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,940
[It's time to go home.]
That was really scary.

1036
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,510
[When will they come back?]

1037
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,370
Aren't they mime artists?

1038
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,500
- He scared me!
- It's Jae Suk.

1039
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,920
Jae Suk escaped.

1040
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,410
Did you find your name tag?

1041
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,040
- Gwon Yeol found his, too.
- They got out together.

1042
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,760
How was it, Jae Suk?

1043
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,830
Why do you look absent-minded?

1044
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,190
He's thinner.

1045
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:12,270
- How was it?
- It's the hell.

1046
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,100
- It's that scary?
- What about Ha Ha?

1047
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,200
Ha Ha's still there?

1048
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,010
- Your name tag is...
- Gwon Yeol has it on the front.

1049
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,250
He's the worst!

1050
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,250
I'm not going to say it, but...

1051
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:34,020
he fell over me.

1052
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,420
Gwon Yeol.

1053
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,490
Yoon Sang's child was born just now.

1054
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:42,090
You need to go one more time.

1055
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:46,100
- He cried just now.
- Really?

1056
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,540
- His baby is just born.
- Congratulations, Yoon Sang!

1057
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,200
- Seriously?
- He was almost crying.

1058
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,670
Wouldn't Gwon Yeol go there again?

1059
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,340
The baby cried bravely

1060
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,880
so Daddy need to
go in and cry as well.

1061
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,650
[How will the baby's daddy,
Yoon Sang's loyalty be?]

1062
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,070
[Kwang Soo and Yoon Sang]
[Jong Kook and Ki Jin]

1063
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,920
[How will Giraffe and Mr. Capable's
friendship with their VJs be?]

1064
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,390
- When VJs run, together we can...
- I really don't want to do this.

1065
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,100
There's something in front of the gate,
like Jae Suk said.

1066
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,100
[Ha Ha is still looking
for his name tag.]

1067
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,400
[He opens a locker.]

1068
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,100
[Scream]

1069
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,670
Get out of the way!
[Ha Ha acquires his name tag.]

1070
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,910
[Ha Ha successfully
acquires his name tag.]

1071
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,510
Let's go, Sung Yong!

1072
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,380
[Shocked]

1073
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,050
[Spring at him all of a sudden]

1074
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,990
[Ha Ha and Sung Yong finally escape.]

1075
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,090
- You've worked so hard!
- You've worked so hard!

1076
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:48,780
- Ha Ha, how was it?
- You can't tell them all.

1077
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,700
I'm sorry.
They can't show what I've done.

1078
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,600
They can't broadcast it.
I swore so much.

1079
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,170
Sung Yong swore a lot, too.

1080
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:03,470
- You're getting old.
- Touch me, it's cold like ice.

1081
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:08,560
Sung Yong's heart rate reached 130.

1082
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,970
Maybe you're possessed.

1083
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:14,080
[My heart isn't working properly.]

1084
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,520
[While Kkuk was
looking for his name tag...]

1085
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,760
There's an 'R sticker.'

1086
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:25,000
Come in, what are you doing?
You need to come in.

1087
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,160
- I can see it from here.
- You need to come!

1088
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,200
The VJ should come closer.

1089
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,040
Argh!

1090
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,310
[Kkuk acquires the angel stone.]

1091
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:47,080
[He gets a flash light.]

1092
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,380
There's nothing here.

1093
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,220
There's really nothing.

1094
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:56,120
What's that?

1095
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,820
Why would boxes be here?

1096
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,700
[Peek-a-boo!]

1097
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,830
[Frightened!]

1098
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:07,070
[Even the VJ was frightened.]

1099
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,840
Aaaah!
Aaw!

1100
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,440
[Shocked]

1101
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,810
[shocked]

1102
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:21,210
[and shocked!]

1103
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,520
[He has a heart as weak as glass
but he has a strong voice.]

1104
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,920
[The school park is filled with
Kwang Soo's voice.]

1105
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,660
VJ came out first!

1106
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,790
- Who's that?
- That's Ki Jin!

1107
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,530
Ki Jin escaped?

1108
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,380
Did you give your
camera to Jong Kook?

1109
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,870
Yes.
Wow, he's shameless.

1110
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,140
[Ki Jin found his name tag
before Jong Kook's.]

1111
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,410
Let it go, Ki Jin!
[Kkuk and his VJ was bickering.]

1112
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:50,580
I wanted to come inside this room!

1113
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,950
Then, I'll keep it for now.
I need to go to bathroom.

1114
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,470
[But he ran away.]

1115
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,920
[A VJ gave up on his camera
and escaped.]

1116
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,050
I'll go home then.

1117
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,020
- He's cruel.
- He doesn't have a friendship.

1118
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,560
- Jong Kook didn't find his yet?
- No.

1119
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,030
Kim Ki Jin, you can go home.

1120
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,030
[Will he really leave?]
Are you leaving?

1121
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:15,700
Wow, he's leaving!

1122
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,270
People are merciless!

1123
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,100
[VJ Kkuk is recording
the scary ballerina.]

1124
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,030
[He carries around
the camera that his VJ left.]

1125
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,940
I'm sorry, I need to find something...

1126
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,770
[He's scared to death.]

1127
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,590
[He said he was scared,
but he was shaking with his camera.]

1128
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,860
I'm sorry.

1129
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,300
My life depends on this.

1130
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,400
[He found Kwang Soo's name tag.]

1131
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:58,270
Kwang Soo is coming soon.
Please be harsh on him.

1132
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,610
[Brother Kkuk is very thoughtful.]

1133
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,450
- They come out at a place like this.
- Please!

1134
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:06,770
I'm in a dangerous state.

1135
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:09,110
I'm not afraid,
I'm just worried about you.

1136
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,620
[Flinch]
What?

1137
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,220
Please don't do stuff like that.

1138
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,830
[Kwang Soo plucks up the courage
and starts searching.]

1139
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,400
[He found Yoon Sang's name tag.]

1140
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,730
I won't give it to you!

1141
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,570
Just show it to me.

1142
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,240
[He puts it inside his pocket.]
I see.

1143
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,540
If you found it before me...

1144
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,270
Let's get out of here first.

1145
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,610
This room looks too scary.

1146
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:43,800
We can't go in here,
they wouldn't have hid it here.

1147
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,900
- Don't go in.
- We need to find it.

1148
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,960
[The room full of unmarried ghosts.]

1149
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:57,260
- They might all stand up at once.
- They're mannequins.

1150
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,540
Wait, they might get up.

1151
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,730
Let's get out!

1152
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:06,800
[Kwang Soo couldn't
find his name tag yet.]

1153
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,930
Do you even need
to check the desks?

1154
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:12,960
[VJ Yoon Sang starts babbling
since he just became a dad.]

1155
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,540
Let's do it together.

1156
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:19,640
[Is he going to check all the desks?]

1157
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,000
[Gets up!]

1158
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,470
[This is my desk, Kwang Soo...]

1159
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,760
[VJ Yoon Sang is just looking at it.]

1160
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,100
How can a person stay still like this?

1161
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,470
[Good students study
without moving their bodies...]

1162
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,580
Let me just checked this one.
Thank you for your work.

1163
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,290
[He found something!]

1164
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,560
[He found Kkuk's name tag!]

1165
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,360
Let's make a deal.
Take that and give mine to me.

1166
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,200
This is a gift for you.

1167
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,630
[Kwang Soo gives
Yoon Sang his name tag.]

1168
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,530
[They can go home together.]

1169
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,470
Gary, please decide who
you want to go with.

1170
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:18,370
It might be funny
if Ji Hyo goes in by herself.

1171
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,760
I'm going to put this
plastic finger from behind.

1172
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,100
- It's the person that will go?
- Yes.

1173
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,870
Please, hold this finger.

1174
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:31,880
If Monday Couple go together,
it'll be boring.

1175
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,300
Gary!

1176
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,400
Please, save me once!

1177
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,800
Gary, help me once!
I'm going crazy!

1178
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,000
[Monday Couple, Ji Hyo?]
[Friendship between guys, Suk Jin?]

1179
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,340
Oh, yeah!

1180
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,370
[Seriously...]

1181
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,680
[Gary chose Monday Couple, Ji Hyo.]
Ji Hyo!

1182
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,050
[Big-nosed brother will
have to enter by himself.]

1183
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,350
It's not even funny, Ji Hyo.

1184
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,190
[As soon as they enter,
it's full of spooky air.]

1185
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,070
Where do we need to go first?

1186
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,490
[Will Monday Couple be
able to do it together?]

1187
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,470
Let me wait downstairs.

1188
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:19,800
Okay, get in.
I'll be watching you.

1189
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,700
[Kwang Soo pushes him forcefully.]
I don't know what's in the room.

1190
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,080
[When they opened the door,
she was there.]

1191
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,350
You can't enter this room.

1192
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,320
Seriously, I can't!

1193
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,590
[Being too scared, he's laughing.]

1194
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,220
She's dancing.

1195
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,660
[Why is he filming his feet?]

1196
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,560
[He runs away.]

1197
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,870
[She's scary, isn't she?]

1198
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,640
[Huh?]
Yoon Sang!

1199
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,450
[Yoon Sang's gone, and
the camera is abandoned.]

1200
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:12,450
Yoon Sang!
[VJ Yoon Sang escaped.]

1201
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,160
[He shouldn't have
given him the name tag.]

1202
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,730
Did he really leave??

1203
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:23,700
[The reality he doesn't want to believe.]
['I'm all alone.']

1204
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:29,030
[No choice but to pick up the camera]

1205
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,610
[He opens the door again,
and she's still dancing.]

1206
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:39,650
[I'll check this locker
and leave.]

1207
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,250
[At that moment, the door closes.]

1208
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:48,400
[Giraffe might master a vocalization
skill in the dance studio.]

1209
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,000
[I have your name tag.]

1210
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,030
Are you going to give
me the name tag or not?

1211
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,500
I'll give it to you.
[Just tell me what you want.]

1212
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,300
[Avoiding eye contact]

1213
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,100
- My name tag isn't here.
- Did you check?

1214
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,510
Yes, and there's nothing.
[Because I have it.]

1215
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,630
[It's ridiculous.]

1216
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:14,630
[They've hid each other's name tags.]
Let's get out together.

1217
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:18,970
We'll put it for each other.
We should have given it earlier.

1218
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,210
[Who are you blaming?]

1219
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,370
[Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are escaping?]

1220
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,800
- Put it on me.
- When we step outside.

1221
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,270
Where did you put my name tag?

1222
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,760
[I still have you name tag!]

1223
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,200
[Jong Kook collects his name tag
and goes to throw out Kwang Soo's.]

1224
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,760
Jong Kook, it's my fault!

1225
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,330
I won't do it again!

1226
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,870
[He gets to
the second floor in no time.]

1227
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:54,720
[And he throws Kwang Soo's
name tag in the dance studio.]

1228
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,820
My shoe is stuck!

1229
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,360
My shoe!

1230
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:05,430
[He needs to get back his name tag
in order to escape from the school.]

1231
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,500
Where did it go?

1232
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,770
[He saw it landed on the floor.]
Miss!

1233
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:18,710
[Ta-da!]

1234
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:24,350
Oh, please!
Please!

1235
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:27,410
What's wrong with her?

1236
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,660
[Don't eat it,
just give it to me!]

1237
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,820
Let me go...
I really need to...

1238
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:38,770
Ji Hyo and Gary are coming in now.
Please, let me go.

1239
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,700
[Giraffe begged the ballerina
and received his name tag.]

1240
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,400
[Ji Hyo is searching
the school by herself.]

1241
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:54,840
[She's doing it because she's scared.]

1242
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,240
[She's coming!
The horrifying stroller ghost!]

1243
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,100
<i>I'm on top of the world</i>

1244
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,070
<i>and there are many people
who love me.</i>

1245
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:13,190
[They want to overcome
the fear by singing.]

1246
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:16,310
[The dark spirit is getting stronger.]

1247
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,540
[There's something!]

1248
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,930
[Song Ji Hyo acquires
Gary's name tag!]

1249
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,970
[Scream]
[Frightened]

1250
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,780
Are you insane?

1251
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:32,300
- Are you okay?
- It's so scary.

1252
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,470
- Did you find anything?
- No, Gary...

1253
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,960
[She's going to keep it as a secret.]

1254
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,670
And that ghost lady is really scary.

1255
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,570
[Monday Couple enter
the art room together.]

1256
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:51,060
[That's Ji Hyo's name tag!]

1257
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,400
[Oh, I found it!]

1258
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,070
[Peek-a-boo!]

1259
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:59,540
I almost hit him!

1260
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,910
[Kang Gary acquires Ji Hyo's name tag!]

1261
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,540
Please give me the name tag.

1262
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,610
Don't worry, I'll give it to you.

1263
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,980
- Please, give my name tag, Gary.
- Turn around, I'll put it.

1264
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,750
- Give it to me, Gary!
- I'll put it on your back.

1265
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,730
[Were you scared, Ji Hyo?]

1266
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,960
[Don't worry,
I'm right next to you.]

1267
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,560
[It's a sweet moment
in a long while.]

1268
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,330
Gary, promise me one thing.

1269
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:31,240
[He gives his pinky
even before say talks.]

1270
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,300
Don't betray me for the next ten games!

1271
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,370
- Why would I do that?
- Let's be loyal!

1272
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:39,310
- Of course!
- Come over here.

1273
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,550
- Did you fine mine?
- Yes.

1274
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,380
[Ji Hyo answers with Gary's name tag
to Gary's loyalty.]

1275
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:50,850
Let's get out together, Gary!
[Monday Couple escape sharing hands.]

1276
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:55,560
Be careful!
Why did you jump three stairs over?

1277
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,230
How was it?

1278
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,830
- Offensive.
- The ghosts are?

1279
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,070
How was it?

1280
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,830
You...

1281
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:06,900
do this before you know it.

1282
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:11,230
[Scream!]
That's right.

1283
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,900
The next thing I knew,
I was screaming.

1284
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,580
- Let's clap for him.
- I'll be back.

1285
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,630
It's bearable.
If you scream ten times, it's over.

1286
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,300
I see.
This drives me crazy.

1287
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,870
I'm going there by myself.

1288
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:34,160
Seriously, we'll be together, Yoo Suk.

1289
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,930
We will, right?
Don't grin like that.

1290
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,440
I don't even know how to
operate this camera.

1291
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,540
Thank you for your hard work.
You can go home with your VJs.

1292
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,810
We're leaving. Will you be
able to sleep alone, Ji Hyo?

1293
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:53,950
[You need to get beat up.]
I see.

1294
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,950
[Even this doesn't work.]

1295
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:04,290
What's that?
[For Big-nose, the PD came with them.]

1296
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:07,960
That music.
Yoo Suk, come over here.

1297
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,970
You need to film in front of me.

1298
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:14,300
You need to film my face.

1299
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,700
I'm going insane.

1300
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,560
Mommy...

1301
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,070
Mommy...
[He's calling his mom at age 50.]

01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,370
[The nurse's office
is filled with red light.]

1303
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,990
It's a doll.

1304
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,370
[He's shocked to see the mannequin.]

1305
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:39,430
[And he's shocked to see
inside the locker and the toy.]

1306
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,700
There's nothing over here, right?

1307
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:50,510
[He's shocked to see the PD as well...]

1308
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,310
[The PD is big but weak]

1309
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:58,680
[and Big-nosed brother is old
but acts like a child.]

1310
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,810
I'm going crazy...

1311
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:05,050
[He enters the dance studio.]

1312
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:09,560
[He only saw her from the back
and he's taken aback.]

1313
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:21,000
Aaaaaah!

1314
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,100
[He move to the end of
the hallway instantly.]

1315
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:28,100
[Unfortunately, he ran
to the classroom of ghosts.]

1316
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,110
They're just mannequins, right?

1317
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:33,340
[He checks the locker first.]

1318
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,310
[He found the name tag!]

1319
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:42,350
[After that, he runs
out of the classroom.]

1320
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,690
[The stroller ghost visits
when they're careless.]

1321
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,930
Don't come near me!

1322
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,860
Don't come!

1323
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,160
[Runs]

1324
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,730
[He doesn't think about
anything else but runs away.]

1325
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:58,640
No!
Don't come!

1326
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,870
[The PD and VJ Yoo Suk follow him.]

1327
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:05,140
[Suk Jin, let's find my name tag
and escape together!]

1328
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,240
Yoo Suk, I'm sorry!

1329
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,150
I'm sorry, Yoo Suk!

1330
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:12,280
I can't do it any longer!
I'm going to get mad!

1331
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,950
I think I'm going crazy!
I'm sorry!

1332
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,890
Yoo Suk!
I think I'm going crazy!

1333
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,160
No, I think I'm going crazy!

1334
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Yoo Suk!

1335
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,030
Suk Jin, let's go together!

1336
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,430
I'm sorry!
I'll get out first!

1337
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:29,370
Let's go together!

1338
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:33,670
[Suk Jin left.]

1339
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:38,640
- Suk Jin!
- I'm sorry!

1340
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,910
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

1341
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:47,020
[He keeps repeating
that he's sorry.]

1342
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,690
[He's puzzled, and
his footsteps are heavy.]

1343
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,860
Suk Jin!

1344
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,790
I never want to do it again! Never!

1345
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:00,790
[After five years of working together...]
[Loyalty yields to fear.]
