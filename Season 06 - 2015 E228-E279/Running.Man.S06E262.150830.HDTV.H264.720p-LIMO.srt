00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,290
Were you calling someone else?

176
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,430
I was only calling
because you didn't come!

177
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,060
Big Eyes!
Shall we go, then?

178
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,060
[Jae Suk is in!]

179
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,700
[Everyone's slowly
finding their partners.]

180
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,640
I waited a long time.

181
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,680
I can't make a U-turn, here!

182
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,450
[Mr. Gun is lost and is wandering.]

183
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,420
[Looks around]

184
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,690
I usually wander for about
two hours when I come to Yeouido.

185
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,300
[At this rate, he'll be driving
around alone all day.]

186
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,900
[Meanwhile, Su Ro and Kkuk are]

187
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,940
[still discussing about their
teammate recruitment.]

188
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,140
- Ha Ha?
- Yeah.

189
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,040
Ha Ha's not that bad, to be honest.
It's easy to order him around.

190
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,650
But, you won't like his game skills.

191
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,880
That's hard...

192
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,090
I didn't pick up Gary's call.

193
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,290
[He rejects his close
friend just for victory.]

194
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,730
If were talking teamwork,
Ha Ha or Kwang Soo are better.

195
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,230
- We need to find Kwang Soo.
- I bet he's calling a female driver...

196
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,170
[Kwang Soo, we're coming for you.]

197
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,970
I think the Yeouido Middle School
driver will be lonely...

198
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,780
Since there was a call from the 63
building driver first, we'll go there.

199
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,550
[He's calling Navy Violet.]
This driver is friendly.

200
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,580
- Ha Ha!
- Oh, my!

201
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,950
- Where are you?
- Navy Violet!

202
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,090
- We're on our way!
- The driver won't let us out!

203
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,820
We have a female driver!

204
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,790
[Chaos]

205
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,200
- Navy Violet, are you at the 63 building?
- We're on our way!

206
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,530
- Yes, I'm there
- Stay there!

207
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,070
- Ha Ha, get off at 63 building!
- She called my name!

208
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,200
- Navy Violet!
- Just you wait!

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,510
[What are you guys doing?]

210
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,880
Please get on my taxi!

211
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,410
[I will get on that taxi
even if it goes to hell!]

212
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,680
Just wait a little!

213
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,290
Please go to 63 building.

214
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,690
I'm coming!

215
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,660
Ha Ha!
[Scream]

216
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,030
63, 63!
[Cute, cute]

217
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,800
[Please come this way!]

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
Sir... could you hurry...

219
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,770
Should I go there?

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,040
[Now's the time!]
Wait!

221
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,310
I am currently... wait!

222
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,480
[Runs away]

223
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,850
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo
both escaped.]

224
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,190
[Sorry, Sung Jin!]

225
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,060
[We need to go to Navy Violet's taxi!]

226
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,460
[Darn it.]

227
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,000
How did I lose both my customers?

228
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,000
[Upset]

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,070
What if I end up all alone?

230
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,080
[I won't lose the next customer!]

231
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,180
Who's Navy Violet?

232
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm curious.

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,220
Oh, it's a taxi!

234
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,890
[Sung Jin's taxi arrived.]

235
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,430
- I'll get on!
- Hold on, don't get in yet!

236
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,230
It was Kang Sung Jin!

237
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,740
- I'm slightly upset.
- Don't be!

238
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,910
I thought you were
at the LBS Annex!

239
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,140
[Main building, Annex,
I don't anything...]

240
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,640
This is my only show, so I'm not...

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,480
- Do I get in the back?
- Yes, get in.

242
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,120
- Get in the back.
- Oh, okay.

243
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,420
[He has a child-lock so
Gary can't run away.]

244
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,660
Wait, what are you doing?

245
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,220
There are some who got off.

246
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,260
[It actually doesn't open!]

247
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,530
[Escape if you can!]

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,440
Let's go!

249
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,270
Hello?

250
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,110
- Where are you?
- Where are you!

251
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,710
Navy Violet, where are you?

252
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,080
Ha Ha, you pushed me?

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,380
Wait, calm down.

254
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,420
Hold on, it's a red light.

255
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,890
- It's Bo Ra!
- Bo Ra, hi!

256
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,920
- Just wait, we're coming!
- Bo Ra, wait!

257
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,390
Kwang Soo, get in too!

258
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,830
- I'm coming!
- Both of you get in!

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,700
And then I'm going to throw
one away and get Ji Hyo.

260
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm going to get them... and then...

261
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,610
[We're coming!]

262
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,980
Then I'll get Ji Hyo...

263
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,950
Hurry and get in!

264
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,950
We're good to go!
Both of you get in...

265
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,020
Both of you get in.
Don't fight!

266
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,690
Don't fight!

267
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,720
Nice to meet you.

268
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,320
[She locks the door right away.]

269
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,430
We waited so long!

270
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,630
How have you been doing?

271
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,230
She's so pretty!

272
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,230
Thank you for riding in my taxi!

273
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you so much!

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,410
- She's already so grown...
- She drives now...

275
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,580
I've been accident-free for
two months, don't worry.

276
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,680
- Two months?
- Look at her talk...

277
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,980
She's so adorable.

278
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,690
[A mysterious plan
behind that smile.]

279
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,790
[Will she be able to execute it?]

280
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,730
[Big Nose is waiting
for Big Eyes taxi.]

281
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,160
Where are they...

282
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,530
Who is it?

283
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,070
It's Min Gyo.

284
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,710
You can't let him in so easily!

285
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,580
- Excuse me, sir!
- You can't let him in!

286
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,510
He had a glass of water!

287
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,690
- No one came to you?
- I sent away four people.

288
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,120
- It doesn't open there, it seems.
- It doesn't.

289
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,460
Grasshopper!
Grasshopper!

290
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,030
Sir!

291
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,630
Min Gyo, it's been a while.
You've gotten handsomer!

292
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,500
Sir, did you just lie?

293
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
- You just lied, right?
- No.

294
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,340
- It's the truth.
- You lied.

295
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,480
Grasshopper, you're handsome too.

296
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,550
[He laughs as he says it.]

297
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,010
You're so charming.

298
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,180
Min Gyo!

299
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,390
Get in the other way.

300
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,490
[They accepted him with sympathy.]

301
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,190
We shouldn't have let him in.

302
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,030
[Min Gyo's taxi has
three passengers.]

303
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,760
Yes, let's go.

304
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,040
More than anything,
Jong Kook's with Su Ro.

305
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,340
That's one of the flaws about Su Ro.

306
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,980
He always wants to win!

307
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,950
How's your competitiveness?

308
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,750
I let you in my taxi.
Can't you tell?

309
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,090
I'm pretty much like Buddha.

310
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,590
<i>Is your group complete?</i>

311
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,090
Yes, yes.

312
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,460
Why? Is our team no good, in your opinion?

313
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,930
We're too weak, right?

314
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,140
But it could be a game
using our brains.

315
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,340
Are you confident
using your brain?

316
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,110
Well, that's true...

317
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,320
We have Big Nose and Big Eyes here.

318
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,150
And my mouth protrudes...

319
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,690
Big Eyes, Big Nose,
and a protruding mouth.

320
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,260
If we photoshop it, wow...

321
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,700
If there's hell,
I bet that would be it.

322
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
If there's hell

323
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,030
it's got to be Big Eyes, Big Nose

324
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,170
and my mouth protrudes.

325
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,140
It's hell!

326
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,880
[And here]

327
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,980
So, the three of us...
Kwang Soo, what's with your face?

328
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,580
No, no.

329
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,150
I thought you were a ghost!

330
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,150
Why are you making that face?

331
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,660
[Why is Kwang Soo here?]

332
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,060
[Kwang Soo went to say hi to Su Ro.]

333
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,430
- What are you doing?
- Get in!

334
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,460
Just get in for a sec!

335
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,430
Yeah, get in.

336
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,300
Hello!

337
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,900
- Get in!
- Kwang Soo changed.

338
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,270
I didn't know it was you!

339
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,940
But I had a lot of difficulty
getting in Bo Ra's taxi...

340
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,280
[I shouldn't have come...]

341
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,350
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

342
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,420
- We'll be a team together.
- Of course.

343
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,350
Let's shout, 'we're one team!'

344
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,920
One, two, three!
We are one team!

345
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,930
[He's about to cry...]

346
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,260
- What's with the camera?
- Ji Hyo!

347
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,470
Kwang Soo

348
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,830
- who's taxi are you in?
- I'm in...

never get off of...

350
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,080
I was in here before
I even knew it.

351
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,680
I'm currently

352
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,810
with Front Su Ro, Right Jong Kook.

353
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,350
And the left door doesn't open.

354
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,190
The left door of the
taxi doesn't open...

355
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,890
[Bye, Ji Hyo.]

356
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,690
[At this moment,
two teams are complete.]

[This man is struggling
with the streets of Yeouido.]

[He's having a tour in a call taxi.]

360
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,140
The navigation just randomly
told me to turn right...

361
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,550
Where, where?
Let's go!

362
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,560
[She lost the guys and found the ace!]

363
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,590

[Gun Hyung, who was lost]

365
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,070
[got Ha Ha who was
thrown away by Bo Ra.]

366
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,670
Wow, this is war!

367
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,010
[An intense chase of anger.]

368
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,210

determine victory.]

Oh, it's Ha Ha!

372
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,990
Hello!

373
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,930
Please open the door!

374
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,830
Get out, get out!

375
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,100
- Get out!
- Wait, wait!

376
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,070

you in 10 years!

[With this, Bo Ra and Ha Ha got in.]

380
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,810
- Gary!
- What?

381
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,450
[Gary also goes in Bo Ra's taxi.]

382
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,750
Hurry, let's go!

383
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,290
[Another team is
complete in a flash.]

384
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,290
[What is this?]

385
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm sorry!
I kind of like this team!

and I finally met you...]

[are on one team, automatically.]

389
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,380
It worked out kind of well.
Our team is pretty good.

390
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,950
Do you guys know each other?

391
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,320
- Yeah, of course.
- Good, it works out.

392
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,590
- Our team is actually good!
- So we're good to go?

393
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,290
Yeah, this is our team.

394
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,830
- Ji Hyo...
- You have to do well, today!

395
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,430
I missed you so much.

396
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,670
Ji Hyo, I missed you so much.

397
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,440
We should have met in a movie.

398
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,240
We need to go now.

399
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,740
[How will this team turn out?]
Turn on the navigator.

400
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,680
I turned it on already.
I'm all ready..

401

[A soccer field
in 'P' University in Seoul.]

402
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,880
We're the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth team.

403
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,190
When our features meet, it's hell.

404
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,420
When his eyes, my nose
and his mouth combines

405
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,960
it's monstrous.

406
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,560
[And here comes the team
that will kill all, today.]

407
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,470
- They're going to win.
- How did they end up together?

408
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,930
Look at their strut.

409
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't care about the other teams,
but we have to win them.

410
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,710
- We have to.
- How did they end up together?

411
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,840
Look at their expression,
and their strut.

412
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,210
They're coming down as
if they already won.

413
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,380
Your team is so gloomy!

414
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,020
[They're dissing them
as soon as they see them.]

415
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,650
This is cheating!

416
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,420
You and Jong Kook on
one team is cheating!

417
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,330
How do we judge all
the power in this world?

418
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,930
Your team is useless.

419
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,200
What's with that team?

420
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,700
- Oh, she's so cute!
- She's so cute!

421
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,300
She's cute!

422
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,210
We're the youngest team!

423
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,910
Violet, you're too much!

424
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,550
That team was the un-chosen team.

425
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,820
The ones that got thrown away.

426
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,350
- Oh, really?
- They got thrown away?

427
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,060
You guys were thrown away!

428
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,690
[What are you talking about?]

429
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,230
- We were destined.
- It's fate.

430
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,500
Ji Hyo is so nice.

431
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,800
She accepted all
the poorly people.

432
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,600
Although it seems so, we've been
friends for for 10 years.

433
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,370
When did you last contact each other?

434
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,970
Ten years ago!

435
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,480
- It's been 10 years, that's why.
- They're friends for 10 years.

436
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,940
Has it really been 10 years?

437
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,880
We were both in Ji Hyo's
debut movie together.

438
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,550
And it's been 10 years since then.

439
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,620
Their team combination is great!

440
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,890
And Sung Min...

441
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,220
Why is only your
lower body so white?

442
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,230
- He's more white than Ji Hyo!
- Why is that?

443

Don't look at the color!

I am very satisfied.

Min Gyo knows nothing
about cheating...

450
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,410
He's too nice.

451
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,880
He picked the first
two people as his team.

452
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,690
You should have
thrown this one out.

453
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,750
What did you say?

454
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,520
[Just kidding]

455
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,830
- You'll get beat up today!
- You know when you curve?

456
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,530
You should have made a
quick curve and thrown him out!

457
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,270
Did you see Suk Jin just now?

458
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,570
He attacked but blocked
at the same time.

- Bulgogi with rice!
- Pork cutlet!

475
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,530
Those kinds of places
have many taxi drivers

476
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,700
so they can't last if
they don't taste good.

477
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,730
It has to be inexpensive
and tastes good.

478
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,940
That's right!

479
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,940

[All their recommendations
are different to their taste.]

the dish that you think is the best

497
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,420

must be the same

If you pick pork cutlet, but the
driver says stir-fried spicy pork

501
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,340
then you have to eat it.

502
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,710
And then you take another cab.

503
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,640
You have to go around until
you eat what you picked.

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,290
There's nothing bad!

523
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,760
The patties aren't in the top ten!

524
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,830
There's no chance of winning.

525
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,830
And?

526
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,100
- The wraps aren't in top 20.
- I love it...

527
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,460
It doesn't matter if we do!

528
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:13,240
Kimchi stew is
in the top five for sure!

529
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,270
Pork cutlet as well!

530
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,310
Isn't pork cutlet a little hard?

531
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,910
It's very possible because
it comes with soup on the side.

532
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,980
You have to think
about the nutrients.

533
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,950
[A very elaboated analysis.]

534
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,920
He's one of the people who
pronounces soup the old way.

535
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,060
Soup!

536
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,320
What do you think, Low White?

537
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,960
Who's Low White?

538
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Kang Sung Jin.

539
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,200
[Low White: Lower body is white.]

540
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,700
I would like to give points
to the grilled fish, actually.

541
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,540
You can't give it points!

542
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,510
What points?

543
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,880
I will give it 100 points!

544
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,980
[He gives out 100 points.]
('White' and 'Hundred' sound the same)

545
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,180
I personally think the
wraps are number one...

546
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,280
No, it's risky.

547
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,120
What's wrong with you?

548
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,620
It's not about what you want!

549
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,660
Have some common sense!

550
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,130
[So that's what happens
if you're with them...]

551
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,590
- Wraps?
- It started already.

552
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,730
Why on earth did you think that?

553
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,970
At this rate, you'll be dead meat.

554
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,330
If you say something wrong...

555
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,170
Let's go eat
delicious meals today.

556
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,170
Let's have a tour today.

557
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,170
[Will I be able to
get through, today?]

558
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,380
This game is called bumball.

559
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,980
- It is being played as a sport.
- It actually exists?

560
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,080
You have to have the ball

561
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,350
without holding it
with your hands.

562
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,890
You can only attach it
on your chest and bottom.

563
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,320
In each goal zone,
there are Velcros.

564
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,460
You need to attach the ball
on the Velcro to get a point.

565
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,920
[The young blood
vs. the old friends team.]

566
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,170
[There's so much tension
on the battlefield.]

567
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,740
[The first round is to get the
priority for picking a dish.]

568
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,210
[How the female players do
are the biggest variable.]

569
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,210
[Who will get to choose first?]

570
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,980
Ready, set!

571
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,080
[Game start!]

572
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,880
[As soon as the game starts,
Gun Hyung gets the ball.]

573
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,180
[I want to steal it!]

574
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,850
Give it to me!

575
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,720
Ji Hyo, run!

576
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,560
[You can only attach the ball
with your chest or bum.]

577
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,100
[Blank Ji attaches it on her chest.]

578
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,160
I can't grab it...

579
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,870
How can we take it away?

580
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,100
Take it!

581
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,070
Go near their goal!

582
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,410
[They plan to pass it right
in front of the goal.]

583
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,810
Catch it!

584
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,280
[But Gary steals it quickly.]

585
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,220
[Hug]

586
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,990
[Na-na-na boo boo!]

587
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,460
[What are you doing, Ji Hyo?]

588
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,630
[Love follows the bumball.]

589
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,130
What are you doing?

590
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,070
[The audience stirred as
they hold a romantic pose.]

591
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,400
You can take the ball with your hand.

592
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,370
[Monday Couple ignore the rule
and communicating physically.]

593
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,110
Throw it!

594
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,810
[Are you leaving already?]

595
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,380
[It was a short moment,
but I was happy.]

596
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,550
[Gun Hyung quickly attacks.]

597
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,450
[No mercy!]

598
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,450
Gun Hyung, you shouldn't do that!

599
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,990
Gun Hyung is incredible.

600
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,460
He doesn't care about his image.

601
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,720
[Bo Ra doesn't let it go.]

602
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,920
Do I still have it?

603
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,690
Run, Bo Ra!

604
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,130
[She's heading to her team's goal.]

605
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,000
Steal it and lie down!

606
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,540
[If she lies down,
she'll score an own goal...]

607
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Can I just lie down?

608
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,310
[Team Old Friends goes to finals.]

609
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,180
They won.

610
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,250
Isn't that her own goal?

611
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,890
The ball didn't touch the Velcro!

612
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,360
- Bo Ra was supposed to go over there.
- But they didn't put the ball on it.

613
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,660
[I'm burned out.]

614
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,160
[Team Eyes, Nose, and Mouth
vs. Team Strongest]

615
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,870
We need to do it fast.

616
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,740
Kim Jong Kook, please don't
grab the opponents' clothes.

617
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,170
You're not allowed to do that.

618
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,870
It'll be too painful, because
I need to grab their skin.

619
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,770
What did you say?

620
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,810
I might grab your ribs.

621
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,410
Or the collarbone!

622
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,620
- This is frustrating.
- Wait for me, Jong Kook!

623
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,390
He can actually do it.

624
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,260
It's upsetting but
what can you say?

625
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,790
Ready!
[Which team will go to the finals?]

626
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,790
Start!
[Which team will go to the finals?]

627
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,500
[The game starts.]

628
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,770
[It's intense from the beginning.]

629
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,200
[Min Gyo tries stealing the ball.]

630
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,840
[How dare you!]

631
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,840
[Su Ro is blocking two people.]

632
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,610
[What is Kwang Soo doing?]

633
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,410
[He attaches the ball
on his bum slowly.]

634
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,280
What a nice strategy!

635
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,550
Run!
You need to run!

636
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,660
[It's hot.
I don't want to run.]

637
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,600
[While the weak
opponents are struggling]

638
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,800
[Giraffe casually walks to their goal.]

639
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,300
[Team Strongest goes to the finals.]

640
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,340
What was that?

641
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,610
It's is upsetting!

642
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,310
I hurt my pride.

643
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,080
[They're enjoying the victory.]

644
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,980
Sometimes, you need to
enjoy victory, Kwang Soo.

645
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,420
Who made this game?

646
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,390
[I won't forget this humiliation.]

647
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,320
It's not possible to win over them.

648
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,630
[Team Strongest vs. Team Old Ffriends]

649
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,400
It's obvious that team
has an advantage.

650
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,170
[The strongest team's
competitiveness is at its peak.]

651
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,370
What are we going to do?

652
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,340
Ji Hyo, walk casually and grab it.

653
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,970
[The vanguard attack, Blank Ji!]

654
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,150
I think Ji Hyo will
spring out at the ball.

655
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,380
Block Gun Hyung and Min Gyo.

656
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,350
[Mr. Capable sees
through their tactics.]

657
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,020
First grab their arms...

658
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,750
[The dish selection is
riding on this game!]

659
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,450
[Who will be able to
pick the first dish?]

660
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,620
It's a single round match!

661
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,290
[Bumball finals start!]

662
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,000
[Both teams rush as
soon as whistle blows!]

663
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,300
[He carries Blank Ji
and runs to their goal.]

664
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,470
[What kind of strategy is it?]

665
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,110
[Ji Hyo, you will also
score your own goal.]

666
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,180
[Hurry up, Su Ro!]

667
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,350
[A sweet and scary run]

668
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,060
[The strongest acquires the
priority to pick a dish.]

669
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,660
[Total wreck]

670
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,260
[Victory is sweet!]

671
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,770
What's this?

672
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,770
- It's frustrating!
- It is!

673
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,770
[Look!
This is the scream of winners!]

674
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,210
[We're the real strongest.]

675
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,280
[Acquired the priority
to pick the dish]

676
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,320
Send this team for an
international competition.

677
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,620
We can only pick one dish, right?

678
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,960
- Just one.
- And we need to eat until they say it.

679
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Until they say what we pick.

680
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,260
We can end it at once if we pick bulgogi
with rice and the driver says it.

681
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,570
Stir-pork?

682
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,670
That might not be it.

683
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,100
Think carefully,
it could be something else.

684
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,210
I think it's some kind of soup.

685
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,710
Something ordinary like kimchi stew
or soy bean paste soup.

686
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,880
Seriously...

687
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,390
When are you going to pick your dish?

688
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,420
If you're not going to pick one,
the next team will pick it first.

689
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,860
You can eat the stew
if you think that's it.

690
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,830
I don't think it's kimchi stew or
bean paste soup.

691
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,630
Five, four, three!

692
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,570
- Two!
- Wait a moment!

693
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,510
[It's time to decide!]

694
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,140
- Bulgogi with rice?
- Wait a moment!

695
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,310
Bulgogi with rice?

696
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,100
[The dish taxi drivers would recommend]

697
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,550

- How about curried rice?
- Kimchi stew is okay, too.

00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,570
- For young people like us...
- The dish is?

1046
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,340
One, two, three!

1047
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,740
[A dish that young people
like us would enjoy.]

1048
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,240
[The crispy and crunchy dish...]

1049
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,680
Stir-fried pork!

1050
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,950
[Youngsters enjoy
stir-friend pork!]

1051
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:58,190
Sir, did you mean the
pork bulgogi with rice?

1052
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:01,520
- Yes!
- Kimchi stew...

1053
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,460
Pork bulgogi with rice...

1054
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,430
I could eat up to this.

1055
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,800
It'll be good.

1056
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,530
- We could eat...
- But!

1057
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,570
I don't think anyone would
recommend pork cutlet!

1058
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,900
How are we going to pay
for the social dinner?

1059
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,540
If we picked Kimchi stew,
it would have been better...

1060
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,980
I thought I could eat
least two meals...

1061
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,950
But after the watermelon, I'm done!

1062
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,120
I could have ate two meals!

1063
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,020
I'm done eating for the day...

1064
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,690
And we'll conclude it with
a bowl of ox bone soup...

1065
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,330
If we succeed,
I'd gratefully eat that...

1066
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,490
It's here!

1067
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,260
I have a feeling it's ox bone soup!

1068
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,230
[Their second try for ox bone soup]

1069
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,940
[and the results?]

1070
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,070
I really enjoyed
that stir-fried pork!

1071
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:55,710
Sir, we will be giving you a question
so all you have to do is answer us.

1072
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,410
One, two, three!

1073
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:01,920
Please recommend us
a taxi driver's dish!

1074
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,550
[After eating stir-friend pork, there's
only one thing that comes to mind!]

1075
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,660
[An excellent dish known
for its white color.]

1076
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:15,460
Squid bulgogi!

1077
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,370
Squid bulgogi, it is!

1078
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:24,200
- Would you know where it is?
- Okay, please take us there!

1079
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,170
Okay, thank you!

1080
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,710
Yes, we will head there.

1081
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,750
Sir, do you think anyone
would say ox bone soup?

1082
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,980
It's a little hard...

1083
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,880
[Flustered, flustered]

1084
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,850
It's usually stir-fried pork
or bulgogi with rice, right?

1085
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,920
Yes!

1086
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,060
[The top two are bulgogi with
rice and stir-fried pork.]

1087
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:52,060
If you get 10 taxi drivers and
ask them what they had today

1088
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,630
no one will say ox bone soup.

1089
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,540
You are so right!

1090
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,300
Don't say that...

1091
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,770
We'll see...

1092
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,480
If you want to find a driver
who eats ox bone soup

1093
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,180
- go to Shingil-dong.
- Shingil-dong?

1094
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,980
Is Shingil-dong better?

1095
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,920
There's famous ox bone
soup restaurant there.

1096
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,490
Many taxi drivers go there.

1097
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,330
If anything...

1098
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,930
we'll get a call taxi...

1099
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,600
And we'll ask them for a
driver who likes ox bone soup.

1100
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,270
- A call taxi?
- That's a good idea.

1101
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,670
- If nothing works out.
- Yeah, yeah.

1102
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,270
It's here.

1103
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:37,110
Oh, it's here?

1104
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,640
Across the street?

1105
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,780
They have spicy pork
with rice here, as well!

1106
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,780
[They arrived at the
squid bulgogi restaurant.]

1107
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,680
Spicy pork with rice...

1108
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,890
- Hello!
- Hello!

1109
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,260
Could we get three
squid bulgogi?

1110

[Spicy pork with rice]

1111
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,260
Sir!
Have you, by any chance

1112
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,130
had ox bone soup at
a taxi driver's restaurant?

1113
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,630
- Yes!
- You've had it before?

1114
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,270
- Ox bone soup?
- Yes.

1115
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,600
Where?

1116
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,610
- Which area?
- Shingil-dong!

1117
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,180
That's the place our
driver recommended!

1118
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,950
If we tell the driver Shingil-dong,
there's a possibility.

1119
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,150
[Forget about ox bone soup for now]

1120
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,680
[and enjoy your squid bulgogi!]

1121
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:26,250
- What singer?
- It is a singer!

1122
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,720
He's not a singer!

1123
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,330
[What's this?]

1124
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,600
Kim Jong Kook,
you're not a singer right?

1125
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,830
Ma'am!

1126
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,840
I am a singer!

1127
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,510
[I've been a singer for 20 years.]

1128
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:48,110
You know, 'One man', or 'Lovely'?

1129
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:53,110
<i>Wow, everything of you
from head to toe is lovable!</i>

1130
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,980
You don't know it?

1131
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,980
[I'm so embarrassed...]

1132
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,020
- You know it, right?
- She had a huge argument over there.

1133
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,920
'No, he's a singer.'
'No, he's an athlete.'

1134
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,460
I know him, though.

1135
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,190
I know Kim Suro, well.

1136
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,930
I seem him on TV all the time.

1137
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,760
Well Giraffe is on TV a lot, too!

1138
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,400
[He's not an actor,
nor a model but a giraffe.]

1139
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,970
Thank you.

1140
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,770
I found out today
that you're a singer!

1141
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,010
This is year is my
20th anniversary!

1142
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,640
As a singer!

1143
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,280
[Embarrassed]

1144
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,080
Long time ago, Kim Bo Sung came...

1145
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,080
but he was really handsome,
like a celebrity!

1146
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,150
['Kim Bo Sung looked
like a celebrity.']

1147
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,490
[Then what about us...]

1148
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,820
What about us?

1149
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,030
It's because we
were running around!

1150
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,560
Your faces are so tanned!

1151
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,230
It's because my
makeup's been erased!

1152
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,830
Kim Bo Sung wore a trench coat!

1153
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,670
- He was super cool!
- I have a trench coat, too!

1154
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:55,340
Although we have name tags on, now...

1155
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,740
If we wore sunglasses,
we would look cool!

1156
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,810
I wear a trench coat
when I go to bed!

1157
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,450
Thank you, thank you!

1158
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,190
[They finished eating
grilled pork belly.]

1159
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,460
Taxi, taxi, taxi!

1160
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,230
Please recommend us a dish!

[Will they be able to
hear 'bulgogi with rice'?]

1162

Out of all the dishes

1163
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:26,170
could you recommend
something you eat often?

1164
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:28,510
One, two, three!

1165
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:37,310
[You know,
the dish taxi drivers love...]

1166
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,420
Pork bulgogi with rice.

1167
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,490
[We finally got it!]

1168
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:48,760
[They succeeded in two tries!]

1169
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,930
Oh my god, thank you so much!

1170

You're the best!

1171
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,200
- You're the best!
- In which area?

1172
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,540
- Banghwa-dong.
- Banghwa-dong?

1173
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,040
[The driver suggested
Banghwa-dong.]

1174
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,240
So, the other teams...
what did they...

1175
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,180
Some teams went
to eat pork cutlet

1176
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,550
- another went for ox bone soup.
- That's pretty rare.

1177
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,080
They have the wrong idea.

1178
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,020
You know Lee Kwang Soo?
He went to eat that.

1179
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,990
Yeah, he would pick it...

1180
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,490
- That was good.
- A taxi!

1181
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,000
Isn't there one over there?

1182
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,130
The front one or the back?

1183
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,730
The back!

1184
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,740
There's someone in there.

1185
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,310
- Is it empty?
- Could we get a ride?

1186
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,880
Sir!

1187
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,840
Are you leaving now?

1188
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,750

hear stir-fried pork?]

We will give you a question,
so you just have to answer.

1191
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,690
Please give us an answer on three.

01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,930
[Please say stir-fried pork]

01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,800
[instead of bulgogi with rice.]

1196

Stir-fried pork!

1197
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,770
[They got stir-fried pork!]

1198

Today is our day!

1206

- Should we ride that?
- Which one?

1207
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,900
It's not an empty taxi.

1208
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,400
I have a good feeling
about this one!

1209
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,410
- This car?
- I have a good feeling!

1210
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,470
I have a good feeling!

1211
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,910
- Hello.
- Sir, hello!

the Namsan cable car.

1216
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,030
- Where?
- Namsan.

1217
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:11,830
What is a dish that you
would recommend to us

1218
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:16,370
- in Namsan?
- One, two, three!

1219
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:23,710
[The crispy dish famous in Namsan...]

1220
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:26,110
One, two, three!

1221
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,110
Pork cutlet!

1222
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:31,420
[They got pork cutlet!]

1223
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,920
Please depart!

1224
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,220
Yeah!

1225
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,700
You're the best!

1226
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:48,500
[They succeeded in three tries!]

1227
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,570
[They finished
their bulgogi and rice.]

1228
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:54,240
Wow, thank you for the coffee!

1229
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,770
[Touched, touched]

1230
01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:00,080
You saw just now, right?
Taxi driver restaurants are awesome.

1231
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,680
I want to come here with my family.

1232
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,280
It came, it came!

1233
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,090
[The location of the social dinner!]

1234
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:10,790
'S' Garden

1235
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,060
Hannam-dong.

1236
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,260
If it's a garden,
there's going to be meat.

1237
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,030
I'm so full already!

1238
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,300
I'm stuffed!

1239
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,800
Let's just go anyway.

1240
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,800
- It's rush hour!
- Yeah, so we have to go.

1241
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,300
It's going to take an hour, right?

1242
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,910
[They've finished their dish.]

1243
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,610
I can't eat any more.

1244
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:38,520
[But they've finished all of it.]

1245
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,520
You have a message.

1246
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,650
What is it?
Read it for me.

1247
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,360
The restaurant for the social
dinner is 'S' restaurant

1248
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,520
in Hannam-dong, Yongsan-go...

1249
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,760
That's the address.

1250
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,360
- Hannam-dong?
- We can just go now.

1251
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:56,770
We're too full, so we won't
be able to eat with them.

1252
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,000
I want to eat since
the last team will pay.

1253
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,440
[Big-nosed brother wants to
eat everything that's free.]

1254
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:06,710
[The strongest team
finished pork bulgogi.]

1255
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,310
Let's get the taxi.

1256
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,510
[Their fourth taxi]

1257
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,350
Can you tell us a dish?

1258
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,850
When you come to Shingil-dong

1259
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,690
there are many restaurants
in other places

1260
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:25,500
but in Shingil-dong, what's the dish
you want to recommend?

1261
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,370
Because we're already in Shingil-dong.

1262
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,440
You can tell us.

1263
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,070
- Can you think of anything?
- Maybe with some soup.

1264
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,140
[The famous dish in Shingil-dong]

1265
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:45,050
[Will he say ox bone soup?]

1266
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,080
[Please...]

1267
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,990
Chicken soup with ginseng...

1268
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:55,690
[Chicken soup with ginseng?]

1269
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:59,230
[Did I say something wrong?]

1270
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:03,460
[Disappointed]

1271
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,870
- Where's the ox bone soup restaurant?
- It's over that side.

1272
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,840
He answered instantly.

1273
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:14,010
[They've gone to everywhere
except the right one.]

1274
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,010
Thank you.

1275
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,150
[They arrived at the restaurant
for chicken soup.]

1276
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,180
[They're not even upset any longer.]

1277
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,590
But this was the most
similar dish of all.

1278
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,650
Yes, it's soup.

1279
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,590
It might taste the same
if you eat it with your eyes closed.

1280
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:41,070
Let's go to the main restaurant.

1281
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,300
They have two building.

1282
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,840
This is a really mean game.

1283
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,110
If this was our first dish...

1284
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,510
They have three restaurants.

1285
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,950
This must be very famous.

1286
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,520
And they don't have any seats.

1287
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,490
Can we take out?

1288
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,290
- Yes, you can.
- Then we'll take it.

1289
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,830
We can't even eat it
in the restaurant.

1290
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:07,920
Let's just eat it on the street.

1291
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,530
This is a good spot.

1292
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:14,930
Let's just sit here and eat.

1293
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,700
Wow, the smell of pork cutlet!

1294
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,210
[How does the pork cutlet taste?]

1295
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,610
Wow, it's crunchy!

1296
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,780
It's good!

1297
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,780
[The taste is like a miracle.]

1298
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,380
I actually like it very much.

1299
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,050
I wonder if they're
eating ox bone soup.

1300
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,720
I worry about them.

1301
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,430
[Team Young Bloods is relaxed.]

1302
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,300
[The strongest team looks pathetic.]

1303
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,070
- Let's eat.
- Open it.

1304
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,370
The broth...

1305
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:52,000
it's different from other restaurant.

1306
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,970
Should we just taste the broth?

1307
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:57,440
[The broth looks very rich.]

1308
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,510
Wow!

1309
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,320
It's really good!

1310
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,290
Do you want to eat
some chicken breast?

1311
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,560
Just the chicken breast.

1312
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,360
Do you want to shut up
or get beat up?

1313
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,990
I would shut up.

1314
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,830
Hurry up and eat, Kwang Soo.

1315
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:24,000
Ha Ha!

1316
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,500
Are pork-cutlet good?

1317
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,110
How about your dish?

1318
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,770
You haven't eaten it?

1319
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,910
No, we're about to go.

1320
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:34,210
Take it easy.

1321
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,110
- We're in Gapyung.
- What?

1322
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,680
Ga..pyung?

1323
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,250
It's where Bae Yeon Jung's
restaurant is.

1324
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,760
<i>Yes, it's right next door.</i>

1325
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:51,060
There's traffic, take your time.

1326
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,100
I see, Su Ro.

1327
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,630
We're about to leave from Gapyung.

1328
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,730
Okay, I see.

1329
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,800
I see, bye!

1330
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,370
That's really funny!

1331
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,570
Gapyung is too far.

1332
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,870
I need to make them relieved.

1333
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,780
But the game isn't over yet!

1334
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,610
[Giraffe finished it all by himself.]

1335
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,450
- You're done?
- Let's go.

1336
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,420
He finished it.

1337
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,620
We're getting a message.

1338
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,190
Yes, we got it.

1339
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:19,990
Hannam-dong in Yongsan-go!

1340
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,460
It's really close from here.

1341
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,030
Isn't it right next to this place?

1342
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,030
We could walk there, right?

1343
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,130
Wow, how could it be Hannam-dong?

1344
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
Wow, this team is very lucky!

1345
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,100
[Will they be able to
laugh until the end?]

1346
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,770
This is unbelievable!

mouth team arrive.]

1354

Help yourselves!

1355
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,500
[What's that?]

1356
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,300
[The applause from 150 people...]

1357
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,600
[It feels weird...]
Eat a lot.

1358
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,200
We're not the last, aren't we?

1359
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,370
You are... not the last.

1360

Oh, no, Su Ro!

1361

[They start worrying about others.]

1362
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:22,180
[Huh? What's the matter?]

1363
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,080
[Team Old Friends arrived
first and they waited.]

1364
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,460
What was your dish?

1365
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,820
It was pork bulgogi with rice.

1366
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,390
That's really popular!

1367
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,330
You can either go home or eat here.

1368
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,460
I understand.
Thank you for your hard work!

1369

There's a taxi.

1373

[Giraffe wants to run to the taxi.]

1374
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,610
Wait, let's think of a plan.

1375
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,520
What are you going to ask?

1376
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,880
[Su Ro stopped out of surprise!]

1377
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:01,650
[Why?]

1378
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,520
[What did he see?]

1379
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:10,800
[Oh, my god!]
[It's an ox bone soup restaurant!]

1380
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,970
[It's in front of us!]

1381
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,410
[He bravely chose ox bone soup,
but the reality was...]

1382
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,970
[favorable for stir-fried pork,
fried squid, pork bulgogi with rice]

1383
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,610
[and chicken soup with ginseng.]

1384

[Eat, eat and eat...]

1385
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,620
[They have tasted food and humiliation.]
[It was such a long day.]

1386
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,720
Point the restaurant.

1387
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,130
If the cab driver recommend
the ox bone soup...

1388
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,930
Just point at the restaurant.

1389
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,630
Sir!

1390
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:51,730
Excuse us!

1391
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,240
Please recommend us a dish.

1392
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,900
[Will it be ox bone soup or not?]

1393
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:07,080
Their ox bone soup is good.

1394
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,350
[Ox bone soup!]

1395
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,220
He said it's good.
We didn't even point it.

1396
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:16,490
We did nothing to make him say it.

1397
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,900
He actually said it right away.

1398
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,600
It's real!

1399
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,730
[Okay, we'll let it pass.]
What did I say?

1400
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,600
What did I tell you?

1401
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,570
Ox bone soup is the
drivers' favorite dish!

1402
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:33,780
Let's sit at the corner.

1403
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,910
[Black pepper spread
like stars on the milky way.]

1404
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:38,310
I really wanted to eat it.

1405
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,150
Our mission for the game was

1406
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:43,750
to get a recommendation
from a taxi cab driver.

1407
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,250
What do you think the
most popular dish is?

1408
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,690
It's ox bone soup.

1409
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,690
[Giraffe meets his soulmate.]

1410
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:57,690
They keep saying they
don't have ox bone soup.

1411
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,470
I'm a fan of yours.

1412
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:02,240
[Displeased]

1413
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,310
We should have met him earlier.

1414
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,010
It's really good!

1415
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,180
It was a nice meal.

1416
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,320
- What place do you think you will win?
- The first place.

1417
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,920
I don't think we're the second even.

1418
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,460
[Team Young Bloods
is still relaxed.]

1419
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,230
I'm done.
Let's go.

1420
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:28,600
[Their mission that looked impossible
to complete was accomplished!]

1421
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,930
I've got a message.

1422
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:34,330
It's the address of the restaurant.

1423
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,840
It's in Hannam-dong!

1424
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,740
Let's go.
Hurry up!

1425
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,040
[Team Strongest leaves in a hurry.]

1426
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,980
Now I see.

1427
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,580
Ox bone soup wasn't that popular...

1428
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,520
Say it correctly.
It's not that.

1429
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,820
It's hard to find it
at drivers' restaurant.

1430
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,560
I admit it.
It was my bad.

1431
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,990
[The young blood vs. the strongest]

1432
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,260
[Who will end up in last place?]

1433
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,600
[The last mission site]
['S' restaurant in Hannam-dong]

1434
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,430
Are we the last?

1435
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:07,170
[Anxious]
Let's go.

1436
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,340
We don't know the result yet.

1437
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,000
Maybe there's another team

1438
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,640
[Another taxi arrives.]

1439
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,940
- It's on the third floor.
- Right here?

1440
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:18,940
We might be the last.

1441
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,010
Are we the last?
No way!

1442
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,750
[Team Young Bloods
was relaxed for the whole time.]

1443
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,020
What's going on?

1444
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:30,020
[The strongest team
who was pressed for time]

1445
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,620
Are we the last?

1446
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:36,430
[A round of applause
for the young blood team...]

1447
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,460
[No way...]

1448
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,690
[What's the meaning of the applause?]

1449
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,770
We place the last?

1450
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,640
Are we the last?

1451
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,510
You are, out of four teams,

1452
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,610
[No way...]

1453
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,440
[we're the last team?]

1454
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,050
Our of four teams

1455
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,110
you're not last place.

1456
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,550
[Not last place]

1457
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:03,790
You can go home now.

1458
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,760
Enjoy your meal!

1459
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,660
[Then it means...]
Are we the last?

1460
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:14,030
- Where is everyone?
- They've finished eating.

1461
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:16,170
[Absurd]

1462
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:20,370
The people who finished
eating went home

1463
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,910
They ate and left?

1464
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,580
Since it was social dinner,
they ate and left.

1465
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,120
We've had a social dinner all together.
Thank you.

1466
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,050
Thank Kwang Soo.

1467
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,850
- We're really the last team?
- Yes, you arrived here the last.

1468
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,390
Congratulations, Kwang Soo!

1469
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:43,890
As the rule, one of you
will pay for the dinner.

1470
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,360
Take your name tag on your back

1471
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,030
- and put it on the rullet.
- It's not decided yet!

1472
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:54,270
I'm going to pay with
your credit card anyway.

1473
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:58,210
You're not supposed to decide that!

1474
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:01,780
Wow, you've worked so hard!

1475
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,710
[They've waited to see
the funny scene.]

1476
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,480
When did you arrive?

1477
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,520
The ox bone soup was...

1478
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,790
- it was a bad mistake.
- Did you eat a lot of dish?

1479
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,720
Yes, we did eat a lot.

1480
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,930
We'll film until the moment
the person pays.

1481
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:23,170
Please, check the name
on the card, too.

1482
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:26,700
Do you see on the other side?

1483
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,600
There are people eating still.

1484
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,010
Stop eating so much!

1485
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,040
We'll rotate the rullet, then.

1486
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,010
Please, rotate it, Bo Ra.

1487
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,850
Rotate it, Bora!

1488
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,420
[Worried]

1489
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,550
When it's decided, we'll leave.

1490
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,950
One, two, three!

1491
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,360
Rotate!

1492
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,660
[Please, don't stop at my name...]

1493
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,400
[They're nervous, too.]

1494
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:02,040
[The rullet gets slow.]

1495
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,980
[Kkuk?]
[Kwang Soo?]

1496
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,210

[Who will pay for the dinner?]

1498
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,550
It's Jong Kook!

1499
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,920
[Giraffe runs out of joy!]

1500
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,930
[A gloomy foreboding
always come true.]

1501
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,560
[It's not me!]

1502
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,830
Jong Kook looks really upset.

1503
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,700
[He pretends it's okay,
but he's heated up.]

1504
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,600
[As they promised,
they leave the site.]

1505
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:43,310
You are the main player for this race!

1506
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:46,750
[Don't be sad, we love you! (meats)]

1507
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,250
- Bye!
- See you tomorrow!

1508
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,850
Okay, see you.

1509
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:55,290
Ah... this drives me nuts.

1510
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,820
Let's go to pay.

1511
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,560
[It's time to pay.]

1512
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,160
What are you doing here?

1513
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,060
Why don't you sign on the invoice?

1514
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,330
Sign on the receipt!

1515
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,200
[Thank you, Kwang Soo!]

1516
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,600
How much it is?

1517
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,310
[Even Mr. Capable
is scared of the receipt.]

1518
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:21,750
[She's calculating.]
Don't they give a discount like 1,000 won?

1519
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,610
That much, I can handle it.

1520
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,350
[Minus 1,000 won]

1521
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,290
[The total amount is... jaw-dropping!]

1522
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,190
She gave me 1,000 won discount.

1523
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:40,960
That's like 0.1 percent discount.

1524
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,900
Thank you, Jong Kook.

1525
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,870
You can go home.

1526
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:49,060
You'll be able to make
a lot more than this.
