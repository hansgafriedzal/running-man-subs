00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,730
- X-Teen works, too...
- And Smurf.

177
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,410
[There's Leessang, why are you
bringing up the past...]

178
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,950
Those count.

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,550
So, does it count if
they say 'Lee Sung Kyung'?

180
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,800
Pardon?

181
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,150
Their love will never die?

182
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,620
[I should just be quiet...]

183
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,410
When you're done,
you come back upstairs.

184
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,080
You'll feel a little upset
if you succeed though.

185
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,180
Was I only worth this much?

186
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,130
They don't really stare
at convenience stores.

187
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,100
But more than your face

188
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,570
- they recognize your voice.
- My voice is slightly noticeable.

189
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,670
That's true.
You shouldn't talk.

190
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,310
[He changed his voice,
but it's a fail...]

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,940
Say, 'It's 4,500 won.'

192
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,640
- It's 4,500 won, hello.
- That's it.

193
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,440
[That's more suspicious...]

194
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,040
People really don't know me.

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,920
They don't know that it's Lee Dong Wook,
they usually say 'Lee Dong Gook.'

196
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,220
I'm serious.

197
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,890
No way!
Dong Wook!

198
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,990
[Who will win
the convenience store mission?]

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
[Kim Jong Kook, Ha Ha, Lee Kwang Soo vs.
Ji Suk Jin, Lee Dong Wook, Yoo Jae Suk]

200
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,310
Which one of the three will go first?

201
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm the least noticeable one, right?

202
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,770
Your arm...

203
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,650
[His muscles are too big
for scanning bar-codes.]

204
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,650
I could just be someone
who likes to work out!

205
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,950
Up to a certain point!

206
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,020
[He's too crazy about working out.]

207
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,520
[First challenger, Kkuk!]

208
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,420
He's going down.

209
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,790
He's already suspicious!

210
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,170
His walk is already suspicious!

211
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,970
[He arrived at the cash register.]

212
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,810
[His first time working part-time]

213
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,870
[at a convenience store.]

214
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,990
- How do I scan?
- First, press this.

215
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,180
[Just then, two female
customers arrived!]

216
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,190
[The first customers' visit
made him nervous.]

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,990
[He puffs his cheeks up so
that they don't recognize him.]

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,370
[Sigh]

219
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,330
[While the two customers
are picking their items...]

220
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,100
You have to act natural.

221
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,400
You don't want them to...

222
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,240
[He's blabbering out of nervousness.]
He's too obvious!

223
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,170
Why does he have
his hands in his pockets?

224
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,410
His hands are awkward.

225
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,910
Just pick your nose instead!

226
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,120
It's just Jong Kook.
But if the customers don't look up...

227
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,060
They can't imagine that
a celebrity will be here.

228
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,260
He's acting so weird!

229
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,470
[Awkward, awkward]

230
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,580
[I'm so nervous.]

231
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,650
Don't cross your arms!

232
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,650
He thinks that he's being casual!

233
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,310
[I'm doing a good job...]

234
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,350
[It's finally check-out time.]

235
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,850
[The distance between
them is fifty centimeters.]

236
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,950
[Will Kkuk be able to handle
the situation, casually?]

237
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,920
[Puff]

238
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,830
[They place the items on the counter,
without any suspicion.]

239
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,930
Please call his name!

240
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,300
They might see his arms

241
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,830
and be too scared to look up.

242
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,610
[Just then, she lifts her head up!]

243
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,950
[All eyes are on him.]

244
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,450
[He scans the bar-codes
without looking up.]

245
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:03,550
[Will Kkuk fail the mission?]

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,780
[Did she recognize Kkuk?]

247
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,580
[She didn't!]

248
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,080
She should have seen him!

249
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,150
Jong Kook can't scan well.

250
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,180
[Scrambling]

251
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,750
Would you like a bag?

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,470
That will be 8,900 won.

253
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,780
[He should have said
something after scanning.]

254
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,180
He's not talking at all!

255
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,110
[He isn't talking just
in case he gets caught.]

256
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,380
Thank you, come again.

257
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,420
[Eventually, they never found out!]

258
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,220
They didn't recognize him!

259
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,450
[Kkuk passed with his first customer.]

260
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,290
That's cheating!

261
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,960
They usually look at
the items or the scanner.

262
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,140
- They don't look at the person.
- I'm like that too.

263
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,200
[Just then!
The second customer is approaching!]

264
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,400
[He approaches without hesitation.]

265
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,580
[He doesn't look.]

266
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,770
I think the other employee
is doing very well.

267
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,010
[Thanks to his over-friendly co-worker]

268
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,120
[Kkuk doesn't have to say a word.]

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,450
[He doesn't stare during the check-out]

270
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,480
[or so we thought!]

271
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,770
[His eyes are fixed on Kkuk!]

272
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,990
[Does Kkuk's challenge end, here?]

273
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,030
[He takes his change and leaves.]

274
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,020
[He lets out a big breath
as soon as he leaves.]

275
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,080
It's good, there's a possibility.

276
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,010
Wow, this is so interesting.

277
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,750
[He finally catches a breath.]

278
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,010
[And another customer walks in, but...]

279
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,510
It's a foreigner!

280
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,130
Wow...

281
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,050
[He's so lucky...]

282
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,990
It's foreigner.
Thank goodness.

283
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,520
Hi!

284
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,850
[He's fixing his hat?]

285
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,680
[Full of confidence]

286
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,910
[He gets a point for free.]

287
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,410
[Huh?
He's laughing?]

288
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,410
- I think he recognized him!
- Why did he lift his hat up?

289
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,150
[But it's still a foreigner...]

290
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,410
[He can't possibly recognize him...]

291
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,750
- It'll be 5,300 won.
- Yes.

292
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,480
Oh, he can speak Korean?

293
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,580
[You can tell he has a lot
of experience just by his 'yes.']

294
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,850
- Do you know how to speak Korean?
- Yes.

295
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,410
[He immediately lowered his hat.]

296
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,410
[He pushes his hat down.]

297
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,280
[Scramble, scramble]

298
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,160
[Is he taking a picture
with his phone?]

299
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,610
- He needs to take it!
- He's out as soon as he takes it!

300
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,380
He's flustered!

301
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,710
Have a nice day!

302
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,780
- Bye.
- Let's take a picture.

303
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,270
[He got caught!]

304
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,750
Yay! He was careless!

305
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,150
One moment of carelessness and he failed!

306
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,050
Pic... picture...

307
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,080
Just take the picture!
Of course.

308
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,150
[It's not a fail because
he didn't say his name?]

309
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,980
One, two, three.

310
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,370
[From his pronunciation to his
selfie pose, he's just so Korean...]

311
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,980
- Fail!
- He didn't say my name!

312
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,390
You're Kim Jong Kook, right?

313
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,480
[The foreigner cleared up
the entire situation.]

314
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,250
How did you know?
Do you work around here?

315
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,650
What kind of work do you do?

316
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,750
- I work at a company.
- Really? You speak so fluently.

317
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,810
All right, thank you.

318
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,980
[Kkuk, fail]

319
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,380
What were you doing?

320
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,150
[Mr. Capable's shoulders look shabby.]

321
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,810
[Ashamed]

322
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,550
All foreigners in Gangnam speak Korean.

323
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,710
I was so surprised.

324
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,980
[Who knew he would be better
at Korean than Kwang Soo...]

325
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,980
I was trying to make it funnier because
he was a foreigner, but he kept laughing.

326
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,550
- Good job.
- He had his camera out.

327
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

328
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,180
Good job!
I'm so glad!

329
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,850
I said, 'He didn't say my name!'

330
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,250
and he comes back and asks,
'You're Kim Jong Kook, right?'

331
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,980
[Kkuk succeeded with two customers.]

332
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,150
[The next challenger is Big Nose.]

333
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,350
- Okay, good!
- Don't try to stick out!

334
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,310
I won't!

335
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,250
[The oldest part-timer is]

336
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,750
[going to work.]

337
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,650
He's very casual!

338
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,910
He looks like the boss.

339
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,510
When someone beautiful
walks in, he'll say

340
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,810
'You're so beautiful.'

341
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,610
He can't help himself.

342
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,490
[He's finally at the counter.]
How do you scan?

343
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,010
[The newcomer is being taught.]

344
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,280
[Less than a minute later,
his first customer arrived.]

345
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,180
[While she isn't paying attention.]

346
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,980
[He changes his face
by puffing up his cheeks.]

347
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,150
[Will she recognize him?]

348
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,150
I don't think she knows.

349
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,890
The customers don't
really look up much...

350
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,160
[Her gaze is following Big Nose!]

351
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,490
[Press change, then press cash.]

352
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,430
[She seemed like she was looking]

353
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,830
[but she turned her head away.]

354
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,600
[Did she see?
I think she saw...]

355
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you, come again.

356
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,340
[They left as soon as he was done.]

357
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,840
[Did they not recognize me?]

358
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,750
He's slightly hurt!

359
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,450
[He succeeded with his first customer,
but he's sighing for some reason...]

360
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,690
- I'm not that recognizable, right?
- Pardon?

361
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,790
- Yes.
- Right?

362
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,660
[Just then, she comes back!]

363
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,560
She came back!

364
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,070
[She was finished
with her check-out.]

365
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,040
[Why is she back?]

366
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,510
[The woman who didn't recognize me...]

367
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,340
[She's coming closer...]

368
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,810
[Huh? She isn't interested.]

369
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,120
[I'm still hungry.]

370
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,650
[Oh, that's what it was...]

371
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,160
[It's a relief, but he
still looks a little sad.]

372
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,730
[Don't cry...]

373
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,600
[His second customer
came to buy a drink.]

374
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
He's looking!
He's looking!

375
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,080
[He's somewhat familiar...]

376
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,510
It's 1,000 won.

377
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,110
[Big Nose's face must
be pretty common.]

378
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,720
It's 1,000 won.

379
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,050
[An incomplete voice
change just brings sneers.]

380
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,290
Why is he doing that?

381
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:43,360
He shouldn't do that kind of things!
He thinks he sounds perfect!

382
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,830
[His third customer doesn't
show any signs either.]

383
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,070
[The next customer is
waiting for check-out.]

384
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,810
[Peek]

385
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,480
[He looked!]

386
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,950
[He looks, and looks again.]

387
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,060
[Fixed gaze]

388
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,260
Maybe he's just in a hurry.

389
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,700
- A bag, please.
- Yes.

390
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,270
- I'll get it for you.
- No, I can get it.

391
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,640
Thank you.

392
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,150
[His fourth customer left
without recognizing him.]

393
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
I think he just stared
because he was slow.

394
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,090
The way he looked at him was
'What's wrong with this guy...'

395
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,990
'Why is he so sluggish?'

396
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,010
[Lift]

397
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,110
He lifted his hat up!

398
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,180
Did you see him casually
lifting his hat up?

399
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,400
[He's getting a little restless.]

400
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,370
Hello.

401
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,710
[Huh!
This person is...]

402
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,550
[The person who is
scanning my sandwich...]

403
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,450
[is it him?]

404
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,550
He can't take his eyes off him!

405
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,380
Press enter!

406
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,650
Please sign here.
It's my first day.

407
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,860
It's my first day.

408
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,610
[What's that?]

409
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,470
I told him not to do that!

410
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,410
[He still doesn't recognize me?]

411
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,580
That will be 2,550 won.

412
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,010
Why does he talk like that?

413
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,750
- What is he doing?
- I'm not sure...

414
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,350
- Do you need a bag?
- No.

415
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,750
- Thank you, come again.
- He's lifting his hat up!

416
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,580
- Look at him.
- He's sliding it up slowly.

417
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,610
[Before, After]

418
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,780
Here you go.

419
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,610
Are you all together?

420
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,610
He keeps talking, on purpose.

421
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,610
He's talking more and more.

422
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,210
[By any chance]

423
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,880
Are you a celebrity?

424
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,880
Are you Ji Suk Jin?

425
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,260
[He called his name?]
He said impala before.

426
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,510
[He failed the mission
with a big smile.]

427
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,280
I look like him, right?

428
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,350
- Press subtotal.
- Press subtotal.

429
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,850
Thank you.
[For recognizing me.]

430
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,840
You have a big nose.

431
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,280
[He failed, but he feels
good about this situation.]

432
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,450
We saw you lifting your hat up!

433
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,780
This is what you did.

434
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,050
[Fidget, fidget]

435
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,280
As time passes by,
you start to get slightly hurt...

436
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,380
And then he started talking more,
all of a sudden.

437
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,950
I thought I was going to succeed.

438
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,880
[The point of this observation was
to see Suk Jin's change of mind.]

439
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,510
- The point was his change of mind.
- You do get hurt!

440
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,050
After you were caught,
you smiled so big.

441
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,610
Ha Ha is just Ha Ha.

442
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,780
[No matter how much he disguises
himself, he's just Ha Ha.]

443
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,850
Ha Ha, please go down quickly
to help more customers.

444
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,410
When you go down...
I think you'll get caught going down.

445
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,310
Wearing it is better!

446
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,210
- Just be casual!
- I'll go down now.

447
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,910
[Ha Ha tries the most casual look.]

448
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,580
Good luck!

449
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,350
He's going!
[He just looks like Ha Ha.]

450
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,980
His walking is already so natural.

451
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,310
[He casually walks to the counter
as if he usually does.]

452
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,950
[He came, but he doesn't know what to do.]

453
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,180
- Would you like a bag?
- Yes.

454
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,180
[He quickly gets a bag.]

455
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,450
[He places the items in skillfully.]

456
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,680
[He's like a professional.]

457
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,280
He's good.
Ha Ha's good.

458
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,150
[He passed his first customer
so casually.]

459
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,680
They're looking at him as they leave.

460
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,610
[A heated gaze that makes him sweat.]

461
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:43,780
[Did Ha Ha fail on his first try?]

462
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,490
[Ha Ha, who didn't even disguise.]

463
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,260
[Is it him or not?]

464
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,960
[They left!]

465
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,870
That was so risky!

466
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,470
Ha Ha's so good,
he's like an actual part-timer.

467
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,870
Ha Ha's great!

468
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,440
Instead of sticking out

469
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,270
he's keeping it natural.

470
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,680
[There are still a lot of customers.]

471
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,880
[He calmly continues his task.]

472
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,920
[He passed with his second customer.]

473
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,020
[He scans the bar-codes, calculates
the subtotal, and takes care of change.]

474
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,400
[He adapted to the part-time job!]

475
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,900
[He is a hard working man indeed.]

476
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,700
[The king of part-time job,
Ha Ha succeeded in a flash!]

477
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
[Ace, Lee Dong Wook is
up for the challenge.]

478
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,070
People really don't know!
They usually say Lee Dong Gook!

479
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,050
[He sends off a foreigner
with quick hands.]

480
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,480
[When there are too
many female customers]

481
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
[and it gets risky]

482
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,730
[he stays in the corner
without standing out.]

483
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,560
[He responds based on
the type of customer!]

484
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,700
Thank you, come again!
Have a nice day.

485
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,670
[Lee Dong Gook succeeded!]

486
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,340
I think Jae Suk will get caught.

487
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,470
Jae Suk, shouldn't you
take your glasses off?

488
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,910
Is it better with them on or off?

489
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,650
- You look less like you with them off.
- I like them on!

490
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,820
- Just like Ha Ha...
- I can't recognize you like that!

491
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,890
[He successfully made his eyes big.]

492
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,940
It doesn't look like you, but it's weird.

493
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,390
You're so ugly.

494
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,260
I'll be back.

495
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,230
I don't think he should wear glasses.

496
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,430
[Run]

497
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,770
[He moves, casually
and without hesitation.]

498
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,780
It's not the right timing!

499
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,710
[Jae Suk gets to the counter safely.]

500
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,320
[Finally, his first customer arrived!]

501
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,900
[Huh?
That man...]

502
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,330
Oh my!

503
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,600
[He hasn't scanned one bar-code yet...]

504
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,370
- Yoo Jae Suk?
- Hello.

505
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,470
This isn't it...

506
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,170
How did they know?

507
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,640
- I'll help you do this...
- Please go up.

508
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes, sorry about that.
Have a good day.

509
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,910
[He failed in thirty seconds.]

510
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,620
Not even one person!

511
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,120
[Devastated]

512
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,620
I'm embarrassed!

513
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,790
How did they know?
How did you know?

514
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,160
Wow... how did you...

515
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
How did he know?

516
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,700
I didn't even get to scan once!

517
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,740
How did he know?

518
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,570
I swear he didn't know...

519
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,710
I told you to take your glasses off!

520
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,220
- I should have done something...
- You need to take them off.

521
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,550
- I was so surprised...
- It doesn't matter.

522
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,050
I laughed, without realizing.

523
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,080
- If you didn't laugh...
- It just came out!

524
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,150
I was about to scan
and he called my name!

525
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,150
[The last challenger is Giraffe.]

526
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,650
[He's showing his team a new look.]

527
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,710
- Do it, do it!
- I didn't know it was you!

528
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,440
[Who are you?]

529
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,180
[A big laugh you can
get from a tissue.]

530
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,750
[It's a hit item.]

531
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,450
It's amazing!

532
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,450
[He puts on his hat, glasses,
and the tissue.]

533
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,060
- Thank you.
- Lower down!

534
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,180
[He lowers himself so that
he doesn't get caught.]

535
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,700
[Wide open]

536
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,510
Hello, welcome to Seven.
[His first customers are group of six.]

537
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,510
We have iced drip coffee.

538
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,410
Don't say that!
[His pronunciation is weird.]

539
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,850
Welcome to Seven,
we have iced drip coffee.

540
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,280
That will be 7,200 won.

541
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,720
[A female customer approaches
like she found something.]

542
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,510
[Stare, stare]

543
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,510
Get caught, get caught.
Please get caught!

544
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,770
Get caught, get caught!

545
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,100
[She just stares
without saying anything.]

546
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,040
You must have back pain.

547
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,040
[Did he recognize him?]

548
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,250
[Will he fail the mission?]

549
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,590
Yes, I have back pains.
Thank you.

550
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,960
He didn't know?

551
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,590
Welcome to Seven,
we have iced drip coffee.

552
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
Don't talk like that.

553
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,470
- Was that Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

554
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,370
Why is he doing that?

555
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,980
- It's going well.
- They probably don't know him.

556
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,420
[Will they recognize Kwang Soo?]
They're middle-aged men.

557
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,220
It's 3,000 won.

558
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,220
I think he'll pass more than two.

559
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,430
Two people won't be bad.

560
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,760
[The third customer appeared
from nowhere.]

561
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,270
I hope she recognizes him.

562
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,370
[He's busy bending his knees
and care about the tissue ball.]

563
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,540
- How come they don't know?
- Thank you.

564
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,310
We didn't think he could
trick three customers.

565
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,540
Kwang Soo lasts longer than we thought.

566
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,920
[Giraffe is drinking water.]

567
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,250
[Oh, no, I had a tissue ball
in my mouth...]

568
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,460
[No way...]

569
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,530
That's dirty!

570
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,630
[It's not like he's acting
for a horror movie.]

571
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,070
[Oh my god.]

572
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,640
[At that moment,
the fourth customer appears.]

573
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,680
[Embarrassed, embarrassed]

574
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,610
[He forgot to bend his knees.]

575
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,580
Lower your legs!

576
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,820
- Your legs!
- Lower them!

577
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,920
No way, is he going to pass?

578
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,990
He doesn't look at his fact at all.

579
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,930
[The fourth customer
didn't look at his face.]

580
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,400
You need to act confidently.

581
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
- It feels really good when you succeed.
- Do you need a bag?

582
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,230
I couldn't feel that even once.

583
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,940
[Even the fourth customer
passed him without noticing.]

584
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,710
He's the last customer.

585
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,650
He might succeed at it.
[Huh?]

586
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,180
[All of a sudden, the customer
looks at Kwang Soo.]

587
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,050
Please, please, please!

588
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,790
[Please, get caught!]

589
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,290
[What is he looking at?]

590
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,530
[It's the screen.]

591
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,900
[He was just checking the price.]

592
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,800
[Really?]

593
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,940
It's a miracle.
[No one expected Kwang Soo would do it.]

594
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,270
Which means people don't
pay attention to the cashier.

595
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,980
- Thank you.
- He did it!

596
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,910
He succeeded at it.

597
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,250
[He come back confidently.
Giraffe is here!]

598
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,450
That was awesome!

599
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,090
They looked at me
because I'm weird-looking.

600
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,230
You look so old!

601
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,300
[Giraffe's unbelievable success.
What are the current scores?]

- Yes.</i>

605
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,080
It looks good on Gary.

That's perfect!

Gary!

614
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,510

- Gary looks nice.

Gary, are you going to go?

[He doesn't hesitate,
but casually walks to the cafe.]

626
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,940
He's in!

627
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,650

striking in the cafe.]

But he doesn't seem nervous.

I think he's going to act bold.

631
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,500
It won't be easy not to laugh for them.

632
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,240
Maybe they don't know he's Gary.

633
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,640
They're thinking who is this guy?

634
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,110
Gary looks like a guy next door.

635
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,240
No, he's rather ugly.

636

He looks like someone
in the history textbook.

- Who's he?
- I don't know.

638

each other who Gary is.

Really?
[They're so close, but still don't know.]

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,330
That's so funny.

Even the other workers
ask who that guy is.

642
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,570
They don't know.

643
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,610
The customers think it's just his style.

644

What kind of style is that?

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,110
Is this 'The Truman Show'?

- He's taking it to his table!
- Wow, he has guts!

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,970
He's serving.

661

- He saw Gary's face.
- But he doesn't recognize him.

[It's like he's revealing
that he's Gary.]

To my eyes, it's obvious.

670
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,310
Doesn't he look like himself
more that I was?

671
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
You see guys like him in some cafes.

672
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,680
Number seven, your beverage
and bagel are ready.

673
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,250
That's definitely Gary's voice.

674
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:15,010
- It's his fourth customer.
- Just one more customer, and he's done.

675
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,980
Enjoy.

676
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,680
- Wow!
- That's incredible!

and gives her the food.]

[he can complete the mission!]

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,790
[Will he be able to succeed?]

683
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,210
[He doesn't feel out of place at all...]

684
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,100
[They don't doubt him at all

Gary completes his mission!

686
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,480
- This is weird.
- We didn't expect it.

687
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
It's weird.

688
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
I honestly thought it's too obvious.

689
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
You're right.

690
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,520
- No one's suspicious.
- It's ridiculous!

691
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,460
The customers are too generous.

692
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,460

Even the workers...

697
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,950
- They don't know who I am.
- They asked who you are.

698
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,050
- They think I'm a new worker.
- They asked each other.

699
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,020
I forgot this was the mission,
and I was working hard.

700
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,120
[Seo Jun is getting ready.]

701
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,360
Seo Jun!

702
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,890
- It doesn't look like you.
- But you're handsome!

703
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,220
People will look at you.

704
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,890
He's handsome, but they won't
be able to tell who he is.

705
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,180
[He's wearing a hat and glasses.]

706
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,610
Seo Jun walks bravely.

707
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,280
I don't know if he'll be able to pass.

708
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,820
[As soon as Seo Jun opens the door]

709
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,530
[this place becomes a flower boy cafe.]

710
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,870
[What an eye candy!]

711
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,900
Look, the ladies here
started to look at him.

712
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,470
These people just said
he looks like Park Seo Jun.

713
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,040
They are looking at him carefully.

714
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,410
The three ladies right here...

715
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,290
They were served by Gary.

716
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,690
They turned around to look at him.

717
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,690
People are only interested
in handsome people.

718
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,360
[Why are they more excited than him?]

719
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,400
No one will recognize me
even if I work here all day.

720
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,500
See?
They're still looking.

721
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,610
- Did he already serve one person?
- Is she an elementary student?

722
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,380
He passed through one customer!

723
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,680
[It's like an art book
even if he's not posing.]

724
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,650
They're searching on the internet
with the keyword 'Park Seo Jun.'

725
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,320
They've only searched.

726
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,290
She's pointing a finger at him.

727
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,230
She pointed a finger!

728
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,530
[Will his identity be revealed?]

729
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,100
But they're not really sure.

730
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,070
Why would he be working here?

731
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,210
They would have doubted
if there was a camera around.

732
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,280
- They think he looks like him.
- If they ask his phone number...

733
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,550
That'll be funny.

734
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,550
I kind of feel sad they look at Seo Jun
as soon as he enters.

735
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,460
People still would have looked
even if he wasn't a celebrity.

736
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,760
It's natural to look
at beautiful people.

737
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,730
[So handsome!]

738
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:36,540
- He passed four people.
- Already?

739
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,450
[A man enters the cafe at this moment.]

740
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,350
He'll complete the mission
if he can pass this customer.

741
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,960
[Seo Jun gives him what he
ordered and he take it out.]

742
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,030
He's succeeded!

743
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,200
Wow, he didn't get caught!

744
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,440
[A girl in a uniform
enters the cafe...]

745
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
[and she has bob hair?]

746
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,780
[A wig, glasses, and a hat.]
[It's perfect!]

747
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,650
[And a girl with long hair enters after.]

748
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,090
[She only wears a hat.]

749
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,090
[Yura and Ji Hyo went
to work at the same time.]

750
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,460
A customer is here!

751
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,230
Welcome.
How can I help you?

752
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,270
That's just Ji Hyo's voice.
Why didn't she change her voice?

753
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,640
They can tell right away.

754
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,950
Is she really taking orders?

755
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,780
Please discard the receipt for me.

756
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:02,560
She asks her to discard the receipt,
but doesn't look at her face.

757
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,230
They're good at acting.

758
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,510
They're talking to each other so much!

759
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,010
[But she doesn't recognize Ji Hyo.]

760
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,650
How can you not recognize Ji Hyo?

761
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,880
- They don't know.
- They don't know Ji Hyo?

762
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,780
Please, wait a moment.

763
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,220
[Yura and Ji Hyo are
working like a real employees.]

764
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,890
Even Ji Hyo and Yura doesn't seem
like they're doing the mission.

765
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,650
I think we need to work harder.

766
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,950
I think they forgot the mission.

767
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,890
[Dance, dance]

768
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,450
Yura is dancing.

769
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,720
I think she hopes for them
to recognize her.

770
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,150
She seems like it.

771
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,240
[Look at me!]
Yura is dancing.

772
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,190
She must have felt sad.

773
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,170
She's Ji Suk Jin among idols.

774
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,190
[She hopes her fans
will recognize her.]

775
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,010
Ji Hyo is holding her face up.

776
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,810
Song Ji Hyo!

777
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,710
Why did she wear a wig?

778
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,720
- I'll give you a buzzer.
- The weather's very hot, isn't it?

779
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,430
The weather's very hot, isn't it?

780
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,590
Yes.

781
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,150
[A pretty girl greeted me.]

782
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,820
[But he doesn't recognize Yura.]

783
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,170
By any chance...

784
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,950
[He comes back and asks...]

785
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,350
[Who did he recognize between the two?]

786
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,350
[Ji Hyo?]

787
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,770
[or Yura?]

788
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,450
[While everyone is holding
their breath, he talks...]

789
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,950
Do you have a bigger straw?

790
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,030
[A straw?]
[It's disappointing.]

791
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,090
Hope you enjoy!

792
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,420
- Hope you enjoy!
- Thanks.

793
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,630
Yura said it because she
wanted him to recognize her.

794
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,920
- She almost screamed.
- Hope you enjoy!

795
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,820
People won't be able to recognize us
even if we all go together.

796
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,550
[They might or might not know
even if they wear big name tags.]

797
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,710
They wouldn't notice
even if four of us work there.

798
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,140
This is shocking.
Can we let Suk Jin do it?

799
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:23,360
They're here. They're whispering.

800
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,430
They don't notice at all.

801
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,070
- Even when you talk to them.
- Let me see your face.

802
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:35,260
Yura and Ji Hyo spoke as usual.

803
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,010
I even asked if the weather is hot.

804
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,360
He answered back with 'yes.'

805
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,680
Then are we lost?

806
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,310
So the Science Department scored 22...

807
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
and the department of
liberal arts scored 19.

808
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,160
The Science Department won.

809
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,620
We won, but we're not very happy.

810
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,450
[It's time to go meet the youths.]

811
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,560
- We're in team uniforms.
- Now, it feels like Running Man.

812
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,550
You have a choice.

813
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,750
One team will go to
the universities on the east.

814
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,990
Sungshin Women's University,
Kyunghee University, and Korea University.

815
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,050
The three school are
close to each other.

816
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,810
And the other team
will go to the west.

817
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:29,250
Ewha Womans University,
Yonsei University, and Hongik University.

818
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,480
I went to Korea University many times.

819
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,910
Then you can go to
the schools in west.

820
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,680
- Then the Red Team will go to the east.
- We'll do that.

821
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,540
Let's go!

822
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,420
[Let's go to the campuses of youths!]

823
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,280
We'll leave now.

824
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,740
Can you move your seat a little?

825
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,620
We'll go to Ewha Womans University first.

826
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,410
- Ewha Womans University?
- What will it be?

827
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,450
They say we'll recruit a lot.
I think it'll be a power game.

828
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,320
- Maybe it's tug-of-war.
- I think so, too.

829
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,020
Maybe it's a group name tag elimination.

830
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,250
That's possible too.

831
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,620
Really?

832
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,560
Dong Wook, you got to know
about Suk Jin today.

833
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,790
I'm from the same town.

834
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,420
Oh, you are?

835
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,270
Yes, I told you that three years ago.

836
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,870
Wasn't my answer the same too?

837
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,250
Isn't that why you got goosebumps?

838
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,350
Honestly, Yura has the best figure
out of all the idols.

839
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,250
Of course, she insured her legs.

840
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,350
Really?
The insurance is not for anyone.

841
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,360
Before, Lee Hye Young
insured her legs.

842
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,660
You can insure only a part of your body?

843
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,260
Only when it's like a dream.

844
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,930
When they're second to none.

845
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,130
- Like Yura's legs...
- So her legs are matchless.

846
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,200
They are the best.

847
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,740
- Do they run in your family?
- My mom has the same legs.

848
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,940
Wow, that's amazing!

849
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,010
Seo Jun said 'that's amazing!'

850
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,750
That's a family treasure!

851
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,910
When Seo Jun say stuff like that,
you need to say no more.

852
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,890
I don't know if you noticed, but
Seo Jun keeps talking about you.

853
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,960
I don't know why I'm trying to appeal.

854
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,230
I must have fallen for
you before I knew.

855
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,190
- Is she number one for you?
- Yes.

856
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,630
- How old are you, Seo Jun?
- 28.

857
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,270
- Yura is...
- 24.

858
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,100
- She's 24.
- That's perfect.

859
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,110
Four year difference?
That's fantastic.

860
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,280
Seo Jun, this is good!

861
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,410
They say that a four years difference
are a match made in heaven.

862
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,780
- Don't we need to exchange numbers?
- We need to open a chat room.

863
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,880
- I like that.
- Under 'family' category.

864
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,050
We've already exchanged
numbers with Seo Jun.

865
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,790
Then, the second brother is
going to be the operator.

866
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,930
Be the operator, Second Brother.

867
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,400
Am I being too obtuse?

868
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,010
I came here a lot for blind dates.

869
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,440
I'll announce the rule.

870
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,040
Find a student who's attending
Ewha Womans University.

871
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,580
Just one student.

872
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,080
Make sure you check the student's ID

873
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,760
and bring them to the appointed spot.

874
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,720
Who has money?

875
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,050
No one has cash?
They're delicious.

876
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,550
Chicken skewer!

877
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,600
Wow, that looks good!

878
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,100
A lot of people are following us.

879
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,970
Hello!

880
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,440
Aren't you students of
Ewha Womans University?

881
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,170
Hello!
[He greets them in a loud voice.]

882
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,790
- You look so excited.
- I think he's enjoying it.

883
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,580
Hello!
[You know me, right?]

884
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,210
Suk Jin has a lot of memory
at Ewha Womans University.

885
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,890
I had a part-time job around
this area when I was twenty.

886
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,560
I had a date here.
At that chicken restaurant!

887
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,930
- Oh, here?
- Oh, it's this cafe.

888
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,660
It's here, if you go down the stairs

889
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,890
there's a cafe.
I used to work here.

890
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,390
It's been more than twenty years ago.

891
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,810
I was paid 800 won per hour.

892
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,350
I think they're the students of Ewha.

893
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,140
800 won per hour.

894
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,180
I don't know where
the final mission site is

895
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,490
but the person has to be at the place.
So let's be careful.

896
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
It's almost like a press conference.

897
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,360
She looks nice.

898
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,460
- Which school do you attend?
- Ewha Womans University.

899
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,250
- Are you free tonight?
- Yes, I am.

900
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,770
What were you planning to do?

901
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,270
We were going to practice
for a talent show.

902
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:49,320
- What talent show?
- We're going to be at a music camp.

903
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,210
- We're from the music department.
- Going on a music camp?

904
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,950
What are you practicing?
Can you show us a bit?

905
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,220
It's a dance to the song 'Why You.'

906
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,090
One, two, three, four!

907
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,490
<i>How come you don't know yet?</i>

908
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,490
You didn't practice it yet, right?

909
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,460
This is such an old song!

910
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,000
That's true.

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,190
We don't know where it is,
but this evening

912
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,700
only one person can come.

913
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,540
I recommend her.

914
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,010
You recommend her?

915
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,850
Let's take her.

916
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:32,410
- Let's just go together.
- Do you have free time?

917
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,350
Yes.

918
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:39,520
[If they complete the group mission,
they can invite her to the final site.]

919
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,560
[The Science Department arrived
at Sungshin Women's University.]

920
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:50,580
This is where the students of
Sungshin visit the most.

921
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,040
The air surely feels different here.

922
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,840
My heart is fluttering.

923
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,140
It feels different than
when we were at the cafe.

924
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,210
- Which school do you go to?
- I go to Kookmin University.

925
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,850
- Which school do you go to?
- It's Chung-Ang University.

926
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,320
Which school do you go to?

927
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,920
Not here?

928
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,190
- Which school do you go to?
- Sungshin University.

929
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,860
Can I see your student ID?

930
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,800
- I don't have it with me.
- No?

931
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,200
Do you have your student ID?

932
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,840
[They've found a student with an ID.]

933
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,540
Let me check your ID.

934
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,410
Majoring in Korean Literature.

935
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,180
No Yoon Jae.

936
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,250
What are you planning
to do this evening?

937
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,480
If you can't come this evening,
we can't take you.

938
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,450
Nothing much.

939
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:48,590
[They challenge the mission right away.]

940
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,590
Give us the mission!

941
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,720
Please, pick one, Yoon Jae.

942
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,090
She picked the blue one.

943
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,850
Please open it, one, two, three!

944
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,700
'Egg embracing the sticker'?

945
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,430
What's that?

946
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,970
Put an egg on a disk with stickers.

947
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,330
Move the disk until
the egg gets all the stickers.

948
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,250
Wait until the previous runner
finishes it, then take turns.

949
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,750
- Put the stickers upside down.
- It's hard!

950
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,350
- This is hard!
- How can we finish it in sixty seconds?

951
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,890
- We need to roll the egg.
- How is it possible?

952
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,190
- This is difficult!
- All three stickers?

953
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,790
Start!

954
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,300
- Just like that!
- No!

955
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,660
[A narrow escape!]

956
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,440
I flipped it.

957
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,470
[Carefully, carefully]

958
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,310
[Jong Kook did it.]

959
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,780
[It's Seo Jun's turn.]

960
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,480
[Rolls]

961
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,780
That's it!

962
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,750
[Seo Jun did it smoothly.]

963
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,210
[It's Ha Ha's turn.]
Reverse!

964
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,250
That's right!

965
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,790
Oh, no!

966
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:02,800
- No!
- You're almost done!

967
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,700
[Their first attempt fails.]

968
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,770
- Fight!
- Fight!

969
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,020
Yoon Jae, cheer up!

970
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,470
You can start it again.
Get ready...

971
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,180
start!

972
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:27,580
[Mr. Capable gets a grip on it.]

973
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,550
[He succeeds at it calmly.]
He did it!

974
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,390
[It's Seo Jun's turn.]

975
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,190
[Ha Ha attempts again.]

976
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,430
That's right!
That's right!

977
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,530
[This time, it's nicely done.]

978
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,600
Yura!

979
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,160
Wow, how are you doing that?

980
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,020
[She's done it so fast!]
Good job, Yura!

981
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,980
[It's Yoon Jae, the heroine of
the Science Department.]

982
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,280
- That's good, do it slowly!
- Yoon Jae!

983
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,850
You're almost done!

984
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,180
[She endures the pressure
and succeeds at it.]

985
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,820
Kwang Soo, we can do it this time!

986
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,320
That's right!
[Two of the stickers are on the egg.]

987
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,430
[Only one sticker is left.]

988
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,270
[Kwang Soo successfully did it!]

989
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,070
Success?

990
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:23,140
Forty-five seconds!
[They completes the mission.]

991
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,070
I'm sweating!

992
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,910
This is a gift certificate
to support youth.

993
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:35,780
Later, we'll be doing
the final mission. Can you...

994
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,440
You need to come.

995
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,450
- Can you come?
- We won't ask for your phone number.

996
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,790
We just need to trust each other.

997
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,230
It's like a game of friendship,
you know.

998
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,280
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

999
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:52,890
Maybe you can meet a guy tonight.

1000
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,530
- Who's your type?
- Within the Running Man cast?

1001
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,450
If you have to pick one.

1002
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:03,610
Based on appearance only?
Then I would pick Kwang Soo...

1003
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:08,150
Think again, he's popular
because he's celebrity.

1004
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,780
You didn't see his face?

1005
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:16,420
Why me?
[Is he included in the Running Man?]

1006
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,930
I thought I had to pick
from fixed cast members.

1007
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,130
Of course, I would pick...

1008
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:26,300
I would pick him every time
I'm reborn, again and again.

1009
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:31,440
- Then, of course, you'll dump him.
- Why do you compare Seo Jun and I?

1010
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,930
I'll give this to you now.

1011
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,150
- Can you come?
- Yes.

1012
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,980
If you can't come, we might lose...

1013
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,060
- See you later!
- Good luck!

1014
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,480
[The Liberal Arts Department
is carrying out the same mission.]

1015
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,960
You did it!

1016
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,930
You've succeeded!

1017
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:03,640
We did it!

1018
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,570
It was nice.
I'm sorry I called you wrong.

1019
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,860
I'm sorry.

1020
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:13,020
We'll give Yu Bin something
to support youth.

1021
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,550
Cultural gift certificates
for movies, music, and shopping.

1022
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:20,080
This is for later.

1023
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,420
You need to show this
when you come to the final site.

1024
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,220
Come to the site.

1025
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,690
We still have a final mission.

1026
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,900
- Are you good at physical games?
- No problem.

1027
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,800
- I think she'll be good.
- Do you keep promises?

1028
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,670
Promise me that you'll
come to the site.

1029
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,400
We'll see Yu Bin, later.

1030
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,880
[The Liberal Arts Department:
Hongik University]

1031
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,610
[The Science Department:
Kyunghee University]

1032
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,810
[What's their goal this time?]

1033
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,650
Are there any students
from Hongik University?

1034
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,590
Do you go to Hongik University?

1035
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,860
- Do you currently go to the school?
- Yes, you are?

1036
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,760
Nice to meet you.

1037
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,960
Only students of Hongik University.

1038
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,830
I have her.

1039
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,540
Come over here.

1040
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,440
I found him.

1041
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,010
Please come in the middle, students.

1042
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,980
- Stand in line.
- I have a good feeling.

1043
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,180
They're so handsome!

They all look so good!

1045
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,190
These two are a campus couple.

1046
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,190
This film will exist forever,
just say that you're good friends.

1047
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:41,030
You don't know what will
happen in the future.

1048
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,720
When we suggested to say you're
friends, ' why did you two nod?

1049
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,770
We've been through
a lot of crisis together.

1050
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:54,630
- I hope the crisis becomes a chance.
- I hope so too.

1051
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,210
Who's prettier?
Yura or your girlfriend?

1052

[Looking]

1053
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,780

[He's risking his neck to be honest.]

1055
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,790
That's why they're having a crisis!
There's a reason.

1056
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,860
- How do you feel about that?
- I feel good.

1064

The first runner will put
a wreath around the neck.

1065
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,180

it without using hands.

1066
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:42,120
Repeat the relay until the last runner.

1067

- In sixty seconds!
- Do you understand?

1069
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,800
Put it on your neck and
don't use your hands.

1070
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,300
- Will he be able to do it?
- Try it.

1071
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:57,270
I think he can do it.

1072
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,500
It might be hard.

1073
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,110
He's doing it.

1074
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,670

[The last chance to invite
the youths for their final mission.]

1126

At first, it was one,
then it was five.

to the second runner.

01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,250
[The final mission site,
Yeouido Park, Seoul]

1212
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,230
[A mysterious set
in the middle of the park]

1213
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,100
What's this?

1214
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,500
What is this for?

1215
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,810
Maybe we need to push it.

1216
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,140
- We're here!
- Yoon Jae is here.

1217
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,680
[The campus couple of Kyunghee University
arrived on time.]

1218
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,280
[Welcome, everyone!]

1219
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,420
- You're here!
- It's nice to see you again!

1220
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:16,350
[There are a lot of people in
the Liberal Arts Department.]

1221
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,550
That many people came already?

1222
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,690
[Everybody in the department
of liberal arts came.]

1223
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,330
- They're on the way.
- Is that so?

1224
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,900
Are you a university student?

1225
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,970
He's doing his fifth year in college.

1226
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,000
He's majoring in architecture.

1227
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,270
[I'm a student.]

1228
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,770
[The members of
the Science Department arrived.]

1229
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,870
- It's our team members!
- Many of them came.

1230
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,580
They look strong.

1231
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,380
[They become suddenly strained.]

1232
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,750
[Who are you?]

1233
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:50,020
[The members of the department
of science have superpower.]

1234
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:58,030
[You're reliable, teammates!]

1235
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,390
Where did they recruit
those strong guys?

1236
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,960
You only recruited strong-looking guys?

1237
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,130
- I can't say no...
- We can win this!

1238
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,570
Can't it be counted as foul?

1239
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:11,000
We only picked cute guys.

1240
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,470
[What a cute boy!]

1241
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,110
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

1242
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,820
Thank you for coming here, students.

1243
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,180
Please don't call them students.
They're our siblings.

1244
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,810
We're a family.
We're one.

1245
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:31,690
Then we'll check
how many came here first.

1246
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,090
- I think they have more.
- We're missing one.

1247
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:38,260
We have fourteen members.

1248
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:42,890
Fifteen, sixteen.
We have sixteen people.

1249
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:47,110
All members have attended.

1250
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,920
How many students are here?

1251
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,340
- We have fourteen people.
- We'll start the game on time.

1252
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:02,590
Instead, you've won the chance
to have an additional member.

1253
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:08,830
- That's right!
- You can recruit a student around here.

1254
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,330
Are you a college student?

1255
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:16,100
Are you a student?
You looks strong.

1256
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,770
[Ha Ha found a strong-looking student.]

1257
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:23,410
He looks very strong.

1258
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:29,080
You're a student, right?

1259
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,450
[Their team is in excellent spirit
as they see the newest member.]

1260
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,160
Don't be afraid, brothers and sisters!

1261
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,960
There's no need to be intimidated.

1262
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,230
Please introduce yourself.

1263
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,060
I'm a biochemistry major
at Minnesota University.

1264
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,070
We're a global team!

1265
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:51,500
Are they allow to recruit
foreign mercenaries?

1266
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:55,470
[There's no boundaries to play a game.]

1267
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:59,340
So you have fifteen members.

1268
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,740
The final mission is to

1269
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,110
push the metal bar.

1270
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,480
The metal bars are attached
to the cylinder behind you.

1271
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,850
The team will get one point
when you turn

1272
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:13,390
the metal bar around and get
back to your original spot.

1273
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:16,830
From now on, you can start locating.

1274
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:21,000
[Both teams are having
a meeting to plan strategies.]

1275
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,630
I think ten of us should push one bar.

1276
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,140
We need to push harder close
to the circumference than center.

1277
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:34,010
We'll tightly stand on the outer side.

1278
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,780
[Understood!]

1279
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,080
Brothers and sister,
please come over here.

1280
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,350
Don't give up.

1281
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,050
Let's do it together.

1282
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,220
We're a family.

1283
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,260
Even though we'll be
scattered after this game

1284
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,530
at this moment, we're a family.

1285
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:56,100
- Let's do our best!
- Going down.

1286
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,600
No, we'll go up!

1287
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,170
One, two, three!
Fight!

1288
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,770
All for one, and one for all!

1289
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,110
[High in spirit]

1290
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,680
[Who will be the final winner?]

1291
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,550
[It's time for the final battle!]

1292
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,380
- I don't know who will win.
- I'm nervous.

1293
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:19,190
Honestly, I don't want to lose!

1294
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,520
This will be the single round match!

1295
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:29,660
- Ready!
- I'm so nervous!

1296
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,570
[Who will bring joy to the youths?]

1297
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,720
[Push the metal bar, starts!]

1298
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,400
[The metal bar is bent?]

1299
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:47,390
- We've pushed it too hard.
- We're too strong.

1300
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,920
Why are we so strong?

1301
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,750
Did you do too well?

1302
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,020
[They can't control their energy!]

1303
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:01,590
[They say things happen
where the youths are.]

1304
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:05,860
[The iron bar is bent!]

1305
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,700
[Therefore...]

1306
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,170
[we've changed the final mission
with tug-of-war.]

1307
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:15,570
Brothers and sisters, good luck!

1308
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:18,740
The earlier mission
can't be carried out

1309
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,110
so we'll replace it with tug-of-war.

1310
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,810
Our two members have arrived.

1311
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:27,610
- Are they here?
- Yes.

1312
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:31,050
They can join you.

1313
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:34,030
[What a nice timing!]

1314
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:37,090
This will be two of three!

1315
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:43,030
You will win when the red dot
on the rope goes over the yellow line.

1316
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:47,710
Sit down and grab the rope.

1317
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:51,610
Fight, Red Team!

1318
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:56,610
[The first round will
divide the teams' destiny.]

1319
01:14:56,610 --> 01:14:59,550
Ready!

1320
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:03,650
[Will it be the department of
liberal arts tied with friendship?]

1321
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:06,860
[Or the Science Department
armed with physical strength?]

1322
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,690
[The first round of tug-of-war starts!]

1323
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,030
[Let's go, young men!]

1324
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,910
[It's a direct confrontation!]

1325
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,520
[But the department of
liberal arts get behind.]

1326
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,720
[It's a critical moment!]

1327
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,250
[Now is the chance!]

1328
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,660
[The Science Department won
the first round of tug-of-war.]

1329
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,190
[Soldiers! We won!]

1330
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,770
[No one can stop them.]

1331
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,840
We have a disadvantage.
We can't help it.

1332
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,970
We can win one more round!

1333
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,840
We shouldn't lose our pace.

1334
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,850
Can we call this one off?
We have a lot more girls.

1335
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,350
[We can't give up like this.]
We can do it!

1336
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:12,120
[The second round of tug-of-war]

1337
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,360
[Both teams are ready for a combat.]

1338
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,260
Fight!

1339
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:21,160
[Will the battle end here?]

1340
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,930
[Or will it be turned around?]

1341
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,770
[The second round of tug-of-war, starts!]

1342
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:32,600
[The Science Department start
pulling hard from the beginning.]

1343
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,450
[He tied the rope around
his waist and crawls!]

1344
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,080
[This is the last change for
the Liberal Arts Department.]

1345
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,780
[The balance of power between
the two teams was upset.]

1346
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:47,320
[The Liberal Arts Department
are out-muscled.]

1347
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:51,160
[They're slowly dragged
down into defeat.]

1348
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,950
[To be pulled or not to be pulled.]

1349
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,190
[That is the question.]

1350
01:16:56,190 --> 01:17:01,130
[What's the result?]

1351
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:08,840
[The Science Department won.]

1352
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,380
[Young men, be happy!]

1353
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:18,650
[The battle field becomes a festival.]

1354
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,650
It was impossible for us to win.

1355
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,790
[It's fine.
You're still young.]

1356
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,730
[Thank you so much!]
You did a good job!

1357
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:29,490
We couldn't help it.

1358
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,260
Kim Jong Kook will award
the winning team.

1359
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:36,900
Please, give them
the money to support youth.

1360
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,170
[It's an honor.]

1361
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,690
[It's a small gift for the youths.]
I'm sorry.

1362
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:45,410
- One by one.
- Don't worry, I'll personally award you.

1363
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,700
I'll double the amount.

1364
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,980
God Jong Kook!
God Jong Kook!

1365
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:54,490
God Jong Kook!
[He becomes a big fan of Kkuk.]

1366
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:58,320
- Yeah!
- Thank you for doing your best!

1367
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,460
- Thank you for doing your best!
- Thank you for your hard work!

1368
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,930
Thank you for the students
who came to help here

1369
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,820
the citizens we met on the street!

1370
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:12,270
Thank you so much!

1371
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:18,090
Today's winner is
the Science Department!

1372
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,820
[The youth will go on.]

1373
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,750
<i>[Case number: 150913-1]</i>

1374
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,350
<i>[A special case that was requested
by a mysterious client.]</i>

1375
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,350
<i>[Kwon Sang Woo]</i>

1376
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,490
<i>[Sung Dong Il]</i>

1377
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:33,750
[Two legendary detectives
are here to solve the case.]

1378
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,090
[The clue is in the city!]

1379
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,560
[You need to solve the case
by using your sixth sense!]

1380
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,470
