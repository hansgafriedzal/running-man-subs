00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,240
[Case Number: 150913-2]

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,240
[Daejeon, Korea]

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,670
[Everything started from a request!]

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,500
[And a mysterious client 'X'
is behind the case.]

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,300
[The mysterious client gathers the
greatest detectives of the century.]

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,870
[A battle of dueling mysteries,
by the greatest detectives!]

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,600
[The one to reveal the identity
of client 'X' will win!]

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,420
[The greatest detectives
have gathered.]

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,800
[The legendary quick-witted
detective Yoo Jae Suk.]

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,560
[And two other detectives arrive.]

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,200
[The experienced,
detective Sung Dong Il.]

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,140
[And another who
looks suspicious.]

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,370
[The passionate detective,
Kwon Sang Woo.]

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,370
[I will solve this case!]

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,580
[It has been a while!]

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,750
I've seen Dong Il on other programs.
But Sang Woo, it's been a while!

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,670
Wow, it's been so long!

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,170
Nice to see you!

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,940
We're filming in
Sang Woo's hometown!

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,340
Oh, Daejun is his hometown!

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,800
It's my first time in
this neighborhood.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,970
Oh really?
Where did you live?

23
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,870
- In Doonsan-dong.
- Oh, Doonsan-dong?

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,300
[The song of Daejun has returned.]

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,640
[Daejun is my homeground.
Everyone, follow me!]

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,140
[The extraordinary
investigation story.]

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,870
[He's still a little nervous.]

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,870
It's been a while since he's
been on a variety show.

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,090
Jung Jun Ha always talks about
Sang Woo and So Ji Sub.

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,770
We were really close...

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,830
[Clearly stated in the past-tense.]

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,230
We were really close,
but it's a shame.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,600
Today, you are the detectives.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,370
Including Yoo Jae Suk, you
will be the team leaders.

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,200
- Oh really?
- Team leader?

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,140
So our subordinates
are over there?

37
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,470
[That's how it works?]

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,640
Can we abuse our power?

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,970
[It's going to be fun today.]

40
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,740
[The expert,
Detective Sung is here!]

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,900
[He's the best at investigating and
his sense of humor is the best.]

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,570
[I will solve the mystery and make
people laugh throughout the show!]

43
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,000
- They're downstairs, right?
- Yes, they are.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,670
- The employees will now...
- We need to pick well.

45
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,810
You will need to pick them,
but they're on a stakeout.

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,440
Oh really?

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,640
['J' Gold theme park.]

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,690
You will do a detective
hide-and-seek to test you on your

49
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,760
stakeout skills and
your adaptation skills.

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,670
In a short while,
detectives will come look you.

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,900
If you are detected by a detective and
get your name tag eliminated

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,740
you will become part of
that detective's team.

53
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Can you see me?
You can't, right?

54
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,940
Is it okay if I hide behind this?

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,210
Don't tell anyone!

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,900
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,900
- You can?
- Of course...

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,800
Is there anywhere I can hide?

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,900
- Can I hide somewhere?
- In the booth.

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,970
So a detective might not

61
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,660
necessarily eliminate
our name tags?

62
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,600
They might tell me to go away.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,770
[What if no one takes me?]

64
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,100
The person you eliminate
will become part of your team.

65
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,340
- Can't we do it alone?
- It's not mandatory to eliminate, is it?

66
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,000
[The detectives are picky.]

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,350
The important thing

68
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,600
is that there are three of you
and six of them hiding...

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
Wait... there are six, right?

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,860
How many years have you done this?
Shouldn't you know by now?

71
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,440
- He only cares about me.
- The most powerful.

72
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
'The most powerful.'

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
This is why everyone
talks about you.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,900
Stop it!

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,600
So, you might assume that you will
each have two members

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,690
but it isn't like that.

77
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,170
The more you eliminate,
the larger your team becomes.

78
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,440
- I like doing things alone.
- He's like the lonely chief...

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,340
- You know, like in the movies?
- There are characters like that.

80
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,040
I don't really think the members
will really be of any use...

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,260
- Kim Jong Kook.
- If there's anything physical, maybe.

82
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,600
Let's go Dong Il, Sang Woo.

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,340
- We just go?
- Yes.

84
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,840
- Variety shows have gotten simpler!
- We just go.

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,370
- One person might end up alone...
- That's possible.

86
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,100
- Didn't you hurt your Achilles' heel?
- I'm going to catch Jong Kook.

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,640
That's right, catch Jong Kook!

88
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,970
Is Jong Kook fast?

89
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,570
[He's fast and strong.]

90
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,800
I met Jong Kook in a sauna
five or six years ago

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,370
and he was in the hot spring, alone.

92
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,070
But at that sauna,
there were only two of us.

93
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,340
- That must have been awkward.
- I awkwardly said hello

94
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,940
as I walked in, and we silently

95
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,170
bathed together...

96
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,000
[Meanwhile, the detectives are waiting.]

97
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm going to go up one more floor.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,340
I'm going to be at an
un-guessable floor.

99
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,440
I always say this, but don't go to
the basement or the top floor.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
Because that's where people
want to go, first.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,440
So it's best to hide on
an un-guessable floor.

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,100
I've given you a tip.

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm actually pretty confident when
it comes to running away.

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I've been doing it for five years.

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,770
This is a great hiding place.

106
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,270
This is perfect if I can open it.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,170
[Just then, the team leaders arrive.]

108
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,500
- Should we get out?
- Yes.

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,640
Start!

110
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,870
[When a name tag is eliminated,
that person becomes part of the team.]

111
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,140
I was going to run a lot today.

112
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,470
But I got hurt while
playing soccer yesterday...

113
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,040
It's been a while since I've been
on an SBS variety show.

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,200
He was hired by SBS
on their first recruitment.

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, that's right!

116
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,040
In the year 1991.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,940
- He was hired by SBS.
- Yes.

118
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,940
- What's with this treatment?
- There's no red carpet, but...

119
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm so bored.
[Haroro is still relaxed.]

120
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,000
[But what's with this atmosphere?]

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,170
Are they here?

122
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,600
[Oh my!]

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,000
[Jae Suk's VJ, Kwon Yeol.]

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
[Runs away]

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,330
[When you meet them, run away.]

126
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, good luck getting
your teammates.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,300
Teammates?

128
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,900
We just look for them?

129
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,080
Let's go!

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,800
- We can take off our sunglasses, right?
- Yes.

131
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
It's so dark.

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,420
[Handsome appearance]

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,400
You're handsome!

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,320
I don't think it'll be easy.

135
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,090
Wow, this is a nice auditorium.

136
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,200
[Team leader Sung is looking
around the auditorium.]

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,970
[He found something?]

138
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,740
[He got candy!]

139
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,300
There's no basement.

140
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,470
Where will they be hiding?
Not in here...

141
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,000
A criminal knows
the mind of a criminal.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,220
They're not criminals...

143
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,570
[They're automatically a criminal
because he's chasing them.]

144
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,530
You should have seen
me playing golf.

145
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,570
[Tiger and Giraffe are
in the elevator.]

146
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,240
Ha, ha, ha.

147
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,300
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Are you here to golf?

149
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,570
What are you doing here?

150
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,740
- I have some work here.
- You guys can talk.

151
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,350
I don't think this is a place for me.

152
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,000
Hold on, I think...

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Wait, hold on!

154
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,270
[Kwang Soo's on Jae Suk's team.]

155
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,170
[This time, he tries to get Tiger.]

156
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,400
- I think...
- Why?

157
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,440
- Sir!
- What?

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,040
- I'm allowed to eliminate!
- Eliminate what?

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,600
[Team leader Grasshopper
takes Giraffe.]

160
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
I'll see you later!

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,750
- Don't bump into me!
- I won't.

162
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
So you're on one team now.

163
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,070
So what can I do?
Can I eliminate?

164
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,540
You just follow me around!

165
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,570
- Am I your shadow or what?
- Just follow me.

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,800
<i>I'm also flustered.</i>

167
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,600
[I need to avoid that team.]

168
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,370
<i>Why were you there...</i>

169
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,470
I went to the roof,
but I hid too well.

170
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,640
You hid too well?

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,710
[Current situation]

172
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,040
[Surprised]
What's with this company?

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,440
- The people are only golfing.
- It's a guest!

174
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,490
[Big Nose hasn't seen who it is, yet.]

175
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,530
I'm going to run!

176
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,870
[He chases.]

177
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,840
[He forgot about his injury.]

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
[Runs]

179
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,440
He saw me!

180
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,910
[Stops]

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,170
[He wouldn't see me here, right?]

182
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,950
[Grab]

183
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,240
Oh, my!

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,900
[He saw him under the stairs.]

185
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,770
No!

186
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,070
[Who are you?]

187
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, it's Kwon Sang Woo!
Thank you!

188
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,840
Thank you.

190
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,910
I hurt my Achilles'
heel yesterday.

191
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,540
I thought I couldn't run, but...

192
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,580
- Am I the first one?
- Yes.

193
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,090
Race start!

194
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,150
I will take you.
Please, follow me team leader.

195
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,460
He really is... handsome...

196
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,300
I don't normally...

197
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,730
I don't normally take pictures
with the guests, but...

198
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,070
[It's photo time as soon
as he's on the same team.]

199
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,070
- Can I upload it on my social media?
- Yes, of course.

200
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,070
[Is this a fan meeting?]

201
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,670
[He will be of use, right?]

202
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,940
You know what made me feel bad?

203
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,440
Jong Kook has gotten
so much weaker.

204
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,770
He's gotten so weak!
I almost cried.

205
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,600
Impala's over there.

206
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,860
Let's just pass by.

207
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:50,370
[They're trying to catch Kwang Soo.]

208
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,570
- You caught him?
- Oh my gosh, hello!

209
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,440
- I was going to catch him!
- I got caught!

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,100
You got Suk Jin?

211
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,700
I am Sang Woo's left Achilles' heel.

212
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,570
Today, I am Sang Woo's
left Achilles' heel!

213
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,800
Wow, in the middle of
this Savannah meadow.

214
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,570
- You got Suk Jin!
- I will be his left foot.

215
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,440
- Kim Jong Kook's around.
- I need to catch him.

216
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,500
[And another man who
is aiming for Mr. Capable.]

217
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,770
[Jong Kook, where are you...]

218
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,240
That's Sung Dong Il!

219
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,210
Who is that?

220
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:43,100
[Are you... Kkuk?]

221
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,030
[It's you.]

222
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,070
[I found him!]

223
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,640
Let me give you a hug.

224
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,040
Dong Il!

225
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,840
I need to give you a hug.

226
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
Dong Il!

227
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,340
[Mr. Capable is on Dong Il's team.]

228
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,640
- It's been a while!
- It's been so long!

229
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,050
- How were you?
- Good!

230
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,770
- You lost so much weight!
- I need to live.

231
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,950
No one gets cast if they're chubby.

232
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,320
You're like a coach.

233
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,200
- I was practicing golf.
- Here?

234
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,100
- You can rest.
- Where do you want to go?

235
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,870
Should we go eat?

236
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,270
I only need you.
Having you is like having 100 people.

237
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,800
- Dong Il...
- I don't need anyone else.

238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,970
[The only members left are
Ha Ha, Ji Hyo, and Gary.]

239
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,570
It doesn't look like me, right?

240
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,180
[Haroro's hiding
with the audience.]

241
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,250
Who is that?
[Ji Hyo's on the ground.]

242
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,240
It was a false alarm.

243
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,130
[The experts of escape vs.
The passionate detective.]

244
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,900
[Careful, careful]

245
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,640
- Where?
- They're there!

246
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,800
[Sang Woo's heading directly for
Gary as soon as he sees him.]

247
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,010
[Suk Jin, block that side.]

248
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,640
Please save me!
What is this?

249
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,200
Don't do this!

250
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,600
[Gary's on Sang Woo's team.]

251
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,470
- Gary's the best.
- I wanted to catch him.

252
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,140
- He's Mr. Random Capable.
- I'm your fan.

253
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,470
- Since 'Honey Family.'
- He's so handsome.

254
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,700
Who did you get?

255
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,860
- We're going now?
- You're part of our team, now.

256
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860
- Really?
- Yeah.

257
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,670
[Current situation]

258
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,670
Did you catch on?
I didn't get Jong Kook, on purpose.

259
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,070
[What is he saying?]

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,740
- Jae Suk...
- I didn't...

261
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,670
I don't want to be on
the same team as him.

262
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,740
That's why I didn't eliminate him.

263
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,890
When Jong Kook pushed you earlier,
that's the fastest I've seen you.

264
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,200
[The only detectives left
are Ha Ha and Ji Hyo.]

265
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,700
[Oh no, they're here!]

266
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,170
[He's managing his expression.]

267
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,670
[Nervous, nervous]

268
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,740
They're actually golfing, here.

269
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,900
[Huh?]

270
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,240
[It's a little suspicious
over there.]

271
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,150
Team leader!

272
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,700
He's over here.

273
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,040
- Oh, sir!
- You're so casual!

274
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,100
You couldn't find me?

275
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,500
- You're so casual!
- I was here the whole time!

276
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,600
I was so lonely!

277
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,440
I was here the whole time,
but no one found me!

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,400
He couldn't have been more casual!

279
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,670
[Team Leader Yoo tries
to get Ha Ha right away.]

280
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,940
I want to see the guest!

281
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,440
[Punch, punch]

282
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,160
[Rip]

283
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,470
[Ha Ha is on Jae Suk's team.]

284
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,400
- Why couldn't you find me?
- I almost passed by.

285
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,470
If it weren't for Kwang Soo,
I wouldn't have found you.

286
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,400
Look for Ji Hyo, we would be the
strongest team if we find her.

287
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,110
I don't know who
the detectives are.

288
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,800
He got an injury
playing soccer yesterday.

289
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,070
We found her!

290
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,670
We need to get her!

291
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,690
Why is she so fast?

292
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,900
- Why is she so fast?
- What about your Achilles' heel!

293
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,970
[Ji Hyo, who ran as
far away as possible]

294
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,140
[was eventually caught by
Sang Woo, with his injury.]

295
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,870
[Rip]

296
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,740
- Oh my god!
- I got Ji Hyo!

297
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,300
Wow, Ji Hyo's so fast!

298
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,970
We have four members!

299
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,620
How can you run so
well with your injury?

300
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,100
I was so surprised!

301
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,000
[He successfully
recruited three members.]

302
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,500
[It's the start of the battle.]

303
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,400
[Mysterious client 'X'
has brought them here.]

304
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,000
[Who will be the greatest
detective to find client 'X'?]

305
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,500
What's this?

306
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,170
Is it bowling?

307
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,800
It looks fun!

308
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,070
Before we head over
to the mission site

309
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,000
we will decide the order.

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
We'll take it slow.

311
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,100
- No problem.
- It's hot, anyway.

312
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,600
Dong Il doesn't care
about winning.

313
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
It takes the burden
off my shoulders.

314
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,370
Usually, it gives me
a lot of burden.

315
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,140
I just follow you.

316
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,240
This is what you will have to do.

317
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,000
Everyone will have to
blow with their nose

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,970
to knock the pins down.

319
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,670
The team to knock the most
pins down can depart first.

320
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,400
We have Big Nose!

321
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,770
- The points add up together.
- We're at an advantage!

322
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,850
[Sang Woo's team is advantageous.]

323
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,390
[Blow]

324
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,200
Kwang Soo's blowing his nose
and it sounds like a spray.

325
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,700
- Like a spray.
- I did it with my mouth.

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,500
Can you spray some on my hair?
It's getting flat.

327
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,070
So I can style it.
[Spray]

328
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,700
It's so strong!

329
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,640
One, two, three!

330
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,800
- Wow!
- Four?

331
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,300
[He got three.]

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,900
[His nostrils get bigger
as his eyes get smaller.]

333
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,640
[Jae Suk: Three pins.]

334
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,470
It's the amount of
pins knocked down!

335
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,040
- Can I have a re-do?
- Count the pins.

336
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,470
[Second member, Kwang Soo!]

337
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,300
Ready, set!

338
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,600
[Knock]

339
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,310
[What are you doing?]

340
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,270
[How dare you!]

341
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,270
Wait!

342
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,840
- I just got hit!
- Detective!

343
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,540
We should disqualify him!

344
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,270
We can just try again!

345
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,840
Then I can just keep
knocking them down, too!

346
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,100
- And also...
- Don't touch!

347
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,270
Just let him do it!
Go over there!

348
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,230
[He seems so nonchalant
about winning before...]

349
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,100
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

350
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,540
It's not about winning,
he just can't stand injustice!

351
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,310
- Sir!
- What do you mean, sir?

352
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,340
You can't emcee well, nowadays.

353
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,580
I've never seen
someone so worked up!

354
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,610
Go away!

355
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,640
Okay, start.

356
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,840
Don't push with your hand!

357
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,720
One!
[He only got one pin.]

358
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,570
- Okay!
- I'm so dizzy.

359
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,300
- Ha Ha!
- You won't fall over like this.

360
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,230
Kwang Soo, lie down.
He's feeling slightly dizzy.

361
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,540
- Can I blow from this side?
- Anywhere is fine.

362
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,140
- His nostrils are big for no reason!
- He's dizzy.

363
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,810
- Be careful, you might get dizzy.
- Let's go!

364
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,810
Seriously.

365
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,850
[Third member, Ha Ha!]

366
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,020
The end!

367

368
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,760
[Kwang Soo: One pin.
Ha Ha: Zero pins.]

[A total of four pins.]

370
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,450
What are you guys doing?

371
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,470
Next team!

372
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,400
Are you out of your minds?

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,170
There was a
psychological burden, there.

374
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,500
You guys go first because
we only have two people.

375
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,170
Let's not talk a lot.

376
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,340
Just sit, and blow.

377
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,400
[First runner up, Sang Woo!]

378
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,070
Challenge!

379
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,420
I hope his nose
boogers come out!

380
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,290
I hope his nose boogers come out!

381
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,160
[Jae Suk's immature
psychological attack.]

382
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,760
It's done, it's over!

383
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,270
That doesn't count!

384
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,900
[He double checks his nostrils.]

385
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,800
I hope a big one comes out!

386
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey, that would be so funny!

387
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,240
- Hey, that would be so funny!
- Hey? Are you crazy?

388
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,470
Yeah, it was funny!

389
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,040
[He's ready to launch with his nose.]

390
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,740
- Okay, one more time.
- If his boogers fly, we're framing it!

391
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,370
And displaying it for a week!

392
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,970
[Blow]
Get out!

393
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,800
[Get out!]

394
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,440
[Team Leader Kwon got zero pins.]

395
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,170
[Why doesn't it work?]

396
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,900
What are you doing?

397
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,500
It's so hard!

398
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,570
[Second member, Gary!]

399
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,770
Gary's good because
rapper's do this.

400
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,440
[Beat box]
I can't do that...

401
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,490
- Beat box!
- One, two!

402
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,020
I got a runny nose!

403
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,460
You're gross!

404
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,330
I said I was sick!
I have a cold!

405
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,330
It was like spray!

406
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,400
Gary, you did nothing
but blow your nose!

407
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,840
What are you doing?

408
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,370
[The third member is Suk Jin.]

409
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,310
- It was like a spray.
- He just blew his nose!

410
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,180
Why is mine so... short?

411
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,980
It doesn't work!

412
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,080
How do you do it?

413
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,890
It's because Suk Jin
shrank his nostrils.

414
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,190
It doesn't work!

415
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,490
- Now, Suk Jin!
- Should I go?

416
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,040
Let's go!

417
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,540
Ready!

418
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,040
Be quiet!

419
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,200
[Struggle]
[What was that?]

420
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,210
[Why did his nose speak?]

421
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,040
[They currently have zero
pins knocked down.]

422
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,650
[The only one left is Ji Hyo, the ace.]

423
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,220
Ji Hyo!

424
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,650
Ji Hyo surprisingly
has big nostrils.

425
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,690
- We're relying on you!
- Her nostrils are as big as mine!

426
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,290
- Is it here?
- Yeah, that's perfect.

427
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,030
- You look so weird right now!
- Ready, set!

428
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,330
[Blow]
That's it.

429
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,900
[Even the ace didn't get any.]

430
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,030
- You were pretty!
- She's cute.

431
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,900
[Sang Woo's team didn't get any pins.]

432
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,710
This is impossible!

433
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,080
- We have four people!
- We may end up winning, right?

434
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,740
[Jae Suk's team is in the lead.]

435
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,310
- Can we try again?
- No way.

436
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,020
I need to see which
way the wind blows.

437
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,720
He needs to see, first.

438
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,150
You need to get good balance.

439
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,060
[Team Leader Sung challenges.]

440
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,160
- He said this game was childish...
- But he's so hard-working.

441
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,930
Then should I not do it?

442
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,100
[Team leader Sung is
immersed in every moment.]

443
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,170
- Good balance.
- At most, he'll get two.

444
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,880
[He got four in an instant!]

445
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,010
Old people do this
kind of stuff well!

446
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,120
- He got four!
- Four!

447
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
How did he do that?

448
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,950
[Direction: Good
Power: Good]

449
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,960
[Nice shot, team leader Sung!]

450
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,190
If Jong Kook doesn't get any

451
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,000
then it'll be a rematch.

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,300
He can't do it.

453
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,200
- If his nose is even strong...
- I've never seen someone like this.

454
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,100
We can do well in other missions.

455
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,710
- Don't touch him!
- It's a mask!

456
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,380
Don't stop in the middle!

457
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,680
[Kkuk also got four pins.]

458
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,150
He's so annoying!

459
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,120
Cultured people can't
do stuff like this.

460
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,890
Ha Ha got really
upset for a second.

461
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,360
It's not because we didn't win,
but because the other team was annoying.

462
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,870
- We did well.
- We told you already!

463
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,730
[Will they be ahead of
everyone else, later on?]

464
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,000
- We're departing first.
- Yeah, we should go!

465
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,500
There's something in here...
an envelope.

466
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,140
It's like a wedding invitation.

467
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,640
Do we pick one of the
five places we want to go?

468
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,470
There are different missions
in each location.

469
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,200
As this race is about picking
the greatest detective

470
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,300
when you get there, we won't
tell you what the mission is.

471
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,970
- Oh...
- Then?

472
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,400
You have to solve the mystery and
guess what the mission will be.

473
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,470
If you do the mission properly,
we will give you a hint.

474
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,300
For example, there'll be a glass of water
and no one will tell you what to do.

475
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,400
- You have to drink it.
- Right.

476
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,670
If you drink it, you could get a hint.
Or you might have to spill it.

477
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,470
- This is like an education program!
- Exactly.

478
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,470
It's not as random as that.

479
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,740
There are going to be hints telling you
exactly what you have to do.

- Isn't it right there?
- Oh, really?

485
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,300
Okay, so we can go here first.

486
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,070
My mom told me not to go
to far away places when I was young.

487
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,740
Because I might get lost.

488
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm going to follow what she says.

follows right after!]

490

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,400
He said he did what Kwang Soo
told him to and got eliminated first.

521
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,240
[He was the first one ousted.]

522
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,840
[Why Kwang Soo of all people?]

523
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,570
That's the Saemaeul Mural Village.

524
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,570
- Let's follow the direction.
- Bakery?

525
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,670
- Bakery?
- Or the dumpling restaurant?

526
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,790
- Dumplings?
- Should we go there?

527
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,500
[They are headed to the
dumplings restaurant.]

528
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,570
Team leader Kwon is from Daejeon.

529
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,340
We're nearing the
University I attended.

530
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,670
- Oh, it's here?
- Really?

531
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,570
- What is your major?
- Fine Arts Education...

532
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,240
- People are really...
- You're an arts student!

533
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,900
Oh my god!

534
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,070
He's a handsome arts student!

535
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,500
When I went to school, I did sports

536
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,840
or drew.

537
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,170
It was one or the other.

538
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,600
Girls would have fallen for you!

539
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,670
When he's sweating while playing sports,
like absorbed into something.

540
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,170
I really loved drawing!

541
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,770
I was always drawing through
middle and high school.

542
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,600
You look so different!

543
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,500
When I see actors or other
people drawing and stuff

544
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,940
I really want to do it, too...

545
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,540
But it's still not the right time...

546
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,150
[Departure]

547
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,140
[Expo Park]

548
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,370
[Dong Il's team is at the
entrance of Expo Park.]

549
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,230
This is the Expo Park.

550
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,000
Go and solve the mission.

551
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,770
I have a feeling the
mission's over there.

552
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,110
Right?

553
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:24,670
[Everything you see
could be a clue.]

554
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,580
Why would we have come
to Expo Science Park?

555
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,250
There should be something there.

556
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,290
Can't we just stay in the shade?

557
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,260
- This is supposed to be fall...
- It's hot, right?

558
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,160
We need to search
in this large area?

559
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,300
- I think it will be...
- That tower!

560
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,800
This is the biggest thing here.

561
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
There are clues.

562
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,940
So we'll check the
closer areas first.

563
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,370
- And then, over there...
- If I build a big house

564
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,640
I want one of those
sculptures in the garden...

565
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,550
- Like that?
- The kids would love it, too.

566
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,220
- What's around here?
- Science museum.

567
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,850
[The two detectives look manly.]

568
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,850
But this place is too big.

569
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,920
Is this program always this hopeless?

570
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,060
[He's getting sweaty.]

571
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,530
We're slowly narrowing it down...

572
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:22,240
- Are we really narrowing it down?
- Yes, we are...

573
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,700
[Expo Park]

574
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,140
[Chungang Market]

575
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,380
[Sang Woo's team's target
is the dumpling store.]

576
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,180
- It's been such a long time!
- You've been here before?

577
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,050
There used to be
a famous theater near here.

578
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,220
I watched a lot of movies there
when I was young.

579
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,820
I was in elementary school.
I think it was Chungang theater.

580
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,360
Let's go find a clue!

581
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,830
[Is this mystery game and
a trip down memory lane?]

582
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,430
I visited this market
when I was really young.

583
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,240
My mom took me to this market

584
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,540
and we ate some sausage.

585
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,940
I remember that time.

586
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,740
- Chungang Market!
- Yes, it's Chungang Market.

587
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,910
- I think it's been 30 years.
- It's the market..

588
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,310
- 30 years?
- Yes.

589
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,620
[In the area he used to
visit 30 years ago]

590
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,920
[how will he solve the mystery?]

591
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,220
- Where's the dumpling store?
- It's right there.

592
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,260
[They arrive at the mission site.]

593
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,200
- Wow, it's fried dumpling!
- Do you always have them?

594
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,240
- Can we eat first?
- Let's get in.

595
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,900
- This seems suspicious.
- Let's get inside first.

596
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,170
They look so good!
[Welcome to the dumpling zone.]

597
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,740
[What mission awaits
them at this place?]

598
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,240
I can't wait any longer!

599
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,880
[Everything you see could be a clue.]

600
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,780
[Menu]

601
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,360
[Menu]
[The rules are self-service.]

602
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,240
- The rule is self-service?
- Is this related?

603
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,940
- We need to do something, right?
- Right.

604
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,430
[They need to get to
the final site by 4 p.m.]

605
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,140
Maybe we need to make some...
within three minutes.

606
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,200
[It's a three-minute timer.]

607
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,970
What could this be?

608
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,740
- I think you're right.
- We need to make dumplings.

609
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,340
Start the timer.
Let's make it.

610
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,070
- Hurry up!
- Making dumplings, how many?

611
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,800
I haven't made dumplings before.
What do I do?

612
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,740
I hope we're wasting our time.

613
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,070
Sprinkle lots of flour.

614
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,930
Maybe this is not it.
Should we eat them instead?

615
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,270
Maybe we need to eat certain amount of
dumplings within three minutes.

616
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,440
No, this can't be.

617
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,710
It says the rule is self-service,
not water.

618
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,770
There's no hint here?

619
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,610
Oh, maybe it's this!

620
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,440
Dumpling, dumpling, dumpling!

621
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,600
Oh, that's the dumpling game!

622
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,190
Let's do it, dumpling, dumpling,
dumpling!

623
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,850
Wrong!

624
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,640
[What's hidden in this dumpling store?]

625
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
It's Expo Science Park!

626
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,240
- It's been such a long time.
- It reminds me a memory.

627
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,000
I like dumplings but
you can't miss this place.

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,240
Hey, team members!

629
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't you think we should come here?

630
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,740
This is a nostalgic place!

631
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,150
[He's emotional.]

632
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,470
This place reminds me the old times.

633
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,020
- It's Kumdori!
- I had the toy!

634
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,490
[Long time no see, Kumdori!]

635
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,460
- Let's solve the mystery now.
- What could it be?

636
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,390
They didn't appoint any place?

637
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,590
Where should we go?

638
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,200
Maybe we need to combine
all the mission sites.

639
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,600
Dumpling, pastry and...

640
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,440
That song sounds familiar!

641
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,810
- Do you remember?
- This is the 'Citizens' Exercise!'

642
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:02,250
[They casually start exercising.]

643
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,950
Let's go check where
the music comes from.

644
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,320
That's the part for side stretch.
Why would they play this song?

645
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,500
[It's not like people exercise here.]

646
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,330
[There are people exercising!]

647
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,730
[Kkuk Dong Il appear.]

648
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,670
[What are these people doing here?]

649
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,810
They think this is the mission.

650
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,910
Even his back is annoying.

651
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,110
Wait, could this be the mission?

652
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,380
It's possible.

653
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,850
[They can't just leave.]

654
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,920
[Music stops.]
They did wrong!

655
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,130
- We'll challenge!
- Don't bother us!

656
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,230
This is our spot, so
go over there and do it.

657
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,670
He's even more hysterical today.

658
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,500
Don't copy us!

659
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,070
We're just doing what we remember.

660
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,070
We were going to do this any way.

661
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,950
We'll do it in front of the tent.
Begin!

662
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,280
Let's stand apart.

663
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,520
- Do you think this is the mission?
- Yes.

664
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,990
[Because the music stopped
when they were wrong.]

665
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,090
This reminds me of the old times.
During the assembly...

666
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,900
[Arm exercise!]

667
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,100
[Their body moves by his command.]

668
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,440
I remember my school days.

669
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,710
This makes me think back
on my school days.

670
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,610
- Back stretch?
- Is this how you do it?

671
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,880
[The good example of the back stretch.]

672
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,350
[The exercise fairies aren't
making making a single mistake.]

673
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,430
I remember the exercise.
My body moves to the song.

674
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,030
That's right!
This part sounds like Ben-Hur!

675
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,130
- That's right!
- We all said it sounds like it.

676
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,000
Everyone becomes serious
when this part comes on.

677
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,410
This is the most dynamic part.

678
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,640
<i>Skipping!
One, two, three, four!</i>

679
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,310
Oh, it's the foot shake.
You need to shake it nicely.

680
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,380
[You shake off the dirt on your soles.]

681
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,550
Breathing!

682
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,690
[Inhale and exhale]
Phew!

683
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,530
[The breathing sound means
it's near the end.]

684
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,500
- Great, I can do it now.
- It almost made me cry.

685
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,940
[The Gymnast Brothers have
finished the exercise.]

686
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,510
I think we did it.

687
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,480
[Didn't we complete the mission?]

688
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,050
[Was the mission at the Expo Park
This is the 'Citizens' Exercise'?]

689
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,180
We've completed the mission.

690
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,120
[They've succeeded.]

691
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,620
Let's go to the next site.

692
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:10,160
- We can't do it.
- We give up!

693
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,230
This is too difficult.
We'll do another mission.

694
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,870
- There's another mission?
- Yes, there is.

695
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,910
We've already finished
two missions here.

696
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,040
You should do the mission
at the observatory!

697
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,680
- Go up to the observatory!
- At the observatory?

698
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,280
I just hate every single word he says.

699
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,480
He's temperamental.

700
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,990
Leg exercise!

701
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,720
They said we'll get a
hint on the phone.

702
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,090
They'll send us?

703
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,360
On the Pictalk.

704
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,030
[The hint will disappear
in 10 seconds.]

705
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,530
There's a buddy called client.

706
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,270
[Blue striped shirt]

707
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,240
Blue striped shirt?

708
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,110
[Dong Il's team acquired
the first hint.]

709
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,680
[What does this hint mean?]

710
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,980
It disappeared.

711
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,240
Where should we go next?
Check the map.

712
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,620
Let's go to a restaurant,
so we can eat, too.

713
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,490
[Sang Woo's team hasn't
figured out the mission.]

714
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,160
[Kwon Sang Woo started to move!]

715
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,900
[Grab]

716
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,800
This is the restaurant's menu?

717
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,430
- Yes, it's the restaurant's.
- No, wait.

718
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,070
Ma'am, does this belong here?

719
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,510
It doesn't!
Let's check what's on the wall!

720
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,170
[Empty]
Maybe I'm wrong.

721
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,980
Wait...

722
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,310
- It's suspicious.
- This comes off too easily.

723
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,050
Suk Jin, maybe we should
eat them by the order.

724
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,450
[Blank Ji's suggestion:
Eat the dumplings on the menu.]

725
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,790
- Maybe the ones in the picture.
- I figured it out!

726
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,060
- Is she right?
- This is it!

727
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,760
- Eat them by the order?
- No, that's not it.

728
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,230
Isn't this finding the wrong spelling?

729
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,330
- Vegitable?
- That's right!

730
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,770
[He found 'Vegitable kimchi dumpling.']

731
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,840
Steamed mugwort Pun!
Not bun!

732
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,140
Buttercup squash...

733
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,480
We found two.

734
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,150
Meat, meat!
It's should be fried meat dumpling.

735
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,420
But here, it's 'Fried meet dumpling.'

736
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,120
- How many did we find?
- Let's combine the letters.

737
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,690
[What do they need to do?]

738
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,820
There are three wrong letters.

739
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,630
We should eat them!
We should eat them!

740
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,630
[He actively agrees.]
Eat them!

741
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,560
Let's eat it one by one.

742
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,670
Give us a vegetable kimchi dumpling

743
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,870
fried meat dumpling

744
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,270
and steamed mugwort bun, please.

745
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,070
Water is self-service.

746
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,740
[They're eating up a storm.]
Water is self-service.

747
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,710
I think we're right.

748
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,950
[Isn't this the mission?]
Drink your water.

749
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,450
They're not telling us.

750
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,720
Maybe they didn't expect
us to get it this soon.

751
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,460
If you're right, you'll
get a hint on the phone.

752
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,260
[If they succeeded at the mission,
there will be a hint on the phone.

753
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
[Client]

754
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,470
[Backpack]
It's backpack!

755
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,170
Is this the hint?

756
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,770
We need to remember this.

757
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,070
- What color is it?
- It's blue.

758
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,010
[Sang Woo's team
completes the mission.]

759
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,250
- Did it disappear?
- Yes, 10 seconds passed.

760
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,250
We got off on the right foot.

761
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,520
[Will they be able to
get the next hint?]

762
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,550
Thank you.

763
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,290
My friends, let's exercise
in front of Hanbit Tower.

764
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,860
My dear friends will remember this.

765
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,130
- Follow us.
- Do you remember the music?

766
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,160
Can you put the music louder?

767
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,770
<i>Start the Citizens Exercise!</i>

768
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,570
Repeat after me.

769
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,940
- We're doing it for real.
- My friend...

770
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,580
you must be in your 30s or 40s.

771
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,840
What are you doing?
Section Chief Kim, get up!

772
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,050
Department Chief, you too!

773
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,560
[Let's take a trip down memory lane
with your stiff joints.]

774
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,690
I didn't think I would
enjoy it this much.

775
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,900
[He looks like he was electrocuted.]

776
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,700
[It's cute when you make one mistake.]

777
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,440
Many years passed,
but we still remember.

778
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,540
[His movement is fast.]

779
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,780
A student who's good at this
used to come forward.

780
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,880
That's was me.

781
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,580
Jae Suk.

782
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,620
<i>Side stretch!
One, two!</i>

783
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,320
My body just moves itself.

784
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,430
[Kwang Soo stretches at double speed.]

785
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,800
My arms move naturally.

786
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,930
Yes, my body remembers the moves.

787
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,270
[After the side stretch,
it's the back stretch.]

788
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,170
One, two!
One, two!

789
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,310
[Do you remember
the highlight of the back stretch?]

790
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,810
[Everyone screamed
while they stretching their back.]

791
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,980
<i>Full-body exercise!</i>

792
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,280
- It's the Ben-Hur music!
- It's grave!

793
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,820
I'm getting emotional.

794
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,070
We need to make a serious face.

795
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,090
I used to do that with my friends, too.

796
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,590
[Help your friend
tone their sphincter.]

797
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,570
[When they hop in their place,
they kick each other.]

798
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,170
[Kicking each other's lunch bags]

799
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,440
[After touchy touchy exercise time]

800
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,770
[doing the easy arm and leg stretch.]

801
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,980
- This is amazing.
- I remember the whole exercise.

802
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,950
It's automatic.

803
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,550
[Finally, the breathing at the end]

804
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,890
All the viewers are crying by now.

805
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,390
[Ah... it's nostalgic...]

806
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:55,160
Five, six, seven, stop!

807
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,300
[They stopped moving,
but can't stop crying.]

808
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,440
- Did we pass it?
- You passed it.

809
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,870
[They've completed
the mission at Expo Park.]

810
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,070
How have you been doing, my friends?

811
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,840
<i>Rose, rose, Rose of Sharon
is the national flower!</i>

812
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,410
[He starts singing the children's song
that everyone knows.]

813
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,480
<i>We've received the vital force
of Mt. Jungbyung.</i>

814
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,620
- Isn't it your school song?
- Yes.

815
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,890
<i>We've receive the pure
vital force of Mt. Insu.</i>

816
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,890
[A sudden school song battle]

817
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,090
Didn't you received the
vital force from something?

818
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,230
- I think they use vital force at schools.
- What is it anyway?

819
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,870
<i>We've receive the pure
vital force of Mt. Insu.</i>

820
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,170
<i>We've receive the
vital force of Mt. Insu.</i>

821
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,310
<i>We've receive the
vital force of Mt. Suri.</i>

822
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,410
- Wow, every school received it.
- A mountain

823
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,350
and the vital force are
mandatory in school songs.

824
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,650
We've completed the mission.
I'm surprised I remembered it.

825
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,150
Even the details like this.

826
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,520
[Jae Suk's team acquired
the hint, too.]

827
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,550
It'll disappear in ten seconds.

828
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,460
Blue striped shirt.

829
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,630
Let's go to the dumpling place.

830
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,460
- Dumpling or bakery?
- What's next?

831
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,400
- It's up to you.
- Let's look at the map.

832
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,200
Don't pick the other place.

833
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,310
Let's just go to Chungang Market.

834
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,440
- The Mural Village is the closest.
- The rest are all close to each other.

835
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Do you think it's
faster going this way?

836
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,450
- Or that way?
- Give up this one, and go to the rest.

837
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,880
Let's just not go there.
We can still get four hints.

838
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,490
I know you're hard working person.

839
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,060
But let's be smart, Yoo Jae Suk!

840
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,420
- Use your brain!
- I'm the team leader!

841
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,260
Who wants to go to the bakery?

842
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,900
Dumpling place?

843
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,860
Mural?

844
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,500
You can go there by yourself.

845
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,600
Give him 20,000 Won.
(20 dollars)

846
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,540
Let's go now.

847
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,780
[Runs]

848
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,640
Jae Suk!

849
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,880
[Give us the car key!]

850
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,550
[They're about to be
grounded at the park.]

851
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,160
No!

852
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,990
Oh, it opened.

853
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,560
[They were able to get in the car.]

854
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,270
I see, I'll accept your opinions.

855
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,040
I'll go there, then.

856
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,940
We can go right after we eat dumplings.

857
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,380
What's the most popular pastry
at the bakery?

858
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,180
- It's either croquette or pineapple bun.
- That sounds good!

859
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,620
I'm okay if we go to
the dumpling place first.

860
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,550
Will they have dumpling soup, too?

861
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,550
My team members must be
really hungry by now.

862
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,760
They're pretty close to each other.

863
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,760
Pick either of them, Team Leader.

864
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,530
- Yes, go ahead.
- Just trust me.

865
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,470
- Today, we have the same fate.
- We're one.

866
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,640
- That's right!
- We're one!

867
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,540
<i>One is just one, it's not two.</i>

868
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,770
<i>Two are just two, not three.</i>

869
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:11,040
<i>La-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la!</i>

870
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,940
We're here.

871
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,000
- Let's get off.
- Look, Jae Suk.

872
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,040
- I'm excited.
- Dong Hun, look at the dumplings.

873
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:28,200
[Dumpling or pastry,
what's Grasshopper's decision?]

874
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm so hungry.

875
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,310
[Isn't that a mural?]

876
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,840
There's... a mural...

877
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,170
Wait a second.

878
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,170
This isn't the dumpling place?

879
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,670
You've arrived
at Saemaeul Mural Village.

880
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,290
[Welcome to Saemaeul Mural Village!]

881
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,560
What's wrong with him?

882
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,460
- He's a swindler!
- What do we do with him?

883
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,730
You said you'll pick one of them.

884
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,970
You should have discussed with us!

885
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,040
At least, we should have
gone to the bakery!

886
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,970
You said trust you!

887
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,870
Why didn't you discuss with us?

888
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,370
We'll finish it quickly
and go somewhere else.

889
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,240
I should have protected
my name tag from him.

890
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,140
Let's go, everyone!

891
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,370
[Daejeon Station]

892
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:25,090
Wow, the station is so big!
How do they clean up?

893
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,230
The color of the backpack was blue.

894
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,060
The sign is in blue.
It's suspicious.

895
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,530
It's blue.

896
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,940
[Sang Woo thinks they might find
the clue from a blue object.]

897
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,790
[Everything you see could be a clue.]

898
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,240
Let's brainstorm if anyone
finds anything.

899
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,570
There should be the 'R' sticker...

900
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:55,140
[Gary is searching near payphones.]

901
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
<i>Maybe Gary found something.</i>

902
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,570
I found it.
Am I getting a phone call?

903
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,240
Why?

904
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,970
Answer the phone.
It's ringing?

905
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,240
<i>I'll give you a question.</i>

906
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,170
<i>You need to solve the problem
in order to acquire a hint.</i>

907
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:14,270
- Getting a call on a payphone?
- It's real!

908
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,270
Is he serious?

909
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:20,940
<i>What color are the sneakers
that PD Yim Hyung Taek is wearing?</i>

910
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,600
He's asking the color of the sneakers
that PD Yim Hyung Taek is wearing.

911
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,600
- Who?
- Seriously?

912
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,700
I was with him but I don't remember.

913
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,440
Who looks at other people's sneakers?

914
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,040
- Let's just guess, blue!
- White!

915
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,100
- The backpack was blue.
- Say it on the phone.

916
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,770
It's blue.

917
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,270
<i>- You're wrong.
- No, I mean white.</i>

918
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,930
- Hello!
- Did he hang up?

919
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,640
- Is this a joke?
- No, I really received a phone call.

920
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,740
- Did the bell ring?
- Gary did receive a phone call.

921
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,300
- Then they will call us again.
- Let's wait.

922
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,970
Who's working with PD Yim?
Can you contact anyone?

923
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,000
I think it was white.

924
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,670
Black, green, red!
I think it's red!

925
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,300
Since this is the mission,
I don't think it's ordinary color.

926
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,240
We can only guess.
No one's going to tell us.

927
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,400
It's ringing.
We're in trouble.

928
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,970
<i>What color are the sneakers
that PD Yim Hyung Taek is wearing?</i>

929
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,400
Try mumbling it.

930
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,300
<i>- It's... color!
- Please, say it clearly.</i>

931
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,870
- It's the color!
- Did you see PD Hyung Taek's sneakers?

932
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,670
<i>- Wrong answer.
- I didn't say it yet.</i>

933
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,840
He hung up.

934
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,780
Are you sure?

935
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,050
- I see, Julie!
- Did anyone see it?

936
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,750
Are you sure?

937
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,250
Are you sure it was orange?

938
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,620
I told you it could be red!

939
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,320
- Is that your stylist?
- Yes, she saw them.

940
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,240
I said it's close to red.

941
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,170
[Sang Woo's team might be
able to get the second hint.]

942
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,240
We got help from the stylists.

943
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,400
He's wearing something
that stands out today.

944
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,500
It's ringing!

945
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,840
Talk confidently.

946
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,040
What?
[That's too confident.]

947
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,070
<i>- The sneakers of PD Yim..
- Are you asking what color it is?</i>

948
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,580
He's very confident.

949
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,650
- They're orange.
- Is that correct?

950
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,550
The message came.

951
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,070
Great!

952
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,500
- They were orange.
- It'll disappear in ten seconds.

953
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,900
Sunglasses!

954
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,670
Sunglasses, backpack, jeans.

955
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,170
- Isn't this an outfit for a trip?
- It's a trip!

956
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,170
[What are the hints for?]

957
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,340
Let's go!

958
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,340
Come over here.
This is the mural village.

959
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,840
He's a dictator!

960
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,000
Take these Polaroids with you.

961
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,570
[Everything you see could be a hint.]

962
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,440
Wow, they're all murals.

963
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,100
This one's pretty!

964
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,540
The whole village is covered by murals.

965
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,970
- Team Leader!
- Yes?

966
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:02,440
- Let's separate, there're three roads.
- Wait a second.

967
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,700
I think we need to
separate from now on.

968
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,300
- Isn't he a little scary?
- Why are you doing that?

969
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,870
Tell him not to push himself forward.

970
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,300
Don't push yourself forward.

971
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,200
You go that way, you go this way
and I'll go this way.

972
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,100
- Let's separate!
- Let's do that.

973
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,100
Wait!

974
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,270
What's wrong?

975
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:25,190
There's a camera.

976
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,870
[Is that all?]

977
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,000
- Jae Suk!
- Why?

978
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,100
- Remember, the blue-striped shirt?
- Yes.

979
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,270
A tiger with blue stripes.
Tiger means Kim Jong Kook.

980
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,540
He's annoying.

981
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,370
No? I thought it was an associating game.

982
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:46,880
But you pointed out blue stripes.
That's pretty sharp.

983
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,650
- I admit it.
- Wait!

984
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,240
What is it?

985
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,070
There's writing on the road.
What is it?

986
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,740
[Jae Suk ignores Ha Ha.]

987
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,140
Sung Yong, you need to film me!

988
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,300
Sung Yong, just follow me!

989
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,800
I have sharp eyes!

990
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,970
Quickly, three, two, one!
Withdraw!

991
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,640
Gwon Yeol, take his camera!

992
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,800
I'm the team leader!

993
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,300
Sung Yong, hurry up and come back.

994
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,970
We don't have time to waste.

995
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,240
[Ha Ha found a suspicious mural?]
Sung Yong!

996
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,800
Ha Ha!
I'm going to take a picture!

997
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,920
Move aside!
I'll be the first one.

998
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,320
[The tyrant team leader takes
everything that looks decent.]

999
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,870
Jae Suk, lower your position.
There are antennae here.

1000
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:41,140
Grasshopper gets wings!

1001
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,170
- It's a good picture?
- Did it come out okay?

1002
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,100
The next member, Ha Ha.

1003
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,470
This is a brilliant idea.

1004
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,700
- You need to open the lens.
- One, two!

1005
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,540
Ha Ha looks cute.
I will hold a pose like...

1006
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,140
- Now, withdraw!
- Yes, Sir!

1007
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,040
We don't have time to fool around.

1008
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,600
That's unfair!

1009
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,800
Wait, wait!
Look at shi!

1010
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,140
Come over here and look.

1011
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,070
Did you think this was a butterfly?

1012
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,470
- This is not a butterfly.
- Kwang Soo!

1013
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,500
[He's being philosophical.]

1014
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,400
Take off Ha Ha's microphone.

1015
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,070
Look, there's an 'R' sticker!

1016
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:30,770
[Ha Ha found an 'R' sticker.]

1017
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:35,150
Team Leader Yoo, stand in line!

1018
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,050
Attention! At ease!
Attention! At ease!

1019
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,090
You can look at it first, Kwang Soo.

1020
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,260
There's an 'R' sticker!

1021
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,090
Team Leader Yoo, pay attention!

1022
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,330
Open your eyes wide and search!

1023
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,630
I don't think he's suitable
for a team leader!

1024
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,630
- Carry this for me.
- Yes, Sir.

1025
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,170
Look closely.

1026
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,200
- Why do you think there's an R sticker?
- Why?

1027
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:01,070
- We need to take a picture here.
- All three of us.

1028
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:04,780
- Let's take a picture together.
- Please take a picture of us.

1029
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,410
We need to take it ourselves.

1030
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:11,420
- We need to take a selfie.
- He has no idea.

1031
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,290
Team Member Yoo, pay attention!

1032
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,590
I like how you try to work hard.

1033
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,620
But you need to use your brain.

1034
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,130
Your method doesn't work on this game.

1035
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,530
This is upsetting.

1036
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,500
- I'll take it.
- We need to be in the picture.

1037
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,200
One, two, three!
[Will they succeed?]

[Team Leader Ha and employees.jpg]

1039
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,870
- Wow, I found this R sticker.
- How did you find it?

1040
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,670
I should have found it.

1041
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,210
- Did we get a hint?
- No.

1042
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,280
Then, this is not the mission.

1043
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,280
It was a good picture, though.

1044
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,050
Then... maybe we need to
find more R stickers.

1045
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,780
Think, why did they give us three cameras?

1046
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,890
- Why three cameras?
- Because we're three people.

1047
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,090
Find two more stickers!

1048
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,330
- Are there more R stickers?
- That's correct.

1049
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:59,330
We need to take a
picture of R stickers!

1050
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,810
[Where's Dong Il's team's next spot?]

1051
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,370
Let's get in first.

1052
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:06,200
The chairs are the sets.

1053
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,170
I guess we need to do something here.

1054
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,610
Look at the flour.
We need to do something.

1055
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,340
I think we need to make dumplings.

1056
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,740
Do we just make dumpling?

1057
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,480
I think there should be
guideline of some sort.

1058
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,820
'Rule is self-service.'

1059
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,420
It says 'Rule is self-service.'

1060
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,190
Oh, make dumplings ourselves?

1061
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,560
Oh, could it be this?

1062
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,430
Ma'am!

1063
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,300
Can I get some water?

1064
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,130
- Water is self-service.
- Self service?

1065
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,370
- Yes.
- She said it's self-service.

1066
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,900
Can I still get water?

1067
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,310
- Two glasses of water, please.
- No, it's self-service.

1068
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,540
Maybe we need to persuade her

1069
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,910
until she gives us some water.

1070
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,550
I don't think that's it.

1071
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,920
She could bring us some water.
She's too firm.

1072
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,420
Let's see...

1073
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,920
'Rule is self-service.'
instead of 'Water is self-service.'

1074
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,130
Maybe there are some other words
that are misspelled.

1075
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,130
Eureka!

1076
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,900
You agree on everything I say.

1077
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,270
- Your reaction is too...
- No, you're right.

1078
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:17,470
I think there might be
typos or something.

they've found a typo.]

Vegitable is wrong!

00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,480
Should we order
vegetable kimchi dumplings?

1084
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,880
- Isn't this bun?
- It should be.

1085
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,350
That's wrong, too.

It's fried meat dumplings!

1087
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,760
I thought it was Japanese!

1088

Please give us one serving
of fried meat dumplings.

- Not bad, not bad.

- We need blue.

'Blue-striped shirt']

01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,000
[Detective Ha Ha
found the typos right away.]

1202
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,230
Can we have vegetable kimchi dumplings

1203
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,670
fried meat dumplings,
and steamed mugwort buns?

1204
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,240
[Is that it, really?]

1205
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,270
[Jae Suk's team acquires 'Backpack.']
Good job!

1206
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,100
- Didn't we take lots of pictures?
- We took that one, too.

1207
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,740
I'll check the murals on this side.
Check the other side.

1208
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,740
I need reading glasses,
they want me to play hidden object?

1209
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,000
We don't have time.
We should just go to the final site.

1210
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,130
Wow, fried pineapple bun!

1211
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,390
That looks so good!

1212
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:05,240
On the screen, it says
'1980, F.P. OnebiteAh.'

1213
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,070
- Just one of them is 'F.P. Onebite.'
- OnebiteAh, OnebiteAh, One bite.

1214
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:12,340
1980, F.P. OnebiteAh,
could it be 'take a bite?'

1215
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,670
I think that's it.
[Detective Ha Ha is burning!]

1216
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,740
- I think it's as simple as that.
- Wait, Team Member Ha.

1217
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,000
Team Leader Yoo, just take a bite.

1218
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,350
- I know you've solved some clues.
- It was all, not some.

1219
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,140
Just take a bite.

1220
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,570
I think someone who was
born in 1980 should take a bite.

1221
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,470
I think Kwang Soo should eat it.

1222
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,470
Is there anyone who was born in 1980?

1223
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,640
- Born in the '80s, anyone?
- Were you born in 1980?

1224
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,800
- When were you born?
- I was born in 1983.

1225
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,240
You were that young?

1226
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,670
[You look older...]
Weren't you born in the '70s?

1227
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,800
[Detective Ha Ha found a VJ!]
He was born in 1980!

1228
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,740
You were born in 1980, right?
Take a bite.

1229
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,800
He took a bite.

1230
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,970
Do you have an ID with you?

1231
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,970
See?
He asked for his ID!

1232
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,140
Team Leader Yoo!

1233
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,200
If you get this one, too...

1234
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,040
he needs to be credited
for this mission.

1235
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,030
This should be it.
Why would they check his ID?

1236
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,170
See?

1237
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,900
Team Leader Ha, who found R sticker?

1238
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,770
Who trained you?

1239
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,070
I found the sticker here!
No sticker, no message!

1240

[In the middle of a childish fight,
they acquired 'Jeans.']

1241
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,770
Did you see that?

1242
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,590
[The final mission site,
National Science Museum]

1243
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:45,360
[Three groups of detectives are
gathering in the situation room.]

1244
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,260
Dong Il, please take a seat.

1245
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,600
See?
We need to find the client among them!

1246
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,170
I've never been wrong once today!

1247
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,670
[What are the purposed of CCTV?]

1248
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,210
It feels like a disasters headquarters.

1249
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:00,810
This is the final mission of
the 'Detective Race.'

1250
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:07,100
Each teams have different
amount of hints.

1251
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,670
That's right.

1252
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:12,270
You need to find a person

1253
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:15,440
with a matching clue for
the final mission.

1254
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,490
You can find a person
through CCTV from here.

1255
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:24,170
Check if they match with your clues
and where they are.

1256
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,770
The thing is

1257
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:29,040
You're not going out all at once.

1258
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,070
One of the member will
go out at a time.

1259
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:35,670
And take turns according to your plans.

1260
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,840
You got it, right?

1261
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,570
When you think you found the client

1262
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:45,800
you can go to the booth with them
that we installed on the ground floor.

1263
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,700
And we can check
if you're right or wrong there.

1264
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,540
But we can only do that once.

1265
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,030
- We have only one chance.
- We should decide carefully.

1266
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:59,000
Each groups might have different clues.

1267
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,670
But we're all looking for
the same person, right?

1268
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:05,510
What are they doing?
Are they recruiters?

1269
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:09,140
[They come close to
Sherlock and Watson.]

1270
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,870
They look like they're looking for
a baseball player to train.

1271
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,040
[They've done discussing their plan.]

1272
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:17,420
Are you going to go out
first, Team Leader Yoo?

1273
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,400
No, I'm the team leader
and Ha Ha will go first,

1274
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,200
Just listen to me.

1275
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,640
- Go ahead.
- Team Leader Yoo will go.

1276
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,370
- You need to pocket your pride.
- I'm the leader, Ha Ha.

1277
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,840
Hurry up and go.

1278
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,570
I think Ha Ha should go first.

1279
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,440
[Jae Suk's team's first agent
will be Ha Ha.]

1280
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,240
In my opinion...

1281
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,840
- Think carefully, Team Leader Kwon.
- Ji Suk Jin...

1282
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,000
took a good rest.

1283
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,500
[Maybe, you will be more
helpful that way.]

1284
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,570
Jong Kook has more know-how.
He will go first.

1285
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,620
You don't have any other team members.

1286
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,000
[Are you looking down on us?]

1287
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,300
Didn't you see how we
played the whole day?

1288
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,140
It was really annoying.

1289
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,370
[Trying to keep it calm.]

1290
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:09,500
We were listening to classical music
when we were on the car.

1291
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,040
[We will keep detective's dignity.]

1292
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,270
But they might find it quickly.

1293
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:19,270
Of course, we'll know
if they person pass by.

1294

[The final mission of
the Detective Race begins!]

acquired by foot.]

and find client X!]

01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,130
[Three levels, 27,000 SQ.
About 300 suspects.]

1298
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,300
[And client X is hidden
amongst the suspects.]

1299
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,140
[The only things they can trust
are the clues and their senses!]

1300
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,540
[Which team will find the
client X and win the race?]

1301
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:52,980

Let's just finish the mission quickly!

1306
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,700
I guess the color of the
stripes are important, too.

1307
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,200
It's really confusing.

1308
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,440
So many of them
are wearing similar items.

1309
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,570
We'll tell you when we
find someone suspicious.

[Team members can help them by radio.]

1311
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,900
[All of them are wearing a mask
to hide their faces.]

1312
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,500
I think the last clue was the mask.

[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
found the prime suspect.]

1363
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,470
[What's going on?]
I'm downstairs.

1364
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,270
[She's showing the suspect
through the CCTV.]

1365
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,840
- That person?
- Do you see us?

1366
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,170
Is this person correct?

1367
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,940
Wait a second.

1368
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,000
[Confused]

1369
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,440
Look over here!

1370
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,670
[Is she client X?]
Downstairs!

1371
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,600
I think the color of
the backpack is light.

1372
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,100
What about the hat?

1373
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,270
- No hat?
- Hat is not one of our clues.

1374
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:15,540
[They didn't acquire the clue of hat.]

1375
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,540
I don't think so.

1376
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,270
Get go to the booth with her.

1377
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,840
[A suspect without a
hat starts running.]

1378
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,570
Could it be her?

1379
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:29,000
She's wearing backpack and sunglasses
but no hat.

1380
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,610
I think I'll take her then.
[Blank Ji abandons the prime suspect.]

1381
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:37,950
[Now is the chance!]

<i>[All the clues point at her!]

1387
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:53,800
Let's go.
Please help me once.

1388
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,630
[Detective Giraffe pulls
hand of the suspect.]

1389
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,400
I think I found her!

1390
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,100
Show us!

1391
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,340
Just take her to the booth.

1392
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,010
- Take her.
- Where did she go?

1393
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,680
[In the meantime, Kwang Soo takes
the suspect to the booth.]

1394
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,620
[They only have one chance!]

1395
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,690
[They will succeed at the final mission
if she's client X!]

1396
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,720
I'm sure it's her.
She has all the matching items.

1397
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,490
Okay, great.
Go up with her.

1398
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:25,560
We're here!

1399
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,630
Black baseball hat,
blue-striped shirt, jeans

1400
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,200
and backpack, she has everything.

1401
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,400
Don't say everything out loud.

1402
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,410
[Is she the real client X
the detectives were after?]

1403
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:40,950
[Jeans]

1404
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,920

[What's the result of
the final mission?]

1407
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:00,460
[Matched!]

1408
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,100
[Jae Suk's team succeeded
at the final mission!]

1409
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,370
It was her!
The one I caught a minute ago!

1410
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,140
[We did it!]

1411
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,640
[My friends, not all the detectives
are the best!]

1412
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,880
[The identity of client X
will be revealed in a moment!]

1413
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,080
[It's so hard to be a good detective.]

1414
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,050
This is incredible!

1415
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:25,960
[The Detective Race:
Jae Suk, Ha Ha, Kwang Soo win!]

1416
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,290
Client X, can you please come forward?

1417
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:32,360
[The mysterious client X appears.]

1418
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,930
[Who are you?]
The clues you achieved are

1419
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,900

1420
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,340
Black baseball hat

1421

blue-striped shirt, backpack

1422
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,100
- sunglasses
- There were sunglasses?

1423
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,100
And jeans.

1424
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,340
She's the only one with
all the matching items.

1425
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,650
Thank you so much!

1426
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,790
She has a beautiful silhouette!

1427
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,920
Can we see her face, too?

1428
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:01,260
Do we know her?

1429
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,240
[Excuse me for a second.]

1430
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:08,230
[Who is client X?]

1431
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:12,030
[Client X]

1432
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:18,770
[who suggested a brain
game to the detectives.]

1433
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:26,500
[What's her identity?]

1434
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,320
[Ta-da!]

1435
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,760
[Shocked]

1436
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,670
What?

1437
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,900
- Oh my gosh!
- Tae Young!

1438
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,470
[Client X is Kwon Sang Woo's wife,
Son Tae Young]

1439
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,870
You didn't recognize me?

1440
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,440
You didn't recognize your wife?

1441
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,170
[Oh no, I got decoyed...]

1442
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:58,210
[How will I face the music?]
Wait, wait!

1443
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:02,380
I thought she was
one of the celebrities.

1444
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,620
I honestly thought she's my type.

1445
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,350
[It's match made in heaven.]

1446
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,060
I thought she has nice skin.

1447
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,060
- I wanted to see her face.
- It's too late.

1448
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,770
[It's always the timing.]

1449
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,060
You're supposed to recognize
your wife by a hunch.

1450
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,370
[This won't do.]
I've experienced something like this.

1451
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:23,200
One day my wife came back
from a photo shoot with a magazine.

1452
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,600
I was waiting for the
elevator on the ground floor.

1453
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,310
She was on the elevator.

1454
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,710
- What are you talking about?
- Whose house did you visit?

1455
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:33,970
[He pushes himself into a corner.]

1456
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:38,140
I was zoning out.

1457
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,740
When the elevator opened, I thought

1458
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:45,900
a beautiful woman lives in my building
without recognizing her.

1459
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,700
You're a good actor!

1460
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,570
[He's showing the best acting
to make her feel better.]

1461
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:54,470
- That's why she loves you.
- In a way...

1462
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,770
I didn't know it was you.

1463
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:59,700
I thought she was the one.

1464
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,540
When I grabbed her arms,
we almost fell.

1465
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,870
I was thinking about
going the other way.

1466
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,880
I thought she would follow me
if I run away.

1467
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,100
So I just walked with a man.

1468
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,200
She was walking with a man?

1469
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,650
I told you not to go
out with other men!

1470
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,990
I always stay home otherwise.

1471
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:22,370
[She talks funny.]
She's a good entertainer.

1472
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:26,540
Shouldn't you give her a hug?
She came all the way for your movie.

1473
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,330
- I don't really like touchy touchy.
- She hates it!

1474
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:35,100
[Love returns.]

1475
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,370
Her face is so dull.

1476
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,980
[Embarrassed]
As if she's riding a merry-go-round.

1477
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,850
When did she join?
From the beginning?

1478
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,050
- Last week.
- Are you serious?

1479
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,120
You haven't said anything since then?

1480
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,190
He was in the States.

1481
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,890
Why did you breed disbelief
between husband and wife?

1482
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:57,830
They've just settled down
with two children.

1483
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:03,230
Thanks to 'Running Man'
my heart fluttered again

1484
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,870
when I saw her standing right here.

1485
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,100
That's enough!

1486
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,610
- That was the funniest moment!
- You didn't even know it was me!

1487
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,480
What are you talking about?

1488
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,250
I mean it.

1489
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,180
You're so sly.

1490
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,250
He's good!

1491
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,450
I want to sing with him once!

1492
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,640
Will I turn like this
when I get married?

1493
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,260
We need to learn from him!

1494

the winning prize.]

1496
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,130

[Golden magnifying glasses!]

1498
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:48,540
You should give it to him.
He has bad eyes.

1499
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,880
[They must be happy.]

1500
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,580
Thank you for being with us,
Kwon Sang Woo and Sun Dong Il.

1501
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,180
Sun Dong Il?

1502
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:00,670
Someone called him Sun Dong Yeol.
(Retired baseball pitcher)

1503
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:03,370
He was really disappointed.

1504
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:06,360
Don't call him Sun.

1505
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,060
Let's give a round of applause
for these three!

1506
