to stare at each other's faces!

146
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,490
[Not doing anything
is being helpful...]

147
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,230

[You're so silly!]

149

What are you saying?

161
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,090
[He's getting angrier the
more he thinks about it.]

162
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,450
The three of us had meals before!

163
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,530
You invited me because it was awkward
with just the two of you?

164
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,100
There's something fishy!

165
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,310

only three meal tickets.

can take the first two.

171
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,450

[Shy, embarrassed]

175
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,690
You need to play rock-paper-scissors
if there are four people.

176
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,690
Okay.

177
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,780
Rock-paper-scissors!

178
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,030
[Gary played scissors, by himself.]

179
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,230
Yeah!

180
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,780
You're disqualified.

181
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,490
- Pardon?
- That's a shame.

182
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,510
[He was the only one
who played scissors...]

183
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,430
He won by himself!

184
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,250
[The only one who plays
something different loses.]

185
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,480
- I want to go there!
- Gary, let's eat pork cutlet.

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,560
[Glare]

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,340
It's been five years
since Jong Kook did this!

188
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,720
[His first glare in five years...]

189
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't want to go!
I'm so scared!

190
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,540
People think it's real!

191
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,870
It was too scary!

192
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,230
Gary, go to Yong-In!

193
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,510
So, Gary picked Yong-In
to eat the stone pot Bibimbap.

194
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,230
The four of you, please play
rock-paper-scissors.

195
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,110
Rock-paper-scissors!

196
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,070
[Oh my!]

197
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,050
[This can't be real...]

198
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,980
Is it Eunhyuk?

199
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,090
[I won, but I feel weird...]

200
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,940
Did you see him get
surprised after winning?

201
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,740
[They're having fun teasing him.]

202
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,450
[Eunhyuk is disqualified.]

203
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,230
Eunhyuk, let's have pork cutlet.

204
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,030
I do want to eat it...

205
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,970
Come, come, come!

206
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,670
How can he go when you're so scary?

207
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,290
[It's obvious that you
don't mean it...]

208
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,740
[Scratch, scratch]

209
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,960
Come on, come on.

210
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,510
[He wanted pork cutlet,
and he got permission.]

211
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,650
- You're so dull...
- What's wrong with you?

212
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,890
I'm not dull, but...

213
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,850
[It's my last show,
but it's so hard...]

214
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,390
Ji Hyo, can't you come with me?

215
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,430
- Can't I take Ji Hyo?
- I'll eat with Gary.

216
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,430
What are you guys doing?

217
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,910
- I can't eat alone...
- I was deciding between the two.

218
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,090
[Maybe it's because it's
the place of gatherings...]

219
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,490
There's love everywhere.

220
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,210
[The teams have been decided
for the Rest Stop Food Tour.]

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
[Ring, ring]

222
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,450
Hello?

223
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,000
- Jong Kook's wife!
- Sister!

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,290
<i>Where are you, Jong Kook's wife?</i>

225
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,560
Ha Ha and I talked about it,
but we support it.

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
Me, too!

227
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,250
Congratulations,
you've passed the audition!

228
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,370
<i>You've passed the difficult
Kim Jong Kook audition.</i>

229
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,470
Congrats!

230
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,370
Can I speak to Eunhyuk?

231
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,970
Hello?

232
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,030
Today's mission for you is

233
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,090
"make Jin Young
and Jong Kook fall in love."

234
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,610
I don't think I have to do anything...

235
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,200
Jin Young is very forward.

236
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,710
How's the atmosphere, there?

237
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,980
I feel like I'm third-wheeling.

238
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,890
<i>Eunhyuk, when it's awkward</i>

239
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,280
play the telepathy game

240
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,670
ask them questions like,
"do you like winter or summer?"

241
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,180
Should I try, now?

242
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,310
Goodbye, for now.

243
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,090
Okay, summer vs. winter?
One, two, three!

244
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,690
Summer!

245
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,540
[They got the same answer!]

246
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,510
The ocean vs. the mountains?
One, two, three!

247
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,690
- The ocean.
- They got the same answer!

248
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,690
Again?

249
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,690
[Telepathy match!]

250
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,070
Last one, black-bean noodle
or spicy seafood soup?

251
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,430
They got the wrong answer.

252
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,490
You guys can order both!

253
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,490
Jin Young can feed him!

254
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,670
[Yong-In rest stop.]

255
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,470
[Gary and Ji Hyo arrived first.]

256
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,310
Toast!
Croquette!

257
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,160
Should we eat everything?

258
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,230
It's going to be so delicious!

259
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,870
I was going to go on a diet,
from today.

260
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,510
No, you can't.

261
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,670
Stone pot brown rice bibimbap
with soybean paste!

262
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,780
- We need to eat that.
- Hello!

263
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,140
We don't do any missions, first?

264
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,380
Do we just eat?

265
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,540
There aren't any missions?

266
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,650
Yes, just eat first.

267
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,290
[For free, without any missions?]

268
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,780
That's suspicious...

269
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,330
You have to let us eat it,
without worry.

270
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,870
- Just have it, without worry!
- Really?

271
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,030
We'll the the famous...

272
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,630
Two stone pot brown rice bibimbap
with soybean paste, please.

273
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,610
[The perfect combination of fresh
vegetables and a warm stone pot.]

274
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,620
[A unique bibimbap with a
spoonful of soy bean paste.]

275
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,870
Gary, look!
[This is it!]

276
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,160
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

277
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,940
[Looks around]

278
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,760
Do we really just eat?

279
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,430
[This is unusual...]
Is it really okay?

280
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,730
I'm a little nervous...

281
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,170
Let's just eat, Ji Hyo!

282
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,560
Wow!

283
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,710
Is it good?

284
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,470
It's so good!

285
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,340
Should I try some?

286
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,780
- It's good, right?
- I can add more.

287
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,250
This paste is really good!

288
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,090
The soy bean paste is really good.

289
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,650
[How's this for your way back
home from Thanksgiving?]

290
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,690
But this soy bean paste
is incredible.

291
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,870
It's fits so well with this paste.

292
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,280
With the vegetables.

293

are ready to eat]

Wow, it's amazing!

298
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,660
It's wonderful.

299
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,690
It's this!

300
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,630
It has "best" written next to it.

301
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,500
We need to eat the best!

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,540
[The rich flavor of the beef.]

303
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,340
[And some delicious toppings
for an appetizing texture.]

of the season.]

How is it?

307
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,460
- It's rich.
- I can't wait!

[Wow!]

309
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,770
It's better than the
ones in the market.

310
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,030
- It's true.
- It is.

311
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay, now

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,810
the highlight is the meat.

313
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,970
[Add the rice and meat,
half and half.]

314
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,910
And then add the radish kimchi.

315
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,110
To be honest, if this was sold in

316
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,270

I would eat it every day.

317

There are lots of times when you see

318

a fake reaction on TV and
end up disappointed, right?

319
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,760

- Pork cutlet?
- Yes, please.

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,580
Wow, that looks delicious!

352
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,460
The pork cutlet looks amazing!

353
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,070
[Let's see, the spoons...]

354
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,240
- Do we just eat?
- Thanks.

355
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,310
[She takes care of his spoon.]

356
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,310
Do we just eat?

357
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,880
[What about me?]

358
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,510
- I said I would slice it for you.
- No, it's okay.

359
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,630
I will slice it for you!

360
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,890
[Is my sincerity nothing to you?]

361
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,890
I'll do it!

362
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,590
Is this yours or mine?

363
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,560
Yours.
[We got married vs. I live alone.]

364
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,670
[She carefully takes a piece...]

365
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,890
Say ah!

366
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,360
[So charming]

367
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,630
Jin Young...
[Cute, cute]

368
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm okay.

369
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,610
[It's okay, I'm not going to look...]

370
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,430
It's really good, right?

371
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,850
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

372
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,560
The reason why it's so good

373
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,200
is the generous quantity,
first of all.

374
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,140
And the meat is really thick.

375
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,670
[And with the sweet sauce, the rest
stop's popular pork cut let is born.]

376
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,140
[She's very frugal in putting the
leftover sauce on her last piece.]

377
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,000
She eats really well.

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,480
I'm curious on what
we're going to do now...

379
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,430
[We're curious...]
[on when we're arriving...]

380
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,200
[They haven't even arrived yet.]

381
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,650
[The team that went to the closest
rest stop already finished eating.]

382
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,510
I'm so full.

383
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,140
If you are a couple, there's a role for
the boyfriend at times like this.

384
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,870
[He gets up without saying a word.]

385
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,030
[Then he pours water
that they'll drink.]

386
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,690
[And the water must not
be too cold or too hot.]

387
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,990
[Then hand her the glass, casually.]

388
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,990
[Then she says, in return...]

389
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,850
Gary!
You drank some on the way!

390
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,180
No, I didn't!

391
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,830
It's only half full!

392
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,490
[If there's too little,
she might misunderstand.]

393
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,070
Thank you for the meal.

394
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,200
- Did you eat well?
- Yes.

395
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,250
So starting now,
we will explain the rules.

396
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,940
- The rules?
- Yes.

397
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,600
As Thanksgiving is
around the corner

398
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,720
we told you that there's the

399
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,710
"Rest Stop Specialty Food Tour"
and "Thanksgiving Gift Set Race."

400
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,870
You need a team for the
"Thanksgiving Gift Set Race."

401
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,870
- Yes.
- That's right.

402
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,300
You need to choose your teams.

403
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,830
You mean the members?

404
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,700
You need to choose your own teams.

405
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
The members that have selected

406
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,230
the same rest stop will
be the primary team.

407
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,110
And until the next mission which
is in Gangneung, Gyeongpo Beach

408
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,630
you have to make a team of five.

409
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,940
You need to make a team of five.

410
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,320
While you travel, you might throw away
a member or be thrown away.

411
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,120
You could be thrown away.

412
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,460
If you are thrown away, there aren't
any other methods of transportation.

413
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,860
So you can hitchhike
to the next stop.

414
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,730
Really?
In a random car?

415
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,830
I'm shy with strangers!

416
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,960
But, even if you hitchhike

417
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,800
other teams can pick
you up on the way.

418
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,080
Why are you explaining that to me!

419
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,090
I'm just explaining, because you
said you're shy of strangers.

420
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,980
I am shy of strangers...

421
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,150
The three of us, at least...

422
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,320
shouldn't betray one another...

423
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,720
Okay, the three of us
shouldn't betray each other.

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,540
- It's five people, right?
- Yeah.

425
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,890
The three of us won't
betray each other!

426
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,400
This is how everyone
starts out, right?

427
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,400
Everyone?

428
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Let's not betray each other.

429
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's not do that.

430
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,710
Let's not separate.
Don't throw me away!

431
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,240
I can't trust you...

432
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,340
All of a sudden?
After having this together?

433
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,980
It's me!

434
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,850
[Come on, brother!]

435
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,250
- Yoo!
- Boo!

436
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Cross!

437
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,350
- Rice!
- What?

438
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,660
- Rice!
- Soup!

439
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,320
Cross!

440
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,730
We met through rice soup.

441
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,290
The pure heart of Korean people!

442
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,600
The strength of Korea!

443
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,860
The ancient mystery!

444
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,370
Inside Grandma's arms!
Friendship!

445
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,670
We will never separate.

446
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,410
If you pictured us separating,
you are mistaken.

447
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,480
There's something thicker than blood,
and it is the rice soup!

448
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,640
- Rice!
- Soup!

449
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,600
Cross!

450
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,020
[The Yeoju rest stop team
are making a teammate recruiting list.]

451
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,870
Gary and Ji Hyo won't separate.

452
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,310
They're together, right now?

453
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,430
- They've kissed already.
- Really?

454
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,030
- At a performance, on stage.
- Really?

455
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,470
They're pretty official, now.

456
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,580
- Really?
- For real?

457
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,870
They're real now...

458
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,960
Ha Ha's calling!

459
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,570
- Jong Kook.
- Why?

460
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,740
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah, I did.

461
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,860
I ate as well.

462
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,980
Did you hear about the rule?

463
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,670
Yeah, I heard.

464
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,600
What should I do?

465
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,050
Sorry, but I don't think
you guys are of any help.

466
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,800
I'll be straightforward.

467
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,760
If Suk Jin and I are together,
it won't be of any help.

468
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,110
But if one of us goes,
it'll be helpful.

469
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,800
[Disloyal Ha Ha is at it again...]

470
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>- Just you?
- Why do you think it's both of us?</i>

471
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,070
Then you can come!

472
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,250
I'll go to Yeoju!

473
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,740
- Okay then, we'll wait for you.
- Yes.

474
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

475
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,090
[What is Big Nose
doing at this time?]

476
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,450
[Big Nose is also calling.]

477
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,450
Suk Jin!

478
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,690
How many of you are there?

479
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,690
Have you eaten?

480
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,660
We're still on our way.
We're going to Hoeng-seong.

481
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,390
- Still?
- Yes.

482
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,500
Anyway, after you eat,
there will be more to talk about.

483
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,630
I'll call you later!

484
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,870
Okay!

485
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,230
Bye.

486
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,670
There's something going on!

487
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,710
[What's happening around us?]

488
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,810
Jong Kook's calling me.

489
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,480
- What's going on?
- What is this?

490
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,080
Hi, Jong Kook!

491
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,220
Where are you?

492
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,280
We're still on our way.

493
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Oh, really?

494
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Yes.

495
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,180
Well, enjoy your meal.

496
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
Yes.

497
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,470
You know that I always want
to be with you, right?

498
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,090
[Why is he confessing
all of a sudden?]

499
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,160
Jong Kook, what's going on?

500
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,340
<i>Just eat, and we'll talk again.</i>

501
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,780
- Okay, I'll call you back!
- Okay.

502
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,490
Bye!

503
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,670
What's going on?

504
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,230
There's no detail.

505
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,050
[They're curious after
the phone calls.]

506
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,270
I don't feel so bad...

507
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,560
Why is everyone calling us?

508
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,720
What is it?

509
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,450
[The Monday Couple are
having a rest stop date.]

510
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,940
- Do you want to play baseball?
- Yeah.

511
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
- Ah, oh my!
- Just hold the bat!

512
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,840
- Just hold it!
- It's too fast!

513
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,710
Hold the bat!

514
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,140
You can do it!

515
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,110
Just hit one!
Wow!

516
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,680
- Just hit one!
- I hit it!

517
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,250
- Again!
- Wow!

518
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,820
[This time, it's basketball!]

519
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,990
Go, go!

520
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,990
[The ball is my friend.]

521
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,590
[I am not lonely
as long as I have a ball.]

522
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,230
Wow!

523
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,970
Ji Hyo, I have a cramp...

524
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,470
Really?

525
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,610
Ow... ow...

526
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,570
- I don't have it.
- Ji Hyo...

527
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,080
She changed.

528
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,710
If it was a long time ago,
she would have given me a massage.

529
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,450
[The touch of an angel.]

530
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,960
An ugly guy like me

531
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,540
with no game
met a pretty girl...

532
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,710
Yes, have some.

533
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,160
[I want to have some
coffee and talk a while.]

534
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,700
[Maybe we can get closer, today...]

535
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,400
Knock, knock!
[Here's your coffee.]

536
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,070
[Can I come closer to you, today?]

537
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,600
[Lock]
Ji Hyo!

538
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,630
[Locked the door]

539
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,630
[What is this situation...]

540
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,450
- Ji Hyo!
- I just locked the door.

541
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,890
Ji Hyo!

542
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,540
I don't know what to do now.

543
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,050
Who are you calling?
Ji Hyo!

544
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,630
[The faces of betrayal,
Big Nose and Ha Ha.]

545
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,570
[Five minutes ago]

546
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,200
It's so hot!

547
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,240
[Her phone rang
when she was by herself.]

548
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
Ji Hyo!

549
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
<i>Yes?</i>

550
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,680
Are you on your way with Gary?

551
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,270
He's in the bathroom...

552
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,250
Oh... just come by yourself!

553
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,400
Really?

554
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,430
Where to?

555
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,250
Let's meet at the Yeoju rest stop.

556
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,940
- Do I just go?
- Yes, just come.

557
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,030
Ji Hyo, don't think about it!
The Gods have given you this chance!

558
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,160
<i>And then you can
meet up again, after.</i>

559
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,710
It'll give Gary the chance
to be filmed more.

560
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,470
He's here.

561
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,360
Lock the door!
Hurry!

562
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,980
[She eventually falls
into their trap...]

563
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,090
[Shut the door.]

564
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,510
Ji Hyo!

565
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,180
I locked the door.

566
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,590
[She fell into our trap!]

567
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,580
- I locked the door.
- Yeah.

568
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,980
Then get in the driver's seat.

569
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,170
Wait.

570
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,980
Ji Hyo!

571
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,310
Ji Hyo, don't joke around!
You're so silly!

572
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,030
- I got in the driver's seat!
- Good job!

573
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,400
That's amazing!

574
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,800
It's like a scene in the movies.

575
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,680
[He still doesn't
understand the situation!]

576
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,180
- Are you going to drive?
- I put my seat belt on!

577
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,450
You're amazing, Ji Hyo!

578
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,920
No, don't pull it!

579
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,600
If you betray me...

580
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
I'll have no one left to
trust in this world...

581
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,270
[She's so moved...]

582
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,980
[but the pedal was also moved.]

583
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,410
Song Ji Hyo!

584
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,960
[Is she really running away?]

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,290
Open it, let's go!

586
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,740
Ji Hyo, let's go!

587
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,160
[She's not joking!]

588
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,380
Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

589
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,760
[Newest member of
the betrayal club, Song Ji Hyo.]

590
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,230
[Don't go, Song Ji Hyo!]

591
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,930
I actually left him, for real!

592
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,630
I really drove away!

593
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,930
Come to Yeoju...

594
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,490
Do you want to come to
the Deok-pyeong rest stop?

595
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,850
Where are you?

596
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,670
I'm at the Yong-In rest stop.

597
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,740
- How long does it take from there?
- 11 kilometers!

598
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,320
Hurry up!
Come to Deok-pyeong!

599
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,780
- Okay!
- Okay, bye!

600
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,560
I came without Kang Gary...
What do I do?

601
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,200
What do I do?

602
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,940
[Desolate future]

603
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,090
[He got back stabbed by Blank Ji.]

604
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,200
It's a new feeling being
betrayed by her...

605
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,230
Then I have to hitchhike!
I've only seen this in the movies!

606
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,050
What do I do...

607
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,800
[The Kkuk-Hong couple and Eunhyuk
are at the Yeoju rest stop.]

608
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,360
The three of us aren't
betraying each other, right?

609
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,270
- Of course!
- Let's not betray each other.

610
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,270
- Yes.
- Of course!

611
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,070
There's no reason to betray
an ace like Eunhyuk.

612
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,360
I really like this team.

613
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,890
I think we're perfect...

614
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,230
- Really?
- I really like the three of us.

615
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,560
- Right?
- Yeah.

616
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,450
I think we should be careful...

617
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,070
Ha Ha's calling!

618
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,000
[Ha Ha said he would
come without Suk Jin...]

619
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,940
- Yeah?
- Right now...

620
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,940
We have Suk Jin, Ji Hyo,
and I as a team.

621
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,360
So we're waiting for Ji Hyo.
She only has 2 kilometers left.

622
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Okay.

623
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,850
If you decide quickly,
we can make the perfect team.

624
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,730
Let me just let you know
that you're on speaker phone.

625
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,240
Why would you put
me on speaker phone?

626
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,160
I instinctively did it...

627
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,480
[There's no place like here.]

628
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,470
- Ha Ha!
- You have no manners!

629
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,430
Yes, Jong Kook's wife!

630
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,850
Ha Ha, don't do that.

631
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,230
Jin Young...

632
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,870
- Are you on speaker?
- Do something with Eunhyuk...

633
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,940
Ji Hyo's here!

634
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,270
[Betrayal Blank Ji enters
Deok-pyeong rest stop.]

635
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,830
- Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo, you did well!

636
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,670
- Here, get in here.
- What do I do?

637
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,940
Jong Kook!
Ji Hyo just arrived!

638
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,440
- Ji Hyo is with you?
- Yeah.

639
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,490
- Okay...
- We'll go to Yeoju...

640
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,310
Okay, just come here then.

641
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,380
Okay, bye.

642
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,850
This is no joke!

643
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,090
Their teamwork is awesome,
but when they start shooting...

644
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,910
I can't trust "Running Man" members...

645
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,630
The three of us won't
betray each other.

646
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,990
Okay, Eunhyuk?

647
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,660
You're the most suspicious!

648
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,470
You're a "Running Man" member, too!

649
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,630
No, the three of us
will never turn coat.

650
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,630
For real.

651
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,770
- Wow, I just...
- Why?

652
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,070
Honestly, I want to
go to the bathroom...

653
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,250
but I can't leave your side.

654
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,510
I really want to go but...

655
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,580
It's so scary.

656
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,690
Since you came to join us,
our plan is

657
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,590
to take Jong Kook and Jin Young
and ditch Eunhyuk..

658
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,860
Then, it'll be five people.
Period.

659
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,400
Hurry up.
Do you want to get in this car?

660
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,160
Wait, I'll get some stuff.

661
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,380
What do I do?
Kang Gary looked really puzzled.

662
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,940
[A betrayal newbie Blank Ji
can't forget about Gary.]

663
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,380
Ji Hyo, do you want to go now?

664
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,540
[Just the two of us...]

665
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,430
Lock the door.

[What are you going to do?]

667
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,320
Do you have a phone?

[Team Leader Ha's getting ready to...]

669
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,650
We bought a lot of stuff...

670

What's going on?
It shouldn't be...

671
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,960
[Yes, it should be.]
Look at you two!

672
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,250
Suk Jin, It took...

673
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,850
less than five seconds.

674
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,370
Wait, wait.
Suk Jin...

675
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,780
It didn't even take me five seconds.

676
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,650
Ji Hyo, look!

677
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,210
I was getting some pastries for you.

678
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,280
Wait.

679
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,850
Seriously...

680
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,590
Come on!

681
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,020
I know it's funny.

682
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,860
It's very fun.
[The taste of betrayal.]

683
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,160
It's very fun, I know that.

684
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,560
You know, betrayal is...

685
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,760
- This is funny!
- I'm Ha Ha.

686
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,130
- What should I do?
- Ji Hyo, wait.

687
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,570
If we leave Ha Ha here...

688
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,640
It'll be five people
if we two of us go to Yeoju.

689
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeoju?
We can go to Pyeongchang, too.

690
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,910
- Will it be five at Pyeongchang?
- Either Yeoju or Pyeongchang.

691
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,850
We can go anywhere.

692
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,800
[Where should we go?]

- I was going to give this to you.
- Dong Hun...

Now that I think about it...

695
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,860
It'll be complex if we let you in.

696
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,590
If you don't get in,
we'll be set for either teams.

697
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,160

[Haroro's speedy race
to Yeoju Rest Stop.]

702
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,450
Seriously...

703
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,380
<i>- Dong Hun?
- Listen, Jong Kook.</i>

704
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,180
I was betrayed while
I was changing cars!

705
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,450
What?

706
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,890
I'm all by myself.

707
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,980
I was betrayed!

708
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,960
Just include me in your team.

709
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,930
It's no joke.
"Running Man" members are scary.

710
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,850
It took me five seconds
for me to change the car.

711
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,690
I was getting my phone...

712
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,000
then they locked the door.

713
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,470
I'm going there by myself.
I'll take Gary, too.

714
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,510
Let's just make a team of five.
Can you promise me?

715
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,380
- Don't refuse me!
- It's perfect.

716
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,960
I didn't betray them.

717
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,850
Don't refuse me, Jong Kook!

718
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,150
- I see, are you coming here?
- Yes, I'm on my way!

719
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,390
Okay, I see.

720
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,960
- Okay, I love you, Jong Kook!
- Okay.

721
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,510
[Wait and see...
How dare you betray me?]

722
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,190
[Hoengseong Rest Area]
Thank you for the driving!

723
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,600
[While the others are
busy betraying each other]

724
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,230
[Jae Suk's team arrive
at the rest area they chose.]

725
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,400
[Let's taste grilled
short rib patty steak!]

726
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,490
You'll have to wait about three minutes
before the food is ready.

727
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,910
I'll tell you why others
keep calling you.

728
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,310
Why is that?

729
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,780
You'll select your own team member.

730
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,050
If you make a team of five,
that'll be your final team.

731
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,490
[That's why they kept calling us.]

732
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,020
You might throw away
a member or be thrown away.

733
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,590
If you are thrown away, you need to
hitchhike to get to the next mission site.

734
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,760
Hitchhiking?

735
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,730
[I thought it was a food tour,
but it's a war!!]

736
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,630
[I should keep my mind clear...]

737
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,400
[I don't want to "hitchhike."]

738
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,810
[Just like this.]

739
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,740
Do you go to Yeoju Rest Stop
by any chance?

740
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,780
[He's busy looking for
a car in the street.]

741
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,350
Are any of you going to Yeoju Rest Stop?

742
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,590
[Kang Gary's hitchhiking.]

743
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,460
[Please, please, please...]

744
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,800
Do you go to Yeoju Rest Stop
by any chance?

745
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,060
Can you drop me over there?
[Nod, nod]

746
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,200
Are you sure?
Thank you so much!

747
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
[Honking]
I'm sorry!

748
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,670
Let's get in!

749
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,170
Thank you, thank you so much!

750
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,440
You can start driving.

751
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,610
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,200
[Thank you for letting us in!]

753
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,320
Thank you so much!

754
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,090
You know Song Ji Hyo...

755
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,560
betrayed me and left me here.

756
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,330
[It brings me tears again.]

757
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,760
I never knew she would
betray me like this.

758
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,700
I don't have money...

759
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,900
[He feels a bit awkward...]

760
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,770
I should be the one driving...

761
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,870
but I can't drive other people's car.

762
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,980
- Because there's no insurance.
- You mean this car?

763
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,750
No, I mean the insurance doesn't cover
the other person driving.

764
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,070
[He feels awkward and
hears things wrong.]

765
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,750
It's such nice weather for driving.

766
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,920
Yes.

767
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,690
I'm so sorry...

768
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,660
[Hitchhiking., It's different from
what I've seen in the movies.]

769
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,590
[Jae Suk's team is about to eat now.]

770
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,590
It's here!

771
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,060
Thank you so much!

772
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,630
That looks good!

773
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,070
Oh, my!

774
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,740
They give us soup, too.

775
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,470
Isn't that nice, Jae Suk?

776
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,910
More than anything...

777
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,040
thank you for the food!

778
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,580
[Fantastic visual]
It looks somewhat nostalgic.

779
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,950
This soup is good!

780
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,780
It's incredible!

781
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,590
Wow!

782
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,990
Try eating it with kimchi.

783
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,830
[You can enjoy steak at a rest stop.]

784
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,540
[Jong Kook's team is
waiting for others to arrive.]

785

It's about time for them to get here.

786
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,090
Let's wait a bit longer.

787
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,890
I feel listless since we ate.

788
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,630
Do you want to take a nap?

789
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,110
Are you okay?

790
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,580
- Take a nap.
- No, I'm fine.

791
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,310
You're going to leave me
when I take a nap.

792
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,510
No, it's not that.

793
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,870
No, we need a woman in the team.

794
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,290
Why would I want to leave you?

795
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,520
- They're here!
- Are they?

796
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,470
Gary's here.

797
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,340
- He's here.
- Gary!

798
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,190
She abandoned me!

799
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,190
I heard about it.

800
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,780
Are you alone?

801
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,250
- I was abandoned.
- Where's Ha Ha?

802
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,850
He's on the way, too.

803
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,070
- How many cars do we have?
- I can do anything today!

804
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,850
- Let's just go by our car.
- I'm serious!

805
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,070
Today, it's Kim Jong Kook
and the boys again!

806
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,450
It's been a while.

807
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,000
- What's that, is it Ha Ha?
- How does he have a car?

808
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,050
Why do we have so many cars?

809
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,250
- Maybe he ditched them.
- No, he was ditched.

810
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,940
Where did you get the car?

811
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,470
I brought my team's car.

812
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,140
Ji Hyo was next to me
but she kept going.

813
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,910
She must have talked to Jae Suk.

814
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,580
Oh, Suk Jin went in Ji Hyo's car?

815
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,960
- It's simple, let's make a team.
- It's five people.

816
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,160
Wow!
We made a team!

817
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,670
I'm in, seriously!

818
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,810
Eunhyuk couldn't
even go to the bathroom.

819
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,410
Let's just go to the bathroom together.

820
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,750
Hold your hands like this.

821
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,680
Seriously?

822
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,020
You can stay outside
with me over there.

823
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,320
I wanted to go to the bathroom, too.

824
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't go anywhere!

825
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,230
I was getting some snacks for the team.

826
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,930
Oh, you were getting the snacks?

827
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes, I took it from the car,
then the door was locked.

828
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,270
Ji Hyo, we're a team now.

829
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,240
We can go to Gangneung now.

830
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,580
Let's go to Gangneung!

831
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,740

Let's get out!

- Let's go!
- We have a good teamwork!

842

The wind is nice!

843

It's so pretty.
Look at the color of the ocean!

844
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,710
It's been a long while
since I've been to Gyeongpo Beach.

845
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,470
It's beautiful!

[Under the high sky of autumn,
it's an emerald sea.]

- I love it!
- It's perfect weather, too!

It just looks like a picture!

851
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,450
Don't put the food in direct sunlight!

852

- Because I'm going to take them.
- I really want it!

853
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,250
Avoid direct light!

854
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,910
Look at the ginseng!

dried yellow corvina, and on.]

All the gifts on the table
will be given out at this site.

[The gifts on the table
will be given out at this site.]

860
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,690
Not all nine of them are games.
There's a bonus in there.

861
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,290
It's a surprising gift.

862
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,870
Tell us what letter you want to flip.

863
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,650
A gift is written on the back.

864

Then, you will have
a match for the gift.

865

Suk Jin wants to choose first.

866
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,940
It's Korean beef rib gift set!

867
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,800
From the beginning,
we have everyone's favorite!

868
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,030
It's big!

869
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,540
The first game is
"Steal the full moon."

870
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,650
Two reps will face each other
and put a tube in the middle.

871
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,180
On my signal, you can pull the tube
until you reach the line at the end.

872
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,740
Isn't this unfair?

873
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,230
We won!
[It's a power game!]

874
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,160
[Mom, we'll have
Korean beef for dinner!]

875
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,870
[We love Korean beef, too.]

876
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,070
Eunhyuk is good at playing sports.

877
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,180
- Isn't it more of a power game?
- He's thin.

878
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,030
You know, people play
with tubes at the beach.

879
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,140
[Im Joo Hwan, Song Ji Hyo, Lee Kwang Soo]
[Kim Jong Kook, Hong Jin Young, Ha Ha]

880
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,980
["Steal the full moon"]
Begin!

881
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,310
Runners, please come forward.

882
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,560
[Im Joo Hwan vs. Kim Jong Kook]
I knew it.

883
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,740
[From the first round,
it's a big match!]

884
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,000
- Joo Hwan, don't try to win.
- Just give up, if you can't.

885
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,330
You're not our wild card.

886
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,580
[Don't forget to stay healthy!]

887
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,470
I think he'll try.

888
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,980
[I can't give it up that easily.]

889
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,250
Don't push yourself too much!

890
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,910
He doesn't give up easily.

891
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,850
The possibility of you
winning the game is lower.

892
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,870
The best thing possible is

893
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,110
that you can pick up the tube
in a flash and run with it.

894
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,310
It'll be fantastic, if you win.

895
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,780
You need to do it fast!

896
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
Get ready

897
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,160
[I've been hiding all along]

898
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,490
[but deep inside my heart,
I'm really competitive.]

899
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,980
[The seal is broken!]

900
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,630
[Im Joo Hwan vs. Kim Jong Kook]

901
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,630
Start!

902
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,270
[Mr. Capable is dragged.]

903
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,890
[Unbelievable!]

904
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,400
[Power!]
I can't believe this!

905
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,450
- Joo Hwan!
- What's going on?

906
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,400
[Why is he so strong?]

907
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,750
[I told you, the seal is broken!]

908
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:50,160
[Mr. Capable, I'll defeat...]

909
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,530
[Oh snap!]

910
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,360
[Joo Hwan drags Mr. Capable again.]

911
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,200
[Neck and neck]

912
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,670
- Wow, Joo Hwan is so strong!
- With Jong Kook...

913
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,340
[The unsealed desire for victory,
give me strength again!]

914
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,050
[Today, I'll defeat Mr. Capable...]

915
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,270
[He enters into combat mode.]

916
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,710
It's been a while seeing
Jong Kook doing his best.

917
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,380
Joo Hwan!

918
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,830
[No, I can't lose like this!]
Joo Hwan, you're wearing pink!

919
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,260
[Pink underpants!]

920
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,230
Bury your feet in the sand!

921
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:41,230
[His legs gave way
while he laughed away.]

922
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,780
[The power of pink gets
rid of his desire in a second.]

923
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,110
He has a cramp!

924
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,000
- You have a cramp, right?
- It's fine, now.

925
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,450
Wow, Joo Hwan is strong!

926
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,820
I told you not to push yourself.

927
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,800
[If my underpants were not pink...]

928
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,920
It's embarrassing!

929
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,360
Don't try to win!

930
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,560
Jong Kook seemed surprised.
It's been a while.

931
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,940
He was really ambitious.

932
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,000
I could feel it while I was playing.

933
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,740
Ha Ha and I should've been the players.

934
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,200
Jin Young is not an easy opponent.

935
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,540
We'll only win if
Jin Young wins this round.

936
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,770
Don't put so much pressure on me!

937
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,310
Don't do that!

938
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,040
Isn't this too close to that side?

939
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,580
It's too close.

940
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,880
Measure it by walking.

941
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,750
Chan Hee is right here.
It should be here.

942
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,690
No, it's right here.

943
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,360
[Cameraman: To the right.]

944
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,190
[Right there, okay!]

945
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,820
- He said okay.
- No.

946
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,890
The cameraman said it's here!

947
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,200
[Go away!]

948
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,030
[Don't stop me!]

949
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,200
He said it's here.
Why are you...

950
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,300
[You can see something like this
when people play "Go stop."]

951
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,800
Let's just believe in Ji Hyo.

952
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,010
[They've changed the location
of the tube for the second round.]

953
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,110
- Get ready!
- You should win, Ji Hyo!

954
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,380
I've only slept for two hours.

955
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,310
Ji Hyo only slept for ten hours, too.

956
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,020
Compared to her regular habits,
it's like she pulled an all-nighter.

957
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,590
Do you study these days, Ji Hyo?

958
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,430
She has insomnia.

959
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,910
Ready, set, go!

960
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,180
That's good, Jin Young!

961
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,800
[Jin Young strikes first.]

962
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,980
No, Ji Hyo!

963
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,160
[She gave everything from the beginning.]

964
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:18,560
[But it's not that easy to
win against the Ace.]

965
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,600
- Very good, Ji Hyo!
- It's a close game!

966
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,230
It's nip and tuck.

967
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,380
Good, pull Ji Hyo!

968
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,650
[She doesn't miss the chance
and uses all the strength she has.]

969
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,050
No, it won't do!

970
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,000
[The Energizer takes a firm stand.]

971
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,180
Ji Hyo is so strong!

972
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,560
Ji Hyo is really strong!

973
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,670
Wait, wait, brother, mommy!

974
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,310
[The absolute power manages
to put the young spirit to sleep.]

975
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,210
You never know.

976
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,080
[The second round:
Song Ji Hyo wins!]

977
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,320
Ji Hyo's so strong!
[I'm sorry, Jin Young.]

978
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Thank you.

979
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,720
- It's fine.
- It's not that you're weak.

980
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,980
- Ji Hyo never disappoints me.
- You're a bull, Ji Hyo.

981
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,470
She only slept for ten hours.

982
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,650
The Song of "Song Ji Hyo"
is for "Songaji." (calf)

983
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,140
- Ji Hyo is really strong!
- Awesome!

984
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,430
Next players!

985
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,940
We'll win this!

986
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,270
It's Kwang Soo and Ha Ha.

987
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,370
- Kwang Soo!
- Good luck!

988
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,760
- What strategy could he have?
- You can do it!

989
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,430
Think about the Korean beef set!

990
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,580
- Kwang Soo, lower your position.
- Play it fair, Kwang Soo!

991
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,490
Ready, set, go!
[Hops]

992
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,690
[Ha Ha's sudden jump]

993
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,310
[He puts his body inside the tube
and go forward.]

994
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,140
- Kwang Soo!
- Watch your hands!

995
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,850
[What are they doing?]

996
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,510
Kwang Soo, just run!

997
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,450
Just run!

998
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,510
[They're spraying their saliva.]

999
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,090
Stop it!
It's disgusting!

1000
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,760
If you keep doing it,
we'll take away the gift.

1001
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,030
[They stop their match.]

1002
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,030
- Warning, warning!
- They spit on each other.

1003
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,670
Ready, set, go!

1004
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,660
[The rematch starts.]

1005
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,140
[Ha Ha jump into the tube again.]

1006
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,130
[I won't be fooled by the same trick.]

1007
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,040
That's good!

1008
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,310
[The last match for the beef rib set.]
[We can't lose!]

1009
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,070
Why are you doing it to that extent?

1010
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,780
- It's over!
- Rib!

1011
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
[That rib is mine!]

1012
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,890
Just endure it!

1013
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,470
Kwang Soo wins!

1014
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,690
[Jae Suk's team acquires
the Korean beef rib set.]

1015
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,730
- They did their best.
- White team gets the Korean beef set.

1016
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,000
Let's get it all!

1017
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,540
- Pick a letter, please.
- Get it from the first row.

1018
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,740
- "Jeul"
- Dried persimmon!

1019
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,960
What's the game?

1020
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,000
The second game is "The Radish
Full Moon on Your Forehead."

1021
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,710
You put a pickled radish on
your forehead and eat it fast.

1022
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,160
We've played it before.

1023
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,540
- Do we all play together?
- It'll be a relay race.

1024
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,380
It's a relay?

1025
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,380
Who's good at it?

1026
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,910
Ji Hyo, you want to go first?

1027
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,450
Ready!

1028
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,180
Do I put it over here?

1029
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,180
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

1030
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,400
Ready, set, go!

1031
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,340
[The Radish Full Moon, starts!]

1032
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,070
I'll hold the hat for you.

1033
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,650
[Mr. Capable eats it in three seconds.]

1034
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,360
He already ate it.

1035
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,870
He's good at everything!

1036
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:56,040
Ji Hyo, it's okay.
Don't do it in a hurry.

1037
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,710
Slowly, slowly.

1038
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,250
It's okay, just do it bold!

1039
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,960
[Ji Hyo succeeded.]

1040
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,850
[Big Nose is the second runner.]

1041
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,650
Suk Jin, good!

1042
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,940
[Frowning]
Squint your eyes!

1043
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,770
This is so hard!

1044
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,600
It's caught by his big nose!

1045
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,280
[Big Nose succeeded.]

1046
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,270
Don't stick out your tongue!

1047
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,110
Lower your head!

1048
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,400
Seriously, this drives me crazy!

1049
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,890
[Eunhyuk becomes the black hole
of Jong Kook's team.]

1050
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,400
Bend your brows!

1051
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,930
[Will he be able to do it today?]

1052
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,500
[He fails again.]

1053
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,170
[He passes it to Gary for now.]

1054
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,700
Eunhyuk didn't do it.

1055
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,540
[It's easy if you give up your image.]

1056
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
Gary's face!

1057
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,280
- It's working!
- It's there!

1058
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,740
[Yum]

1059
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,150
It's almost there!

1060
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,280
It's done!

1061
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,920
Next!

1062
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,420
It's a tie!

1063
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,160
[He's still handsome.]

1064
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,030
[He finished in a flash.]

1065
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,860
Last one!

1066
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,970
- Victory is ours!
- Kwang Soo!

1067
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,970
Kwang Soo!

1068
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:32,140
Hey, Kwang Soo!

1069
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,310
Be bold!

1070
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,340
Why is he so slow?

1071
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,110
[While Kwang Soo is struggling]

1072
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:44,880
[Eunhyuk successfully gets it.]

1073
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,150
You're almost there!
Go!

1074
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,990
[Both teams are on
their last player.]

1075
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,190
[We can't let them win, now!]

1076
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,360
[Jae Suk's team won
the Radish Full Moon.]

1077
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,200
[Jae Suk's team won twice in a row.]

1078
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,440
[That radish...]

1079
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,440
[Triumphant]

1080
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,680
Give it to them!
It's fine!

1081
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,150
[They won the dried persimmons.]

1082
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,650
Aren't we giving him
too much stress?

1083
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:21,250
He bags are all the way down...

1084
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,520
Eunhyuk...

1085
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,220
We've never won this much with
Jong Kook as our opponent.

1086
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,330
Overpowering.

1087
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,500
[Uncomfortable]

1088
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,770
It's like a tsunami of victory
just crashed into our side.

1089
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,030
We're just so overpowering!

1090
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,200
- It happens once in a lifetime.
- Okay, I got it.

1091
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,140
[Enjoy while you still can.]

1092
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,910
[Jong Kook's counterattack
has begun!]

1093
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,880
[Save the flag in the sand castle.]

1094
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,210
Nice, nice!

1095
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,110
[Jong Kook's team got
their first victory.]

1096
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,120
[Multi-vitamins]

1097
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,710
[The Giant Hoop game.]

1098
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,270
[Thanks to Jin Young's
active participation]

1099
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,490
[they won twice in a row.]

1100
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,200
[I can't let them just win.]

1101
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,290
[Knocking down cans,
wearing a yo-yo on the can.]

1102
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,230
[Joo Hwan got them all, in a flash.]

1103
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,630
[Jae Suk's team is
in the lead once again.]

1104
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,870
[They're opening the last letter.]

1105
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,310
[Giving my gift, while smiling.]

1106
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,960
Okay!

1107
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,630
- Here, take it.
- With both hands!

1108
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,110
Please!

1109
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,450
Kwang Soo, you give it.

1110
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,290
[Here you go.]

1111
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,890
[Awkward smile]

1112
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,850
He's smiling!

1113
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,960
[Pat, pat]

1114
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,730
[They got the dried
persimmons, anyway.]

1115
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,500
That's the joy of sharing.

1116
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,300
It's really nice,
being able to share.

1117
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,770
We won't be playing any more games.

1118
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,650
But we did bring those
to give them out.

1119
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,910
Should we go one last
round with all of those?

1120
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,650
One last round with all of those!

1121
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,400
With everything!

1122
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,110
- Let's just do all of them!
- With the remaining sets!

1123
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,470
[Deal]

1124
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:11,260
You can play rock-paper-scissors,
or whatever you like.

1125
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,960
[With this game]

1126
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,530
[we're taking all of that?]

1127
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,250
Let's see who can
kick their shoes far!

1128
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,140
That's a good idea!

1129
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,210
- Let's do that.
- That's a good idea!

1130
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,810
Let's kick it far!

1131
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,580
Start from this line.

1132
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,480
- Do you want to bet all at once?
- Yes!

1133
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,280
- At once?
- Just do it at once.

1134
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,920
Okay!
[There's Korean beef left.]

1135
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,150
Let's take turns!

1136
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,050
We'll do it now.
Why don't you go first, Jong Kook?

1137
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,160
[Kick your shoes
as far as possible!]

1138
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,630
This is the last chance
to win the prize.

1139
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,530
You're not going to
complain about it later, right?

1140
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,230
Of course, winner takes it all.

1141
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,430
- Let's do it!
- I'll do it first.

1142
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,600
- Gary!
- I shouldn't take off my socks.

1143
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,140
I'll do it now!

1144
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:08,480
[The team who throws a shoe
the farthest can win all of them.]

1145
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,150
[Gary's shoe flies in an arc.]

1146
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,260
You should fly it in the beginning.

1147
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,790
[Gary strikes it first.]

1148
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,360
[Jae Suk's team's
first runner is Jae Suk.]

1149
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,270
It's too high!

1150
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,810
[He's throwing it high.]

1151
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,220
[The mental attack!]
They're attacking us with reactions.

1152
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,920
That's how you play it?
I see.

1153
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,790
[Jong Kook's team's
third runner is Ha Ha.]

1154
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,600
[It flies and lands right
next to Gary's shoe.]

1155
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,130
[Ha Ha and Gary have
the highest score.]

1156
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,330
Kwang Soo!

1157
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,100
We should've played
this kind of game before.

1158
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,270
Kwang Soo, go!

1159
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,910
You need to throw it low!

1160
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,610
He's so ugly.
[Stops]

1161
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,810
You've been always ugly.
Don't be surprised.

1162
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,080
Look at the long stride.
I hate it.

1163
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,850
That's right!

1164
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,290
[It's stopped by the camera.]

1165
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,660
Oh, no!
There's a camera!

1166
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,260
[Unfortunate]

1167
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,760
What's the camera doing there?

1168
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,230
Who put the camera right there?

1169
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,700
[Maybe it's the God of Variety...]

1170
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,670
The camera was there
when we played, too.

1171
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,670
[That's the part of the game!]

1172
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,070
- It was stopped...
- Why did he throw at it?

1173
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,270
Pay for the camera!

1174
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,040
I think it could have
gone 20 meters further.

1175
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,550
I think it could have gone to Seoul.

1176
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,850
That's absurd!

1177
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,720
Take it easy, Eunhyuk.

1178
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,860
Just think of it as if you're
going to break the record.

1179
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,730
I'll do it!

1180
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,360
[I've waited this moment...]

1181
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,670
[In no time, he was regarded
as a game black hole]

1182
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,170
[at the Radish Full Moon game.]

1183
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,270
<i>Do it one more time!</i>

1184
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,110
[I will recover from
a losing position.]

1185
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,310
[I suggested the
game that I'm good at.]

1186
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,450
[I'll show you why
I picked this game now.]

1187
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,720
[Fly!]

1188
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:42,560
[It flew beyond the line.]

1189
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,770
[A shoe missile divides the beach.]

1190
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,970
[He's absolutely the winner.]

1191
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,870
- Oh my god!
- Incredible!

1192
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,010
Yes!

1193
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,180
[Devastated]

1194
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:04,350
[Thanks to Eunhyuk, Jong Kook's
team is close to the prize.]

1195
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,920
You can be skilled at it?

1196
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,620
Don't think about it.
Just throw it.

1197
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,890
Suk Jin looks like
he's here for a picnic.

1198
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,130
He's awful.
Can is this possible?

1199
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,900
It looked like a butterfly.

1200
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,650
My shoes are covering my ankles,
so I'll use a sandal.

1201
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,130
[He's wearing indoor sandals.]

1202
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:28,740
- Is it okay?
- Sure, no problem.

1203
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:32,040
[What do we do?]
[It might land on the moon.]

1204
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,350
- Fight!
- Hope it goes over the line!

1205
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,480
I'll do it!

1206
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,450
[Let's go to the end of the beach!]

1207
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,460
[It goes up vertically.]

1208
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,530
[Oh, no!]

1209
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,230
[An eagle shot]

1210
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,810
[Their reactions!]

1211
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,480
[It's pay back time for
the reaction attack.]

1212
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,290
[Ah, so refreshing]

1213
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,260
[Why did you wear the sandal?]

1214
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,290
[They're the most talented
at laughing at other people.]

1215
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,100
[Jong Kook is the
third from the bottom.]

1216
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,360
Wow, all those cheeky people
are gathered together.

1217
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,070
We won't regret it even
if they take the prize.

1218
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,200
I feel so relieved.

1219
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,280
Seriously, I love Gyeongpo Beach!

1220
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,780
What a nasty word!

1221
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,560
We won the game anyway.

1222
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,960
Joo Hwan didn't play it yet.

1223
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,890
Joo Hwan!

1224
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,710
It's our last chance.

1225
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,270
Everyone's focused on you.

1226
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,050
[The seal is broken again.]

1227
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,600
[I'll defeat Eunhyuk]

1228
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,980
[and finish the game.]
All the camera is shooting for you.

1229
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,740
You've won other prizes, too!

1230
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,470
If you defeat Eunhyuk,
it'll be the jackpot.

1231
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,510
[Let's go!]

1232
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,340
[I'll finish this gam...]

1233
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,340
[We won!]

1234
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,400
[They don't care about
the score any longer.]

1235
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,960
[With one shoe,
everyone's cracking up.]

1236
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:40,070
[Farewell, my desire for victory...]

1237
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,240
[Shake, shake]

1238
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,970
[What's wrong with him?]

1239
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,510
Oh, my stomach hurts!

1240
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,710
[He made everyone laugh
and fails to be the winner.]

1241
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:54,810
It was so funny.

1242
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:58,090
Therefore...

1243
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,600
Jong Kook's team won!

1244
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,760
We did it!

1245
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,430
It was so funny.

1246
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,600
[Phew... I made it.]

1247
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,760
["Class is permanent!"]
How about Jong Kook vs. Joo Hwan?

1248
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,630
I feel so relieved.

1249
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,630
Thank you so much!

1250
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:22,510
The prizes are on the table.

1251
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:26,200
It's good to be Thanksgiving.

1252
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,430
We didn't win many games
but we have so many prizes.

1253
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,050
Is this it?

1254
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,380
Put them on the truck.

1255
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,890
[Is this really over?]

1256
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,890
Kwang Soo!

1257
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,760
[While everyone is dreaming
of a happy ending...]

1258
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,850
We have more than enough!

1259
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,200
There are a lot of
big ones over there.

1260
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,490
[Coming soon]

1261
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,450
[The secret mission is
put in front of them.]

1262
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:49,450
I'll go over there,
you go over there.

1263
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,970
[A surprising plot twist!]

1264
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,890
[The criminal is among them!]

1265
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,540
We caught them!

1266
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,740
[The amazing plot twist]

1267
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,510
[is starting now!]

1268
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,510
[They're heading to the next site
with a a load of gift sets.]

1269
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,940
We got a lot more though, right?

1270
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,050
We got less,
but ours are more expensive.

1271
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,830
[Quality over quantity!]

1272
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:14,090
We lost, but we still got more!

1273
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,490
[Thanksgiving should be
abundant with food.]

1274
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,490
The sunset is so pretty!

1275
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,050
[The sun is setting
on Geyongpo lake]

1276
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,670
[just like a painting.]

1277
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,740
[The members are entering
the mysterious mission site.]

1278
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,160
There's another game?

1279
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,360
I think there's
something at the end.

1280
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,140
[An empty, spacious area.]

1281
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,230
[What mission will they do here?]

1282
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,490
[He's getting ready.]
Something's going on...

1283
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:52,850
- I think we need to start running.
- Should I unfasten the seat belt?

1284
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,360
Do we have to get there first?

1285
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,050
I have no idea.

1286
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,090
You only need to go back to Seoul.

1287
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,670
You only need to go
home with your gifts.

1288
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:07,740
But since drowsy driving is a
problem these days

1289
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,250
so you can rest a bit before
you make your way back.

1290
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,140
You can take a nap until 7:30 p.m.

1291
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,690
[Take a nap?]

1292
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,630
[The mission is to sleep?]

1293
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,960
- You can sleep until 7:30 p.m.
- What time is it, now?

1294
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,980
- It's 6:30 p.m.
- For an hour.

1295
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
You want us to sleep?

1296
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,450
- Where?
- In this car.

1297
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:32,510
We have other cars in case
you're too squished.

1298
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:36,200
If it's too squishy, you can go to
the cars parked beside you.

1299
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,470
Really?

1300
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,650
- We just sleep?
- Why?

1301
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,910
Do we lose if we don't sleep?

1302
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,600
The mission is to sleep?

1303
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,830
We are giving you an hour to nap.

1304
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,870
Then, we are shutting
the cameras off now.

1305
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,270
- What's going on?
- We'll stop recording!

1306
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,490
One, two, three!

1307
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:57,650
[All cameras are off for an hour
except for the cameras on tripods.]

1308
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:01,540
[Have a good nap!]

1309
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,780
Does this make sense?

1310
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,090
[Confused]

1311
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,090
Eye patches?

1312
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:12,800
[There has got to be something...]

1313
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,510
I'm going to take a nap.

1314
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,480
[Big Nosed Brother doesn't hesitate.]

1315
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,620
[Goddess of sleep, Blank Ji
gets ready to take a nap.]

1316
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,960
[They put away their suspicion]

1317
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,570
[and go to dreamland.]

1318
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:48,140
[They don't know
what will happen next...]

1319
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,910
[It's getting dark slowly...]

1320
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,090
[Nap time is over!]

1321
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,180
[The current time is 7:30 p.m.]

1322
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,540
[We're carefully checking
if everyone's asleep.]

1323
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,980
[Everyone's in deep sleep.]

1324
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,340
[An alarm is going off.]

1325
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,450
[It's coming from here...]

1326
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,090
[Opens his eyes!]

1327
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:41,830
[At 7:30 p.m.
Im Joo Hwan gets up on time.]

1328
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:48,900
[Kwang Soo and Jae Suk in the
same car wake up at the same time.]

1329
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,270
[Blank]

1330
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,340
[The camera is recording...]
[Are we supposed to do something?]

1331
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,360
Do we run away?

1332
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,510
I think so.

1333
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,030
[They're getting ready to run?]

1334
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,140
[Shh!]

1335
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,830
[The other members
are still asleep.]

1336
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,860
[Come here.]

1337
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,290
[They put the other
members behind.]

1338
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,200
[And go to the secret rendezvous,
without knowing anything.]

1339
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,410
What is it?
What's this?

1340
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,410
What is it?

1341
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,880
Why are there so many cars?

1342
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:44,380
[What's with the secret rendezvous?]

1343
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:49,290
I will give a secret mission to
the three of you who woke up on time.

1344
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:53,310
[A secret mission?]

1345
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:56,270
You have two choices.

1346
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,500
You can steal all the gift sets

1347
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,140
to take for yourself,
while everyone else is sleeping.

1348
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,640
Or you can wait
until they're awake

1349
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,030
and you can share it, altogether.

1350
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,800
Are you going to run away
with all the gift sets?

1351
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,350
[Tempted]

1352
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:20,050
[What will their choice be?]

1353
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,380
We'll do that!

1354
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,310
[We don't have time to hesitate.]

1355
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,090
- Gwon Yeol, where are you?
- Right here.

1356
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,200
[Getting ready to run away]

1357
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,960
There's a carrier service
within Gangneung city.

1358
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,360
Find a box from the first site,
and ship it out at the second site.

1359
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,540
If you go in the right order,
you can take all the gifts.

1360
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,540
Hurry up and bring the gifts.

1361
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,160
[When successful,
they can take it all.]

1362
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,080
[Without delay,
they're headed to the gifts.]

1363
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,940
- Can we get them all at once?
- No, there are too many.

1364
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,450
We need to be quiet.

1365
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,250
[Jin Young is asleep.]

1366
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:03,250
[The Thanksgiving thieves trio]

1367
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:08,800
[They steal the gift without a hitch.]

1368
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,670
[Eunhyuk and Ha Ha are asleep, too.]

1369
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:17,450
[We've stole everything.]
[Shall we move them now?]

1370
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,780
[They stole everything at LTE speed.]

1371
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,690
[It's their first collaboration]

1372
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,400
[but they're a great match.]

1373
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,030
What is all this?

1374
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,690
Kwang Soo!

1375
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,960
What is happening?

1376
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,910
[Let's get out of here first!]

1377
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,030
[The thieves are running
away without delay.]

1378
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,330
Do we ship it out?

1379
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,780
So if we ship it to Seoul,
we can have it all...

1380
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,400
I think so.

1381
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,210
So if the others wake up, find us,
and rip our name tags... we're out.

1382
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,760
We have to run away...

1383
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,430
I hate being chased!

1384
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:00,670
I'm usually a chaser!

1385
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:04,200
[They picked it,
and they're complaining.]

1386
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,460
It is easier to chase...

1387
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,360
[Let's wake up, first...]

1388
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:19,160
[Current time: 7:45 p.m.,
five minutes passed.]

1389
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,490
[Red alert!]

1390
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,540
[What's this sound?]

1391
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,560
What's going on?

1392
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:36,510
[The siren is letting them know
of the thieves' runaway.]

1393
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,390
[Wake up]

1394
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:49,360
[He comes out without
knowing about the robbery]

1395
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,400
[that happened five minutes ago.]

1396
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,400
What is it?

1397
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,670
[Why isn't anyone in that car?]

1398
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:04,740
[Ha Ha suspects something,
and heads over to the car.]

1399
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,830
They took it all, and ran away!

1400
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,290
[The truck is empty.]

1401
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:11,400
Jae Suk

1402
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,230
Joo Hwan, and Kwang Soo are gone.

1403
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,000
[They didn't even leave
a single speck of dust...]

1404
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,850
They ran away!

1405
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,600
Jin Young!

1406
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,110
We got robbed!

1407
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,670
[What do you mean, robbed?]

1408
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,050
- We got robbed, Gary!
- What?

1409
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,910
The people in that car?

1410
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:33,290
The ones who woke up on time

1411
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:36,090
ran away to ship out the gift sets.

1412
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,690
There's a tracker
installed in that car.

1413
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:41,430
So who ran away?

1414
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,690
You can see their location.

1415
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,540
What happened?

1416
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,540
Catch them and eliminate them

1417
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,360
and they won't be
able to keep the gift sets.

1418
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,360
Thieves!

1419
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,140
Let's be on our way.

1420
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,230
Eunhyuk, Eunhyuk!

1421
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,560
[You shouldn't be sleeping!]
Yes?

1422
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,840
[Why is it so noisy?]

1423
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:10,760
- Someone stole our car.
- What?

1424
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,250
I mean, not the car.

1425
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,230
Let's take two cars.

1426
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,670
Don't you have another GPS unit?

1427
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:19,950
[He's in peace.]

1428
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,160
[What's going on?]
By two sedans?

1429
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,070
Yes, just drive sedans.

1430
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,340
I can't even sleep peacefully.

1431
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,580
I can't trust these guys.

1432
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,460
I knew it.

1433
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,430
I was wondering
why they told us to sleep.

1434
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,730
Guys...

1435
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,180
Let's go catch the thieves!

1436
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,810
"Thou shalt not covet."
Don't they know it?

1437
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:44,170
Let's call each other.

1438
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,180
Is it near Hansol elementary school?

1439
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,180
Where are they now?

1440
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,050
[Let's go!
Let's capture them all!]

1441
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,350
[At 7:50 p.m.]
[They start chasing out of anger.]

1442
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,990
What if they scatter around
and wait us at each site?

1443
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:06,600
They're moving.
Where are they going?

1444
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,280
They are on... Gangneung Bridge.

1445
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,240
Gangneung Bridge?

1446
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,410
I thought something was suspicious.

1447
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,940
It wakes me up.

1448
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:25,630
Did the three know from the beginning?

1449
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,180
- No.
- That's not it?

1450
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,920
They probably took the offer
when they got up at 7:30.

1451
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,350
We should have woken up at 7:30, then.

1452
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,560
[This is tiring.]

1453
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,830
They're all supposed
to wake up at 7:30.

1454
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,960
[They we didn't need to
betray them at all.]

1455
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,270
So, that's what
Kwang Soo's character is like.

1456
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes, Kwang Soo's always cheeky.

1457
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,410
[He looks cheeky even though
they're on the same side.]

1458
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,780
[Currently, 8:05 p.m.]
[They're arriving at the first site.]

1459
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:02,220
- Is it here?
- It seems like it.

1460
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,690
They will meet a dead end
if they stay on that road.

1461
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,780
We're pretty close to them.
Why don't you pick a place nearby?

1462
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:15,110
There's Ojukhun Rest Stop.

1463
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,430
They're near Ojukhun Rest Stop.

1464
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,910
They're near a dead end.

1465
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:24,290
They've stopped here.

1466
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,540
Which means, they got out of the car.

1467
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,200
They probably need to do something.

1468
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,310
Oh, they're doing their mission?

1469
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,450
[The thieves are arriving
at Gangneung artists' village.]

1470
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:37,960
I'll check this side.

1471
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,960
Okay.

1472
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,620
Where should I go?

1473
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,960
This side is large.
Let's search this side together.

1474
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,830
Kwang Soo and I are really bad at this.

1475
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,300
[The two skilled thieves are
bad at finding the 'R' box.]

1476
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,250
I'm not even joking.
We're the worst members for this.

1477
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,200
I'm terrible at finding 'R' marks.

1478
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,240
There're so many boxes!

1479
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,850
[Giraffe is also panicking.]
R mark...

1480
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,140
[Joo Hwan is struggling
finding the box all alone.]

1481
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,690
[We need to find the box
before the chasers arrive.]

1482
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,960
- It's not in here.
- Is it going to end here?

1483
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,760
[They're one kilometer away.]

1484
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,270
They're still not moving.

1485
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,940
They're doing something.
Maybe they need to box it up.

1486
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,600
- We're so close!
- Are we?

1487
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,050
- Look!
- We're here.

1488
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,050
We've almost caught them.

1489
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,400
It's exciting!

1490
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,800
- Break their arms.
- This is what Running Man is like.

1491
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,510
Make a left here.

1492
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:45,510
Yes, the navigation shows
that I have to make a left.

1493
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:46,510
Make a left here.

1494
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,860
[What are the thieves doing?]

1495
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,160
It'll be over if our name tags
get eliminated.

1496
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,070
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1497
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,850
- Did you find it?
- No.

1498
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:03,400
There are so many boxes
but I can't find the R box.

1499
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,140
I searched them, but couldn't find it.

1500
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,870
We'll get caught here.

1501
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,160
[But, It ain't over 'til it's over.]

1502
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,780
[The enthusiastic thief Joo Hwan
keeps searching and searching.]

1503
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,550
[He finds the R box.]

1504
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:26,050
[There're wrappers and tapes inside.]

1505
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:28,270
[I did it!]

1506
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,600
- Where did you find it?
- The room full of boxes.

1507
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,850
- I checked that room, too.
- It was on the top shelf.

1508
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,290
[Now, let's move to the final site!]

1509
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,600
[At 8:15 p.m.]

1510
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,300
[The thieves acquired
wrapping materials.]

1511
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:48,780
[At that moment...]
Isn't that the car?

1512
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,600
- That car over there?
- That's it.

1513
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,490
They parked in the shade.

1514
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,230
[We're here to capture you!]

1515
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,560
The car parked over here.

1516
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,560
- Where?
- That one in the front.

1517
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,390
They're here!

1518
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,780
That's the car!

1519
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,070
They're here, they're here!

1520
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,690
[The thieves were
able to get in the car.]

1521
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:22,090
- I should block the car with our car.
- Catch them!

1522
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,780
Wait, don't get out!

1523
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,960
- Eliminate their name tags!
- No, don't get out!

1524
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,230
Get back, get back!

1525
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,910
[The chasers are chasing them again.]

1526
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,510
They'll be caught soon!

1527
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:37,470
The destination, destination!

1528
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:40,960
[Changing direction all of a sudden]

1529
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:47,270
[To the final site,
they start the chase again.]

1530
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,850
I should have blocked their car.

1531
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,070
[VJ: What are we supposed to do?
How can I follow them?]

1532
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:03,750
[They left the filming staff behind.]

1533
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,670
Soon, a three-way intersection
should appear.

1534
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,450
They started moving again.

1535
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,650
- Are they following us?
- Yes.

1536
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:15,310
There's another car over there!

1537
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:20,370
[The chaser team two]

1538
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,540
Oh, they're right here!

1539
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,670
We got them!

1540
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:27,910
Wow, incredible!

1541
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:31,090
Jong Kook's car is right there.

1542
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,730
- Isn't that the chaser two?
- Yes, it is.

1543
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,720
[They're surrounded by the chasers.]

1544
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,140
Block them from the front!

1545
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,400
We would have blocked them
if we were in a movie.

1546
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,270
But..

1547
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:49,230
We can't go over the line.

1548
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,560
Hey, thieves!

1549
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,760
We're surrounded.

1550
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,430
Should we eliminate your name tags now?

1551
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,360
[You're scaring me.]

1552
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,540
Why did you do that?

1553
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,070
You took the holiday gifts?

1554
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,210
Don't look at them.

1555
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,210
Just ignore them.

1556
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:08,160
Pretend we don't know them.

1557
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,400
Just lock the door properly.

1558
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,910
[They're in a hurry, but they
follow the traffic signal.]

1559
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:17,200
They're still there.

1560
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,510
Unbelievable.
They came right next to me.

1561
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,740
Did we catch them too early?

1562
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,200
It's not that easy to
find them this quickly.

1563
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,160
They went far away in an area
that we don't know.

1564
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,600
I like our teamwork,
and Korean GPS devices.

1565
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:39,290
I was wondering
they must be near us...

1566
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,870
but they just pass by.

1567
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:46,980
We can find them with
a GPS device alone.

1568
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,090
Is there any way we can drop them?

1569
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:54,860
We're limited even
though it's a chasing.

1570
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,660
We can't really do it like movies.

1571
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,380
We still need to follow
the traffic act.

1572
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,850
I wish it was different than this.

1573
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,560
There's only one way.

1574
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,870
We need to keep driving

1575
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,070
until they don't have any more gas.

1576
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:12,010
What kind of a chasing is this?

1577
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:15,040
You follow the speed limit
and traffic signals.

1578
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,380
The thieves follow
the traffic signs well.

1579
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:25,350
If we let them go here,
we'll lose them forever.

1580
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:28,060
That must be the final mission site!

1581
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:31,290
- It should be!
- The stadium?

1582
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,530
The lights are on.

1583
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,830
It's right here!

1584
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:40,370
They need to stop here,
no matter what.

1585
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,040
They're supposed to come here.

1586
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:46,800
It's right here.

1587
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,250
They'll end up coming here.

1588
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,710
Let's hide here.

1589
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:53,550
I'll park this car somewhere else.

1590
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,870
I don't think all three of us
will be able to stay alive.

1591
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:01,290
While the car is running...

1592
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,560
one can get off and run to the site.

1593
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,380
That's right.
That's the only way.

1594
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:11,060
- We need to act fast.
- Run and block them.

1595
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:16,030
They'll be surprised if
we run all of a sudden.

1596
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:18,370
I'll be ready to run.

1597
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:22,110
Joo Hwan, we'll get the prize
if you write all of our names.

1598
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:26,070
If you can trust me,
I'll run to the spot.

1599
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:31,350
Kwang Soo, we need to block two cars.

1600
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,190
I think one person will get off
and the rest will stop us.

1601
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:39,790
And the other will run.

1602
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:43,090
Eunhyuk, you should run.

1603
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:46,860
And catch the person
who runs with the prize.

1604
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:51,770
Where's the site?
Is is inside the stadium?

1605
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,170
Jae Suk, on your left!

1606
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:56,540
Courier service!

1607
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,640
They might figure it out,
if we go near the truck.

1608
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,380
[Okay, they're finally here.]

1609
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,420
They're coming in.

1610
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,980
We need to stop them
while you write the invoice.

1611
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,950
I wonder if I'll have enough time.

1612
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:14,050
Maybe they will ship it
through the window.

1613
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,590
One is going to run.

1614
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,740
Should I carry
the prize and get off?

1615
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,670
I'll take the dried yellow corvina
and get off.

1616
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,840
- Should I catch him?
- I think they're giving up on him.

1617
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:32,310
[Here's dried yellow corvina set!]
Put it in our trunk.

1618
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,940
- Run to that side.
- Then, I'll start running.

1619
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:40,510
Eunhyuk, don't fasten
your seat belt, yet.

1620
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:44,050
Do not close the door
and put it in out trunk.

1621
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:47,090
Right now.
Run!

1622
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,260
[This is our only chance!]

1623
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,830
[Run!]

1624
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,430
[Running at full speed.]

1625
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,640
He's running, Eunhyuk.

1626
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,540
[The chaser with hot blood!]

1627
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,980
Eunhyuk is chasing him!

1628
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,580
[Blue: Ju Hwan]

1629
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:15,400
[Blue: Ju Hwan]
[Pink: Eunhyuk]

1630
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,020
[Joo Hwan arrives at the truck first.]

1631
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,590
[Only if he can write their names...]

1632
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:27,850
[Ji Hyo who was in ambush
tries arresting him.]

1633
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:31,470
[The siege is all around him.]

1634
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,200
- It's insane!
- They all got off.

1635
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:38,070
[Will the thieves get the prizes?]

1636
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:43,610
[Or will they be arrested?]

1637
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,980
[What will be the result?]

1638
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,540
[Joo Hwan's name tag]

1639
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,310
Im Joo Hwan is ousted!

1640
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,740
They're here.

1641
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:04,560
I was surprised!

1642
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:09,400
[The thieves are chased by Jong Kook.]

1643
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:12,270
What should we do?

1644
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,470
Ji Hyo and Suk Jin were
hiding right next to the truck.

1645
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,560
Jae Suk, I don't want it
to be ended like this.

1646
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,940
Joo Hwan is over.

1647
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,290
Joo Hwan is over?

1648
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:28,000
What should we do?

1649
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,400
They're here.

1650
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,600
Let's stop them right here.

1651
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,740
- Block them!
- Come over here, Jae Suk.

1652
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,270
Hello!

1653
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,710
[Their fantastic teamwork]

1654
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,560
Get off, Kwang Soo.

1655
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,160
Kwang Soo...

1656
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,980
It's too painful.

1657
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:52,380
Is this the end for us?

1658
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,270
Why did you get so greedy?

1659
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:58,920
You shall not steal others'.

1660
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:02,910
Should I put something
small in my pocket?

1661
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:05,850
I'm going to take one, then.

1662
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,930
Let's eat some dried persimmons.

1663
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,560
Let's have a dried persimmon.

1664
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,380
[Struggle, struggle]

1665
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,400
It's in the trunk,
and I can't reach it.

1666
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,140
[The chasers are convincing them.]

1667
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,540
One of you step out!

1668
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,540
- We won't catch you!
- Kwang Soo!

1669
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,670
- Just one of you!
- Kwang Soo!

1670
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:29,180
[How did we end up like this?]

1671
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,850
Please stop!
No more!

1672
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,400
No more!

1673
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,180
We'll stay afar.

1674
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,270
We'll step back,
but just one of you get out.

1675
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:45,270
What do you want, the meat?

1676
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:49,900
Kwang Soo, you get out that way.

1677
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,510
Get out, that way.

1678
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:59,280
[He's trying to sneak to the truck.]

1679
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,710
I will block them with the car.

1680
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,550
I'll get out!

1681
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:11,310
[Will they succeed this mission?]

1682
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:21,460
[With the car door slightly open,
he approaches]

1683
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,700
[and catches him.]

1684
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,830
It's over now!

1685
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:32,640
[Kwang Soo's out in a flash.]

1686
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:38,760
[Mr. Capable's speedy catch,
in the blink of an eye.]

1687
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,430
- I'll get out!
- Get out!

1688
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:44,490
[Big Nose is gathering
all the gift sets.]

1689
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:47,070
I'm getting out!

1690
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:49,710
[He takes out the invoice.]

1691
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,860
Suk Jin, what are you doing!

1692
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,600
Suk Jin!
[He tries stealing all of it.]

1693
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,690
[The employee is also flustered...]

1694
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:03,000
[What are you doing?]

1695
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:08,360
[Ji Suk Jin, out!]

1696
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,340
[Big Nose, who was blind
by the gift sets, is out.]

1697
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,710
What kind of person are you?

1698
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:19,790
[The atmosphere has gotten
looser thanks to Big Nose.]

1699
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:25,390
[This is my last chance!]

1700
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,990
Jae Suk, Jae Suk!

1701
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,630
[He goes for the final plot twist.]

1702
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,910
[It's still possible for
them to have it all.]

1703
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:41,110
[What will their fate be?]

1704
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:46,250
[Yoo Jae Suk, out!]

1705
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,070
You caught him?

1706
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:51,690
[The chaser win the final mission.]

1707
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,450
[The thieves have a miserable ending.]

1708
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,940
Get on your knees!

1709
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,200
You guys are really...

1710
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,510
They prepared the
gifts for Thanksgiving!

1711
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:09,250
I can't live like this!

1712
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,180
What's all this?

1713
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,470
We're innocent people!

1714
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,000
[At that moment, Big Nose is
heading to the truck again.]

1715
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:24,230
[Big Nose tries, once again.]

1716
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,690
You've been eliminated!

1717
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:27,470
He wants to take it all!

1718
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,630
I can't trust anyone anymore.

1719
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:33,000
- This is so funny!
- Wow, you're unbelievable!

1720
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,290
You're unbelievable!

1721
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,560
The invoice I gave,
is going to be shipped, right?

1722
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:39,050
The mischievous ones
who stole the gifts.

1723
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:41,490
[That's a little...]

1724
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:43,670
Everyone, except the three of you

1725
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:50,370
and Ji Suk Jin who got eliminated,
will share the gift sets.

1726
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,210
I knew it would turn out like this!

1727
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,150
I can be eliminated?

1728
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,480
Am I out?

1729
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,480
[People need to live kindly.]

1730
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,220
And honestly

1731
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:07,000
it wasn't even fair.

1732
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,780
We have to obey the traffic rules

1733
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,730
and obey all the laws.

1734
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:15,030
That's why, during the chase we said

1735
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,830
"they stole the gifts,
but they're obeying the traffic rules?"

1736
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:20,040
We had to!

1737
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,810
We wanted to block you,
but we were prohibited!

1738
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:24,440
We wanted to, so bad!

1739
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,910
[He's concluding, all of a sudden.]

1740
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:31,750
- Thanksgiving...
- You're pretending to be nice, now?

1741
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:36,320
[They don't appreciate him pretending
to be nice all of a sudden.]

1742
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,290
"Fellow viewers..."

1743
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:41,360
We will not steal
others' belongings.

1744
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,290
And live, kindly.

1745
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:48,230
Please have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

1746
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,670
I'll be heading home, now!

1747
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:53,100
[The chasers take
a load of gifts home.]

1748
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,340
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

1749
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,210
- Have a good Thanksgiving!
- See you in two years.

1750
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,270
- Oh my!
- Okay!

1751
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:03,780
[Eunhyuk, we hope you will
be back manlier in two years!]

1752
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,430
- Goodbye!
- Okay!
