70
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,670
Ji Suk Jin speaks a little rudely.

71
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,670
Why?

72
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,270
- You asked why he has two surnames?
- It's true!

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,990
Why do you have two
noses on your face?

Is it the family studies teacher?

81
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,350
She's not that pretty.

82
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,980

Be rational, and be careful

111

and keep a distance.

112
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,950
She must be a romance specialist.

113
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,780
Your ages are a little bit wonky.

114

- They left!
- What are we supposed to do?

131
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,370
Shouldn't some of the other
students come in, then?

132
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,340
Gary, you lead it.

133
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,170
I've never been
the class president...

134
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,410
How do I lead it?

135
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,680
Go to the front and
bring them in, one by one.

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
Would you please come in,
one by one?

- It's Ji Hyo!
- Boo!

142
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,090

president's girlfriend!

[Running High's first
female student, Song Ji Hyo.]

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,730
What did you bring?

145
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,100
She brought lunch boxes!

146
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,240
They said we were going
on a picnic today.

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,700
Really?

148
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,970

I brought some side dishes.

155
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,820
[And even some side dishes!]

156
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,990
It looks good!

157
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,590
Do I just sit next to
whoever I want?

158
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,830
[Now, shall I go find my soul mate?]

159

[Song Ji Hyo and Yoon Bak.]

168
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,610
Am I out?

169
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,620
Next student, please come in!

170
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,320
Who's the next student?

I have high hopes.

172
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,620
[I'm on my way to meet you!]

173
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,460
[Huh? That is]

[She will find her soul mate
at Running High!]

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,020
[Everyone gets up.]

179
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,980
[Full of joy]

180

- Stop lying!

184
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,070
[Burdensome]

185
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,310
- Do you have her phone number?
- Hello, my name is Park Han Byul.

186
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,690
Welcome One Star!
(Han: one, Byul: star)

187
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,780
I'm re-watching the
drama she was in.

188
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,150
- One star came here.
- My mom hates her so much.

189
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,090
Then you must not like me.

190
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,820
[Don't worry, we'll protect you!]

191
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,420
Many older women don't like her.

192
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,530
I brought these to wear
with my partner...

193
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm the only one without a hat!

194
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,460
[They're ready to wear the hat!]

195
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,930
I made lunch, as well as dessert.

196
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,030
[Introducing Han Byul's lunch.]

197
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,950
[The afternoon
before shooting day.]

198
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,710
I have prepared lunch to
eat with my partner.

199
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,240
Ta-da!

200
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,850
Fried tofu rice balls
and a shrimp salad.

201
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,650
And then on the bottom,
some fruit.

202
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,520
And then in the middle...

203
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,260
I have bought some Kimbap.

204
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,900
Do I just put it in?

205
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,200
Or should I re-arrange it?

206
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,270
The other way?

207
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,240
The rice was well made

208
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
so it was extremely delicious.

209
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,280
It seems as if I made it at home.

210
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,010
That's perfect!

211
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,710
[It's perfect!]

212
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,420
And it's complete!

213
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,120
[Is there anyone to
share this lunch with?]

214
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,790
One star!
One star!

215
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,760
[It's finally time to
choose her partner.]

216

Come here.

217
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,260
[I won't lose...]

218

[this chance.]

219

[Han Byul's choice is?]

220
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,940
[Park Han Byul and Yoo Jae Suk.]

221
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,840
[Excellent choice!]

222
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,810
[Depressed]

223
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,020
It's easier for me to get along
with someone I already know.

224
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,080
She's very shy!

225
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,580
Haven't you seen us on TV?

226
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,890
Okay, next up is...

227
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,050
- We'll bring in the next guest!
- I'm her fan, though!

228
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,420

It's Stephanie!

231

Phanie!

232
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
How have you been?

233
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,440
It's been a while!

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,140
Phanie, how have you been?

235
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,640
[She's getting an intense
welcome from them!]

236
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,010
Phanie!

237

[Automatic dance]

238
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,950

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
[She returned with a new
and improved look]

243
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
[on a variety show!]

244
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,100
I made a comeback as
a solo singer, Stephanie.

245
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,470
Nice to meet you.

246
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,810
Welcome, Stephanie!

247
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,950
Please show us your lunch.

248
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,280
- Please send me.
- It's different!

249
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,510
Did you pack all this?

250
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,090
Yes, I packed it.

251
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,240
Are you foraging through, now?

252
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,350
Don't forage!

253
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,560
Don't do it!

254
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,730
[Introducing Stephanie's lunch!]

255
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,910
[The night before the shoot.]

Hello everyone, I'm Stephanie.

257
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,670
I received an order
to pack a lunch.

258
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,280
You can freeze your beef

259
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,410
before frying it.

260
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,820

[Make the right size
of tofu rice balls.]

[Ta-da!
The complete lunch!]

266
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,740
It has to look good.

267
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,640
There's high quality beef, inside.

268
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,440
And some burdock, as well.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,180

[But her choice is?]

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,530
What are you saying?

272
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,390
You changed your mind
after 10 years?

273
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,090

277
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,310
Can I give up now?

278
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,020
Can I change now?

279
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,640
Yes, would you do that?

280
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,000
You shouldn't do this to me!

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,250
I'll just give you the hat back!

282
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,220

Hurry up and decide!

288
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,760
If it's too hard,
I'll just sit here for a bit.

289
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,470
- What are you doing?
- Don't do that!

290
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,090

is using physical contact.]

It's fried tofu rice balls again.

364
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,300
[Did you all buy it together?]

365
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,630
Oh!

366
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,440
She wrote their name.

367
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,940
[The name she wrote on the rice.]

368
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,140
His name?

369
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,080
I made it overnight.

370
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,210
My heart's fluttering!

371
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,150
[Joy's lunch,
made only for one person.]

372
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,550
- Joy!
- Oh, hi!

373
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:24,720
I started making this
as soon as I was done today.

374
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,230
I'm going to make egg fried rice.

375
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,500
I'm frying ham first.

376
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you doing it right?

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm just going by feel.

378
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,170
To be honest,
I don't know what I'm doing.

379
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,370
I am making some
fried tofu rice balls.

380
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,510
It looks good!

381
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,180
This is my lunch box!

382
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,510
You've filled it up.

383
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,320
Does it look like his name?

384
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,290
[You will accept my lunch, right?]

385
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,290
I put some side dishes in, too!

386
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,260
Wow, what time is it?

387
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,270
- Is it Kwang Soo's?
- Who's is it?

388
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,770
She made it without any sleep

389
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,540
so I don't think it's Ji Suk Jin's.

390
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,470
I agree.

391
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,370
Now, go!

392
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,010
[Joy, who prepared her
lunch for one person...]

393
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,710
I think it's Kwang Soo...

394
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,820
[Who will that person be?]

395
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,390
She's giving glances at everyone!

396
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,090
[Just then!]

397
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,630
[Joy and Lee Kwang Soo.]

398
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,530
[Happy vs. Sad]

399
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,570
[He's congratulating
without regret.]

400
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,970
[Huh? What's this?]

401
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,340
She wrote Giraffe on the rice.

402
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,810
[Oh my!]

403
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,410
This is the first time!

404
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,640
She wrote it?

405
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,210
[Fascinated]

406
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,880
It doesn't look like Giraffe.

407
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,550
You didn't mistake it
for Gary, right?

408
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,290
[Everyone's jealous
of Joy's pure love.]

409
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,720
Isn't it Gary?

410
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,120
Thanks, Joy.

411
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,990
[Touched]

412
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,320
This is so moving.

413
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm going to take this home.

414
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,530
You're not going to eat it?

415
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,660
Please come out!

416
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,400
[Who is the sixth guest?]

417
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,900
[Running High's sixth
female guest, Gong Seung Yeon.]

418
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,310
It's Gong Seung Yeon!

419
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,440
Oh, wow!

420
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,380
[With her elegant appearance,
and outstanding acting]

421
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,240
[she dominates over
ads and dramas!]

422
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,070
[I will find true love
at Running High!]

423
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,750
[Nice to meet you!]

424
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,890
It's so festive today!

425
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,670
There's hope!

426
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,860
[She's cute.]

427
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,290
[Oh my!]

428
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,430
[That's it?]

429
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,700
Doesn't it lack sincerity?

430
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,900
Isn't it frozen meat?

431
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,270
They're sausages.

432
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,440
Is that pickled radish?
What is that?

433
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,180
I think she added pickled radish,
but since it looked empty

434
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,780
she added pickles.

435
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,180
The leftover from
ordering pizza...

436
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,550
They're leftovers?

437
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,350
They're new from my fridge.

438
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,320
Hello, I am actress Gong Seung Yeon.

439
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,590
I am making a lunch right now.

440
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,530
I've been living alone
for a year, but

441
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,470
I never really cooked by myself.

442
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,500
I don't even have a rice cooker.

443
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,370
And no rice, either.

444
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,040
I'm making delicious
sausages, though.

445
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,510
So I hope you will
at least enjoy that.

446
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,180
Should I show you?

447
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,080
It's cooking well.

448
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,990
[That lunch turned out to be this!]

449
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,550
Did you force yourself to make it?

450
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,690
[I wish I could hide in a hole.]

451
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,390
There's one last box.

452
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,030
Oh, there's another one?

453
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,200
Did you two share?

454
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,700
Isn't that Joy's?

455
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,970
I think they'll stick
if they're put together.

456
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,970
[Dessert twins]

457
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,340

Okay, it's time to pick!

460
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,310
Yes, I will pick...

461
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,790
Kwang Soo.

[This is Giraffe's lucky day.]

Jong Kook, Ji Suk Jin, and Gary.

465
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,000
They've been very quiet.

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,930
I've never been this unpopular!

467
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,600
Kwang Soo, please sit over there.

468
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,470
[Gong Seung Yeon
and Joy sit side by side.]

469
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,010

going around in this room.

[Evacuation]

479
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,910
It's Na Rae!

480
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,620
Is something wrong?

481

What's wrong?

482
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,290

I can only see her face!

487
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,470
The viewers might think

488
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,040
that I'm being rude
and sitting down.

489
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,810

You brought a lunch, I'm sure.

492
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,620
Could we take a look?

493
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,240
Do you reveal it now?

No, no.

498
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,760
I haven't see that in a long time.

499
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,730
Wow.
She packed it herself.

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,700
You guys clean this up.
I don't know what to do.

548
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,870
Get out!

549
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,740
[Do you mean, me?]

550
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,540
I hate tall guys anyway!

551
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,810
Na Rae, stay here for a second.

552
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,080
[Temporary isolation]

553
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,280
[Kwang Soo's final choice]

554
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,580
[is Joy.]

555
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,120
Sorry, this is my spot.

556
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,060
[You're too much!]

557
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,860
[Stephanie and Jong Kook.]

558
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,910
[Gong Seung Yeon and Gary.]

559
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,640
[Park Na Rae and Ji Suk Jin.]

560
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,800
[Round one selection, complete.]

561
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,130
[Current partners]

562
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,370
- Should I lay it out?
- No, it's okay.

563
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,370
There's cream cheese.

564
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,910
It's good.

565
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,780
Wow, the sausage
you made is incredible!

566
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,220
You cooked it on
the frying pan, right?

567
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,320
[Embarrassed]

568
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,520
[They're opening the lunch boxes.]

569
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,920
[This is like a buffet.]

570
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,190
Kwang Soo seemed weak,
so I wanted to feed him.

571
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,700
Who could be weaker than me?

572
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,200
[Joy's tofu rice balls for Giraffe.]

573
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,070

having a secret date.]

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,440
Teacher Jung, say ah.

576
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,720
This is so good!

577
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,580
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes?

578
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,990
Do you know about the legend
that passes down in our school?

579
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,420
What legend?

580
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,390
Apparently there's a

581
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,890
legendary couple ring.

582
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,560
If you find the ring and put it on

583
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,470
then you will be
true lovers, forever.

584
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,340
I know that legend.

585
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,710
So if we find it and wear it

586
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,270
- we'll become partners for life?
- Yes.

587
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,470
We need to find the ring.

588
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,020
We will find it.

589
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,930
- We're only two.
- But we're a team.

590
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,590
We're on the same boat.

591
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,620
I'll give you victory.

592
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,190
I only have this day once a year

593
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,040
but today, I will give you victory.

594
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,930
Na Rae, Na Rae!

595
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,770
[The race starts now!]

596
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,940
[The first gateway of the
legendary couple ring race.]

597
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,510
Now that it's fall

598
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,540
it reminds me of my first love

599
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,010
that promised to
pick stars from the sky.

600
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,020
Please forget
about your past love.

601
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,090
Red sun!
(A famous hypnotizing line.)

602
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,130
From now on,
I will pick the stars from the sky

603
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,240
and even the stars on the ground.

604
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,090
Oh my goodness!

605
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,060
Why are there starfish here?

606
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,470
It's like a miracle!

607
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,330
That scared me!

608
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,070
It's such a mysterious thing!

609
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,840
Please give me stars!

610
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,510
You see the stars
on the ground, right?

611
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,250
We said we wanted to
see Stephanie's dance.

612
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,780
Should we get it going?

613
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,890
[Fall dance party]

614
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,790
[Let's party!]

615
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,500
[The beat is flowing under
the clear fall sky.]

616
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,460
First up, is Stephanie!

617
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,830
[Go, Stephanie!]

618
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,840
[Round and round]

619
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,240
[It's become a festival,
all of a sudden.]

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,910
[Heart is fluttering]

622
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,350
Stephanie hasn't changed!

623
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,090
They met a while ago!

624
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,560
[She's bringing back a retro dance.]

625
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,860
[From X-men to Running Man, she breaks
through the history of variety shows.]

626
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,530
[Bravo, Stephanie!]

627
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,360
[What do I do?]

628
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,970
- Next up is Joy!
- Joy!

629
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,670
[She warms up first.]

630
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,070
[Show us, show us!]

631
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,810
Wait for it!

632
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,550
It's coming, it's coming!

633
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,850
It's almost there!

634
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,990
[She miscalculated]

635
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,560
[Off beat]

636
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,130
[Not yet!]

637
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,600
[This time, it was off beat again.]

638
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,100
[Where is the chorus in this?]

639
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,640
Joy, you have to walk like an idol.

640
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,410
Like Beyonce?

641
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,780
[You wanted a girl group dance?]

642
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,920
[I will show you!]
[A proper girl group walking.]

643
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,320

[Release the zombie.]

[Her joints are
bending by themselves.]

647
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,430

[Dangerous poppin']

649
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,340

[She walks in cheery,
and does the crab dance.]

653

[It's so rare to see!]
[The crab dance of an actress!]

654
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,730
Why would you do that?

655
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,300
[It's a perfect finish!]

656
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,740
[Han Byul's turn!]

657
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,740
You need to forget your image.

658
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,680
Park Han Byul!
Park Han Byul!

659
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,510
[I'm already on it!]

660
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:35,890
[Han Byul's crab dance!]

661
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,630
[Her random dance is
almost funny as Ji Hyo.]

[The random dance duo]
They dance the same!

664
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,200
I said we're friends!

665
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,060
She dances like Ji Hyo.

666
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,770
They look like two drunk men!

667
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,340
Let's see Yoon Bak.

668
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,560
Yoon Bak!
Yoo Bak!

669
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,380
[A fan dance!]

670

[How will the sport climbing
world champion's dance?]

674
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,540
You should come forward.

675

[Where are you going?]

676
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,230
You don't have to do that!

677
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,140
[You don't have to
climb the street light!]

678
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,840
She must have felt so much pressure!

679
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,710
Why did you have to
put so much pressure?

680
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,480
Even a jimmy jib was recording.

681
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,280
Ja In's amazing!

682
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,450
We haven't had anyone like you
since Kim Byung Man.

683
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,550
I was wondering what you were doing.

684
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,350
We should play the
name tag elimination.

685
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,020
No one can eliminate her name ta.
She'll be stick to the ceiling.

686
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,560
Let's play the game.

Are you okay, Seung Yeon?

691
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,140
- Let me know if you're uncomfortable.
- I don't think I can walk.

692

[Rule: Pick up as many stars as possible
and put it in your basket.]

- Oh, no!
- No!

699
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,030
[While Ji Hyo and Yoon Bak
move slowly]

picking up the stars.]

[We won't be able to win
at this rate!]

[He carries Ji Hyo on his back
and crawls as he picks stars.]

705

[Dauntless warrior, Yoon Bak]

708

[He has full of stars in his hands.]

709

That's something new!

710
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,990
That's new!

711
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,060
[The crawling team is in the lead.]

712
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,700
[We're falling!]

713
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,530
How can we get up?

714
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,540
Let's get up!
One, two, three!

715
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,410
I can't get up.

716
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,250
What are we supposed to do
for getting up?

717
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,520
Joy, here are the stars.

718
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,000
[Meanwhile, thanks to Joy's flexibility
they're getting stars.]

719
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,960
You need to get to your basket!

720
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,590
Joy, let's put them in the basket!

721

[Yoon Bak and Ji Hyo
finally stand up.]

722

Gary, get to your basket!

724
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,330
Where's the basket?

725
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,070
Let's not touch other people's basket!

726
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,100
Play the game!
Why not?

727
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,210
[Yoon Bak and Ji Hyo put the stars
get ready for a physical fight.]

728
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,040
[Ji Hyo's still collecting.]

729
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,980
Flip Kwang Soo's basket
and win!

730
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,650
[Cut it out!]
[Do you know how to stand up?]

731
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,020
We're not a good team!

732
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,650
No, not my basket!

733
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,990
Bak, flip Kwang Soo's
basket and win!

734
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,990
[That's a foul!]

735
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,740
[A fatal accident!]
Oh, no!

736
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,510
[Joy kicks her own basket
when the buzzer goes off.]

737
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,010
I didn't kick it!

738
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,550
[It wasn't a foul.]
[The counting for the first round.]

739
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,850
One, two, three!
[For Kwang Soo and Joy]

740
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,350
Gary's team has nothing.

741
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,690
Yoon Bak and Ji Hyo has

742
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,460
two, four, six, seven.
Yoon Bak's team won!

743
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,160
[They won the first round.]

744
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,830
[The Columbus of games, Yoon Bak]

745
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,930
[Their crawling strategy worked!]

746
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,970
Yoon Bak used his wits.

747
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,900
It's the final round!

748
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,300
Let's go!

749
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,540
It doesn't fit.

750
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,040
- We're starting the final round now?
- Yes, we are.

751
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,880
[Suk Jin and Na Rae
won the second round.]

752
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,980
- Did you take off your shoes?
- Yes, it's easier.

753
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,610
Good job.

754
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,190
[Can we beat the monsters?]

755
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,420
Get ready!

756
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,060
Set, go!

757
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,230
[The final round starts!]

758
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,100
[Swoosh]

759
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,930
You're not supposed to do that!

760
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,070
There he goes again!

761
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,700
[We knew Kkuk is like a monster]

762
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,910
[but Stephanie is so flexible!]

763
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,140
She can bend like that?

764
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,910
That's not funny at all.

765
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,350
[It's not possible to defeat them...]

766
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,140
Wow, she can do that!

767
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,010
[He picks, and picks.]

768
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,290
[Their basket is full of stars.]
Kim Jong Kook!

769
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,820
[Yoon Bak starts picking up
the stars, super fast.]

770
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,500
[I can't lose!]

771
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,960
[He's so fast!]

772
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,670
It looks like Na Rae
came here with her work manager.

773
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,500
[It's a company fall outing!]

774
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,440
[Ji Hyo and Yoon Bak's
basket is full of stars, too.]

775
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,040
You need to give them
20 minutes!

776
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,880
Yoon Bak collected a lot, too.

777
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,350
I wonder who will win.

778
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,120
Get up.

779
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,220
[At that moment]

780
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,860
[Ill-tempered Big Nose
attacks Jong Kook and Stephanie.]

781
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,010
What is this?
What happened?

782
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,070
[What a windfall!]

783
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,230
Good job, you flipped it!
[What happened?]

784
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,570
I didn't do it!

785
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,950
Are we going to continue this game?

786
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,440
We just need to protect
our basket, Ji Hyo.

787
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,440
Yoon Bak is smart.

788
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,810
- It's not us, Jong Kook.
- Let's give up, Na Rae.

789
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,720
[And the time's up.]

790
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
The fact that we won
last time is more weird.

791
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,520
We don't even need to count them.

792
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,690
Therefore, Yoon Bak and Ji Hyo win!

793
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,560
The two of you can come
forward and receive it.

794
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,730
You might not be partners later.

795
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,340
- What's inside?
- They're different hints?

796
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,040
Maybe they're different.

797
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,070
Huh?
This is a hint?

798
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,410
[Ji Hyo's hint - "Green K"]
[Yoon Bak's hint - "Soe with a heart"]

799
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,810
Like I said before,
the winners are

800
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,650
Ji Hyo said she will break us apart.

801
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:32,390
Except us and Suk Jin's couple,
everyone will rotate.

802
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,190
- Why?
- To the left.

803
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,480
[Why not us?]
Ja In...

804
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,600
[They have to
be separated.]

805
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,980
- You look so happy.
- It's not true.

806
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,740
- Ji Hyo...
- What about us?

807
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,670
Just stay as a couple.

808
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,370
It drives me crazy.

809
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,870
- Get moving!
- Come here!

810
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,640
We're bored with each other
from the start.

811
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,580
Don't even think
about winning the race.

812
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,350
We meet again.

813
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,920
[It's new and awkward again.]
[Let's go to the next mission site!]

814
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,620
[Current partners]

815
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,060
- Miss Hwang.
- Yes?

816
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,390
- To make a return for your lunch...
- Yes.

817
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,570
I brought this.

818
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,070
Thank you.

819
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,240
[Bite]

820
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,410
It's so sweet.

821
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,050
You should try, too.

822
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,220
It's okay, you like ice cream.

823
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm okay.

824
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,490
[She pushes it.]

825
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,190
Thank you.
[Cough, cough]

826
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,300
You're enjoying it.

827
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,130
[Miss Hwang...
Mr. Jung...]

828
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,580
[I think we can connect
without any words.]

829
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,470
It's like I'm back to
when I was a young girl.

830
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,340
To be a young girl, you're too...

831
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,010
[After the first couple game]

832
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,150
What's this?

833
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,950
- What is it?
- It's interesting.

834
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,680
- Kimbap!
- Maybe it's like pinball.

835
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,840
- Are all the men here?
- Yes.

836
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,630
Did you enjoy the lunch
your partner brought?

837
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,160
- Yes.
- This time, male students will

838
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,470
make kimbap for your partners.

839
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,570
- What's this?
- I'm good at making kimbap.

840
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,600
The thing is, this
is "kimbap of fortune."

841
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,370
We'll give you rice and laver,
but the rest

842
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,780
are in the vending machine
in front of you.

843
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,450
- You'll put tennis balls.
- That looks fun!

844
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,350
You'll get the ingredients by luck.
[They're given three chances.]

845
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,320
There's wasabi, too!

846
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,580
There's garlic, too!

847
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,390
- It's raw!
- Raw garlic!

848
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,890
Chocolate?

849
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,920
Saury and chocolate together...
It must be the worst!

850
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,490
[Horrifying ingredients are
side by side the normal ones.]

851
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,760
There're gummy worms, too.

852
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,300
If you use fresh garlic
and wasabi together...

853
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,260
But, wasabi as an ingredient
is too much.

854
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,570
[Is that a reward of a punishment?]
I'm not sorry.

855
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,300
[In the meantime, the female
students are upstairs.]

856
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
What are they doing now?

857
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,770
They're making a gift for you.

858
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,670
The new partners are?

859
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,180
My partner is quiet old
for that kind of stuff.

860
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,750
I feel uncomfortable.

861
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,750
[Na Rae, I might feel
even more uncomfortable.]

862
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,150
Do we just throw balls in there?

863
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,540
I think the unlucky
people should go first.

864
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,690
Then, I'll do it first!

865
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,030
- Which means Ji Suk Jin, Lee Kwang Soo...
- Yoo Jae Suk.

866
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,800
Who will go first out of three?

867
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,590
The unluckiest, Kwang Soo will!

868
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,160
- I'll do it first!
- There're more of good ingredients.

869
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,980
Get ready, set

870
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,510
[For his new partner,
Stephanie...]

871
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,690
Ready, set, go!

872
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,940
[The icon of misfortune]

873
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,820
- I wonder how unlucky he is.
- Dud!

874
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,920
[The ball keeps changing
its direction.]

875
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,060
[No way...
I won't be unlucky with this game.]

876
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,820
[Kwang Soo's ball is moving
toward pork cutlet.]

877
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,320
[Is he going to break
his serious of misfortune?]

878
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
[Kwang Soo's first ingredient!]

879
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,780
Dud!

880
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,670
- Dud, dud!
- Dud!

881
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,870
[That was close.]

882
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,210
- Indeed!
- You're unbelievable!

883
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,750
He's the unluckiest of all.

884
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,220
[He's always unlucky.]

885
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,380
Try doing it at the end this time.

886
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,980
Ready, set

887
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,780
go!

888
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,790
If he picks wasabi
or fresh garlic.

889
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,120
He might get another dud.

890
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,660
[Another dud?]

891
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,460
Dud!
[It really happened!]

892
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,300
[This can't be real...]

893
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,000
[It's rather frightening.]

894
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,710
How could it be even possible?

895
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,210
If he picks wasabi this time...

896
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,480
I can't eat cilantro!

897
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,680
Maybe pork cutlet and cream cheese...
Fresh garlic!

898
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,180
It's fast!

00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,700
Taste it.
[Saury and pork cutlet]

1074
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,230
Feed her!

1075
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,270
Because they can see what it is.

1076
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,570
This looks good.

1077
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,870
- Pork cutlet?
- They should close their eyes.

1078
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,870
It's okay.

1079
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,570
That should taste good.

1080
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,310
His ingredients weren't bad.

1081
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:40,220
[How will it taste?]

1082
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,950
- Is it okay?
- It's so good!

1083
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,120
- Really?
- Yes.

1084
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,790
Really?
Let me taste it.

1085
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,720
- It's good.
- Is it?

1086
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,460
[It's not bad.]

1087
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,690
Gary.

1088
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,630
He removed the fish skin, too.

1089
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,370
The flavor of sesame oil, though.

1090
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,770
[Gary's kimbap]
[Saury, chocolate, spinach]

1091
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,440
Don't smell too much.
Eat the middle piece.

1092
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,770
Try it, Ja In.

1093
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,640
It's okay.
It's not bad.

1094
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,150
Chew it properly.

1095
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,080
How is it?

1096
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,920
It's not bad,
but it's not good.

1097
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,320
How would you describe the taste?

1098
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,460
Salted lollipop.

1099
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,290
Wow, that's precise!

1100
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,600
She's like a poet.

1101
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,300
Because it has saury and chocolate.

1102
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
What did you say?

1103
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,170
[Saury and chocolate?]

1104
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,470
I'm telling you, this isn't the worst.

1105
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,040
I'll tell you.

1106
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,910
That one is blessed.

1107
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,210
Kim Jong Kook is the next.

1108
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,010
[Han Byul's tasting time.]

1109
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,280
[Cream cheese,
uncooked garlic, cilantro]

1110
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,850
That looks good!

1111
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,590
Wow, that looks different!

1112
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,760
[Frown face]
How is it?

1113
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,320
Can you taste the cilantro?

1114
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,160
Tell him honestly.

1115
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,600
[How should I describe this?]

1116
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,400
How does it taste?

1117
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,130
But...

1118
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:13,170
- you can still eat it...
- Wow, she's nice.

1119
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,670
You can still eat it,
but you wouldn't, right?

1120
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,640
You won't be able to talk today.

1121
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,850
Oh, garlic!

1122
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,710
[It's Ha Ha's turn]

1123
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,980
Joy is blessed.

1124
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,550
[Pork cutlet, sweet pickled radish,
and crab meat]

1125
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,120
Joy is lucky.

1126
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,020
It's good that your
partner got changed.

1127
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,470
[Wow, delicious!]

1128
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,930
Maybe you saved your country
in your former life.

1129
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,000
Can I have one of your pickled radish?

1130
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,360
[I want to get rid of the odor.]

1131
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,470
It's not going to help!

1132
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,770
- Seriously, isn't that good?
- Yes.

1133
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,570
[Getting a normal ingredient wasn't
easy at all, but he has all three.]

1134
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,340
Sweet pickled radish,
pork cutlet, and crab meat!

1135
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,070
- Seung Yeon's turn.
- That looks cute.

1136
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,180
Something looks red.

1137
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,610
For your information, these are
Running Man's three unluckiest members.

1138
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:06,640
But mine is a little better
than these two.

1139
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,160
- Really?
- Really.

1140
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,030
- What's that?
- Isn't that a gummy bear?

1141
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,830
What did you eat?

1142
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,870
Seung Yeon, how is it?

1143
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,870
- I think it's spicy.
- Yes, it's wasabi!

1144
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:24,810
[Bingo!
It's wasabi!]

1145
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,480
And hers is better than ours?

1146
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,050
- How's the taste?
- I don't think I can eat it again.

1147
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,780
[Chocolate, gummy worms,
wasabi]

1148
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,690
The next taster is Stephanie.

1149
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,220
You're so unlucky.

1150
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,320
No, it's not that bad.

1151
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,730
[Salted shrimps]

1152
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,800
What's this?

1153
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
[Decoration to express the giving sea]

1154
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,010
- That's a comb.
- I thought it's a relic.

1155
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,280
You can use it as a comb.

1156
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,310
[She eats it in one bite.]

1157
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:05,650
It's not that bad, is it?

1158
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,380
I feel so bad for Stephanie.

1159
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,590
Are you okay?
It's not that bad, right?

1160
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,490
[Outburst]

1161
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,360
[Why are you giving me
such a hard time?]

1162
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,460
[She's dizzy.]

1163
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,180
I've never rolled a kimbap in my life.

1164
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,500
[No more excuses, just eat it.]

1165
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,710
[Kwang Soo is
apologizing with his face.]

1166
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,310
Na Rae, you know
why you're the last person.

1167
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,840
[Oh my god!]

1168
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,550
Is this the worst kimbap?

1169
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,410
It looks nice.

1170
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,080
The visual isn't that bad, right?

1171
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,690
Try it, Na Rae.

1172
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,950
Eat it at once.

1173
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,160
It'll be good.
I think it's fine.

1174
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,520
It should be okay.

1175
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,460
[God!]

1176
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,160
Oh, no!

1177
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,300
[Chocolate, crab meat,
and cilantro]

1178
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,970
[Joy is the lucky girl.]

1179
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,770
She has the most delicious kimbap.

1180
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,170
[After the fun snack time]

1181
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,780
[A fairy tale passed
down at Running High]

1182
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,550
[About the legendary couple rings,
that let you win your love forever.]

1183
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,690
[We're on the way to find the legend.]

1184
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,690
[They're on the way to
the final mission site.]

1185
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,490
You don't have any hints, Han Byul.

1186
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,660
[After the snack time,
they played a baseball game.]

1187
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,700
[Jae Suk and Seung Yeon win
and they changed partners again.]

1188
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,330
This hat belongs to you.

1189
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,900
That's right!
[He's happy.]

1190
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,510
The hint I have is...

1191
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,170
[Right before they arrive at the site]

1192
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:45,140
[It's at the hallway
on the fifth floor.]

1193
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,450
I think this is the best hint.

1194
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,770
Hallway on the fifth floor.

1195
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:51,430
[Seung Yeon has the same hint.]
Hallway on the fifth floor.

1196
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,550
Jae Suk and I received the same hint.

1197
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,460
Ji Hyo and Yoon Bak
have a different hint.

1198
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,790
Different from us, too.

1199
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,890
- A heart?
- A heart with "Soe"

1200
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:04,960
(from "Yeolsoe" (key),
"Soe" itself means "metal")

1201
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,030
It might be a key,
or metal key holders?

1202
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,800
[They're guessing the imperfect hint.]

1203
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,800
[They go to the final site
with their last partner.]

1204
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:18,150
[At that time, the teachers...]

1205
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:21,530
Is everyone studying hard?

1206
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,530
[Stops abruptly]

1207
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,650
They're supposed to be studying.
Where are they?

1208
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,710
Mr. Jung!

1209
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,800
They didn't, did they?

1210
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,850
Miss Hwang, I think they went to
find the legendary couple rings

1211
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,130
when they should be studying!

1212
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,820
- Let's go get them.
- Wait a moment.

1213
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,710
Mr. Jung...

1214
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,720
I'll bring the student council members.
They're like my children.

1215
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,000
Wait, calm down!

1216
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,070
Student council!

1217
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,000
Wait a moment, please.

1218
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,690
[She's ready to bring 300 students.]

1219
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,750
She's so lovely.

1220
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,250
Miss Hwang!

1221
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,290
[They're ready to chase.]

1222
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,720
Let's go!

1223
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:11,270
[Look at them...]

1224
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,160
[They look strong!]

1225
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,500
Let's go.

1226
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,300
- Which way?
- That way!

1227
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,030
[The students who left
school early are...]

1228
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,070
We're going to search
for it without any hints?

1229
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,070
What can we do?
We didn't get any hints.

1230
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:34,890
[Each team is searching
for the ring alone.]

1231
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,480
Maybe it's on the floor.

1232
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,180
[Are they dating or
carrying out the mission?]

1233
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,180
[Huh?]
[They're tied to each other!]

1234
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,560
[One minute ago]
While you were eating lunch

1235
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,760
- female students told you something.
- The legend.

1236
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,570
The legendary rings!

1237
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,370
Somewhere in this building,
there's a treasure chest.

1238
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,670
You need a key to open the chest.

1239
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:04,040
Find the key to open the treasure chest

1240
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,480
and get the couple rings inside.

1241
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,180
They're diamond rings.

1242
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:14,020
[What a restorative announcement!]

1243
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,390
[She's full of energy.]
It's embarrassing!

1244
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,420
This makes me look bad.

1245
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,930
She told me that

1246
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,060
she's going to sell it on eBay
if she wins the prize.

1247
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,630
You need to wear the rings.

1248
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,690
And that's not it.

1249
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,650
You need to wear them
and go to the platform.

1250
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,110
The couple who gets there safely

1251
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,100
and stands on the platform
will win the race.

1252
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,960
The problem is...

1253
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,170
in five minutes

1254
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,180
the two teachers and
the student council members

1255
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,580
will chase you
while wearing a bell.

1256
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,820
That sounds scary!

1257
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,050
Why make it so scary?

1258
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:51,190
If they break your bracelet,
you'll be ousted.

1259
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:58,470
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo's hint]
["Green K"]

1260
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,100
Should we go to the rooftop?

1261
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,070
What is green?

1262
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,570
What is "Green K"?

1263
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,810
The hint that I gave you
after the first game is

1264
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,110
about the key.

1265
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,880
It was divided into two parts.

1266
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,740
[Yoon Bak and Joy
have "Seo with heart."]

1267
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,210
I'm scared.

1268
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:28,360
Wait, what's the meaning of the hint?

1269
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,360
I think it's the shape of the key.

1270
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,540
I think the first hint was the shape.

1271
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,270
And the second one is the location.

1272
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,340
So, where the treasure chest is.

1273
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,600
Ha Ha received the second hint...

1274
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,610
Where's Ha Ha?

1275
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,110
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon's hint is
"Hallway on the fifth."]

1276
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,450
[They're searching on the fifth floor.]

1277
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,920
[Maybe the treasure chest is here.]

1278
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,930
[They've found a key with a red heart.]

1279
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:02,920
[They were looking for the chest,
but they found a key.]

1280
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,460
[Too excited...]

1281
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:12,030
[It's nothing, unless it's the
key with a green heart.]

1282
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,800
Let's go downstairs.

1283
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,910
Where's the key...
[They want to find the key first.]

1284
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,440
Is it in this building?

1285
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,950
[They need to find the key
before the teachers arrive.]

1286
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,820
[Jingle-jangle]

1287
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,620
They're downstairs!

1288
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,330
[Jingle-jangle]

1289
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:42,830
They're already here?

1290
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,670
[She changed to sneakers
to chase the students.]

1291
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,950
["Class is forever..."]

1292
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,780
Student!

1293
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,950
[If they oust all the students,
the teachers will win the ring.]

1294
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:09,320
[Run]
Student!

1295
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:16,660
[Mr. Jung's also wearing sneakers.]

1296
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,570
[Finding Students]

1297
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,970
[Jingle-jangle]

1298
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,410
[You better hide well,
because I can see your hair.]

1299
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:35,370
Let's just wait here
until we can't hear the bell.

1300
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,520
This is a large building,
how did they get down so fast?

1301
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,220
I'll change the plan.

1302
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,860
We'll start from the top,
and go down to the bottom.

1303
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,020
We'll use the dragnet method.

1304
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,450
[Dragnet: A net drawn
through a river or across.]

1305
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,820
[A systematic search for someone,
especially criminals.]

1306
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:58,970
[I can feel someone is here...]

1307
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,580
I was startled!

1308
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,290
I was scared to see myself!

1309
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,120
I didn't know I could be this scary.

1310
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,250
[Ashamed]

1311
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,550
I was scared to death.

1312
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:23,240
I've never been so surprised
to see myself before!

1313
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,690
Student!

1314
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,930
[Embarrassed]

1315
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,590
They're not here.

1316
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:35,070
[Gary and Ja In search
without a hint.]

1317
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:38,610
- Where could it be?
- I'm scared.

1318
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,280
Let's go downstairs.

1319
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:49,080
[Maybe they will meet
a team with a hint.]

1320
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,610
[Huh?]

1321
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,820
[Maybe they'll have a
counseling session first!]

1322
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,610
[Please, let us go!]

1323
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,180
[Where are you going?
You need to have a make-up class!]

1324
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,470
No!

1325
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,930
[Dating is prohibited!]

1326
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,730
[Gary, go out and get some air!]

1327
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,630
I really love you, Gary.

[Their dream of winning
the ring broke.]

1330
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,650
[Gary and Ja In are ousted!]

1331
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,930
Do you want to check the basement?

1332
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,730
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo
came down to the fourth floor.]

[Jingle-jangle]

1334
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,340

[It's getting closer!]

1336
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,280
[Horrifying]
Where's the sound coming from?

1337
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,380
[They decide to go down.]

1338
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,080
Can you stand over here?

1339
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,940
[What are you talking about?]

1340
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,450
- You can block them.
- Shh...

1341
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,740
<i>This is floor P1.</i>

1342
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,960
<i>The door will open.</i>

[Come back inside!]

1345
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,670
[It's full of bells here, too.]

1346
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,750
This drives me crazy!

1347
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,490
They were right next to us!

1348
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:22,140
I think they're on the P1
and the first floor.

1349
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,350
Let's find a hiding spot.

1350
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:29,150
I don't know why,
but it's so scary.

1351
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,420
We can't both fit in there.

1352
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,550
- You can hide.
- I can.

1353
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:40,530
[They came to the auditorium.]
We'll be ousted if we get caught.

1354
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,330
How about behind the curtain?

1355
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:49,940
It's the wall.
I can tell there's someone hiding.

1356
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,540
It's too obvious!
120 percent!

1357
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,640
- Can you tell?
- I can't see you.

1358
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,180
You can't see us, right?

1359
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,250
If we get caught, give me the camera.

1360
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,880
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo get off the
elevator on the fifth floor.]

1361
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,790
- Is there only one key?
- I think there're many.

1362
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,660
[Then enter the corner room
at the end of the hallway.]

1363
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,890
Only one key will...

1364
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,800
It there another one?

1365
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,300
[They found a key with a green star]

1366
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,550
[and a key with a red heart.]
We need to find as many as possible.

1367
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,970
Kwang Soo, I feel uneasy
when we get off on the right foot.

1368
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,280
I'll do my best today!

1369
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,240
I can't let this opportunity pass!

1370
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:38,620
[It's not a hallway?
There's another door!]

1371
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,510
What's that?
[They found the treasure chest.]

1372
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:47,730
[At last, they found
the treasure chest!]

1373
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:49,780
Let's open it with the keys we have.

1374
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,600
It doesn't fit.

1375
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,030
It doesn't fit at all.

1376
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,770
It has to be smaller than this.

1377
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:06,280
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
also enters the room.]

1378
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,580
[That's Giraffe!]

1379
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,150
Let's keep the key
so we can compare the size.

1380
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,690
It didn't fit at all.

1381
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,090
Ha Ha, wait...

1382
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:27,700
[We already saw everything.]

1383
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,890
Did you open it?

1384
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,500
No, we didn't.

1385
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,980
[Why would they still be there,
if they did?]

1386
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,070
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
have a key with a red heart.]

1387
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,470
You found a key?

1388
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,880
That's not it.

1389
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,280
Let's not attack each other!

1390
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,350
It doesn't fit.

1391
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,880
[They thought they could open it
as soon as they found the chest.]

1392
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,250
It wouldn't be this easy.

1393
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,960
We need to find the right key.

1394
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,730

have the hint for the fifth floor.]

in the corner room.]

1400
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,080
What do we do?

1401
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:20,280
[Lock]

1402
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,450
[They go back to the corner room
from the secret room.]

1403
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,550
They're so scary.

1404
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,950
[Let's get out of here.]
It's locked!

Right out side of the door.

- Who's there?
- Open the door, Jae Suk.

Open the door!
[Oh, I know who it is.]

01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,680
It's Jung Kyung Ho.

- Suk Jung!</i>

01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,860
It doesn't sound like Suk Jung.

1418
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,470
But maybe they captured someone...

1419
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,770
Tell me who you are.

1420
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,100
I'm Dong Hun!
Ha Ha!

1421
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,740
We're trapped!

1422
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,810
Why are you upset?
Is this a door?

1423
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:27,850
[They finally opened the door.]

1424
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,600
Here's the treasure chest.

1425
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,010
You know the lock...

1426
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,450
It's connected.

1427
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:37,120
You need to open the chest
with a key.

1428
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,460
[Is that it?]

1429
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,460
- There's the treasure chest.
- Let's go together.

1430
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,340
If you have a key,
you can try opening it.

1431
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,320
Then, we'll try and come back.

1432
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,800
If you win the ring,
give us a half.

1433
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,360
[Deeply moved]

1434
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,200
Maybe we'll win the ring now!

1435
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:04,090
[A key with a yellow heart
and a red heart]

1436
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,470
This doesn't even fit.

1437
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,630
[If it's not the key with the green heart,
it's not going to open it.]

1438
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,920
[Who will find the right key?]

1439
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:22,070
Where's the CCTV room?

1440
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,890
There are CCTVs in there?

1441
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,410
Excuse me.

1442
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,710
They're nowhere...

1443
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:40,920
[She found Giraffe.]

1444
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,720
He's here.
Where is he?

1445
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,220
He's in the elevator.

1446
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,820
That's the elevator.
What floor are they?

1447
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,430
[They're like a rat in a trap.]

1448
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,600
I'm going insane, Kwang Soo!

1449
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,560
My heart is beating so fast!

1450
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,850
<i>The door is opening.</i>

1451
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,960
[Peek-a-boo!]

1452
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,170
Wait, Miss Hwang!
Listen to me!

1453
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:14,520
[This is 100 times scarier
then getting caught as a student.]

1454
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,520
[Horrifying]

1455
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,520
It's okay.

1456
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,290
Miss Hwang, please!

1457
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:27,760
[Powerful discipline]

1458
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,070
I can't help it!

1459
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,730
[She broke the couple.]

1460
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,640
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are ousted.]

1461
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,750
[Suk Jin and Na Rae have
eloped for an hour.]

1462
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,840
Let's go to the jail
and ask what the hint is.

1463
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,150
We have no clues at all.

1464
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,520
Can you tell us the hint?

1465
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,850
[Yoon Bak and Joy
are about the enter the jail.]

1466
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,760
A key?

1467
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,560
You don't know the location?

1468
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,730
You don't.

1469
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:03,060
You need to find a secret room.

1470
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,270
Just check all the rooms.

1471
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:12,770
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon think the same.]
Kwang Soo is over there.

1472
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:14,470
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are ousted.

1473
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:17,080
[They're entering the jail.]

1474
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,850
They're ousted?

1475
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,850
[Will they give them the hint?]
We found a key.

1476
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,680
It's the red key.

1477
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,150
Kwang Soo, why are you lying?
He's lying.

1478
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,190
Ha Ha, my hint was...

1479
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,760
"Green K."

1480
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,100
Green key?

1481
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,800
We guessed it's a green key.

1482
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,630
Then it means a green key.

1483
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,730
- There should be...
- It's red.

1484
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:46,540
- You've already ousted!
- Why would you tell him?

1485
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,040
I hope everyone fails.

1486
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,510
We can't win the race.

1487
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:53,640
Thank you, Ji Hyo!

1488
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,910
Be careful, Ha Ha!

1489
01:12:55,910 --> 01:13:01,290
- Why would you lie until the end?
- We've searched for it all day.

1490
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:05,060
We're already ousted.
Let the students win.

1491
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,890
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
are searching for a green key.]

1492
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,300
[They searching from the corner again.]

1493
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:19,100
[It's an empty box.]
Someone took it.

1494
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,340
[We will never give up!]
They might have put it on the ceiling.

1495
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,680
[They're searching every
nook and cranny.]

1496
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,780
Careful, careful!

1497
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,750
- There it is!
- Jackpot!

1498
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,320
They hid here?
It's almost impossible to find it.

1499
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,800
[It's a key with a green heart!]

1500
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,800
It's green!

1501
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,430
Let's go!

1502
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:56,970
[Don't hesitate!]
Let's just go to the room.

1503
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,640
The key is smaller then others.

1504
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,310
Ji Hyo wouldn't have lied to us.

1505
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,910
It's not a red key, right?

1506
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:07,920
It'll never be a red key.
Do you believe what Kwang Soo said?

1507
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,990
[It's open!]

1508
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,460
Thank you, Ji Hyo!

1509
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,320
- It's open!
- Ji Hyo!

1510
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,530
[Thanks to Ji Hyo, they get
to see the legendary rings.]

1511
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,070
Be careful, don't let
the bracelet rip.

1512
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:27,300
[But, I'm too excited!]

1513
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,040
Ji Hyo, we found it!

1514
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:36,240
Now, we need to get downstairs.

1515
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,380
- We need to hide it.
- Cover it.

1516
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:47,620
Was that a mirror?

1517
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:51,660
[What did you say?]
We don't have time for that!

1518
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,530
I wasn't sure if it was a teacher.

1519
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,030
[She's so different from
the character in the drama.]

1520
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,900
[They get on the elevator quickly.]

1521
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,540
Let's go to the P1.

1522
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:09,720
[We've heard that the
platform is on P1.]

1523
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,940
[It stopped on the third floor!]

1524
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:15,340
<i>The door is opening.</i>

1525
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,020
[Who could it be?]

1526
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,490
[Could it be Ha Ha?]

1527
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:21,010
[Or one of the teachers?]

1528
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,110
[Ta-da!]

1529
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,270
[Mr. Jung is here!]

1530
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,730
[He's proud of himself.]

1531
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,100
I've been waiting for you.

1532
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,360
Why is it so easy to catch you?

1533
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,200
[Use stairs, it's healthier.]

1534
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,600
I'm a big fan of you.

1535
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,740
I'm your fan, but I'm
your teacher today.

1536
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,970
If you keep avoiding...

1537
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,410
that's an infringement
of teachers right.

1538
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:47,540
Please... let us go.
I'll tell you where others are.

1539
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,610
No need.

1540
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,280
I found the celebrity like a treasure.

1541
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,780
Please give us
five more seconds.

1542
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,750
You're standing too
close to each other!

1543
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,920
I don't want to do this physically.

1544
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,190
I know, I know.

1545
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,760
Let's just go out.

1546
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,690
It's too cramped here.

1547
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay.

1548
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,630
- Do you want to run for a bit?
- Yes, just for a moment.

1549
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:07,700
I see.

1550
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,100
It's a children's game.
Red light, green light.

1551
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,500
I'll count to three.

1552
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,810
Red light, green light!
[run]

1553
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:18,140
[Run]
[Stop right there!]

1554
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,040
[Run for your life!]

1555
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,580
[Body check!]

1556
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,090
[She captures Grasshopper!]

1557
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,990
[While Miss Hwang hold him...]

1558
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,630
[Mr. Jung broke the couple up.]

1559
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:38,330
Are they ousted?

1560
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,630
Good job!

1561
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:42,590
[They were wrecked in three seconds.]

1562
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,560
[Jae Suk and Han Byul are ousted!]

1563
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,340
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
are running at full speed.]

1564
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,650
[That's the wrong way!]

1565
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,220
We can't get out of this floor.

1566
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,420
We're almost there.

1567
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:12,800
They've met.
They're running!

1568
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,900
Don't we need to go now?

1569
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,730
- Let's go!
- They got captured.

1570
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:21,270
[Mr. Jung is seeing
them to the elevator.]

1571
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,770
I almost captured Yoon Bak.
But they locked the door.

1572
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,980
- It's impossible to catch them.
- I've caught them.

1573
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,080
[The elevator opens.]

1574
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,590
[Kkuk and Stephanie
are inside the elevator.]

1575
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,260
[What a windfall!]
Mr. Jung!

1576
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:42,780
I told you earlier.

1577
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,340
[Kkuk appeared at a perfect moment.]

1578
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,230
- Wait, wait.
- What about them?

1579
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,930
We've already caught them.

1580
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:54,440
[They're keeping an
eye on the situation.]

1581
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,470
Are they walking around on P1?

1582
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,840
[Let's go when they're busy!]

1583
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,340
[They're still bickering.]
Kim Jong Kook!

1584
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,450
They were on the fourth floor.

1585
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,750
[What's going on?]

1586
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:10,280
[They're the students
who are running away.]

1587
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,720
[Victory is ours!]

1588
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,060
[I can't let it happen.]

1589
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:23,660
[Where is the platform?]

1590
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,800
It's not here.

1591
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:35,980
[If the platform is not on the P1,
they'll be like a rat in a trap.]

1592
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,120

1599
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:07,440

1600

Thank you.
[It's good that you won!]

1602
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:16,020
By the way, Hwang Suk Jung and
Jung Kyung Ho were really scary.

1603
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,850
- Yes, they were scary!
- Suk Jung, please show us how you ran.

1604
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,820
Look at her!

1606
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,660
She's so scary.
[Lucky, I didn't have to face her.]

1607
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:32,230
Seung Yeon, how was the race?

1608
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:36,970
I was worried about Running Man.
And it was scary.

1609
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,500
But, I even won the race.

1610
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,240
I'm so thankful.
It worked well.

1611

She kept shaking.

1615
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:53,520
Give us your thoughts.

1616
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,420
I had so much fun.

1617
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,620
I want to come back and win next time.

1618
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,560
I'm regretting.

1619
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,430
She's only warmed up now
that it's time to go.

1620
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,990
She was absent-minded before.

1621
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:05,400
Congratulations, again!
