1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,840
[The "Running Man"
mission box is delivered.]

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,350
What's this?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,880
[Lively girl, Park Bo Young]

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,840
"Please bring a nostalgic item."

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,990
"The older the item is,
the more beneficial."

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,260
"However, you need evidence or someone
to prove the time period."

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,610
Do we need to film the evidence?

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,040
[Bingo]

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,730
Oh goodness!

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,740
Aren't I at a disadvantage?
The older the item...

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,370
No matter how old the item is

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,740
I was only born in the '90s.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,180
This is a little troubling.

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,850
All my old items are back at home.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,690
I need to go home.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,720
[Who else got the mission box?]

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,030
[The classic wild card,
Lee Chun Hee.]

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,530
[What's this?]

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,390
[Blank]

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,740
What do I do?

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,480
[The weakling of villains,
Kim Hee Won.]

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,500
[What do you use this for?]

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,720
You want me to film
something with this?

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
I don't have any items...

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,430
[I can't just make up something...]

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,130
[All the Running Man members
got the mission boxes, too!]

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,330
We need to bring a nostalgic item.

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,500
I wish there was a
picture of Suk Jin and I...

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,610
[Think all the way back
with your special things!]

30
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,140
[What are their legacies?]

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,610
[The Legacy]

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,220
Today, there are three guests that
are sharing joyful memories with you.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,590
Who are they?

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh!

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,350
Who is it?

36
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,290
[Lee Chun Hee is here!]

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,130
It's still hot!

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,430
[Welcome!]

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,500
[Fashion point, leather jacket.]

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,330
Does every actor wear
clothes like this?

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,900
Kwang Soo, you look cool today!

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,410
- You're an actor!
- You've surpass the weather!

43
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,880
[The two fashion people are alike.]

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,880
- I see him so often.
- He's family.

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Of course.

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,790
You've gotten a lot older.

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,750
You aged, too!

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,250
You look older than
when I saw you in the countryside.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,990
How long ago was that?

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,100
It was seven years ago.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,610
[Just then, the variety show
blue chip has arrived!]

52
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,610
[Weakling Kim Hee Won.]

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,280
It's going to be fun today!

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,100
[Let's give you a lift!]

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,840
He's that light?

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,300
[Lift! Lift!]

57
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,970
[He's as light as a feather!]

58
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,550
[This is his reputation?]

59
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,770
[Our cute brother.]

60
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,480
You're so weak!

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,780
He's paper thin!

62
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,290
He's so weak!

63
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,880
[Out of energy]

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,130
He's the weakest.

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,100
Weakling!

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,790
"Don't come!"

67
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,350
<i>Go away!</i>

68
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,030
[Please don't come here!]

69
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,110
"Don't do that!"

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>Why are you only cheating me...</i>

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>It just means that we're close.</i>

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,150
<i>I only met you today.</i>

73
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,920
[His grudge hidden
behind his weak side.]

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,420
We need to have an arm wrestling match.

75
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,190
That would be fun!

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,490
[Whose voice is this?]

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,570
[Park Bo Young is here!]

78
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,370
[Automatic seal clap]

79
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,070
[Oh my Bo Young!]

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,180
[They're treating her differently...]

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,080
[Refreshing]

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,020
You filmed a movie
with Kwang Soo, right?

83
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,490
- Yes.
- She's the lead role.

84
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,630
I'm a supporting role.
He's the lead role.

85
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,290
The fish head is the lead role.

86
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,930
He's been saying this
since last week...

87
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,070
Today's theme is
"The Throwback Legacy Race."

88
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,370
[Legacy?]

89
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,340
You'll be going to locations in Seoul
that are interesting and unknown.

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,310
And you need to gather as many
throwback legacies as possible.

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,110
Before you do that, you received

92
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,620
a mission last night, right?

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,350
We asked you to
bring a personal item.

94
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,420
- It was so hard.
- Me, too.

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,470
[They're revealing the
ten different items.]

96
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,190
- What's with the suit?
- This is 20 years old.

97
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,490
- Really?
- Yes.

98
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,730
I got it as soon as
I became a comedian.

99
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,930
One of my senior
comedians told me

100
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,600
"Now that you've become a celebrity,
shouldn't you at least have a nice suit?"

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,250
And it's a brand-name product.

102
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,740
[What is Jae Suk's memory?]

103
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,010
Hello, I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

104
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,680
Running Man told us
to bring a nostalgic item.

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,620
My item is 20 years old.

106
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,390
After I became a comedian

107
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,300
I bought it with my mother's card.

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,900
Was it ten months or 12 months
interest-free that I got it for?

109
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,570
I paid a small amount per month
for a really long time.

110
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:47,040
This is the suit that I got.

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,150
I used to wear a lot, back in the day.

112
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,320
This is my nostalgic item.

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,020
I will bring

114
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,560
this item.

115
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,560
[A 24-year-old suit.]

116
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
[Three-button suits were
the trend in the '90s.]

117
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,070
Hello, this is Park Bo Young.

118
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm already at a disadvantage.

119
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,240
What do I do...

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,910
All the items that I've kept

121
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,660
are all back at home in Chungbuk.

122
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,880
And I don't have the
time to go back home.

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,890
So I'm at my newly moved-in house.

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,240
I still have unpacked boxes.

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,200
[Should I open my
memory-filled boxes?]

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,060
My fans have sent me those.

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,410
This is "A Werewolf Boy."

128
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,440
This is the film continuity book.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,930
This is how it is drawn.

130
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,550
That was "A Werewolf Boy."

131
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,440
This is

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,040
"Scandal Makers"

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,560
it was actually called
"Three generation scandals."

134
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,770
This is probably the oldest one...

135
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,410
My album?

136
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,930
I have it...

137
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,880
[Let's see!]

138
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,180
[Eureka!]

139
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,440
Ta-da!
Do you see what's written here?

140
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,210
It says 1991, March 31.

141
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,430
That's me.

142
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,590
That is me.

143
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,300
Hi, Mom.

144
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,040
The picture of me that was
taken on March 31, 1991...

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,530
The baby in your arms
getting baptized

146
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,090
- is me, right?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,480
- That's me, right?
- Yes.

148
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,830
- Thank you, Mother.
- Of course.

149
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,870
I just called my mom.
That is me.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,900
- An old photo?
- Are you getting baptized?

151
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,660
When she was baptized!

152
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,590
[One year old]

153
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,390
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.

154
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,840
I am back home

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,900
in Namyangju.

156
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,750
It's a traditional upper garment
I received from my Dad.

157
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,520
It's 2 in the morning

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,240
and because my Dad just got up

159
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,500
he will say a few words,
behind the camera.

160
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,230
Yes, so please explain this.

161
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,300
You wore that when you were born.

162
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,500
Your mom kept it...

163
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,410
The viewers are watching,
so please speak with honorifics.

164
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,370
Oops, sorry.

165
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,060
This is the first thing you wore
when your were born.

166
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,950
Please say Kwang Soo...

167
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,610
Oh, should I?

168
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,680
Are you Kwang Soo?

169
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,390
This is for the viewers.

170
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,750
Kwang Soo was

171
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,570
born on July 14, 1985

172
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,330
and this is the first clothing
he wore that day.

173
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,970
Mom kept it, well.

174
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,110
I want to thank my parents who
looked all over the house for this.

175
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,080
And I will bring this
precious item in this box.

176
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,990
Thank you!

177
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,190
[The traditional garment is 30 years old.]

178
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,990
[The first shirt Kwang Soo
wore as a baby.]

179
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,830
Next is Jong Kook!

180
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,190
- I brought...
- What's that?

181
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,610
- This is so old!

That was close!

359
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,100
The next category are jingles.

360
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,810
That's fine, you know a lot of songs.

361
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,700
Jae Suk's going up!

362
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,170
[Shall I go up this time?]

363
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,840
He has the most
knowledge on jingles!

364
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,970
He knows too many.

365
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,480
He knows way too many.

366
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,450
Let's go!

367
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,180
You need to sing
this jingle, correctly.

368
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,590
This isn't easy!

369
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,920
This is the first one.

370
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,460
What are the lyrics
to this commercial?

371
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,770
He hits the wall!

372
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,410
This ad was popular with
Lee Duk Hwa's acting

373
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,750
and was remade by Kwon Sang Woo
and Lee Hyo Ri 12 years later.

374
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,150
This is the question.

375
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,480
You have to sing the entire
jingle from beginning to end.

376
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,060
<i>Now, you came up to me
and call me.</i>

377
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,410
[He's doing well.]

378
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,700
<i>Stylish men, stylish women</i>

379
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,840
<i>Oh, "Torai"
(He changed it from "Try,")</i>

380
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,660
[Will he get the correct answer?]

381
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,260
[Yoo Jae Suk got it correct!]

382
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,400
[Sad vs. happy]

383
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,480
[They both earned ten years.]

384
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,850
This is nothing!

385
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,810
I know all the jingles.

386
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,020
[I'm the master of commercials.]

387
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,650
- Did you only watch TV?
- Yes.

388
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,620
All I did was watch TV.

389
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,120
I didn't you would
be this specific.

390
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,830
The next category is
picking the odd ad out.

391
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,230
Bo Young, you go!

392
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,950
It's alright!

393
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,300
I don't know any of them!

394
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,770
I've only heard of the
"I'm getting off here."

395
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,310
I only know that line

396
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,240
- "I'm getting off here."
- Really?

397
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,940
- I didn't know any of the other ones.
- Oh no, Bo Young...

398
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,780
This is the next question.

399
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,720
What was this
commercial advertising?

400
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,250
Oh no!

401
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,520
[What was this
commercial advertising?]

402
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,200
I've never seen this...

403
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,100
I'm getting confused.

404
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,300
I know this one!

405
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,340
What ad is this for?

406
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,610
This is all of it?

407
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,580
Bo Young, press it!

408
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,520
- I don't know...
- Just try!

409
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,790
Mouthwash?

410
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,060
Mouthwash.

411
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,400
[Now, it's Jae Suk's try!]

412
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,730
I was a little bit confused.

413
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,130
Isn't this for a mobile carrier?

414
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,200
A mobile carrier?

415
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,410
[Will his winning streak continue?]

416
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,050
[Oh no]

417
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,920
[Good job, Bo Young.]

418
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,890
It's okay Bo Young!

419
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,320
[Team Ji Hyo earned 20 years.]

420
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,660
[How did he know that?]

421
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,460
[The correct answer]

422
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,430
[Why did my phone have to ring, now?]

423
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,930
[Punch!]

424
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,900
[Korea's communication channel,
Digital 011.]

425
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,370
[This is pretty nostalgic...]

426
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,080
I can't believe that watching
TV all my life paid off!

427
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,880
- Wow!
- How is he so good?

428
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,120
[My mom told me not to,
but it's helping me so much now.]

429
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,990
[Lee Chun Hee vs. Lee Kwang Soo.]

430
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,260
I'm going to win!

431
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,990
This is another jingle.

432
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,060
I wish there was one before
Kwang Soo was born.

433
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
Is it "From the sky"?

434
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,770
It's that one!

435
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,270
You know this one, right?

436
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,240
[We will show the
viewers the answer, first.]

437
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,170
<i>Pick stars from the sky</i>

438
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:39,080

<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh.</i>

442

From the beginning to end.

443

[Is he trying to
serenade somebody?]

449

[You can't skip half of the song...]

457

[Innocent brain brothers!]

469
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,470
They're actually the old fool and young
fool on our SBS Sunday variety shows.

[Old fool and young fool.]

472

No I didn't!

474

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,420
I didn't think you would
actually cut my hair.

708
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,960
Don't worry, I won't cut a lot.
I'll make you handsome.

709
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,840
I'm only trimming a little.
No one can tell.

710
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,500
When it's done, will I look like you?

711
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,900
No, you're not going to
have the same hair style.

712
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,600
- I'll get a taste of what's to come...
- I know, I know.

713
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,840
I'll come next time.
I want to come with my dad.

714
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,900
[Interesting]

715
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,190
Is this all my hair?

716
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,380
[Piled up]

717
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,300
It's not much.

718
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,500
[I can't even call it a haircut.]

719
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,240
Don't worry.

720
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,950
I need to keep this hairstyle
for my work!

721
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,900
[Surprised]

722
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,700
[He doesn't stop cutting his hair.]

723
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,300
You're the first celebrity
I'm giving a haircut.

724
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,580
It's an honor!
I'm serious.

725
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,780
I don't usually cut celebrity's hair.
You're the first one.

726
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,650
[He's even going to wash his hair!]

727
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,350
This is the best part.

728
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,890
[What is that?]

729
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,120
What's this?

730
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,980
It's apple cider vinegar.

731
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,090
Pardon me?
Vinegar?

732
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,430
It's a natural hair conditioner.

733
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,180
[Mr. Artisan...]

734
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,570
[You don't have to do my hair...]

735
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,640
[He's getting a shaving service instead.]

736
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,280
[He looks like a mannequin.]

737
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,510
Don't make him laugh, Kwang Soo.

738
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,380
[Getting the haircut was way better.]

739
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,240
Oh, it hurts!

740
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,160
- Excuse me...
- It takes less than 30 seconds.

741
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,690
Now, you can wash your face.

742
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,290
Thank you for your hard work!

743
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,560
You look different, Chun Hee.

744
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,630
[Ta-da!]
You look nicer.

745
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,170
It feels like I'm born again.

746
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,040
Of course, I have a personal preference

747
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,610
but I guess this
hair style is more popular.

748
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,550
When I was young,
I've always wanted to shave like this

749
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,250
- when I saw my dad doing it.
- He told me that.

750
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,520
You need to go against each other.

751
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,760
[Finally, the battle begins!]

752
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,990
The winner will get

753
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,460
92 years' worth of

754
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,000
79 years' worth of

755
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,070
44 years' worth of hourglass.

756
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,670
44 years' worth?

757
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,670
[It's a good chance
to add hourglasses.]

758
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,340
79 years' worth?
That's a lot!

759
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,970
Wait a minute, 100 years...

760
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,610
I think Suk Jin went for
the 100 years' worth match.

761
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,950
Jae Suk went there!

762
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh no!

763
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,680
Suk Jin went to the place
that's 100 years old.

764
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,950
[At that moment, at the tailor...]

765
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,270
One, two!
[Ta-da!]

766
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,350
[They look like characters
from "Kington."]

767
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,980
They don't really suit us.

768
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,810
He's a master artisan

769
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,840
- but he didn't make these for us!
- Aren't these suits for someone else?

770
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,580
I can tell the owner of this suit
isn't that tall.

771
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,730
The pants should be little longer, right?

772
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,330
You're at the tailor shop
that's 100 years old.

773
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,390
Fedora, tie clip, and
cuff links, and shoes.

774
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,930
You're fully dressed up.

775
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,700
This is the first mission.

776
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,770
Starting now, take off
everything you're wearing.

777
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,840
[Take off everything?]

778
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,910
- Take off everything you're wearing.
- Take off?

779
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,670
This is what you do.

780
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,240
Take off everything except the
white t-shirt and underpants.

781
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,350
- What about the hat?
- You need to take it off, too.

782
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,550
From now on, take off everything.
Ger ready...

783
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:40,610
[This match is 100 years' worth!]

784
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,470
[I must win!]

785
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,330
Start!

786
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,730
[In a hurry]

787
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,970
[Jae Suk doesn't hesitate
to take his clothes off.]

788
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,270
[A button stuck to the tie clip.]

789
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,770
I finally got it off.

790
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,380
[Jae Suk is about to take off his shirt.]

791
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,350
Calm down.
Don't be in a hurry.

792
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,520
[When Jae Suk takes the lead,
Big Nose start playing dirty.]

793
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,760
[Of course, they start a messy war.]

794
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,930
I need to take 100 years!

795
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,330
[Hop, hop]

796
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,950
[Grasshopper takes off everything
with his hopping skills.]

797
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,900
[He only needs to push the timer.]

798
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,170
[I can't let you go!]

799
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,540
What are you doing?
This might look really strange!

800
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,310
[A disgraceful scene]

801
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,990
[Jae Suk is done undressing.]

802
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:51,490
The first round's winner is Jae Suk.

803
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,330
My opponent isn't Jong Kook.
What a relief!

804
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,180
[He's already exhausted.]
For the second round

805
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,750
- wear everything you took off.
- I knew it!

806
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,920
They're all over the floor.

807
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,670
This is really tiring!

808
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,040
Same as before, you'll start
when I tell you to start.

809
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,410
Ready...

810
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:19,900
[Two consecutive victories?
Or will it even the score?]

811
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,250
[The second round begins.]
Begin!

812
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,420
[He kicked Suk Jin's pants!]

813
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,360
[A nude battle]

814
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,330
[A battle of the century
to gain a century!]

815
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,600
[Let's go all the way!]

816
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,000
[All of a sudden,
they fight out of ring.]

817
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,240
You'll have to walk out
without wearing pants.

818
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,440
[Jae Suk succeeds at wearing pants.]

819
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,180
[And he's wearing his shirt.]

820
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,920
[Come on, pants!]

821
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,820
[He takes the pants
and walks out the door.]

822
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,230
[Going to an office right in front.]

823
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,860
Excuse me, can I leave
this here for a moment?

824
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,030
Where are my clothes?

825
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,630
Where's my jacket?
[It's at the office with your pants.]

826
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,240
It's outside?

827
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
[This is my chance!]

828
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,510
[Big-nose is using the timer
as a shield but fails.]

829
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,280
[He got caught by the wire.]

830
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,190
[I'll be right back.]

831
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,660
- Are you heading to the bathroom?
- No.

832
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,060
[I'm getting my pants back]

833
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,740
Hello!
Excuse me.

834
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,710
I'm so sorry.

835
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,010
This is the wrong place!

836
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,120
[Jae Suk is almost done.]

837
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,920
I think I'm done.

838
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,690
Where did one of my cuff links go?

839
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,210
[He found it at the corner.]

840
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,900
[I can't lose it again.]

841
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,800
[The only thing left for Jae Suk
is the hat.]

842
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,310
[If that's the case...]
This drives me nuts.

843
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,740
[He steals his hat.]

844
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,510
[Big-nose succeeded at it
by a hair's breadth.]

845
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,620
Since Suk Jin pushed the timer first,
he's the winner for the second round.

846
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,970
[Current score 1:1]

847
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,390
Don't tell us to take it off again.

848
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,930
[It's so hard to win 100 years' worth.]

849
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,430
What are we suppose to do now?

850
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,970
From now on, you'll start the mission
to win the legacy from this shop.

851
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:59,070
Pile the rice cake you just
cut as high as possible.

852
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,480
[Pile them?]

853
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,410
Seriously...

854
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:10,380
I was wondering why they
wanted us to cut them.

855
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,490
- Why did I cut like a food?
- Get ready.

856
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,090
You need to put them down.

857
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,630
I'm so sorry.

858
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,500
Ready, set, go!

859
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
[It begins openly and squarely!]

860
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,040
[Both of them start with
placing big pieces at the bottom.]

861
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,240
If you're an architect
that's watching this show

862
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,610
please don't forget that the
foundation work is really important.

863
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,580
So, the building won't fall.

864
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,150
With good materials.

865
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,360
[It's not so easy.]

866
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,890
[Shake, shake]

867
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,860
Can you please stand up for me?

868
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm really desperate now.

869
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,500
Please help me for once!

870
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,940
I'm begging you.

871
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,410
[Ji Hyo's tower is getting taller.]

872
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,240
I'm in trouble!

873
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,710
Ji Hyo!

874
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,310
Ji Hyo!
[Roaring of a lion]

875
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,720
[A scary attack with sound wave]

876
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,160
Ji Hyo.
[Please let me win once.]

877
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,070
[As soon as Ji Hyo's tower
becomes higher than hers...]

878
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,260
- Ji Hyo!
- Don't do that!

879
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,170
[A spurt at the last minute]

880
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,970
Oh, no!
I can't tell who won!

881
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,840
[They look pretty similar.]
We'll measure it.

882
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,680
It's eight centimeters.

883
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:54,850
Could you please measure that side?
That side is slightly higher.

884
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,120
[Whose tower will be higher?]

885
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,220
It's eight and a half centimeters.

886
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,160
Park Bo Young wins!

887
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,330
[Team Bo Young acquires 44 years.]

888
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,270
[In the mean time]
I can do this very fast.

889
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,140
In the basket, there are
100 pairs of spoons and chopsticks.

890
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,680
You need to sort them out.

891
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,080
Long time ago, I learned how from Gary.

892
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,450
I taught him how to sort
and put them in paper wrappers.

893
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,220
I used to do that really fast.

894
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,490
I learned from cleaning these
and everything else from Gary.

895
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,660
But he raised a tiger.

896
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,800
[What are you talking about?]

897
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,670
[Teacher Gary vs. Pupil Ha Ha]

898
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,740
The one to finish first will win.
[A battle between a teacher and a pupil]

899
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,610
[Teacher Gary starts
sorting out in a flash.]

900
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,980
[Student Ha Ha doesn't give an inch.]

901
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,550
[Neck and neck]

902
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,860
I can't lose this time, Ha Ha!

903
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,430
I've learned from you,
but I got really good!

904
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,240
I still work at my restaurant.

905
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,630
[I'll show you my reserved strength!]

906
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,100
[Ha Ha's new standing strategy.]
I'm almost done!

907
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,910
Oh, no a chopstick went the wrong way!

908
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,810
[While Gary made a mistake]
Gary!

909
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,110
See what I can do?

910
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,150
This is frustrating.

911
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,620
- Ha Ha wins!
- Yeah!

912
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,590
You know I changed my business...

913
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,560
and that's why it happened.

914
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,020
Let's do something like
pouring sauces in a dish.

915
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,330
- That's my expertise!
- Is that?

916
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,770
[Team Bo Young acquires 79 years.]

917
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,340
[Kwang Soo and Chun Hee's mission is]

918
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,990
Move shaving cream with your face.

919
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,080
[How can I move it
with my face?]

920
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:16,020
[Without using hands,
move more shaving cream and win.]

921
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,590
[Chun Hee starts first.]

922
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,440
[What are they doing?]

923
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,370
Wow, he's actually
carrying it with his face.

924
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,280
[I want to move even 1 gram.]

925
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,880
I feel sorry for him.
I'm sorry, Chun Hee.

926
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,090
Chun Hee, you're working
so hard for the movie.

927
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,520
I'll do it harder!

928
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,630
Kwang Soo, I want to win!
[His mouth is full of cream.]

929
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,660
[He's doing his best while crying.]

930
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,100
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

931
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,500
- Don't eat it!
- I'm hungry.

932
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:11,940
[He's doing his best until the end.]

933
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,080
You can stop now.

934
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,750
You have a lot of cream
in your nose.

935
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,350
[Chun Hee's record is 26.5 grams.]

936
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:29,220
We're doing so much stuff
even more than a beauty show.

937
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,460
Haircut, styling

938
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,930
skin care, shave

939
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,400
facial wash with shaving cream!

940
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,270
It's like you're getting a whitening care.

941
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,240
[It's Kwang Soo's turn.]

942
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,410
Ready, set, go!

943
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,420
[I'm going to win,
no matter what!]

944
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,260
[I'm satisfying myself for the team!]

945
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,760
[He's amazing!]

946
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,970
This is Running Man, Master Artisan!

947
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,640
Thank you, Master Artisan!

948
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,370
The haircut

949
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:23,510
[and he gets a shaving
cream facial massage.]

950
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,950
Kwang Soo, that's enough.
You win.

951
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,250
I want more shaving cream!

952
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,450
[Time is up!]

953
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,060
[Spooky]

954
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,000
Are you okay, Kwang Soo?

955
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,030
[Kwang Soo's record is 75.2 grams.]

956
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,640
You moved three times more than him.

957
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,940
[I won, but I'm not that excited...]

958
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,610
- You've worked so hard!
- Chun Hee!

959
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,450
[We thought you'd use your chin...]

960
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,550
[Team Bo Young acquired 89 years.]

961
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,620
Since, each of you won once.
We'll start the third round.

962
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,820
Connect hangers
and keep them balanced.

963
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,130
You'll lose if the balance breaks.

964
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,670
[Rue: Take turns connecting hangers.
You'll lose if the hanger gets tilted.]

965
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,040
Until when should we continue?

966
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:31,940
If it reaches to the floor,
you can start a new one on the side.

967
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,110
[They'll lose if it loses
its balance for a second.]

968
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,910
This looks unstable.

969
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,390
[Jae Suk succeeded.]

970
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,330
[Suk Jin's turn]

971
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,350
It's an interesting game.

972
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,970
[Big-nose succeeded, as well.]

973
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,270
Start a new one...

974
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,870
[At that moment]

975
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,980
[Big-nose's hanger loses its balance]

976
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,180
I won!
[Team Ji Hyo, Jae Suk wins.]

977
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,450
[I can't believe this!]

978
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,610
That was so close!

979
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,890
I could have won this game!
[Team Ji Hyo acquires 100 years.]

980
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,200
The mission at the
Oriental Medical Clinic is

981
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,530
"Here is your herbal tonic."

982
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,630
Squeeze the boiled herbs
to get tonic.

983
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,700
The one who gets more liquid will win.

984
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,210
You know when you squeeze your laundry...

985
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:42,850
I lost against Suk Jin at arm wrestling
because I kept squeezing my towel.

986
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,240
[I will not lose today!]

987
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,950
[The mission begins!]

988
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,490
[Squeeze]

989
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,660
[I'm not the same old weak Kim Hee Won!]

990
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:03,180
[Unfortunately, his opponent
is Monster Kim Jong Kook.]

991
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,570
[Body vs. Mind]
[Their close match!]

992
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,280
[Victory is mine!]

993
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,380
[I will prove that I'm not a weak man...]

994
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,950
It's so hot!

995
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,320
[Even one more drop is fine!]

996
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,100
[With bare hand?]

997
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,730
That's a foul play!

998
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,970
Now stop!

999
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:48,140
[What will be the result?]
It's really hard to squeeze this.

1000
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,650
- I think I won.
- No, mine is higher.

1001
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,450
I'll put it on the scale.

1002
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,650
Please move your hands away.

1003
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:06,530
I have more, right?
It's 245 grams!

1004
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,160
[Jong Kook won by three grams.]

1005
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,370
I didn't think there would be
such a small difference.

1006
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,740
[It's a reversal that he did
as good as Mr. Capable.]

1007
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,510
[Team Bo Young acquires 92 years.]

1008
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:29,610
[The winner gets a special
legacy from each place.]

1009
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,050
[Team Bo Young acquires 304 years!]

1010
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,350
[On the contrary, Team Ji Hyo
acquires 100 years.]

1011
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,690
<i>This is a rice cake
from a 44-year-old...</i>

1012
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,390
[Jae Suk acquires an old invoice
that was issued in 1940.]

1013
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,040
<i>This rice cake looks so delicious!</i>

1014
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,630
[Jong Kook acquires a scale for
medicinal herbs that's 92 years old.]

1015
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:55,970
[Kwang Soo gets manual hair clippers
that's been used for 56 years.]

1016
00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:00,640
[Ha Ha gets a contract note
when they moved the restaurant in 1959.]

1017
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:07,090
[Bo Young gets bar rice cake
that was made with their secret recipe.]

1018
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,130
[At that moment]

1019
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,380
[the members receive a message
about the final site.]

1020
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,160
It's the final site!

1021
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,060
National Folk Museum of Korea.

1022
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,970
1-1 Sejong-ro, Jongno-gu.
[New - 37 Samcheong-ro, Jongno-gu]

1023
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,900
[What mission is waiting for them?]

1024
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,870
[National Folk Museum of Korea]

1025
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,540
I'll tell you about the final mission.

1026
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:36,350
"Capture the nostalgic legacy,"
and there are two ways to win.

1027
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:41,380
One way is that you collect all the
nostalgic items your opponents brought.

1028
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,210
Then you can put them in
your team's store window.

1029
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,470
Let's find them all
and end the mission.

1030
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:52,610
We need to find as much as possible.

1031
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:55,400
I think there should be one in here.

1032
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,200
- Gary, did you find any?
- I'm still searching.

1033
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,980
[Team Ji Hyo is doing their
best to find the item.]

1034
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,980
[The sound of a bell is approaching.]

1035
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,110
I need to hide first.

1036
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,350
<i>There are two ways to win.</i>

1037
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:12,650
<i>The other method is by eliminating
all the opponents' name tags.</i>

1038
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,080
<i>Isn't this too obvious?</i>

1039
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,040
<i>- What kind of rule is that?
- You're telling us to give up.</i>

1040
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,410
<i>The attacking team will wear bells
and oust the opponents.</i>

1041
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,440
<i>Each round is 20 minutes.</i>

1042
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,600
<i>And you'll take turns attacking
for each round.</i>

1043
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,870
- Searching is a better plan, right?
- We can't even eliminate them.

1044
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,270
[Team Ji Hyo is on defense first.]

1045
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,840
There's nowhere we can hide.

1046
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,570
- Look, there's no space!
- Let's get out of here.

1047
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,870
[Whistle]
Let's go!

1048
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,080
- You want to check the outside?
- They're scattered.

1049
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,950
I think I'll check the outside.
See you!

1050
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,980
- Enjoy!
- Good luck!

1051
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,610
There's no space for them to run away.

1052
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,630
Let's eliminate at least one.
[Team Bo Young is relaxed.]

1053
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,980
[Whistle]
That's the sound of whistle, right?

1054
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,300
What do I do?
What do I do?

1055
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,780
[The real race starts.]

1056
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,580
What's with the whistle?

1057
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,150
Attacking team is on their way.

1058
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,010
We're the attacking team?

1059
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,880
No, the attacking team
is coming to get us.

1060
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,580
[Big-nose starts attacking slowly.]

1061
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,950
It'll be really frustrating
when they hear the bell.

1062
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,670
Hey, I know you're frustrated.

1063
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,690
- Bo Young, scream if you see anyone.
- Yes, Kwang Soo.

1064
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,500
They're probably
searching for the items.

1065
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,270
[Grasshopper and Gary
are quietly searching.]

1066
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:45,740
Kwang Soo!
[I found them!]

1067
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,640
- Kwang Soo!
- What is it?

1068
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,210
- How do we get there?
- Where?

1069
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:57,250
[Bo Young saw Gary and Jae Suk
through the glass wall.]

1070
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,840
They saw us!
[Run!]

1071
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,790
Don't go that way!

1072
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,960
[Gary hides in the corner.]

1073
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,430
Come near me!
[He's carefully hiding his VJ.]

1074
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,760
[Kwang Soo passes Gary.]

1075
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,900
[Bo Young passes, too.]

1076
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,600
Are you sure?

1077
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,510
[Bo Young is about to
search the auditorium.]

1078
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:26,640
[Blank Ji and Chun Hee
are inside the dress room.]

1079
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,680
Gary!
[Surprised]

1080
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,720
[Her sweet and scary voice]
Gary!

1081
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,530
[She's rushing to the dress room.]
Gary!

1082
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,830
[We've got caught!]

1083
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,640
[They run out through the door
on the other side.]

1084
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,700
Kwang Soo!

1085
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,350
[What a loud voice
from a tiny figure!]

1086
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,170
I'm going to catch them!

1087
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,780
[Running at full speed]

1088
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,640
It's Chun Hee!

1089
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,410
[Mr. Capable was waiting
in front of the auditorium.]

1090
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,840
- We need to catch him!
- Where did he go?

1091
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,050
Wow, that was close!

1092
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,460
[I'm going to catch them!]

1093
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,430
[Time left until the shift]

1094
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,900
[Elder Kim Hee Won
is searching for the items in the dark.]

1095
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,710
[No nostalgic item will be here...]

1096
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,330
This is it!

1097
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:38,530
It's Suk Jin's item!
[It's Hyun Woo's golden hands.]

1098
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:43,720
[He still needs to put it
in their store window.]

1099
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,790
[Someone came.]

1100
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,160
Where should I put it?
Should I put it in here?

1101
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,430
This is safety zone.
[They can't enter the safety zone.]

1102
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:59,300
Don't you need to put it over there?

1103
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,570
[Yellow is Team Bo young's color.]

1104
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:04,400
Bring it on!

1105
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,770
Why would you want to
put your item there?

1106
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,710
[Such a poor guy]
Come at me!

1107
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,930
I can throw it, then.
[He's ready to block.]

1108
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:15,210
[Bo Young came out to attack.]

1109
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:19,150
- I'm not supposed to put it here?
- No, you should put it in your store.

1110
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,790
He might start running all of a sudden.

1111
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:24,210
Be careful, don't look anywhere else.
Just focus on Hee Won.

1112
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,530
[Yoo Jae Suk appears at the moment.]

1113
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,730
Jae Suk, catch this!
[He faked it.]

1114
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,670
[He loses Ha Ha and Bo Young easily.]

1115
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,210
This is upsetting!

1116
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,470
I put one item here!

1117
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,940
Jae Suk!

1118
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,710
Let's take a break.
[Jae Suk enters the safety zone.]

1119
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,250
It's so frustrating!

1120
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,250
After 20 minutes, we'll be on offense.

1121
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,520
This is the safety zone.

1122
01:02:55,390 --> 01:03:00,030
We can attack them after 20 minutes.
[Is he planning to stay here?]

1123
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,130
I was just touching it.

1124
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,530
[He might be the weakest,
but he's an expert teaser.]

1125
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,840
[Ha Ha is under Hee Won's control.]

1126
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:14,840
[Time left until the shift]
[Gary was hiding.]

1127
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,440
[She must be gone by now.]

1128
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,970
Are they gone?
[He's going back to search.]

1129
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,770
We need to oust at least one of them.

1130
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,320
He's coming this way.
Hide again!

1131
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,210
[He's hiding from Mr. Capable.]

1132
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,860
[He hides behind the garbage bins.]

1133
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,100
[He's not going to come all the way here.]

1134
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,430
Kwang Soo!

1135
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:49,340
[Mr. Capable is looking for Kwang Soo,
but he's getting close to Gary.]

1136
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,440
[You better hide.]

1137
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,750
Is this area included, too?
[The scary sound is approaching.]

1138
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,790
[He's not going to check
the garbage, is he?]

1139
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:06,390
[He is!]

1140
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,160
[It's suspicious...]

1141
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,090
[I found you!]

1142
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,300
[I caught you, Kang Gary!]

1143
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:19,100
I just thought it's a good spot to hide,
and Gary is hiding here.

1144
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,170
I'm sorry, Gary!

1145
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,440
<i>Gary is ousted,
Gary is ousted!</i>

1146
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,380
[I didn't think I would get
caught behind the garbage bin!]

1147
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,920
<i>Gary is ousted,
Gary is ousted!</i>

1148
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,190
[Team Ji Hyo found out
by the announcement.]

1149
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,590
Our team member is ousted...

1150
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,400
They'll be start attacking us,
when we have to shift roles.

1151
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,860
- This is really tiring.
- We need to start hiding.

1152
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,330
Bo Young, take a break first.

1153
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,070
- We'll get going.
- Good idea.

1154
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,570
We'll be in trouble,
if our time's up here.

1155
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,700
I think Jong Kook...
[Whistle]

1156
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,150
[Temporary pause]
[It's time to shift roles!]

1157
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,170
- Temporary pause!
- We're in trouble.

1158
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,820
[Mr. Capable stands still.]

1159
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,850
Oh, it's our turn to attack!

1160
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,760
[Switch offense an defense!]

1161
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,860
[Offense-Team Bo Young]
[Defense-Team Ji Hyo]

1162
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,390
[Offense-Team Ji Hyo]
[Defense-Team Bo Young]

1163
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,560
We're in big trouble.

1164
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,830
Let's eliminate one
that's near here.

1165
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,550
We'll attack Ha Ha first.

1166
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,530
Or Suk Jin, one of them.

1167
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:34,210
[Team Bo Young has to
search for the nostalgic items.]

1168
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,410
- Bo Young.
- Yes, Suk Jin?

1169
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:39,790
[By the way, where did Kwang Soo go?]

1170
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,750
Please come out, Kwang Soo.

1171
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,460
[Kwang Soo is pretending
that he's one of the staff.]

1172
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,440
How can you reveal my plan?

1173
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,530
It'll be okay
if we stay together.

1174
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,130
Wait for me, Ha Ha!

1175
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,480
[Even Chun Hee has fierce eyes now.]

1176
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,950
10 seconds before it resumes!

1177
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,500
Bo Young, you need to open the door.

1178
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,590
Even if they go inside,
we can still catch them.

1179
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,910
[There's no permanent
fugitives or chasers!]

1180
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,460
Two!

1181
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,510
[The shifting roles race, starts!]

1182
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:19,850
[Team Bo Young is running
away in outrageous speed!]

1183
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,970
- This won't do!
- Come over here!

1184
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:26,480
[It's their turn, but they're walking?]

1185
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,060
[They seemed like
they would catch Ha Ha.]

1186
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,800
[We have a plan.]

1187
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:38,060
[Chun Hee, start the operation!]

1188
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,640
- Hurry up, Chun Hee!
- Kim Jong Kook!

1189
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:46,460
[Jong Kook is running away,
Chun Hee is chasing him!]

1190
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,370
[And Kwang Soo is passing by!]

1191
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:55,490
[Team Ji Hyo's only target Mr. Capable!]

1192
01:06:55,490 --> 01:07:00,690
[Jong Kook, I won't let you escape!]

1193
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,080
[While Chun Hee is holding Jong Kook]

1194
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,200
[Hee Won joins them.]
Hee Won, hurry!

1195
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,900
He's off the wall now.

1196
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,040
- Eliminate his name tag!
- I can't!

1197
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,840
[Mr. Capable is not letting them
rip his name tag.]

1198
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,680
[Will they be able to win
against Mr. Capable?]

1199
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,390
[At that moment!]
I caught his name tag!

1200
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,590
[Hee Won grabs Jong Kook's name tag.]

1201
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:39,570
[Will he be able to eliminate
Mr. Capable's name tag?]

1202
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:43,410
[He did it!]

1203
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:48,940
[The weakling ousted Mr. Capable!]

1204
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,100
We caught the big fish!

1205
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,880
<i>Kim Jong Kook is ousted,
Kim Jong Kook is ousted!</i>

1206
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,570
[Team Ji Hyo vs. Team Bo Young]
[4:4]

1207
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:05,060
What's going on?

1208
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:08,060
<i>Kim Jong Kook is ousted,
Kim Jong Kook is ousted!</i>

1209
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:12,130
Kim Jong Kook is ousted?
Kim Jong Kook is ousted?

1210
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:17,000
[Oh my god, Kukk is ousted!]

1211
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,130
[They lost Kim Jong Kook
during their first defense...]

1212
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,900
Oh, no!
He has only one name tag!

1213
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,710
[He has only one name tag!]

1214
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:26,970

<i>Each extra name tag lets you come
back to life in the next round</i>

1218
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,750

1219
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,960

[It's favorable for us!]</i>

for Kim Jong Kook...</i>

1226
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,700

- Who has extra name tags?
- I'm not sure.

- I can't do that.
- You won over me at arm wrestling.

We're having a crisis.

1292
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,910
We have a disadvantage.

spirit is higher than ever.]

1379
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,410
[Only Kkuk without a name tag
stays alone in the jail.]

1380
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,420
[Jae Suk runs like the wind.]

1381
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,820
[He adds the Walkman
to the store window.]

1382
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:54,990
[Jingle-jangle]

1383
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:57,790
Listen, it's not the time
to walk like that!

1384
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,430
- Jong Kook.
- Bo Young...

1385
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,400
Oh, it was Bo Young....

1386
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,670
It's you, Bo Young.

1387
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,270
Did you say I'm walking?

1388
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,640
That's too harsh.

1389
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,840
Did you find anyone?

1390
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,040
They're all inside the safety zone.

1391
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:19,380
I think we need to do the same.

1392
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,850
I couldn't find Ji Hyo though.

1393
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,390
Bo Young doesn't really
say stuff like that.

1394
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:29,760
She must have hated
the other team so bad.

1395
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,360
Ji Hyo is right there.

1396
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,400
- Where?
- Oh, it's not her!

1397
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,660
[Team Bo Young is looking for
a chance to eliminate them.]

1398
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,210
I start seeing things now.

1399
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:42,030
Ha Ha!

1400
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:44,240
You're not going to search for the items?

1401
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
No.

1402
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,170
[Their goal is to oust all of us...]

1403
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:48,680
[Wait a minute!]

1404
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,550
[Let me see...]

1405
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:52,950
[There's Ha Ha]

1406
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:54,860
[Big-nose]

1407
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:58,750
[Bo Young and Kwang Soo.

1408
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:03,260
[Only one person is missing!]

1409
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,410
They don't have Jong Kook!

1410
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,490
[He figured it out!]

1411
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,590
[Which means...]

1412
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:14,530
They don't have Jong Kook!

1413
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:19,100
As I expected, the four except
Jong Kook revived!

1414
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,930
[He's figured out their situation.]

1415
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:25,060
We can attack them when it's our turn!

1416
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,500
Bring it on!

1417
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,010
[They made good use
of the safety zone.]

1418
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,100
Kim Jong Kook is ousted!

1419
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,840
No wonder!
Only four little fish were walking...

1420
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,990
What?
Little fish?

1421
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:41,610
Little fish?

1422
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,160
He's not here!

1423
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,190
Catch me if you can!

1424
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:50,260
[The angry meter is going up.]

1425
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,080
[I can't take it any longer!]

1426
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,240
[He tries to eliminate
his name tag but fails.]

1427
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,280
[Scream]

1428
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,590
[I'm having so much fun!]

1429
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,350
Ha Ha's going to go crazy, today.

1430
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,730
Just wait 10 minutes!

1431
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:11,640
- Think about how you've defeated today.
- Hooray!

1432
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:14,820
[In the mean time, Chun Hee...]

1433
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,660
[is wondering here and there.]

1434
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:24,210
[The rest of them
are following the plan.]

1435
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,970
Someone took the Walkman.

1436
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:28,480
[Chun Hee doesn't know
Jae Suk already took it.]

1437
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,530
[All of a sudden, he hides
himself on the floor.]

1438
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:35,040
[Jingle-jangle]

1439
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,950
[Does he think he's hiding?]

1440
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,780
[What a windfall!]

1441
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,280
No, no!

1442
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:51,010
[Chun Hee is protecting
his name tag desperately.]

1443
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:53,900
Please let me go.

1444
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,240
What are you talking about?
Our team is all dead.

1445
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,700
My bum is stuck!

1446
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,970
What?

1447
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:03,790
[Can you even come out?]
I don't think you can come out.

1448
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,860
- My arm is stuck.
- Are you serious?

1449
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,010
You should call the ambulance.

1450
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:16,060
- I'll get you out.
- You're going to break my arm.

1451
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:19,060
Try taking the hoodie off!

1452
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:22,040
He's lying.

1453
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,500
He's lying.
Take his arm out!

1454
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,630
Who is it?
Who's this person?

1455
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:31,300
[Three of them eliminated
his name tag together.]

1456
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,370
We did it.
Let's go!

1457
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:36,060
Next!

1458
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,440
[Both parties are stubborn!]

1459
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,480
They never over looked at me.

1460
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:47,150
<i>Lee Chun Hee is ousted.
Lee Chun Hee is ousted.</i>

1461
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,970
[He's left with a sweaty face.]

1462
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:57,660
[Big-nosed Brother runs away.]

1463
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:01,960
[Blank Ji is chasing closely.]

1464
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,860
Ji Hyo, stop it!

1465
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,830
Suk Jin, I'm sorry.

1466
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,810
You know I don't have a choice.

1467
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,060
[Ji Suk Jin is ousted.]

1468
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,100
<i>Ji Suk Jin is ousted.
Ji Suk Jin is ousted.</i>

1469
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,660
[I need to take a rest.]

1470
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:24,650
Bo Young!

1471
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:29,150
Ji Hyo!
[He was just checking his old spot.]

1472
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:32,280
- It was a perfect spot.
- I got caught here.

1473
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,430
You were hiding here?

1474
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:36,240
Ji Hyo!

1475
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:40,200
Don't shout, Gary.

1476
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,180
It's not fair!

1477
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:45,260
- Who's that?
- Come over here!

1478
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,240
[Here comes Yoo Jae Suk.]

1479
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,060
Isn't this unfair?

1480
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,570
Two men want to attack me?

1481
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,300
- I'm sorry.
- This is too harsh!

1482
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,860
I'm sorry, Bo Young.

1483
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,840
- I'm sorry, Bo Young.
- See you later.

1484
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,890
[They've successfully eliminated
Park Bo Young's name tag.]

1485
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,610
That's so petty!

1486
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,600
<i>Park Bo Young is ousted.</i>

1487
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,540
[Whistle]

1488
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:24,870
[Ji Hyo and Giraffe are fighting again.]

1489
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,850
[Attacking Giraffe!]

1490
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,150
Ji Hyo, hang in there.

1491
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,150
Hang in there, Ji Hyo!

1492
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,950
[He's on defense,
why is he so brave?]

1493
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,840
[Kim Hee Won has stepped
out of the safety zone!]

1494
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:51,150
[But he's talking nonsense
if the situations gets bad.]

1495
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:55,530
I'm sorry.

1496
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,570
[While Hee Won and Ha Ha are fighting]

1497
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:00,590
[Ji Hyo and Giraffe are still fighting.]

1498
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:03,880
[Did you just bite me?
I'll bite you, too!]

1499
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,610
[An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth!]

1500
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:11,120
[They're having a fist fight
and Jae Suk joined them.]

1501
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,880
[It's like we're watching
a pro-wrestling match.]

1502
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,590
If Kwang Soo eliminated Ji Hyo,
we'll be in trouble.

1503
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,630
Let me save her first.

1504
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:26,410
[Hee Won goes to help Ji Hyo.]

1505
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:31,570
[Oh, no!
His name tag is in danger!]

1506
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:36,130
[No way, he's not going to...]

1507
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:39,010
[He's eliminated!]

1508
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:43,320
[Gary came to help her.]

1509
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,840
[He couldn't even stand up.]

1510
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,620
<i>Kim Hee Won is ousted.</i>

1511
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,950
[Did Kwang Soo eliminated Monday Couple?]

1512
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:01,660
[He successfully eliminated
Song Ji Hyo's name tag.]

1513
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,880
[He attacks Jae Suk right away.]

1514
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,700
Ji Hyo!
[Ji Hyo and Gary vs. Kwang Soo and Ha Ha]

1515
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:15,920
[What a mad house!]

1516
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,240
Ji Hyo, what happened to you?

1517
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,930
Ji Hyo...

1518
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,550
What happened?

1519
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:28,930
- She must have fought outside.
- Did you roll on the grass?

1520
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,040
I had a fist fight with Kwang Soo.

1521
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,660
[Incredible]

1522
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,990
You've lived too long!

1523
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:39,550
I'm satisfied because I eliminated you.

1524
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,010
[They're still having a war.]

1525
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:45,590
I'm holding Jae Suk's name tag!

1526
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,410
Wait a minute, I'm going at it!

1527
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,250
I'm busy, too!

1528
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:53,280
If we can't eliminate him this time,
there won't be next.

1529
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,050
We've turned the table so quickly.

1530
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:58,150
I'm exhausted.

1531
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,830
- I missed it.
- I'm on the ground, too.

1532
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,440
Wait!

1533
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,330
[He's going at Jae Suk's name tag.]

1534
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:12,300
- No, Jae Suk!
- That was close!

1535
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,150
[The time goes by while
they're holding each other.]

1536
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,880
At this rate...

1537
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:27,680
We need to eliminate them now!

1538
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,860
[Team Bo Young tries to oust them.]

1539
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,860
[Whistle]

1540
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,900
Stay where you are.

1541
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,190
[Total wreck]

1542
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:53,510
What's wrong with you?

1543
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:59,180
Humans change their mind so quickly.

1544
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,350
What should we do?

1545
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,170
- Would you accept our apology?
- No, I won't.

1546
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:07,290
I'm so sorry.

1547
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,190
[10 seconds before the pause ends.]

1548
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:18,300
[Finally...]

1549
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:23,410
[the winner of this race
will be concluded!]

1550
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,680
