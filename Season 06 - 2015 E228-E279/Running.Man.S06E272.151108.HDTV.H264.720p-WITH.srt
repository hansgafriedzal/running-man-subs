[They came with a phone call.]

144
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,790
For some people, I think
we've done some harm...

145
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,920
You've invited Sung Mi...

146
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,690
Everyone's too scared
to cast her even for comedy!

147
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,860
Why did you call her?

148
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,880
I love Ha Ha because my son
looks a lot like him.

149
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,340
My son is this tall.

150
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,740
- Why did you come here?
- Who knew it was this bad?

151
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,310
I don't see very many elders here,
except for Chang Jung Koo.

younger than Jung Koo?

I'm older by four years.

157
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,890
[So is he the same age as Sung Mi?]

158
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,890
Were you born in 1959?

159
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,000
I was born in 1959,
but I entered school early.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,980
Don't do stuff like that.

161
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,000
[The year of the pig.]

162
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,210
[She cleared it up, in a flash.]

163
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,440
Even though they're elders,
there's still genealogy.

164
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,710
Genealogy is indefinite.

165
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,710
[Sorry]

166
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,520

[Comedian, Jae Suk's guest.]

169

I always call her in times of need.

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,760
You weren't doing anything, right?

171
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
I was doing the laundry.

172
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,200
I haven't done my laundry in a month.

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,260
It should be done...

174
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,500
But there's no one to dry them.

175
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Right when you need to switch them,
we'll let you go.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,270
Don't worry.

177
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,070
Sook was talking about
the guests here.

178
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,210
I wore this today...

179
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,610
[I want to find my best friend.]

180
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,810
You're on the wrong show.

181
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,680
[Sympathy]

182
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,250
- Can't you hook me up?
- No.

183
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,880
[She came to the wrong place.]

184
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,120
[There's another one
who feels the same.]

185
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
Wang Bae!

186
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,160
You keep talking to UEE...

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
[Embarrassed]

188
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,930
You haven't even spoken to us!

189
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,770
He's even slanted towards her!

190
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,240
They exchanged phone numbers.

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,740
She said she would visit my house.

192
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,810
I asked and she said
she would visit.

193
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,910
I like meat, too!

194
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,850
You talk about meat,
while everyone else talks about shrimp.

195
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,820
[You like meat?
I like shrimp.]

196
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,420
[I just opened
a shrimp restaurant.]

197
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,690
[DJ Pumkin, Choi Kyung Ho, Young Jun.]

198
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,990
- Please do your best today.
- Yes, of course.

199
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,590
And I also called Na Rae.

200
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,360
[Park Na Rae, comedian.]

201
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,030
Your outfit is very fancy, today.

202
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,060
I came right after
my other schedule.

203
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,000
And I didn't know it was
this kind of atmosphere.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,100
I bought some pants on the way.

205
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,270
I can't run with a skirt.

206
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,510
Look at her, she's so prepared.

207
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,010
You could have bought
long ones, why shorts?

208
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,080
They're too long for me.

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,280
[You need to check.]

210
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,190
Now that you're here,
could you show us your dance?

211
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,150
- It's a little hard with a skirt on.
- Just a snippet.

212
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,360
- Really?
- Yes.

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Please show us "krumping."

214
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,930
I'll just put these on...

215
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,660
Why are you changing here?

216
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,430
[She's changing here?]

217
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,870
[She overpowers 60 people.]

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,070
What's going on?

219
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,640
[What's going on?]

220
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,940
There are people standing in the back...

221
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,210
[There's lots to see.]

222
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,150
You can just look,
but why are you doing this?

223
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,020
[They're stretching their necks out.]

224
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
We can't see.

225
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,690
[I'm so curious.]

226
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,760
[She's dancing to the
beat of the Hong Dae.]

227
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,930
[Dance, dance]

228
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,370
[Bounce, bounce]

229
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,270
[There's energy from
such a small body.]

230
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,340
[The old man is enjoying it.]

231
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,310
[Speed up]

232
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,110
[The God of Dance appeared.]

233
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,580
[Regardless of preference,
it's absorbing.]

234
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,320
[They can't take their eyes off
even for a moment.]

235
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,190
[I am the hottest, Park Na Rae.]

236
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,820
[Two thumbs up!]

237
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,360
That's precious!

238
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,500
[The old men are happy, too.]

239
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
She just bought her shorts

240
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,530
from the market.

241
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,830
She did her best.

242
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,700
That was great.

243
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,010
And next is Seung Yoon.
Whose invite did you receive?

244
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,840
I called him.

245
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,940
- How do you know each other?
- We take Chinese classes together.

246
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,510
[Byun Seung Yoon, comedian.]

247
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,050
- He can speak a little...
- Can anyone speak Chinese?

248
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,080
How about they
try talking together?

249
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,590
We have Jackson!

250
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,620
(He's faking it.)

251
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,460
If you can't do it,
don't force yourself.

252
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,260
[He's pretending to be Chinese
in front of a Chinese person?]

253
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,230
[A Chinese gag in front
of a native speaker.]

254
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,830
[It sounded legit to us...]

255
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,740
Jackson might be
a little flustered.

256
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,100
Jackson, you go first.

257
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,640
[Real chinese]

258
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,180
[Fake Chinese]

259
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,050
[Why does it sound real?]

260
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,380
[He's better.]

261
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,720
They're saying that he sounds
more real than Jackson!

262
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
He's better than him!

263
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,030
[Which is really Chinese?]

264
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,530
- Do it once more!
- Just one more time!

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
[What is this.]

266
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
He's just copying me!

267
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,970
[His Chinese sounds so real.]

268
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,940
Good job!

269
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,080
[Seung Yoon gave a big laugh
with his gibberish.]

270
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,850
- You're so good!
- That was funny.

271
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,720
[Sorry for joking around.]

272
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,790
[It was funny!]

273
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,120
Who were you invited by?

274
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,460
I'm Zizo, a rapper invited by Ha Ha.

275
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,830
[I've never seen a rapper.]

276
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,770
His freestyle is awesome.

277
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,170
Yo, let's go.

278
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,040
One, two, yo yo.

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>When I was told to rap,
my worries began.</i>

280
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,210
<i>But I'm always ready to
run on Running Man.</i>

281
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,780
<i>Seoul is represented by SBS.</i>

282
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,450
<i>I can find my way, like a GPS.</i>

283
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,950
<i>This is just like a
rap heaven, you see.</i>

284
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,550
<i>I will show you
everything, all of me.</i>

285
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,860
<i>Just fried it, fried chicken.</i>

286
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,460
<i>That's how I'll
walk straight, driven.</i>

287
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,490
[His top-tier rap
was made up on the spot.]

288
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,660
[Bravo!]

289
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,230
[Swag!]

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Show me the money!

291
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,270
Can you do Hong Kong rap?

292
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,370
[Of course!]

293
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,210
[Rap?]

294
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,640
You can do Chinese rap?

295
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,780
[I lost...]

296
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,150
[He's receiving the energy
through his fingertips.]

297
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,650
[He's energizing his emotion.]

298
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,790
[A language, never before heard.]

299
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,790
[A brand new world of rap.]

300
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,870
Huh?

301
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,940
[His performance was perfect!]

302
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,110
Jackson said it made sense!

303
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,440
But it was swearing.

304
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,410
[What?]

305
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,350
[He rapped without thinking
and what a coincidence...]

306
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,980
- Seung Yoon!
- I'm sorry!

307
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,820
I was so surprised!

308
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,450
Next is... this is my very
first time meeting you.

309
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,960
[Who are you?]

310
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,790
I'm Ha Ha's senior from school.

311
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,260
My name is Kim Chang Geun.

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,030
Are they from the
same high school?

313
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,480
Hold on, hold on...

314
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,930
As long as you can search them up, right?

315
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,570
It's right!

316
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,870
He's from KAIST.

317
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,610
[Kim Chang Geun, Ha Ha's guest.]

318
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,810
You're the representative
director of Webzen?

319
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,010
But why are you here?

320
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,580
[I don't know, either.]

321
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,880
But why...

322
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,120
Hey, you!
What are you doing?

323
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,520
- I needed to fill up the spots...
- You need to control yourself!

324
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,860
Are you crazy?
You called Sung Mi...

325
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,790
How did you meet Ha Ha?

326
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,000
We met through cycling.

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,930
He's great at cycling.

328
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,170
He's very nosy.

329
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,770
It's so extreme.

330
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,410
He even called up Kim Chang Geun...

331
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,440
[Embarrassed]

332
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,850
Don't worry,
he called Oh Joong Seok as well.

333
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,980
And he's over there.

334
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,820
Are you close with Ju Yup?

335
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,650
I met him today.

336
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,090
[They're already best friends.]

337
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,630
People with mustaches get along
with other guys with mustaches...

338
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,100
[Mustache zone]

339
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
It's so funny.

340
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,330
And if we go back here.

341
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,240
[A new mustache face!]

342
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,140
[Kim Min Kyo, actor.]

343
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,940
Suk Jin called me.

344
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,040
He asked me to eliminate
some name tags.

345
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,780
So I thought I was a special guest.

346
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,080
I thought it was
two or three guests.

347
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,520
Everyone here's the same.

348
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Kwang Gyoo, too...

349
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,260
[Vacant]

350
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,590
[You said I would be a fixed member...]

351
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,790
Young Jun!

352
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,460
You're talking too much with Gary.

353
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,600
Sorry.

354
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
[Sorry]

355
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,940
[It's not class-time.]

356
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,710
You didn't do anything wrong!

357
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,040
He's asked me if we
validate parking tickets!

358
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,910
I told him not to worry!

359
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,810
I was worried.
I came too early.

360
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,210
[I've been here for four hours...]

361
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,220
And Got7 came to visit as well.

362
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,920
[All the members are here!]

363
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,620
[Got7, Jong Kook's guest.]

364
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,460
I invited them.
They're my junior singers.

365
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,030
They are competitive, too.

366
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,000
[In order of appearance: Jackson]

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,630
[Junior, Mark, Yugyeom]

368
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,370
[Young Jae, JB, Bam Bam.]

369
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,570
[There are seven young
and competitive members!]

370
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,070
It was so cool when
you did the tumbling.

371
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,870
Can you do it here?

372
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,410
[Yes, we can.]

373
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,540
- Please stand here.
- Okay.

374
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,150
[What is it?]

375
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,350
I was so shocked.

376
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,620
[The people in the back are
busy again, trying to see.]

377
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
I saw it on TV and was surprised.

378
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,790
[Everyone's standing
in the back row.]

379
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,320
[He's ready to film it again.]

380
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,160
[Takes it off]

381
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,500
[I will show you.]

382
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,960
Are you sure it's safe?

383
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,400
[Thrilled]

384
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,880
[A fancy back flip
that went over Jae Suk.]

385
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,250
[Amazing]

386
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,020
[Jumps, flips, push, and land.]

387
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,090
He pushed him mid-air!

388
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,900
[If there's Got7
in the world of idols]

389
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,000
[there's the Twins
in the world of comedy.]

390
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
[The acrobatic Twins
are on the move!]

391
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,140
[Intrigued]

392
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,580
Good luck!

393
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,850
[An eye for eye!
It's a back flip!]

394
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,420
[Wow!]

395
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,850
[Did they awaken Jackson?]

396
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,560
[Then let's just go home.]

397
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,460
[Bye bye!]

398
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,770
[Good job, Twins!]

399
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,370
[Stop!]

400
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,540
[There's a b-boy battle,
all of a sudden.]

401
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,480
[The Twins' specialty mid-air flip.]

402
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,380
[The audience is thrilled!]

403
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,380
[Mark's supportive fire!]

404
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,620
[The Twins are joint.]

405
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,160
[A high level
rotation technique!]

406
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
[Slap, slap]

407
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,330
[The atmosphere heats up
as the techniques get harder.]

408
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,370
[Spin]

409
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,540
[There's no giving up
in this battle.]

410
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,280
[Next is the Twins' turn!]

411
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,980
[The atmosphere is heating up...]

412
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,250
[They look like they have
no more techniques...]

413
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,290
If you don't have any left,
just stop!

414
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,290
[The battle ends here!]

415
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,660
[Fin]

416
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,190
[The perfect ending
for the final match.]

417
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,460
[The crowd goes wild!]

418
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,400
[It was a great break for the
tuckered out Running Men.]

419
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,510
Please give a big
round of applause!

420
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,080
[It's a festival!]

421
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,450
All of you said you were busy.

422
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,380
But now that there's so much to see

423
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,720
everyone seems to be enjoying it.

424
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,090
You're enjoying it, right?

425
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,550
Hyung Jun, are you okay?

426
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,390
[I love it here.]
He's been here for four hours.

427
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,130
- Sung Mi loved it.
- Did you like it?

428
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,830
It's like my 60th birthday.

429
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,140
[She likes their performance.]

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
[Meanwhile]

431
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,240
[What about the heroes?]

432
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,340
[They're training
before their big match.]

433
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,180
It's hard to
eliminate the name tags.

434
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,950
I'm so curious about our game.

435
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,490
[They can't just win with power!]

436
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,660
[Just you wait, Running Man.]

437
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,460
[40 vs. 40 mission time.]

438
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,830
[Running Man vs. The Heroes.]

439
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,830
<i>40 vs. 40!</i>

440
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,630
[What is this?]

441
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,930
<i>Mission time!</i>

442
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,970
[Wow]

443
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,910
[The Heroes are walking in]

444
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,250
[with No Ji Sim as their pillar!]

445
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,280
- There are so many.
- Right?

446
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,420
[Taekwondo, judo, ssireum, and
action actors are joined forces!]

447
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,890
[Gulp]

448
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,360
[Our opponent is... them?]

449
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,330
[Yes, that's right.]

450
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,570
[It's shocking to see them,
even for a second time.]

451
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,370
[The Team Heroes is more
intimidating with 40 members.]

452
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,640
They're so built.

453
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,840
[Shaking with fear.]

454
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,820
Some of their glares are...

455
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,390
40 vs. 40,
we will announce the mission.

456
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,750
The mission is

457
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,360
paper curling!

458
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,160
Everyone will line up.
Every other member of the same team.

459
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,170
You will throw a
roll of toilet paper.

460
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,870
The team that gets the most toilet paper
in the safe zone will win.

461
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,770
[Best two out of three.]

462
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,010
Ji Hyo and

463
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,410
Jong Kook, and you...

464
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,020
and you...

465
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,120
[There are 80 members in total.]

466
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,790
[That looks fun!]

467
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,400
[The gym is filled up with
all the big athletes.]

468
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,490
Isn't this such a large scale?

469
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,930
Throw it like this.

470
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,310
[There are people who are
receiving help from others.]

471
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,430
[There are people who don't
even have toilet paper.]

472
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,840
[People who have
met for the first time]

473
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,050
[have become friends.]

474
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,610
He looks so pretty.

475
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,580
We've invited some
of the greatest people...

476
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,650
Thank you so much.

477
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,550
Thank you.

478
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,260
We're very thankful.

479
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,590
[Mino, you're here too...]

480
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,760
[Thanks, Hyeong Tak.]

481
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,800
Yoon Bak, come here.

482
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,430
[Jae Suk is thankful
for his friends]

483
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,940
[who came without
knowing anything.]

484
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,070
- Can we practice, once?
- No.

485
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,110
If we practice,
we have to roll it up again.

486
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,540
[Please take good care of it.]

487
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm strong so it'll
fly all the way there.

488
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Prepare for round one!

489
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,580
Good luck!

490
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,320
[The key is to control the fingers.]

491
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,020
Good luck!

492
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,920
UEE, you can do it!

493
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,720
[Will it roll like
I'm expecting it to?]

494
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,790
UEE, you can do it!

495
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,430
[Weaklings like UEE]

496
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,800
[and strong athletes, all play fair.]

497
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:58,010
[They lost at the
head squash battle!]

498
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,240
[The lost the chance to reduce ten
members on Team Heroes.]

499
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,780
[What about this round?]

500
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,680
[No matter what happens]

501
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,350
[we need to win.]

502
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,890
[Lime vs. brown toilet paper rolls.]

503
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
[The 80 rolls of toilet paper rolls
are heading to the safe zone.]

504
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,770
[Some can't throw properly]

505
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,470
[and others bump into each other.]

506
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,580
[Chaos]

507
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,480
[Just then!]

508
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,950
It's here!

509
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,480
[The lime colored toilet paper roll
is moving forward!]

510
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,020
[It went in!]

511
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,190
[Team Running Man, succeeded.]

512
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,790
[Roll, roll]

513
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,530
[The brown toilet paper roll
is moving forward.]

514
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,700
[Team Heroes also succeeds!]

515
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,030
- That's mine!
- Good job!

516
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,740
Just a little bit more!

517
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,010
[He isn't cheering for his,
but the other team...]

518
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,310
[Whose side are you on.]

519
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,480
[The first round is over.]

520
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,650
Mr. Chang is cheating.

521
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,460
Mr. Chang!

522
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,930
Mr. Chang!

523
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,530
You can't cheat!

524
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,300
[You can't do that, here.]

525
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,040
[The legendary champion
is fighting with toilet paper...]

526
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,340
[Our team needs to win.]

527
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,440
There are four
lime colored rolls.

528
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,310
And two brown rolls.

529
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,790
[Their first victory!]

530
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,290
[Yes!]

531
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,860
[Team Running Man: one
vs. Team Heroes: nothing.]

532
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,130
[They're all happy together.]

533
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,560
If we win this, we can banish
ten of their members.

534
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,900
We can be at an advantage.

535
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,030
[They're preparing
for the next round.]

536
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,540
[They're loading their bullets.]

537
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,780
[Best two out of three.]

538
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
[Was it this fun to throw
a toilet paper roll...]

539
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,510
[The 80 members are all ready.]

540
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,520
You must win this round!

541
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,620
If Team Running Man wins, they can
banish ten members of the other team.

542
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,320
Just go one more time!

543
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,990
Ready!

544
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,260
One!

545
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,170
Two!

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
[Go!]

547
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,610
[The toilet paper rolls are
moving forward, once again.]

548
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,950
This one, this one!

549
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,420
[The lime toilet roll is
moving toward the safe zone.]

550
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,850
This one, this one!

551
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,190
[No way]

552
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,730
[And the results?]

553
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,760
[It went over...]

554
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,430
[Kwang Gyoo's roll that he kicked.]

555
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,140
[It's moving slowly,
just like his strength.]

556
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,010
[It reached the safe zone.]

557
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,310
[Mine made it!]

558
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,840
[Wow, that's amazing!]

559
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,480
[Super power Hyun Ju Yup.]

560
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,750
[Will he show off his skills here?]

561
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,590
[His made it!]

562
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,660
[Did you see that?]

563
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,090
We got two so far!

564
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,400
[The other team's score is
the only way to find out.]

565
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,870
[And the results?]

566
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,200
The results are in!

567
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,940
[Team Running Man two
vs. Team Heroes nothing.]

568
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,570
[Team Running Man won!]

569
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,480
[Wow!]

570
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,950
[We won!]

571
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,990
[They're celebrating like they're
in the World Cup quarter-finals.]

572
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,690
[This is better than that.]

573
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,660
[That was an amazing match.]

574
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,460
[They successfully banished
ten members from Team Heroes.]

575
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,570
[Disappointed]

576
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,340
We lost!

577
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,340
- That's hard.
- It is.

578
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
We've been training
with heavy dumbbells.

579
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,240
And I can't control my strength
with toilet paper.

580
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,650
[Just as Team Running Man
is seeing the light of day.]

581
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,160
[Someone is wearing full
cycling outerwear.]

582
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,490
[Is it one of Ha Ha's
cycling friends?]

583
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,360
How do I park this?

584
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,500
- Park?
- Yes.

585
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,930
I can't leave it here.
It's my other half.

586
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,890
[One hour and 52 minutes
before the final match.]

587
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,570
There are a lot of empty spots.

588
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,340
There are a lot here.

589
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,180
Did they really leave?

590
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,850
I saw some black outfits in the
garbage cans outside.

591
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,420
[They left to go home after
dumping their team outfits.]

592
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,650
[I've been here for four hours...]

593
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,220
But you guys have done so well
in the previous game.

594
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,690
We got our first victory!

595
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,160
[They banished ten members!]

596
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,630
[This isn't impossible!]

597
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,930
[Someone is here!]

598
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,540
[Who is the new savior?]

599
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,470
[Park Joon Hyung, Tim, Ducky, Wax]

600
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,510
[Hyun Woo, Ryu Hyun Kyung,
Lee Haneul.]

601
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,610
[It's Joon Hyung!]
I just came back from the jungle!

602
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,350
[Yo, brother!]

603
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,140
[Gary's guest, Ducky.]

604
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,130
[And Wax.]

605
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,660
[Hyun Kyung came, too.]

606
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,190
[I've seen him before?]

607
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,630
[Cyclist, Lee Haneul.]

608
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,230
[He's such a free soul.]

609
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,740
- You got so tan!
- It's because of SBS!

610
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,910
[Calm down.]

611
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,680
You don't even feed me!

612
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,050
[He's in agreement.]

613
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,780
[He's dying at his motor mouth.]

614
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,450
Thank you for coming today.

615
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,450
We'll introduce
the guests, briefly.

616
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,450
So Lee Haneul,
who were you invited by?

617
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,890
Ha Ha.

618
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,460
Why did you come in
your cycling outerwear?

619
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,290
I got a call while I was riding.

620
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,360
- Really?
- The ride back was originally my course.

621
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,700
So it wasn't that far.

622
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,730
Did you know we were
eliminating name tags, today?

623
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,970
- Me, too?
- Yes.

624
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,200
Uh huh.

625
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,140
[If you knew who your opponent was,
you wouldn't be so relaxed...]

626
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Please be healthy.

627
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,540
[A healthy and a long life.]

628
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,450
[Yes, yes]

629
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,820
And next is...

630
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,750
He's Ducky!

631
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,390
Hello, I'm Gary's guest,
B-boy Ducky.

632
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,920
- Ducky!
- B-boy!

633
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,460
He was a B-boy world champion.

634
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,860
[2009 Freestyle Session Japan Winner]
[2006 Korea, Battle Of the Year Winner]

635
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,990
[2002 UK B-Boy championship Winner]
[2002 Germany, Battle Of the Year Winner]

636
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,030
You don't look like b-boy at all.

637
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,800
Like Kim Chang Geun

638
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,640
you look like an IT guy.

639
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,870
May I request to show your dance?

640
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,670
Sure, I'll do that.

641
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,380
He's a world champion,
I'm exited to see his dance.

642
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,180
We have a member
who does b-boying.

643
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,390
Is it okay to show us
like a dance battle?

644
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,150
Please, come forward.

645
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,650
[B-boy world champion Ducky's
opponent is JB of GOT7.]

646
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,330
[GOT7 Dance Machine JB vs.
The Korean B-boy Legend Ducky]

647
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,930
He's a good dancer.

648
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,700
He's been dancing for a long time.
I'd say he's the first generation b-boy.

649
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,240
[He starts warming up.]

650
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,240
[The little brother starts first!]

651
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:08,380
[Flashy steps and powerful moves!]

652
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,080
[Good job, my friend!]

653
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,660
[The World Champion enters.]

654
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,790
[Slightly nervous]

655
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,760
[This is the original b-boying!]

656
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,830
[Powerful break dance!]

657
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,270
[Tremendous!]

658
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,210
[An extraordinary spin!]

659
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,310
[Wow!]

660
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,960
[His legs move nineteen
to the dozen at the speed of LTE.]

661
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,390
[Let me take a break!]

662
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,490
[I ain't that bad, aren't I?]

663
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,260
[He's a world champion, indeed!]

664
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,360
[Here's goes JB again!]

665
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,760
[If the big brother does it,
the younger brother does it, too.]

666
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,900
[Good job!]

667
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,430
[It's spectacular.]

668
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,430
His attitude changed!

669
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,270
[This is the world class b-boying!]

670
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,350
Please give them a round of applause!

671
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,020
I feel like I'm having
an early 60th birthday party.

672
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,600
- Are you enjoying it?
- Of course!

673
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,290
Everyone looks they're
having a good time.

674
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,260
They're really really good!

675
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,400
And the next up is "BBBAAAAMMM"!

676
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,930
Yo!

677
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,200
[Jong Kook's guest]
[Park Joon Hyung, Singer]

678
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
It feels like we're in
California all of a sudden.

679
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,270
I think it's enough for him.

680
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,910
This "BBBAAAAMMM" says
everything about him, "BBBAAAAMMM"!

681
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,080
BBBAAAAMMM!

682
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,040
[I'm a good dancer, too.]

683
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,480
Didn't you just come back
from filming "Law of the Jungle"?

684
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,120
- Yes.
- When did you come back?

685
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,750
I came back yesterday morning.

686
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,620
After sleeping for four hours

687
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,340
I got a phone call from Jong Kook,
so I came.

688
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,820
[No time for the jet leg!]

689
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,390
But, I have lack of sleep.
I will say strange things.

690
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,260
He's such a kid.

691
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,100
What?
Is this a battle?

692
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,140
[All of a sudden, a dance battle
between the elders!]

693
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,840
[Haneul starts dancing
in his cycling gear.]

694
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,980
[Come at me first!]

695
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,080
[I'm coming!]

696
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,790
[He's going in between his legs.]

697
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,260
[Taken off]

698
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,300
[An emerald head shyly appears.]

699
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,030
[The audience is burnt to the ground.]

700
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,170
[I'm not done yet!]
[He sparks up again.]

701
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,310
"BBBAAAAMMM" is the best!

702
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,710
[Here we go!]

703
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,980
['Class is permanent.' - Bill Shankly]

704
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,620
[And Brother Jun takes the baton.]

705
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,620
Show us the old dance!
[B-boying in his 40s!]

706
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,430
[Oh my knees!]

707
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,000
[Wriggle, wriggle]

708
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,470
[I'll show you, look closely!]

01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:49,210
[I can't believe it!]

1562
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:54,300
[They lost Mr. Capable
at the Heroes' pincer movement.]

1563
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:59,180
[We did it!]

1564
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,840
- No, Jong Kook can't leave!
- It's okay.

1565
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,760
We still have more people.

1566
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,890
Gather together, we have more people!

1567
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:17,880
We need to stick together!

1568
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,370
We have more people!

1569
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,630
[That was so close...]

1570
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:25,050
Think it as two on one!

1571
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:28,260
[Attack!]
Go around them!

1572
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,760
[Run]

1573
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,790
[Good job!]

1574
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:40,330
[Rip]

1575
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,720
[Rip]

1576
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:47,410
[In a flash, the Heroes are
ousted one after another.]

1577
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:51,470
[This is the complete opposite
from the first round]

1578
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:56,970
[They work in perfect harmony,
they help each other.]

1579
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:58,760
Help them!

1580
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:03,080
[Team Running Man is fighting so well.]

1581
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,370
[They're our opponents,
but they're good.]

1582
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:11,470
[The Heroes are surrounded.]

1583
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:15,970
Corner them!

1584
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:19,600
[Moving in perfect order]
[All starts attacking!]

1585
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,600
[Rip]

1586
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:29,040
[We'll end this soon for you.]

1587
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,300
You did it very well!

1588
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,760
[The second round went as they planned.]

1589
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,230
[Team Running Man wins the second round.]

1590
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:46,220
[The Heroes won the first round,
but lost the second round.]

1591
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:54,140
[Now, they're 1:1, but they're
worried about the third round.]

1592
01:27:55,230 --> 01:28:00,840
[Only the members who haven't played
can be in the third round.]

1593
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,270
[Will we be able to win?]

1594
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:07,800
Gather here!
For the third round!

1595
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:12,720
Let's cheer!

1596
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:25,330
[The strongest members,
Lee Won Hee and Kim Ki Tae are entering.]

1597
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:26,800
They have so many members!

1598
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,260
[Majestic]

1599
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,760
We have so few.

1600
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,870
Because 34 members were
playing for the second round.

1601
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,090
[Our strategy worked!]

1602
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,750
They're too strong!

1603
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,510
<i>Running Man, 100 vs. 100</i>

1604
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:46,040
<i>The name tag elimination mission!</i>

1605
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,760
<i>Final round!</i>

1606
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,330
[The last battle of the race]

1607
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:59,130
[With this one round,
the winner will be decided.]

1608
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:03,970
[No matter who our opponent is,
we won't run scared!]

1609
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,380
Stick together!

1610
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:16,950
[As other times, Running Man
members are gathered together.]

1611
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,890
[This is the time!]

1612
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,840
<i>Hold hands, and surround
them as if we are a fish net.</i>

1613
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,300
<i>[A human net!]</i>

1614
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,590
[As soon as the third round starts,
they carry out their plan!]

1615
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:40,200
[Running Man is surrounded
by the human net!]

1616
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:44,170
[What in the world is that?]

1617
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:48,080
[They lock them up in
one spot and attack!]

1618
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,090
[Big-nosed Brother is ousted!]

1619
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:51,850
[Rip]

1620
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:56,790
[So many of the Running Man
members are gone to the wall.]

1621
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:59,460
[Yoo Hyuk who's fast tries leaving.]

1622
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,520
[The Grasshopper's in the net.]

1623
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,180
[Rip]

1624
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,720
[Chaos]

1625
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,020
My shoe!

1626
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:13,670
It's over there!

1627
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:16,470
[She wears her shoes
and goes back to the battlefield.]

1628
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:19,580
[Where did my name tag go?]

1629
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:23,840
[It's inside his hair.]

1630
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,880
Am I ousted or not?

1631
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,370
You're not ousted.

1632
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:31,800
Because it's just stuck to your hair.

1633
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:38,760
[The name tag was stuck to
his own hair, so he's not ousted.]

1634
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,010
[The Heroes are holding hands again!

1635
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:47,140
[They shouldn't be surrounded again...]

1636
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:50,270
Corner them again!
[Stomp, stomp]

1637
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,760
[They're coming.]

1638
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,840
Fight!

1639
01:30:55,630 --> 01:31:00,080
[Hand in hand, the human net
goes one more time.]

1640
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,580
[Again, they're completely surrounded.]

1641
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,340
[What do we do?]

1642
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:10,460
[They're ousted thick and fast again!]

1643
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,090
Grab them!

1644
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:18,560
[The rest are helpless.]

1645
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,700
[Rip]

1646
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,800
[Running Man is about to exterminated.]

1647
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:30,600
[In the meantime, a man ran far away.]

1648
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,410
[Seung Kwan of Seventeen]

1649
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:41,300
[DK from Seventeen becomes
the target and runs away!]

1650
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,550
[I'm so sorry.]
Do Kyeom

1651
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:49,590
[At last, Do Kyeom is ousted.]

1652
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:56,890
[Therefore, there's
only one member left]

1653
01:31:56,890 --> 01:32:00,230
[It's Seung Kwan of Seventeen.]

1654
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,340
Only one left?

1655
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:07,080
[The Heroes vs. Running Man]
[18:1]

1656
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,920
Let's do one on one!

1657
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,590
One on one!
One on one!

1658
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:18,500
[I might possibly win,
if it's one on one match.]

1659
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,040
[But his opponent is Lee Won Hee.]

1660
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:28,600
[Lee Won Hee vs. Seung Kwan]

1661
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,470
Boo Seung Kwan!
Boo Seung Kwan!

1662
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,010
Isn't he Lee Won Hee?

1663
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:37,630
That gold medalist Lee Won Hee?

1664
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:43,300
[The two men become serious
before the battle.]

1665
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,890
[In an instant]

1666
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,420
[Grab]

1667
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:56,590
[What just happened?]

1668
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:00,160
[Seung Kwan is cute!]

1669
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,520
[He grabs Seung Kwan
by the collar quickly]

1670
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,980
[and attacks his name tag!]

1671
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,840
[Rip]

1672
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:14,140
[The last runner, Seung Kwan is ousted.]

1673
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:19,970
[Team Heroes wins the third round!]

1674
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:25,630
[With two wins and one loss,
the Heroes win the game.]

1675
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:30,550
[Is this all over?]

1676
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:32,520
Thank you so much!

1677
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:40,760
Thank you so much for
staying with us for a long time.

1678
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,920
Director Jong Doo Hong, Coach No Ji Sim

1679
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,340
Director Lee Won Hee, Taemi

1680
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,790
Director Yook

1681
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:58,380
and all the athletes who came today,
thank you again!

1682
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,370
[Thank you, 100 Heroes!]

1683
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:03,460
Some of our guests had to go

1684
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:08,750
but thank you for staying
with us until this late.

1685
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:16,130
Thank you again!

1686
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:21,040
The final winner is the Heroes!

1687
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:27,270
[Regardless of winning or losing,
it's good to be together!]

1688
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:34,330
<i>[A few hours ago, 100 vs. 100 mission
sounded like a helpless one.]</i>

1689
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:43,160
<i>[But we had friends
who were a phone call away.]</i>

1690
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,500
<i>[A hundred of them!]</i>

1691
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,870
<i>[We became one like that]</i>

1692
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:53,300
<i>[and we were able to spend
wonderful time together.]</i>

1693
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:59,170
They're so strong!

1694
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,950
My daughter is a
big fan of Running Man.

1695
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,670
One, two, three!

1696
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,260
My handwriting looks bad.

1697
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,760
You look good!
You're in such a good shape!

1698
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,800
Thank you for your work!

1699

who made today an exciting festival.]
