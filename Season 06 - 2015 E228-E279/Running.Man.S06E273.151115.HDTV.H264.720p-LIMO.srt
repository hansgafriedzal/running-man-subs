[They're still in shock from
the 100 vs. 100 battle.]

I had a drink with Geun Sik yesterday.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,170
He was so upset.

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,970
- Geun Sik grabbed him first.
- He didn't know.

34

had a drink together.

35

We put all our strongest people
in the first and second round.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,790
There were only people like me
left for the third round.

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,610
There were only weaklings
during the third round.

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,370
It was like a war between
ants and humans.

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,440
I looked around, and all of a sudden

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,520
there were like four people
surrounding me.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,410
When people see it on TV,
they think it's easy.

42
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,260
But when they actually try it...

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
But you saw everyone
yesterday, right?

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,430
As soon as a game started,
everyone went crazy.

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,570
Jinu was in the back.

46
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,520
But as soon as he went up,
he fought with everything he had.

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,770
[That's natural for
the name tag game.]

48
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,990
Seriously...

49
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,950
We would have never
seen Chang Jung Koo.

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,010
- That was an honor!
- He's a hero.

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,020
I'd never imagined I'd throw
toilet paper rolls with him...

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,300
And I didn't think he would cheat.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,370
It was an honor, and we're thankful.

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,920
I bet he enjoyed it though, when else
would he get to do these things?

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,520
I got a text from Sung Mi saying
that she had a great time.

56

I don't know what we're doing today

57
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,080
but it's not easy to beat us
when we're a team.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,570
Where's our opponent?

a long day, listening to him.

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,050
When I break up with my boyfriend

356
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,680
- are you going to date me?
- No.

357
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,980
[Sad...]

358
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,520
Jong Kook will accept you
if you keep trying.

359
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,690
[Really?]

360
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,690
Jae Joon and Eun Hyung have
been dating a long time.

361
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,320
It's been seven years.

362
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,690
- The award acceptance speech.
- Many people remember it.

363
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,000
Congratulations, Kang Jae Joon.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,940
My girlfriend is Lee Eun Hyung.

365
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm going to marry her!

366
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,540
Eun Hyung, I love you!

367
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,140
We are going to get married soon.

368
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,780
[Wow!]

369
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,910
January or February of next year...

370
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,080
You didn't know?

371
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,490
Really?

372
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,220
This is how it kept

373
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,960
getting delayed.

374
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,590
You wanted to, but you couldn't?

375
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,230
- We had a slump.
- PLL wasn't doing really good.

376
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,900
I was curious, but wasn't PLL
stopped for some time?

377
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
After PLL disappeared,
we were helpless.

378
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,870
We were hoping that it
would return again.

379
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,740
We just kept making new sketches
in a little theater in Daehang-ro.

380
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,710
That really gave us strength.

381
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,880
That's what made us today.

382
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,750
We can just perform now.

383
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,520
What about Gun Young?

384
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,950
He was a staffer for
"Infinity Challenge."

385
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,020
[Have I ever seen him?]

386
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,290
I worked as an assistant cameraman, too.

387
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,630
- I worked hard.
- And then you became a comedian?

388
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,130
We're living together.

389
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,070
To be honest, unless you're
a fixed member on PLL

390
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,520
it's hard to pay for rent...

391
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,970
What do you do?

392
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,540
When PLL disappeared in 2010

393
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,110
I worked part-time as security

394
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,580
at the mart across the street.

395
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,790
[He didn't have any other choice]

396
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,290
[but to survive.]

397
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,990
I worked for two months
and no one recognized me.

398
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,830
And then one day,
as I was greeting customers.

399
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,430
One of the comedians recognized me.

400
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,570
- It was Comedian Son Byung Eun.
- I know her.

401
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,340
She gave me lots of advice

402
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,370
and she helped me come back.

403
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,180
- And parents...
- can be against it.

404
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,750
I prepared to be a comedian
discretely for two years.

405
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,920
They were against it,
but when I appear on TV

406
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,150
they love it.

407
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,720
[That's how parents are.]

408
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,530
How many years has it
been for you, Hyun Jung?

409
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,830
- It should be like ten years.
- Yes, it's been ten years.

410
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,800
Her colleague is Jung Joo Ri.

411
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,070
Joo Ri appeared in different programs,
but I wasn't able...

412
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,810
Can't you invite me on
"Happy Together"?

413
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,440
[Let's be happy together.]

414
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,110
[Flustered]

415
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,810
Why are you talking about a KBS
program on Running Man?

416
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,920
Or just ask for
"Infinity Challenge."

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,520
Can I be on "Infinite Challenge"?

418
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,050
Are you asking me?

419
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,960
He doesn't have a solid ground, either.

420
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,730
What are you saying?

421
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,530
[Makdoongie, isn't
Running Man enough?]

422
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,300
Let's not get swayed
by Running Man.

423
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,500
You need to do well!

424
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,670
Let's not get swayed by them.

425
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,110
Serious, let's win this!

426
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,240
[They get motivated!]

427
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,150
[The Laughter War]
[Number two. The laugh triathlon]

428
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,450
["P" University Stadium, Seoul]
The weather is really nice.

429
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,020
They're coming!

430
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,650
They're here!

431
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,090
Hello!

432
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,590
[We're here, brothers!]

433
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,290
How many are there?

434
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,000
[Fighting spirit is charged!]

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
[On alert]

436
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,830
Let's go Running Man and PLL!

437
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,040
Jung Hwan is here.

438
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,570
He always brightens up the mood in
"Same Bed Different Dreams."

439
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,200
Jung Hwan is on
"Same Bed Different Dreams"

440
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,840
every morning as a warmup MC.

441
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,510
He comes every morning
for that short amount of time.

442
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,080
For the audience,
when they arrive.

443
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,850
Can you show us a little bit?

444
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,260
[We want to see!]

445
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,030
Thank you for coming today!
Please give a round of applause!

446
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,360
[The atmosphere is good!]

447
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,200
- Two, two!
- Three, four!

448
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,970
- Bird goes?
- Chirp, chirp.

449
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,440
That's so surprising.

450
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,110
[Use a quick wit test to
bring up the atmosphere.]

451
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,610
[Their teamwork improved,
already.]

452
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,950
[This time, it's time to test
Team Running Man!]

453
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,880
- One, two!
- Three, four!

454
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,420
- Two, two!
- Three, four!

455
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,120
- Bird goes?
- Chirp, chirp!

456
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,050
- Cat goes?
- Meow, meow!

457
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,020
Turtle?

458
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,690
- Stretch, stretch!
- What do you mean stretch?

459
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,960
[For some reason,
they really want to win at this...]

460
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,030
[Make a battle between
the two teams to raise]

461
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,400
[to raise their participation.]

462
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,900
- One, two!
- Three, four!

463
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,400
- Two, two!
- Three, four!

464

- Running!

- National!
- Singing Contest!

00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,740
- AB!
- CD!

468
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,180
[Team PLL is this good.]

469
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,080
[Let's do well, too!]

470
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,550
[We can do it!]

471
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,890
Turtle goes crawl, crawl!

472
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,860
[Wake up!]

473
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,120
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

[We've been tricked again!]

484
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,150
Please give a big round of
applause to Jung Hwan!

485
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,570
[His devilish MC skills.]

486
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,010
It gets me to focus quickly!

487
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,500
He sweats for 30 minutes
and leaves.

488
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,570
[A hidden supporter
that gives all his energy.]

489
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,230
There's such a difference when
Jung Hwan MC's and when he doesn't.

490
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,170
It got me pumped!

491
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,350
- I learned it from Dong Yup...
- He learned it from someone, too.

492
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,810
It's a cycle,
there's always someone.

493
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,280
Can we see Dong Yup's version?

494
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,610
- Let's see Dong Yup's version!
- Jung Hwan already did everything...

495
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,080
[The expert warm-up MC is up!]

496
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,210
A round of applause from PLL!

497
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,520
[Wait]

498
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,390
When they become an expert,
it's not just "applause."

499
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,460
It's more slurred!

500
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,320
It's free and casual.

501
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,500
The tone is different.

502
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,730
It's a little different.

503
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,570
[Lee Dong Yup's version
is about to start!]

504
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,740
- One, two!
- Three, four!

505
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,200
- Two, two!
- Three, four!

506
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,910
- Choo, choo!
- Chug, chug!

507
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,610
- Choo, choo, choo!
- Chug, chug, chug!

508
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,640
- The best comedian?
- Lee Dong Yup!

509
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,180
- A comedian that you like?
- Lee Dong Yup!

510
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,810
- A successful comedian?
- Lee Dong Yup!

511
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,680
- Choo, choo!
- Chug, chug!

512
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,250
- Choo, choo, choo!
- Chug, chug, chug!

513
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,720
Choo, choo, choo, choo,
choo, choo, choo.

514
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,550
Chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug.

515
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,820
Wow!

516
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,120
- Choo, choo, choo!
- Chug, chug, chug!

517
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,630
[That's the best!]

518
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,260
[Team Running Man, we can do it too!]

519
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,630
It's not hard.

520
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,200
- Choo, choo, choo!
- Chug, chug, chug!

521
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,940
Choo, choo, choo, choo,
choo, choo, choo.

522
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,570
Chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug.

523
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,970
I will do it on my own!

524
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,140
Sorry, we were practicing!

525
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,210
We're just practicing.

526
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,080
[Okay, let's try it again!]

527
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,550
- One, two!
- Three, four!

528
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,180
- Two, two!
- Three, four!

529

533
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,520
- The best comedian?
- Lee Dong Yup!

534
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
- A comedian that you like?
- Lee Dong Yup!

A comedian that you don't like!
You aren't thinking!

539
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,640
[We've been tricked again!]

540
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,140
[Team Running Man's last chance.]

[What?]

547
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,990
[A qualified rehearsing MC.]

548
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,560
This is so much fun!

549
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,390
I want to have a day
of just recreation.

550
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,900
[Now that we've warmed up,
its time for the real battle!]

551
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,270
We will start the triathlon.

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,940
The first game is

553
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,570
face battle.

554
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,110
You must wear stockings
that are tied to the pole

555
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,180
and stack five yogurt drink
bottles quickly, to win.

556
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,020
I love stuff like this.

557
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,720
This is made for comedians.

558
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Who will go first on Team PLL?

559
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,660
We'll have Kang Hyun go first.

560
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,230
His face is overwhelming.

561
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,950
[The aura of a comedian.]

562
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,120
- So we have Kang Hyun...
- And what about Gary?

563
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,520
We'll have Gary!

564
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,750
[He's slightly alerted.]

565
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,210
They look alike!

566
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,120
- They look alike!
- There's a similarity...

567
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,410
Kang from Jinju clan?
Which generation?

568
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,050
Who cares?

569
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,020
His face is very overwhelming.

570
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,420
[Both participants are]

571
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,420
[heading to the battlefield.]

572
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,960
[His back is already humorous.]

573
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,900
I can't see!

574
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,670
Gary!

575
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,310
[His hip-hop charisma is gone.]

576
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,980
If I do this and lose,
I'd be really upset.

577
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,920
[I've met a strong opponent...]

578
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,590
[Extreme visual]

579
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,690
I've lost my pride.

580
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,730
[They managed to raise their motivation,
will they be able to win?]

581
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,560
Ready... start!

582
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
[Round one: Gary vs. Kang Hyun.]

583
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,200
[They're already speeding up.]

584
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,740
[Oh my!]

585
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,480
[He had to break due to
the stretchy stockings.]

586
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,650
[The visual brothers can't
hide their struggle.]

587
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,790
[With one mistake,
the tower flopped down.]

588
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,160
[Just a little more...]

589
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,360
[This is a first...]

590
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,500
How do you even make this face?

591
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
Ow!

592
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,270
Gary, you look second to none.

593
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,270
[That's a compliment, right?]

594
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,140
You look like salted pollack roe!

595
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,380
[Salted pollack roe]

596
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,150
[Gary managed to
stack four bottles.]

597
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,720
He sort of looks like Je Dong.

598
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,050
[Kang Hyun needs to stack two more!]

599
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,620
[Gary's on his last.
Kang Hyun needs two more.]

600
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,390
[I can't...]

601
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,960
[Gary completed the tower!]

602
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,130
[Team Running Man won the
first round of face battle!]

603
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,370
Gary won!

604
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,940
[Good job, my brother!]

605
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,110
Gary looked just as
bad as Kang Hyun.

606
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,480
[Team Running Man one vs. PLL zero.]

607
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,990
Jae Joon will go up this time!

608
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,090
Lee Soo Hwan!

609
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,760
[Let's play fair.]

610
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,960
They're a little similar.

611

[Slide]

612
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,010
How do you win that?

[Visual big match!]

614
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,580
Ready, set...

[Round two of face battle, start!]

616
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,120

[Relaxed]

618
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,260
[Squeeze]

619
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,930
[Wow]

620
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,660
[The face revolution!]

621
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,270
[Full of surprises]

622
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,400
[Let me take a picture with you.]

623
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,170
What are you doing?
[I need to record this rare event!]

[Collapsed]

625

Jae Jun, Jae Jun!
[This is a chance!]

626
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,320
[Okay, it's a good chance!]

627
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,420
He can't see anything.

628
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,850
[His eyes are completely closed.]
[How come I can't see anything?]

629
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,960
[Where is the table?]

630
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,220
[Oh, it's right here.]

631
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,630
[As soon as he gets to the table,
his eyes are closed.]

632
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,600
He can't see it at all.

633
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,500
[Pawing the air]
My stomach hurts!

makes a final burst.]

[Kang Jae Jun completes
the yogurt tower!]

641
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,570

the second round of "Face Battle."]

[I want to open my eyes!]

645
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,510
Soo Han couldn't do it because
he was able to see up to this point.

646
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,170
But, it got tight and
made his eyes close.

647
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,080
He calculated over there, but...

648
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,060
You can't really see anything?

649
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,160
Give them a round of applause!

650
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,410
[For Jae Jun and Soo Han
who made us laugh!]

651
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,960
I've never laughed so hard
in the past five years.

652
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,730
Do you have anything
that you can show us, Soo Han?

653
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,940
- Anything better than this...
- I think I've shown everything.

654
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,510

[Laugh Triathlon]
[Running Man vs. PLL]

658
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,960
The second game is to
test your expression.

659
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,060
And the title is
"Speak While You Jump."

660
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,810
A rep will play jump rope
and explain the quiz by gestures.

661
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,170
The rest of the team
will solve the problem.

662
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,880
You have 100 seconds to do the game.

663
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,920
We need someone who's really expressive.

664
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,570
That person will be...

665
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,610
how about Jae Young?

666
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,480
[Cobong falls into the
category of slapstick.]

In my opinion, you're
clapping for nothing.

first time makes them very excited.]

The new members are at the very back.

You need to listen to
everyone's opinion.

675

I only noticed three people speaking.

676

three groups and the five groups.

on mind for their sketches.

779
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,470

- Makdoongie.
- Hyun Jung is putting on makeup.

795
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,220
You should pick Jong Kook.

796
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,490
It's not a heavy role,
it's going to be very short.

797

Kim Jong Kook!
[Kkuk is chosen!]

798

816
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,060
Gary feels awkward with
this kind of stuff.

817
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,990
Unlike the other groups,
they don't look so happy about it.

What's his role?

829
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,860
I think he should be
the one who's awkward, as well.

830
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,280
- Is that right?
- Yes.

831
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,060
If I memorize the line...

832
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,390
I'm sure I'll say it awkwardly like,
"I'm sick."

833
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,790
It'd be better if I just follow
the situation and act.

834
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,470
Gary has acted for movies, too.

835
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,150
Started his career with "Dachimawa Lee."

836

[Gary's retro hair style suits him.]

As a member of a Korean independence
army who disguised as a Japanese spy.

838
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,420
And he acted as a drunk man
in "Wonderful Radio."

839

[Ji Hyo is an immature girlfriend.]
We didn't today, I want it!

844

If I buy it again today,
my wallet will be empty.

Then, the seat right next to you
will be surely empty, too!

I'll become a snake.

What if I can't do this?

861
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,060
You need to make
a fool out of yourself.

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,350
Thank god, I didn't take that role.
I couldn't possibly act like that.

873
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,970
When I'm timid, I become a coward.

874
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,230
But you did a good job taking
the comic role in "My Boss, My Teacher."

875
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,810
No, not at all.

876
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,950
You'll probably standing
up on that side.

877
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,230
After saying "yes,"
it's my turn, right?

878
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,230
[Serious]

879
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,500
What is it?
Is Gary acting?

880
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,750
Keep quiet, do you know
what the detailed acting is?

881
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,790
[Actor Kang Gary is
absorbed into acting.]

882
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,930
I've read the script.

883
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,170
This is a sketch,
but I don't have any funny lines...

884
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,500
I only have kissing scenes...

885
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,940
We had a meeting together
but Hyun Jung wrote the script.

886
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:19,320
At least, when you guys
have action scenes

887
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,350
I could protect her or something.

888
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,660
- There's a scene.
- Is there?

889
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,830
I usually do an ad-lib
around that time.

890
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,390
Didn't we say we'll have
a new member today?

891
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,630
Yes, I recruited a really good man.

892
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,880
Nice to meet you, I'm Makdoongie.

893
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,330
By any chance, are you Hyun Jung?

894
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,320
No, it's "my first love Hyun Jung."

895
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,830
I love you, but I hate when
someone says the line wrong.

896
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,810
I draw a distinct line between
public and private matters.

897
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,080
By any chance, are you
my first love Hyun Jung?

898
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,830
- Jong Kook...
- Didn't you say I'm your first love?

899
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,060
Who are you?

900
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,680
[Grabbing by the collar]

901
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,610
[While he was acting,
he accidentally punched his chin.]

902
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,550
Did you just punch my brother?

903
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,230
[What is Makdoongie doing?]

904
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,430
- How dare you?
- Whose side are you on?

905
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:18,680
Just grab me tough, then I'll say.
"Please, let go."

906
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,190
[Polite]

907
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:25,260
When you let go of me,
then you can talk with her.

908
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,520
[Gary and the Awkward Boknam team
are practicing on stage.]

909
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,810
I think it's good that you said
Ji Hyo twice.

910
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,030
[Giraffe praised Gary's acting.]

911
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,430
Don't explain to me.
Are you trying to teach me?

912
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,370
- Did you record that?
- Was he giving you a lesson?

913
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,660
- Did he give you a lesson?
- Yes, he did.

914
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,480
I know what I'm doing!

915
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,770
- My pride has been hurt.
- He started acting way before than you!

916
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,500
He was in "Dachimawa Lee."

917
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,480
I started acting in
"My Dad Is a Bodyguard."

918
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,280
[An hour before the show]

919
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,910
[Team Running Man
is working hard to practice.]

920
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,770
[The show time is near, and the script
seems even more confusing.]

921
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,500
[No matter what, I need to
memorize the lines.]

922
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,810
Jae Hun, I want to eat a steak!
[Ji Hyo has to get used to the tone.]

923
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,400
We had that yesterday,
let's eat something else.

924
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,570
Don't swear!
It's okay.

925
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,810
I'm so sorry.
[I'm afraid...]

926
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,410
[Gary is nervous, too.]

927
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,210
[The more I look at the script,
the more confusing it seems.]

928
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,080
I'm sorry.
[He's so serious.]

929
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,450
I confused the order of the lines.

930
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:49,190
- You should put yourself in my shoes.
- You have a lot lines.

931
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,030
You have to act at the right time.

932
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,520
I have to quickly act
right after they say.

933
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,630
[If he gets the timing wrong,
the sketch will be ruined.]

934
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,210
[Worried]

935
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,040
Boknam gives the stethoscope to Gary.
Gary examines Boknam.

936
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,710
[Gary looks like as if he's going
to memorize the whole script.]

937
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,370
This will be removed.

938
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,170
Let's do it again, I need to
memorize it anyway.

939
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,420
[Practice makes perfect.]

940
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,490
[Kkuk's team is at the
peak of practice, too.]

941
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,590
At this moment, you need to block
and move to that side.

942
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,080
No, we're used to do it from here.

943
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,470
Because, I have to punch
and move like this at the end.

944
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,170
But, Jong Kook will be standing here
and he has to push me.

945
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,280
- But pushing...
- Then from where and how?

946
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,300
Do we have enough space for that?

947
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,510
How about doing this?

948
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,610
- That's pointless.
- What should we do?

949
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,950
[30 minutes before the show,
the audience gathers slowly.]

950
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,990
[She keeps staring at the script.]

951
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,590
[Read and memorize,
that's the only way to go!]

952
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,290
Then, the seat right next to you
will be empty, too!

953
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,400
- It's "surely empty."
- Will be surely empty, too!

954
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,810
This is so embarrassing,
it's driving me nuts!

955
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:17,110
[As the showtime is near,
their head blanks out.]

956
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,660
[Kkuk is rehearsing on stage.]

957
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,990
I'm so nervous.

958
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,830
[The movement at the
right timing is really important!]

959
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,970
[Will they be able to do
as they practiced?]

960
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,500
[While they're busy practicing,
the audience has started to enter.]

961
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,120
[They couldn't possibly imagine that
Running Man members are here.]

962
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,950
[The theater is almost full.]

963
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,410
[Backstage, everyone seems busy.]

964
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,980
[Gary is the first one to perform out
of all the Running Man members.]

965
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,370
- Good luck!
- Gary!

966
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,370
It's good to do it first.

967
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,700
If the person before you does it well,
you feel more pressure.

968
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,750
Also, it means he'll finish early.
[Envy]

969
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,760
Could you put the microphone
on my right cheek?

970
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,920
I have a thing.

971
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,790
[He even avoid his jinx, to act better.]

972
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:21,240
If you don't buy me a steak,
I'll become a snake.

973
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,350
[Ji Hyo acts like Actor Song today.]

974
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,750
That's too bad!

975
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,210
[Team Running Man checks with
the action meticulously.]

976
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,180
[Team PLL is getting
ready for the show.]

977
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,170

[she transforms into Big Mama.]
(Chef Lee Hye Jung)

979
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,950
[They're used to their roles]

980
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,280
[but they keep practicing.]

981
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,060
Good luck, PLL!

982
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,060
[We'll win the Laughter War!]

983
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,860
[It's showtime!]

984
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,910
[The audience can't imagine they'll
be able to see Running Man here.]

985
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:05,480
[Finally, the stage lights turn on]

986
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:11,230
[and Running Man members
appear on stage.]

987
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,860
[the audience starts screaming.]

988

[Scream]

I'll tell you why we're here.

994

We're filming the Laughter War today.

995
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,080
We've filmed the first part last week

996
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,830
and we're filming the
second part with you today.

997

- Are you excited?
- Yes!

999
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,260

take place here is...

the Laughter War begins now!]

to a big applause.]

- Yes.

00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,280
[Nervous]

- Yes!

1025
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,450
Here's sugar for you!
(Chef Baek's nickname is the Sugar Boy.)

1026

[His lips became parched
out of nervousness.]

1027
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,190
And you set a fire!

1028
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,230
This is how I burn vegetables
and eat only meat!

1029
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,870
[Oh, my god!]

1030
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,790

Garam, why do you want
to break up with me?

1037
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,570
Do you love another woman?

1038
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,300
It's nothing like that.
Watch your mouth, we're in the clinic.

Then what's the reason?

1041
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,550
I said what's the reason?

1042
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,430
I think I've got a cold.

1043
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,520
[Good luck, Gary!]

1044
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,120
You left your stethoscope
at the x-ray room.

1045
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,350
- The x-ray room, I'll be right back.
- Mr. Oh, wait!

1046
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,530
[Boknam goes to the back,
it's Gary's turn.]

1047
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,390
[Oh, no!]

1048
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,300
[Finally...]

1049
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,950
[to the stage!]

1050
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:06,010
<i>[Awkward Boknam's choice is Kang Gary.]</i>

1051
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,460
<i>That's so awkward!</i>

1052
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,570
<i>Gary was feeling uneasy about this.</i>

1053
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:16,350
<i>Gary feels awkward with
this kind of stuff.</i>

1054
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,860
<i>[Practice, practice, practice!]
[Practice makes perfect!]</i>

1055
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,460
<i>I need to practice this part.
I can't make it smooth yet.</i>

1056
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,660
<i>[He summoned his secret acting skill
with 20 years of experience.]</i>

1057
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,660
<i>I didn't even make any mistakes!</i>

1058
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,520
<i>This is confusing!</i>

1059
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,380
[Will Actor Gae be able to
act without any mistakes?]

1060
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,590
[Gary appears.]

1061
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,190
[That's Gary!]

1062
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,630
What the heck is the reason?

1063
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,230
- I've got a cold.
- Won't you shut up?

1064
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,430
[Sad]

1065
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,800
[Awkward]

1066
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,540
Let me ask you one thing,
who's the woman you see every Monday?

1067
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:10,310
Song Ji Hyo...
Song Ji Hyo.

1068
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,590
Do you know Ji Hyo?

1069
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:15,250
Why do you like her so much?

1070
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,350
Why don't you two work together?

1071
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:22,590
[You two... us?]

1072
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,760
[Awkward]

1073
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,060
He's normal.

1074
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,600
Just stop it!

1075
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,400
Can't you do it properly?

1076
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,260
[Properly?]

1077
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,140
[Can you hear my heartbeat?]

1078
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,990
You should shift your position!

1079
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,420
[What?
That wasn't in the script...]

1080
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,190
[He said to shift.]

1081
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:04,190
Please show us!
Please show us!

1082
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,360
[Thanks to the ardent
support of the audience]

1083
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,210
I have hairs on my stomach...

1084
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,770
[Laughing]

1085
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,710
Hey, Kid, can you close
your eyes for a moment?

1086
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,010
I have nothing to show you.

1087
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,860
[Embarrassed]

1088
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,280
He sounds normal, too.

1089
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,660
You dirty bastard!

1090
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,830
[Shocked]
Why would you behave indecently?

1091
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,950
[You told us to...]
We're sorry.

1092
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,320
No, I didn't say that to you.

1093
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,500
I'll examine Mr. Oh Bok Nam first,
and call you after.

1094
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,550
- See you later.
- I'm sorry, Kid.

1095
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,200
[Kang Gary leaves the stage
after his splendid cameo.]

1096
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,030
[Actor Gae, wow!]

1097
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,280
Gary did a good job.

1098
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,370
[Kang Gary, thumbs up!]

1099
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,580
[Gary is waiting for
the next appearance.]

1100
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,080
Are you saying the patient
is more important than me?

1101
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,220
- Lim Ji Hyeon!
- Why are you doing this to me?

1102
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,880
[He's really shocked.]

1103
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,750
Where are you going, Doctor?

1104
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,700
- Does he think I would stay?
- Miss Lim, nurse, Ji Hyeon!

1105
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,100
[Gary appears again!]

1106
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,230
Doctor, I think I'll come back later...

1107
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,700
[For some reason...]

1108
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,100
[I feel shy...]

1109
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,940
I feel strange...

1110
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,610
Let's go get some air together.

1111
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:39,120
[The Awkward Boknam and Gary
happily ended.]

1112
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,190
[Desirable Kang Gary!]

1113
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,550
[Lighthearted]

1114
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,630
Thank you so much!

1115
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,810
You did a fantastic job!

1116
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,990
You guys worked in perfect harmony.

1117
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,320
I liked your ad lib.

1118
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,950
"Hey, Kid, close your eyes."

1119
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,940
My legs are shaking.

1120
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,480
People laughed a lot.

1121
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:11,280
[The Awkward Boknam with Gary,
successfully performed.]

1122
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,250
[The next group is Team PLL's
Hip-kwondo.]

1123
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,490
My name is cheek-bone!

1124
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,830
[The audience is under
these three men's control.]

1125
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,290
There are so many people.

1126
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,200
- Really?
- Did you see the audience?

1127
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,900
- Go take a look.
- Are there a lot?

1128
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,150
- Go take a look.
- No, it'll make him nervous.

1129
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,790
- I think it's better if you stand-by.
- Sure, no problem.

1130
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:39,480
[After the Hip-kwondo, it's Makdoongie.]

1131
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,740
Cheer for me, too!

1132
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,950
Good luck!

1133
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,390
Why are we out of sync all the time?

1134
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,880
[Makdoongie with Jong Kook
team is on standby.]

1135
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:56,160
- Who the heck are you?
- We are Hip-kwondo!

1136
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,920
[Hip-kwondo team leaves the
stage in cheers, too.]

1137
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,030
[Right before they go on stage,
Mr. Capable gets nervous, too.]

1138
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,040
[Running Man team-Makdoongie
with Jong Kook]

1139
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,980
So, the new member Makdoongie
is supposed to come here?

1140
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,510
[Runs]

1141
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,660
Hello!

1142
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,480
I'm Makdoongie!

1143

[Makdoongie is cute.]

1144
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,660
[Nervous]

1145
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,630
[Acting silly]

1146
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:34,410
Aren't you, by any chance,
my first love Hyun Jung?

1147
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:38,520
- You said you became a police officer.
- I'm an undercover officer.

1148
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,460
- Is that why you're disguised as a man?
- Don't look!

1149
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,970
Please, close your eyes
and ears.

Aren't we supposed to
get a new member today?

1152
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,920
That's right.

1153
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,390
I've recruited a very good man.

1154
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:04,160
[Is it my turn to go on stage?]

1155
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,760
You'll be able to tell how good he is.

1156
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,430
Come out, Jong Kook!

1157
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:13,430
[Mr. Capable Kin Jong Kook,
he's heading to the stage.]

1158
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,140
<i>It's not a heavy role,
it's going to be very short.</i>

1159
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,270
<i>[He was already
picked from the beginning.]</i>

1160

<i>[Laugh]</i>

1161
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,610
<i>[The script was written for Kkuk.]</i>

1162

<i>I don't have any funny lines,
but I only have kissing scenes...</i>

1163

[Kkuk's group even practiced
for an action scene.]

1164

[Mr. Capable has been
on stage countless times]

1167
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,270

01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:54,240
[Greetings, I'm the newest
member of Group Ax!]

my first love Hyun Jung?

Jong Kook...

1174
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,030
You said I'm your first love!

1175
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:21,300
I'm sorry, I lied to every men
that I met they're my first love.

1176

Hey, who are you?

1177

[This scene is...]

1179
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,310
[that Jong Kook hit
his chin by mistake.]

[He made a mistake
during the rehearsal.]

1181

[He was able to do it smoothly!]

1186

- Don't do that, Jong Kook!
- Be quiet!

- You be quiet!

[Please stop!]

01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,350
My beard... my beard smudged on you.

1194
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,890
- They really did it.
- They did it?

1195
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:25,690
She was going to draw my beard

1196
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:28,760
but I guess she didn't bring
the pen on purpose.

1197

[While Kkuk is performing,
Ha Ha is getting super nervous.]

her script down until the end.]

You picked the youngest members but...

1202
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,550
Do you need to get beat up
to come to your senses?

1203
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,250
- Young Goo.
- Yes?

1204

What are you doing?

1205
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,520
- You're being unreasonable...
- Are you joking?

01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,450
[Fellow soldiers of
the Laughter War!]

1379
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:43,120
It's time to declare
the result of the poll.

1380
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:49,630
Last week, Team Running Man
won the first part of the race.

1381
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:54,430
We'll sum up the scores of
the first and second round.

1382
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,700
The winners will get a golden mouth.

1383
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:01,640
[A golden mouth
for winning team members!]

1384
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,710
Before that

1385
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:08,620
we'll play a special slide show.

1386
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:12,180
[While they wait for the result,
they'll watch a special slide show.]

1387
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,750
What is it?

1388
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,860
[Curious]

1389
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,500
<i>Tae Hwan, it's me.
[Kim Tae Hwan's Mother]</i>

1390
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,500
[My Mom?]

1391
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:36,210
<i>You're doing a good job,
so keep up the good work</i>

1392
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:41,080
<i>at being a good comedian,
good son and brother.</i>

1393
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,520
<i>Get along well with your colleagues</i>

1394
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:51,220
<i>and be nice to the senior members
and the new members.</i>

1395
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:56,590
<i>You always tell me to stop working</i>

1396
01:15:56,590 --> 01:16:00,300
<i>but I'll work as long as I can.</i>

1397
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,790
<i>So, you be a good comedian</i>

1398
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:11,030
<i>to make people laugh
and also enjoy yourself.</i>

1399
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,350
<i>Cheer up and good luck!</i>

1400
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:16,750
It's Tae Hwan's Mother.

1401
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:21,150
[There's another one!]

1402
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,890
<i>Since you were young...
[Hong Yoon Hwa's Mother]</i>

1403
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:27,960
[Oh, dear!]

1404
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,830
- You look just like your mother.
- She's beautiful.

1405
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:33,750
<i>you always make me laugh.</i>

1406
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:38,720
<i>Now that you grew up
and become a comedian.</i>

1407
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:44,410
<i>It's a somewhat tough
and capacious path.</i>

1408
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:48,860
<i>I see you can handle all sort of things.</i>

1409
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:52,770
<i>And you can make so many
people happy as well.</i>

1410
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:58,170
<i>Also, you're on TV, and
I can see you everyday.</i>

1411
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:00,410
<i>I'm so thankful to you, my daughter.</i>

1412
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:03,230
<i>I hope you stay healthy all the time.</i>

1413
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:11,230
<i>Some people worry that you're big
and you might not be very healthy.</i>

1414
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:15,270
<i>Some of my friends say that to me</i>

1415
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:21,430
<i>but I know you have to eat well, too.
And you exercise, too.</i>

1416
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:25,120
<i>So, I'm not too worried, Sweetheart.</i>

1417
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:29,080
<i>I'm so proud that she lives her life</i>

1418
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,390
<i>with a thankful heart.</i>

1419
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:38,750
[There's another one!]

1420
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,790
<i>Ji Hyeon, it's me.
[Lim Ji Hyeon's Mother]</i>

1421
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,600
<i>I always call you
my princess Ji Hyeon.</i>

1422
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,920
<i>I thought you would stay like a
princess even when you grow up.</i>

1423
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:57,230
<i>But, we became a comedian and
appeared with frown face.</i>

1424
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,520
<i>On one hand, I felt upset and hurt.</i>

1425
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:06,630
<i>But, you said you want
to follow your dream</i>

1426
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:10,020
<i>and I want to cheer for you
by your side</i>

1427
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:17,120
<i>and give you a hug
when you have troubles.</i>

1428
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:23,010
<i>I know it'll be hard, but I hope
you do your best with your life.</i>

1429
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:26,570
<i>Thank you, and I love you, Ji Hyeon!</i>

1430
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,080
[For some people, they're
just a nameless comedian]

1431
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,350
[or an assistant never.]

1432
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,560
[For other, they're
just a funny person.]

1433
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,820
[But we all are...]

1434
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,260
[someone's source of price]

1435
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:53,870
[someone's treasure]

1436
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:59,170
[and someone's precious
son and daughter.]

1437
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,940
Ji Hyeon!

1438
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:07,010
[Huh?
This voice sounds like...]

1439
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:12,420
[Ji Hyeon's Mother appears!]

1440
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:19,060
[Yoon Hwa's Mother and Tae
Hwa's Mother appear!]

1441
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:24,660
[What's going on?]

1442
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:29,390
[But that's not all!]

1443
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:34,030
[The family members of PLL
keep entering the theater.]

1444
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:38,180
[Am I dreaming or what?]
Family members!

1445
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,550
I got goose bumps!

1446
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:43,350
Everyone's parents came!

1447
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,250
[It's the gladness that no one expected,
they laugh and cry at the same time.]

1448
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,890
[I'm right here!]

1449
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,490
- My dad came, too!
- Amazing!

1450
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,630
Look, my mom's there!

1451
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:02,030
[Hug]

1452
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,570
[Don't cry, my daughter.]
It's unbelievable!

1453
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,170
This is amazing!

1454
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,950
[The family member of PLL crews
are gathered at this place.]

1455
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,080
Everyone came.

1456
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,950
You didn't know they're here, right?

1457
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:29,660
They've watched what
you performed today.

1458
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,590
- They were sitting in the audience?
- Yes, they were.

1459
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,560
They were watching the show.

1460
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,370
How come I didn't know that?

1461
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:41,070
Let's greet them now.

1462
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:45,040
Hong Yoon Hwa's mother
[Hong Seon Hwa, Kim Mi Hyun]

1463
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,580
and her sister is here,
but why were you so surprised?

1464
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:53,180
My sister works overseas
and she came home during her break.

1465
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:55,550
But I couldn't see her
because I was busy.

1466
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,850
I was going to see her
after work today

1467
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,790
but she was going to leave today.

1468
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:03,620
- I felt so sorry.
- What happened?

1469
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,890
I was going to leave today

1470
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:09,660
but I delayed my ticket.

1471
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:14,970
They had a seat available for tomorrow.

1472
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,670
So, I'll leave in the morning.

1473
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,840
You watched her performance today,
how was it?

1474
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,880
- She's adorable.
- How about you, Mother?

1475
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,380
Every time I see my daughter,
she looks like a general.

1476
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,850
Who calls their own
daughter a general?

1477
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:35,300
- Who's father are you?
- I'm Lee Eun Hyung's Father.

1478
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,990
[Lee Young Jun]

1479
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,860
[Like father, like daughter]

1480
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,200
Where are Jae Jun's family?

1481
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,600
[Kang Chi Won, Hong Young Ja]
[Kang Jae Jun's parents]

1482
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:50,140
Did you greet each other?
[They met at the dinner today.]

1483
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,570
Yes, I greeted him politely.
[Running Man invited all the families.]

1484
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:58,340
[It became a family meeting
for the future bride and groom.]

1485
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:03,020
What do you think?
They've been dating for seven years.

1486
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,450
If they love each other,
I'm happy for them.

1487
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,350
- Do you think so?
- It's their life.

1488
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:11,720
How about you, Jae Jun's Father?

1489
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,060
I agree with him.

1490
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:17,030
Gun Young performed today,
how was it?

1491
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:23,100
[Jung Gook Ja]
Sometimes, I don't see him on TV.

1492
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,340
When I call him and asks
if he eats his meals

1493
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,570
he says he manages
to stay on pearl barley tea.

1494
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:30,880
[Pearl barley tea?]

1495
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,540
What do you mean by that?

1496
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:36,210
[Shake, shake]
Why pearl barley tea?

1497
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:40,080
I'm not a young kid any more,
when I don't have any money...

1498
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,620
and Mom asks if I'm doing okay.

1499
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:46,420
I feel bad to say that I have no money.

1500
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,930
So, I say I drink pearl barley tea.

1501
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,200
- She sends money?
- It's like a code.

1502
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,870
She asks if I have
pearl barley tea left.

1503
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,670
If I say, I ran out of it...

1504
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,670
It's a secret code
between you and Mother.

1505
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,610
I'm Jae Hun, Jae Hun, Lee Jae Hun's Dad.
[Lee Eung Yeol]

1506
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,240
Do you know his vogue word, too?

1507
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,680
- Of course, I do.
- Could you show us?

1508
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,980
Haha, it's so funny!

1509
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:15,120
[Haha, he's so good!]

1510
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,250
[My dad is the best.]

1511
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:22,030
I'm Oh Bok Nam's Mother.
[Cho Mi Ja]

1512
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,560
[Shy]
Bok Nam, Bok Nam!

1513
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,760
He looks awkward.

1514
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,930
He's "Awkward Bok Nam,"

1515
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:33,800
but he's really nice.

1516
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,770
When I first saw the sketch

1517
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:40,210
I thought it could have been better
if it was "Happy Bok Nam."

1518
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,640
[My Dad is here, too.]

1519
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:46,480
[Kim Sung Gook, Kim Young Koo's Father]
I hope he stays happy.

1520
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,880
Don't just make others laugh

1521
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,020
but also make yourself laugh.

1522
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,860
[Kim Soon Deok]
I'm Kim Won Koo's Mother.

1523
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,200
[He bows deep with so much emotion.]

1524
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:02,730
Good luck, Kim Won Koo!

1525
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,630
[Lee Hwa Yeon]
Hello, I'm Ho Chan's Mom.

1526
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:10,100
- Nice to meet you.
- She has a really nice voice.

1527
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,340
It was hard to stay seated
and watched the show.

1528
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,840
I thought about that it must be tiring

1529
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,780
and nervous while they
wait for their turn.

1530
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:22,320
I'll be nice to him.

1531
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,790
[Choi Hee Sook]
I'm Kang Hyun's Mom.

1532
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:28,390
His mother is really beautiful.

1533
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,260
What happened to you?

1534
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,590
It doesn't make sense!

1535
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:35,300
Don't you feel bad to see his role?

1536
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:40,130
No, I'm proud that he can
compete with Yoo Jae Suk.

1537
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:43,670
[My son is the number one to me!]

1538
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,640
[Lee Hun Young, Lee Hye Ji's Father]
Did you enjoy the show?

1539
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:49,140
There's a place in Nonsan.

1540
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:54,410
Every Sunday, at 8:40 pm.
I go there with 40 friends of mine.

1541
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:58,180
And we raise the viewer ratings for PLL.

1542
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,690
[Just trust me on that one!]

1543
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,490
[Every single words he says is witted.]

1544
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,630
[Choi Kyung Hee, Kim Jung Hwan's Mom]
Hello.

1545
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:13,270
Jung Hwan's Mom.

1546
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:17,060
[Everyone pushes him forward.]
He's wearing skinny jeans today.

1547
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:20,940
Before Jung Hwan became a comedian,
I never watched comedy.

1548
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,440
Did you enjoy the show?

1549
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,750
I feel proud that he seems
he's talented in many different fields.

1550
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:34,480
In the future, I hope he'll be a beloved
and acknowledged comedian and emcee.

1551
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,990
- Thank you.
- Say something, Jung Hwan.

1552
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,350
My mom is being nice to me...

1553
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,460
but I became a comedian
later than everyone else.

1554
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:47,660
There are many young comedians
so their parents are young, too.

1555
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:52,300
It's because I picked my job so late...

1556
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,610
she looks older than everyone else.

1557
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,940
I'm so sorry.

1558
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,110
[Freshen up the atmosphere]
Why didn't you put some more makeup?

1559
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,950
This is the best I could do.

1560
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,350
Thank you so much!

1561
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:09,790
[Thank you for accepting
our invitation!]

1562
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:15,890
We didn't expect it, but we're glad
that you came all the way here

1563
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:20,330
and I'm sure this gives
them really good energy.

1564
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:25,570
Let's give a big round
of applause to cheer!

1565
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,540
[The sons and daughters
cheer for their parents]

1566
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:31,210
[and the parents cheer
for the children.]

1567
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:35,660
Is the result in?

1568
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:40,990
The way I see is that the poll
will decide the winner.

1569
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,950
[The result of the poll will
decide the final winner!]

1570
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:49,480
Out of 255 votes

1571
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,700
the result is...

1572
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,500
Team Running Man vs. Team PLL!

1573
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,770
[The final winner
of the Laughter War!]

1574
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,400
I hope PLL won.

1575
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,840
136 vs. 119,
Team Running Man won!

1576
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:14,280
[Team Running Man is the final winner.]

1577
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,790
[We won!]

1578
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,230
[Congratulations, my son, my daughter!]

1579
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:30,570
They're called as Team Running Man,
but they're actually PLL crews.

1580
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:33,410
We divided team for the game

1581
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,970
but it's actually what PLL members did.

1582
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:39,170
Please give another round of
applause for PLL members!

1583
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:42,080
[Thank you for participating,
"People Looking for a Laughter."]

1584
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:47,480
[Team Running Man gets
the winning prize.]

1585
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,860
[Gold Mouth]
It's for Ji Hyeon.

1586
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,280

1587

01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:16,950
[My colleague's family is my family.
We're all family!]

1592
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:20,050
I always pick someone good,
and your daughter is really good.

1593
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:24,680
Father, please take one.

1594
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,720

[Ha-parrazi on the move!]
[To Gary's house!]

1599

[An unexpected part of Gary's charm?
He knows how to keep a clean house?]

1603

- There's nothing to eat!

1604

Get off, get off, will you?

1605
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,190
<i>You should at least
do the dishes for him.</i>

an actual lock!]
