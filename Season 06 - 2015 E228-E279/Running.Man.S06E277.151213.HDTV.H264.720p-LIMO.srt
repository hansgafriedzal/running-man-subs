<i>That age-old zombie myth

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,090

Semper Fi!

38
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,590
Thank you all for coming here.

39
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,390
- Take your seats.
- Yes, sir!

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,630
Yes!

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,830
I saw him in a drama...

42
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,030
Don't talk about dramas,
he's our Commander.

43
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,070
I'm the director of the security program,
Commander Yeom Dong Heon.

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,690
What is the situation?
Where are the enemies?

45
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,980
As you all know, the Zombie Virus spread
from this secret research laboratory.

46
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,820
- Zombie Virus!
- Zombies!

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,490
We have figured out that there were
approximately 150 employees in the lab.

48
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,760
However, we don't know
how many survived

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,030
and how many have been infected.

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,270
We're in serious trouble.

51
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,100
[They must infiltrate the
mysterious operation area.]

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,670
[Find the survivors that are
hiding in the darkness.]

53
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,490
Our goal is to find all survivors

54
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,010
as well as finding Doctor Yeom,
the head of the lab

55
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,540
to find the solution.

56
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,870
Doctor Yeom?

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,650
Is he related to you?

58
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,690
Are you going to
come back with a mole?

59
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,690
We'll be disappointed
if you wear a wig.

60
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm going to take off my wig!

61
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,190
Are you ready?

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,260
Once you've been bitten, you need to
take the cure within 30 minutes.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,070
Or else, you'll turn into a zombie.

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,470
Unfortunately, the only
cure given to you

65
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,470
is this one.

66
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,270
Then we have to...

67
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,400
You will discuss who will
keep this among you.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,280
The oldest one should take it.
So, me.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,050
No, I'm in the middle.

70
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,250
[Their teamwork
collapsed in front]

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
[of the cure.]

72
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,830
- I can't protect myself!
- You've lived long enough!

73
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,310
Take your dirty hands off of that!

74
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,510
- Take your hands off!
- You guys are strong!

75
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm weak.

76
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,890
- Be quiet!
- You be quiet!

77
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,110
Can I just take it now?

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,010
[He's trying to steal it?]

79
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,080
Is this for motion sickness?

80
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
It's not motion sickness medicine.

81
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,420
We will give a badge

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,490
to whoever rescues
the most survivors.

83
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,290
How much is it worth?

84
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,310
It's a badge, you fool!

85
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,380
[Oh, my Commander!]

86
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,160
[Ahem...]

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,940
Anyway!
The person who receives

88
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,250
the badge will be greatly honored!

89
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,180
I believe in you, soldiers.

90
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,310
I hope you make it back
without being infected.

91
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,780
- Don't worry!
- Dismissed!

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Attention!
Bow!

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,450
- Suk Jin!
- Why are you taking that?

94
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,850
I'll just take it.
You guys are strong.

95
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,600
Someone must be sacrificed here.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,960
In a horror movie,
you'd be sacrificed first.

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
In a horror movie,
Suk Jin would die first.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Jong Kook would be too confident and die
and they would die while in love.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,670
So let's decide
between the three of us.

100
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,490
[I won't betray you with the cure.]

101
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,210
Can't you just say

102
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,450
"here have it"?

103
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,690
What's the point of you
having two lives?

104
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,420
[What did you say?]

105
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,870
[The truth came out.]

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,120
- Be rational!
- Let Jong Kook have it then!

107
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,660
He would be the scariest
if he turned into a zombie.

108
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,400
He would be on the zombies' side.

109
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,740
He would.

110
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,860
You usually save women
and the young ones first.

111
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,670
He might be clumsy
and spill it or something.

112
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,740
You're out, too.

113
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,240
[Giraffe was disqualified thanks to
his carelessness and being unreliable.]

114
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
[Who will keep the cure?]

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,960
I think it would be better
for Ha Ha to drink it.

116
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,850
[Quick witted Ha Ha is perfect for it?]

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,380
I think he would be best for it.

118
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,160
You can steal it
from each other, right?

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,270
He's already focused on thievery.

120
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,720
He's asking if you can steal.

121
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
[All the preparations are complete!]

122
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,940
[The Zombie Virus
that spread in the lab.]

123
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,200
[And the survivors that are
trapped in the lab facility.]

124
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,490
[They don't know how many survivors
there are or where they are!]

125
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,270
[Will Running Man be able
to save all the survivors?]

126
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,780
[Operation No. 9348234]
[Operation Lab Infiltration]

127
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,950
Please tell us
if something happens.

128
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,220
Stay focused even if
you turn into a zombie!

129
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,090
I got it!

130
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,380
Think about our memories and stuff.

131
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,670
We'll let you know
if anything happens.

132
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,690
- Let's go.
- Don't betray.

133
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,870
[Running Man Special Investigations,
Operation: Area Scout.]

134
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,270
Let's do our best until the end.

135
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,240
We'll rescue the survivors.

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,620
- Let's bring back as many as we can.
- Okay.

137
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,960
If you rescue them,
I'll bring them over.

138
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,450
What?

139
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,050
Let's not do that.

140
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,340
[Foggy view...]

141
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,600
[A dreary atmosphere.]
This building must be abandoned.

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
What's going on?

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,050
[How is it inside?]

144
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,710
It's scary.

145
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,740
[And there is...]

146
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,080
[And there is no one...]

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,380
[And there is no one to be seen.]

148
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,560
- It's spooky.
- It is.

149
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,110
We can't split up.

150
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,490
We need to stick together.

151
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,980
There are newspapers.

152
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,030
It's cold in here.

153
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,030
I know.

154
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,890
Did they make it colder on purpose?

155
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,820
We need to search all
the rooms one by one.

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,200
[The firmly shut doors...]

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,000
[There might be survivors.]

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,470
If we get bitten by the zombies...

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,290
Wouldn't there be
survivors in there?

160
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,820
The door's open.
[Agent Kim Jong Kook.]

161
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,180
Let's go see.

162
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,970
[The door is half open.]

163
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,900
I feel like a survivor
would be in there.

164
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,340
[Who left this behind?]

165
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,670
If you open if like that we might
bump into it while we run away.

166
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,160
Why are you so picky?

167
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't think there are any zombies.

168
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,520
I heard something!

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,160

I don't think there are any zombies.

173

No one's here.

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,940
Right?

175
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,110
- Let's go down.
- There are people there.

[Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin,
Song Ji Hyo are deployed.]

178
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,800
I don't know what it is, but it's scary.

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,290
What happens if we get bit?

180
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,540
We need to save survivors, right?

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,220
Survivors!

182
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,530
Are there any survivors out there?

183
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,510
Doctor Yeom!

184
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,740
[The hallway's silent.]

185
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,610
Are there any survivors?

186
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,450
There aren't any here.

187
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,540
This is before something
big happened.

188
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,550
[Right before a storm.]

189
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,160
[Where are the survivors...]

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,990
[They]

191
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:11,270
[might be coming for us.]

192
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,450
[Agent Kim Jong Kook
and Lee Kwang Soo]

193
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,110
[are entering basement level one.]

194
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,820
[Thud!]
Why are you so loud!

195
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,580
It's so dark!

196
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,070
I think there will be survivors...

197
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,710
I don't think there
are zombies here.

198
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,850
There are zombies!

199
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,570
- What do we do?
- There are a bunch.

200
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,600
There are too many.

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,140
[What is the true nature
of the zombies?]

202
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,940
There are way too many!

203
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,850
[In the dark...]

204
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,820
[In the dark,
the zombies finally started to move.]

205
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,490
Do we just need to run quickly?

206
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,800
- I don't think they're fast.
- Right?

207
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,760
[They're entering the zombie
concentration zone.]

208
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,890
There are so many!

209
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,770
They aren't attacking us?

210
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,600
It's no joke!

211
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,140
It's so intense!

212
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,760
Let's go that way.

213
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,310
How?

214
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,510
Let's go to the machinery room.

215
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,420
Let's go this way.

216
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,200
Shouldn't we look at all of this?

217
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,830
Survivors...

218
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,560
Are you there?
Survivors?

219
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,940
They're not here.

220
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,110
Kwang Soo!

221
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,680
[Oh my god!]

222
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,050
[The zombies appeared!]

223
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,600
I'll actually hit you!

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,090
[Rational thinking went out the window
when the zombie showed up.]

225
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,030
[Oh my god]

226
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,100
[They recompose themselves
after their zombie encounter.

227
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,980
How do we go in?
There's so many of them!

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,360
Do we just have to run?

229
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,490
[How do you expect us to go in there!]

230
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,710
Maybe we just don't
need to get caught.

231
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,660
[Agents Yoo Jae Suk,
Ji Suk Jin, and Song Ji Hyo]

232
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,090
You're really scared, aren't you?

233
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,510
I'm so...

234
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,160
I can't even look at zombies.

235
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,770
The basement...

236
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,780
This building has up to
five basement levels.

237
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,700
I see zombies.

238
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,510
There's are zombies over there.

239
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,340
There are actual zombies!

240
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,710
There really are zombies!

241
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,010
Zombies...

242
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,220
Oh my god!

243
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
[What was that sound?]

244
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,910
You stepped on it!

245
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,180
Are you going to do this again!

246
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,090
- It was him?
- He stepped on it!

247
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,490
Don't be scared and run away!

248
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,960
Gwon Yeol...

249
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,840
[Zombie Cave: take two.]

250
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,910
[Pale]

251
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,960
[He takes a step back.]

252
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,210
There are more in there!

253
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,760
There are too many!

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,290
Wait a minute.

255
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,780
Wait, we're not supposed to run away.

256
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,840
Wait.

257
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,870
What's wrong?

258
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,160
[They ran into Gary and Ha Ha.]

259
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,730
- There are way too many.
- Really?

260
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,760
We can't even go in.

261
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,940
Do you know the
zombies' characteristics?

262
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,560
What do they look like?

263
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,070
You know the zombies in movies?

264
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,050
[The memory they can't get rid of
after looking at the zombies.]

265
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,270
- Can we get the zombies out?
- We don't know.

266
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,220
- Do they have name tags?
- Yeah they do.

267
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,520
- Maybe we eliminate them.
- We should try it.

268
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,600
- Let's try it.
- Should we?

269
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,870
[The zombies' labels on their backs.]

270
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,960
[This is the zombies' weakness?]

271
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,070
[Agent Jae Suk starts his
investigation on level two.]

272
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,340
There's more over there!

273
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,750
It's so realistic.
It's too scary.

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,890
[Are there really survivors here?]

275
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,860
[Blank Ji also enters level two.]

276
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,160
We need to find survivors.

277
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,820
They're over there.

278
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,970
[Why is there a door knob?]

279
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,040
[There's a secret room!]

280
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,960
[Who is here?]

281
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,470
<i>Our goal is to find all survivors</i>

282
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,280
<i>as well as finding Doctor Yeom,
the head of the lab</i>

283
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,780
<i>to find the solution.</i>

284
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,250
<i>Doctor Yeom?</i>

285
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>Is he related to you?</i>

286
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,990
[Doctor Yeom, whom we have to rescue]

287
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,360
[is right here...]

288
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
[Doctor Yeom,
biotechnology expert.]

289
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,500
[He cut off all contact while
revealing truth about zombies.]

290
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,890
Doctor!

291
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,910
[Agents Grasshopper and
Blank Ji found the Doctor.]

292
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,090
Doctor!
What happened?

293
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,620
[What on earth happened?]

294
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,200
You've come a long way.

295
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
However, it's too late.

296
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,360
I've already been infected.

297
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,090
Wow, I'm so into this.

298
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,780
What do we do, Doctor?

299
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,980
How can we save the people?

300
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,560
How did you come all the way here?

301
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,000
I've done countless
experiments for

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,420
the extension of life.

303
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,540
And in one, there was a
modification in the DNA.

304
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,800
It developed into the Zombie Virus.

305
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,070
I was able to discover a few clues
thanks to my research.

306
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,950
[What are the clues
to get rid of the zombies?]

307
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,430
[Shake, shake]

308
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,870
I've found a few facts.

309
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,090
They have atrophied eyes.

310
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,540
They don't react to light.

311
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
They react to big sounds.

312
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,910
Lure them with sound.

313
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,200
With sound.

314
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,110
[Crash]

315
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,310
It's one hundred percent.

316
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,200
They're moving to the sound.

317
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,890
They can't see.

318
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,100
[But as soon as they are detected
by sound, they're in danger.]

319
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,980
And the second clue.

320
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,760
If you eliminate the
name tag on their back...

321
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,740
[Rip]

322
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,450
They die!

323
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,400
[Did they find the way
to kill the zombies?]

324
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
- Oh, so we do this.
- Let's eliminate!

325
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,890
If you eliminate the
name tag on their back

326
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,200
they'll faint for a
short amount of time!

327
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,050
It's only for a while!

328
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,940
And like me, if you get bitten
you'll be infected right away.

329
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,850
If you don't drink the
cure within 30 minutes

330
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,000
then you'll become a zombie.

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,850
We only have one cure.

332
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,560
There are cures hidden
throughout the building.

333
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,450
You must find them
and save the people.

334
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,760
[And!]

335
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,090
This is all of my research.

336
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,710
Please use this and
save the people.

337
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,780
[Take Dr. Yeom's research notes
and give it to the Commander.]

338
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,540
Argh!

339
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,970
[The transformation has begun.]

340
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,180
The Doctor is changing!
Let's go!

341
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,610
[Please save the people for me!]

342
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:10,610
[What kind of clues are
in the research notes?]

343
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,540
Jae Suk!

344
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,400
They're calm again.

345
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,670
There are so many!

346
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't talk!

347
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,090
They're turning around.

348
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,770
I don't think we should make noise.

349
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,140
They turned around when you talked.

350
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,070
[Mr. Capable found out one
of their characteristics.]

351
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,710
There's a laptop with an R sticker.

352
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,720
Ahh!

353
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,020
[Scream!]

354
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,250
[This is big trouble if you scream!]

355
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,900
[The zombies are heading
to where Mr. Capable is.]

356
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,230
[He got away with his strength.]

357
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,070
[You betrayed me in front
of the zombies?]

358
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,200
[An eye for an eye,
a zombie for a zombie.]

359
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,470
[He's about to unleash
the zombie in the storage.]

360
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,140
Please listen to me.

361
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,000
Ahh!

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
[It's already our second encounter.]

363
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,090
She went back in!

364
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,980
Really?

365
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,690
Do they really react to sound?

366
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,650
They all turn around
when you scream!

367
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,420
Seriously... don't do that again!

368
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,250
Okay, I'm convinced now, thanks.

369
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,820
[They go back into the zombie
cave to retrieve the laptop.]

370
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,480
[Giraffe is leading the way
to atone for his actions.]

371
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,220
Ahh!

372
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,290
[Ahh!]

373
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,670
[Mr. Capable's counterattack.]

374
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,760
[Have a great time with
the zombies, Kwang Soo!]

375
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,500
[Thud, thud]

376
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,420
[The zombies moved
toward the door.]

377
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,570
[I can't let them hear me breathe!]

378
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,160
[He retrieved the laptop.]

379
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,470
[He escaped the zombie cave.]

380
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,590
They react to sound!

381
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm done with Jong Kook.

382
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,860
I got everything
I need from Jong Kook.

383
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,820
[What's the clue left in the laptop?]

384
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,830
Observation summary!

385
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,620
"Observation summary.
Experiment number 45."

386
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,070
"They don't feel pain."

387
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,890
"What is the difference
between dead bodies..."

388
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,140
I was scared,
but not anymore.

389
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,420
I found out that they react to sound.

390
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,390
Everyone, you can escape a crisis

391
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,350
if you are calm like me,
in any situation.

392
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,020
[Zombies' characteristics]

393
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,000
[They react to sound.]

394
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,940
[The can't feel pain.]

395
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,700
[You must drink the cure within
30 minutes if you've been bitten.]

396
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,800
There are so many...

397
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,240
They're so scary!

398
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,020
Be quiet!

399
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,050
They're there!

400
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,690
There must be a clue.

401
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,020
What?

402
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:41,710
[Did he see a survivor or a clue?]

403
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,530
Is that a zombie?

404
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,510
[A questionable
zombie is collapsed.]

405
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,340
Go in!

406
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,070
- Why is it lying down?
- Go in.

407
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,440
[I said go in!]

408
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,070
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

409
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,360
[He found a clue.]

410
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,520
[A clue beside the zombie.]

411
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,270
"Observation date, summary.
Experiment Day 30."

412
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,560
"It still can't talk."

413
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,670
"It can't learn any of the words,
but only makes weird noises."

414
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,760
"It's more like an animal
than a human."

415
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,940
"It only moans without
any specific symptoms."

416
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,380
"All other subjects are the same.
No matter what medication is used..."

417
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,130
They did experiments on them...

418
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,450
"To obtain emergency food supply"

419
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,160
"go near the basketball court."

420
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,290
[They need a food cache
to fight the zombies all day!]

421
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,050
- That scared me!
- It's so creepy!

422
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,800
Why are they so good at acting?

423
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,820
That's incredible!

[Armory storage]

425
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,980
There must be weapons...

426
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,270
What is it?

427
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,760
What is this?

428
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
[Why are there neck warmers?]

429
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,600
It must be like a talisman.

430
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,670
Should we try
putting it on their neck?

431
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,940
Wasn't she wearing
something on her neck...

432
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,890
This is it!
Zombies die if we put this one them!

433
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
If we put this on their necks...

434
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,310
[They found the weapon that]

435
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,960
[could get rid of the zombies!]

436
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,310
Now, we have to be quiet.

437
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:21,310

that can get rid of them completely.]

survivors in basement level five.]

Is there anyone alive?

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,710
Are there any survivors?

443
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,420
[They search the hallway.]
Survivor?

444
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,140
[Surprised]

445
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,560
I think they would be in here.

446
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,740
That's really scary!

447
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,580
[Is that a zombie or a person?]

448
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,530
Are you a survivor?

449
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,300
Are you sure?

450
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,870
- Turn around.
- We found a survivor.

451
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,360

the survivor out to safety!]

brings the survivor out to safety.]

- What?
- Yeah, I came in first.

Zombies let us walk around.

523

As time goes by, they might be faster.
Or get scarier in certain conditions.

Before it happens,
we need to solve the problem.

I think there are
scarier zombies inside.

526
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,470
Strong zombies will appear.

527

If something worse happens,
we have no ways to survive.

We found a computer file earlier.

529
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,210
It says they become smarter and smarter.

530
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,870
They're going to be smarter
as time goes by.

<i>They can't feel the pain.</i>

535
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,470
<i>They couldn't talk before,
but...</i>

536
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,420
<i>I found out the same thing.</i>

537
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,200
<i>After a certain time,
they can talk.</i>

538
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,100
<i>That was number 88.
They'll have the ability to talk.</i>

539
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,940
What's that?

540
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,260
[Jong Kook, Gary, Ha Ha and
Kwang Soo found Dr. Yeom's office.]

541
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,610
- Doctor Yeom!
- What are you doing here?

542
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,270
How's the situation?

543
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,160
I've met your twin brother.

544
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,090
Thank you for finding me,
but it's too late.

545
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,420
I'm already infected.

546
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,250
What about the cure?

547
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,850
Are you a zombie?

548
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,780
Trap the doctor!

549
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,160
Give him the cure!

550
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,270
We need to save the doctor.

551
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,620
I drank it already.

552
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,090
We need to save him.

553
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,740
It's too late for me.
You'd better leave here!

554
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,810
Doctor Yeom, promise me
you won't bite us.

555
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,670
In the movie, the doctor
usually asks to be killed.

556
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,290
I want to live.

557
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,180
He's very honest.

558
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,960
[This is reality.]

559
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,670
- Maybe it's better than turning...
- Just go!

560
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,940
[Do you know how hard
to act like a zombie?]

561
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,340
Stock up on some sugar.

562
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,690
[Scream]

563
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,890
You scared me to death!

564
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,710
[A zombie appears in the lab.]

565
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,380
[They can break into the lab now!]

566
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,340
[They didn't act like this before!]

567
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,620
[Their attacking skill and
the speed are upgraded.]

568
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,800
What happened?

569
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,820
[You need to escape!]

570
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,290
Look at him!

571
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,530
- Kwang Soo!
- Why is he so fast?

572
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,220
[Even the doctor?]
Kwang Soo, please!

573
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,470
Kwang Soo!

574
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,750
[Agent Ha Ha is infected
with the Zombie Virus.]

575
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,990
Did he bite you?

576
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:30,490
[If Ha Ha doesn't drink the cure,
he will become a zombie!]

577
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,600
How can they all leave without me?

578
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,800
They're really fast!

579
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,780
The zombies are a lot faster now.

580
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,420
Antidote!
Take the cure from Ha Ha!

581
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,740
Kwang Soo, take the cure!

582
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,350
Suddenly, they move so fast!

583
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,590
[Of course, he's trying
to drink the cure.]

584
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,020
[No, that's the only cure we have!]

585
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,070
Take it from him!

586
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,170
Antidote!

587
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,270
[We need to stop
him in case of emergency!]

588
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,710
[Will he drink, or will they stop him?]

589
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't let him drink!
Quickly!

590
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,770
It's so delicious.

591
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,270
[He drank it in one gulp.]
Did he finish it?

592
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,140
I drank it all.

593
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,450
[Ha Ha was the wrong choice.]

594
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,650
How can you all run away without me?

595
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,720
We should've taken it from him earlier.

596
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,060
- We're done for if they bite us.
- Did he drink it?

597
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,050
[They lost their safety device.]

598
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,930
- They bit me, so I drank it.
- Why did we give it to him?

599
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,300
What are you doing in
front of a dying person?

600
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,560
They're so fast now, I couldn't
draw their attention with sound.

601
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,470
Doctor Yeom.

602
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,910
[How come you didn't give it to me?]
Look at his eyes, let's get out!

603
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:03,680
[Starting now, the zombies'
counterattack begins!]

604
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,560
[Currently, the zombies are evolving.]

605
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,690
[Speed up]

606
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,820
[The counterattack of
the running zombies]

607
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,670
They're so fast.

608
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,240
They're too fast.

609
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,820
- What do we do?
- It's over.

610
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,440
We're done!

611
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,310
[Will they be able to save the
survivors from the evolved zombies?]

612
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,400
[The zombies have finished
the second transition.]

613
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,310
[Something's different?]

614
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,760
[The zombies are noticeably faster.]

615
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,460
[They're working in
a worse situation now.]

616
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,920
- Huh?
- What now?

617
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,340
[He found a laptop
with an experiment log.]

618
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,810
Zombie Observation Journal no. 76!

619
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,840
First, they were only walking.
Now, they can run like humans.

620
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,980
We're in trouble!

621
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,810
They even talk?

622
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,420
[The zombies can run?]

623
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,950
[The zombies are becoming
stronger and stronger.]

624
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,580
[They're searching for the survivors
and cure in a hurry.]

625
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,450
They really run!

626
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,910
[And they're fast!]

627
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,070
Run, run!

628
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,760
[Terrified]

629
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,610
Run, run!

630
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,740
They can't climb up the stairs.

631
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,320
[The only safe zone is the stairs.]

632
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,890
They run.

633
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,400
Suk Jin, the zombies can run now.

634
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,290
- Did you see them running?
- Yes, we just saw.

635
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,940
[Like the journal says,
the zombies started to evolve.]

636
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,340
It's getting worse.

637
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,800
[It's going to be harder
to save the survivors.]

638
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,030
[At the same time, they're more active.]
There are so many of them.

639
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,560
Why so many?

640
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,940
[Agent Jong Kook is searching for
survivors on the second floor.]

641
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,480
[There's no way out.]

642
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,750
[Could there be anyone in here?]

643
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,720
[A survivor!]

644
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,760
[A zombie senses his presence,
and approaches.]

645
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,850
[Rip]

646
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,110
[Mr. Capable rips the zombie's
name tag mercilessly.]

647
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,450
[After attacking one, another
zombie attacks him.]

648
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,510
[Struggle, struggle]

649
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,820
[How come it doesn't open?]

650
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,950
Come over here!

651
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,560
[I don't want to.]

652
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,720
Bring it on, Zombie!

653
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,930
[Please save me!]

654
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,700
[He eliminates his name
tag with his strength.]

655
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,200
[This might be better.]

656
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,070
[While the zombies are out,
he escapes with the survivor.]

657
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,040
Let's hurry.

658
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,010
- Thank you.
- No problem.

659
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,690
I didn't know you were in there.

660
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,720
[Two zombies couldn't stop Agent Kkuk,
and he saves two survivors.]

661
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,720
[Agent Giraffe searches harder.]

662
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,300
[Sneaky walk]

663
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,820
[Agent Giraffe goes in deep.]

664
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,980
What?

665
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,090
[He found the cure!]

666
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
[Knock, knock]

667
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,090
Someone just knocked!

668
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,270
[Knock, knock]

669
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,800
Where is it from?

670
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,370
[Someone's near here!]

671
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,540
Where is it?

672
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,200
[A survivor successfully
signaled for rescue.]

673
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,270
[But, he could also be
a target of zombies.]

674
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,820
[It's full of zombies on the way out.]

675
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,320
[Both of them passed
the zombies safely.]

676
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,530
Why am I such a good finder today?

677
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,190
Are you okay?

678
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,660
Just trust me!

679
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,030
There's a survivor.
Are you a survivor?

680
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,530
[The found a survivor
hiding behind a pole.]

681
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,600
[They carefully checks to
see if he's infected.]

682
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,110
- A survivor?
- Another one?

683
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,940
There are a lot of survivors.

684
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,180
Search for more.
I'll escort him.

685
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,220
Suk Jin, why don't you search?
I need to escort him.

686
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,580
[Bickering]

687
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,140
[Of course, a zombie heard them.]

688
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,990
[Run to the stairs!]

689
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,960
[Here's another one.]
Run!

690
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,770
[There's another one.]

691
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,570
Quickly!
[Running at full speed]

692
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,400
There's a zombie!

693
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,240
It's not even funny!

694
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,150
[It's hard to find the exit because
the building is like a maze.]

695
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Wait a moment!

696
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,720
[There's the exit!]

697
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,330
- Aren't they really scary?
- Yes.

698
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,570
[A group of zombies are
chasing after them.]

699
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,020
[The ultimate weapon, neck warmer!]

700
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,850
[He couldn't put it on him!]

701
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,190
[In a hurry, they run
toward the stairs.]

702
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,800
- Suk Jin...
- I tried to put it, but failed.

703
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,170
I can't go to the lower floor.

704
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,100
They can't climb up the stairs.

705
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,200
[It's too much.]

706
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,580
- The zombies are faster now.
- They're really fast!

707
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Did you find any?

708
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,380
[What did I find?]
Kwang Soo?

709
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,080
You delete all the files

710
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,620
and rip all the journals
everywhere you go.

711
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,420
Are you really going to play like this?

712
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,890
Should we infect him?

713
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,960
- We might...
- I won't do it any more.

714
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,230
Don't we need to see what
happens, if we're bitten?

715
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,400
- How can you say that to me?
- Think about what you did.

716
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,240
Make one mistake, and you
won't ever be forgiven!

717
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,140
We're a team, you know!

718
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,980
Are you kidding?

719
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,340
I don't trust you.

720
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,310
I guess the survivors
must be scared, too.

721
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,480
They run so fast, when zombies approach!

722
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,350
The survivors act like zombies.

723
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,890
It's hard to tell who's zombie
and who's survivor.

724
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,670
The zombies are evolving.

725
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,870
Where did Suk Jin go?

726
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,830
Since he's not here...

727
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,690
Not yet.

728
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,820
[Agent Big Nose and Ji Hyo are trapped.]
We need to eliminate their name tag.

729
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,960
And make them faint for a moment.

730
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,180
He's coming.

731
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,380
[Tap, tap, tap]
Rip it now!

732
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,790
[While Ji Hyo lures him with sound,
Big Nose ripped his name tag.]

733
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,290
Run!

734
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,160
[And they escape while he passes out.]

735
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,900
- Is there a way out?
- Yes.

736
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,430
[Stomp, stomp]

737
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,220
[Imminent situation]

738
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,170
Suk Jin, hurry up!

739
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,340
[She lets Agent Big Nose escape.]

740
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,600
[And saves the survivor!]

741
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,450
[Thank you, Ji Hyo!]

742
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,780
[Agent Big Nose safely
enters to the stairs.]

743
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,360
I barely escaped.

744
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,020
[It feels like they survived
in the battlefield.]

745
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,250
With all the running,
it's pretty tiring.

746
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,000
[Agent Song Ji Hyo finally
saves a survivor!]

747
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,200
[Gary found a survivor on
basement level two.]

748
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,360
When I count to three, we'll
run behind the zombie.

749
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,740
Catch it!

750
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,670
[He drew the zombie's
attention with a stick]

751
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,600
[and rushes to the stairs.]

752
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,090
It's okay!
[Plop]

753
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,340
[Her legs gave way
with all the tension.]

754
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,340
[Noisy]

755
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,190
- Gary?
- Did you save her?

756
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,620
Gary, let me escort her.

757
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,870
I'll escort her.
[Everyone wants to get a point.]

758
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,600
I'll carry her on my back.

759
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,580
Wait, Kyung Hee!

760
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,740
- Kyung Hee...
- She's Suk Hee.

761
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,960
- Jae Suk, Kyung Hee's over there!
- Where?

762
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,740
- Kyung Hee's coming.
- She's infected!

763
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,580
In the lower level...
there are a lot of survivors.

764
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,420
[There are many survivors to rescue!]

765
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,590
[We'll be on our way...]
Where?

766
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,690
[The zombie's rush!]

767
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,930
[Gary's caught!]

768
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,640
[They leave Gary alone and run away.]

769
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,640
[Even though it's an emergency,
I must protect the survivor!]

770
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,910
[Scream]
He's bitten!

771
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,790
[Help me...]

772
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,250
[Big-nosed Brother stole the survivor.]

773
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,350
Gary's bitten.

774
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,520
I brought her.

775
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,660
- Gary saved her!
- Where's Gary?

776
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,330
[Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, Suk Jin saved two,
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo saved one.]

777
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,400
[Scared to death]

778
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,570
It was really scary.

779
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,470
I need to eat something.

780
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,170
[The zombies are evolving quickly!]

781
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,240
I didn't think they'd be that fast.

782
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
[Faster than we thought!]

783
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,510
Was Gary bitten?

784
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,680
I think so.

785
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,550
I'm 100 percent sure he's bitten.

786
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,190
If he can't find the cure,
he's done for.

787
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,690
That's right.
We need to find the cure, too.

788
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,220
We should.

789
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,300
Where is the survivor?

790
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,900
Where did she go?

791
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,530
[Agent Giraffe arrives to
the crime scene a tad late.]

792
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,960
- Were you bitten?
- I wasn't.

793
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,570
- You dirty zombie!
- Come back!

794
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,710
[I'm not a zombie yet!]

795
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,940
I'm going bite you before
I turn into a zombie!

796
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,480
Where is the survivor you rescued?

797
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,980
I got bit and you're not
worried about me at all?

798
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,060
[Should I have expected otherwise?]

799
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,560
[I'll just go search for the cure.]

800
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,560
- I need to find the cure.
- Where is the survivor?

801
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,060
My life is over, so don't talk to me.

802
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,530
[There's no time to lose.]

803
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,740
[If he can't find it within 30 minutes,
he's going to the zombie world.]

804
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,710
Look at me, I got bit.
We're friends now.

805
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,210
[Gary is walking around
the zombies casually.]

806
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,780
[Searching]

807
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,350
I'll bring them here when I
become a zombie later.

808
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,290
I'm in trouble!

809
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,710
[He's in a hurry, but
this building is huge.]

810
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,260
[There's no clue or someone
who can help him.]

811
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:03,240
[Will Agent Gary be able to find the
cure and cure the Zombie Virus?]

812
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,240
[The agents are scared after
Gary's been infected.]

813
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,510
You've been bitten.

814
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,350
What are you talking about?
[Kwang Soo looks suspicious as usual.]

815
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,920
Why did you walk away
when you saw us before?

816
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,160
Gary!

817
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,340
I'm in a hurry!

818
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,330
I'm so sorry!

819
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,030
Call me if you find the cure!

820
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm sorry, but I'll be in a meeting.

821
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,970
[I'm sorry, Gary.
I found the cure.]

822
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,740
[Air of innocence.]

823
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,490
- You didn't get bitten?
- No, I didn't.

824
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,940
He must have drank the cure
even if he was bitten.

825
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,940
But we don't have the cure.

826
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,450
He probably found one
already and drank it.

827
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,820
- Where did you hide it?
- I didn't find one.

828
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,650
Let me see.

829
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,630
[Will they find the
cure he's hiding?]

830
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,450
Do I have to get treated
like this every time?

831
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,000
[Rummaging]

832
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:13,540
[Phew... they didn't find it.]

833
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,370
Let's go.
Let's make them faint!

834
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,780
Make who faint?

835
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,070
The zombies, one by one.

836
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,820
We can rip their name tags.

837
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,680
[Basement level one]

838
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,800
[Agent Big nose is leading the troop.]

839
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,620
[To draw their attention,
he grabs a stick.]

840
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,740
[At the moment he was about to get in]

841
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,900
Big Nose!
[Huh?]

842
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,130
[Did the zombie just talk?]

843
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,810
[Slam]
[The door shut.]

844
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,010
[You were greedy for points,
have a taste of this!]

845
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,080
[Thud, thud!]

846
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,650
[Scream]

847
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,000
[What comes around goes around.]
Isn't that too harsh?

848
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,300
[He was betrayed by his colleagues.]

849
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,370
[And attacked by the zombies.]

850
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:23,540
They talk now!

851
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,750
[Hooray!]

852
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,390
[Agent Ji Suk Jin is infected
by the Zombie Virus.]

853
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,030
[The cruel end of their betrayal.]

854
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,830
It's Suk Jin!

855
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,130
It's all because of them.

856
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,130
- Did Suk Jin...
- He's bitten.

857
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,540
Kim Jong Kook shut the door.

858
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,740
- Seriously.
- Hurry up and find the cure.

859
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,480
Are you my colleagues?

860
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,050
Why did you keep stealing
the survivors, then?

861
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,650
He's bitten!

862
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,780
I brought a really important
piece of information.

863
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,420
What information?

864
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,890
A zombie talked to me.

865
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,560
What did he say?

866
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,860
He saw me and said,
"Big Nose!"

867
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,300
[Did the zombie really speak?]

868
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,300
[On many observation journals]

869
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,870
[they found the fact about the
zombies' ability to evolve.]

870
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,340
I'm serious!

871
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:39,040
[The zombies have evolved again!]

872
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,480
[Big Nose has to find the
cure in 30 minutes.]

873
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,320
Friends, it's me!
See?

874
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,720
- I've bitten.
- Big Nose!

875
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,290
Yes, I'm Big Nose.

876
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,420
Nice to meet you!

877
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,020
[It's just one word, but they do speak!]
Friends!

878
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:57,160
- Big Nose!
- Big Nose!

879
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,630
[He doesn't have much time, but he
gathers zombies and plays captain.]

880
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,540
Friends, do you know
where the cure is?

881
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,910
Big Nose!
[They can't make a sentence yet.]

882
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,850
Do you know where the cure is?

883
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:18,220
[Agent Gary has less than 10 minutes.]

884
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,490
[I hope it's here...]

885
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,060
[What?]

886
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,130
[He found it!]

887
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,530
[Agent Gary barely avoided
turning into a zombie.]

888
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,640
How do we know when he
turns into a zombie?

889
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,810
He's coming here.

890
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,040
Gary!

891
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,780
Do you feel any changes?

892
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,580
I found the cure.

893
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,350
Hurry up and drink,
and don't tell people.

894
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,300
[He's cured.]
Gary!

895
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,470
I'm your friend, Gary.

896
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,510
[I'm sorry, Suk Jin... I survived.]

897
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,710
[Basement level three]

898
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,050
[Agent Giraffe is searching
for survivors alone.]

899
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,950
[Since he has the cure,
he's walking between zombies.]

900
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,960
Are you a survivor?

901
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,800
[He walks faster than anyone else,
so he finds more survivors, too.]

902
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,300
[He shares his emergency food.]

903
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,610
[He's rescued three people so far.]

904
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,810
[In a moment...]

905
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,250
[He finds another survivor.]

906
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:17,530
[He rescues her safely while
surrounded by the zombies.]

907
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,370
[Basement level two]

908
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,340
- Are you a survivor?
- Yes.

909
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,140
There's no zombie here, right?

910
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,980
It's okay to bet bitten by a zombie,
but don't go to other agents.

911
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,620
- Are you bitten?
- What are you talking about?

912
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,190
- Aren't you bitten by a zombie?
- No, I'm not.

913
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:43,260
[He was too busy rescuing survivors,
so he doesn't know what happened.]

914
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,060
[Where could the cure be?]

915
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,330
[Another survivor?]

916
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,540
Let me take him to the aid station.

917
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,270
[Is he still trying to
steal the survivor?]

918
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,600
[Avoiding Big-nosed Brother,
he's leaving the building in a hurry]

919
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,050
- Did you find the cure?
- Kwang Soo.

920
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,720
Where do you find all the survivors?

921
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,320
Gary!

922
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,380
[While everyone wants
to steal the survivors]

923
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,830
[Kwang Soo saved six people.]
Justice prevails!

924
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,540
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

925
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,800
Don't worry, I'll save the planet!

926
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,710
[Yes, you can save the planet.]

927
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,220
[and Big Nose has to find the cure.]

928
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,580
Antidote, where is it?

929
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,790
[His body starts acting up.]

930
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,930
No, I need the cure!
I can't die like this!

931
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,730
Please!

932
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,370
Please, I don't want to be a zombie!

933
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,170
It's weird...
My body feels weird.

934
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,670
No, no!

935
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,090
[Chills...
His acting is brilliant!]

936
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:35,360
[Stay tuned!]
[Big Nose is zombie-fied!]

937
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,650
[What's the sound?]

938
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,140
What is it?

939
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,810
[Big Nose zombie]

940
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,640
[Scared to death]

941
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:53,210
[From the looks to the way he talks,
he's completely turned to a zombie!]

942
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,820
We're in trouble!

943
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,560
[Like old friend like zombies.]

944
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,760
[Big Nose has changed..]

945
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,160
Big Nose!
Big Nose!

946
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,240
- Big Nose!
- Big Nose!

947
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,970
[Everybody say "Big Nose!"]

948
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,810
Bite... all!

949
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,680
[Big Nose's method acting]

950
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,810
[And Giraffe watches
him from a distance.]

951
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,310
[Laugh]

952
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,720
[This is too embarrassing!]

953
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,420
[He laughs without a sound.]

954
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,590
[He approaches without a sound]

955
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:43,000
[and records him in the face of danger.]

956
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,830
[It's an exclusive!]

957
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:49,840
[Look at this!]
Big Nose!

958
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:56,040
[Laugh]

959
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,380
[What a surprise!
That's how I look?]

960
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,780
[Shh... look at Suk Jin.]

961
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,310
[Peek-a-boo!]

962
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,740
[It's awkward for both of them.]

963
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,860
It's awkward for me, too...

964
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,900
[He's too awkward, he had to
express it to his old colleagues.]

965
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,530
- Hurry up and look.
- Is there anything fun to watch?

966
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,170
- Yes.
- Grasshopper!

967
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,840
[Everyone's laughing.]

968
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,560
[That's too funny!]

969
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,950
Why are you laughing?

970
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,810
[It's funny for me, too.]
Why are you laughing?

971
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,750
That could've been me
if I didn't find the cure.

972
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,250
[Wait until you're infected,
I'll laugh at you so hard.]

973
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,360
[This is tiring...
but I must act!]

974
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,560
Grasshopper...

975
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,310
What's that?

976
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,470
[Agent Ha Ha found a survivor
while everyone's laughing at him.]

977
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,730
Let me escort her.

978
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,300
I found a critical hint.

979
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,570
I found only two so far.

980
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,890
- I saved... six.
- You saved six people?

981
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,250
Kwang Soo rescued a lot.

982
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,650
[Hideous]

983
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,150
Suk Jin couldn't get the cure.
Look at what happened to him.

984
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,980
I had it,
I should've given it to him.

985
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,850
You had it?

986
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,110
Why didn't you give it to him?

987
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,260
Antidote!

988
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,860
He had it.

989
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,800
- I have it...
- That's why you could walk around.

990
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,380
[His anger rises suddenly.]

991
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,440
I couldn't find him.

992
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,850
It's not that you couldn't...

993
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,580
that's why he could walk around
the building so freely.

994
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,180
[You had the cure,
but you kept watching?]

995
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,110
[Charge!]

996
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,920
[Angry zombie Big Nose's
target is Giraffe.]

997
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,930
He bit him!

998
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,760
[An eye for an eye,
a zombie for a zombie?]

999
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,500
[Was Big Nose's revenge successful?]

1000
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,140
[He's relaxed about it.]

1001
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,070
[Here, bite me as much as you want.]

1002
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,710
[Big Nosed zombie is in front of him]

1003
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,480
[but he doesn't bat an eye.]

1004
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,180
[You watched me turn into a zombie]

1005
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,090
[and laughed at me!]

1006
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,990
[You had the cure,
but you didn't help me.]

1007
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:40,730
[I want revenge by making
you a zombie, but I can't.]

1008
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,140
[No matter how much you bite me,
it doesn't matter to me.]

1009
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:54,340
[I have the antido...]

1010
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:59,070
[He dropped it!]

1011
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,260
[I have to find it no matter what!]

1012
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,470
Friend!

1013
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,830
[Welcome to the zombie world.]

1014
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,670
This is bad, it's over if Kwang Soo
turns into a zombie.

1015
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,200
[He's the icon of betrayal,
a war will break out.]

1016
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,940
No!

1017
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,840
Not the cure!

1018
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,080
It's not going to work!

1019
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,220
[He drinks what's left in the bottle.]
It's not enough.

1020
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,470
[Throws and tramples]

1021
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,450
I drank it, now what?

1022
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,720
It's this much short.

1023
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,190
What's wrong?
Why can he speak so well?

1024
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,850
Am I going to be a zombie?

1025
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:49,540
Feel, touch, cross!

1026
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,600
I don't want to be.
I saved six people!

1027
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,340
I saved six!

1028
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,780
Let me find the cure!

1029
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,910
- I must find the cure!
- Friend...

1030
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,450
[He needs to find the
cure within 30 minutes!]

1031
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,320
Antidote!
Have you seen any?

1032
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,560
Move away!
Antidote!

1033
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,360
My badge!

1034
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,630
Antidote, cure!

1035
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,340
It's fine.
We're fine.

1036
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,420
[Ji Hyo puts him
at his ease like a real agent.]

1037
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,680
Where did you find all the...

1038
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,780
Are you okay?

1039
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,820
Do you want to go with me?

1040
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,790
[What is he talking about?]

1041
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,720
[I need to rescue people...]

1042
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,160
We're fine.

1043
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,130
[Oh, my!
That's...]

1044
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,860
Antidote!

1045
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,560
[As soon as she sees Giraffe,
they're immediately on stealth.]

1046
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,670
Antidote!
Have you seen the cure?

1047
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,870
[Forget the answer!]
[Run for your life!]

1048
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,270
Antidote!

1049
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:09,280
- I'm in trouble!
- You have the cure, right?

1050
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,620
[With Kwang Soo's call,
a crowd of zombies follows him.]

1051
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,670
Jae Suk, I rescued six people!

1052
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,790
- You don't have the cure?
- No, I don't.

1053
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,690
[Completely surrounded]

1054
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:27,690
[While Agent Jae Suk holds the zombies,
Agent Ji Hyo hides the survivor away.]

1055
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,420
[Agent Jae Suk is left alone
with the zombies.]

1056
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,170
[Bite]

1057
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,800
Kwang Soo, you...
[He got bitten by the zombie!]

1058
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,600
I had no choice!

1059
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,020
This is how you play?

1060
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,580
I have no choice but to do this.

1061
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,950
You called all the zombies...

1062
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,960
This is upsetting!

1063
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,050
Go find the cure,
you're bitten by five zombies.

1064
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,110
Seriously, you are...

1065
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,820
No, just practice before
you become a zombie.

1066
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,620
- I have no time.
- Let's work together.

1067
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,540
We're friends now.
Wait a moment.

1068
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,700
[Agent Jae Suk is infected.]

1069
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,890
We survived!

1070
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,500
[Agent Ji Hyo and the survivor
escaped the building.]

1071
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,760
What a trouble for you!

1072
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,510
I see many people here.

1073
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,850
[Agent Song Ji Hyo successfully
rescued the survivor.]

1074
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,400
I got scared!

1075
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,470
[While searching for the cure,
he's back at the lab.]

1076
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,740
Someone drank it already.

1077
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,290
[An empty bottle]

1078
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,200
[Disappointed]

1079
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,780
Where is the cure?

1080
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:43,250
Antidote, cure!

1081
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,670
Antidote, cure!

1082
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:50,210
I don't have time!

1083
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,610
Antidote!

1084
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,410
Oh no!

1085
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,940
[His face changed]

1086
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,830
[and his eyes changed.]

1087
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,830
[But why does he look natural?]

1088
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:19,740
[I'm not Kwang Soo any longer,
I'm just a zombie!]

1089
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,110
Ha Ha...

1090
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:25,280
Ha Ha!

1091
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,210
[Don't let me catch you!]

1092
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:35,120
[Agent Haroro is searching
the basement level four.]

1093
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,860
[He found something?]

1094
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,360
[He found a laptop which has
a clue about the zombies.]

1095
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,030
Save me!

1096
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:53,400
Save me!

1097
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,450
[Someone's asking for help!]
Where's it from?

1098
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,870
Did someone ask for help?

1099
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:07,710
[Content of observation]
[We found a new fact.]

1100
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:12,090
[It's a surprising turn!]
[A surprising turn?]

1101
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,190
Help me!

1102
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:18,360
I'm a survivor, please save me!

1103
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,800
- Save me!
- Gary.

1104
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,500
There's must be someone out there.

1105
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,930
[It sounds desperate.]
Save me!

1106
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,640
[Save me...]

1107
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,610
[I can't control them any longer.]
[I've created a monster.]

1108
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,650
Is that a woman or a man?

1109
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,850
[Agent Ji Hyo follows the
voice without doubt.]

1110
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:44,790
Save me!

1111
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,990
What about Ji Hyo?

1112
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,620
[Scream]

1113
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,020
[A group of zombies tricked the agents.]

1114
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,670
[And their leader Big Nose!]

1115
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,110
[She's bitten.]

1116
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,970
Friend... friend!

1117
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,440
Friend...
[Agent Song Ji Hyo is infected.]

1118
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,580
[Now the zombies are
as smart as humans.]

1119
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,580
[Save me...]

1120
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,450
[Here's a "person."]

1121
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,850
The zombies talk now.

1122
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:26,070
They sounds just like humans.

1123
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,860
They're coming.
They're coming as a group!

1124
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,160
Why are they coming all together?

1125
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,510
They can move along the stairs!

1126
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,560
[The stairs are not
a safe zone any more!]

1127
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,970
Why do they chase us?
Why do they do it?

1128
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,670
[The zombies have no limits!]

1129
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:47,050
[Kwang Zombie is acting
like a leader already.]

1130
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:52,050
Feel... touch... cross!

1131
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,960
Ha Ha... Ha Ha...

1132
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,890
Jong Kook...
bite him...

1133
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,600
[Zombie Big Nose and Kwang Soo
are full of vengeance.]

1134
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:13,690
[The grim air is spreading
from behind the door.]

1135
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,670
[Agent Jae Suk became a zombie!]

1136
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:21,090
[Three agents have been turned
into zombies already!]

1137
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,020
I'm bitten!

1138
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,820
[Ji Hyo's bitten but she keeps rescuing
the survivor before the virus spreads.]

1139
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,760
[She uses the fact zombies don't
attack the ones who are bitten.]

1140
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,220
[Big Nose zombie follows them around.]

1141
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,380
[He bit him!]

1142
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,160
What are you doing?

1143
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,300
Are you bitten?

1144
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:57,850
Let's find the cure together!

1145
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,110
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha are at the lobby.]

1146
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,060
[Currently, the number of
the agents who are uninfected]

1147
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,600
[are three out of seven.]

1148
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,030
You and I, you saw I drank
the cure, right?

1149
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,840
Except who was bit or became zombies?

1150
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,010
- So, it's us and Gary.
- Only three of us.

1151
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,960
Then what do we do?

1152
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,140
<i>There are three survivors
inside the building.</i>

1153
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,600
How do we rescue them when the
zombies are running around?

1154
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:38,380
[They don't have much time left.]
Somewhere here...

1155
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,190
[It's the cure!]

1156
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:47,100
We found it!

1157
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,450
There's only one.

1158
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,400
I'm bitten already!

1159
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm bitten.

1160
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,100
I'm not lying.
Look at it.

1161
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,670
I'm bitten, and he's bitten.

1162
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:00,680
Don't attack us,
we're both bitten.

1163
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,880
We're all friends!
[She calmly walks to the stairs.]

1164
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,100
Don't attack us.

1165
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,220
[They successfully escaped.]

1166
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:13,910
[The two of them are infected,
but there's only one cure.]

1167
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:18,260
Drink it quickly.
You need to survive first.

1168
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,420
I'll go find the cure.

1169
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,940
[She gives the cure to the survivor,
and goes back to the building.]

1170
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,820
Stay here, I'll be back!

1171
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,940
Lee Kwang Soo, the cure you had...

1172
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,980
Lee Kwang Soo!

1173
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,010
Kwang Soo!

1174
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,250
[We finally meet here!]

1175
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,940
Do you remember me?

1176
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,860
[Of course I do!]

1177
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,820
[I'll get you!]

1178
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,800
Why are you looking at me?
[Kwang Zombie's only target is Ha Ha.]

1179
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,130
[He's running away at full speed.]

1180
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,160
Why are you only following me?

1181
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,870
It wasn't my idea,
I heard what they had to say.

1182
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,290
I could live.
[If not you.]

1183
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,240
I didn't have to wear this makeup.

1184
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,000
[He can't forget his grudge.]

1185
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,720
I rescued six people.

1186
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:21,920
You tried to kill me
when I was drinking mine.

1187
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,090
[It's best to avoid the
zombie with a grudge.]

1188
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,460
[He won't be able to come inside.]

1189
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,700
No, no!

1190
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:45,210
[He tires to avoid Kwang Zombie,
but meets with Grasshopper Zombie.]

1191
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,540
Wait, wait!

1192
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:50,090
Come, my friends!

1193
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,380
[Open the door,
Ha Ha's mine.]

1194
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,270
Come over here, my friends!

1195
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,420
[Scream]

1196
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,320
[Bite, bite, bite]

1197
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,290
[No, you can't...]
Let's go back.

1198
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,780
At least, I wasn't
bitten by Lee Kwang Soo.

1199
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,070
I'm already bitten.

1200
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:11,300
[Why you little!]

1201
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:15,850
It's all because of you!
[You made me a zombie!]

1202
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:18,340
- I should bite him!
- I'm already bit.

1203
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:23,740
[Blank Ji doesn't have much time left.]
Where's Kwang Soo?

1204
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,780
Kwang Soo is...

1205
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,290
[What's that?]

1206
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:42,090
[The super-arm she found
at the weapon storage.]

1207
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,580
[If we use the neck warmer, she can
put the zombie to sleep forever.]

1208
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:50,400
[She kept hidden the weapon
to eliminate the zombies.]

1209
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,580
[It's time for revenge!]

1210
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,960
[Burst]

1211
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,710
[It was close but she failed.]

1212
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,950
You made me into a zombie!

1213
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:07,620
What are you doing, friends?

1214
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,070
I can put this on anyone, you know!

1215
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,580
- What are you doing?
- Come over here!

1216
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,860
- Why?
- Song Ji Hyo, Song Ji Hyo!

1217
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,420
[No one's on my side...]

1218
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,910
[then, I'll run away.]

1219
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,560
[Catch the big-nosed zombie!]

1220
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,210
[We meet again.]
I hate to see them.

1221
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,450
[It's Kim Jong Kook!]

1222
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:38,420
He's... wearing... a jacket...

1223
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,460
What a...

1224
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,490
selfish... bastard!

1225
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,360
Kwang Soo...

1226
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,860
[The zombie couple]

1227
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,910
[Laugh]

1228
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:53,630
[Perfect sync]

1229
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,400
We'll get you!

1230
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,980
Just come over here!

1231
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,940
He's the only one wearing a jacket!

1232
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,640
He doesn't want to get cold!

1233
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,850
[They're afraid to attack him.]
I'm sorry.

1234
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,310
If we wear the red thing, we might...

1235
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,960
- Are you bitten?
- Yes...

1236
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,710
Really?
Show me your arm.

1237
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,400
[He's pretending to be infected.]

1238
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,510
[Is he really bitten?]

1239
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,780
[Run]

1240
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,050
[He escapes by acting to be infected.]

1241
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:27,740
[As the zombies evolve,
the humans evolve, too?]

1242
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:31,110
Antidote, I'll die if I can't find it.

1243
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:34,020
[Ha Ha is busy searching
for the cure.]

1244
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,140
[He found the cure.]

1245
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,710
[Thrilled]

1246
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:51,380
How could this be here?
Aren't I amazing?

1247
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,730
[It's the second time he
drinks the cure.]

1248
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,490
I'll drink it first,
and pretend I didn't.

1249
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I drank two cures now.

1250
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,940
[Thanks to his eagle eyes...]
Don't tell anyone.

1251
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,290
[he's not going to become a zombie.]

1252
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,420
[At that time, the agents
get the radio from the base.]

1253
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:23,290
<i>All the agents who survived,
to the base!</i>

1254
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,340
- Gary.
- What's the current situation?

1255
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,760
Thank you for your work.

1256
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,380
From the sacrifice of our military,
we could save a lot of people.

1257
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,370
Let's check what
Doctor Yeom passed onto us.

1258
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:40,740
[Doctor Yeom's secret research
brought by Jae Suk]

1259
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,270
She was contacted by zombies
but wasn't infected.

1260
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:48,400
She must have an antibody!

1261
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:52,600
We can make a vaccine in quantities.

1262
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,920
Basement level three, restricted area.
The password is 2710.

1263
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,070
That's the key to this problem.

1264
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:02,600
Wait a minute, what do we do?

1265
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,530
[A secret capsule
is hidden in the building]

1266
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,450
[and the girl is sleeping in it.]

1267
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:12,730
We checked all the survivors you rescued,
but the girl is not on the list.

1268
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,220
Then, she must be inside the building.

1269
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,360
She's resistant to the Zombie Virus,
only if we can rescue this girl

1270
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,220
will the nation be saved.

1271
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:25,380
Infiltrate to the building
and rescue this girl, dismissed!

1272
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,050
[The girl rules the fate
of the zombie war.]

1273
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,250
[Will they be able to rescue her?]

1274
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:41,060
[It smells like human again...]

1275
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,200
[Ha Ha and Gary infiltrate
to the basement level three.]

1276
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:51,310
[Find the hidden restricted area!]

1277
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:55,080
[Kkuk is heading to the
basement level three.]

1278
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,840
We need to hurry and get there!

1279
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,720
Maybe there's a hidden doorway.

1280
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,820
[Where's the restricted area?]

1281
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,450
It's not here.
Where's the restricted area?

1282
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,590
Wasn't it here?

1283
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:17,460
[Restricted area]
[He found it!]

1284
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,540
[Inside the metal door,
there's a secret door.]

1285
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:26,870
[We found it, finally!]

1286
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:33,310
[The password: 2710]

1287
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,780
[In here...]

1288
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,820
[the ultimate weapon will be.]

1289
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:46,890
[She can finish the zombie war!]

1290
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:51,860
[Will they be able to cut their way
through and safely rescue her?]

1291
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:55,960
The capsule is right there!

1292
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,620
Is she sleeping in the pod?

1293
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,180
How do we wake her up?

1294
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,740
[Is there any way to wake her up?]

1295
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,740
[Something's going on...]

1296
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:12,450
[We need to find humans...]

1297
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:17,490
Se Hwi, we need to get out!
We don't have time!

1298
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:19,540
It moves!

1299
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:23,660
[The pod is moving.]

1300
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,800
She's so pretty.

1301
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,000
She's awake.

1302
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,910
[The capsule opens]

1303
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,010
[and the girl wakes up.]

1304
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,250
[Shin Se Hwi]
[Her DNA is resistant to zombies.]

1305
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,820
Who are you?

1306
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,780
- We came to rescue you.
- Are you Shin Se Hwi?

1307
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,340
We'll rescue you to save the mankind,
so we can make the vaccine.

1308
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,200
Just follow us, we'll protect you.

1309
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,800
[Only if we can lead her to the base...]

1310
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,870
[Do not let the humans escape!]

1311
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:30,860
[Humans, it won't be easy to get out!]

1312
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,590
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

1313
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,860
[Let's escape!]

1314
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,670
We need to run,
we don't have time!

1315
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,200
We need to run!

1316
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,370
We need to escape!

1317
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:46,840
I've got bitten already.
[Are zombies make their way?]

1318
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,110
Escape quickly!

1319
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,610
What's wrong?

1320
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,650
[Scream]

1321
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:59,420
[Jong Kook, get out
while I hold onto them...]

1322
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,620
We don't have time for Gary and Ha Ha.

1323
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,190
They might turn into zombies.

1324
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:08,060
Se Hwi!
I hope the vaccine will be developed!

1325
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,400
[I hope you escape....]

1326
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,850
[They're not attacked by
the zombie to a wonder.]

1327
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,640
Just one more floor, Se Hwi.

1328
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,640
[Welcome, humans...]

1329
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,150
[Something's wrong...]

1330

[The zombies aren't attacking us?]

1331
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,890
[Then, I can escape, too...]

1332
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:45,780
[If he can get out of the building,
Jong Kook will win the race.]

1333
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,760
[Where do you think you're going?]

1334
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,110
[We won't let you go that easily.]

1335
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,710
[If the girl escapes,
the zombies will fall.]

throws his body to block the zombies.]

[It's too late for us, anyway!]

1341
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:27,070
[Leave the zombies with us.]

1342
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:30,270
- I'm already bitten!
- I just want to bite you!

1343
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:33,010
