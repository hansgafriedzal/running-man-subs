00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,677
[Christmas special]
[Running Man]


3
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:09,018
[Running X-man]


4
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:10,837
Real situation!


5
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:12,618
Good Sunday!


6
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:14,788
X-man!


7
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:17,957
Hello!
You must have been surprised!


8
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:20,757
- You must be surprised.
- Why X-man all of a sudden?


9
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:22,797
They probably thought
it was an old rerun.


10
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:29,388
You might have been thinking
this was an old show, but since


11
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:37,658
it's almost Christmas, we have a special
collaboration with X-man and Running Man.


12
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:39,633
[Ten years later!]


13
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,607
[X-man and Running Man
together at last!]


14
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:43,347
[And!]


15
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,987
[There's something special
in Running Man!]


16
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:48,817
[What's the hidden special mission?]


17
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:51,857
- Team Leader Kim!
- Yes?


18
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,497
This is usually Ho Dong's spot.


19
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,097
And after so many years,
Team Leader Kim is standing here.


20
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,097
I've been promoted.


21
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:59,828
He's been promoted.


22
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:02,298
This spot is for the big guys.


23
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:05,507
This spot was usually Kang Ho Dong's.


24
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,537
In this spot, there was
Kim Jae Dong, Park Kyung Lim


25
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:11,128
and Gong Hyung Jin.
There have been many changes.


26
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:13,078
It's not a very good spot.


27
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:15,248
- It keeps changing.
- It does.


28
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:17,608
Our team leaders may have changed


29
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:21,188
but it will be just like
X-man from 10 years ago.


30
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,128
Please welcome the
members of both teams!


31
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,837
Please give them a round of applause!


32
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:28,188
I'm so excited to see
who our guests are!


33
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,427
Gary!


34
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:31,897
Lee Kwang Soo!


35
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,097
Bobby, B.I, Song Ji Hyo


36
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:36,067
Kim Ji Min, Seol Hyun!


37
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,737
Andy!


38
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:41,298
[Who will their opponents be?]


39
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,278
Gary!


40
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:45,237
[Chae Yeon, Lee Ji Hyeon,
Kim Jung Nam, Stephanie]


41
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,378
[Andy, Lee Jong Soo, Ha Ha.]


42
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,608
Jin Sook!
Ji Hyeon!


43
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,477
Kim Jung Nam, Andy!


44
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,447
Eagle Eye!
(Pun: it also means glaring.)


45
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,808
[The special members have entered!]


46
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:58,787
It's Eagle Eye!


47
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,287
[Nice to meet you.]


48
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,628
[Everyone's focused on
the veteran, Eagle Eye.]


49
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:09,627
I was so surprised as soon
when they came out!


50
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,967
So we have two teams,
Team Kim and Team Ji.


51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:20,078
Team Kim is with people who played
a major role in X-man back in the day.


52
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:22,508
And they're the members of X-man 2005.


53
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,478
And on this team,
although they weren't on X-man before


54
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,437
if there X-man was still around today


55
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:32,927
they would be on 2015's X-man.


56
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,237
Today, we will...


57
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,728
- I want to go there.
- Where?


58
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,367
Jin Sook, you need to stay there.


59
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,527
[Her real name was released!]


60
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,897
[Jung Nam who's never been
on X-man is on their team?]


61
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,987
Team Leader Kim suggested him.


62
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:48,807
[He was allowed in.]
(Ex-Turbo member)


63
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:52,578
- Another Turbo album is coming out.
- Yes it is!


64
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:55,608
Let's introduce everyone, one by one.


65
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,318
I haven't seen this guest in a while.


66
00:02:58,318 --> 00:02:59,677
It's been a long time.


67
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:02,987
- Her stage name is Chae Yeon...
- Jin Sook!


68
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,918
Jin Sook!


69
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,418
[X-man's legendary Sexy Queen!
Chae Yeon]


70
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:12,057
We have to talk about your
romance with Kim Jong Kook.


71
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,557
He was playing hard to get


72
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:16,427
but he leaned more
towards Yoon Eun Hye, right?


73
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,568
Yes, I wasn't enough...


74
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,807
Do you actually like
Kim Jong Kook back in the day?


75
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:25,168
Maybe I did since I was young.


76
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,638
[Shy]


77
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:29,407
- Is he no good now?
- We're very awkward now!


78
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,177
Don't ask about the past.


79
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,348
Why is your back to your teammates?


80
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,418
[He becomes smaller in front of
his girl teammates.]


81
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,818
If he looks at you, you look away.


82
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,217
And when you look at him,
he looks away.


83
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,948
He's really weird.


84
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:44,388
[It's suspicious.]


85
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:46,228
What are you doing?


86
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,457
You can still find love now, right?


87
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,867
X-man doesn't work like that.


88
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,268
How does it work, then?


89
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,897
[Glance]


90
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:00,008
Gary!
Stop looking at Seol Hyun.


91
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,207
Did I get caught?


92
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,677
Did I get caught?


93
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,647
You look at her too much!


94
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,617
I was staring the entire time.


95
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:10,418
[He was scanning her
underneath his sunglasses.]


96
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,187
He stares at her too much!


97
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,418
[Can't you pay attention?]


98
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,918
[Who's the second member of Team Kim?]


99
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,298
She was a legend at
the game "Of course."


100
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:26,267
[Queen of "Of course!",
Lee Ji Hyeon]


101
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,038
<i>I really like you!</i>


102
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,567
<i>Clap, clap, clap!</i>


103
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,877
It's been a while, Ji Hyeon.


104
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:35,747
She has since gotten married


105
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:38,567
and has become
a mother of two.


106
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,127
She was talking about
her kids behind the stage.


107
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,987
I was talking about
how much time has passed.


108
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:47,927
Do you miss any of the X-man
members that aren't here right now?


109
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:50,088
Kim Je Dong!


110
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,088
Is there a reason?


111
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,358
When we played "Of course"


112
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:57,057
I remember saying "you don't have
lenses in your glasses, right?"


113
00:04:57,057 --> 00:05:00,057
I still feel so bad about that


114
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:02,468
You asked if I took steroids!


115
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,007
[That's harsh.]


116
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,767
<i>You're less than 160 centimeters, right?</i>


117
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,708
<i>[2005 X-man, "Of course" game.]</i>


118
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:15,177
<i>Did you get those muscles
by taking drugs?</i>


119
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:22,487
[Mr. Capable was KO'ed
at her spiteful remark.]


120
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:26,088
- Do you still remember that?
- He holds grudges.


121
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:31,478
She had the title of a Queen just to
win the game and stuff but


122
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,677
your personality isn't
like that at all, right?


123
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:37,028
It's done so much damage


124
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,877
as I lived throughout my life.


125
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:42,697
I literally had to prepare so much
just for the game, at home.


126
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:44,038
I prepared, but...


127
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,807
- People thought I was a mean person...
- I thought that, too.


128
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:54,588
So I've prepared again today!


129
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,517
[Her spiteful remarks
start once again!]


130
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:59,458
I'm going to do it again!


131
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,288
<i>You used to date Yoon Eun Hye for real
back when we filmed X-man, right?</i>


132
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:09,608
[The Queen's instincts have
awoken after ten years!]


133
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:14,398
[It will be revealed soon!]


134
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,937
Wow, Ji Hyeon.
Next up is


135
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:19,908
Stephanie!


136
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:24,108
[X-man's Dancing Queen, Stephanie.]


137
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:28,317
She was the icon of the dance segment.


138
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,218
She just goes by "Stephanie" now.


139
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,218
But she was "Cheonmu Stephanie."
(Heavenly Dancer)


140
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:36,028
She was Cheonmu Stephanie
of "The Grace."


141
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,958
All the members had nicknames.


142
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,947
"Heavenly Dancer Stephanie"


143
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:44,127
"Divine Beauty Lina,"
"Soft Voice Sunday," "Delightful Dana."


144
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,168
Delightful Dana?


145
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,567
Her tone changed!


146
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,807
She sounds like a middle aged woman.


147
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,137
- I was the youngest.
- You were!


148
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,747
I'm still the youngest on this team.


149
00:06:56,747 --> 00:07:00,317
[Big gestures and greasy comments.]


150
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,447
Even her walk is different.


151
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,887
What's with that gesture?


152
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,788
Her movements, too.


153
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,817
She speaks like an old lady.


154
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:16,557
I don't know if it's possible, but I'll
try my best to "shake it" later on.


155
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,697
Yes, Stephanie!


156
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:23,668
Next up after Stephanie
is Kim Jung Nam!


157
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:28,778
[The return of Turbo's engine,
Kim Jung Nam.]


158
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,278
I'm a Turbo fan.


159
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:34,007
- How many years has it been?
- 20 years.


160
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:37,187
You're coming back as Turbo!


161
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:41,458
Our album is being released
tonight at midnight.


162
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,387
["Again", Turbo's new song.]


163
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,788
[Turbo's coming back
with a stronger engine!]


164
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:50,767
[Jong Kook, Jung Nam, and Mikey.
After 20 years]


165
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,098
[they're coming back as a whole,
and the countdown starts!]


166
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,927
How does it feel
to be reunited as Turbo?


167
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,528
We were a dyad before,
and now we're a trio.


168
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,747
They don't really say dyad nowadays.


169
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:05,528
- Dyad?
- A dyad?


170
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:11,817
Every comment is
taking me down memory lane.


171
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:15,637
We were a dyad, but became a trio.
So my part shrunk.


172
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:19,728
- Your rap part?
- When we record and I make a mistake


173
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,887
I should say "okay" to Jong Kook


174
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:24,158
but instead I politely say "yes."


175
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:27,228
Time has passed.


176
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:30,767
It's as if you're treating
him like a rookie.


177
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:36,638
[Turbo is coming soon!]


178
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:39,278
And next up is Andy!


179
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,878
[King of Hearts, Andy.]


180
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:45,618
Back in the day,
he used to do heart dances.


181
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:47,817
Do you remember Andy's heart dance?


182
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,128
Yes, that's right.


183
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,388
Everyone was dancing
the heart dance in clubs.


184
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:54,607
He was there, at the clubs.


185
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,498
[He goes to clubs to spread the dance?]


186
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:59,028
Do you remember the heart dance?


187
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:03,477
[Seol Hyun mastered
the heart dance?]


188
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,807
She's the best!


189
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,508
Why are you smiling?


190
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:15,008
Because I like her!
Why do you keep asking?


191
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,778
Gary, be cool!


192
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:22,087
[He can't keep a poker face
in front of Seol Hyun.]


193
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,648
- Andy!
- Yes?


194
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:28,118
It's been such a long time.
Can we see the original dance?


195
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:34,398
Is it the front pocket
or the back pocket?


196
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,727
- From the top?
- From his heart.


197
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:41,638
[I am the Prince of Hearts.]


198
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,607
He's still good!


199
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,538
B.I. and Bobby, too!


200
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,518
[It's awesome!]


201
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:55,248
But it's so interesting!


202
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:59,018
It's so smooth when he does it!


203
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,457
He's the original!


204
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:04,298
- You need to do it like this, nowadays.
- Stop it!


205
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:07,028
Don't do it!


206
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:11,368
- Don't make that tiny heart!
- He's so weird!


207
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:14,067
Here, here!
[Here's a gift!]


208
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,898
- It's weird!
- It's not!


209
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,868
It's weird!


210
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,607
Jin Sook, look at this.


211
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:23,707
[This is how I feel for you.]


212
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,548
Why are you taking your
heart out of your bum!


213
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:31,418
Jin Sook, it's from my back pocket!


214
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:34,488
You know me, right?
It's my back pocket!


215
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:38,427
[Be thoughtful when
taking your hearts out!]


216
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:42,498
We'll be looking forward to
Andy's active participation!


217
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,268
And everyone probably
knows him already, but


218
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:49,128
it's Eagle Eye with his glaring eyes!


219
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:53,067
[Eagle Eye, Lee Jong Soo.]


220
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:58,677
You probably all remember
his glaring eyes.


221
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:02,298
Eagle Eye!
More than anything, you...


222
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:04,717
He doesn't say his name!


223
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,048
Do I not have a name?


224
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,388
She's Jin Sook, too.


225
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:13,807
Can you make
eye contact with Ji Hyo?


226
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,697
I think she'll fall for him
in less than a second.


227
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,628
[He's exercising his
extra ocular muscles.]


228
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,528
Please stare into his eyes.


229
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,937
You'll see why his name is Eagle Eye.


230
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,457
Ladies, come and experience this.


231
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:31,408
[He's pouring his love
and passion for Blank Ji.]


232
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:35,778
[Oh my god!]


233
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,918
Eagle Eye!


234
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:43,347
[I haven't given up on you yet!]


235
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:46,278
[You can't look directly
at the intensity.]


236
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:49,457
He's so cool!


237
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:52,197
[Eagle Eye is still passionate
as ever ten years later.]


238
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:55,033
Eagle Eye has come back!


239
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:57,868
Please look forward
to his part here today!


240
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:01,508
This time, we'll introduce
the new X-man members!


241
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:04,077
[It's finally time to
introduce Team Ji's members.]


242
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:10,567
It's Seol Hyun!
[2015's hottest, Seol Hyun.]


243
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:14,548
She's been on Running Man
many times before.


244
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,437
She's like family, now.


245
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:20,187
Why are you stepping forward?


246
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:25,057
[Let's spectate together.]


247
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:27,967
When else would we
get to see her in person?


248
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,768
They've all turned their heads.


249
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,567
You're too much!


250
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,008
You too, stop moving forward!


251
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,038
I can't see because of you!


252
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,177
Get lost!


253
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:43,548
If you move forward to see Seol Hyun,
I move forward then he moves forward!


254
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:47,018
Then he moves forward!
We can't film like this!


255
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:51,018
[Seol Hyun is top priority
over filming.]


256
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,837
I'm really sorry, but I
would really like it if Jong Kook


257
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:57,788
stopped turning his back to me.


258
00:12:57,788 --> 00:12:59,197
You seem awkward.


259
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:02,567
I'm sad because our team is like
a duck egg from Nakdong River.


260
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,187
- A duck egg from Nakdonggang River?
- I haven't heard that in so long!


261
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:08,278
A duck egg from Nakdonggang River.
(Being in misery)


262
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:09,937
That's like a proverb.


263
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:13,238
That's what my dad used to say!


264
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,378
I almost cried!


265
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,807
My face is red!


266
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:25,618
Seol Hyun, could you
show us a few moves?


267
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:28,587
- From "Like a cat."
- Like a cat!


268
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:32,158
[They're all pretending to be a cat.]


269
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,128
I won't do it, so don't do it either.


270
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,477
Please show us.


271
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,697
The movement is like a cat.


272
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:49,038
[They're happy just watching!]


273
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:52,607
[Meow]


274
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,168
[Gentlemen, be joyous!]


275
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,988
She did it to me! All the guys
will think she did it to them!


276
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:02,687
[We saw it.]


277
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,628
You've done everything.


278
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,557
- We got good footage.
- She's cute.


279
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:12,097
- Gary isn't doing much today.
- He's not interested.


280
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:15,067
Why did your face turn so red?


281
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:18,067
[He can't keep a straight face.]


282
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:21,508
[What will be the end to Gary's
pure love for Seol Hyun?]


283
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:26,408
[Gary charges to win
Seol Hyun's heart!]


284
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,977
[Gary is starting his plan on
getting Seol Hyun's heart!]


285
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:32,548
[And!]


286
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,567
[Gary and Seol Hyun are writing
new history in "Of course"?]


287
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,957
Seol Hyun, let's play a game!


288
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:42,857
[How will their fate turn out?]


289
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:46,998
Next up, we have the Queen of comedy


290
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:51,327
Kim Ji Min!
[Queen of comedy, Kim Ji Min.]


291
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:56,138
We haven't filmed X-man in a while...


292
00:14:56,138 --> 00:15:00,648
have you ever thought you could
do well if you were on the show?


293
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:04,648
I think I would have done well
in the game, "Of course."


294
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,087
I think I would've done
better than Lee Ji Hyeon.


295
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,528
[She's challenging the
Queen of "Of course"?]


296
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:11,388
I think Ji Min would do well, too.


297
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:15,727
But since she's married,
I can't really talk about her past.


298
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:17,727
[That's harsh.]


299
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:21,498
- That's not how you play the game.
- Really?


300
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:23,697
You're not supposed to
dig up the past!


301
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,697
Aren't you supposed to
send people off?


302
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:29,268
We'll see them later in "Of course"!


303
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,837
[The true Queen of "Of Course"
will be determined!]


304
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:35,977
<i>My type, my type.</i>


305
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:42,548
It's iKON!
[The hottest iKON, Bobby and B.I.]


306
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:46,087
It's their first time
on a variety show.


307
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,827
- Really?
- Is it really your first time?


308
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:53,028
I took a Cheongsimhwan.
(A pill that calms him down)


309
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,727
He probably thinks that
he's speaking very loud.


310
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:02,437
Isn't your voice a lot
quieter than expected?


311
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:04,038
Yes, it's quiet.


312
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,538
Let's start with a shout.


313
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,778
Yeah!


314
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,908
You need to be twice as loud.


315
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:14,148
He's so good at rapping, though!


316
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:17,217
- Is it your first time too, Bobby?
- Yes.


317
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,488
Why wasn't iKON
on any variety shows?


318
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,918
We were working hard on our music.


319
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,317
Then what about me?
Don't I work on music, too?


320
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,028
[Musician Gary is upset.]


321
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,967
[We didn't mean it like that...]


322
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:35,738
We will be looking forward
to your participation today.


323
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:39,508
Please give iKON
a big round of applause!


324
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,908
We will officially be starting now.


325
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:45,347
2015 Running Man and
X-man collaboration!


326
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:49,148
Dance session!


327
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,518
The music is old-schooled!


328
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:55,947
[The subtitles will
also be old-schooled.]


329
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:59,158
[2015's hottest icon,
Seol Hyun's up first!]


330
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,528
[Shy, shy]


331
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:06,327
[Shift in attitude, head banging.]


332
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:09,268
Seol Hyun, dance with confidence!


333
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,907
[Heart dance 2015,
Seol Hyun's version.]


334
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,508
[I like the heart dance.]


335
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:16,337
This is awesome!
I like this!


336
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,948
[All the men's hearts are melted.]


337
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:25,817
[Did you get a heart attack?
I'm the hottest, Seol Hyun.]


338
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:29,557
Next up is Andy!


339
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:30,758
[The original heart dancer, Andy!]


340
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,897
[Do you remember this heart?]


341
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,788
[Of course!]


342
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,327
[His heart hasn't
changed in ten years.]


343
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,038
[My body remembers it!]


344
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,298
[Do you remember these graphics?]


345
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,708
[The best heart.]


346
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:50,837
[I love it!]


347
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:55,607
[Chae Yeon's dance
is in full force!]


348
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:01,647
[Should we go back to ten years ago?]


349
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,917
[Are you ready?]


350
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,887
[Sexy]


351
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,057
[This is it!]


352
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,867
[Her seductive instincts.
Her name is Chae Yeon.]

[I like it!]


354
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,577
[This is how you do it!]

[Jin Sook of Jinri]
(Pun: Jin Sook is always right)


356
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,248
[Asia's Prince, Kwang Soo!]


357
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:32,317
[Roll]


358
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,788
[Innovative moves!]


359
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:39,357
Dance!
I said dance!


360
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,157
[His writhing series continues.]


361
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,458
I'm really sorry...


362
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,478
[The music is off.]


363
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:54,097
I'm sorry, but this isn't how you do it.


364
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:57,367
You have to keep
the feeling going.


365
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,208
It's the first time that the
music's been cut off on X-man.


366
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,708
- This can't happen.
- I'm sorry.


367
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,847
We'll try it again.


368
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,587
We'll liven up the atmosphere again!


369
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:09,887
[Good luck!]


370
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,248
Please give us the music!


371
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,928
[He lost his confidence
but he still tries hard!]


372
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:17,157
[He's cute.]


373
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:24,067
[Do I do it like this?]


374
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,738
[He tries hard!]


375
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:30,008
[Giraffe is here!]


376

the dance session!]

[The big kid of hip-hop, Bobby!]


379
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:46,048
Bobby!

[Krumping]


383
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,867
[She went blank at
his shocking dance.]


384
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,667
Next up is B.I!


385
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,478
[He's a prepared rookie, B.I!]


386
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:14,057
[His moves come naturally.]


387
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,018
B.I, give us a little more!

390
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,857
[Can I do that?]


391
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,928
Yeah, it's awesome!


392
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:34,867
[He reminded us of all the
dancing machines in the past.]


393

[Of course!]


396
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:48,208
[The subtitles that waited for
this man ten years ago...]

[Perfect teamwork between the two.]


404
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:19,577
Eagle Eye, Lee Jong Soo!


405
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,208
[What dance did Jong Soo do?]


406
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,478
[Shy, shy]


407
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:25,847
Eagle Eye!


408
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:30,018
[It's back, the dirty dance!]


409
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:32,988
[Shocked]


410
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,357
[He's quite aggressive.]


411
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,958
[His dance is in between seducing
and provoking a dispute.]


412
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:45,208
[He still has desire
left in his eyes.]


413
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,807

as ten years ago.]

[The girl who became a legend,
Stephanie.]


431
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:58,657
[Shall we enjoy this like it's 2005?]


432
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:02,107
[She deserves the name.]


433
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,867
Awesome!


434
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,548
[A heavenly dance that sends
shivers down your spine.]


435
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:15,157
[She's speeding up her dance.]


436
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:21,057
[Her dance is a classic
for dance session.]


437
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:26,228
[They're going wild.]


438
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,597
We will be starting officially!


439
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:32,167
[Running Man and X-man's
collaboration starts now!]


440
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:37,327
[The table's full of presents like
a typical Running Man Christmas.]


441
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:41,147
[It's as if Santa left them
a gift for their hard work, dancing.]


442
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:44,048
[It's filled with
sweet Christmas cakes.]


443
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:48,688
[They're re-energizing.]


444
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,157
While you eat casually


445
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:55,698
you will be given a secret command.


446
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:59,528
Ha Ha, would you like to go up first?


447
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,768
[They will be given the command:
"you are/aren't X-man."]


448
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,857
Please pay close attention
to his expression.


449
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:08,478
[Running Man Producer]


450
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:12,607
The current Running Man PD used to
give the command on X-man back then.


451
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,238
Hello?


452
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:16,548
- Hello.
- It's been a while.


453
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:18,218
It's been a while.


454
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,317
[It's been a while
since this atmosphere.]


455
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:24,317
[You are/aren't]


456
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:26,968
[X-man.]


457
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,228
That's right!
Pay attention!


458
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:33,627
[Overreacting Ha Ha, is he X-man?]


459
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:38,538
[You are/aren't]


460
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:39,857
[X-man.]


461
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:41,738
[Unresponsive B.I is X-man?]


462
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,238
Please let me be X-man!


463
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:48,208
[Is this all a scheme?]


464
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:51,417
[Is the hottest girl given
an important role?]


465
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,387
[Is the glare of X-man?]


466
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:57,018
[Is it nervous Kwang Soo?]


467
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,357
Is it true?


468
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,557
[What's the meaning
behind Stephanie's smile?]


469
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:07,698
Me?
[Ji Min's casual acting is suspicious.]


470
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,028
[Is it silent Andy?]


471
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,498
[Did Bobby smile for the special role?]


472
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:17,607
[Queen]


473
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,637
[Ace]


474
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:25,587
[And Mr. Capable.
We can't tell with their reactions...]


475
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:28,417
[Could it be Big-nose?]


476
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,498
What?


477
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:35,038
It's me?
Really?


478
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,887
[Terrible actor Gary, is it him?]


479
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,367
[Running Man Christmas special,
X-man has been selected!]


480
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:43,948
[We filmed this part
in the same style.]


481
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:47,587
[X-man's counterattack
is about to start.]


482
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,298
Who is it?


483
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,057
- I'm so curious!
- You're dead!


484
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:56,748
[Who is X-man?]


485
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:02,587
[X-man is starting to act
as a spy from now on.]


486
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:05,768
[The Running Man have experienced
countless of betrayals for five years.]


487
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:08,317
[Will they be able to keep
their identities hidden?]


488
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:14,657
[They come one by one
in their changed uniforms.]


489
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,327
What's with him... his pants!


490
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,807
[Yoo Hyuk wore his pants backwards.]


491
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,748
B.I and Bobby wore
their pants properly...


492
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,057
[I copied them
because they looked cool...]


493
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:27,038
I'm actually so embarrassed!


494
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,147
- I doubted it.
- Ha Ha did it, too.


495
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:31,907
Why didn't you guys
wear it backwards?


496
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:34,647
[The trend changed already!
The concept is to wear it low.]


497
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:38,298
[It's a long and rough path
to being a fashionista.]


498
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:41,958
Now, it's time to
play a game altogether.


499
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:47,057
We will start "Go fight"!
(modification of Tug-of-war)


500
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:50,698
You probably already know


501
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:55,337
you have teams on both sides.
We've done this on Running Man


502
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:58,208
a couple times over water.
We're very used to it.


503
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,307
Both teams will play
best two out of three.


504
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:04,678
X-man has been selected.


505
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:07,877
It will be too easy if X-man


506
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,617
actively plays their part now.


507
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:10,617
- That's true.
- Yes.


508
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:16,657
That is why there is R-man today,
since it's a collaboration.


509
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:21,958
[R-Man?
What's that?]


510
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:25,867
R-man will be helping X-man.


511
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,867
[R-man will help X-man.]


512
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:31,238
So when they got the call,
did they say "you are R-man"?


513
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:33,938
[The R-man was already assigned!]
[Who is it?]


514
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:40,978
[While everyone was
getting changed.]


515
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:47,718
[The person coming out
of the building is?]


516
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:51,458
[Lee Kwang Soo]


517
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,928
Why me?


518
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:56,428
[What's going on?]


519
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:01,798
[He's laughing?]


520
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:06,837
Because we're holding an
X-man special on Running Man


521
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:10,307
we will be giving you
a special mission.


522
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:12,978
You are not X-man.


523
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:17,817
However, you are R-man.


524
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:22,587
[I am R-man?]


525
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:25,788
You will be helping so that
X-man's team loses.


526
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,387
You will protect X-man
with different tactics.


527
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,367
If X-man doesn't get
caught until the end


528
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,498
it will be X-man
and R-man's victory.


529
00:28:35,268 --> 00:28:38,587
X-man will know that there's R-man
but they won't know who it is.


530
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:41,438
I was a little upset
that I wasn't X-man.


531
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,877
[Will Kwang Soo be able to
carry out his role well?]


532
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:48,548
[His top priority is finding
X-man in order to help them!]


533
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:52,367
If we can't find out, then the prize
is shared between X-man and R-man.


534
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:55,887
So we could be confused whether
they're X-man or R-man.


535
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,917
It could be R-man!


536
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,387
To make it seem like they're X-man?


537
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:00,557
You're top on the list!


538
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,788
You're pretty suspicious.


539
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:05,228
Anyway, if X-man succeeds


540
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:09,038
then R-man will also win
and share the prize.


541
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,397
Rux... X-man and Running Man...


542
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,807
- Rux Man?
- What's Rux Man?


543
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,657
It's a collaboration between
R-man and X-man.


544
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,077
[I need to find X-man!]


545
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,807
I'm sorry but,
is this even competition?


546
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,948
[The proficient and experienced Team Kim
vs. the less-prepared newbies Team Ji.]


547
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:27,748
If X-man is on that team


548
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:29,548
isn't the mission way too easy?


549
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:32,647
If Jong Kook is X-man,
we're in big trouble.


550
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,587
Exactly.


551
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:37,127
[Is Kkuk X-man?]


552
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:41,557
You need to pay attention!
People do stuff like this on camera!


553
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:44,867
[X-man will be giving hints on camera.]


554
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:49,367
[They need to observe carefully!]


555
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:52,307
[Kwang Soo makes an
R sign instead of an X.]


556
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:55,077
Okay, we're starting!


557
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,107
[Round one of "Go fight."]


558
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:59,248
[Big-nose pushes
Seol Hyun to the front.]


559
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,347
[Goddess' shield]


560
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:02,877
[Complaints]


561
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:05,448
Let's go without Seol Hyun!


562
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,057
Why?


563
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,008
We lost, we lost!


564
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:13,458
[The guys on Team Kim are
helpless in front of Seol Hyun.]


565
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,298
Are you kidding?
I will push you!


566
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:18,028
[In a foul mood.]


567
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:22,298
Chae Yeon returned as a heroine.


568
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,938
She's intense!


569
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:26,432
[If they have heroine
Chae Yeon on Team Kim]


570
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,178
[they have Ace Song
Ji Hyo on Team Ji.]


571
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:30,978
Jin Sook, you need to go ahead.


572
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:35,647
You sound so awkward!
You guys don't seem close!


573
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:40,117
[Go fight starts with a polite bow.]


574
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:43,387
[Heroine vs. Ace]


575
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:45,087
It's no joke.


576
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:49,357
[She's already using her
superhuman strength.]


577
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,698
[Surprised]


578
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:54,268
[But Ji Hyo isn't easy either!]


579
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:57,798
[Both teams are
already pretty intense.]


580
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,807
[She's not that weak.]


581
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:03,538
[It's no joke!]


582
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,907
[But, they're making the
two women work so hard...]


583
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,317
[Oh, my arm hurts.]


584
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:12,607
Men should come forward!


585
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:15,847
- Come forward!
- Am I crazy?


586
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,347
[Tiger is waiting for him,
why would he?]


587
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:21,057
It makes sense.


588
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:23,407
Look, Suk Jin folded his arms.


589
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:26,438
[One on one match]
Let's finish it quickly!


590
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:28,798
[Team Kim's runner will be Kkuk.]


591
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,567
[Who will be Team Ji's runner?]


592
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:34,147
[Seol Hyun is Team Ji's runner.]


593
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:35,867
- Not Seol Hyun.
- No, we can't.


594
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:40,508
[Jong Kook, are you going
to fight against me?]


595
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,807
[This drives me nuts.]


596
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,048
[What should I do now?]


597
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:51,557
[Give me your hand, Jong Kook.]


598
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:55,627
But, he does what she says.


599
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,528
Just push her if you're
not going to date her.


600
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,788
It's not that.


601
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:05,278
[Seol Hyun tamed Tiger in one second.]


602
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,067
[Conflict]


603
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:15,877
[No, I fell!]
What are you doing?


604
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,448
[We won!]


605
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:20,417
[All upset!]


606
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,817
I tripped!


607
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,958
It's been such a long time!


608
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,917
[Could Jong Kook be X-man?]


609
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:31,157
[How could Mr. Capable
fail so easily?]


610
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,498
Come out!


611
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:36,008
Bring it on!
[I don't care who she it.]


612
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:39,667
[Smile]
["Hello, Jung Nam!"]


613
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:41,807
[What do I do?]


614
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:44,508
[The smile of an Uncle.]
He won't attack her, will he?


615
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:49,748
[Heart attack...
I can't look her in the eyes.]


616
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:51,607
Look her in the eyes.


617
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,218
Jung Nam, don't fall for her!


618
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,988
[Seol Hyun slowly pulls him to her side.]


619
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:02,157
[At that moment,
Kwang Soo's sudden attack!]


620
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,127
[Holding his leg]


621
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:07,357
[Flop]


622
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:10,768
[She out him easily.]


623
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:15,367
[With Seol Hyun's beauty,
they eliminated two men!]


624
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,567
[Turbo Brothers lost too easily.]


625
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:20,127
We don't know how strong iKON is.


626
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:25,407
Andy, show the power of Shinhwa.


627
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,147
[Andy is really strong.]


628
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,548
[Andy of Shinhwa vs. iKON B.I]


629
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,188
[Tight]
[It's neck and neck.]


630
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:40,837
[B.I grabbed the
opportunity and attacks.]


631
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:42,837
[Andy uses the strength of B.I!]


632
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,097
[B.I was pulled inside Team Kim.]


633
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:51,667
[Chaos]


634
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:56,877
[Many Team Kim members
are out in the middle of chaos.]


635
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:59,147
[Only Andy survived.]


636
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:03,417
[Andy tried to hold it out,
but out.]


637
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:07,847
[Team Ji wins by chance.]


638
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:10,898
[Team Kim vs. Team Ji]
[0:1]


639
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,748
We lost too easily, didn't we?


640
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,498
Why do you think we lost too easily?


641
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,257
It's all because of you!


642
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,467
She didn't say much back then.


643
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,038
I'm surprised, Chae Yeon's changed!


644
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:26,697
[By the way...]


645
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,657
Everyone suspects you
for being the X-man.


646
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:31,987
No, I'm not.
I'm not X-man.


647
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,637
Aren't you that?
R-kong or something.


648
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:37,717
[It's not R-kong, it's R-man.]


649
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:40,518
[Embarrassed]
It's not, R-kong, but R-man.


650
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:43,887
Don't put up Seol Hyun first.


651
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,458
[The more I think about it,
the more suspicious he is.]


652
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:52,628
[She pulled him slightly,
and he's out...]


653
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:55,097
[And he even rolls down by himself.]


654
00:34:55,898 --> 00:35:00,597
[Kkuk and Jung Nam are suspicious!]


655
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,737
We'll start the second round now.


656
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,478
[Go fight, second round!]


657
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,648
[This time, Young Blood
Bobby comes forward.]


658
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,648
[Roar]


659
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:12,217
[Relaxed]


660
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:14,547
[Nervous]


661
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:17,217
People at the back, watch out!


662
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,458
Bobby, we've tried that before...


663
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,628
[Dash!]
[He fell!]


664
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:26,398
[But, Kkuk fell, too!]


665
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:29,367
[By sacrificing himself,
they got Mr. Capable out.]


666
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:34,498
[Full scale war between
Eagle Eye and Giraffe.]


667
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,507
[His eye shake so fast!]


668
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:43,248
Are you okay?
How many fingers?


669
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:44,978
Three, I'm fine.


670
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:48,847
[No matter what Kwang Soo does,
he looks so clumsy.]


671
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,918
[Andy's sudden attack!]
[He pulls Kwang Soo's arm.]


672
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:01,097
[Kwang Soo and Ha Ha were
tangled and out together.]


673
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,327
Wait a moment!


674
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:08,458
[Other runners fall one by one.]


675
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,987
[Both teams have a man and two women.]


676
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:14,168
[Hyper]
Calm down!


677
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:18,777
Both teams have a male runner
and three female runners.


678
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,748
[It's the same, but
they look very different.]


679
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,367
Seol Hyun, you go first.


680
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,728
[He even pushes Seol Hyun.]


681
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,358
[Again, Seol Hyun's eye attack?]


682
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,358
[He staggered.]


683
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,097
[He comes to himself
and tosses her to the female players.]


684
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:37,608
[She's out like that.]


685
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:39,097
[Thrown]


686
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,547
[Oh, no!
I can't believe Seol Hyun is thrown!]


687
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,737
[Thrown to the floor]


688
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:46,878
[Big-nose can't turn back now.]


689
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:48,588
[Charge!]


690
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:54,277
[Huh?
He's out so naturally and easily!]


691
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,217
[Big-nosed Brother is suspicious, too.]


692
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,617
[Ace Song Ji Hyo
doesn't hesitate to attack.]


693
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,257
[She's out with
Stephanie and Chae Yeon.]


694
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:14,867
[Team Ji's only survivor is Kim Ji Min.]


695
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,297
[Sympathy...]


696
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,938
[lie down flat]


697
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:31,077
[She struggles, but out.]


698
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:34,637
That makes Team Kim the winner!


699
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:38,788
[Team Kim vs. Team Ji]
[1:1]


700
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:41,498
It's one to one now!


701
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:44,188
Do you want to have men's game?


702
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:47,097
Okay, we'll have a men's battle.


703
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,927
[Five on five]


704
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:52,387
<i>I'll walk over you like a cat.</i>


705
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,327
<i>And take them down easy!</i>


706
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,387
Good luck, Team Ji!


707
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:58,737
[Cute and lively]


708
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,577
[They're refreshed!]


709
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:03,208
Even the opponent looks refreshed.


710
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,878
[We gained strength.]


711
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:07,248
Thank you, Seol Hyun.


712
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:08,887
That was nice!


713
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,117
Ready!


714
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:12,018
[On the cheers]


715
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:15,157
[the third round of Go fight starts!]


716
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:16,628
Look!


717
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,427
Why don't Jong Kook and
Jong Soo use only one arm?


718
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,367
Let's play fair even if we have to lose.


719
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,998
Sure, I'll use one arm.


720
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,938
We'll use both arms.


721
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:31,538
- That's better, right?
- Yes.


722
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,057
[It feels like they tricked me.]


723
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:38,047
[No plans, no tactics!]
[We'll charge now!]


724
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:42,748
[The battle is on!]


725
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:48,657
[Kim Jung Nam and Ji Suk Jin are out.]


726
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:51,358
[Even Gary's out.]


727
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,128
[Currently, Team Kim has four players,
and Team Ji has three.]


728
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,697
[Mad house]


729
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,367
[Andy, Bobby, and B.I are out.]


730
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,807
[Andy and Jong Soo versus
Kwang Soo.]


731
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:11,447
[Giraffe falls like a paper.]


732
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:20,188
One, two, three!


733
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:22,208
[I should've been out earlier.]


734
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:25,057
[I'm suffering like this,
because I'm the last one...]


735
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:27,998
[Team Kim wins the
third round of Go fight.]


736
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,898
X-man is among that team.


737
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,898
No, I think it's Jong Kook.


738
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,898
It seems he's X-man.


739
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,867
So many look suspicious.


740
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:43,777
The first game, Go fight's
winner is Team Kim.


741
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:49,077
[Who do you think X-man is?]
Jong Kook?


742
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:51,788
He's really strong, you know.


743
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:55,657
But he keeps losing.


744
00:39:55,657 --> 00:40:01,728
Jong Kook is an ace,
but he loses at every game.


745
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:04,498
I think Kim Jong Kook is suspicious.


746
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:08,898
He fell down, when I
pushed him really lightly.


747
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:12,338
So, I think he's suspicious.


748
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:14,367
I think it's Seol Hyun.


749
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,277
When she was pushed


750
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:22,237
she could have grabbed
at least one player.


751
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:25,788
She didn't even try.


752
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:28,547
She didn't resist at all.


753
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,228
[Who will be the X-man
on the special collaboration?]


754
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:41,068
[R-man Lee Kwang Soo appears.]


755
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:43,737
[R-man has to guess
who X-Man is and help.]


756
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:47,068
This is... more difficult
than I thought.


757
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:54,047
As far as I know, Andy's competitive
and strong, too.


758
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,347
He was out easily today.


759
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:59,717
[R-man Lee Kwang Soo decides
to help Andy.]


760
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:06,257
Everyone was waiting for this moment.


761
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:13,057
This game represents X-man,
"Say of course" game!


762
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:14,768
[Say, of course!]


763
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:16,898
<i>You aged while I was away.</i>


764
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:18,538
<i>Of course!</i>


765
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:22,208
<i>[There have been harsh
and revealing words!]</i>


766
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:24,208
<i>Of course!</i>


767
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,648
<i>[No matter what your opponent says
you have to say "of course!"</i>


768
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:31,347
[You'll lose If you can't answer
or get angry.]


769
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:36,617
First, we have the Queen of the game.


770
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:43,387
Why don't Ji Hyun and Jong Kook
show us how to play the game?


771
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:44,827
[It's a practice round.]


772
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:47,257
I'll sacrifice...


773
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,297
I can't believe I can actually see it.


774
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:53,438
It's been such a long time.


775
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:55,608
They used to divide the screen.


776
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:58,677
I'm facing Jong Kook?
It feels like a dream.


777
00:41:58,677 --> 00:41:59,978
Me, too.


778
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,807
I see Ha Ha over there.
He was at the same spot.


779
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:04,208
Jong Soo was there, too.


780
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,297
Looking at this side.
Everyone was there.


781
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:09,288
I was in the army that time,
and we used to curse at you.


782
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:12,088
[Upset]


783
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:14,188
Women think he's romantic.


784
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,788
But, he was kind of gross.


785
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:19,157
[The scene that made the
soldier Kwang Soo feel gross.]


786
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:21,128
<i>Do you like Eun Hye?</i>


787
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:23,427
<i>Do you hate her?</i>


788
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:27,668
<i>[Kkuk had to say "of course"
to win the game.]</i>


789
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:31,967
<i>[He walks to her and
carefully covers her ears.]</i>


790
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,438
<i>Of course!</i>


791
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:42,077
<i>[It was one of the
best scenes of X-man.]</i>


792
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:43,818
Hand off!
With your dirty hands!


793
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:47,588
We were so upset!


794
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:50,657
[Embarrassed]
Let's start the game now!


795
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:53,057
It's been a long time!


796
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,498
Starting with Kim Jong Kook.


797
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:57,157
[Lee Ji Hyun vs. Kim Jong Kook]


798
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,527
Are you happy with your married life?


799
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:00,737
[Hesitate]


800
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:03,268
She can't answer to that?


801
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:05,708
[Everyone's surprise]


802
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:10,338
I was just greeting.
[It turned out to be a sticky question?]


803
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,507
Of course.


804
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,518
If she answered three seconds later,
she could've lost.


805
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,987
I thought this was easy to answer.


806
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:20,887
You should've said
"of course!" right away.


807
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:22,918
When were you filming X-man back then...


808
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:27,657
[She's not going to ask that, is she?]


809
00:43:27,657 --> 00:43:33,228
When were you filming X-man back then,
you were dating Yoon Eun Hye, right?


810
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,387
[You were actually dating
Yoon Eun Hye, right?]


811
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,568
[Embarrassed]


812
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:41,367
Finally, she asked that!


813
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:44,237
I was curious!
[For the past ten years!]


814
00:43:44,237 --> 00:43:48,248
[And... the man couldn't answer.]


815
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:53,438
[The romantic scene made
our hearts flutter.]


816
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:57,358
[Finally, the truth reveals today!]


817
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,688
What's your answer?


818
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:03,697
Finally, it's time!


819
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,027
Answer me, truthfully!


820
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:10,938
There was a news article about this.


821
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,697
I'm so curious!


822
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,538
Please, edit this out!


823
00:44:14,538 --> 00:44:15,608
[Too bad...]


824
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:18,737
You shouldn't ask this question.
This question makes me fall.


825
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:21,347
- But, you weren't falling.
- I didn't, but you didn't hold me.


826
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:24,478
Actually, Ji Hyun almost fell.


827
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,547
With your question.


828
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:30,367
The Queen of Of Course,
almost collapsed.


829
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,657
You need to hold me.


830
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:34,188
Applause for these two.


831
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:37,697
[That was harsh.]


832
00:44:37,697 --> 00:44:40,458
[Nervous]
It's deadly!


833
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:43,128
A long time has passed,
so I wasn't sure.


834
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,438
- But it's still shocking.
- I have a spasm.


835
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:48,467
Who's the first player?


836
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:51,507
- A girl should go.
- Jin Sook should go.


837
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,648
Chae Yeon!
[She's like a shy girl.]


838
00:44:55,608 --> 00:44:58,617
[Team Ji's new face]
Ji Min!


839
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:01,588
This won't be easy.


840
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:03,818
- It's a big match.
- I'm expecting a lot.


841
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:08,318
First, Ji Min will start.


842
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:09,458
[Chae Yeon vs. Kim Ji Min]


843
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,987
I kept watching you
since I arrived here.


844
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:18,228
You know your foundation
creased in your wrinkles?


845
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:20,898
[Wrinkle attack]


846
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:25,268
[She's so harsh!]


847
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:26,737
Suck it up!


848
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:29,807
[Not yet!]
She almost lost.


849
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:33,447
[It was expected,
but the impact was very big.]


850
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,047
I knew she would say that.


851
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:38,918
Of course, I'm fine.
I can suck it up.


852
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:45,427
You... you...
you...


853
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:48,398
- She's embarrassed.
- Her face turned red!


854
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:51,628
I'm not going to laugh.
You...


855
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:53,297
You'll lose if you laugh.


856
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:56,438
Did you stop growing
when you were in elementary?


857
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:58,068
Of course.
[She doesn't care.]


858
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:59,608
Maybe she did.


859
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:02,338
You...


860
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:07,378
A young guy to you would
be in his thirties?


861
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:10,248
[Straightforward!]


862
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,588
[About to cry]


863
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:15,987
[I thought dissing
between rappers were harsh...]


864
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:18,188
Just give up!


865
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:22,358
Can you still play?


866
00:46:23,257 --> 00:46:25,327
[She's changed!]


867
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,467
She's resilient!


868
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:28,867
Isn't this powerful enough?


869
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,867
She would've given up.


870
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:34,237
She's stronger now.


871
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:37,737
You... got your outfit


872
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:40,748
from the children's section right?


873
00:46:40,748 --> 00:46:42,748
That wasn't bad!


874
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:44,918
Of course!


875
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,518
She's so cool about it!


876
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:48,217
You go to the children's store.


877
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:54,958
If you had married earlier,
your son would've been in university.


878
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,697
[She could've been a parent.]


879
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:01,068
This won't do.


880
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,168
Kim Ji Min wins!


881
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:09,208
How can you attack me for my age!


882
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:11,137
[I'm sorry, Chae Yeon.]


883
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,807
She could hold for the second time.


884
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:15,907
She was doing a good job.


885
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:17,818
Ji Min is so strong.


886
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:19,648
Ji Min is a new queen.


887
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,088
Jong Soo!


888
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,518
[Glaring Eagle Eye, Lee Jong Soo]


889
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:25,617
I don't really know him well.


890
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:28,057
If you have nothing,
just seduce her.


891
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:30,498
[Seducing while playing "of course"?]


892
00:47:31,427 --> 00:47:33,568
<i>You know you can't do
anything without me?</i>


893
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:35,527
<i>I have a crush on you, Ji Young.</i>


894
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:38,637
<i>- You know what I'm doing right now?
- I don't know.</i>


895
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:40,137
<i>I'm thinking about you.</i>


896
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:43,878
[Lee Jong Soo fascinated countless
women with his glaring eyes.]


897
00:47:44,677 --> 00:47:47,307
[Will his glaring still work?]


898
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:50,777
It's been 10 years.
My heart is pounding.


899
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:53,347
But, I'm not sure it's because
it's been a long time


900
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:56,588
or because I see Ji Min.


901
00:47:56,588 --> 00:47:57,757
[Surprised]


902
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:01,327
It's on!


903
00:48:03,057 --> 00:48:05,757
[Eagle Eye is alive!]


904
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,597
He's not dead yet.


905
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:10,297
It's so awkward!


906
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:11,938
He's greasy like mayonnaise.


907
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:15,208
[Lee Jong Soo vs. Kim Ji Min]


908
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,208
What you just said...


909
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:21,307
[She's already...]
It didn't get me going at all.


910
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:25,077
[I'm not excited at all, you know?]


911
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:28,447
[His glaring eyes are counted
as nasty eyes now.]


912
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:31,788
[She's... too strong.]


913
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,057
[He was hitting on her bravely]


914
00:48:35,057 --> 00:48:37,728
[but she's indifferent.]


915
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:40,498
[Is he going to step down like this?]


916
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:45,367
- That's too bad!
- Give him another chance.


917
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:47,498
I've seen this before.


918
00:48:47,498 --> 00:48:49,938
- Then, say "of course."
- Of course.


919
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:54,077
[Blanked out]


920
00:48:54,077 --> 00:48:57,777
- My brain is empty.
- You know your face is so red!


921
00:48:57,777 --> 00:49:02,177
I thought you turned
into a frilled lizard!


922
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,188
- It's so funny.
- I'll do an acrostic poem.


923
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,057
- With Ji Min's name?
- All of a sudden?


924
00:49:07,788 --> 00:49:09,458
- Please say the initial for me.
- Kim.


925
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:10,547
Kim Ji Min!


926
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,748
- Ji.
- Jigeum(now), we'll start dating.


927
00:49:15,438 --> 00:49:18,498
- Min.
- Minmang haji? (Aren't you embarrassed?)


928
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,498
I'm embarrassed!


929
00:49:20,498 --> 00:49:22,438
Of course.


930
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:24,768
[Ji Min will answer.]
Lee Jong Soo!


931
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:26,108
Jong!


932
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:31,208
Jongmal... (actually)
I've been watching you this whole time.


933
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,847
"Jongmal" is close enough to "Jungmal."
It's allowed.


934
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,047
She's been watching him.


935
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:39,617
Soojak burijima.
(Don't even think about it!)


936
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:42,057
[She answers with angry eyes.]


937
00:49:42,057 --> 00:49:44,117
[Eye to an eye!]


938
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:50,458
[Kim Ji Min wins two rounds in a flash.]


939
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,568
Old X-man members!


940
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:55,068
What happened to the original members?


941
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,967
She's the new queen!


942
00:49:57,967 --> 00:49:59,967
I haven't hit on her yet...


943
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:03,438
Take a break for now.
Let Seol Hyun do it.


944
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:05,907
[The hottest idol, Seol Hyun]


945
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:07,677
[Hesitant]


946
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:08,677
No one's daring to play!


947
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:11,148
Who wants to play?


948
00:50:11,148 --> 00:50:12,818
Ha Ha? Andy?


949
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:15,657
[Against Seol Hyun?]
Play, Andy.


950
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:20,288
[To play against, Seol Hyun,
Playboy Ha Ha should.]


951
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:24,358
I'm not sure if Seol Hyun
can take him.


952
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,268
He used to be a playboy back then.


953
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:30,867
Everyone here is witness.


954
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:33,568
[To his wife]
I do this for work.


955
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,108
Ha Ha will start first.
Go, Ha Ha!


956
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:41,257
You've gotten even prettier.


957
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:44,277
Of course.


958
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:49,418
[It's Seol Hyun's turn.]


959
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:51,958
You...


960
00:50:55,157 --> 00:50:58,327
are shorter than me, right?


961
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:03,197
[You're shorter than me, right?]


962
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:06,438
It is true!


963
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,938
[Seol Hyun, did you have to do that?]
Let him take a break!


964
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:12,438
[With her angelic smile,
she's being straightforward!]


965
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:14,137
[Everyone turns like this here.]


966
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:17,407
[Let Ha Ha take a break.]
Andy should go.


967
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,648
[Everlasting pretty boy, Andy]


968
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:21,177
Seol Hyun's doing well!


969
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:23,788
Why do you have so many weaknesses?


970
00:51:23,788 --> 00:51:27,418
Try, Andy.
You should feel it.


971
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,657
You hear that from
someone nice and pretty.


972
00:51:30,657 --> 00:51:33,358
- It's okay.
- It's Andy vs. Seol Hyun.


973
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,228
- I'll finish it now.
- Are you sure?


974
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:37,668
Can he finish now?


975
00:51:37,668 --> 00:51:39,597
She won't be able to say yes to this.


976
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,597
Will you marry me?


977
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:49,447
[Will you marry me?]


978
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,077
Just marry him.


979
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:57,188
[You mean, marriage?]


980
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:01,157
If you say yes,
you have to marry him.


981
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:03,487
It's just a game!


982
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,297
[His proposal turned
both teams upside down.]


983
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:10,068
Seol Hyun!


984
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:12,467
You should answer it properly!


985
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:19,108
[No one can answer
to that question easily...]


986
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:20,838
Of course!


987
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,407
[It's a good news!]


988
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,947
[Congratulations on Andy
and Seol Hyun's marriage!]


989
00:52:26,947 --> 00:52:28,648
I'm finally getting married!


990
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:30,518
That's too bad...


991
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:32,217
Do you want to have a drink with me?


992
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:35,518
They even tossed him in the air,
even though it's a game.


993
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:36,887
She still said "of course."


994
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:41,527
[The two who agreed to get married.]


995
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,728
Let's get a divorce!


996
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,967
[Let's get a divorce!]


997
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:51,907
[A bolt out of the blue]


998
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:56,277
[Their short marriage life's ended.]


999
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:00,577
[She's brilliant!]


1000
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:04,148
[Team Kim vs. Team Ji]
[0:3]


1001
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,387
[Dizzy, dizzy]


1002
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:10,418
Who didn't play this game yet?


1003
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,557
- B.I didn't play.
- B.I!


1004
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,887
[iKON's leader, B.I]
From Team Kim?


1005
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:17,797
Stephanie!


1006
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:19,628
It looks like B.I can play it well.


1007
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:22,297
I don't really know him.
What do I do?


1008
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:23,898
B.I will start.


1009
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:27,407
You know, I don't really
know you, either.


1010
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:30,307
[Shocked]


1011
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,277
[She's losing her mind.]


1012
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:37,447
[They never expected it from B.I,
but so happy to see it.]


1013
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:42,617
[He's shown his talent
for variety shows.]


1014
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:44,188
Actually...


1015
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:46,688
Fannie's face turned red.


1016
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:48,387
Of course.


1017
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:51,257
[It's Stephanie's turn.]


1018
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:54,467
Only your name is English, right?


1019
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,268
- Of course.
- What's your real name?


1020
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:58,697
- Kim Han Bin.
- It's a cool name.


1021
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:02,467
What's B.I?
What does it stand for?


1022
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:04,438
I've never been to the States.


1023
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:06,307
[Oh... right.]


1024
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:09,447
[Every single word is like an attack.]


1025
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,478
Many drops make a flood.


1026
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:12,847
B.I's turn.


1027
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,088
I don't know if this is okay...


1028
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,648
- he helped me with this me.
- Say it.


1029
00:54:16,648 --> 00:54:20,927
If you're Stephanie, are you ttang Fani?
(digging the ground)


1030
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,887
[What was that?]


1031
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:24,257
It wasn't my idea.


1032
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,697
- I'm warning you.
- It's just an attack.


1033
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,728
[It rhymes, though.]


1034
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:30,268
Of course.


1035
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:36,938
If you're B.I,
are your underpants B.I.C?


1036
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:40,907
[With an old brand name
of underwear, Stephanie wins.]


1037
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:43,677
It's fine, it's fine!


1038
00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:44,807
[That's how it is?]

1045
00:55:03,998 --> 00:55:06,597

1046
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:10,918
[I'm the Queen of "Of Course Game!"]


1047
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:13,097
[After 10 years away,
her new target is...]


1048
00:55:13,097 --> 00:55:14,737
Lee Kwang Soo!


1049
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:17,077
[How good will the game be today?]


1050
00:55:17,077 --> 00:55:20,318
He can say harsh things.


1051
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:21,677
Yes, he's incredible.


1052
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:24,818
Among the Running Man members,
Kwang Soo is the best player for this.


1053
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:28,458
But, Kwang Soo falls in love easily.


1054
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,527
- You want to start first?
- Yes.


1055
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,277
[Lee Ji Hyun vs. Lee Kang Soo]


1056
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:37,057
I wonder... if you know
you're prettier... May I ask?


1057
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:39,867
[That's not how you play.]


1058
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,277
You should drop the honorifics.


1059
00:55:42,277 --> 00:55:43,657
It's the rule for the game.


1060
00:55:45,168 --> 00:55:48,007
- Did know, you're prettier on TV?
- Yes, I know that.


1061
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,547
Of course!


1062
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,347
You're doing good!


1063
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:53,777
She's so reliable.


1064
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:56,378
She looks like an old sister
who came to avenge.


1065
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:59,927
[With her warm smile]


1066
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:03,588
[will she start attacking now?]


1067
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:07,657
Not too long ago, you made a movie
in a fish costume, right?


1068
00:56:09,257 --> 00:56:11,228
[You mean... this?]


1069
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:15,237
I heard you're practicing for
the next movie as a turtle?


1070
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,467
[Will his next movie be
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"?]


1071
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:23,608
[It's funny but sad...]


1072
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:26,608
[She's very sharp.]


1073
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,677
[It seems he's hurt.]


1074
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,018
It's okay.


1075
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:33,018
You can do it.


1076
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:35,148
It's fine.
Wake up!


1077
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:37,657
She teats my heart!


1078
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:40,288
[Maybe I was too harsh
from the beginning?]


1079
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:45,867
Three, two...
[If he can't admit it, he'll lose.]


1080
00:56:46,728 --> 00:56:48,498
Of c...


1081
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:54,338
- Who do we have now?
- It's four to four.


1082
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:55,538
Four to four?


1083
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,038
This is the last match!


1084
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,807
Gary didn't play.


1085
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:01,378
[Running Man's rhapsodist, Gary!]


1086
00:57:02,148 --> 00:57:04,677
They have ha Ha.


1087
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:07,288
Ha Ha was taking a break.


1088
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:10,288
[Running Man's two rivals battle!]


1089
00:57:11,588 --> 00:57:13,277
[They're close, but
they don't get along.]


1090
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:15,927
[Bickering, they've fought so much!]


1091
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,728
[More than anything, they get upset
when they lose against each other.]


1092
00:57:20,297 --> 00:57:23,197
<i>It's so upsetting
to lose against him!</i>


1093
00:57:23,197 --> 00:57:27,467
[It's time to settle!]


1094
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:30,137
What a big match!


1095
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:31,538
Yes, it's a big match!


1096
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:34,177
As you said...


1097
00:57:34,177 --> 00:57:38,648
They're the rivals of Running Man.


1098
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:41,588
They're real rivals.


1099
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:44,088
I don't even want to see his face.


1100
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:46,057
It's getting funny already.


1101
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:49,128
You start, Ha Ha.


1102
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:50,438
[Ha Ha vs. Gary]

[He's going to attack my appearance.]


1105
00:57:57,608 --> 00:58:01,568
- You were standing next to B.I...
- I'm laughing already.


1106
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:03,547
- I see, I see.
- Let me ask you this.


1107
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:07,307
Are you a squid?
(Squid became a byword for being ugly.)


1108
00:58:10,577 --> 00:58:13,378
[Gae... quid?]


1109
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:19,057
[Laugh]


1110
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:22,288
Gary, you're not a squid!


1111
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:24,527
It's okay, Gary!


1112
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:26,827
[He kind of looks like a squid.]


1113
00:58:26,827 --> 00:58:29,498
Can you play the music?


1114
00:58:30,728 --> 00:58:32,197
[I like it!]


1115
00:58:33,097 --> 00:58:35,878
[When you're upset and annoyed]


1116
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:39,108
[let's dance to "I like it!"]


1117
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:40,438
It's okay, it's fine.


1118
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:43,577
I haven't requested this music
in such a long time!


1119
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:45,608
I'm sorry, but it was too funny.


1120
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:47,277
Wasn't it funny?


1121
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:50,367
[Even the queen keeps laughing.]
They can't stop laughing.


1122
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,458
Why are you laughing so hard?


1123
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,887
[Because I imagined.]


1124
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:56,987
I feel shameful for myself.


1125
00:58:56,987 --> 00:59:00,858
Because, I keep trying to
put my hand in the pocket.


1126
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:02,338
[He forgot his pants are inside out.]


1127
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:05,467
I keep doing this.


1128
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:09,297
The squid was too harsh!


1129
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:13,268
It's fine.
[Will Gary be able to attack him back?]


1130
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:15,378
Squids are beautiful looking!


1131
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:17,648
It's fine.


1132
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:21,818
The woman you really like,
isn't Byul, is it?


1133
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,047
She's Go Eun.
Of course!


1134
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:25,648
This upsets me!


1135
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:27,217
I get upset when he does that!


1136
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,688
- Don't do that.
- Or everyone.


1137
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:32,088
Don't add any explanations!


1138
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,887
- He said, everyone.
- I warned you!


1139
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:37,498
You... Squid!


1140
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:43,137

[I like it!]


1144
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,847
I saved you.


1145
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:56,418
Suck it up, we need to win.


1146
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:59,088
- Are we tied?
- Hey, you!


1147
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:01,717
[Upsetting]


1148
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,217
[He can make Gary frustrated.]


1149
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:07,157
What's he doing?


1150
01:00:07,157 --> 01:00:08,728
Anteater.


1151
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:12,927
Your house... is in Noryangjin, right?


1152
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:17,268
[Noryangjin Fish Market?]
Are you talking about the fish market?


1153
01:00:17,268 --> 01:00:19,097
Yes, of course!


1154
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:23,978
Of course, he's a squid.


1155
01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:28,547
[Everyone's laughing except Gary.]
Would a squid live in Gangnam?


1156
01:00:28,547 --> 01:00:30,847
Because of the squid...


1157
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,748
That's too powerful.


1158
01:00:32,748 --> 01:00:35,717
[Blank Ji helps him.]


1159
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,358
Only Ji Hyo helps Gary.


1160
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:39,518
They're Mung Gae.
(Sounds like sea squirt)


1161
01:00:39,518 --> 01:00:41,128
Gary?


1162
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:45,757
- You think you're the god of reggae?
- Of course!


1163
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:47,628
I hate it!


1164
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:49,568
He doesn't hesitate at all.


1165
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:50,998
He sounds like he really admits it.


1166
01:00:50,998 --> 01:00:53,237
[It's time to end now.]


1167
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:55,507
Let's make a cool ending.


1168
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:57,677
Just finish him now.


1169
01:00:57,677 --> 01:01:00,978
Are you actually dating Song Ji Hyo?


1170
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,248
[Hot issue]
Many people want to know.


1171
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:11,717
[If X-man had the "Of Course Couple,"
Running Man has the "Monday Couple."]


1172
01:01:13,918 --> 01:01:16,228
<i>What are you hinting at?</i>


1173
01:01:16,228 --> 01:01:18,597
<i>[Five years ago,
they met for the first time.]</i>


1174
01:01:18,597 --> 01:01:20,898

1175
01:01:20,898 --> 01:01:23,697
<i>[they build memories together.]</i>


1176

<i>[Little by little]</i>


1177

<i>[they become close to each other.]</i>


1178

<i>[On Mondays, Gary's been
dedicated to Ji Hyo.]</i>


1179
01:01:32,907 --> 01:01:36,307
<i>[But Seol Hyun came like spring breeze.]</i>


1180
01:01:36,307 --> 01:01:39,847
<i>[In short, his feeling for
their first meeting was]</i>


1181
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:42,148
<i>heart attack!</i>


1182
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:48,818
[He'll tell the truth,
when the two women are present.]


1183
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:54,057
[Finally...]


1184
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:58,927
[he makes a move!]


1185
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:05,137
[Will he admit that he's seeing Ji Hyo?]


1186
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:09,637
[In front of Seol Hyun?]


1187
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:18,818
Of course!


1188
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,157
[Burst of laughter]


1189
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:27,657
[This looks so familiar!]


1190

[He parodies Kkuk.]


1191
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:37,967
[Just tell me you've
always wanted to do it.]


1192
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:42,188
There's someone
who shouldn't listen!


1193
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:44,838
Someone shouldn't listen!


1194
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:49,148
Why did you cover
Seol Hyun's ears?


1195
01:02:49,148 --> 01:02:51,518
Why cover Seol Hyun's ears?


1196
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,887
Good job!


1197
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,188
[I didn't see that coming,
but thank you Ha Ha.]


1198
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:58,557
- We get to see that in ten years.
- It's a remake!


1199
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:06,068
Do you... honestly like


1200
01:03:06,068 --> 01:03:10,367
- that program more than "Running Man"?
- You can say it, "Infinite Challenge."


1201
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:12,907
Do you like "Infinity Challenge"
more than "Running Man"?


1202
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:15,737
Is that real?
[The viewers are watching!]


1203
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:19,038
[Running Man members
are right in front of him.]


1204

Is that real?


1205
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:24,648
[Is he walking away like this?]


1206
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:32,288
Of course!


1207
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:40,597
Did you plan for this?


1208
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:42,867
That was incredible!


1209
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:45,538
[What just happened?]


1210
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:48,007
[It's shocking!]


1211
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:50,807
We could even do it for men.


1212
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,677
This actually happens while filming.


1213
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:58,117
Funny things happened during this game.


1214
01:03:58,117 --> 01:04:00,117
Did you have to do that?


1215
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:03,947
Squid!


1216
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:06,018
If you go out and get some air...


1217
01:04:06,878 --> 01:04:11,858
you'll become a dried squid.
You know that?


1218
01:04:13,038 --> 01:04:17,668
[It's the best bar snack!
Dried Gae... quid?]


1219
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,737
[Come over here!]


1220
01:04:23,737 --> 01:04:25,378
Ha Ha wins!


1221
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:28,947
See you at my house!


1222
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:31,447
We'll play this again!
[The rivals' match isn't over...]


1223
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:36,438
Therefore, Team Kim wins the game!


1224
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:39,788
["Say, of course," 5 to 4]
[Team Kim wins.]


1225
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:43,358
It's so funny.


1226
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:45,987
You've been waiting a lot.
Finally, it's the time!


1227
01:04:45,987 --> 01:04:52,097
The air gets romantic
during this session.


1228
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:57,268
"Couples and Warriors Forever!"


1229
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:02,407
I'm sorry, are you a bandit?


1230
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:05,507
I need to show off my charms today.


1231
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,588
So, I'm wearing fashionable clothes.


1232
01:05:07,588 --> 01:05:09,947
That's too much.


1233
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:15,288
[Chae Yeon looks exactly
the same as 10 years ago.]


1234
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:19,188
[I'm the queen of fashion!]


1235
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:20,927
[You are... the same.]
She's pretty.


1236
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:23,527
- I think Seol Hyun is X-man.
- Me, too.


1237
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:27,297
- Me, too.
- That's what I was worried about.


1238
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:29,398
I'm really bad at playing games.


1239
01:05:29,398 --> 01:05:32,307
Really, I suck at games,
and I'm weak.


1240
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:35,208
She played against me,
but she's not bad.


1241
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,978
Then, she's either X-man or R-man.


1242
01:05:37,978 --> 01:05:40,148
I don't know who X-man is.


1243
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:44,617
- I don't know.
- You forget while you play games.


1244
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:46,947
We all forget about it.


1245
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:49,358
Exactly.


1246
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:50,788
At first, we pay attention


1247
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:53,657
- but then we totally forget.
- We think about it at the end again.


1248
01:05:54,557 --> 01:05:56,458
[More than anyone, I
need to find X-man...]


1249
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,927
It must be awkward for you,
since you never did this before.


1250
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:03,068
Gary, Kwang Soo and I...


1251
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:06,407
If there's hell,
I think it's here.


1252
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:09,277
[In between handsome men,
there's a squid hell.]


1253
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:11,208
I worry about this team.


1254
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:15,217
I see three beautiful ladies


1255
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:19,387
but everyone might
want one specific person.


1256
01:06:19,387 --> 01:06:22,887
It'll be really competitive.


1257
01:06:22,887 --> 01:06:24,757
I think it'll be a mud fight!


1258
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:27,387
I can see that already.


1259
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:29,228
[Scared]


1260
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:31,927
Ji Min, Song Ji Hyo, and Seol Hyun


1261
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:35,568
they are all nice ladies.


1262
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:37,438
I'm confused.


1263
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:40,737
Ji Suk Jin, show your charms!


1264
01:06:41,637 --> 01:06:46,007
Let me ask if there's a person
you want to be a couple and play games?


1265
01:06:46,007 --> 01:06:47,577
Of course!


1266
01:06:47,577 --> 01:06:53,387
Since long time ago, I saw her on TV.
I think she's my type.


1267
01:06:53,387 --> 01:06:55,657
You're type?


1268
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:59,407
You need to show your heart here,
so they will think about it.


1269
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:03,967
I have only one person in mind
and I'll show it.


1270
01:07:03,967 --> 01:07:06,967
She's not Ji Hyo, is she?


1271
01:07:06,967 --> 01:07:08,797
[Who's Suk Jin's ideal type?]


1272
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:11,297
[Nasty, nasty]


1273
01:07:13,268 --> 01:07:18,907
[He approaches to Seol Hyun first.]


1274
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:26,447
[Then, walks to Ji Min.]


1275
01:07:30,188 --> 01:07:33,018
[Then, he glanced at Ji Hyo.]


1276
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:37,677
<i>It's so hot, it's so hot!</i>


1277
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:41,398
<i>My heart burns because of you!</i>


1278
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:45,367
[Big-nosed Brother sings
enthusiastically.]


1279
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,708
I can't see that, Director!


1280
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:58,608
[He doesn't know the lyrics,
so he has a cheat sheet.]


1281
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,387
[The cheat sheet is moving.]


1282
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:09,827
[Big-nose follows the cheat sheet.]


1283
01:08:14,677 --> 01:08:16,898
<i>You're inside of me!</i>


1284
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:19,698
[Suk Jin's ideal type is Ji Hyo?]


1285
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:22,768
[She hates it.]


1286
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:26,377
Is that Ji Hyo's picture?


1287
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:28,307
[Uncomfortable]


1288
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:30,188
[Ji Hyo, you know how I feel?]


1289
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:32,207
[Unlucky]


1290
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,717
[Lucky]


1291
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:36,677
[The song is reaching it's climax.]


1292
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:46,858
[Although he doesn't know the lyrics,
he knows the heart of a woman.]


1293
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:51,387
[He slowly walks to Ji Hyo]


1294
01:08:51,387 --> 01:08:55,738
[and appeals to Ji Hyo at the end.]


1295
01:08:57,368 --> 01:08:59,467
Applause for Suk Jin!


1296
01:08:59,467 --> 01:09:01,858
Ji Hyo is his ideal type?


1297
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:04,127
The funny thing about Suk Jin is...


1298
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,207
whenever we have new guests,
he shows interests.


1299
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:10,127
But when it comes to pick a couple,
he always picks Ji Hyo.


1300
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:12,188
I know, right?


1301
01:09:12,188 --> 01:09:16,238
B.I will keep up the heat!


1302
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,658
What did you prepare, B.I?


1303
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:21,007
I'll dance.


1304
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:24,057
[Oh, no!
I'll dance, too.]


1305
01:09:24,057 --> 01:09:26,078
Let's see B.I's dance!
Start the music!


1306
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,337
[2005 style subtitle]
[B.I makes a sortie.]


1307
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:32,207
[Looking forward]
He's warming up.


1308
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:38,148
[He stretches in style.]


1309
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:47,847
[His charisma blows
up everyone's heart!]


1310
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:52,278
What was that?


1311
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:55,057
[Splendid!]


1312
01:09:59,597 --> 01:10:02,828
[The innate ability to dance!]


1313
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,938
[Please take my heart!]


1314
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:12,078
[B.I is desperately heading to...]


1315
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:15,148
[Ji Hyo!]


1316
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:20,818
[Right in front of her,
he aggressively appeals to Ji Hyo.]


1317
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:24,787
[What is he doing?]


1318
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,257
[Wave]


1319
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,087
[I'll fail...]


1320
01:10:31,637 --> 01:10:33,097
[Grabs her shoulders]


1321
01:10:33,097 --> 01:10:37,167
[we'll leave for love...]


1322
01:10:38,997 --> 01:10:43,307
Continuously!


1323
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,677
[Gary's move!]


1324
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:50,177
[As soon as he starts,
people laugh hard.]


1325
01:10:50,177 --> 01:10:51,818
[Flop]


1326
01:10:54,347 --> 01:10:57,318
[He tries to break dance!]


1327
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:58,988
[Fall]


1328
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:03,097
[Oh, no...
The years rolled by...]


1329
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:04,528
Stop it!


1330
01:11:06,297 --> 01:11:10,148
- That's too bad.
- That's it?


1331
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:14,608
Jae Suk, let him dance as same as B.I!


1332
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,108
I can't do that!


1333
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,978
- Try it, Gary!
- You can do it.


1334
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:20,478
[Gary didn't show
all of his charms yet!]


1335
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:22,137
How did you do that?


1336
01:11:22,137 --> 01:11:25,587
[Gary's trial for B.I's dance!]


1337
01:11:25,587 --> 01:11:28,018
He was doing this before.


1338
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:32,488
[He stretches like B.I first.]


1339
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,618
Seol Hyun smiles!


1340
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:37,528
[Will Gary be able to show
off his charms like B.I?]


1341
01:11:42,057 --> 01:11:45,568
[The Radio Exercise like dance.]


1342
01:11:49,497 --> 01:11:52,438
[He walks to Seol Hyun in samba steps.]


1343
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:54,938
[And the pelvic dance!]


1344
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:59,578
[Is he trying to break dance again?]


1345
01:11:59,578 --> 01:12:00,747
[Flop]


1346
01:12:00,747 --> 01:12:03,887
[That's weird, I used
to do that in 2005.]


1347
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:06,448
[I feel relieved, thanks to you.]


1348
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:08,417
Gary, stop!


1349
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:10,358
I haven't danced for so long!


1350
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:15,898
Please give a round of applause
for B.I and Gary!


1351
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:18,658
I've learned something.
Thank you!


1352
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:20,627
This is the kind of dance
I want to do.


1353
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,837
Why don't you try, Jae Suk?


1354
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:25,337
Please start the music!


1355
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:31,148
Please show me how.


1356
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:33,347
I'll copy him.


1357
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:38,387
Stretch, first.


1358
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:43,057
[I'm starting.]


1359
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:52,597
[How can it be the same?]


1360
01:12:55,268 --> 01:12:58,568
[It's totally different.]


1361
01:12:58,568 --> 01:13:00,438
[His face looks serious.]


1362
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:04,037
[The pelvic dance is similar.]


1363
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,078
I want to hit him!


1364
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:14,377
[B.I's dance will be a hit!]
What was with your face?


1365
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:16,217
I was immersed into the dance.


1366
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:21,257
Next up is Bobby!


1367
01:13:21,257 --> 01:13:24,228
Among three ladies...


1368
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:26,497
there's a person I'm a big fan of.


1369
01:13:26,497 --> 01:13:29,167
I like her.


1370
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:31,667
- I want to confess my heart.
- Oh, my god!


1371
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:33,068
Confess?


1372
01:13:33,068 --> 01:13:36,637
[Who will be the one to
hear Bobby's confession?]


1373
01:13:36,637 --> 01:13:38,137
<i>Excuse me, lady.</i>


1374
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,807
<i>All I want from you is time.</i>


1375
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:45,717
<i>Please rewind the time
to become a girl.</i>


1376
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,648
<i>Don't expect for me to call you sister.</i>


1377
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:51,608
<i>You look a lot younger than me.</i>


1378
01:13:51,608 --> 01:13:54,757
<i>Look at the mirror, Ji Min.</i>


1379
01:13:54,757 --> 01:13:58,297
<i>There are lots of comedians around you.</i>


1380
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:01,658
<i>Making people laugh is your occupation.</i>


1381
01:14:01,658 --> 01:14:05,438
<i>At least today, I want to
make you laugh, Baby!</i>


1382
01:14:05,438 --> 01:14:07,997
<i>Just for a day</i>


1383
01:14:07,997 --> 01:14:11,698
<i>please let me act like a man,
and not a younger brother.</i>


1384
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:17,547
[He impressed her!]


1385
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:19,807
Ji Min's all set.


1386
01:14:19,807 --> 01:14:22,217
Please show us your dance, Bobby!


1387
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:24,247
Please start the music for Bobby!


1388
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:29,427
[Smiling]


1389
01:14:30,427 --> 01:14:32,658
[To win her heart, he dances, too.]


1390
01:14:35,557 --> 01:14:38,068
[The powerful krumping!]


1391
01:14:39,597 --> 01:14:42,738
[From a romantic rapper,
to a manly dancer!]


1392
01:14:44,537 --> 01:14:47,108
[While he's at it,
he shoots out hearts!]


1393
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:52,648
[She's mine!]


1394
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:54,518
[Standing ovation]


1395
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:59,387
[Bobby successfully
showed off his charms!]


1396
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:02,618
[They lost their will to fight.]


1397
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:05,757
[Hooray, Bobby!]


1398
01:15:05,757 --> 01:15:07,658
He's incredible!


1399
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:10,297
Are you ready, Kwang Soo?
[Right after that is Kwang Soo...]


1400
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:13,658
I want to show the serious side of me.


1401
01:15:13,658 --> 01:15:17,097
Kwang Soo's been clumsy
and silly on the show.


1402
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,587
Please show us how gorgeous
you are on the stage.


1403
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:22,438
You will see how he is.


1404
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:25,188
He sings very well, too.


1405
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:26,677
Please play the music!


1406
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,747
What's wrong with him?


1407
01:15:32,747 --> 01:15:34,787
Is he doing pantomime?


1408
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:36,587
I think he's just making it up now.


1409
01:15:36,587 --> 01:15:40,688
[No matter what they say,
I'm very serious now.]


1410
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,127
Such a nice song!


1411
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:44,158
He's good at it!


1412
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:46,328
[I want to express my heart!]


1413
01:15:46,328 --> 01:15:48,667
Is that Ji Hyo?


1414
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:57,328
[Ji Hyo, you know how I feel?]


1415
01:15:57,328 --> 01:15:58,728
[Punch]


1416
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:06,417
[He starts singing as
if nothing happened.]


1417
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:12,188
[He fails to be serious in one minute.]
Your nose is bleeding.


1418
01:16:15,358 --> 01:16:19,858
[This time, he takes off his sweater]


1419
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:22,547
[and gives it to Ji Min.]


1420
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:26,167
[Why are you hitting on me?]


1421
01:16:27,728 --> 01:16:32,707
[The melody sounds even more sad.]


1422
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:40,247
[At that time, Kwang Soo's
secret weapon arrives.]


1423
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:50,627
[The only woman left is Seol Hyun.]


1424
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:55,398
[Please, take my heart.]


1425
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:03,707
[The climax of the song]


1426
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:11,318
<i>The "remories" of
loving you like crazy.</i>


1427
01:17:11,318 --> 01:17:14,717
[He mixed up with "memory"
and "reminiscence."]


1428
01:17:16,018 --> 01:17:20,257
I asked them to make the key lower!


1429
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:22,988
[He can't sing the high notes.]


1430
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:28,297
[He might get a perfect voice today.]


1431
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:37,337
[He wakes up at the end,
and confesses his love.]


1432
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:41,677
[The coat he was going to give Ji Hyo]


1433
01:17:41,677 --> 01:17:46,148
[and the sweater he was
going to give Ji Min]


1434
01:17:49,587 --> 01:17:51,837
Applause for Kwang Soo!


1435
01:17:51,837 --> 01:17:55,587
[The giving tree, Kwang Soo]
Why did you take off your shoes?


1436
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,587
[The men's session is over.]


1437
01:17:57,587 --> 01:18:00,837
Everyone, finally...


1438
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:04,497
it's women's session!


1439
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:06,268
First, Seol Hyun's stage!


1440
01:18:08,608 --> 01:18:10,837
[Looking forward to see]


1441
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:14,177
Play the music!


1442
01:18:16,037 --> 01:18:21,948
[Seol Hyun starts off stretching, too.]


1443
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:25,417
[She walks straight to Kwang Soo.]


1444
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,988
[Seductive]


1445
01:18:28,818 --> 01:18:33,557
[Then, she seduces Gary.]


1446
01:18:35,997 --> 01:18:38,497
[The dance time!]


1447
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:45,568
[Her secret weapon, the red scarf]


1448
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:47,807
[Flashy]


1449
01:18:55,518 --> 01:19:00,287
[After throwing the scarf,
her dance heats up even more.]


1450
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:03,818
[The powerful dance from
the slender figure!]


1451
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:08,658
[She stirs up the stage]


1452
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:12,528
[suddenly walks toward Gary.]
Gary!


1453
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:16,667
[Come on, Gary!]


1454
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:26,408
[The passionate couple dance!]


1455
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:29,948
[Both of them are wearing all black,
what a charming dirty duo!]


1456
01:19:30,478 --> 01:19:32,967
[The only beneficiary of
Seol Hyun's stage is Gary.]


1457
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:34,688
[I sang so hard for you...]


1458
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:36,518
What's wrong, Kwang Soo?


1459
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:39,887
Gary must be happy.
[What's Seol Hyun thinking?]


1460
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:41,457
She's the best!


1461
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:43,057
I'm happy even though I can't be paired.


1462
01:19:44,028 --> 01:19:47,927
[Ji Hyo's session!]
[She danced a lot for the members.]


1463
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:51,797
[But she dances in front of him
for the first time.]


1464
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:56,467
[Cute, cute]


1465
01:19:59,148 --> 01:20:03,257
<i>Physiognomist, isn't that weird?</i>


1466
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:07,408
<i>I'm already a king,
but you said I'd become a king.</i>


1467
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:09,858
Physiognomist!


1468
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:13,337
Isn't that weird?


1469
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:15,158
[It's somewhat similar.]


1470
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:18,757
(Kim Jong Kook's thin and high
voice is referred as whiz.)


1471
01:20:19,797 --> 01:20:21,228
[Upset]


1472
01:20:22,828 --> 01:20:25,698
[Be careful of mosquitoes!]


1473
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:27,497
It sounds exactly like Jong Kook!


1474
01:20:27,497 --> 01:20:29,938
[Approved]


1475
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:31,167
That's it.


1476
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:35,948
[Ji Min showed off her charm.]


1477
01:20:35,948 --> 01:20:37,978
Physiognomist and Kim Jong Kook.


1478
01:20:37,978 --> 01:20:40,877
It's time to choose now.
From Ji Suk Jin.


1479
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:44,387
Do I say it now?


1480
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:47,158
When I count to three,
say her name.


1481
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:48,877
Everyone's heart is fixed.


1482
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,807
And shout "Let's play games together!"


1483
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:52,568
One, two, three!


1484
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:54,948
Ji Hyo...


1485
01:20:54,948 --> 01:20:58,078
Let's play games together!


1486
01:20:58,868 --> 01:21:02,438
[Ji Hyo hated his performance,
did she change her mind?]


1487
01:21:02,438 --> 01:21:06,007
One, two...


1488
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:09,927
[What'll be her answer?]
three!


1489
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:15,478
Play games with Kwang Soo!


1490
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,518
Why are you including me?


1491
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:20,478
[I'm sorry.]


1492
01:21:20,478 --> 01:21:22,887
Next up is B.I!


1493
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:25,587
They're older than me


1494
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:28,207
but, I will drop honorifics.


1495
01:21:28,207 --> 01:21:30,948
Women like that kind of stuff.


1496
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:33,347
- You'll be paired.
- Ji Hyo...


1497
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:36,148
Let's play games together!


1498
01:21:36,148 --> 01:21:38,387
[Flutter, flutter]


1499
01:21:38,387 --> 01:21:42,278
She already set her mind
at the beginning!


1500
01:21:43,037 --> 01:21:46,108
[What's the meaning
behind Ji Hyo's expression?]


1501
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:48,698
Please wait for the countdown.


1502
01:21:48,698 --> 01:21:51,097
Wait for the countdown.


1503
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:54,387
One, two...


1504
01:21:54,387 --> 01:21:56,488
- Yes!
- Wait for three!


1505
01:21:56,488 --> 01:21:59,757
[Please answer after three.]


1506
01:22:00,787 --> 01:22:02,957
I'm slightly upset.


1507
01:22:02,957 --> 01:22:05,007
Aren't you too much?


1508
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:07,268
I like it!


1509
01:22:07,268 --> 01:22:10,368
[Ji Hyo and B.I are a couple.]


1510
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:14,347
Next up is Kang Gary.


1511
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:16,528
- Gary, Kang?
- Seol Hyun!


1512
01:22:16,528 --> 01:22:18,377
Let's play games together!


1513
01:22:18,377 --> 01:22:20,927
[Seol Hyun is smiling?]


1514
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:22,818
[Anticipation]


1515
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,448
[No!]


1516
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:28,677
[What's Seol Hyun's answer?]


1517
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:33,528
Yes!


1518
01:22:34,457 --> 01:22:36,797
[How can this be?]


1519
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:40,148
[Gary and Seol Hyun are a couple.]


1520
01:22:40,148 --> 01:22:42,677
[There's still a chance left
for Kwang Soo.]


1521
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:44,368
And next is Bobby!


1522
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:46,297
Ji Min!


1523
01:22:46,297 --> 01:22:49,608
Two, three...


1524
01:22:49,608 --> 01:22:52,507
Can you read that I'd be
a couple from my face?


1525
01:22:52,507 --> 01:22:56,547
[Bobby and Ji Min are a couple.]


1526
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:58,457
Kwang Soo's left alone.


1527
01:22:58,457 --> 01:23:02,097
[The only one left is Lee Kwang Soo.]


1528
01:23:02,097 --> 01:23:04,347
Lee Kwang Soo,
you're the only one left.


1529
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:06,167
I've been a fan since a long time.


1530
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:10,127
And I will be sincerely sincere.


1531
01:23:10,127 --> 01:23:12,497
Don't fool around, be sincere.


1532
01:23:12,497 --> 01:23:16,078
One, two, three!


1533
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:17,677
[Who is the woman that he'll pick?]


1534
01:23:17,677 --> 01:23:19,568
Seol Hyun.


1535
01:23:19,568 --> 01:23:25,137
[Seol Hyun, I'm here...]


1536
01:23:25,137 --> 01:23:29,768
[Will his sincerity
reach her heart?]


1537
01:23:31,787 --> 01:23:34,988
[A love triangle between Gary,
Seol Hyun and Kwang Soo.]


1538
01:23:34,988 --> 01:23:35,988
He's cool.


1539
01:23:35,988 --> 01:23:39,608
[It all depends on
Seol Hyun's choice!]


1540
01:23:39,608 --> 01:23:43,408
[A man who's trying to acquire love.]


1541
01:23:43,408 --> 01:23:46,658
[And a man who wants to protect it.]


1542
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:49,347
[What will the final decision be?]


1543
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:51,787
<i>[A shocking plot twist!]</i>
