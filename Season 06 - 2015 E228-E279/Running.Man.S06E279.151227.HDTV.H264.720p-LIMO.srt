It makes me so angry!


121

If you did, there would have been
100 more episodes of X-man!


123
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,889
I saved it for today.


124

pressure for the rest.]

I thought it wouldn't be
enough by myself.


131
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,850
So I've brought UP10TION with me.

[Andy and UP10TION's
performance is over!]

That's amazing.


161
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,490
You're supposed to
prepare for these things?

Good job!

- Guest fashion.
- Wedding hall!


166
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,809
When I was asked to be on X-man,
I asked who the female guests were.


167
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,779
There's someone here that stole my
heart ten years ago and even now.


168

[Out of these people?]


169

to her ever since I met her.

- Who thinks it's them?
- It's not me, for sure!


172
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,039
I've never been on X-man with him.


173
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,710
- What about you?
- I don't think so...


174
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,460
- And Ji Hyeon?
- I don't think so, either...


175
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,840
Who is it?


176
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,340
Maybe they're just in my heart.


177
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,679
Okay then, Jong Soo.
Please pour your heart into it.


178
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,080
Please turn the music on!


179
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,450
[This song is?]


180
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,190
"Lovers in Paris"!


181
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,480
[2004 drama "Lovers in Paris" OST.]


182
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,110
[Who is Jong Soo's woman?]


183
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,899
[Manly and serious Eagle Eye!]


184
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,240
[He starts walking
in rhythm to the music.]


185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,309
Is it me?


186
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:53,809
[Yes Jin Sook, it's you.]


187
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,049
[Chae Yeon has been picked!]


188

[His confession after ten years.]


189
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,490
[It's not ordinary.]


190
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,149
[Why me?]


191
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,620
[He's busy trying to sing and
bring people to the stage.]


192
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,929
[He puts his arm over her shoulder?]


193
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,200
[Are you ready for this Jin Sook?]


194
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
[Flustered, flustered]


195
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,399
[Change of attitude]


196
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,809
Get your hands off!
I told you to get your hands off her!


197
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,940
[This is?]


198
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,179
[A famous line in "Lovers of Paris."]


199
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,820
Get your hands off!
I told you to get your hands off her!


200
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,620
[He reenacted it perfectly!]


201
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,289
[Surprised]


202
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,490
You can't win!


203
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,299
If you didn't win for 33 years,
you won't win until you're 60!


204
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,799
I would break your arm!


205
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,240
But I'm not going to
in front of my woman!


206
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,169
Make sure you never run
into me again, you got it?


207
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,480
What are you, stupid?


208
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,929
You can't tell him
to take his hands off?


209
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,110
"He's my man."


210
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,350
"He's my boyfriend."


211
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,279
Why can't you say it!


212
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,679
"He's my man."


213
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,080
"He's my boyfriend."
Why can't you say it!


214
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,570
[Eagle Eye's acting is on fire.]


215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,230
[Why can't you say it!]


216
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,200
[And then he goes back
to singing, casually.]


217
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,899
[An unexpected performance.]


218
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,940
[He sings again for now.]


219
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,370
[Jin Sook, it's not over yet!]


220
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,240
Can't you see me?


221
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,779
Can't you?


222
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,549
[Pardon?]


223
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:43,419
Is she moved?


224
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:50,059
You're in my heart.


225
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,460
[Summer of 2004,
Lee Dong Gun's famous line.]


226
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,070
[Who knew we would
hear it again in 2015?]


227
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,840
[This is crazy.]


228
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,240
[He plays a double role.]
You're in my heart.


229
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,340
[This is so cheesy.]


230
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,250
[And then he goes back to singing.]


231
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,480
[Was he trying to be funny?]


232
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,259
[Jong Soo's ten years of love.]


233
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,159
[Jong Soo's performance
was like a musical.]


234
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,190
Wow!


235
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,860
Jin Sook's touched!


236
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,399
[Calm]


237
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,370
Wow!
I was so absorbed!


238
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,639
This reminds me of "Lovers of Paris."


239
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,710
What's Jung Nam going to do?


240
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,639
What's he going to do?


241
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,110

It's Animation Crew!


246
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,490
They're the Animation Crew, right?

[Kim Jung Nam and
Animation Crew's performance.]


248
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,019
[What kind of performance will
the original dancing machine show?]


249
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:12,169
[They warm up a little.]


250
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,970
[And slowly take their positions.]


251
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,909
[And then the real
performance starts!]


252
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,710
[The original dancing machine
is in full dance mode.]

[A surprise]


258
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,409
[People are screaming
here and there.]


259
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,039
[Kim Jung Nam had this kind of charm?]


260
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,379
[Give me the rose.]


261
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,590

[He goes straight
into his confession.]

[He goes to Ji Hyeon.]


264

[What will she say?]


265
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:18,529
[She receives the rose from Jung Nam
but sends a heart to Andy.]


266
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,070
[Shocked]


267
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,799
[Give me the rose!]


268
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,200
[Throws away]


269
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,440
[The original dancing
machine is angry.]


270
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,179
[When thou leavest
cloyed by my visage]


271
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,409
[Without a word let me myself
manage to send thee dearly.]


272
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,080
[Be pleased to have thy feet tenderly]


273
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:36,019
[lay, trodden on those
flowers bestrewed.]


274
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,779
It's a real rose.


275
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,879
I went to the fish market
this morning!


276
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,289
Wait, not fish market...


277
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,879
[His memory is bad.]


278
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,330
Why did you go to the fish market
to get a rose?


279
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,529
[Sorry, I have someone.]


280
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,870
We've seen the men's charms.


281
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,269
Ji Hyeon, shall we start by
showing off your charm?


282
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,669
Please give us music!


283
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:04,639
[The music starts and
she moves forward!]


284
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,799
[Where are you going?]


285
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,419
[She heads for Andy.]


286
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,059
[A shy dance of temptation.]


287
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,960
[Yoo Hyuk's burdensome dance.]


288

are a perfect sync.]

[She finishes off with
an arrow of love.]


295
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,019
Did you only go to Andy?


296
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,190
Back in the day, we were
both very active as idols


297
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,110
but we didn't get to interact a lot.


298
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,000
What happens if he rejects you?


299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,950
What if he does?
You didn't even go to anyone else.


300
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,660
[I believe that Andy
wouldn't do that.]


301
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,940
What a situation.


302
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,710
[Bluff]


303
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,640
Following Ji Hyeon


304

00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,089
[I see you.]


317
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,930

warming the crowd up.]

["Heart attack" by AOA.]


328

[The two sexy divas meet.]


336
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,819

[What is she doing?]


338
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
Did you see her face?


339
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,500
[She's upset,
but they're in perfect sync.]


340
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:25,039
[It's okay!
Go back now!]


341
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,440
[Seohyun leaves in a hurry.]


342

[His eyes were on fire.]


354
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,089
And Seol Hyun came up to help


355
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,660
but her face...


356
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,960
[Upset]


357
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,660
[Thanks, Seol Hyun.]


358
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,900
[You're the best, Chae Yeon!]


359
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,500
That was impressive.


360
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,200
[His shoelaces are untied.]


361
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,369
[Your laces are untied.]


362
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,240
That doesn't matter right now!


363
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,910
This is so nice!


364
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,079
It's been a while!


365
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,279
- Thank you.
- Please, a round of applause.


366
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,180
That's amazing.


367
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,420
So, last but not least


368
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,960
its time to make a decision.


369
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,859
I don't know who
will become a couple


370
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,230
but let's start with Kim Jong Kook!


371
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,730
I've never been
in this position before.


372
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,369
It's been ten years.


373
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:07,569
I'll give you five seconds.
Five, four, three...


374
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:10,509
Two, one.


375
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:16,910
[Who will be Jong Kook's partner?]


376
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,150
Stephanie,
let's play games together.


377
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,589
[Jong Kook's woman, Stephanie.]


378
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:28,119
One, two... one, two.


379
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,859
Three!


380
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,529
Yes.


381
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,750
[Jong Kook and Stephanie
are a couple.]


382
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,069
Next up is Andy!


383
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:43,549
One, two...


384
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,369
[Ji Hyeon showed her
affection to Andy.]


385
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,880
- Three!
- Ji Hyeon...


386
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,450
Would you like to
play games together?


387
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,049
Yes.


388
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,349
[Upset]


389
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,329
You couldn't really see them
together back in the day.


390
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,920
Now, Ha Ha!


391
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,799
Your head must be
pretty complicated.


392
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,750
I wasn't expecting this.


393
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,880
I'll call you, confidently.


394
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,329
- Jin Sook!
- If it were ten years ago


395
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,950
I would have said no


396
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,200
- And called someone else?
- Yes.


397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,529
But I'm going to let him go.


398
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,859
[Goodbye...]


399
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:31,640
Yeah, just let go.


400
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,490
But I'm still rejecting you.


401
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,519
[I'm still rejecting you.]


402
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,589
[That was a quick rejection.]


403
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:43,230
[I won't forget.]


404
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,000
[Sorry.]


405
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,329
Jong Soo!
One...


406
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,269
- Two.
- It's been ten years.


407
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,839
If it doesn't work out today,
maybe in another ten years.


408
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,619
[Wow, romantic.]


409
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,950
- I will call out her name.
- One, two, three!


410
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,349
Chae Yeon, let's play games together.


411
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,549
[She accepted him in a heartbeat.]


412
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,599
[Jong Soo and Chae Yeon are a couple.]


413
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,859
Congratulations!


414
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:09,589
[I know how you feel.]


415
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,690
[All the couples have been decided!]


416
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,930
Now, we will start the couple game.


417
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,599
It's only one round.


418
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,039
It's simple, you need to
decorate the Christmas tree.


419
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,339
You need to put the ornaments in between
your cheeks and go hang them.


420
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,210
The team that can get the most
ornaments in three minutes will win.


421
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,109
The most important thing here


422
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,150
is that it's the best game
to figure who the X-man is.


423
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,220
- I forgot there was an X-man!
- I forgot.


424
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,450
I'm sure you forgot about it.


425
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,200
It is the best game
to figure out who it is.


426
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,420
<i>Since it's a collaboration with
Running Man, there's an R-man.</i>


427
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,559
<i>[Before the Go Fight]
Only me?</i>


428
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,329
<i>[Kwang Soo was heading
to somewhere alone.]</i>


429
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,339
<i>Because we're holding an
X-man special on Running Man</i>


430
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,670
<i>we will be giving you
a special mission.</i>


431
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,480
<i>You are not X-man.</i>


432
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,059
<i>However, you are R-man.</i>


433
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,990
<i>You can pretend you're X-man.</i>


434
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,880
<i>You will be helping so that
X-man's team loses.</i>


435
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,910
<i>You will protect X-man
with different tactics.</i>


436
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,680
<i>If X-man doesn't get
caught until the end</i>


437
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,880
<i>it will be X-man
and R-man's victory.</i>


438
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,970
<i>X-man will know that there's R-man
but they won't know who it is.</i>


439
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,730
<i>How can I let X-man know
that I'm R-man?</i>


440
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,509
I think it's either Andy of Bobby.


441
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:46,309
You, as R-man received a message
from X-man for help.


442
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,279
[He got a secret command
before the couple game.]


443
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,750
Make an intentional
error in the game


444
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,589
and do something that
can arouse suspicion.


445
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,559
[That's my specialty.]


446
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,630
[But who could the X-man be?]


447
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,200
Ready!
Three minute time limit!


448
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,170
Please watch out for X-man.


449
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,680
And there's also R-man.


450
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,640
It would be obvious in this game.


451
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,450
Ready!


452
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,200
[B.I and Ji Hyo are moving with the
ornament between their cheeks.]


453
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,509
[Jung Nam and Ha Ha
daringly go for the mouth.]


454
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,190
- They're good!
- They're playing it well.


455
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,630
Go slowly!


456
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,670
[B.I and Ji Hyo succeeded.]


457
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,029
Okay, next!


458
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,640
[Jung Nam and Ha Ha are clear.]


459
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,569
Okay, next couple!


460
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,710
[Next is Suk Jin and Gary.]


461
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,779
[Suk Jin and Gary failed so easily?]


462
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,549
[Jimin and Bobby are fixing the
ornament between their cheeks.]


463
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,450
[Jong Kook and Stephanie are speedy!]


464
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,990
[It's a close game.]


465
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,329
Okay, next!
Hurry!


466
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:14,200
[Andy and Ji Hyeo vs.
Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun.]


467
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,019
<i>Make an intentional
error in the game</i>


468
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:20,640
<i>and make an action that
can arouse suspicion.</i>


469
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,339
[Alright, I'll show you
the skill of R-man.]


470
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,440
[Everyone can see that
it was so awkward.]


471
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,819
- What are you doing?
- No, that's not it!


472
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:42,509
He's suspicious!


473
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,190
Kwang Soo's a little weird.


474
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,130
[Well I did something
to arouse suspicion...]


475
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,599
Please watch for X-man.


476
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,069
[The game continues.]


477
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,299
[The score is 3:3.]


478
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,970
[It's Jong Soo and Chae Yeon's turn.]


479
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,509
[Jong Soo's mistake.]


480
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,450
[Very suspicious]


481
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,690
[He's not upset even after
making a mistake?]


482
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,359
[Bobby and Jimin move full speed.]


483
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,990
[They succeeded in a flash!]


484
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,509
[Jung Nam and Ha Ha are
using their lips again!]


485
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,730
[The current score is 4:4.]


486
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,549
[Jong Kook and Stephanie
are on the move.]


487
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,609
[Watching carefully]


488
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:37,410
Up, up, up.
You can't make it?


489
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,650
[Why is he putting it on the higher
string when there's a lower one?]


490
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,019
[He succeeded]


491
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:47,519
[but it's a little suspicious.]


492
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,619
If you make the same mistake,
you're X-man and R-man.


493
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,640
They're probably R-man and X-man.


494
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,069
[Seol Hyun is a little suspicious...]


495
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,799
Go slowly!


496
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,769
[Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun
reach the tree.]


497
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,799
[And all they have left is to hang it.]


498
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,410
- Why are you putting it there?
- Put it on the side!


499
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,619
[Seol Hyun leans her cheek
forward and they failed.]


500
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,150
[That's so weird.]


501
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,089
- They're so suspicious!
- Kwang Soo's weird!


502
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:26,890
[Is Seol Hyun really X-man?]


503
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,660
[The current score is 6:6.]


504
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,329
[Jong Soo and Chae Yeon are as
suspicious as Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun.]


505
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,640
[Turn]


506
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,339
[Why are you turning all of a sudden?]


507
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,150
[They failed again
with Jong Soo's turn.]


508
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,380
[Eagle Eye is making
so many mistakes.]


509
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,619
[What is this?
Is Jong Soo the X-man?]


510
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,720
[Both male couples are up.]


511
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,990
[Jung Nam, Ha Ha and Suk Jin, Gary
are doing their best.]


512
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,329
[And it's Kwang Soo and
Seol Hyun's turn again.]


513
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,000
[Everyone's keeping
an eye on them.]


514
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,640
If you don't hang it
this time, it's you!


515
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,910
Hurry up!


516
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,279
Don't rush!
Just hang it!


517
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,039
- There's one minute left!
- They're going to win!


518
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,809
[We need to succeed this time.]


519
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,019
[They both succeeded.]


520
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:30,019
[Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun's
suspicion decreased a little.]


521
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,200
[Jong Soo and Chae Yeon
are getting more suspicious.]


522
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,039
[They failed again
because of Jong Soo.]


523
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,970
He's weird!


524
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,730
He's X-man!


525
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,799
[Is Jong Soo X-man?]


526
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,640
- It worked.
- Okay!


527
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,750
[It's Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun's turn.]


528
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,150
We won, we won.


529
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,150
They won't hang it, look.


530
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,519
[The current score is 12:11.]


531
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,160
[While they struggle]


532
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,960
[it's Jong Soo and
Chae Yeon's turn again.]


533
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,759
[Just then]


534
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,630
[They failed again.]


535
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,269
Hurry up!


536
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:21,039
[This is our chance.]


537
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,569
[I don't know if Seol Hyun's the X-man]


538
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:29,180
[but we need to succeed
and dispel our suspicion.]


539
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,650
[They succeeded.]


540
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,150
[Time out]


541
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,390
We won!


542
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,960
Team Ji won with a score of 13 vs. 11!


543
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,859
X-man must be on that team.


544
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:48,200
There is someone
suspicious here though.


545
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,599
[Jong Soo is the main suspect as X-man.]


546
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,970
[If Jong Soo's really X-man,
that's dangerous...]


547
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,640
He kept blowing in my ear.


548
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,670
[Did Jong Soo really make a mistake]


549
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:05,450
[of is he X-man?]


550
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,519
The original X-man members
know how to play it!


551
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,750
I love them!


552
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,589
Now, the only thing we have
is the final vote.


553
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,460
Is that real?


554
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:19,890
Will you be able to
find out who X-man is?


555
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,529
But so many people look suspicious.


556
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,200
2015, X-man and Running Man
collaboration!


557
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,410
We'll leave for the final site now!


558
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,970
[In a moment]


559
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:37,680
[2016, Luck Battle]


560
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,150
[How will Running Man's
luck be in 2016?]


561
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,920
[Their fortunes aren't ordinary!]


562
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,079
[And the twist at the end!]


563
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,019
[There's a person with
the best luck in 2016?]


564
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,990
[Who will it be?]


565
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,829
Originally, we used to vote
for the person we think at the end.


566
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,700
This time, it's the
collaboration project.


567
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,440
It's the collaboration.


568
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,980
We'll do the last vote
in Running Man style.


569
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,339
It's simple.


570
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:15,480
Inside the SBS building,
16 laptops are prepared for voting.


571
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,950
We have 16 people today.


572
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,349
You can find the laptop,
and vote on it.


573
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,059
[Out of many computers in the building,
they have to find the right laptops!]


574
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,230
The laptops will have an R sticker.


575
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,230
And you can vote more than once.


576
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,200
R-man and X-man could vote, too.


577
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,339
When a players gets a majority vote


578
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll announce the name.


579
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,809
You will win if you eliminate
the person, and it says X-man.


580
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,880
You have three chances


581
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,549
and you have 10 minutes to
eliminate the name tag.


582
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,680
[The first round begins.]


583
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,250
There's none on 15th floor.
You don't give us any hint?


584
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,799
Whose name should I write?


585
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,660
Seol Hyun was the most suspicious though.


586
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,230
- Oh, X-man!
- I'm not X-man.


587
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,759
You're not X-man for sure?


588
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,859
- I think it's you.
- I'm not!


589
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,599
Seol Hyun, watch out for your name tag!


590
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,269
I won't go easy on you!


591
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:20,240
But, I'm not X-man...


592
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,509
Seol Hyun looks suspicious.


593
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:28,720
When we were moving the ornament


594
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,990
she was able to hang it
only once.


595
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,960
So, I think it's her.


596
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,930
[They slowly narrow
it down to Seol Hyun.]


597
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,200
If you win the race


598
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,983
if X-man wins, we'll donate 17 million


599
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:47,470
won under X-man and R-man's name.


600
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:55,579
If you catch X-man,
you will donate under your name.


601
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,049
I wonder if I'm not good
at finding laptops.


602
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,420
Maybe they found it over there?


603
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,530
[Seol Hyun meets Eagle Eye.]
Did you find it?


604
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,159
[I can feel it.]


605
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,349
- Seol Hyun...
- It's not me.


606
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,079
- You're not?
- I'm telling you the truth.


607
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,059
Please believe me,
I'm not X-man.


608
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:27,039
[Eagle Eye's eyes flare up.]


609
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,539
Look at my eyes.


610
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:32,170
[Like this...
I can look at you with honesty.]


611
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:36,880
[If you look at me liket that...]


612
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,239
You're not.


613
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,059
[With Seol Hyun's innocent look,
his eyes cool down.]


614
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,019
She's not X-man.


615
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,969
[By the way, R-man Kwang Soo
has to help X-man.]


616
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,219
I hope Seol Hyun was X-man.


617
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,369
[What a sweet thought.]


618
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,170
If it's Seol Hyun


619
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,179
maybe it's our fate.


620
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,380
This building's too big!


621
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,750
[R-man Kwang Soo finds the laptop.]


622
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,909
Who should I write?
Jong Kook or B.I?


623
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,000
Jong Soo?
Someone strong...


624
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,159
The least suspicious person...


625
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,880
I have no choice!
[To disturb the voting result]


626
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,199
[B.I gets one vote.]


627
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,340
If Seol Hyun is really X-man,
it's too easy.


628
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,349
[B.I: one]


629
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:39,239
B.I?
[Did Kwang Soo's plan worked?]


630
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,949
Finally!


631
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:43,750
Seol Hyun gets one vote.


632
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,650
It's right there!


633
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,570
Seol Hyun!


634
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,260
Seol Hyun!
Two votes for Seol Hyun.


635
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,440
I'm 100 percent sure it's Seol Hyun,
but we need a majority of people.


636
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,369
If I misspell her name
like this, does it count?


637
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,400
Seol Hyung...
[Seol Hyun gets four votes.]


638
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,530
[Everyone's voting for Seol Hyun.]


639
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,679
She has four votes.
What if she's not X-man?


640
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,679
Kwang Soo!


641
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,610
Kwang Soo, you have my vote!


642
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,639
Kwang Soo has two votes.


643
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,710
Again, it's Kwang Soo.


644
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,260
Kwang Soo is catching up.
He's always on the list.


645
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,909
Seol Hyun has five votes,
Kwang Soo has four.


646
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:30,750
B.I has one vote.
Kwang Soo's catching up.


647
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,929
Laptop...


648
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:36,039
It's right here.


649
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,260
Write down the name of X-man.


650
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,269
[Seol Hyun]
I think...


651
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:43,539
[Seol Hyun gets six.]


652
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,639
Here's another one!


653
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,050
[He keeps finding the laptops.]


654
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,110
It's too easy.


655
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,170
[Seol Hyun has seven votes.]


656
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,019
[He finds the laptop.]


657
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,840
I kept putting Seol Hyun's name.


658
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,329
Should I write someone else?
[Seol Hyun]


659
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,730
[Seol Hyun gets 8 out of 16!]


660
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,909
[They have a majority vote.]


661
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>We'll finish voting right now.</i>


662
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,510
I think it'll be me.


663
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:30,250
In 10 minutes,
you need to eliminate the name tag of...


664
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,690
Seol Hyun who gained eight votes.


665
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,760
Find Seol Hyun and eliminate
her name tag in 10 minutes.


666
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,230
I'm not X-man!


667
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,099
[I'll see you soon!]


668
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,070
[Everyone's searching for Seol Hyun.]


669
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,039
If Seol Hyun is X-man.


670
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,869
Where are you Seol Hyun?


671
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,539
Seol Hyun who gained eight votes.


672
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,179
[R-man Lee Kwang Soo
is in a state of emergency.]


673
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,599
What if Seol Hyun is X-man?


674
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,719
It'll be really weird.


675
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,110
[I have nowhere to hide!]


676
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,159
Seol Hyun!
[R-man will protect you!]


677
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,230
[The rest of the members are searching.]
Where are you coming from?


678
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,800
Seol Hyun!


679
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,239
[At that time, Eagle Eye rushes!]


680
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,130
[She hides behind the pole.]


681
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:33,260
[The emcee Jae Suk
arrives at the scene.]


682
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,619
I'm not!


683
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,420
[She's over there!]


684
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,000
Seol Hyun...
[Eagle Eye is trying to beseige her.]


685
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,969
What are you doing?


686
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,860
All of a sudden, you...


687
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,280
disappeared with her,
so I was surprised.


688
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,269
- I'm not X-man!
- I see.


689
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,530
I understand!


690
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,969
I'm not X-man,
tell them I am not.


691
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,309
Do you remember you met me earlier?


692
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:12,150
When I asked if you were
X-man, you looked at me.


693
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,150
She's not?


694
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,570
Ji Min!
[Hold it, right there!]


695
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,800
Seol Hyun is here, hurry up!


696
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,489
That's amazing!
[She takes her down right away.]


697
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:26,150
I'm not X-man,
I worked hard!


698
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,480
Hold still!


699
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,369
[He eliminates Seol Hyun's name tag.]


700
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,840
Hold, it should be written on her back.
Could you show me your back?


701
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,909
- It's on her back.
- You'll regret this.


702
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,730
Seol Hyun!
[Is she X-man?]


703
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,820
Let's see if Seol Hyun was X-man.


704
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,150
[Ever since she fails during Go Fight]


705
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,159
[everyone was suspicious of Seol Hyun.]


706
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,960
[Most of the members point to Seol Hyun.]


707
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,800
She collapsed as she was passing.


708
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,960
She wasn't playing to win.


709
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,099
[Is she really innocent?
Or is she acting?]


710
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,059
[She doesn't have the mark.]
She's not.


711
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,780
I told you!


712
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,019
[Mental break!]
I said I'm not!


713
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,909
Seol Hyun wasn't X-man.


714
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,110
I didn't write your name.


715
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,349
You failed to find X-man
in the first round.


716
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:38,269
Let's start the second round.
[If Seol Hyun is not, then who is X-man?]


717
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,929
[The first round, they failed
to apprehend X-man.]


718
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,969
Seol Hyun wasn't X-man.


719
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:49,219
You failed the first round.


720
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,369
It's already over?


721
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,219
It wasn't Seol Hyun?


722
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:58,110
Someone already ripped her name tag?


723
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,090
<i>Seol Hyun wasn't X-man.</i>


724
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:05,969
Seol Hyun wasn't?


725
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:08,260
She's not that type of person.


726
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,170
So, she actually chose me.


727
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,510
[The suspect for the
second round was Andy]


728
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,820
[but he wasn't X-man, either!]


729
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,170
If you can't find it during the
third round, it'll be over.


730
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,400
The third round begins now!


731
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:30,400
[The laptops are in different locations]
Excuse me, let me vote for a second.


732
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,659
Kim Jung Nam.


733
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:40,989
Chae Yeon.


734
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:43,929
The vote differs.


735
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:45,829
This is a bad sign.


736
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,369
This is the last round!


737
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:50,340
Just one more round and it's over!


738
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,539
What's that?


739
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:56,940
The members move ahead of R-man.


740
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,650
[He doesn't even know who X-man is,
how can he help him?]


741
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,250
<i>[When he was given the mission]
You're R-man.</i>


742
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:08,289
<i>[he was told to help him
by confusing other members.]</i>


743
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:14,489
<i>[And protect X-man until the end.]</i>


744
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:18,199
It'll be good If I get
out during the third round.


745
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:21,269
I need to write my name.


746
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:28,639
Who's the least suspicious?


747
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,679
This is the last round.


748
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,349
If they eliminate me, X-man will win.


749
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,710
I'll write my name.


750
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,150
[The ultimate step to protect X-man]
[R-man's suicide!]


751
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,250
- Kwang Soo!
- He's not!


752
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,690
I don't think it's Kwang Soo.


753
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,260
If Kwang Soo gets one more vote,
it'll be over.


754
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:53,099
Wait, Jung Nam!


755
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,269
Don't write anything.
Everyone's suspicious of you.


756
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,440
- But, I'm not!
- Let me write it.


757
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,710
- I'm not going to write your name.
- I'll hold Jung Nam.


758
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,940
Write it.


759
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:10,679
Why are you writing your name?


760
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,219
You're R-man!


761
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:14,730
[I got caught!]


762
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,420
You're R-man, right?


763
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,329
You're X-man, aren't you?


764
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:24,130
I think Kwang Soo's R-man.


765
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,400
[The sudden R-man's harassing
tactic confuses everyone.]


766
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,199
[Did the stubborn R-man
successfully write his name?]


767
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:32,329
[Lee Kwang Soo]


768
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,170

is Lee Kwang Soo.]

Kwang Soo is not X-man!
He's really not X-man.


774
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:58,559
Watch it turn out to be Kwang Soo.


775
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,559
X-man, I don't know who you are.


776
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,500
I really missed you.


777
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,099
[See you soon, my destiny!]

10th floor where Kwang Soo is.]

[Hesitate]
Are you?


781
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,860
- I'm not.
- You're R-man, aren't you?


782

[You finally figured it out!]


783
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,559
I think my tactic was brilliant.


784

Why?
Are you really R-man?


785
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,500
When you see it on TV, you'll want
to be on my team from now on.


786

[He's proud of his sacrificing tactic.]


787
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,739
- Even I'm surprised.
- Then, you need to be eliminated.


788
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,739
Yes, either way.


789
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,010
Isn't is worth the Nobel prize?


790

791
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:56,949
What Nobel prize?


792
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:59,550
You don't know what
the Nobel prize is for?


793
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,420
Are you talking about
the Nobel Prize in Literature?


794
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,460
Is that Jong Kook?
I don't want to be eliminated by him.

796
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,780
What's wrong with you?
Why are you blocking me?


797
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,579
I was on the 10th floor!


798
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,849
Jong Kook, this is the last chance.


799
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:35,789
If Kwang Soo's not X-man


800
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:38,590
it means you failed arresting X-man.


801
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,590
[The members don't know
Kwang Soo's R-man.]


802

00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:18,530
- Wow, X-man!
- You've failed to arrest X-man today.

[Out of the 13 members left,
who's the real X-man?]

815
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,150
and she wasn't X-man.


816
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,420
And Andy for the second round,
but he wasn't.


817
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,420
Then, Kwang Soo for the third round.


818
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,590
He was R-man, not X-man.


819
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:55,710
Because you couldn't find X-man.
The winner is X-man.


820

He wasn't really trying
during "Of Course."


828
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,510
Will Kim Jong Kook really be X-man?


829

He's right.
I feel betrayed!

00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,260
- He didn't know it.
- I didn't think he was X-man.


870
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,260
[How can you not recognize
your partner in front of you?]


871
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,960
- They didn't know each other?
- They didn't.


872
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,300
He didn't know?
I thought he knew it.


873
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,840
Anyway, the final winners are.


874
00:49:52,840 --> 00:50:00,280
X-man and R-man,
Kim Jong Kook and Lee Kwang Soo!


875
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,219
[Even after 10 years,
it hasn't changed a bit...]


876
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:13,920
[Our memory is alive within us,
even after 10 years.]


877

[2016 Luck Battle]


878
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,670
We've just finished X-man.


879
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,510
We're here again.


880
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:38,250
Thank you for welcoming X-man,
and enjoying the show.


881
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,949
Thank you so much!


882
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:44,079
For the new year, 2016.


883
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,289
For you and myself...


884
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:50,590
aren't you curious about
your luck for the next year?


885
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,889
It's the year of red monkey.
(It sounds like a slang for "idiot.")


886
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,329
I think he's saying it on purpose.


887
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:01,030
Anyway, we'll have to run hard again.


888
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:04,909
So, I've prepared something special.


889
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:07,670
It's the "Ladder of Fate."


890
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,739
Like an exorcism,
to avoid bad luck in the new year.


891
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:12,679
Behind you, there're
numbers one to seven.


892
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,320
We'll tell you the luck numbers
according to Tojung's book of fortune.


893
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,050
We'll use the numbers for the latter?


894
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,960
[They will choose their
lucky number and color.]


895
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,860
[They'll read their fortune for 2016
by tarot card, face and palm reading.]


896
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,289
[And complete the ladder of fortune!]

[Who will be the only one
for the exorcism event?]


898
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,829
We'll see our luck by
"Tojung's Book of Fortune."


899
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,769
[According to each person's
birth date and time]

He's really famous!


902
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:43,539
He's an idol in the
world of fortune telling.


903
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,880
[Fortune teller, Park Sung Jun]
[19 years of experience]


904
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,880
Today, I'll announce


905
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:56,199
the rankings of the best
luck in the year of 2016.


906
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,949
I hope I'm in the
middle of the rankings.


907
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,329
I'll tell your fortunes
from Ji Suk Jin.


908
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,309
Sit in front of him.


909
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:06,530
- I'm nervous.
- I'm not used to this.


910
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,030
[This is for fun,
why do you get so nervous?]


911
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:12,840
Ji Suk Jin, you were born as stone
out of the five elements.


912
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,369
[In eastern philosophy, the five elements
wood, fire, earth, metal and water]


913
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,219
[are the fundamental
components of the Universe.]


914
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,800
Like a solid stone, you're faithful.


915
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,570
What?
You said he's faithful?


916
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,219
- He's faithful.
- And he's easily influenced by others.


917
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,039
[Totally agree!]


918
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,710
- When other say something...
- I'm influenced, right.


919
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:38,369
- He's influenced, but also stubborn.
- How did you know that?


920
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:43,369
He's absolutely right.
He and I went to ten used car dealers.


921
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,510
"Why don't you buy one
if you like any of them?"


922
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:51,409
On the way home,
he bought a new car near his house.


923
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:56,420
After visiting ten used car dealers,
he bought a car from the new car dealer.


924
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,250
The book is absolutely right!


925
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,730
You want to do lots of things.


926
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,519
He does!


927
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:06,860
You want do start a lot of things,
and do the things others do, too.


928
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,929
In 2016, don't do anything.


929
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:16,130
[In 2016, don't do anything.]


930
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:19,869
What should Suk Jin do?


931
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,150
[Burst of laughter]


932
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,110
He's planning to start a few things!


933
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,860
The keyword from the book
for Suk Jin is "don't do anything!"


934
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,079
This is the best thing I've ever heard!


935
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,150
Just don't do anything.


936
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,280
[Shattered]


937
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:39,090
Just do what you're good at.


938
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,289
The long and short of it.


939
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:43,760
It's even more shocking than
"the outcome won't be good."


940
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,690
Don't wander around


941
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,300
but stick to what you've been doing.


942
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,460
And stay quietly.


943
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,369
This is that kind of time for you.
I'll tell your lucky numbers and colors.


944
00:53:55,369 --> 00:54:00,070
Your lucky colors are yellow and white.


945
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,340
He has yellow underwear!


946
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:08,619
Those colors can make
your fortune better.


947
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:11,949
Your lucky numbers are O and Sa.
(Five and four)


948
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,889
- O and Sa?
- O Sa!


949
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,519
O Sua!


950
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,659
[It sounds like Big-nosed Brother's
catch phrase "Woo Sua."]


951
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,900
You're really accurate!


952
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,829
[Lucky numbers: 5,4]
[Lucky colors: yellow, white]


953
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:31,039
Gary's personality is you can't stand
when someone tries to control you.


954
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,769
- That's right!
- You want to be free.


955
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:35,329
Like a bohemian.


956
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:39,199
Because you're lack of something
that holds you.


957
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:41,480
That controls you.


958
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,920
You hate when someone tries control you.


959
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,889
You feel uneasy when that happens.


960
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:52,489
There's only one person
who can control you.


961
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,630
- Isn't that Ha Ha?
- That person can lead you.


962
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:57,929
Someone who'll be able
to help each other.


963
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:00,300
He needs to choose this person
when we need a partner.


964
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,869
He's Kim Jong Kook.


965
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:05,800
You should be nice to me!


966
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,239
They talk to each other
even for serious matters.


967
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,829
Gary might feel a little stressed


968
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:16,150
but your relationship is good
especially for Kim Jong Kook.


969
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,750
Because of Gary, you can make more money
and extend your field of activity.


970
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,050
Because of me, Jong Kook's luck rises?


971
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,320
Not Gary, but Jong Kook's luck rises.


972
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,760
Kang Gary is my pot of gold.


973
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,929
You always have too many
things to think about.


974
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:35,030
You want to do many things.
And also want to expand your business.


975
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,800
In the year of red monkey, 2016


976
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:45,840
with Ji Suk Jin,
don't do anything.


977
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:50,230
Can you please calculate again for me?


978
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,780
[You, too, stay still
for the next year.]


979
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,420
I feel so bad for Gary!


980
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,909
I've already started a lot!


981
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:57,840
Stop it now!


982
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,199
It's too late to stop.


983
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:05,460
Should I not invest any more?


984
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,230
Now is...
time to take a break.


985
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,030
[It's just your luck,
you can change it with your will.]

989

- B.I?
- She likes him a lot.

You're always surrounded by a lot men.


992

Look, they're all men.


993
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:33,940
But, they're not decent men.


994
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,389
[No one seems decent here...]


995
00:56:36,389 --> 00:56:38,960
Are you talking about us?


996
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,000
Well, we're all weird.


997
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,340
From 2016 until you turn 37,
you might be able to meet a good man.


998
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,519
- Will these start dating?
- You have good luck for two years, too.


999
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:53,340
You're about the age.
Think about it.

He is nice guy.


1004
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,019
But you're stubborn.


1005
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:11,059
It's not very obvious


1006
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:16,329
but you're usually satisfied
when you do things your way.


1007
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,440
Since 2015, your luck is on upturn.


1008

In the year of 2016, you'll be able to
start new things.

I envy him, I kind of hate him.


1011
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,820
Why?
What's wrong with me?


1012
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,969
You can even do a lot of things, too.


1013
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:43,360
But, they won't turn out good.


1014

[The result won't be good...]


1015
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:49,429

[Oh, no...]

[Doing nothing is better than failing.]


1018

But, the year 2016 has a big fire.


1023

It'll be a good luck for you again.


1024

Again?
[What's wrong with him?]


1025

He's talking about my fortune.
What's with you?


1026

If he's good, it's good for us, too.

It's always bright for him.


1028

your luck can lead you to grow.

You have a big mouth,
it means you're ambitious.

Your luck with children
is good this year.

00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,960
He's planning for it!


1036
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,800
He told me he plans to
have another child.


1037
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,239
One thing you need to be careful of...
is Gary.


1038
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,599
Try avoiding Gary.


1039
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:13,000
[His luck overall is good,
but Gary is the problem.]


1040
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,409
That's so funny!


1041
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:18,010
This is stressful!


1042
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,860
There's a man who's well
suited with Yoo Jae Suk.


1043
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,849
Please, please, please!


1044
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:27,039
That's our hope!


1045
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,750
- It's Lee Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo?


1046
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,530
[They're holding their hands tightly.]


1047
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,550
Lee Kwang Soo is like
firewood to Yoo Jae Suk.


1048
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,900
I'll give you firewood!
I'm your firewood!


1049
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,909
Watch out!
I'll put the fire out!


1050
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:47,309
[They still need to avoid Kang Gary.]


1051
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:49,329
You, you're my firewood!


1052
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:52,480
I'll burn the fire furiously!


1053
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,780
2016, the year of red monkey


1054
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,090
your luck is in second place.


1055
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,889
In second place?


1056
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,230
[If Jae Suk's luck is in second,
who has the best luck?]


1057
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:08,530
[Lucky numbers: 3,7]
[Lucky colors: blue, red]


1058
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:13,869
Lastly, I'll explain Kim Jong Kook
Lee Kwang Soo's luck together.


1059
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,400
Lee Kwang Soo was born as a big tree.


1060
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,210
For a tree to grow, you need water.


1061
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,309
You have enough water,
and rooted well in on the earth.


1062
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:24,610
You have everything!


1063
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,110
But, there's no sun.


1064
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:30,429
[No sun, no photosynthesis.]


1065
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,059
You have desire to grow high


1066
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:37,059
but you feel like you're
lacking in something.


1067
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:41,599
So, you want to fill up emotionally.


1068
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,159
That's right!


1069
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:44,829
Absolutely true!


1070
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:49,340
He's tall and handsome,
but his hip is flat.


1071
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,530
How does it relate to this?


1072
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:55,309
He feels lonely a lot.
He calls me early in the morning.


1073
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:57,355
You're a tree who
was born in the summer


1074
01:00:57,355 --> 01:00:59,400
but you're lacking in warmth.


1075
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,349
- You have a hot temper.
- You're right!


1076
01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:04,280
You want to see results quickly.


1077
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,550
Even with relationships,
you're lacking in means.


1078
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,750
Oh my goodness!


1079
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,690
- How do you know that?
- He's always dumped.


1080
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,110
- He's in a hurry for that, too.
- Exactly!


1081
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,880
He surprised all of them.


1082
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,000
They say "why are you doing
that all of a sudden?"


1083
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:24,000
He always confess his
feelings at the wrong timing.


1084
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,940
- Jae Suk told me to confess!
- You're my firewood!


1085
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,840
He told me to do that!


1086
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,309
I was put to shame!


1087
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:35,880
It's accurate.


1088
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,449
Kim Jong Kook has good technique
to analyze things well and make money.


1089
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:43,150
Analyze!


1090
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:47,989
You're good at analyzing
and apprehending.


1091
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,960
Even with relationships


1092
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,269
- you try to analyze.
- He does that!


1093
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,139
- So true!
- You need to open your heart!


1094
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,840
I'm not that young any more.


1095
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,710
You have a frame for the ideal type.


1096
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,739
True, true!


1097
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:10,980
Try to forget those frame,
but open your heart.


1098
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,420
That's how it is.


1099
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,280
From 2017, your luck goes up.


1100
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,159
There's possibility for you
to meet a good woman.


1101
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:19,760
That's the year after next.


1102
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,159
He will use that as an excuse next year.


1103
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:24,900
I was thinking about getting
married the year after next.


1104
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:30,070
One of you has the best luck next year.


1105
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,739
- Who is it?
- The man is...


1106
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,170
[Giraffe Lee Kwang Soo]


1107
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,150
[vs. Tiger Kim Jong Kook]


1108
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,679
[Who has the best luck in
the year of red monkey?]


1109
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,849
Lee Kwang Soo!


1110
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:47,780
- Is this a good thing?
- Of course it is!


1111
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,050
- Thank you so much!
- We knew it!


1112
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,659
[Fortune telling for
the members are over!]


1113
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:57,489
[Kim Jong Kook's lucky numbers: 3,7]
[Lucky colors: blue, red]


1114
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:00,369
[Lee Kwang Soo's lucky numbers: 2,5]
[Lucky colors: red, yellow]


1115
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:03,670
You can pick a color


1116
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:08,039
and put it on the number you like.


1117
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:10,369
Put your name on top of it.


1118
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,539
We'll let the least luckiest
person pick first.


1119
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,480
What do you want?


1120
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,610
I'll pick white.


1121
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:19,309
- What number?
- Number four.


1122
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,820
[He picks one of his lucky numbers.]


1123
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,150
[Four: Gary]


1124
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,960
The mixture of white and black is gray.


1125
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,989
And I pick number one.


1126
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:30,730
[Suk Jin picks yellow and five.]


1127
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,389
[Ji Hyo picks blue and six.]


1128
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:34,530
[Jong Kook picks red and three.]


1129
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:36,420
[Jae Suk picks green and seven.]


1130
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,349
[Lee Kwang Soo picks orange and two.]


1131
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:41,800
We all picked the numbers!


1132
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:48,409
For the lines on the ladder,
we invited a tarot reader.


1133
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,179
Hello!
[Surprised]


1134
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:54,920
We can tell she's a tarot reader
with her costume.


1135
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,820
[Tarot Master Quinny]


1136
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,394
[Tarot reading: Out of 78 tarot cards]


1137
01:03:59,394 --> 01:04:00,969
[you pick to see the answers
to the problems you have.]


1138
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:03,710
I've never done this before.
Me, too!


1139
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,460
[Who's the best partner
for Running Man games?]


1140
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,260
Do you want to start, Kwang Soo?


1141
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,260
He has the best luck in 2016.


1142
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,170
Except love, he's all good.


1143
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,369
You can pick now.


1144
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:17,239
I don't know how to do it.


1145
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:18,440
Is it your first time?


1146
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,530
For tarot reading, it's good to pick
a specific subject you want to look.


1147
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,110
We'll see who's your best partner.


1148
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,969
Oh, it's for the game partner?


1149
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,679
[Who's the best partner
for the doubles they'll play next?]


1150
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:30,260
It's not about overall luck.


1151
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,949
It's fascinating.


1152
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,690
You get to pick a card.


1153
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:40,429
Think about one person.


1154
01:04:40,429 --> 01:04:44,309
- And pick three cards.
- Three cards?


1155
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:46,329
Maybe it's past, present and future.


1156
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:49,630
You can't blame anyone about it,
because you're the one picking the cards.


1157
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,440
She doesn't pick the cards for us.


1158
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,510
It's my pick with my will.


1159
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,309
Even the picture looks mysterious.


1160
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:02,110
With this person, it's
easy in the beginning


1161
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,750
but the end result won't be that good.


1162
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,780
That's true!


1163
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,260
It's good in the beginning,
there's always trouble in the middle.


1164
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,820
- It's Ha Ha!
- It won't be easy to end well.


1165
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:17,000
- Who did you think about?
- I thought about Ha Ha.


1166
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,150
[Ha Ha]


1167
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,000
They get along so well in the beginning.


1168
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,170
But, at the end...
they always fight.


1169
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,039
We cursed at each other
so many times!


1170
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:30,570
[It's amazingly correct?]


1171
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:34,980
- Can you check another partner?
- Think about the second person.


1172
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,179
That's incredible!


1173
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:39,849
[What are the meanings of the cards?]


1174
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:42,519
- You have lots to learn.
- It's Jae Suk.


1175
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:44,349
[A member he can learn lots of things?]


1176
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:46,260
- Is it me?
- Yes.


1177
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:51,929
Yes, but it doesn't spark up
like when fire flares up.


1178
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:54,860
You're supporting him
as firewood!


1179
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,269
You're my fuel, you know.


1180
01:05:57,269 --> 01:05:59,340
[Bitter]
Don't try to take it from me.


1181
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:02,809
- How come you didn't pick me?
- I was going to pick you last.


1182
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:05,409
You always call me at night.


1183
01:06:05,409 --> 01:06:08,210
Lastly.
[How will their compatibility be?]


1184
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:12,150
[From the end]
Why did you pick the one at the end?


1185
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,250
[He picked a special card,
what's the result?]


1186
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,550
- It's really good!
- It's good?


1187
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:21,119
[The best compatibility!]


1188
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,489
What did I tell you?


1189
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:25,530
- I finally found my partner!
- I give you, and you take it.


1190
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:28,230
You might feel a little pressure, but...


1191
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,730
it's joyful and happy.


1192
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:32,099
Like you're cuddled by mother.


1193
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:35,099
It means you're strongly united.


1194
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:39,710
- It's so true.
- They're the strongest partners.


1195
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:44,210
[It's Kkuk's turn.]
[He has someone in mind and picks.]


1196
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,550
We pick the cards,
according to our fortune.


1197
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:50,889
It's really fascinating.


1198
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:52,889
You hurt each other emotionally.


1199
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:55,760
Emotionally?
Who is it?


1200
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,730
It's hard to lead that person.


1201
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:03,130
Even if the result is good,
you might still feel hurt.


1202
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,469
- You little...
- It's me?


1203
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:08,500
I've always felt hurt!


1204
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,239
Not one time, I was unhurt!


1205
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:15,179
[He's the best partner for Kwang Soo...]


1206
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:18,179
Did I really do that?


1207
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:20,610
Jong Kook is a good partner
for Kwang Soo, but...


1208
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,550
Kwang Soo's not a good
partner for Jong Kook.


1209
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:25,519
[I need him to win at games...]


1210
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,789
This is only for the games,
not for the whole life.


1211
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:30,889
Just for the games.


1212
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:32,929
Let's just think about today.


1213
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:35,500
It's really good with this person.


1214
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,260
- Perfect!
- It is?


1215
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,230
For you, he's a really good partner.


1216
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,300
I thought about Gary.


1217
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,869
You did?


1218
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,909
Even the Tojung's book
said you too are good.


1219
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:49,780
- He said it's good if I control him.
- You need to invest!


1220
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,440
[It's about games, not investments.]


1221
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,679
[After Tojung's fortune telling, tarot
reading says they're good partners.]


1222
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:58,449
We didn't know you two
are good partners.


1223
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:04,460
Are you thirsty, Suk Jin?


1224
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,420
Can we let Suk Jin go home?


1225
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,800
I have plans for two things,
but my fortune tells me it's a bad idea.


1226
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,860
You have one more person.


1227
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,769
It'll be me!


1228
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:17,800
You'll see thunder.


1229
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,369
For both of us.


1230
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:23,979
[The history of Running Man]


1231
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:27,250
[is the history of the two rivals.]


1232
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,220
[Ttuk and Kkuk conflict with each other
at every single thing they do.]


1233
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:34,079
[How will be the result
of the tarot reading?]


1234
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:38,510
With this person...


1235
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:42,510
you'll have hard times.


1236
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:46,960
You're better off with me!


1237
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,729
I told you I'm better partner for you!


1238
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:51,970
Yes, it's really tiring.


1239
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:54,939
It's been tiring for me, too.


1240
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:56,670
On top of that, you need to wear a mask.


1241
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:01,399
You're tired, but you need to
pretend you're not.


1242
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:10,020
This is how our relationship is anyway!


1243
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,770
Jong Kook is wearing a mask now!


1244
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,149
[It seems they're perfect partners!]


1245
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:21,460
I started from there, but ended up here.


1246
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,399
[It's Jae Suk's turn.]
It's interesting!


1247
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,079
We're more and more serious.


1248
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:31,340
With this person, it's
neither good nor bad.


1249
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,939
Today, you get good result,
tomorow you get bad result.


1250
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:35,239
Who is it?


1251
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,880
Lee Kwang Soo.


1252
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,550
[I knew it!]


1253
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:44,020
I always worry he'd betray me!


1254
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,590
He's on the other team tomorrow!


1255
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:50,189
I'm on your side!


1256
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:51,789
This is so accurate!


1257
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,100
He change his sides all the time!


1258
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,699
Among all, this person is
the best partner for you.


1259
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:03,569
Gary!


1260
01:10:03,569 --> 01:10:06,470
I can do anything for you!


1261
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,180
We have a high winning rate together!


1262
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,750
- Gary told me that before.
- It's true.


1263
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,189
Jae Suk is actually
okay with any members.


1264
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:21,420
No one has bad compatibility with you.


1265
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,989
Lastly...


1266
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:26,930
with this person,
I think it's the worst.


1267
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,430
You never know.


1268
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,470
With this person, you'll have
the short end of the stick.


1269
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,899
[Amazing!]


1270
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:39,369
- For real?
- It's so weird!


1271
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:43,840
[They're bad influence for each other.]


1272
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,880
[It's just for games,
so, we won't be partners for games.]


1273
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,720
I feel better now!


1274
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,819
- Don't feel bad!
- I don't!


1275
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,079
[Gary's still in panic from
the classic fortune telling.]


1276
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:00,229
With this person, it might be stressful


1277
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:04,680
- but as a result, you'll be happy.
- That's Jong Kook!


1278
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:07,300
[Jong Kook]
Really?


1279
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,300
It's the same for each other.

[A new Monday Couple for 2016?]


1281

This person's good, too.


1282
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:21,909
As a new partner,
you'll have good synergy.


1283
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:23,850

1284
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,250
I was thinking about Jae Suk.


1285

- It's funny!
- I can give you all!


1286

- Ji Hyo!

life with this game.

- Let me yield...
- It's okay, it doesn't matter.

- Just play with Ji Hyo.
- Thank you.

to be Ha Ha's partner.]
