00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:10,325
What? What are we doing?

5
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:11,879
One, two, three.

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,809
Tell us the appearance of someone who would go well with us.

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,409
Who here is taller than 170cm?

8
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:17,909
- I found the person! - What?

9
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:20,249
- We have to decide. - Who should we leave out?

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,209
- Take a picture... - Who should I eliminate?

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,709
This is so nerve-wrecking.

12
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:25,709
- Where is it? - Please!

13
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,809
I don't care as long as it isn't me.

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,909
- Really? - That's impossible.

17
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:37,719
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

18
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,879
- Don't just start with that. - My back...

19
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,609
- Tell us before you do that. - Well I just...

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,909
Tell us before you do that.

21
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,109
Tell you what?

22
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,479
Tell you what?

23
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,709
Haha, do you have any wishes for 2016?

24
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,709
- I wish all of you good health. - I see.

25
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,609
I hope you stay healthy and...

26
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:53,709
- happy this year. - That's right.

27
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,209
- That's right. - We should all stay healthy.

28
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,709
- We should all stay healthy. - That is my wish this year.

29
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,109
Gary, how about you?

30
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:02,109
Like Haha, I hope all of you stay healthy and happy...

31
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,309
- this year. - Okay.

32
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,879
Thank you. Jong Kook, how about you?

33
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:07,509
- I hope I stay healthy. - I see.

34
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,709
- Even healthier? - You're already very healthy.

35
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,709
- How can he be even healthier? - He'll live for 300 years.

36
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:14,919
- I need to live a long life. - I see.

37
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,809
- I'm sure all of you have lots... - Right.

38
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,809
- to say, but let's wrap it up. - All right.

39
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,979
Okay, I'm fine with that.

40
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,709
- Well, we have to... - Just stay put.

41
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:23,909
Seok Jin, just stay put.

42
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,809
- Let's start off... - Yes.

43
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,609
- the new year with a bang. - Let's start.

44
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,709
- Let's go that way. - Let's go.

45
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:30,909
- Yes. - Let's go.

46
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:35,209
(Today's special mission will soon be revealed.)

47
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:40,609
(This buffet restaurant is filled with mouth-watering food.)

48
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,709
- Didn't we do this before? - Wow.

49
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,509
What is this?

50
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,909
- Yes, there it is. - There it is.

51
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,609
- It's the... - It's the Food Bingo.

52
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,709
- It's the Food Bingo. - What is this?

53
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,079
- I love this game. - Wow.

54
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,609
- This is... - I'm very hungry.

55
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,909
- Last time... - What is this?

56
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,249
It's a buffet.

57
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:02,009
- We'll tell you about today's race. - Okay.

58
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,609
Today, with the viewers...

59
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,509
(With the...)

60
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,709
(viewers?)

61
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,379
You will play the Comment Avatar Race.

62
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,709
- What? - Comment Avatar?

63
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,009
(The Comment Avatar Race)

64
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,879
We prepared this game in order to communicate with...

65
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,409
our viewers and show how thankful we are.

66
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,709
Communication is important.

67
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,609
On the phones that will be given to you,

68
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,509
you will each have an active SNS account.

69
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,179
Are they our actual accounts?

70
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,409
No, we made fake accounts that you will use for the race.

71
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,319
Before you perform any mission,

72
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,979
you will post a description and a photo, then receive comments.

73
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,609
- Today, you will become... - Who should we eliminate?

74
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,109
- the avatars of the viewers. - In the black coat.

75
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,009
You can only perform actions based on the viewers' comments.

76
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,449
- What kind of comments? - This is going to be hard.

77
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,609
Based on the results, you will be given Running Balls.

78
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,009
You will either get punishment or luck.

79
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,779
(The ultra strong punishments are back.)

80
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,849
We have to wear these?

81
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,909
(Who will receive the first punishment of the year?)

82
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,309
It's all right to post one as a test, right?

83
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,909
- That's all right. - So?

84
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,309
- You can log into your account... - This is how you do it?

85
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,209
- This is what you call a comment? - I got it. That will do.

86
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,879
- It pops out when you press this. - How does it go?

87
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,279
- The comments are coming up. - These are the comments?

88
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,609
(You look so handsome!)

89
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,009
My face is swollen today.

90
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,749
(He's never been so awkward in front of a camera.)

91
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,109
I posted one.

92
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,209
(Post more pictures!)

93
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:46,709
This is tough.

94
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:50,009
I did it only for a moment, and I'm tired. I'm not meant for it.

95
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,749
Me neither.

96
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,209
(With Gary's help, Ji Hyo uploads her first post.)

97
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,909
I did it.

98
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,509
(You make a good couple.)

99
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,409
(You are so handsome!)

100
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,979
(Please be nice to me today!)

101
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,479
(Go, Haha.)

102
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,849
(Go, Seok Jin!)

103
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,279
(This account is for today's show. Hello, Jong Kook!)

104
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:24,409
(Everyone has finished learning how to use it.)

105
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,579
(The first mission is Food Bingo.)

106
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,119
I only have three minutes. Can I pick anything?

107
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,279
I love all of these.

108
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,379
(He can pick only 25 out of all dishes.)

109
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,009
Marinated crab!

110
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,119
There are so many delicious dishes here.

111
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,709
This is crazy.

112
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,009
One.

113
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,479
Wait. Wait. Is this any good?

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,509
(Eating)

115
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,209
(Haha chooses what he likes.)

116
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,119
I can't choose!

117
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,879
One, two, three, four.

118
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,909
(It's filled with food I love!)

119
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,209
This is really crazy.

120
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,809
They are leaving many comments.

121
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,809
Kwang Soo got 120 comments as soon as he posted one.

122
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:05,909
They are...

123
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,619
- all very nice. - Ji Hyo got 700 comments.

124
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,409
She got 800 comments.

125
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,009
- This is too difficult. - This is really tough.

126
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,909
- The letters are too small. - How does it work?

127
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,479
I really love this.

128
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:21,909
Thank you for the food.

129
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,119
Pasta.

130
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:27,309
Spaghetti. Of course I'll take both.

131
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,909
I love spaghetti. There's no jjolmyeon, right?

132
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,809
They all look so delicious.

133
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:34,909
Gosh.

134
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,879
(Exclaiming with joy)

135
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,679
Salmon sushi.

136
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,109
I should choose the ones many people would like.

137
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,709
What would I eat if I were a viewer?

138
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,109
I should choose the food people generally love.

139
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:52,809
Tuna sushi.

140
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,909
I have to take what they are not taking.

141
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,909
I need to get kimchi.

142
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:03,309
Oh my gosh.

143
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,009
They all look delicious.

144
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,309
What do I do?

145
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,009
Do I have to arrange them in the order of preference?

146
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,779
Wait. Just put them down first.

147
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,509
Just arrange it randomly.

148
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,379
I won't be the one to choose.

149
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,109
- I will arrange it in the order. - Let's put the most delicious one.

150
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,909
You can freely arrange them.

151
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,309
First, you have to take a picture of your dishes.

152
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:26,679
When you post the picture, ask them which food you should eat.

153
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:30,109
You will read the first comment and eat the food.

154
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,909
- We read the first comment? - That's right.

155
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,109
The very first comment.

156
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,279
(First round is Food Bingo.)

157
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,309
- Please post it. - Hold on. I'm posting it now.

158
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,609
- Okay. - Okay.

159
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,879
- Please. - I posted it.

160
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,709
- So you eat what the comment... - What's the first comment?

161
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,109
Read the first comment.

162
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,809
- What is it? - Please!

163
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,709
- Please! - How can we...

164
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,009
- Where is it? - It's up.

165
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,909
- Please. - Please. But...

166
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,379
a lot of people will comment.

167
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,109
I know.

168
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,309
- I got one. - Okay.

169
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,579
It's oyster.

170
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,709
- Wow! - Yes!

171
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,109
- It's oyster! - Yes!

172
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:04,149
(They have it too!)

173
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,309
I didn't get that.

174
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,109
- I took it because I had no time. - I forgot it.

175
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:09,709
- I don't like raw oysters. - Me neither.

176
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,409
- I don't eat it. - I don't eat raw oysters.

177
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,879
Kwang Soo, take the picture and post it online.

178
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,909
- Okay. - It looks very nice.

179
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,709
Can't we take pictures ahead of time?

180
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,609
But different food disappears each time.

181
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,509
That was stupid of me to say.

182
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:25,909
Gosh.

183
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,779
- Gosh. - I posted it.

184
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,109
What is it? Please!

185
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,279
- Please choose this. - Just give me one.

186
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:33,879
It is...

187
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,209
What is it?

188
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,679
(Number 10)

189
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,679
- Gosh. - What is it?

190
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,409
- Korean pancakes. - What?

191
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,809
- Bravo! - Okay.

192
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,209
- Korean pancakes? - Yes!

193
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:46,909
- This counts too, right? - Right.

194
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,009
- Chive pancakes count. - It's delicious.

195
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:50,109
(Thanks to those comments, they get to eat.)

196
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,579
It's delicious.

197
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,109
Why would you eat Korean pancake?

198
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,609
This. This.

199
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,479
This is bad. I didn't get anything two times in a row.

200
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,649
This is it, right?

201
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,579
- How many do we have to make? - We have to make two lines.

202
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,009
- Two is not going to be easy. - I know.

203
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:04,209
(Why don't I tease Seok Jin a bit?)

204
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,109
What was that?

205
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,309
(What just happened?)

206
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:11,849
Something sharp came out.

207
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,009
(Jae Seok teases Seok Jin.)

208
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,009
Hey!

209
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,109
(Even in the new year, it's still fun to tease Seok Jin.)

210
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,309
- Hey... - I was...

211
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,209
I thought you'd change in 2016.

212
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,509
I will post the picture.

213
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,579
- I need to get one. - Please. Please.

214
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:35,009
I will post it and refresh it.

215
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,749
- What is it? - I will go with this one.

216
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,309
- What is it? - It's this one.

217
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,409
It's inari sushi.

218
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,909
- Oh yes! - No!

219
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,109
(Gary, Ji Hyo and Haha succeed.)

220
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,719
- I forgot to get that. - How did I forget it?

221
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,479
- This is crazy. - I don't have inari sushi.

222
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,679
You didn't bring that?

223
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,009
- But now... - I've had none for three rounds.

224
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,009
- It's going to be tough. - I got it.

225
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:02,649
Jae Seok, you can say "post it"...

226
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,649
to the phone.

227
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,749
You really think of me as an idiot, don't you?

228
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,219
- Actually... - This is it, right?

229
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,109
- Look at this, and pull it down. - Pull it down.

230
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,009
Read the one at the top. The first comment.

231
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,909
Oh! Here it is.

232
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,809
- What is it? - It's takoyaki.

233
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,109
- Yes! - Which one is it? The round one?

234
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,379
- This is it, right? - Yes.

235
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,909
- Jae Seok, hold it up. - Is this the one?

236
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,309
(Everyone has it...)

237
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,849
(apart from Jong Kook.)

238
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,309
Jong Kook failed four times.

239
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,909
- How is that possible? - What did you even bring?

240
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,509
What do you have?

241
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,879
I already gave up.

242
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,719
Mine are all so spread out.

243
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,309
Eating more of them is not important.

244
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,879
- Their location is more important. - Yes.

245
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,909
I reloaded it. I can choose the one on top, right?

246
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,749
- Yes. - The one on top.

247
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,219
Just choose what you want.

248
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,279
- Salmon sushi. - Yes!

249
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,379
- Salmon sushi. - Yes!

250
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,219
- Wait. Salmon sushi! - This is it, right?

251
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,509
- Isn't this the one? - That's not it.

252
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,409
That's not sushi. That's a roll.

253
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,609
- Hey. - This is it, right?

254
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,609
- I knew it. - I don't eat raw food.

255
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,749
They said you will help me a lot in 2016.

256
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,009
I shouldn't have picked the food I want to eat. Gosh.

257
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,879
Reload it.

258
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,309
(Number 17)

259
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,609
- Oh! - You have it?

260
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,749
- Yes. - What is it?

261
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,009
- Pineapples! - Yes!

262
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:25,009
- Why would you eat pineapples? - Why would you eat that?

263
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,219
Pineapples.

264
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,279
(Gary and Kwang Soo got it.)

265
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,679
- I didn't see pineapples. - Why would you eat that?

266
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:32,909
- Why would you eat fruit? - That's for dessert.

267
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,109
(I didn't pick it.)

268
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,749
- I should see it by now. - You eat dessert first?

269
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,509
- I have to stay near. - Pineapples!

270
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,909
- Pineapples. - I am too hungry to eat pineapples.

271
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,309
It's over. I just got to eat one.

272
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,909
One is not enough.

273
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,479
So now they will look at the cards and help me.

274
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,909
Right. Or they could ruin you.

275
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,479
(It depends on the comment.)

276
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:54,219
- I posted the picture. - Okay.

277
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,409
- Please! - The timing is important.

278
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,909
Be honest.

279
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,909
All right. I reloaded it.

280
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:03,849
- What's wrong? - Marinated crab.

281
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,409
- Yes! - Yes!

282
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,909
- Marinated crab! - Yes!

283
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:11,509
- I almost picked that. - Isn't this the one?

284
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,909
- That's not it. - That's not the one.

285
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,409
- That's fried. - That's fried crab.

286
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,909
- I said marinated crab. - This is marinated crab.

287
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,509
It needs sauce.

288
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,409
That's fried crab.

289
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,279
It's too salty without rice.

290
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,809
Don't eat raw food. It's not good for you.

291
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:34,909
(Bingo status)

292
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,409
(They are so cute!)

293
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,849
(Hello, Gary and Ji Hyo!)

294
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,409
(What's your mission, Seok Jin?)

295
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,709
(Where are you? Are you in the toilet?)

296
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,509
Now put your cellphones down.

297
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,009
- Haha will begin. - Say what you want.

298
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,779
Here we go. Are you ready?

299
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,009
- Yes. - Yes.

300
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,379
- Pizza! - Pizza!

301
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,979
- What did you say? - Pizza.

302
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,649
- Pizza. - Pizza.

303
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,309
- That's it! - Everyone except Jong Kook got it.

304
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:04,679
Jong Kook, did you eat anything yet?

305
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,279
You all are so different from me.

306
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,649
(I know.)

307
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,009
This pizza is made with squid ink.

308
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:13,809
Oh? I am sorry, Gary.

309
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,649
(Did someone call me?)

310
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,279
I think this might be popular.

311
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,609
(It's better to choose the one the others don't have.)

312
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,879
Fried eel.

313
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,849
- Yes. - Fried eel!

314
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:25,909
Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I got six.

315
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:29,479
Grilled squid.

316
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,749
- Let me see that. - I have it.

317
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,409
(I have it.)

318
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,509
(Finally, Jong Kook got to eat something.)

319
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,979
- See? It's Round One, right? - That's it.

320
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,679
- It's your species. - Wait.

321
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,649
Crab meat and sea urchin roe.

322
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,379
It's the one with salmon on top, right?

323
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:47,209
- Isn't this the one? - Isn't this the right one?

324
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,309
This is it, right?

325
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,909
- Is it this one? - It's this one, right?

326
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:51,549
Seok Jin, it's not that one.

327
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,149
It's not.

328
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,309
Was there something else other than this?

329
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,209
- It's not that one. - It isn't?

330
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,749
What about this one?

331
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,079
(Clattering)

332
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:02,749
(Surprised)

333
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,909
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

334
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,279
Hey!

335
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,649
- What's up with you? - What are you doing?

336
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:08,949
I tripped.

337
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,249
Gosh.

338
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,649
We're eating.

339
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,349
That's so annoying.

340
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:14,549
What's up with you?

341
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:16,179
It's not that one.

342
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,649
- Jong Kook, what would you pick? - Pick that one.

343
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,649
- Should I? - Yes, pick that one.

344
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:22,549
- Something healthy. - I'll pick this one.

345
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:23,849
Yes, pick something healthy.

346
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:25,279
Soft tofu.

347
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,849
(Soft tofu)

348
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,749
(We're at a seafood buffet.)

349
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,309
- Why would you eat tofu here? - Seriously.

350
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,549
- I wasn't expecting this. - Oh, here.

351
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:34,649
I have soft tofu.

352
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:35,849
Kimchi tofu doesn't count?

353
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,149
Did they have soft tofu on the menu?

354
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:39,849
Was there soft tofu?

355
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:41,349
- I'll pick one. - Okay.

356
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:43,349
Ji Hyo, pick a good one.

357
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:44,749
- All right. - Please.

358
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,249
Tomato with mozzarella cheese.

359
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,309
- No. - I had almost picked it up.

360
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,749
- Tomato with mozzarella cheese - Tomato with mozzarella cheese

361
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,149
(What's that?)

362
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,449
- Was it really there? - Yes.

363
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,409
Girls love it.

364
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,349
- Gary. - It's Gary's turn.

365
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:02,809
- Yes. - Go for something expensive.

366
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,249
Let's see.

367
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,349
What about ox feet?

368
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:07,749
I'd go for tomato sauce spaghetti.

369
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,109
- Yes! - I have it here!

370
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,549
(Gary completed one column.)

371
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:13,749
Tomato sauce spaghetti.

372
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,079
I'd go for tomato sauce spaghetti.

373
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,209
Yes!

374
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,949
I had almost picked that one up but changed my mind.

375
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,549
- I have tomato sauce spaghetti. - Me, too.

376
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,749
We have completely different tastes.

377
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:24,949
(Only the four young members had tomato sauce spaghetti.)

378
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,549
Raise your hand when you have two complete lines.

379
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,709
This round, let's go back to the SNS.

380
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,149
It's about time I complete a line.

381
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,209
It's difficult.

382
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,109
Can I mention which one I want?

383
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,279
No, you can't.

384
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,209
- Why not? - No, you can't.

385
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,549
- Why can't I do that? - SNS is all about communication.

386
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:44,749
Keep your eye on them and check if they mention a number.

387
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:45,909
(Now, it all depends on the commenters again.)

388
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:47,049
Which one should I eat?

389
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,749
- I'd like those dumplings. - Which one should I eat?

390
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,079
Ask which one to eat.

391
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,209
(Will the comments be helpful?)

392
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,709
- I'm done. - What number did you get?

393
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,209
(Which one should I eat?)

394
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,349
- It must take some time to load. - Oh, now I got it.

395
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,649
- Please! - Okay!

396
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,749
What number is it?

397
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,179
(Number 1)

398
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,749
- Be honest. - It's mandarins.

399
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:03,949
- What? - Yes!

400
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:06,349
- Mandarins! - Is that what the comment says?

401
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,909
- Mandarins! - Yes, it is.

402
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,349
It was in the comment. Look at this.

403
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:10,909
I had almost picked mandarins up.

404
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,949
They really told me to eat mandarins.

405
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,309
Haha seems to have almost completed a line.

406
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:16,249
- Gary. - Yes.

407
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,149
I hope I'll get one of these ones.

408
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,909
(Gary almost completed two lines.)

409
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:22,649
I'll refresh the comments. In 3, 2, 1.

410
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,549
Be honest. Don't pick the one that's good for you.

411
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,549
(Number 7)

412
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,549
Be honest.

413
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:29,749
Why would anyone pick this one?

414
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,179
- Shouldn't someone check on him? - What did you get?

415
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,309
Someone should watch him.

416
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:35,549
Why this one?

417
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,809
Come on.

418
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,549
(Number 7)

419
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,009
- What did you get? - Sorry?

420
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,249
- What did you get? - Tofu kimchi.

421
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,749
- Yes! - Yes!

422
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,709
This spot is so random.

423
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,649
- Yes! - Yes!

424
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,549
This spot is so random.

425
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,849
- Tofu kimchi it is. - It's obvious...

426
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,949
which one I should pick right now.

427
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:53,549
Gosh.

428
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,109
Why didn't I bring tofu kimchi?

429
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,349
Someone even picked a number that's already taken.

430
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,209
It's obvious which ones you should pick.

431
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,449
It's about time I complete a line.

432
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:05,349
- Please. - Let's see!

433
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,849
Okay, I got it.

434
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,279
(Number 22)

435
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,449
Octopus sushi.

436
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:13,049
Nice!

437
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,949
- I had put it back down. - Octopus sushi.

438
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,349
I was going to take that.

439
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,709
Why didn't I take octopus sushi?

440
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,079
- Jae Seok has eaten so much. - I know.

441
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,849
I ate seven and I still have no complete line.

442
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,749
I ate so much but they were too random.

443
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,179
I just need one more to finish the line.

444
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,149
What if they don't choose this one?

445
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:32,449
(There is only one left.)

446
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:35,349
But the commenters are quite mischievous.

447
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,909
They'll know when they see the picture.

448
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:38,749
(If he gets number 21 this time, the line will be completed.)

449
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:39,809
- I need just one more. - But...

450
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,549
Wait. It's this one, right?

451
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,449
- Refresh just once. - Okay.

452
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,449
(Number 21)

453
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,079
It's this one.

454
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:49,749
This one!

455
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,349
It was a smart choice.

456
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,449
It's grapes!

457
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,709
Did they have grapes?

458
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,179
(No grapes)

459
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,709
I have grapes but it doesn't help so much.

460
00:16:58,749 --> 00:16:59,749
(Jong Kook and Jae Seok seem to have similar tastes.)

461
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,449
I'm so lucky.

462
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,649
(Jae Seok completed a line.)

463
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,349
Thank you.

464
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,179
It was going so well but then it stopped.

465
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,749
I should give the commenter something in return.

466
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,049
Thank you so much.

467
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,849
(Take my heart in return.)

468
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,649
(He seems to be getting hooked on SNS.)

469
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:19,809
- I can't stand it. - What are you talking about?

470
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,949
What did I do wrong?

471
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,549
- I'm getting jealous. - You should slow down.

472
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,949
It was going so well but then it stopped.

473
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,179
This is so slow.

474
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:29,849
Kids must not like this dish.

475
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,149
I'm worried.

476
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,809
There's no chance they'll pick this one.

477
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,279
(Is that kimchi? Eat kimchi with rice.)

478
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,149
- This is so slow. - I'm already full,

479
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,349
but I haven't completed a line.

480
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,049
(Kwang Soo, you must be full. Stop eating!)

481
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:42,549
Would there be anyone who completed a line?

482
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,549
Haha seems to have finished a line.

483
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,049
Ready!

484
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,449
- Please. - In 3, 2...

485
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,349
- Please. - In 3, 2, 1.

486
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,649
I'm not playing any tricks.

487
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,179
- What did you get? - Which number?

488
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,309
What are they thinking?

489
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,419
(What are they thinking?)

490
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,809
Hey, don't be rude.

491
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:01,919
(Jong Kook is scolding the commenter.)

492
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,049
Serves you right!

493
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:04,809
It serves you right!

494
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:06,749
Don't think everyone on your page is your fan.

495
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,079
Why would anyone pick this one?

496
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,349
(Why would anyone pick this one?)

497
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:11,449
What did you get?

498
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,249
I don't understand.

499
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,079
- Egg sushi. - Yes!

500
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,249
Yes!

501
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,049
(We're happy!)

502
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,449
I'm so lucky.

503
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:21,649
Did they have egg sushi?

504
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,279
They sure did.

505
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,749
My goodness.

506
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,709
Jae Seok is doing so well.

507
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:28,949
Why are they being mean here?

508
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,919
I have a bad feeling.

509
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,309
What if they don't pick this one?

510
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,749
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

511
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,049
Wait.

512
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:39,649
Ji Hyo, tell us what it is.

513
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,749
Why are they doing this?

514
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:47,279
I'll eat number 2.

515
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,949
Sorry, number 2 is...

516
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,449
braised pollack.

517
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:52,109
- What? - What's braised pollack?

518
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:54,179
- They pick nothing I have. - Braised pollack.

519
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,109
- They have to pick this one. - Oh, it's here.

520
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:57,279
(If Gary gets number 5, he'll win the game.)

521
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:58,849
Gary, please.

522
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,179
What did you get?

523
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,349
Wait a second.

524
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,749
- I haven't got it yet. - Gary.

525
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,109
- Gary. - Gary.

526
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,179
I haven't even got the comment yet.

527
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,449
- Gary. - Gary.

528
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,649
You guys have to pick this one.

529
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,849
Okay.

530
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,649
(Number 5, please.)

531
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,049
(What...)

532
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,949
(did the commenters...)

533
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,809
(choose?)

534
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,149
Number 5!

535
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:26,849
Kimchi!

536
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,919
(Number 5, kimchi)

537
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,279
Bingo!

538
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:32,749
Kimchi!

539
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,179
Bingo!

540
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,349
(Gary finished the game first.)

541
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:38,549
- Are you finished? - Kimchi.

542
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:39,749
- Are you finished? - Yes.

543
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,449
- I'm not lying. - I do have kimchi.

544
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,749
You see?

545
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,549
Salmon!

546
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,179
- Salmon! - Salmon!

547
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,649
- Okay! - Did they have it?

548
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:48,749
- Okay, salmon. - Bingo!

549
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,009
Bingo!

550
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,279
(Ji Hyo completed two lines.)

551
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,549
Ji Hyo, really?

552
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,279
- Kwang Soo. - Hey.

553
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:58,809
You're so bad.

554
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,079
What are you doing?

555
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,209
Are you eating anything?

556
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,709
(What kind of food did you pick?)

557
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:05,849
(Angry)

558
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,449
Fried rice, bingo!

559
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,749
Fried rice.

560
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,449
(Jae Seok completed two lines.)

561
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,249
(Jae Seok receives two Running Balls.)

562
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:19,749
Wait.

563
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:21,749
Kwang Soo almost finished all his food,

564
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:23,449
- but still doesn't have two lines. - I only need one more.

565
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,179
Why aren't they choosing this one?

566
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,749
For me, they have many options.

567
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,949
I'm going to check the page.

568
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,009
Why no bingo?

569
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,279
Why are they doing this?

570
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,249
Almost all his food is gone.

571
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,349
They're not helping us.

572
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:35,709
- He's almost there. - What's up with them?

573
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,209
Do they have something against me?

574
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,349
This one is not bad.

575
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,249
This one.

576
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:44,449
Cold jellyfish salad.

577
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,109
- Okay, bingo! - Bingo!

578
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,449
Cold jellyfish salad.

579
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,449
- Okay, bingo! - Bingo!

580
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,709
Bingo!

581
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,109
- Bingo! - Bingo!

582
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,649
Did you finish with cold jellyfish salad, too?

583
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:56,919
It was the last one for me.

584
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,049
Is this possible?

585
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:00,279
Cold jellyfish salad was number 5.

586
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,209
(Now, it's time to decide who will be the last one to finish.)

587
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:03,649
- Okay. - Let's go.

588
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,049
I'll upload the picture.

589
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,649
If I don't get number 25 this time, I'm doomed.

590
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,449
It's been a long time since I needed number 25.

591
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:11,849
Please.

592
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,949
They can't choose anything else than number 25.

593
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,549
If the commenters know how Kwang Soo is,

594
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
they'll not choose number 25.

595
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:17,919
They shouldn't.

596
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,649
There's no other option. I've been waiting for so long.

597
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:20,809
I'll refresh it.

598
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:22,949
- What number is it? - Please.

599
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,649
Please.

600
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,149
(Will he get number 25...)

601
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,179
(this time?)

602
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:42,649
- What number is it? - Please.

603
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:44,549
- Please. - Yes!

604
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:47,749
(It's number 25.)

605
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,809
He got number 25.

606
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,179
I got number 25!

607
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:52,249
- No way. - He got it.

608
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,079
The next commenter said number 13.

609
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:55,349
It was close.

610
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,909
The next commenter said...

611
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,849
number 13.

612
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,549
They picked the ox feet in the centre...

613
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,279
so randomly.

614
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:03,849
It was so close.

615
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:05,349
Only if you had refreshed it once more.

616
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,149
Oh, it's this one.

617
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,249
(The number of Running Balls depends on the result of the game.)

618
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,449
- It's been a long time. - Oh, this one.

619
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,749
Then is Jong Kook getting no ball at all?

620
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,449
So you all have your Running Balls now.

621
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,109
- Thank you. - Am I getting one ball?

622
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:19,579
How are we supposed to carry them around?

623
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:20,949
Do it well.

624
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:26,349
(I hope you stay on SNS. Nice to be able to talk to you.)

625
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,009
I guess we don't have any guests today?

626
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,349
Are we going by car?

627
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,549
- It seems so. - What's this?

628
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,709
Car number one.

629
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,009
- Car number two. - Are we supposed to choose?

630
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,209
Can we get on whichever car we want to?

631
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,649
You have to ask the commenters which car you should get on.

632
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,749
Really?

633
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:40,309
Seriously?

634
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,549
It's unbelievable.

635
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:42,849
What if we all end up in one car?

636
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:44,349
I'm new to SNS.

637
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:45,849
This is too much.

638
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,549
Take a picture of both cars.

639
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,049
- Excuse me. - Go back a little.

640
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,349
- Excuse me. - Move back.

641
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,949
(They try to take good pictures.)

642
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:54,879
- Go this way. - Get out of my way.

643
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:56,679
What's this?

644
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,049
- Come on. - I should say the colour.

645
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:00,149
- Do it like before. - That's why.

646
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,679
- Yes. - Let's do it at the same time.

647
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,609
- Okay. - Got it.

648
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,609
- Let's do it. - Not yet.

649
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,049
- Not yet. - In one...

650
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,249
- Not yet. - In one...

651
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:10,779
- Hey! - In one, two...

652
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,049
- and three! - Wait.

653
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,409
- I need a question mark. - It's up.

654
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:14,709
- It's uploaded. - It's done.

655
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:16,749
For goodness' sake.

656
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,249
- It's up. - Yes.

657
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:19,549
Is it done?

658
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,249
- Refresh the feed. - How do I do this?

659
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:23,249
- Like this. - Scroll down.

660
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,679
- Mine's not working. - Scroll it down.

661
00:23:25,749 --> 00:23:27,449
- This is the new post. - You should use SNS...

662
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:28,949
- more often. - It's not that.

663
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:30,249
(You're too bothersome.)

664
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,649
- Use this. - Capture this.

665
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,049
- Push this. - No.

666
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:34,509
- Screen capture comes later. - Look.

667
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,749
- I already did it. - I see.

668
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:36,949
- I have red. - We'll do it at the same time.

669
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,049
- She says at the same time. - Not yet.

670
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,849
- I did it already. - We'll go again.

671
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,879
- I did it. - Do it at the same time.

672
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:43,709
- I don't know. - Please listen!

673
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:45,249
- But how? - Let's do it together.

674
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,509
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

675
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:48,809
- Okay. - It's done.

676
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:50,349
- What's the first comment? - Red one.

677
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:51,509
- Red one. - Red one.

678
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,049
- Red car. - Red car.

679
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:54,449
The red car is in front. So everyone says red one.

680
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:55,549
- They're all red. - I have blue.

681
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,749
My comment says "Let's go, Kwang Soo!" so I'll go again.

682
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,349
- Okay. - Do it again.

683
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:00,609
- I don't know. - I got red.

684
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:01,679
- I'll go again. - What is it?

685
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,549
I got red.

686
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,449
- This and this. - I have red too.

687
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,679
- Let's pick one. - How many got red?

688
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:08,949
- Write the names down. - There are six reds.

689
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,349
- There are six. - Yes.

690
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,349
- Only four can get in. - Yes.

691
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,709
- They have to decide. - We'll ask the followers...

692
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,309
- who will ride the blue car. - Kwang Soo can do it.

693
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:18,009
- I'll upload it. - We have to be in the picture.

694
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,909
- Take a picture. - With us in it.

695
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,709
- That's right. - Just the six people.

696
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,809
Look here.

697
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,149
(Choose wisely.)

698
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,409
I'll take it for you.

699
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,949
- I took it already. - It's okay.

700
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,409
Gary.

701
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,609
- I closed my eyes. - Gary looks really funny.

702
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,149
- Just upload it. - Hey.

703
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:34,909
- Hey, come on. - I'm sorry.

704
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:36,449
Oh, poor Gary.

705
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:39,449
- That's funny. - He looks funny.

706
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:42,249
- Look at his eyes. - I always take bad pictures.

707
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,449
Doesn't he look funny?

708
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:45,449
- Okay, I'll check. - Check the comments.

709
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,049
- Refresh the feed. - I'll do it.

710
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,709
- Refresh it. - Don't come too close.

711
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,149
- Be fair. - Okay.

712
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:52,749
- Be fair. - Why would I be unfair?

713
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:54,149
- Sometimes you are. - Just show it.

714
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:55,609
- Show it to everyone. - Show us.

715
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,679
- I refreshed the feed. - Okay.

716
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,609
- I'll do a screen capture. - Okay.

717
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,449
- What does it say? - Oh, no.

718
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,449
- What is it? - It's Gary.

719
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:06,509
- Is it? - Gary?

720
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,349
Scroll it down one more time.

721
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:09,449
I'll go one more time.

722
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,849
- Capture it. - Okay, okay.

723
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:11,909
(Who'll be kicked out of the red car?)

724
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,649
- Nice. - Who is it?

725
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,449
- Who is it? - Jong Kook.

726
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,009
- Yes! - That's great.

727
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,049
(Jong Kook will ride the blue car.)

728
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:20,649
- You two are a couple. - This team's awesome.

729
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,149
- Wow. - That's what I'm saying.

730
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:23,249
(Red: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Haha)

731
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:24,249
(Blue: Jong Kook, Gary, Ji Hyo)

732
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,949
We're leaving.

733
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:26,949
Here we go.

734
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,449
(Ilsan W Mall)

735
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:31,779
(They head to the next destination.)

736
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,779
- Let's go. - Okay.

737
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,149
(They head to the next destination.)

738
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,049
Do I hold on to the phone?

739
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:44,249
I think so. I think there will be another mission.

740
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:45,549
We're going the opposite way.

741
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:48,149
- They already started. - What are they doing?

742
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,149
I think we have to post something again.

743
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,249
What is it?

744
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,349
Take a selfie of yourselves.

745
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:58,549
Upload it and say, "A passer-by will play a game with us."

746
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,349
"Who should it be?"

747
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,349
"Tell us about their appearance."

748
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:03,809
- What kind of passer-by? - Jong Kook.

749
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:04,879
(They will find the person based on the comments.)

750
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,149
In one...

751
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:09,449
(He looks indifferent.)

752
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:10,949
(He grins.)

753
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,449
(Pouting)

754
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,149
Tell us with whom...

755
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:16,049
we should play a game.

756
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,149
Please write a detailed description of their appearance.

757
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:20,849
Okay, here we go.

758
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:22,409
(Team Jae Seok takes a selfie.)

759
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,909
(Please go easy on us.)

760
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,679
Okay, in 1, 2, 3.

761
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:31,249
Please tell us in detail who we should play a game with.

762
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:32,679
- Good. - I'll upload it.

763
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:35,449
You need to bring three people.

764
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,009
Someone 12 years younger than me.

765
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,609
This one's easy. Someone 12 years younger than me...

766
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,049
would've been born in 1988.

767
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,149
- A person with a nice body. - Okay.

768
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,049
- A person with a black hat. - Nice body?

769
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:50,779
- Or someone born in 1988? - Someone wearing blue clothes.

770
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,549
It'll be hard to find someone with blue clothes.

771
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,549
Is it better to find the right person quickly?

772
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,149
- Yes. - Really? We have to find them fast.

773
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,049
Blue clothes will be hard.

774
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,549
We just have to find two people.

775
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,649
- Right. Only two people. - It's easier for us.

776
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,049
A woman with long straight hair and a black coat.

777
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,779
A woman with long straight hair and a black coat.

778
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,249
- Just one person? - One person?

779
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:12,409
A woman who's taller than 170cm and has short hair.

780
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,049
- Someone over 170 cm. - Short hair.

781
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,079
Is anyone taller than 170cm with a short hair?

782
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,809
Is any lady taller than 170cm?

783
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,909
Is any lady taller than 170cm with a short hair?

784
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:23,149
Black coat.

785
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:24,779
(Finding the person faster is better for them.)

786
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:26,049
Is it a black coat?

787
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,249
- Is it a black coat? - Yes.

788
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:28,609
- It's a grey coat. - A grey coat.

789
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,549
- A black coat. - You have long straight hair?

790
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,649
- Straight hair? - Long hair?

791
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,309
- I'm sorry. - You have long hair, right?

792
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:35,409
- Long hair! - You have long hair.

793
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:36,949
- Great. - Come this way.

794
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,409
- Black coat. - Long hair.

795
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:42,049
Is anyone over 170cm and has short hair?

796
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:44,449
- Short hair and 170cm. - That's hard.

797
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,509
- Wait. - Are you over 170cm?

798
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,809
- No. - Okay, thanks.

799
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,779
- What do we do? - It's too hard.

800
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:53,609
- It's too hard. - It's too difficult.

801
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,709
Jae Seok, there was...

802
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,049
a comment telling us to find...

803
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:59,909
- someone taller than Kwang Soo. - Really?

804
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:01,949
- No way. - That would be impossible.

805
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,049
A strong person.

806
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,409
I think he looks strong.

807
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,949
- Me? - He's strong.

808
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:06,949
Jong Kook.

809
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:08,649
Please come with me.

810
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:11,149
- He looks strong. - Okay, good.

811
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,049
- Yes. - He was born in 1988.

812
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,249
He was born in 1988.

813
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,749
I'm wearing blue.

814
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:21,149
Let's see.

815
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,779
- She's wearing blue. - Show them.

816
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:23,949
- Yes. - It's too cold.

817
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,809
She's wearing bright blue.

818
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,449
- I found her! - You did?

819
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,579
- He found her! - Good!

820
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:30,849
- She's 170cm! - How did you find her?

821
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,549
- Really? - Where?

822
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,349
- How did you find her? - Really?

823
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:36,849
- Here. - She's 171cm.

824
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,609
Are you over 170cm?

825
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:39,679
That's great.

826
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:43,249
- Hello. - Come this way.

827
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,249
- You'll play a game with us. - Yes.

828
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,549
- It's a Tongue Twister game. - Okay.

829
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,049
Within a given time, everyone has to read the sentence out loud.

830
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,249
- Okay. - If anyone makes a mistake,

831
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,549
you need to start over as a team.

832
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:57,879
- Okay. - You have one minute.

833
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,749
Okay. Please pick one...

834
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,049
out of these two.

835
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,909
- Please pick one. - Yes, here.

836
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,049
- This one. - Okay.

837
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,749
We'll take this one.

838
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,249
Then we get this one.

839
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,249
(He drops it.)

840
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:15,409
Hey.

841
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,609
- What was that for? - Why did you do that?

842
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,809
- That's mean. - Hey.

843
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:18,949
(He's being mean.)

844
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,949
- You're a bully. - What's wrong with you?

845
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,309
- Why did you do that? - You're a bully.

846
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:25,949
(They get in a fight.)

847
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,049
Come here please.

848
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,549
Jong Kook. Do you want to go third?

849
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:31,649
- Shall I? - Let's shuffle.

850
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,049
Okay. Gary.

851
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:34,449
- You should go first. - Me?

852
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,409
- Gary is a good rapper. - He should go first.

853
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,149
- That doesn't matter. - Yes, you go first.

854
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,779
You're good at speaking.

855
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,779
- I am? - Right.

856
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,309
It's too cold. I don't know if I can move my lips quickly.

857
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,149
- We're ready. - You have one minute.

858
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:47,649
- Ready. - Ready.

859
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:50,309
(You need to be fast and...)

860
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:51,449
Set.

861
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,949
(articulate to win this game.)

862
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:55,549
Go!

863
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,809
Are the pea pods in the field open or not?

864
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:04,249
Does it matter if they're open? Whether they're open...

865
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:05,609
Whether they're open...

866
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,149
(Startled)

867
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,249
- What? - What's wrong?

868
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,349
He said it wrong.

869
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:13,949
Go again.

870
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,509
Are the pea pods in the field open or not?

871
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,549
Does it matter if they're open?

872
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,749
Whether they're open or not, they're all pea pods.

873
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:21,949
(Okay.)

874
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,849
Are the pea pods in the field open or not?

875
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,449
Does it matter if they're open?

876
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:29,649
Whether they're open or not, they're all pea pods.

877
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:33,479
Are the pea pods in the field open or not?

878
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,409
Does it matter if they're open?

879
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:38,749
Whether they're open or not,

880
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,049
- they're all pea pods. - Good!

881
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:43,149
Are the pea pods in the field open or not?

882
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:46,249
- Go slowly. - Does it matter if they're open?

883
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:49,049
Whether they're open or not, they're all pea pods.

884
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,709
- They're all good. - Are the pea pods in the field...

885
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,149
- open or not? - They're good.

886
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:54,349
- Good. - Does it matter if they're...

887
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:55,709
open?

888
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,049
- She's calm. - Whether they're open or not,

889
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,349
- they're all pea pods. - Good.

890
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,149
- Good. - Are the pea pods in the field...

891
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:04,049

Does it matter if they're open?

900
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,049
Whether they're open or not, they're all pea pods.

921
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:58,149
- Start. - Go slowly.

922
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,709
- Wow. - This is hard.

923
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,879

969
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,509
Why is this wrong?

970
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:53,749

- Let's do this. - We have to...

1027
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,949
- From the top. - It's black, not "brack".

1028
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:14,849

00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:39,479
Our village people...

1066
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:40,849
like all kinds of pea soup.

1067
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,149
My family likes black pea soup.

1068
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:44,749
But others don't like the soup that we like.

1069
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:45,949
- We did it. - Yes.

1070
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:47,549
- Did we win? - We don't know yet.

1071
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:50,409
- It's okay, we won. - It's all right.

1072
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,549
- Did we win? - We still beat them.

1073
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:53,749
- We won. - Good job, everybody.

1074
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,049
- They were fast. - Good job.

1075
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,049
- We were fast enough. - Good job.

1076
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,409
- Good job. This was a close one. - We don't know yet.

1077
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,549
- We don't know yet. - This is going to be a close call.

1078
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:01,949
- No, it's not. - This is a close one.

1079
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,379
The winners will get three Running Balls.

1080
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,909
The losers will get just one Running Ball.

1081
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:11,149
The team with Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo...

1082
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:12,249
came in at...

1083
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,049
(What's their record?)

1084
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:15,509
46.86 seconds.

1085
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,749
- Wow. We did well. - 46.86 seconds.

1086
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:20,749
- And Team Jae Seok... - I don't know...

1087
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,549
(Team Jae Seok's score will be revealed.)

1088
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:25,409
(Who will receive three Running Balls?)

1089
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,649
They came in at 50.25 seconds.

1090
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,009
(Team Jae Seok is disappointed.)

1091
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:36,349
(Team Jong Kook wins.)

1092
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,749
- All right. - Thank you.

1093
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,249
(Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo all receive three Running Balls.)

1094
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:44,209
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

1095
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:47,749
- Thank you so much. - You did a good job.

1096
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,109
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1097
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:55,349
(They're the best team. I will cheer you on.)

1098
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,849
(At a cafe in Janghang-dong)

1099
00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,249
You guys are all here, right?

1100
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,749
Before the final mission, we'll give you a mini mission.

1101
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:03,849
- Really? - Yes.

1102
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:07,379
This game will also utilise comments.

1103
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,949
Oh really? This should be fun.

1104
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:11,319
- This is the Comment Speed Quiz. - Wow.

1105
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:12,749
- Wow. - Wow.

1106
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:15,549
- This is so strange. - Wow.

1107
00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:18,849
But all my followers just goof around.

1108
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,449
My followers don't know much like me.

1109
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:24,209
You will provide your followers with the quiz questions.

1110
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,409
In this can, there are seven different adages.

1111
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:34,449
After you pick one out, you will film a video that explains it.

1112
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,609
The winners of this game will be decided based on...

1113
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,949
whoever gets the right answer first in the comments.

1114
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,749
If I win again, I will be legendary.

1115
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,849
How am I supposed to win when my followers goof around?

1116
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:47,749
I can't win because of you guys.

1117
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:50,009
- My followers are... - Then let's ask them...

1118
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:51,949
who should go first.

1119
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,649
- Let's take a picture. - That sounds good.

1120
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,509
- Okay, let's take a picture. - No, you're...

1121
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:58,009
addicted to SNS.

1122
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:02,479
- He's addicted. - It's all he can think about.

1123
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,279
- Let's take the picture here. - I realised that...

1124
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:05,849
I know my way around SNS.

1125
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,149
- Over here. - I'm so good at it.

1126
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,149
- Move back. - Come over here.

1127
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:13,249
- Let's all get in the photo. - Gary and Ji Hyo.

1128
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:17,609
- All right. - Then...

1129
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,209
who should go first?

1130
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,949
- Please choose the order. - Choose the order.

1131
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:22,549
Let's go.

1132
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:25,649
- It's not turned off. - Here we go.

1133
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:27,109
- Refresh the page. - I posted it.

1134
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:28,949
- There we go. - Seok Jin.

1135
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,849
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1136
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,649
- You're first. - Refresh the page.

1137
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:36,409
- We already did. Next is Kwang Soo. - Do it properly.

1138
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:38,949
- What? - Next is Gary.

1139
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:41,449
- The third is Gary. - Then, it's Jae Seok.

1140
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,849
- The fifth is Ji Hyo. - Now we will take your phones away.

1141
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,749
I need my phone because...

1142
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,049
I'm addicted to SNS.

1143
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:49,849
- I can't live without it. - Just come on in...

1144
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:52,049
to the world of SNS.

1145
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,149
You should use it more. I'll be your follower.

1146
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:56,449
- What an honour. - But I have to take pictures.

1147
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:57,909
I don't like getting my photo taken.

1148
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:00,949
(But he's been...)

1149
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:03,109
(taking selfies all day long.)

1150
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:05,749
You only have 10 seconds to explain with your body.

1151
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:07,379
You can't make sounds.

1152
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:10,209
(What is his adage?)

1153
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:13,279
- What is it? - Is it hard?

1154
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,479
- Guess what it is. - You have 10 seconds.

1155
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,849
- That's why... - You can't make any noise.

1156
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,049
Ready. Start.

1157
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,479
(He's panting.)

1158
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:29,049
(What on earth is this?)

1159
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,249
(What's up with his gesture?)

1160
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:33,209
- I get it. - I figured it out.

1161
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,349
This one is easy.

1162
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:36,409
- We're in trouble. - This is very easy.

1163
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,549
- This one was... - He did a really good job.

1164
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:40,509
- Did you figure it out? - I think Seok Jin was...

1165
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:41,949
putting dung over his body.

1166
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:44,379
He was trying to be the dung-stained dog?

1167
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:47,249
- Is it "He who smelt it, dealt it"? - He really tried...

1168
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:48,909
Is this hard to figure out?

1169
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:51,049
"The dung-stained dog reproaches the chaff-stained dog."

1170
00:41:51,149 --> 00:41:54,949
- That's correct. - Now the followers have to get it.

1171
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:57,149
But because this was a hard question...

1172
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:59,049
(Now they post the video.)

1173
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:03,649
(How long will it take for them to figure it out?)

1174
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:09,909
(Please get it right.)

1175
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:13,409
(Next up is Kwang Soo.)

1176
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,049
I think Seok Jin's adage was the easiest one.

1177
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,649
Kwang Soo may not know what the adage even means.

1178
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,149
- This one is hard. - Really?

1179
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,909
At least you're a good actor.

1180
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:24,049
- Go on, do it. - This is impossible.

1181
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,549
(Kwang Soo practises.)

1182
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:27,349
- Are you a dog? - He's a dog.

1183
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:28,509
It's a rat.

1184
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,549
(They can't figure it out.)

1185
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:36,549
- "Every rat has his bright day." - That's correct!

1186
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:38,649
- "Every rat has his bright day." - That's correct!

1187
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,379
- That's right. - This one is easy.

1188
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:43,279
You have 10 seconds. Get ready.

1189
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:44,949
- He's doing a good job. - Just do what you just did.

1190
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:46,109
- Just do what you just did. - Get set.

1191
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:55,979
(He tries his best to describe it.)

1192
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:57,849
The time...

1193
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,049
Time's up.

1194
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:04,049
- Stop. - Wait.

1195
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:06,009
He didn't get to describe the last part, "bright day".

1196
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,209
It ended with the rat.

1197
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,709
- How can you end it with the rat? - How can you...

1198
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:10,349
- How can you stop there? - But the rat part was tough.

1199
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:11,649
It was really tough to describe.

1200
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:13,649
You couldn't describe "bright day".

1201
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:14,749
It was hard to describe a rat.

1202
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,249
- Next up is Gary. - Gary.

1203
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,009
By the way,

1204
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:22,449
the ones who followed me today...

1205
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:24,549
- Wait. - We will guess it.

1206
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,609
It looks easy, but it's going to be tough.

1207
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:27,649
- Is that right? - What is it?

1208
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:30,109
It would have been easier with an animal.

1209
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:31,549
Show us.

1210
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,749
- Should I try it? - Give it a try.

1211
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:36,649
(He pretends to cut his throat.)

1212
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:38,449
- Squid walking on a tightrope. - Enemies...

1213
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:39,909
- Squid walking on a tightrope. - Enemies...

1214
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:42,509
"Enemies always meet on a tightrope."

1215
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:44,249
- You got it. - That was really easy.

1216
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,149
Why would you bring up squid there?

1217
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,009
It wasn't about squids?

1218
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:49,449
Goodness.

1219
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:50,879
What kind of an adage is that?

1220
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:52,879
- Tightrope-walking squid. - Tightrope-walking squid.

1221
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:54,949
Is this how squid walks on a tightrope?

1222
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,649
Tightrope-walking squid!

1223
00:43:57,649 --> 00:43:59,649
Here we go.

1224
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:01,249
(They will record a video for 10 seconds.)

1225
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:04,449
Ready. Go.

1226
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:08,249
(He's determined to defeat his enemy.)

1227
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,249
(He's good at expressing the tightrope.)

1228
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,509
That was perfect.

1229
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:19,349
- Good job. - That was perfect.

1230
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,149
People will know it.

1231
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:22,509
- It's perfect. - It's perfect..

1232
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:23,649
Gary is so good.

1233
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:25,009
- I'm next, right? - Jae Seok.

1234
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,109
I'm next.

1235
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:27,749
(Jae Seok is up next.)

1236
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:28,849
Please open the envelope.

1237
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:31,449
(Which adage did he pick?)

1238
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:32,749
It's easy but tricky.

1239
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:35,079
- We will try to guess it. - Gosh.

1240
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:36,849
Just give it a try.

1241
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,649
- It didn't start yet, right? - No, it didn't.

1242
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:41,009
(Watch carefully.)

1243
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,149
Watch me.

1244
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:43,709
Start.

1245
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,449
A cat.

1246
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:48,649
- A cat. - It's a cat.

1247
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:50,149
"The silent cat goes on top of the stove first."

1248
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:51,349
That's it!

1249
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:53,879
(Seok Jin got it.)

1250
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:56,449
This is the only adage you can think of.

1251
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:57,749
- Right. - Yes!

1252
00:44:57,909 --> 00:44:59,249
- I did it! - There's...

1253
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:00,349
- I did it. - You did it.

1254
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,949
- That was easy. - What else could it be?

1255
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:03,649
I'm jealous.

1256
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,849
Start.

1257
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:10,609
(Acting like a cat)

1258
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:12,749
(Jumping)

1259
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:19,979
Jumping, jumping

1260
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,909
It might not be easy.

1261
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:25,109
They might say, "Hard times are soon forgotten."

1262
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,209
I am sure someone will mention "Tom and Jerry".

1263
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:30,749
Someone's going to mention Seolhyun for sure.

1264
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:32,749
- AOA. - AOA.

1265
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:34,149
Someone will mention AOA.

1266
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,349
But that's not it.

1267
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,079
I couldn't meow.

1268
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:39,349
(The fifth player is Ji Hyo.)

1269
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:41,349
What's this? I haven't...

1270
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:43,249
What is it, Ji Hyo?

1271
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:45,079
- I will give it a try. - Okay.

1272
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:48,879
(Here and here.)

1273
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,009
Okay.

1274
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:51,979
(Dancing)

1275
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,149
- Grasshopper. - One man sows and...

1276
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:55,649
"One man sows and..."

1277
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:57,209
"another man reaps."

1278
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,249
No, the owner reaps?

1279
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,549
"Don't order others to do things at their own party."

1280
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:03,109
- What? - She's going to lose!

1281
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:04,249
It looked nothing like that.

1282
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:05,709
I will bet everything I have.

1283
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:09,009
- She's bad. - She's going to lose.

1284
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,549
- This is too difficult. - I will bet my life.

1285
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:11,979
Ji Hyo, you are ruined.

1286
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:13,449
This is too difficult for me.

1287
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:14,649
Ready.

1288
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:16,649
Start.

1289
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:18,249
This is a difficult adage.

1290
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,549
(She's describing other people.)

1291
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:21,879
You have 10 seconds. Hurry up.

1292
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:23,649
(She describes the party.)

1293
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,949
(She tries her best.)

1294
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,249
What's that?

1295
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:36,649
- Okay. - This is too difficult.

1296
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:38,079
- You're officially the loser. - Hey.

1297
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:39,749
I won't be the loser for sure.

1298
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,009
I will beat at least one person.

1299
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,649
- I'm relieved. - I just have to be a bit better.

1300
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:45,649
Just a little bit.

1301
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:47,909
(Will the followers of Ji Hyo surprise them with a twist?)

1302
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,049
Haha.

1303
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,449
Is it something difficult?

1304
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:54,249
Watch me and guess it.

1305
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,109
(He looks around.)

1306
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,749
(Oh!)

1307
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,549
Watch out before you lie down.

1308
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,049
That's it.

1309
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:04,549
Watch out before you lie down.

1310
00:47:04,649 --> 00:47:05,649
Yes.

1311
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:07,249
That's it.

1312
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,549
That was a good one.

1313
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,049
I described it well, didn't I?

1314
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:11,649
- It was really good. - He described it well.

1315
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:13,349
- That's a very kind description. - I'm going to lose!

1316
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:14,649
Hold your legs and stretch your knees.

1317
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:16,449
- Gosh. - The Great Mountain, they say...

1318
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:19,149
Nothing is more difficult than what Ji Hyo got.

1319
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,809
Ji Hyo's was the toughest one.

1320
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:23,149
Ji Hyo, yours was really difficult.

1321
00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:26,009
(Good clothes give you wings.)

1322
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:27,549
- It's a tough one, isn't it? - Is it difficult?

1323
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:28,649
- Is he the new loser? - Is it hard?

1324
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,349
I think you can guess it really fast.

1325
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:32,649
Is that right?

1326
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,749
- Hold on. - Jong Kook is good at this.

1327
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,809
Why are you taking off your clothes?

1328
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:37,209
- Here we go. - Okay.

1329
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:39,349
(This)

1330
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:41,079
A pervert.

1331
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:44,449
(These are my wings.)

1332
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:45,749
- I don't know what it is. - "You're inside me"?

1333
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:47,649
That was funny.

1334
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,009
A duck-down parka?

1335
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,109
(A duck-down parka?)

1336
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:51,249
(They keep giving wrong answers.)

1337
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:52,649
- Go on. - That's all.

1338
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:54,449
So you don't know it. People will get it right for sure.

1339
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:56,249
Ready. Go.

1340
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:01,649
(He's fluttering his wings.)

1341
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:06,049
(Oh!)

1342
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,209
I get it.

1343
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:10,749
He should've lifted the outer layer.

1344
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:13,549
(Please post your answers.)

1345
00:48:14,149 --> 00:48:17,109
(The seven videos have been uploaded.)

1346
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:21,749
(Which one of them will get the right answer first?)

1347
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:23,079
We have the result.

1348
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,509
I just hope I will be one of the top three.

1349
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,209
- Please. - Please.

1350
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:28,249
- Please. - Please.

1351
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:31,349
- I will announce the third place. - The third.

1352
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,149
- Being third is okay. - I want to be third.

1353
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:34,149
- I want to be third. - The third is good.

1354
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:35,649
- How many balls does he get? - How many balls?

1355
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:37,879
- He gets 2 balls. - You get 2 balls?

1356
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,349
- Two balls. - I won't get greedy.

1357
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,449
Two balls are enough.

1358
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:42,809
The right answer was on the 15th comment.

1359
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,809
- That was fast. - There were faster ones.

1360
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:48,009
(Winning the third place is safe.)

1361
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,009
(Which one will receive two extra Running Balls?)

1362
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,249
It's Gary.

1363
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:53,349
(Gary wins the third place.)

1364
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:54,349
Okay.

1365
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:55,649
I thought he would lose.

1366
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:57,349
Third place is good.

1367
00:48:57,449 --> 00:48:59,749
- I thought he'd win. - I get two balls.

1368
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,009
- Enemies... - I get two balls.

1369
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,149
Yes.

1370
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,109
He will also get two Running Balls.

1371
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,249
The fourth place will also get two Running Balls.

1372
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:08,549
- The fourth is all right. - I just want to be fourth.

1373
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:10,049
- Please. - Being fourth is good enough.

1374
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,809
The 18th comment had...

1375
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:14,749
- the right answer. - It's me.

1376
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:16,949
- Who is it? - It's Haha.

1377
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:18,149
(Haha wins the fourth place.)

1378
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,079
(Watch out before you lie down.)

1379
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:23,249
Two balls are enough.

1380
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:24,549
- This is crazy. - I know.

1381
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:26,909
I will announce the fifth place.

1382
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:28,649
- Does he get 1 ball? - Only 1 ball?

1383
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,149
The fifth and sixth get one ball each.

1384
00:49:31,149 --> 00:49:34,049
The 30th comment had the right answer.

1385
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:35,149
(The 30th comment had the right answer.)

1386
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:36,979
It's Kwang Soo.

1387
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:39,249
What was Kwang Soo's answer?

1388
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,709
- "Every rat has his bright day." - "Every rat has his bright day."

1389
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,449
That's about the only saying with a rat.

1390
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:45,009
(Is it "The pot calls the kettle black"?)

1391
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,849
He gets two balls?

1392
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:48,549
- Jae Seok's was really easy. - I get one.

1393
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:50,249
Was mine hard?

1394
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:52,049
- No, it was easy. - It was easy.

1395
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:53,549
- Jae Seok's was easy. - He'll be in second place.

1396
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:55,349
Don't worry. I'm the loser.

1397
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:57,849
- The sixth place. - It's me.

1398
00:49:58,809 --> 00:49:59,849
It's me.

1399
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:01,079
It's Jae Seok.

1400
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,809
Am I the second one?

1401
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,879
(The 34th comment had the right answer.)

1402
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:05,149
Am I the second one?

1403
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:06,979
Yes!

1404
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,909
Yes! What was yours?

1405
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:11,109
"The silent cat goes on top of the stove first."

1406
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,249
- Is that right? - I can't believe it.

1407
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,709
Was it hard?

1408
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:16,749
Now it's time to announce the winner and runner-up.

1409
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:17,879
I'm nervous.

1410
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,349
For the winner, the 13th comment had the answer.

1411
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,249
For the runner-up, the 14th comment had the answer.

1412
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:24,979
- That was close. - I will announce the winner.

1413
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:27,209
The 13th comment had the answer for the winner.

1414
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:29,079
It was the 14th comment for the runner-up.

1415
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:31,649
I'm out of luck this year.

1416
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:33,649
(Will it be Seok Jin?)

1417
00:50:33,749 --> 00:50:35,009
"Good clothes give you wings."

1418
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,949
(Or will it be Jong Kook whose adage was easy?)

1419
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:39,249
(Whose follower got the right answer first?)

1420
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:40,879
It's Seok Jin.

1421
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:42,749
- He's the winner? - Yes.

1422
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:44,509
He used up all his luck here?

1423
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:45,709
(He used up all his luck here?)

1424
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:47,249
Only bad things will happen to him now.

1425
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:48,609
I don't want to spend my luck here.

1426
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,849
- I'd rather not. - You won.

1427
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,609
I'm the winner.

1428
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,079
He used up all his luck here.

1429
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,449
The 13th comment had the answer.

1430
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:57,909
- Poor Seok Jin. - "The dung-stained dog..."

1431
00:50:57,979 --> 00:50:59,249
"reproaches the chaff-stained dog."

1432
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:01,909
Seok Jin tried hard to describe it well.

1433
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:03,979
He probably got...

1434
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:05,049
He didn't get many comments.

1435
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:06,709
For the last one, 167th comment had the answer.

1436
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:07,849
Someone actually got the answer?

1437
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:09,909
We should give that person a gift.

1438
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:11,049
Thank you.

1439
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:12,809
- Thank you. - Give him a gift.

1440
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:14,149
Reply to his comment.

1441
00:51:14,249 --> 00:51:15,349
He deserves to get a gift.

1442
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,009
He really deserves a gift.

1443
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,079
Let's move on to the next mission.

1444
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:20,149
Let's go!

1445
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:21,449
Give me the phone. I want to check my SNS.

1446
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:22,979
(Give me the phone. I want to check my SNS.)

1447
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:24,049
Give me back my phone.

1448
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,149
Don't do it.

1449
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,949
- I'm addicted. - We get to take our phone?

1450
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,609
They are waiting for me.

1451
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:30,979
They are waiting for my news.

1452
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:33,549
- They're waiting for me. - You're addicted.

1453
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:35,249
They're waiting for me.

1454
00:51:35,879 --> 00:51:36,879
I have to get online fast.

1455
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,109
They're waiting for me.

1456
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:41,749
(They are so cute.)

1457
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:44,809
(Good job, Seok Jin!)

1458
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:47,649
(He's so funny!)

1459
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:50,449
(I want to put him in my pocket.)

1460
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:52,249
(SBS station in Tanhyeon)

1461
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:53,449
We will probably be using our phones again.

1462
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:54,949
- What will be the punishment? - What's this?

1463
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:58,109
- This is the last mission. - Yes.

1464
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,749
This is going to be an individual race.

1465
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,009
It's Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game.

1466
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,349
(Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game?)

1467
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,349
(They've played it numerous times.)

1468
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:13,449
(They are professionals.)

1469
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:15,809
(But today's game is different.)

1470
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:18,649
(It's going to be SNS Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game.)

1471
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:22,549
(It starts right now.)

1472
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:24,649
(Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game?)

1473
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:26,149
What's that?

1474
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:27,249
This is crazy.

1475
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:28,649
So the followers must pick the target.

1476
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:29,909
On your SNS,

1477
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:32,749
you will ask which person's name tag you should rip.

1478
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,849
You can rip the name tag of the first person that comes up.

1479
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:37,349
It will be me.

1480
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:40,449
(He might be the public enemy.)

1481
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:42,149
That's not true.

1482
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:43,349
(I know how it's going to be.)

1483
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:44,749
- It's luck. - Yes.

1484
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:46,549
The last one standing will...

1485
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,949
will receive 10 Running Balls.

1486
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:49,249
(The final survivor will receive 10 Running Balls.)

1487
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:50,779
The second to last survivor will receive six.

1488
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:53,779
The next one five, and so on.

1489
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:55,079
The first one to be eliminated will receive only one.

1490
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,179
They get one at least?

1491
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:57,349
Yes.

1492
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:58,979
There is a new rule.

1493
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,579
Five Running Balls...

1494
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:03,479
can be exchanged with one name tag.

1495
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:05,149
(Five Running Balls can be exchanged with one name tag.)

1496
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:06,179
My goodness!

1497
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,079
Can we exchange them whenever? Or do we have to do it now?

1498
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:14,179
- Now? - You can exchange them only once...

1499
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:15,979
before we start.

1500
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,179
- It's worth investing in. - So that's it.

1501
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:21,349
So everything depends on the commenters.

1502
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,379
They'll decide whose name tag we should go for.

1503
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:28,449
(Their target will be selected by the comments.)

1504
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,979
I'm in trouble.

1505
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,979
What should I do?

1506
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:36,679
I don't have that many Running Balls.

1507
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,949
Since the commenters must be fans of Running Man,

1508
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:48,049
there's a good chance that they'll choose me as the target.

1509
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:50,179
My goal is to be included in the last four to survive...

1510
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:53,249
and have more than 10 Running Balls.

1511
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:55,579
That's my goal.

1512
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:58,979
Today,

1513
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:00,479
I don't expect to be the winner.

1514
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,579
I just want to avoid the punishment.

1515
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,079
(They just want to avoid the punishment.)

1516
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,679
Who will be my target?

1517
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,279
I'm sure a lot of them will choose me as the target.

1518
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:14,479
I'll be a better person in 2016.

1519
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:16,649
I didn't know we would play a game like this.

1520
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:19,249
I know I've been bad.

1521
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:20,309
I apologise.

1522
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:22,879
Please give me a chance.

1523
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:24,479
I'm so afraid.

1524
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:26,679
They'll definitely aim at me. I'm the race starter.

1525
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:28,549
They'll definitely choose me.

1526
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:30,779
I'm sure I'll be the target of at least one of the six.

1527
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:32,579
- Now. - Yes.

1528
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,409
Post, "Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game."

1529
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:36,249
"Whose name tag should I rip?"

1530
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:38,409
What if I get Jong Kook?

1531
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,309
Can't I add more details?

1532
00:54:40,379 --> 00:54:41,379
No, you can't.

1533
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:42,879
Everyone should write the same thing.

1534
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,579
"Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game."

1535
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:46,349
"Whose name tag should I rip?"

1536
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,579
(Sighing)

1537
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,449
I should look determined.

1538
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:55,779
(Determined)

1539
00:54:57,779 --> 00:55:01,409
(He can't stop sighing.)

1540
00:55:01,479 --> 00:55:03,249
Please don't say Jong Kook.

1541
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:05,979
Please.

1542
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:08,979
(Smiling)

1543
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,879
(Looking innocent)

1544
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:13,079
I tried to look weak.

1545
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:15,379
(Will his strategy work?)

1546
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,679
(Posing for the photo)

1547
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:20,079
(Focusing on her selfie)

1548
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,179
What are you doing?

1549
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:24,449
Please understand me. Selfies are important to girls.

1550
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:26,079
I'm so bad at it.

1551
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:33,579
(Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game. Whose name tag should I rip?)

1552
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,349
(Whoever the commenter picks will be my target.)

1553
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:38,679
Whose name tag should I rip?

1554
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:44,049
(He even bends his knees.)

1555
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,349
Please be nice.

1556
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:46,879
I'll upload it.

1557
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:47,979
(I'll upload it.)

1558
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:51,249
Do you think it'll work?

1559
00:55:51,979 --> 00:55:53,579
(Please have mercy on me.)

1560
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:00,979
(It's time to check who their target is.)

1561
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,049
I'm worried.

1562
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,509
(Time to read the comment)

1563
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:05,879
(Who will be Jae Seok's target?)

1564
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:07,179
Please.

1565
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,979
(Goodness)

1566
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:13,379
(Jae Seok's target is Haha.)

1567
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:16,679
Haha is no easy target.

1568
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,149
Oh, I got it.

1569
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,079
It's Gary.

1570
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:26,449
Why does it have to be him? This is crazy.

1571
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:29,179
Why does it have to be him?

1572
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:30,779
(It's Haha's rival, Gary!)

1573
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:32,279
It's motivating me.

1574
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:33,779
(It's Haha's rival, Gary!)

1575
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,579
I got it.

1576
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:38,179
- Who did you get? - Seok Jin.

1577
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:39,779
(Gary's target is Seok Jin.)

1578
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:42,579
Jong Kook is right under.

1579
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:44,579
Really?

1580
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:46,079
(Gary barely avoided Jong Kook.)

1581
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:49,409
It could've been so much worse.

1582
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:53,179
Oh, I got Gary.

1583
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:54,379
It's Gary.

1584
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,979
What should I do?

1585
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:02,549
(Ji Hyo's target is the betrayer, Kwang Soo.)

1586
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:03,679
It's Kwang Soo.

1587
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,449
(Ji Hyo's target is Kwang Soo.)

1588
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:10,679
Let's see.

1589
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,479
(Who will be...)

1590
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:15,409
(Jong Kook's target?)

1591
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:16,479
It's Kwang Soo.

1592
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:21,679
I'm sure Kwang Soo's target is me.

1593
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:24,249
(Will his target really be Jong Kook?)

1594
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:26,179
Please. I'm desperate.

1595
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:30,679
I only have three Running Balls. I have nowhere to turn.

1596
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:32,679
Oh.

1597
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:33,979
It's Haha.

1598
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:37,409
What should I do?

1599
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:40,949
(Who will win the Targeted Name Tag Ripping Game?)

1600
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:46,879
(Targets summary)

1601
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:51,509
I should watch out for Jong Kook.

1602
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,349
Jong Kook's target is likely to be Kwang Soo.

1603
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:56,649
(I'm rooting for you, Jae Seok!)

1604
00:57:57,379 --> 00:57:59,379
Where's Kwang Soo?

1605
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:02,449
(I'm sure Jong Kook will win.)

1606
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:04,479
(Don't rip Jae Seok's name tag.)

1607
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:06,649
(Jong Kook is on his way!)

1608
00:58:08,249 --> 00:58:10,779
Jong Kook, Seok Jin, Haha.

1609
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,479
Jong Kook, Haha.

1610
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:15,879
Where's Kwang Soo?

1611
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,049
Where is he?

1612
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:23,309
(Jong Kook is getting close.)

1613
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:24,779
Turn off the light.

1614
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:27,579
He must be there.

1615
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:29,779
He should be there.

1616
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,309
(Nervous)

1617
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:34,579
He's looking for someone.

1618
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,479
He's searching everywhere for someone.

1619
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:39,979
(Kwang Soo, he's looking for you.)

1620
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,279
I'm scared of him.

1621
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:44,079
How could I rip Gary's name tag?

1622
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:45,879
Gary is, in my opinion,

1623
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:50,509
the second or third best one among us.

1624
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,049
He's the second or third most popular one.

1625
00:58:53,249 --> 00:58:54,449
- Gary. - Yes.

1626
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:56,379
- Who did you get? - What about you?

1627
00:58:57,279 --> 00:58:58,679
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo?

1628
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:01,249
I got Seok Jin.

1629
00:59:01,949 --> 00:59:04,079
I'm telling the truth. I can even turn my back on you.

1630
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,549
I had a feeling that your target could be me.

1631
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,579
Your name came up, but Kwang Soo's was first.

1632
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:13,779
I think Jong Kook got either me or Kwang Soo.

1633
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:16,449
I actually don't think his target is me.

1634
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,409
Because they probably thought I was no match for him.

1635
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,179
Ji Hyo might have advantage in this game.

1636
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:22,579
No one chose Ji Hyo as my target.

1637
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:23,979
- No one would choose her. - I couldn't see her name.

1638
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,179
- You go first. - It's a bit narrow here.

1639
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:28,549
(They won't show their back to the other.)

1640
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:30,079
You go first.

1641
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:31,179
Fine.

1642
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,579
(Extremely careful)

1643
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:34,879
This is crazy.

1644
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:36,649
We should watch our back.

1645
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,449
We should watch out for Kwang Soo.

1646
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:41,679
- We should watch out for him. - Oh, it's Ji Hyo.

1647
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:43,979
Who did you get?

1648
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,079
Oh, my gosh.

1649
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:49,679
I got Seok Jin.

1650
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:52,579
(My target, Seok Jin,)

1651
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:54,779
(is right there.)

1652
00:59:54,879 --> 00:59:57,679
(Oh, it's Gary.)

1653
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:01,879
How could I rip Gary's name tag?

1654
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:03,949
(There you are.)

1655
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,449
Who did you get?

1656
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:07,509
- Did you get... - Did you, by any chance...

1657
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:08,779
Is it us or not?

1658
01:00:08,879 --> 01:00:11,079
- It's not you, I mean it. - My target is Kwang Soo.

1659
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,249
- Kwang Soo? - What about you?

1660
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:13,509
I got the same.

1661
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,509
- We both got Kwang Soo. - Really?

1662
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,679
- Seriously? - Yes.

1663
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,879
Then none of us are aiming at any of us?

1664
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:19,379
- No. - Then...

1665
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,079
- I mean it. - We should help each other.

1666
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:22,979
When there's Jong Kook around, we should help each other.

1667
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,309
- Let's team up. - Let's do this.

1668
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:25,409
So we're safe here.

1669
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:27,579
- Trust us. - Okay, I got it.

1670
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:29,179
Kwang Soo.

1671
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:31,779
Hey.

1672
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,079
(Jong Kook finally found Kwang Soo.)

1673
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:35,279
Tell me who your target is.

1674
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:36,879
Who's your target?

1675
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:38,679
- Is it me? - No.

1676
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:40,379
- Be honest. - I mean it.

1677
01:00:40,449 --> 01:00:42,179
- I can even show you. - Tell me the truth. In 3, 2, 1.

1678
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:44,079
- It's Haha. I can show you. - You're being suspicious.

1679
01:00:44,149 --> 01:00:46,379
- I mean it. - Tell me the truth. Show me.

1680
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:48,679
(Nobody trusts me any more.)

1681
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,549
Give it to me.

1682
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:52,679
- Is this it? - Yes.

1683
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:53,779
Your target is not me, is it?

1684
01:00:53,879 --> 01:00:56,379
(Your target is not me, is it?)

1685
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:59,049
(My target?)

1686
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:01,879
(Do you want to know?)

1687
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:02,979
I got Kwang Soo.

1688
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:05,079
(It's you.)

1689
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,579
Kwang Soo's target must be me.

1690
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:09,779
(My answer is...)

1691
01:01:09,879 --> 01:01:11,349
Of course it's not you.

1692
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:13,979
My target is Jae Seok. I mean it.

1693
01:01:14,779 --> 01:01:16,079
(Doubting)

1694
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,079
So many chose me as your target.

1695
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,679
And you're telling me your target is not me?

1696
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,679
You're spending so much time here.

1697
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:26,879
I couldn't possibly be your target.

1698
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,879
Of course not. Why would I be doing this otherwise?

1699
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,779
I was thinking that if your target is not me,

1700
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:32,879
we should cooperate.

1701
01:01:32,949 --> 01:01:34,079
- Sure. - Right?

1702
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:36,379
- Who's your target again? - It's Haha.

1703
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:38,449
(Answering without hesitation)

1704
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:39,509
You see?

1705
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,679
(Jong Kook is finished checking.)

1706
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,049
- Then what should we do? - Did you check every comment?

1707
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:44,149
Of course.

1708
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:45,779
You're unbelievable.

1709
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:48,679
(Jong Kook checked thousands of comments.)

1710
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:49,779
Let's do it like this.

1711
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:52,479
You rip Haha's name tag first.

1712
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,779
Is that an easy thing?

1713
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:56,449
Sure. And you help me with ripping Jae Seok's name tag.

1714
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:57,679
I got it.

1715
01:01:58,579 --> 01:01:59,779
Let's do that.

1716
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:01,579
You fully trust me, right?

1717
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,349
Put your hand on my name tag.

1718
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:04,779
Put your hand on my name tag.

1719
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,549
(What?)

1720
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:08,079
(I can put my hand on your name tag?)

1721
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:09,979
(How lucky am I.)

1722
01:02:10,049 --> 01:02:11,049
Okay.

1723
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:15,449
(Jong Kook, we're now allied, right?)

1724
01:02:15,509 --> 01:02:16,649
(Ripping)

1725
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,949
(He ripped it off!)

1726
01:02:18,979 --> 01:02:19,979
(He ripped the name tag.)

1727
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:22,579
Lee Kwang Soo is eliminated.

1728
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:24,879
Lee Kwang Soo is eliminated.

1729
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:26,179
(What just happened?)

1730
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:27,309
My target was you.

1731
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:28,949
(A slap in the face)

1732
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:30,949
(He got me.)

1733
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:34,079
My target was you. I didn't want to struggle.

1734
01:02:34,479 --> 01:02:35,679
That's why I did this.

1735
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:37,179
(Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.)

1736
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:38,409
(What should I do with you?)

1737
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:40,249
- Kwang Soo. - How can you do this?

1738
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,579
You're not worth my time.

1739
01:02:44,779 --> 01:02:45,979
Kwang Soo,

1740
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:48,209
- I really tried. - Okay.

1741
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:50,209
Please, understand.

1742
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,509
- I had no choice. - I...

1743
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:57,609
I'll get the punishment today.

1744
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:02,609
(Kwang Soo is the first one out.)

1745
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:06,779
(Jong Kook sets a new target.)

1746
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,709
(Who would be the next target?)

1747
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:11,509
Kwang Soo is gone. Gary?

1748
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:14,309
(His next target is Gary.)

1749
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:16,609
I think Gary will be...

1750
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,309
(Jong Kook is after Gary now.)

1751
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:21,309
- Let's get one person. - I think...

1752
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,309
- We have to get one. - There's no end.

1753
01:03:23,409 --> 01:03:26,709
- There's no end to this. - If we go on like this...

1754
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:28,309
- There's no end. - He's right.

1755
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,909
(We can't keep dragging the game like this.)

1756
01:03:32,979 --> 01:03:36,879
(My target, Haha is...)

1757
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:40,009
(right in front of my eyes.)

1758
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:43,579
(This is the perfect chance!)

1759
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:45,609
(He makes a move.)

1760
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:48,579
(What?)

1761
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:49,849
(He rips the name tag.)

1762
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:53,109
(A sudden attack)

1763
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:54,709
Was it Haha?

1764
01:03:56,109 --> 01:03:57,309
Was it Haha?

1765
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,109
(I'm sorry.)

1766
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:02,849
It was Haha?

1767
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,009
(Haha lost his words.)

1768
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,609
- Look at that! - It was Haha.

1769
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,209
- I knew it. - Sorry.

1770
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,609
- I knew this would happen. - You can't trust anyone.

1771
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:13,949
- They're all enemies. - Hey.

1772
01:04:14,009 --> 01:04:15,209
- It was Haha. - Thanks.

1773
01:04:15,209 --> 01:04:16,309
I'm sorry, Haha.

1774
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:22,109
A lot of people wanted you as my target.

1775
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:23,879
(That was scary.)

1776
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:25,209
I'm glad it wasn't me.

1777
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:26,679
(That was scary.)

1778
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,009
I can't trust anyone now.

1779
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:34,309
(The second person out is Haha.)

1780
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:37,879
What a perfect timing.

1781
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:40,479
(Jae Seok gets one Running Ball.)

1782
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,609
(He has to set the next target.)

1783
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,109
I feel sorry for Haha.

1784
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,679
(He feels sorry for Haha...)

1785
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,949
(but soon takes a selfie.)

1786
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,779
(He smiles.)

1787
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:54,509
I'll put Seok Jin's name.

1788
01:04:55,209 --> 01:04:56,209
Seok Jin.

1789
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,409
I don't want Jong Kook.

1790
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:03,379
(Oh, no!)

1791
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:04,779
(It's really Seok Jin.)

1792
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:07,849
Thank goodness. The next comment said Jong Kook.

1793
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:12,949
(He almost got Jong Kook.)

1794
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,209
That was close.

1795
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,809
That's why I put down Seok Jin first.

1796
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,809
(Jae Seok's next target is Seok Jin.)

1797
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:20,679
We have the sixth and seventh places, right?

1798
01:05:21,509 --> 01:05:24,209
- Seok Jin. - I don't trust you.

1799
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:25,679
- Seok Jin. - I'll trust Gary.

1800
01:05:25,749 --> 01:05:27,479
- I'd rather trust Gary. - Is Gary your target?

1801
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:28,579
Is Gary really your target?

1802
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:29,749
(Is Gary really your target?)

1803
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:31,309
- Go get him quickly. - Will you catch him?

1804
01:05:31,379 --> 01:05:32,579
- Okay. - Please.

1805
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:34,949
- You want to join me? - Gary can't know about this.

1806
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,109
It has to be Gary.

1807
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:40,979
- Really? - You can't catch him alone.

1808
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,209
I'd rather go for Gary than you.

1809
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,409
I don't trust him.

1810
01:05:47,379 --> 01:05:48,809
I can't trust anyone.

1811
01:05:49,409 --> 01:05:51,909
Because Jong Kook got Kwang Soo,

1812
01:05:51,979 --> 01:05:55,209
his next target could be me.

1813
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:57,409
You're lying.

1814
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:59,479
I saw what you did to Haha.

1815
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:00,509
(Look who's lying.)

1816
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:03,609
(Gary showed his back.)

1817
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,809
(Will Seok Jin get Gary's name tag?)

1818
01:06:07,879 --> 01:06:09,709
(No!)

1819
01:06:09,779 --> 01:06:10,979
What are you doing?

1820
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,109
(They fail to catch Gary.)

1821
01:06:12,379 --> 01:06:14,209
- You're both after me? - No.

1822
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,609
(It's too late for Gary.)

1823
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,509
Gary. Gary.

1824
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,509
(Oh, no!)

1825
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:25,609
(Gary fails to grab Seok Jin's name tag.)

1826
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:26,849
- Gary. - Gary.

1827
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:28,609
- Hey. - Hey.

1828
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:29,709
(He rips it.)

1829
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:33,209
(Seok Jin rips Gary's name tag.)

1830
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:34,979
- No! - I'm sorry.

1831
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:36,079
Gary.

1832
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:38,209
- I should have ripped his. - Gary.

1833
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:40,209
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

1834
01:06:40,509 --> 01:06:42,679
Kwang Soo. I'm sorry, Gary.

1835
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:44,849
What are you?

1836
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,109
(Kwang Soo the Grim Reaper)

1837
01:06:47,479 --> 01:06:49,709
- Sorry, Gary. - I knew it.

1838
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:52,479
I'm sorry. Please understand.

1839
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,709
(Seok Jin sets a new target.)

1840
01:07:00,009 --> 01:07:01,009
It's Ji Hyo.

1841
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:03,109
First comment says Ji Hyo.

1842
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:07,509
(Seok Jin's next target is Ji Hyo.)

1843
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:10,879
Gary is eliminated. Gary is eliminated.

1844
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:12,109
I need to change my target.

1845
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:14,009
(Gary was Jong Kook's next target.)

1846
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,079
Who will it be?

1847
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:18,409
People are getting their name tags ripped off fast.

1848
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,609
I didn't expect that.

1849
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:22,109
I didn't expect that to happen.

1850
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:27,109
(Only Jae Seok, Ji Hyo and Seok Jin are left.)

1851
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,109
Oh my goodness.

1852
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:31,779
(Ji Hyo is his next target.)

1853
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:34,409
It's Ji Hyo. What will do I?

1854
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:36,849
It's Ji Hyo.

1855
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:38,709
(Why does it have to be Ji Hyo?)

1856
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:41,009
Ji Hyo is the hardest target.

1857
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:43,009
(Jong Kook is weak against pretty women.)

1858
01:07:44,709 --> 01:07:47,679
- Hey. - Think this through.

1859
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:48,849
Is Jong Kook your target?

1860
01:07:48,849 --> 01:07:50,009
(Is Jong Kook your target?)

1861
01:07:50,009 --> 01:07:51,509
I think your...

1862
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:52,949
next target is me.

1863
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:54,309
You have to think carefully.

1864
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:55,579
You have to think carefully.

1865
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:59,579
I don't care which side you choose. I stand neutral.

1866
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,849
- Who's your target? - Jong Kook.

1867
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:05,009
- You can't take him out alone. - You're right.

1868
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:07,409
- Help me. - That's right.

1869
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:10,109
- So help me. - To be honest,

1870
01:08:10,109 --> 01:08:13,009
- whoever it is... - Ji Hyo, think about it.

1871
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:16,119
- Think about what? - If you help me take Seok Jin out,

1872
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:17,749
- you can win the third place. - Right.

1873
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:19,749
- Yes. - It's better to get more people.

1874
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:20,879
- Your target is me. - It's not...

1875
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:23,619
- important. - Your target is me.

1876
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,379
(Seok Jin attacks first.)

1877
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,009
(They reach for the name tags at the same time.)

1878
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:30,309
(He rips it.)

1879
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,009
(Seok Jin is out.)

1880
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:35,849
I knew what you were trying to do.

1881
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:39,309
(Jae Seok gets another Running Ball.)

1882
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,379
Who is out? Is it Seok Jin?

1883
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:44,579
Did Jae Seok get him?

1884
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:46,809
Then I wasn't his target.

1885
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:53,009
It was my chance to get Ji Hyo.

1886
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:55,009
- You should've told me. - It's not...

1887
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:56,119
easy to get Jae Seok...

1888
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:58,309
- or Jong Kook. - No.

1889
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:01,619
(Jae Seok takes a victorious selfie.)

1890
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:05,309
(The only targets left are Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1891
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,479
I think it's up.

1892
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:11,509
It's Jong Kook.

1893
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:13,779
I was expecting it.

1894
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,749
I have to be ready for this.

1895
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:20,879
Let's go downstairs.

1896
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:22,409
Let's go.

1897
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,409
(Jong Kook hides first.)

1898
01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:27,009
- Jae Seok. - Listen.

1899
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:28,409
Listen carefully.

1900
01:09:29,309 --> 01:09:31,479
- Your target is Jong Kook, right? - Yes.

1901
01:09:31,509 --> 01:09:32,949
It doesn't matter if it's me.

1902
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:35,009
- My target is Jong Kook. - I've decided.

1903
01:09:35,849 --> 01:09:38,409
- You can't catch Jong Kook. - Right.

1904
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:40,509
It's hard for the both of us. So it'll have to be me.

1905
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:42,619
- You rip Jong Kook's tag. - Okay.

1906
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:43,749
- Got it? - Okay.

1907
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:45,579
If your target is me,

1908
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:47,479
take me out gently.

1909
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:49,009
You're really not my target.

1910
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:51,849
Ji Hyo, do it gently.

1911
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:54,009
- Okay? - You really aren't my target.

1912
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:55,119
(Jae Seok is ready to sacrifice himself.)

1913
01:09:55,209 --> 01:09:56,409
- Think carefully. - Really.

1914
01:09:56,509 --> 01:09:58,009
We should stick together.

1915
01:09:58,119 --> 01:09:59,879
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo are allies.)

1916
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:03,309
(On the other side...)

1917
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:04,409
I knew this would happen.

1918
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,119
Good thing I bought a name tag.

1919
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:08,809
(Good thing I bought a name tag.)

1920
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:10,809
(A name tag?)

1921
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,209
With every five Running Balls,

1922
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:16,779
you can buy a name tag.

1923
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,909
(Seok Jin looks happy.)

1924
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:22,909
I won't buy it.

1925
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:24,909
I won't buy it.

1926
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:26,879
I won't buy it.

1927
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,579
It's not about having another name tag.

1928
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:30,619
I like to invest.

1929
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:33,749
When an opportunity comes along,

1930
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:36,679
I invest. So I'll buy it.

1931
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,579
- I'll take one. - Here you go.

1932
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:40,809
(He buys a name tag with five Running Balls.)

1933
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:42,779
Put it on please.

1934
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:49,009
(Will he win the game...)

1935
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,979
(with this new name tag?)

1936
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:55,979
Do they know that I'm back in the game?

1937
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,379
Nobody knows? That's awesome.

1938
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:00,619
Jae Seok's target could be me.

1939
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:02,509
His new target is Jong Kook.

1940
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:04,509
He was assigned a new target.

1941
01:11:04,579 --> 01:11:05,809
(But...)

1942
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:07,809
(look who it is!)

1943
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:10,949
(Seok Jin is so unlucky.)

1944
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:13,009
- He bought a name tag. - What?

1945
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:14,119
He bought a name tag.

1946
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,479
(They are shocked.)

1947
01:11:15,509 --> 01:11:17,209
He bought a name tag?

1948
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:20,309
(That was unexpected.)

1949
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:21,809
Who knew?

1950
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:23,509
What do we do?

1951
01:11:24,309 --> 01:11:27,119
If he's back in the game, I'm still his target.

1952
01:11:27,209 --> 01:11:29,309
(Ji Hyo is Seok Jin's target.)

1953
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:31,119
I wasn't expecting this.

1954
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:35,009
(I need a new strategy.)

1955
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,979
They saw me. Goodness.

1956
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:41,619
Hide. Don't go that way.

1957
01:11:43,309 --> 01:11:45,779
(Seok Jin came this way.)

1958
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:50,309
You're standing in a place like this.

1959
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:51,619
Are you after Ji Hyo again?

1960
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:54,379
- Wait. - There's something I want to say.

1961
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:55,909
Let's get Jong Kook first.

1962
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,309
- Okay. - You're nobody's target.

1963
01:11:58,309 --> 01:12:00,119
So you have to grab Jong Kook.

1964
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:01,409
Okay, I'll help you.

1965
01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:03,209
I know what you're saying.

1966
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:04,619
Ji Hyo, trust me.

1967
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:08,119
I'll come with you.

1968
01:12:08,849 --> 01:12:10,909
Okay. You're not my target anyway.

1969
01:12:10,979 --> 01:12:13,209
- Right. - You're not my target either.

1970
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:16,079
(I was listening to you talk.)

1971
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:17,379
They're together over there.

1972
01:12:18,009 --> 01:12:20,119
(If they are all after me,)

1973
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:23,809
(I should hide.)

1974
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:26,079
How will we get him?

1975
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:28,619
He might pop up all of a sudden.

1976
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:29,709
He's difficult to get.

1977
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:33,119
(Where is Jong Kook hiding?)

1978
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:36,119
Let's look at the security cameras.

1979
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:38,119
- There he is. - Where?

1980
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,849
- Can we take a look? - Sure.

1981
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:42,379
He's right here.

1982
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:43,509
Excuse us.

1983
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:45,619
What floor is this?

1984
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:47,479
The third floor? Okay. Thank you.

1985
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:50,309
- Did you see him? - I saw him on a security camera.

1986
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:51,809
(They go to the third floor.)

1987
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:53,619
(They are nervous.)

1988
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:55,809
I will lead. Okay?

1989
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:01,309
(It's Jong Kook!)

1990
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:04,809
(Seok Jin bravely runs towards Jong Kook.)

1991
01:13:04,909 --> 01:13:07,619
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo follow him.)

1992
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:08,909
(Jong Kook is attacked.)

1993
01:13:08,979 --> 01:13:10,909
(You surprised me!)

1994
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:13,379
(Jong Kook attacks Ji Hyo, his target.)

1995
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:14,619
Ji Hyo.

1996
01:13:16,409 --> 01:13:19,619
(Protect Ji Hyo!)

1997
01:13:21,809 --> 01:13:23,809
(Just as they planned, Jae Seok and Seok Jin grab Jong Kook.)

1998
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:25,279
(Ji Hyo needs to rip his name tag off now.)

1999
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:27,009
Rip his name tag.

2000
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:28,379
(Now Ji Hyo can rip his name tag.)

2001
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:30,279
(They all fall.)

2002
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:33,709
(Jong Kook grabs Ji Hyo.)

2003
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,709
(Will Ji Hyo be out like this?)

2004
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:39,119
(Jae Seok rips Jong Kook's name tag!)

2005
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:40,409
I ripped it first.

2006
01:13:41,179 --> 01:13:44,079
(Jong Kook's name tag is removed.)

2007
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:45,549
You had Jong Kook.

2008
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,379
(Exhausted)

2009
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:48,709
Darn it.

2010
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:50,909
- We got him. - He's so strong.

2011
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,209
- Are you all right? - I am okay.

2012
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:53,309
Are you okay?

2013
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:54,709
That was crazy.

2014
01:13:55,009 --> 01:13:57,279
- It took three of us. - I almost got him.

2015
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,409
Gosh.

2016
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,309
He was like a tiger.

2017
01:14:00,509 --> 01:14:01,979
I couldn't do it because it was Ji Hyo.

2018
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:03,119
I would've fought back if it was a guy.

2019
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,009
He couldn't fight because his target was a woman.

2020
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:06,549
Don't forget my sacrifice.

2021
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,009
I won't forget it.

2022
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:09,479
- You know it, right? - I know it well.

2023
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:12,909
(Next time, let's fight man-to-man.)

2024
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:14,379
Kim Jong Kook is eliminated.

2025
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:16,709
(Jae Seok has to get a new target.)

2026
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:18,009
In the end,

2027
01:14:18,909 --> 01:14:19,909
I have to win.

2028
01:14:23,509 --> 01:14:25,479
(He makes a pitiful face and takes a selfie.)

2029
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:30,009
(Between Ji Hyo and Seok Jin, who should I get?)

2030
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,979
(I'm really tired.)

2031
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:35,409
There you go.

2032
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:39,809
(Jae Seok's next target is Ji Hyo.)

2033
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,619
(Between Seok Jin and Jae Seok, who should I get?)

2034
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:44,119
(Ji Hyo gets another target.)

2035
01:14:50,349 --> 01:14:53,379
(Ji Hyo's next target is Seok Jin.)

2036
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:55,119
(Now Jae Seok, Seok Jin and Ji Hyo remain.)

2037
01:14:55,179 --> 01:14:57,619
You really fought hard. Really.

2038
01:14:58,379 --> 01:14:59,549
Who's your target?

2039
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:01,009
- Is it me? - No.

2040
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:03,619
- I feel bad. - Why?

2041
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:06,209
Seok Jin helped me, and now he's my target.

2042
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:10,709
I feel so sorry.

2043
01:15:11,009 --> 01:15:12,409
What do we do?

2044
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:13,909
(He's worried.)

2045
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,479
- Your target is Seok Jin too? - Yes.

2046
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:17,709
You're lying.

2047
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,209
(You can't fool me.)

2048
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,619
I am sorry.

2049
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:22,909
(It's you.)

2050
01:15:23,009 --> 01:15:26,619
(What do we do?)

2051
01:15:27,579 --> 01:15:29,179
I am sorry.

2052
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:30,809
It was for...

2053
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:32,009
a short while,

2054
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:33,309
but we became really close...

2055
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:36,119
while trying to catch the tiger.

2056
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,179
(At that time,)

2057
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:43,709
(Seok Jin attacks.)

2058
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:45,009
Oh gosh!

2059
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,309
I have no other way to go.

2060
01:15:47,379 --> 01:15:49,409
Hold on. Ji Hyo.

2061
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,009
I have no other way to go.

2062
01:15:51,809 --> 01:15:52,979
- Hey! - Jae Seok!

2063
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:54,279
(Ripping)

2064
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:55,709
(Jae Seok successfully rips Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2065
01:15:55,809 --> 01:15:57,009
I am sorry, Ji Hyo.

2066
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,349
(Jae Seok earns one more Running Ball.)

2067
01:15:58,409 --> 01:15:59,709
Ji Hyo.

2068
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:01,279
What did I do?

2069
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:03,279
I am sorry, Ji Hyo.

2070
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:07,309
I can't believe it's down to two of us. Let's end it.

2071
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,309
I never knew I would face you like this.

2072
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:11,349
Now that I got this far,

2073
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:13,309
- I really want to win. - I know you do.

2074
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:15,009
I think it would be nice...

2075
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:16,449
to begin the new year...

2076
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,309
as the winner.

2077
01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:19,909
Let's grab each other's arm.

2078
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,009
(They grab each other.)

2079
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:24,009
Gosh!

2080
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:25,279
(They rotate.)

2081
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:26,709
(They are standing even!)

2082
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:27,709
I...

2083
01:16:27,809 --> 01:16:29,209
- Let go. - I want this.

2084
01:16:29,809 --> 01:16:31,209
I want this.

2085
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,709
I want this.

2086
01:16:33,809 --> 01:16:35,409
(If he wins, he will get10 Running Balls.)

2087
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:36,909
- Wait. - I heard a crack.

2088
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:40,009
It's all right. Come on.

2089
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,349
(Jae Seok grabs Seok Jin's name tag.)

2090
01:16:42,409 --> 01:16:43,909
(And Seok Jin grabs it simultaneously.)

2091
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:47,709
(Ripping)

2092
01:16:47,809 --> 01:16:50,479
(Jae Seok rips Seok Jin's name tag first.)

2093
01:16:50,549 --> 01:16:51,709
Darn it!

2094
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:56,209
- No! - I did it.

2095
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,579
This is crazy.

2096
01:16:58,619 --> 01:16:59,809
I won.

2097
01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:00,909
(Jae Seok earns 10 extra Running Balls.)

2098
01:17:02,509 --> 01:17:03,619
(Jae Seok ends up with 18 Running Balls.)

2099
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,009
What? No way.

2100
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:06,709
What?

2101
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:08,209
How can this be?

2102
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:10,619
- We are supposed to choose one? - It's been five years.

2103
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,709
What's this?

2104
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:13,009
What is it?

2105
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:14,579
- We have to wear it. - It's the punishment?

2106
01:17:14,619 --> 01:17:16,009
- It's intense. - I will tell you the punishment.

2107
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:17,909
- How can we... - It's a costume?

2108
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:20,119
- It's a costume? - It's Gary's!

2109
01:17:20,809 --> 01:17:22,279
We are supposed to go somewhere in these?

2110
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:23,809
This is the punishment.

2111
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:25,579
- One person... - This is better.

2112
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:27,809
who doesn't get anything...

2113
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:30,809
will walk to the nearest subway station.

2114
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,619
- No! - That's too much.

2115
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:34,619
One person?

2116
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:36,309
These are okay to wear.

2117
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:37,809
This one is the problem.

2118
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,709
- How can someone wear this? - How can we...

2119
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:43,509
Your manager will be waiting for you at the station.

2120
01:17:43,809 --> 01:17:45,809
You can walk there and take the car back here.

2121
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,209
- Not in a million years. - No way.

2122
01:17:47,309 --> 01:17:48,619
- So one person... - Gosh.

2123
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:49,909
- is going to be safe. - It's lighter than toilet paper.

2124
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:55,279
(The Running Ball draw will determine who will wear what.)

2125
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:57,509
Here we go.

2126
01:17:58,179 --> 01:17:59,279
Please!

2127
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:01,119
It's been such a long time.

2128
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:05,679
(Their Running Balls are inside the machine.)

2129
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:07,479
I beg you. Please!

2130
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:10,379
- Please! - Please!

2131
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,309
Please. Please...

2132
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:15,209
The first winner is...

2133
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:16,549
The first winner is...

2134
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:18,079
Please.

2135
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:19,579
I would be so happy.

2136
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:21,079
(The ball came out.)

2137
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,619
- I would be so happy. - Is it out?

2138
01:18:22,809 --> 01:18:24,509
- Is it out? - Is it out?

2139
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:25,709
- It's out. - It's out? Who is it?

2140
01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:27,209
- The first winner is... - Please!

2141
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:28,909
- Please. - Just this once.

2142
01:18:29,379 --> 01:18:32,119
- Please. - Just this once.

2143
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,209
- It's me. - Who is it?

2144
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:39,619
(Who will be the first one to avoid the punishment?)

2145
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:41,409
(Jae Seok is the first winner.)

2146
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:42,579
Jae Seok!

2147
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:43,849
(It's Jae Seok.)

2148
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:47,309
The start of this year is good.

2149
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:50,349
It's because you got rid of all the bad luck.

2150
01:18:50,619 --> 01:18:52,209
That's the power of having 18 Running Balls.

2151
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:53,619
That punishment I got last year...

2152
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:55,479
was really worth it.

2153
01:18:55,549 --> 01:18:56,619
(He's benefitting from last week's.)

2154
01:18:56,619 --> 01:18:58,549
I've never been lucky like this before.

2155
01:18:58,809 --> 01:19:00,809
- First time in six years. - It's the first time!

2156
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:02,479
- Don't look. - I won't.

2157
01:19:02,549 --> 01:19:04,079
- I will just face the front. - Please.

2158
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,309
This is the second winner.

2159
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:07,809
- Please. - I've never been so desperate.

2160
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,449
- I've never been so nervous. - Is the ball out?

2161
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,549
Please.

2162
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:11,809
- Is the ball out? - Did it come out?

2163
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:14,209
- It's out. - It's supposed to be a lucky year.

2164
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:15,379
I'm supposed to be lucky this year.

2165
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:17,009
Who's the second winner?

2166
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:18,119
He doesn't look happy.

2167
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:19,209
This is a miracle. It's Haha.

2168
01:19:19,309 --> 01:19:20,579
(It's Haha.)

2169
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:25,119
(Haha, who only had six balls, won.)

2170
01:19:25,809 --> 01:19:28,449
(No way.)

2171
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:31,619
(This is a miracle.)

2172
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:34,809
(They get more nervous.)

2173
01:19:34,909 --> 01:19:36,809
- This is crazy. - I will donate it!

2174
01:19:36,909 --> 01:19:38,179
(He doesn't know what he's talking about.)

2175
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:39,809
(He shouts loudly.)

2176
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,009
Thank you!

2177
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:43,009
Thank you!

2178
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:44,979
We will choose the next winner. Please face the front.

2179
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:46,579
- I will... - This doesn't make sense.

2180
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:48,119
- I will keep this forever. - Come here.

2181
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:49,709
Leave Haha and come here.

2182
01:19:50,409 --> 01:19:51,709
Please!

2183
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:53,279
- Please! - The third winner is...

2184
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:54,909
I can't wear this.

2185
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:57,619
Don't worry, Jong Kook.

2186
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,379
It doesn't make sense.

2187
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:01,449
It's all mixed.

2188
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:02,619
There's 95 percent chance.

2189
01:20:03,009 --> 01:20:04,119
Thank you so much.

2190
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:06,379
- Thank you so much. - It's Ji Hyo.

2191
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:09,619
(Ji Hyo is the third winner.)

2192
01:20:09,709 --> 01:20:12,009
(She's always lucky.)

2193
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:13,179
Really? Wow!

2194
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:15,449
I thought I was going to wear that.

2195
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:16,579
Scream!

2196
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,209
Scream!

2197
01:20:18,309 --> 01:20:19,409
It's not me!

2198
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,619
- Scream! - It's okay as long as it's not me!

2199
01:20:22,009 --> 01:20:23,279
It's okay as long as it's not me!

2200
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:24,909
It's okay as long as it's not me!

2201
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:26,349
I will pick the fourth one.

2202
01:20:26,979 --> 01:20:28,479
It's going to be me this time.

2203
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:29,579
It has to be me this time.

2204
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:31,449
(Who will be the fourth winner?)

2205
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:32,619
This is crazy.

2206
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:34,979
We have the ball.

2207
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:36,709
- It's out? - It's out.

2208
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:39,709
Don't say it's Kwang Soo.

2209
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:41,909
It's Seok Jin.

2210
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:45,349
(Seok Jin is the fourth winner.)

2211
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,119
I get to keep my pride at least.

2212
01:20:48,209 --> 01:20:49,279
(Bye, costumes!)

2213
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:53,979
(Now Jong Kook, Kwang Soo and Gary remain.)

2214
01:20:54,009 --> 01:20:55,009
Now,

2215
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,379
- when there's only one... - In the past,

2216
01:20:56,449 --> 01:20:58,119
I wore them with confidence.

2217
01:20:58,179 --> 01:20:59,579
Two singers and...

2218
01:20:59,909 --> 01:21:01,309
- and one actor remain. - Why do I hate it so much now?

2219
01:21:01,909 --> 01:21:03,119
Two singers and one actor.

2220
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:04,379
All right.

2221
01:21:04,449 --> 01:21:06,309
(Who will be the fifth winner?)

2222
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:08,079
Please come this way.

2223
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:09,179
- Is it out? - Yes.

2224
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:10,709
Is there a special reason...

2225
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:12,709
why you shouldn't wear one of these costumes?

2226
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:14,809
Honestly, there's no particular reason.

2227
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:17,279
- How about you, Jong Kook? - Why do I not want to wear it?

2228
01:21:17,349 --> 01:21:19,449
It's because I'd rather look hideous than funny.

2229
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:21,619
- How about you? - I think it's going to be...

2230
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,809
funnier if one of these two wears it.

2231
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:26,209
- Today... - You are right, Gary!

2232
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,909
(Gary is the fifth winner!)

2233
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:34,079
(He's saved at last.)

2234
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,619
(Now Jong Kook and Kwang Soo remain.)

2235
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:39,119
- It's my lucky year! - Hey,

2236
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:40,619
who are you to me?

2237
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:42,709
(Who are you to me?)

2238
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:47,509
(Last week,)

2239
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:53,179
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo were chosen as the best partners.)

2240
01:21:53,349 --> 01:21:56,349
(As if they are proving it,)

2241
01:21:56,409 --> 01:21:59,979
(they won the "X-Man" special together.)

2242
01:22:00,509 --> 01:22:03,309
(However,)

2243
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:06,079
(why are they like this now?)

2244
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:08,509
Please. Please. I am going to...

2245
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:10,409
- be a good man in 2016. - Seriously.

2246
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:11,809
If it's going to be really funny,

2247
01:22:11,909 --> 01:22:13,379
- Kwang Soo should do it. - It's out.

2248
01:22:13,449 --> 01:22:14,549
It's out.

2249
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:16,119
Now I don't even know the result.

2250
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:18,209
I didn't look at it yet. All right.

2251
01:22:19,209 --> 01:22:20,409
I didn't look at it yet.

2252
01:22:20,509 --> 01:22:22,179
- This new year... - Kwang Soo has a higher chance.

2253
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:23,449
That's not true.

2254
01:22:23,509 --> 01:22:25,009
- He has better luck. - On the episode of 2016.

2255
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:26,619
(Only one person will be saved.)

2256
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:27,909
Who will it be between them?

2257
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:30,279
In 1, 2, 3.

2258
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:34,279
(Who will be the last winner...)

2259
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:42,309
(to avoid the punishment?)

2260
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:02,389
Go.

2261
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:03,566
Kim Jong Kook.

2262
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:06,526
Kim Jong Kook.

2263
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,166
Kim Jong Kook.

2264
01:23:09,996 --> 01:23:13,966
(Kwang Soo is the one who will receive the punishment.)

2265
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,996
This is crazy.

2266
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:18,166
(While Jong Kook is happy,)

2267
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:19,426
(Kwang Soo is in despair.)

2268
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:21,466
I'm so happy.

2269
01:23:21,526 --> 01:23:23,366
Will this be decided by the first comment, too?

2270
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:25,136
Yes.

2271
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:29,051
It says, "The monkey costume".

2272
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,151
It's the monkey costume.

2273
01:23:31,251 --> 01:23:33,851
They were supposed to answer with a number.

2274
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:35,451
Why are they not doing as instructed?

2275
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,551
(Taking it out on the commenter)

2276
01:23:36,621 --> 01:23:37,621
What's the username?

2277
01:23:38,011 --> 01:23:39,711
- It's the monkey costume. - It's the year of the monkey.

2278
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:42,251
- That's right. - It's the year of the monkey.

2279
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:45,551
So you have to wear this costume...

2280
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:48,151
and walk from your home to the closest subway station.

2281
01:23:48,951 --> 01:23:50,251
Once again,

2282
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:52,151
today,

2283
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:54,451
for Running Man,

2284
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,811
so many people...

2285
01:23:56,881 --> 01:24:00,811
participated and cheered for us on SNS.

2286
01:24:01,051 --> 01:24:03,451
We appreciate it.

2287
01:24:03,781 --> 01:24:05,251
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

2288
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:06,351
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2289
01:24:06,451 --> 01:24:08,711
(Thank you for participating in Running Man.)

2290
01:24:08,781 --> 01:24:10,781
As I said earlier,

2291
01:24:10,851 --> 01:24:13,051
unlike the other members,

2292
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:15,951
Ji Hyo and I don't have our personal SNS pages.

2293
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:18,451
Our pages were on for just today.

2294
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:21,811
- I'd like to prevent any abuse. - It could happen.

2295
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:23,551
- So let us make it clear. - Okay.

2296
01:24:23,651 --> 01:24:28,051
Ji Hyo and I are never going to have SNS pages.

2297
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:30,811
The pages used for today...

2298
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:32,451
- will be... - Deactivated.

2299
01:24:32,551 --> 01:24:34,151
- deactivated. - Yes.

2300
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:38,951
Anyway, Kwang Soo will receive his punishment.

2301
01:24:39,151 --> 01:24:40,651
See you next week.

2302
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:45,251
Please be with us this year, too.

2303
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:47,911
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

2304
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,951
(Happy New Year, everyone!)

2305
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:54,451
What should I do?

2306
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:57,711
- My phone is off. - Three, two, one.

2307
01:24:58,011 --> 01:24:59,011
Come closer.

2308
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:02,781
(The next day)

2309
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:06,351
You're all insane.

2310
01:25:12,951 --> 01:25:16,351
(Kwang Soo is here.)

2311
01:25:20,751 --> 01:25:21,811
This is crazy.

2312
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:23,881
It's freezing.

2313
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:27,411
You have to walk to Geumho Station.

2314
01:25:28,981 --> 01:25:30,551
I'm going crazy.

2315
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:34,251
What am I doing? People are going to work.

2316
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:37,851
I can't do this.

2317
01:25:38,351 --> 01:25:41,151
I'm rarely this afraid.

2318
01:25:42,411 --> 01:25:45,551
(In the middle of a rush hour traffic jam,)

2319
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:50,251
(a bunch of monkeys showed up.)

2320
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:54,151
(Is that a human being or a monkey?)

2321
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:55,811
Oh, hello.

2322
01:25:57,911 --> 01:25:59,151
(It's for the show.)

2323
01:25:59,251 --> 01:26:00,951
(I'm a normal person.)

2324
01:26:01,011 --> 01:26:02,151
I didn't know the station was this far.

2325
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:04,851
Oh, I'm here.

2326
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:07,051
Hello.

2327
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:08,551
Good morning.

2328
01:26:09,351 --> 01:26:10,351
Happy New Year.

2329
01:26:11,011 --> 01:26:13,551
Because it's the year of the monkey,

2330
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:15,351
I'm wearing a monkey costume.

2331
01:26:15,811 --> 01:26:16,981
Do you want one?

2332
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:18,911
- I want one. - Sorry?

2333
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:20,511
- I want one. - Oh, sure.

2334
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:22,151
I want one, too.

2335
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,251
Oh, hello.

2336
01:26:24,911 --> 01:26:26,351
Oh, ma'am.

2337
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:29,051
Ma'am, you don't have to.

2338
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:30,851
(A lady puts her scarf around Kwang Soo.)

2339
01:26:30,911 --> 01:26:32,251
Thank you so much.

2340
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:33,751
Here you are.

2341
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:35,151
I want a pink one.

2342
01:26:35,251 --> 01:26:37,051
- A pink one? - I want a pink one, too.

2343
01:26:37,751 --> 01:26:39,811
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

2344
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:43,051
(The ladies left one by one.)

2345
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:45,711
What just happened?

2346
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:48,907
Why did I end up like this?

2347
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:52,651
Thank you.

2348
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:53,781
(He's wearing the scarf the lady gave him.)

2349
01:26:53,851 --> 01:26:55,251
This is so warm.

2350
01:26:57,651 --> 01:26:59,051
- Hi. - Hello.

2351
01:27:00,811 --> 01:27:02,151
I'm shaking.

2352
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,355
While I was shaking in the cold, you've been sitting in here.

2353
01:27:05,485 --> 01:27:06,785
I thought it was a sauna.

2354
01:27:07,785 --> 01:27:08,945
Thank you for coming to pick me up.

2355
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,585
Happy New Year.

2356
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:12,985
Happy New Year.

2357
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:15,355
Thank you. Happy New Year.

2358
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:16,985
(Kwang Soo completed his mission.)

2359
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:19,045
I'm freezing.

2360
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:21,645
I can buy anything.

2361
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:23,685
Send me 270 million dollars right now.

2362
01:27:25,485 --> 01:27:27,385
(A game secretly suggested to them)

2363
01:27:27,385 --> 01:27:29,015
The game of the heirs?

2364
01:27:30,549 --> 01:27:32,979
I'll be your hostess today. My name is Lim Ji Yeon.

2365
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:35,049
Are we playing hopscotch?

2366
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:36,949
I got it!

2367
01:27:37,009 --> 01:27:39,209
You should stay in Ji Hyo's land.

2368
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:40,549
What am I doing?

2369
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:42,649
Did you just step on my land?

2370
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:44,549
(Win the game to win the land.)

2371
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:45,749
It's driving me crazy.

2372
01:27:46,249 --> 01:27:47,609
What's that?

2373
01:27:48,449 --> 01:27:50,079
(The heirs bet everything on the games.)

2374
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:51,649
(Things are going out of control.)

2375
01:27:51,749 --> 01:27:52,749
(There's something special about this house.)

2376
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,709
I win!

2377
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:55,356
(Next week on Running Man, The Hopscotch)
