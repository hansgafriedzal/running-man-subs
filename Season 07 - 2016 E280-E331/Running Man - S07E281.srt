1
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,795
Running Village is renowned for its beautiful rivers and mountains.

2
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,495
There are seven affluent heirs in this village.

3
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:18,365
Haha, the heir to a fur merchant.

4
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:22,764
I enjoy jazz...

5
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,729
and coffee...

6
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:28,636
Jamaican Blue Mountain.

7
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,566
This is amazing.

8
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,276
Prepare my brunch.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,536
I want cheonggukjang.

10
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,836
What should I have for dinner?

11
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,966
Perhaps, the centre heel of shank.

12
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:46,266
[He's like an old man.]

13
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,636
[Who lives next door?]

14
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,066
[Luxurious]

15
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,366
[Lee Kwang Soo, the heir to a real estate tycoon]

16
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,606
Where am I?

17
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:06,376
I remember now.

18
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:08,906
I had too much wine at last night's party.

19
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,846
So I fell asleep in my dog's house.

20
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,606
Ouch.

21
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,276
(Kwang Soo, a party maniac, has a friend who's exactly the opposite.)

22
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,376
(Yu Jae Seok, the heir to an esteemed family)

23
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,506
Who gave you the permission to film here?

24
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,106
Get out.

25
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:30,746
I said, get out.

26
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:32,646
Wait a minute. Johnson.

27
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:34,846
Johnson.

28
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,306
(They have butlers and even private pilots.)

29
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:37,406
Hello? Captain Choi.

30
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,576
Please refuel the jet.

31
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,206
How long will it take?

32
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:43,846
Three minutes?

33
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:46,006
It shouldn't take that long.

34
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,906
(He's taking a chartered plane to visit his neighbour, Gary.)

35
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,006
Yes, hello?

36
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:53,506
I'm going to...

37
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,306
the States to study music.

38
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:56,906
Yes, I know.

39
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:00,376
I know you can make me a king. But...

40
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,906
I don't want to be tied down by you any more.

41
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,106
(The free-spirited Gary is...)

42
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,706
Hello? Father. This is your daughter speaking.

43
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,216
What?

44
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:09,406
You want me to marry him?

45
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,306
(A forced marriage)

46
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,746
Why are you doing this to me?

47
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:15,646
He may be very wealthy, but...

48
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:18,806
we don't belong together.

49
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,006
Yes, hello?

50
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:23,106
How is the investment going?

51
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,006
Put 270 million dollars in the Dubai account.

52
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,576
Actually, make that 300 million.

53
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:28,776
I'll use the leftover money for lunch.

54
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,306
Also,

55
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,776
I'm going to eat hot pot in Shanghai. So prepare my jet.

56
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,006
The third jet. The third jet.

57
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:39,106
The new model. The one I just bought.

58
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,406
The one that you can fold.

59
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,306
This guy can't do anything right.

60
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,406
What is that?

61
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,906
I'm too busy for this.

62
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,406
What...

63
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,306
Who is this invitation from?

64
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:57,006
(He receives it and then hands it right back.)

65
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,506
Take it. I don't need it.

66
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,406
- Take it. - Read it.

67
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:02,506
(He's annoyed.)

68
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,106
"This is an invitation."

69
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,576
"Dear Running Man,"

70
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:06,906
"Dear Running Man,"

71
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,306
"You have been chosen as the heir to the House."

72
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:12,676
"You have been chosen as the heir to the House."

73
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,876
"Come to this location to take part in the Game of the Heirs."

74
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,906
"Take part in the Game of the Heirs."

75
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:18,906
The Game of the Heirs?

76
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,406
What?

77
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:22,106
I'm already an heir.

78
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,776
I don't need to play games.

79
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,406
Well, let's go to the party.

80
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:31,406
(The seven heirs have been invited to the House's Game of the Heirs.)

81
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,306
I was bored anyway. Let's go.

82
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:34,576
Where do I have to go?

83
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:39,606
(Game of the Heirs, the House.)

84
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:45,206
(Episode 1: The beginning of the Territory War)

85
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,506
This isn't my house.

86
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:51,746
It's been 20 years since I last saw this house.

87
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,306
Did you see that just now?

88
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,876
So that I don't suffer...

89
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,106
That's why...

90
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,406
- Hello. - Hello.

91
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,606
- Hello. - Wow.

92
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:01,876
This is a nice view.

93
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,006
Is this the House?

94
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:04,106
Is this it?

95
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:05,576
- Oh, come on. - What is this place?

96
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,676
This house is quite impressive.

97
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:09,746
Let's go.

98
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,646
Is this the entrance?

99
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:12,906
(The seven heirs enter the House.)

100
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:15,406
- I don't want to take my shoes off. - What is this place?

101
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:17,016
What is this?

102
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:22,016
(The hardwood compliments the luxurious furnishing.)

103
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,306
(The House is a large, three-storey house.)

104
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:26,846
What is this place?

105
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,516
(However...)

106
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,306
Why does the floor have grids?

107
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,376
- It's for the game. - Isn't this for hopscotch?

108
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,406
They're for the game.

109
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,106
I think we're going to play hopscotch.

110
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,976
- What's going on? - What's going on?

111
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:45,206
The entire house is divided into squares.

112
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:50,846
(What is the secret behind this house?)

113
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:54,906
- What the... - What is going on?

114
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,476
What's with the grids?

115
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,876
- What's going on? - What's with the grids?

116
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,846
- Isn't this for hopscotch? - I think you're right.

117
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,706
We're going to play hopscotch.

118
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,106
The entire house is divided into squares.

119
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,206
Here...

120
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:10,516
(All who enter this house...)

121
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,906
(must play the game, whether they like it or not.)

122
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:19,306
(What exactly is the House's Game of the Heirs?)

123
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:21,906
- Your... - What?

124
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,776
(What?)

125
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,306
What is this...

126
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,576
(There is someone in the House.)

127
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,206
Hello.

128
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,206
- Hello. - What brings you here?

129
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,776
Hello.

130
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,706
Heirs, please come out to the front yard.

131
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,276
- To the front yard? - To the front yard?

132
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:40,306
- The front yard? - But...

133
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,506
But...

134
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,806
It's such a cold day.

135
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,106
What are you doing without...

136
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,706
- a coat in this weather? - Where are my shoes?

137
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:48,806
- This is such a... - What...

138
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:49,906
brings you to this place?

139
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,476
- She's beautiful. - What?

140
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,906
(Lim Ji Yeon)

141
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:57,476
(After debuting in a movie,)

142
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:02,106
(she excelled in many dramas and variety programmes.)

143
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,276
(The charming actress, Lim Ji Yeon, played diverse roles.)

144
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,476
I will continue to try my best. Thank you very much.

145
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,876
Ji Yeon, what are you...

146
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,706
- doing here? - Right.

147
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,746
Don't do that.

148
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:17,806
(Let me put this on you.)

149
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,006
Please.

150
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:21,906
(He threw it away.)

151
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,706
(She doesn't need...)

152
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,406
(Kwang Soo's clothes.)

153
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,276
I got this from a sponsor.

154
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,206
Come over here.

155
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:36,476
She's beautiful.

156
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:37,806
She looks even prettier...

157
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,306
- in person. - What brings you here?

158
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:42,406
I am Lim Ji Yeon, the proxy to the heir of the House.

159
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:45,206
And I will be your hostess today.

160
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,306
Oh, you're today's hostess.

161
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:50,506
I will now explain the rules...

162
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,506
- of the Game of the Heirs. - Right.

163
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,646
- The game itself is very simple. - Right.

164
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,976
The House is currently divided into 119 pieces.

165
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:01,106
You claim your territory by covering the floor with your floor piece.

166
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,806
Then, by participating in various missions,

167
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:07,106
you can steal other people's territory to expand your own.

168
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,606
(The first hopscotch game ever in Running Man)

169
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,406
I will begin by giving each of you a House Deed.

170
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,576
- A House Deed? - Yes, if you get all the deeds...

171
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,476
and claim the entire territory of the House, you win.

172
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:20,576
The House Deed.

173
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:24,406
(They can inherit the House by obtaining all seven House Deeds.)

174
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,476
If you take away...

175
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:27,876
- someone's House Deed, - I'm not interested in it.

176
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:30,276
you will own that person's territory...

177
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:31,906
as well as the House Deed.

178
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:35,376
(When you obtain the House Deed, you earn that person's area too.)

179
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,676
The person who loses the House Deed will be eliminated from the game.

180
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,776
(You're out once you lose the House Deed?)

181
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:47,376
(You become the servant of the person who took the deed.)

182
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,576
During the game, you may only move within your area.

183
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,206
We can't go to another person's area?

184
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,306
If you must go through another person's area,

185
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,676
you need to pay a toll.

186
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:57,776
How much is the toll?

187
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,006
- We need to claim the pieces first. - Everyone will get...

188
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,306
the same initial capital.

189
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,476
- Kitchen and the bathroom. - You'll be given 30 R-Money.

190
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:03,876
- How many? - 30 coins.

191
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,476
- You're standing the nearest. - 30...

192
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,006
- Why can't you hear her? - Even I can hear from here.

193
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,206
- You're standing right next to her. - Why can't you hear her?

194
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,306
- Seok Jin needs... - We can hear everything.

195
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,576
- a hearing aid. - He can't hear anything.

196
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,876
- I was lost in her beauty. - Buy a hearing aid with R-Money.

197
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,576
Her voice deafened my ears.

198
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,676
- Her face is just too beautiful. - You need a hearing aid.

199
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:19,846
- All right. - Okay.

200
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,206
I will get all the House Deeds...

201
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,306
and give them to you, Ji Yeon.

202
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,676
Gosh.

203
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:24,776
What's up with your voice?

204
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:26,676
Everything you see is yours.

205
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:28,906
I wish you...

206
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:30,906
luck, everyone.

207
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,116
- That was lovely. - Shoot again.

208
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,476
(She shoots hearts to Seok Jin.)

209
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,006
You can't step on my land!

210
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:39,506
Give me three coins each!

211
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:40,846
This is a scam!

212
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:42,006
You swindlers!

213
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,306
(The Territory War has begun.)

214
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,206
You stepped on my land.

215
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,306
You stepped on my land.

216
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,306
I have my land!

217
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,476
(Who will earn all seven deeds and inherit The House?)

218
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:56,676
(The first mission will determine the initial area of their land.)

219
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,906
Ji Yeon, I came first.

220
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,116
Ji Yeon.

221
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:07,006
- Ji Yeon, aren't you cold? - Everyone,

222
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,376
- please come out to the front yard. - It's so cold.

223
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,306
- You're completely ignoring me. - Ji Yeon.

224
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,116
- Hey! - Your health comes first, Ji Yeon.

225
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,876
- Am I invisible? - Ji Yeon!

226
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,006
- Ji Yeon, here. - You will freeze to death.

227
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,976
- Ji Yeon, it's freezing. - Your outfit is not...

228
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,476
- appropriate for this weather. - Here, Ji Yeon.

229
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,006
Please go on.

230
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,676
- Please go on. - Okay.

231
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,676
Now, the first territory fight of the heirs will begin.

232
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,476
It's Seven-member name-tag-ripping...

233
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,906
- Race. - What? We have to rip...

234
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,676
- the name tags again? - Yes. You will line up...

235
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,576
according to the given order.

236
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:35,476
Then you will rip the name tag of the person in front of you.

237
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,476
We will rip the name tag while running?

238
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,006
You will be ranked according to the order of your elimination.

239
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,206
- Okay. - Okay.

240
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,576
(The last person remaining will rank number one.)

241
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,676
According to the game result...

242
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,976
According to the game result...

243
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,676
(Gary's face cracks her up.)

244
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,906
What? Why is she laughing?

245
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,306
He reminded you of squid, didn't he?

246
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,476
Ji Yeon.

247
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:55,476
- He reminds you of squid. - He reminds you of squid, right?

248
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:56,906
The squids cost 28 dollars per bag.

249
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,276
- You like it, don't you? - Gary's sells it at a cheap price.

250
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:00,776
It's my first time making a stranger laugh with my face.

251
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:01,906
- Ji Yeon. - Yes.

252
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,676
- Depending on the game result, - Yes.

253
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:07,006
the initial area of your land will be determined.

254
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,306
- So, please do your best. - Okay.

255
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,906
- I see. - It's a very important game.

256
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,476
She talks so well.

257
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:13,876
- She explains the important rules. - Yes.

258
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,846
I will now pick the person who will stand on the first spot.

259
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:17,976
Please do.

260
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,116
You should go inside if you can't take the cold weather.

261
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,006
Spots are spaced at equal distances.

262
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,676
- Kim Jong Kook. - It's the worst.

263
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:23,846
Right.

264
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,306
- We can't catch him. - It's Kim Jong Kook.

265
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,676
- I knew it. - I'm on Spot One.

266
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,116
- How can we catch him? - I stand there?

267
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:30,206
Do I stand there? Okay.

268
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,576
Please don't make me get Spot Two.

269
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:34,206
- I hope it isn't me. - Is it Spot Two next?

270
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:35,476
- Please be careful with your hand. - I just have to avoid Spot Two.

271
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:36,776
- Is it Spot Two now? - Please.

272
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,306
I just have to avoid this one.

273
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:39,476
Oh, it's me!

274
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:40,676
(I just have to avoid this one. Oh, it's me!)

275
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:44,116
(He's in front of Jong Kook.)

276
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:45,676
Oh, dear.

277
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,206
(Seok Jin is most likely to be eliminated first.)

278
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,676
Why did it have to be me?

279
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:50,876
- Why me? - Bravo.

280
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:52,846
- Good timing. - It's brilliant.

281
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,406
- I have a good feeling about today. - Good job.

282
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,106
Spot Three is perfect.

283
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,406
Please let me get Spot Three.

284
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:58,776
Spot Three goes to Ji Hyo.

285
00:10:58,876 --> 00:10:59,906
You go there, Ji Hyo!

286
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:01,476
- You go to Spot Three. - Where are you going?

287
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:02,876
- Spot Three. - Now it's Spot Four.

288
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:04,106
It's not bad.

289
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,306
- It's Haha. - Yes!

290
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:06,406
Yes! It's perfect.

291
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,406
Spot Five goes to Gary.

292
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,006
(He has to fight with Haha again.)

293
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,776
I will go and catch the squid.

294
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,876
Spot Six and Seven are bad.

295
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,006
(They will be either chased by Gary or Jong Kook.)

296
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,276
Both spots are bad.

297
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:19,006
Let's see.

298
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,376
- Jae Seok. - Gosh!

299
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:22,476
No!

300
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,006
(Kwang Soo automatically gets Spot Seven.)

301
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,476
It's the spot I hate the most!

302
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:28,776
(He will be standing in between Jae Seok and Jong Kook.)

303
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,876
Wait. I don't know about this.

304
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:35,906
What do you mean?

305
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,206
- I don't know. - What do you mean?

306
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:38,476
You are going to fail first.

307
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:40,306
I'm standing on the straight line.

308
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:41,776
You have to do well at the start.

309
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:45,576
My name tag could fall when I run.

310
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:48,106
You're right.

311
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,506
- It's going to fall while running. - Hey.

312
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,576
- It won't. - It's only fair..

313
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,676
- like this. - What are you doing?

314
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,906
Gosh.

315
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,776
The tag needs to be on like this.

316
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,776
When Ji Yeon blows the whistle...

317
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,406
Hey! Your spot is right here. Where are you going?

318
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,376
- Hey! - Okay. Okay.

319
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,776
No cheating.

320
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,106
Ready.

321
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,276
(This game will determine the initial area of their land.)

322
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:11,906
Run!

323
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,006
(The game starts.)

324
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,276
Run!

325
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,676
Run!

326
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:20,906
Run!

327
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,006
(Seok Jin)

328
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,906
(Jong Kook chases Seok Jin.)

329
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:26,406
(Kwang Soo chases Jong Kook.)

330
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,206
(Jae Seok chases Kwang Soo.)

331
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:29,676
(Gary chases Jae Seok.)

332
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,206
(Haha chases Gary.)

333
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,906
(Ji Hyo chases Haha.)

334
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:36,676
(They run along...)

335
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:40,106
(the food chain.)

336
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:42,106
(Screaming)

337
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,476
(There's a strong chance Seok Jin will be eliminated first.)

338
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:46,576
Hey!

339
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:48,576
(Ji Hyo is far away.)

340
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,706
Stop there!

341
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,006
(Speeding up)

342
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,306
Ji Hyo!

343
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,676
Ji Hyo!

344
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,106
(Jong Kook rips Seok Jin's name tag.)

345
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:04,906
(He's about to be caught.)

346
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:05,906
Ji Hyo!

347
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:10,306
(Kwang Soo caught up with Jong Kook while he was busy with Seok Jin.)

348
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,676
(Jong Kook is out.)

349
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:20,306
(Jae Seok is right behind him.)

350
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,406
Wait!

351
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,876
(Kwang Soo tries to fight.)

352
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,676
Hey!

353
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:32,376
(Thanks to Kwang Soo buying time,)

354
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:36,576
(Haha rips Gary's name tag.)

355
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:40,376
(Several people got their name tags ripped in an instant.)

356
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:41,576
I...

357
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,476
You're late.

358
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,906
(When there are two people left, they can rip each other's tag.)

359
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:47,676
- Hey! - Look at Ji Hyo.

360
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,506
She's still running.

361
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:50,676
(Her endurance level is high.)

362
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,206
(But he's exhausted.)

363
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,006
Ji Hyo's so strong.

364
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,406
Are you running a marathon?

365
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,006
Please finish the game now!

366
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,576
Is this a marathon?

367
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,006
(Now it's an endurance battle.)

368
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:06,276
Please finish the game now!

369
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:07,406
Is this a marathon?

370
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,676
Please finish it now.

371
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,106
Ji Hyo's unbelievable.

372
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:15,846
Haha's finally spurting.

373
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:16,906
- Look at him. - Hey!

374
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,376
He's really slow. He's slow.

375
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,306
He's really slow. He's slow.

376
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:24,476
Your shoelaces are loose.

377
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:25,906
(He's already worn off.)

378
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:28,576
The order is really important.

379
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:29,776
He ripped my tag.

380
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:31,676
(Haha wins.)

381
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:32,876
I did it.

382
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,906
- Haha won. - The little one won.

383
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,006
All right.

384
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,776
All right.

385
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,576
Gosh.

386
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,776
- What? - You can never do it alone.

387
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,676
Gosh!

388
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:46,406
(At this counter, they will get the R-Money and floor pieces.)

389
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:47,576
Go to the bank counter...

390
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:49,876
and get your R-Money and floor pieces.

391
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,576
(These colourful floor pieces will mark each member's territory.)

392
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,906
- This is the initial capital? - Only the land.

393
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:56,876
It's the initial capital.

394
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,206
This is the initial capital, right?

395
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:00,476
- That's right. - Aren't your hands cold?

396
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,476
- My hands are cold. - Ji Yeon, you must be cold.

397
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,306
- Here you go. - Thanks.

398
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,006
You get yellow floor pieces.

399
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,206
They give us floor pieces?

400
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,576
He got yellow ones.

401
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,376
- Is this for my land? - That's right.

402
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,306
(Haha will get 30 blue floor pieces.)

403
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:16,576
Here you go.

404
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,006
It's mine? Wait.

405
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,106
Gosh, he got so many.

406
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,776
I have the most.

407
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:23,476
He's a genius.

408
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:25,676
Okay.

409
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:27,476
(Haha got 30 floor pieces.)

410
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,206
I will decide where to put my House Deed first.

411
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,306
(He will first choose the location of the House Deed.)

412
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:34,676
(Where should I hide it?)

413
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:37,676
Each member will get a House Deed.

414
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:40,206
If you take the floor piece...

415
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:41,576
- with the House Deed, - I'm not interested in it.

416
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,876
you get to claim that person's territory...

417
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:45,676
as well as his House Deed.

418
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,376
You get to claim that person's land as well as his House Deed.

419
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:51,276
And the person who loses it will be eliminated from the game.

420
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,906
(Moreover, he will become the servant of the one who took it.)

421
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,206
(It's going to be an intense strategy fight.)

422
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:55,776
If you take all the seven House Deeds and...

423
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,406
claim all the lands, you will become the final winner.

424
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,876
The House Deed.

425
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,906
(So it's important to hide the deed in a strategic place.)

426
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:04,906
There you go.

427
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,306
(Nobody will find it, right?)

428
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:11,846
I want some ramyun.

429
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,476
(He will decide where to put the rest of the 29 floor pieces.)

430
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:14,876
I will mark my land now.

431
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:15,906
(He starts from the kitchen.)

432
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,006
This is Haha's.

433
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:19,306
Haha.

434
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:21,906
Eight, nine...

435
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,676
and 10. I wrote my names on all the pieces.

436
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:24,906
11.

437
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,306
11. I'll jump over here.

438
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,006
14.

439
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,206
15.

440
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,576
(He even takes the bathroom on the second floor.)

441
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,476
30. I'm done.

442
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,406
Brilliant. I took possession of all the bathrooms.

443
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:45,306
(In order to go to the bathroom or the kitchen, they have to pay Haha.)

444
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:48,776
(Haha can freely move around the two rooms as well.)

445
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:50,306
I can play the piano too.

446
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,376
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

447
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:58,576
Gosh.

448
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,906
Gosh, I knew it.

449
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,576
(He took the kitchen too.)

450
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,406
My strategy is amazing.

451
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,316
I basically got both floors under my control.

452
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:14,876
I took possession of all the bathrooms.

453
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,776
- Gosh... - I will take the room.

454
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,576
You are so mean to take the bathrooms.

455
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,576
You can just pay the toll.

456
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:22,576
(You can pay R-Money to walk past.)

457
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:23,906
This is mine.

458
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,746
You can have the living room.

459
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:33,006
(The entrance and corridor are aligned for an easy exit.)

460
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:41,906
(The shortest way to the second floor has been made.)

461
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,476
I'll put my House Deed here.

462
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:49,576
(The House Deed should be hidden well.)

463
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,376
There's none left.

464
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,106
You guys... Seriously.

465
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:02,876
There's nothing to take.

466
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,906
Should I take the bed for now?

467
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:09,906
Let me take the bed first.

468
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,646
If I can't take the toilet or the kitchen,

469
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,676
I will take the bed.

470
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,576
People usually don't want these areas in the corner.

471
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:22,106
(Haha has also hidden the House Deed.)

472
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:24,676
This is so evil. Who did this here?

473
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,676
This, here.

474
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,676
Don't step on my land!

475
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:33,676
- Was it you? - Please don't step on my land.

476
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:34,876
Who's land is this?

477
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,646
- It's my land. - They've done it over here as well.

478
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,476
There is nowhere to stick this.

479
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,876
Right, here.

480
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:43,746
(Jae Seok takes up the space on the second floor.)

481
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,906
I didn't know this was such an important game.

482
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,106
Do you ever know and act on it?

483
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:50,676
(How can you say such harsh words?)

484
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,106
- How can you talk like that? - Should I show you some land?

485
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,676
If there is some land, please show me.

486
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,746
This piece is already taken. There is another one.

487
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:01,476
- This one here. - I should probably buy this one.

488
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:04,006
- It's very warm here. - Yes, proceed quickly.

489
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:05,676
There are some pieces left.

490
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:08,006
(The only remaining area is the corner in the kitchen.)

491
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,506
I forgot about the kitchen area.

492
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:15,576
(Jong Kook takes 10 pieces in the kitchen.)

493
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,576
(Nearly every piece is taken.)

494
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:23,106
(Seok Jin can only take up to six pieces.)

495
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:25,576
What is this?

496
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,006
Do I need to pay, starting now?

497
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,676
- Seok Jin! - You are okay for now.

498
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:34,276
- There's nowhere to go. - No, where do I...

499
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:37,506
Seok Jin, you only have these extra pieces in the corner left.

500
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,376
You only have those near the air conditioner.

501
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:43,006
- Can I take this? - Yes, you can.

502
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,816
- It's okay, right? - There's no more land.

503
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:46,876
I'll take this.

504
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:50,276
Stay there and when we start the games, you can leave.

505
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,276
- But if I stay in there... - The important thing is...

506
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,846
Compared to the second floor, the land here is much better.

507
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,276
- There's more upstairs. - But I should still...

508
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,006
look around more since I am here to buy land.

509
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,876
- There is no more land here. - Jong Kook, here.

510
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:03,006
I've taken these.

511
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:05,476
There's actually no land left.

512
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,276
There may be more upstairs.

513
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:08,776
- There's some land over here. - Where?

514
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:09,876
There are two pieces.

515
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,816
Where?

516
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,906
Here? Is this all that's left?

517
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:17,376
- There are two pieces. - Can you use the bed?

518
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:18,476
Of course.

519
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:22,476
Wait, do we have to hide the House Deed?

520
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:23,576
Just put it over here.

521
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,906
I'm not that stupid.

522
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:26,846
I will place it over there.

523
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:28,876
My House Deed.

524
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,006
If you need the toilet, now would be a good time.

525
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,476
Yes, I agree.

526
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,106
That's right, I should go to the toilet.

527
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,906
An early visit to the toilet.

528
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,006
(What will happen in The House?)

529
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,276
(119 pieces in The House have been claimed.)

530
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:52,906
(Episode 2: The World of the Heirs)

531
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:55,006
This game must be advantageous for those who have more land.

532
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,006
(Ringing the bell)

533
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:00,106
What was that?

534
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,006
- Let's go. - Let's go downstairs.

535
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,376
Ji Yeon, I was the first person to arrive.

536
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:09,006
- Hello, you are here. - Hello, Ji Yeon.

537
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,106
- That's my land you are on. - Here.

538
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:12,676
Have you all chosen your lands?

539
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,276
- Yes, you can come to my land. - No, stay there.

540
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,906
- You can't do that. - Can everyone gather around here?

541
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,476
- Do we gather in the lounge? - Is it okay to step here now?

542
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,646
- Yes. - We can step on it now.

543
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:22,846
I will now explain the Basic Rules.

544
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,876
You'll start with 30 R-Money coins.

545
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,576
The toll price is three R-Money coins each.

546
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,376
It's three R-Money?

547
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:31,006
We have to pay three coins to pass?

548
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,576
I have a question.

549
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:35,106
- What if I go from here to here? - Go on.

550
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:37,276
Do I have to pay 6 coins because I took 2 steps?

551
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:40,276
- No. - No, three to move in the area.

552
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,476
And if you move elsewhere, you pay three more.

553
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,476
- Like this, to a different area. - That's how it works.

554
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,676
So I think to move around in this area, you have to spend 10 coins.

555
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:49,406
- I have a question too. - What if you use the stairs?

556
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,576
You can go up the stairs like this right?

557
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,006
- Surely. - You just stepped on the floor.

558
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,906
(Ji Hyo's area has been trespassed.)

559
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:58,576
You stepped on my land. That's my land.

560
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:00,376
- You stepped on it. - That's my land.

561
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,476
Hey.

562
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,406
- This might fall over. - You're on the light blue area.

563
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:05,406
(Everyone is keen on protecting their land.)

564
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,006
You stepped on my land. That's my land.

565
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,476
This might fall over. Be careful.

566
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,376
And when you buy land, each piece will cost you...

567
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:11,576
30 R-Money coins each.

568
00:22:11,676 --> 00:22:13,006
- We can buy land? - Okay.

569
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,646
And when you sell, you can sell each piece for 10 coins.

570
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:16,906
(What?)

571
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:19,476
Ji Yeon, be careful how you pronounce "10 coins".

572
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:22,006
- Be careful. - It is 10 coins.

573
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,676
- Were you a troublemaker before? - No, I was not.

574
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,646
- Right, when you sell... - I knew it.

575
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,476
When you get hungry, you can order food.

576
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,476
- Oh, you can do that? - Yes.

577
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:35,576
Pizza costs 15 R-Money coins, and chicken costs 10 coins.

578
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,776
Do we only get two options?

579
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:39,006
Yes, there are only two options.

580
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,406
I can't eat those.

581
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:43,476
Well, do you want chicken breast ordered in?

582
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:45,476
- But still, you know. - There's ramyun over there.

583
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:47,106
- I want some yukgaejang. - We can have that, right?

584
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:48,906
- Within our areas. - Yes, if it is your area.

585
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:51,676
Yes. Only if it is within your area.

586
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,876
When the bell rings, the game will begin.

587
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,106
If you just stand by...

588
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,576
Okay. Thank you, Ji Yeon. Bye.

589
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:58,476
- Who wants some ramyun? - Thank you.

590
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,276
- We start from now on, right? - Yes, we start now.

591
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:02,906
(Hopscotch of the Heirs begins now.)

592
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,646
Everyone, you cannot step on each other's lands, okay?

593
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,906
I don't care now.

594
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:10,276
- I'm tired. - I don't care.

595
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:11,276
Goodness.

596
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,576
I do apologise but since this is my land,

597
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:16,276
can you film elsewhere?

598
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,106
Be nice to my cameraman. He's my cameraman.

599
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:20,846
Exactly, I'm telling him to go because he is not my cameraman.

600
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,006
(Nothing to say.)

601
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,876
I'm sorry, but whose team are you on?

602
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,106
If you are on Ji Hyo's team, please film over there.

603
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,476
This is trespassing.

604
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,006
We are all quite sensitive at the moment, so please do understand.

605
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:34,876
Right. Goodness.

606
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:38,006
(This is nice.)

607
00:23:38,646 --> 00:23:40,806
I'm going to go to the bedroom, okay?

608
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:42,906
I'm going to lie down for a bit.

609
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,276
(Let me have some of my own bedtime.)

610
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,276
(Sighing)

611
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:50,576
Seriously.

612
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,276
(Jong Kook has to lie on the floor, unlike Haha.)

613
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:55,006
I'm good here, but because we have to leave the door open,

614
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,806
the cold air comes in here.

615
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,276
I can go over there, right?

616
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:03,646
- To where? - From here to there.

617
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,576
- You have to jump. - You'll have to jump.

618
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,646
If you step elsewhere, you know it is three R-Money, right?

619
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,006
What are you going there for?

620
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,276
- Because I want to go over there. - Yes, that's right.

621
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:12,476
(It is necessary for the toilet.)

622
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:13,576
Give it a go.

623
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:17,006
Wait.

624
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:18,506
(Oh, no.)

625
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,006
(He falls on both Jae Seok's and Ji Hyo's areas.)

626
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:23,476
- Come over here, now. - That's three coins.

627
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:25,006
That's unfair.

628
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,576
- Blocking the path to my land. - Pay me three coins.

629
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,676
- Give me three coins. - The first one to pay!

630
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,406
- It's three coins. - Yes, give it to me.

631
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:31,676
You lied on my land.

632
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,476
I can't go anywhere if you are going to be this stingy.

633
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:34,646
It's three coins, please.

634
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,906
I should sit by here whenever people go to toilet.

635
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:38,576
Yes, you should do that.

636
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,376
- This is so unfair. - I can go to the toilet.

637
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,576
I can take this way.

638
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:42,906
Where?

639
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,106
(Walking along the wall, tip-toeing.)

640
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,276
What if I stand here?

641
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:47,976
(Crashing)

642
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:50,106
Give me 3 coins! 3 coins!

643
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:52,576
It's 3 coins for me! 3 coins for me!

644
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:54,106
(Seok Jin stepped on three areas all at once.)

645
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,006
Hurry up, give me my R-Money.

646
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,276
(Why did I try?)

647
00:24:57,906 --> 00:24:58,906
It's like Jayu-ro.

648
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,576
This is the best place ever.

649
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:03,276
- This is the best. - That will earn a lot of money.

650
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,806
This area is the best.

651
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:06,376
Hurry up, give it to me.

652
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,906
Who put oil on the wall over here?

653
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,576
Give it to me.

654
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,906
- I feel so stressed. - Kwang Soo needs to pay, too.

655
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,846
No, I fell here.

656
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:17,376
You fell on mine too.

657
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,646
Gosh. Here, three coins.

658
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:20,906
You need to give them another three coins too.

659
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:24,376
If you can't reach,

660
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,276
I will pass your money. Pay me one coin as commission.

661
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,776
That's so evil.

662
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,006
You guys cannot reach each other, right?

663
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,276
- This guy is strange. - You are such a rip-off.

664
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:35,646
I'm not ripping you off. This is what landlords do.

665
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:37,746
Throw it, throw it.

666
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:39,876
(Catching)

667
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,006
I caught it.

668
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,576
Give me the rest two coins.

669
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,106
I'll give you 2 but I will keep 1.

670
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:47,476
I paid three coins.

671
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,576
Right.

672
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,376
- What is wrong with him? - He's like a loan-shark.

673
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:54,006
I'm not a loan-shark.

674
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:56,276
(Talking sound)

675
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,106
Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.

676
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:03,906
I feel like... I have no dream.

677
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:07,006
I lost all my motivation because I have no dream.

678
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:10,506
I don't feel the urge to do anything.

679
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:15,676
This is why hope is important.

680
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:18,106
Shall we have some ramyun?

681
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:20,276
Let's have one when we are a bit more hungry.

682
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:22,276
He is in a very good spot.

683
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:24,276
I can just go and cook some, right?

684
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,476
Yes, you can.

685
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,376
(How will he enter the kitchen when it belongs to Haha?)

686
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,776
He linked them all the way up there. That's great.

687
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:32,476
(Trying to defend)

688
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,006
You can't push me. You can't do that.

689
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:38,906
No, wait.

690
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:39,906
Can you push like that?

691
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:43,106
It's not like I don't have my land here.

692
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,576
Come on.

693
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,276
See what happens when you step on my land. Jong Kook's here.

694
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:54,376
Hey, let's just cook some ramyun together.

695
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,006
- Let's have some together. - In the end, we'll have to...

696
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,006
Excuse me.

697
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,276
Rich people.

698
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:03,906
- Rich people. - Let's have some together please.

699
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,276
Let's have some together.

700
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,806
(Ramyun was here earlier.)

701
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,106
- Pay up. - There's no ramyun here.

702
00:27:10,906 --> 00:27:12,006
There's no ramyun?

703
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:13,876
Kwang Soo.

704
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:16,646
Someone stole the ramyun.

705
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,676
They stole it from the beginning.

706
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:19,876
What are you looking for?

707
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:20,906
Are you looking for this?

708
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,006
(Oh my goodness!)

709
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:29,876
Do you think you can cook without using my kitchen?

710
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:32,106
I won't use your kitchen. I'll just eat uncooked ramyun.

711
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,106
- Will you? - Yes.

712
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:36,006
I can't believe him.

713
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:39,506
- I'll take this. - There's no more area left.

714
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,276
I can put it under this, right?

715
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:42,376
(When the others were busy,)

716
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:44,506
They'll never use this.

717
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:50,676
(Jae Seok steps into the kitchen.)

718
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:56,276
(He spots ramyun and instant rice.)

719
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,206
(What shall I do with these?)

720
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:04,876
(He steals them right away.)

721
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,776
It's okay because the game hasn't begun yet.

722
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:10,206
Isn't it okay to take them now?

723
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,576
These will be useful later.

724
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,376
(He tidies up the area.)

725
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,106
It doesn't matter that they're in his area now.

726
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:20,906
Finders keepers.

727
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:22,676
Nobody else can take theses.

728
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,106
- I can't believe what you did. - Seriously.

729
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,606
Give me one instant rice.

730
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:32,106
I'll give you some ramyun, if you'll share.

731
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:34,106
No, that's okay. Just eat it uncooked.

732
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,776
- Don't you want them? - No, thanks. I have microwave.

733
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:39,206
- No, thank you. - We'll all starve.

734
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,376
Do we really need to be this dirty?

735
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:44,406
Can't we just live in peace?

736
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,506
Can't we?

737
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:47,976
(Let's just live peacefully.)

738
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:49,876
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

739
00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:52,276
I'll cook you some ramyun, if you give me one instant rice.

740
00:28:52,676 --> 00:28:54,606
Don't you think that's unfair?

741
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:57,306
Those were originally mine. They were in my area before.

742
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,776
Well, that was when we could...

743
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,276
walk around freely.

744
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,776
- That was before the game started. - What do you mean?

745
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,776
- Come on. - Do you want to get locked up?

746
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:07,876
Come and catch me then.

747
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:09,576
You're driving me crazy.

748
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,276
- Shall I go get you? - Pay the toll then come get me.

749
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,376
- Goodness. - I'll cook you ramyun.

750
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,906
Okay, cook ramyun for me then.

751
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,876
- All right. - Let's all eat together.

752
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:22,006
- Yes. - It's sad being so poor.

753
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,406
(Jae Seok passes the ramyun to Haha.)

754
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:26,876
Let's cook seven since there are seven of us.

755
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,376
- I should've been near the kitchen. - Darn.

756
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:31,306
Should I just not feed them?

757
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:32,406
- Let's not. - Don't feed them.

758
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:34,676
Why should we feed them?

759
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:36,106
- Right. Don't. - I can't go far.

760
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:37,206
He won't feed us.

761
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,576
- What? - Haha won't feed us.

762
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:41,206
I'm sorry.

763
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:42,876
(Sorry, I changed my mind.)

764
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,506
- What are you saying? - Let's not feed them.

765
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,776
Hey, you!

766
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:47,106
(You can't do that!)

767
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:48,276
They lied to us!

768
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:49,676
You little thieves!

769
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:53,006
- How could you? - Pay the toll then!

770
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:55,776
This is an issue of trust.

771
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:57,306
Hey. Are you really...

772
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:58,646
- not going to give us any? - This is not right.

773
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:00,876
Look who's talking about trust.

774
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:02,876
Wait a minute.

775
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:06,406
He doesn't even have any land. Why is he over there?

776
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:08,306
I can't believe him.

777
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,876
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

778
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,776
I'll let you step on my land, so go persuade them.

779
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,776
He can't step on your land. You'll have to carry him.

780
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,106
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

781
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,276
How?

782
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:19,506
Why not? Come here.

783
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,506
- You can't. - I want to eat.

784
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,676
- Wait. - That's not important.

785
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:24,776
Hey, Ji Hyo.

786
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:26,606
Hey.

787
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:29,006
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - I'll drop you here.

788
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:30,876
You stepped on it!

789
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:32,406
- I'll drop you here. - Hey.

790
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:33,906
You stepped on it!

791
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,776
- My land! - You stepped on it!

792
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,876
- Give me three coins. - Blue land!

793
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,306
- Three coins. - Hey.

794
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,506
- Ji Hyo. - Give me three coins.

795
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:42,676
(You betrayed me!)

796
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,776
You should've landed on your feet.

797
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,506
- I carried you. - I can't believe this.

798
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:47,606
I get it now.

799
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:48,906
This is war.

800
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:50,276
No, I didn't mean it.

801
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,406
Hey, Ji Hyo.

802
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:53,106
- No. - Give me three coins.

803
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:56,506
- Hey, Haha. - I'll give you ramyun.

804
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,106
- Just sit down. - Tell Seok Jin...

805
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:59,676
and Kwang Soo to apologise.

806
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,776
Come out and say sorry.

807
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:03,676
Where would I go?

808
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,106
- Okay. - Just say sorry first.

809
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,006
- Go. - Tell them to come here.

810
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,376
- Get up. - Go apologise.

811
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,206
(Oh, no!)

812
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:16,106
(Kwang Soo pulls Seok Jin.)

813
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,206
(They both fall.)

814
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,006
(Kwang Soo falls down with Seok Jin.)

815
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:21,576
Hey, get up.

816
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,406
- Get up, Kwang Soo. - Come on.

817
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,676
I can't believe you guys.

818
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,106
- Hey. - How could you do that?

819
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:30,106
- Hey. - Come on.

820
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:36,306
- I'll give you free ramyun. - Okay.

821
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:39,006
If you want to eat, come to the table.

822
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:40,906
- Okay. - Can I eat if I go to the table?

823
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,576
- Let's eat. - Can I eat if I go there?

824
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:44,676
Of course.

825
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:46,506
What are you doing?

826
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,006
I don't have much money.

827
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:51,006
I think you can make it.

828
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,376
I have to get there.

829
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,576
What is he doing?

830
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,406
Let's put this in.

831
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:57,876
He can make it.

832
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,106
(He slowly makes his way to the table.)

833
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:04,876
(Panting)

834
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,106
Haha, I'm here!

835
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,646
(He is cautious.)

836
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:11,006
- Wait, Ji Hyo. - Is Kwang Soo there?

837
00:32:11,276 --> 00:32:13,206
- I made it. - Please carry me.

838
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:14,776
(Can I get a ride?)

839
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,476
- That's great. - Oh, boy.

840
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:19,906
- Thanks. - Take me too.

841
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,406
- Move over please. - Give me a ride too.

842
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,276
(Ji Hyo carries Seok Jin this time.)

843
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:28,006
For goodness' sake. You're so heavy.

844
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:29,106
Quickly.

845
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:31,276
I'm here.

846
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:32,676
Please take your seats.

847
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,006
Can I sit on the chair?

848
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:36,006
Shall I go on the table?

849
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:37,376
- You can't use the chair. - This?

850
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,006
- Why not? - You should...

851
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,206
eat on the grass.

852
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,106
Okay. We'll have to eat on the grass.

853
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,576
- Stand up. - What are you doing?

854
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:45,776
What's this?

855
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,746
(I'm going down.)

856
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,776
- What's this? - Hey, Kwang Soo.

857
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,106
- He slid. - Oh, boy.

858
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,276
(Kwang Soo screams.)

859
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,646
(Haha steps on Kwang Soo.)

860
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,106
- Okay. - He stepped on it.

861
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,576
- Pay three coins. - He's squandering his money.

862
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,606
- Pay three coins. - Hey.

863
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:07,376
You don't even have that much money.

864
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:09,776
He's too indulgent.

865
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:12,676
- You've been here too long. - Who's that sitting over there?

866
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:15,506
- Hey. - Are you eating uncooked ramyun?

867
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,906
He must be really hungry.

868
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,406
- He's been sitting there. - Hey.

869
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:24,006
- That's his spot. - I have nothing to lose.

870
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,106
- I'm going. - Jong Kook is dirt poor.

871
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:30,406
Just be a slave.

872
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,776
He doesn't have any land. What's he doing there?

873
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:35,376
It's driving me crazy.

874
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,876
He must be very hungry.

875
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,876
- I can't believe he's eating that. - I know.

876
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:42,576
- What is he doing up there? - Come down.

877
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,106
Let's do something.

878
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:45,576
Let's play a game or something.

879
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,576
(I want some action.)

880
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:52,776
I have nothing to lose.

881
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,006
It's ready.

882
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:56,476
Here it comes.

883
00:33:58,106 --> 00:34:01,906
(It seems like everyone has been starving.)

884
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,406
- It's delicious. - It's good.

885
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,606
It's really delicious.

886
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,406
- It's good. - It's delicious.

887
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:10,006
- Who wants some more? - I do.

888
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,676
(Everyone is busy eating.)

889
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:16,676
(But Jong Kook prepares himself mentally for the next game.)

890
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,776
- This is great. - Take some more.

891
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,106
- Hey, Jae Seok. - Yes?

892
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:23,106
Just pay the toll and get in here.

893
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:26,006
Just pay two coins.

894
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:28,006
- Don't be stingy. - Exactly.

895
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:29,476
He's actually right.

896
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:31,276
- Just do it. - Pay the toll.

897
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,006
Let me pay just two coins.

898
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:34,606
- This orange one here. - My land?

899
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:35,776
- Yes. - Okay.

900
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,406
- Two coins. - Wait, one coin for this one.

901
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:40,506
What are you doing? Are you renting out my land?

902
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:43,406
- No, I wasn't. - Come on.

903
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:44,646
- You can't do that. - No.

904
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,276
- I'm already here. - I'll take two coins.

905
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,106
- Will you? - Yes.

906
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:49,876
- Don't be like that. - You can't do that.

907
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,676
- Let's share. - This is great.

908
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,376
You have to spend your money.

909
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:56,006
What Gary said is so true.

910
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,476
- What? - I shouldn't be stingy.

911
00:34:58,746 --> 00:34:59,906
(Jong Kook didn't spend any money yet.)

912
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,506
That is so true.

913
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:03,776
Jong Kook is clever.

914
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,276
He didn't spend any money, eating uncooked ramyun...

915
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:07,676
to avoid the toll.

916
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,776
(Jong Kook didn't move at all for an hour.)

917
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,406
He could become a slave later.

918
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:13,106
He'll regret not spending any money...

919
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,476
when he becomes a slave.

920
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:18,106
Hurry up and finish eating. Let's go play some games.

921
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:19,776
- Okay. - I have nothing to lose.

922
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:22,276
(I'll show you what I can do.)

923
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:32,876
[Episode 3: Jong Kook Strikes Back]

924
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:35,106
(It's time.)

925
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,676
- Let's go. - Give me three coins.

926
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:41,106
Come here. This is my land.

927
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,676
- Okay. - Ji Hyo.

928
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:43,876
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

929
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:45,106
Can you carry me please?

930
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,606
- I made it. - It's cold.

931
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:47,676
(He's being careful not to step on others' lands.)

932
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,406
What's all this?

933
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,506
Everyone, please come on out.

934
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:54,376
Here comes the great landowner.

935
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:55,876
Hello, everyone.

936
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,006
- Hello, Sir. - Hello.

937
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,476
- He has the most land. - Yes.

938
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:00,646
I can't take this any more.

939
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,906
(Jong Kook is feeling competitive.)

940
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:04,506
- Are you all here? - Yes.

941
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:07,646
You will play a game and have your rankings determined.

942
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,506
Rankings 1, 2 and 3 will get the right to steal others' land.

943
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:11,646
- What? - Stealing land?

944
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,506
(It's my chance to take over.)

945
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:14,646
- That's right. - How many pieces?

946
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:17,106
You will play "Bubble Wrestle" game.

947
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,216
(If you win, you can steal other people's land.)

948
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,906
- You will all wear bubbles. - Okay.

949
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:21,906
- You'll push each other out. - I see.

950
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:24,776
By the way, are you hosting TV shows now...

951
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:26,506
instead of acting?

952
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,606
(She feels embarrassed.)

953
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,276
- You're good at it. - You are.

954
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,406
- You're good at this. - Aren't you...

955
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,776
hosting some other show?

956
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:34,406
- Yes, I host "Section TV". - That's right.

957
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:37,006
- Right. - That's why you're so good.

958
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:38,646
- That's why. - The way she talks...

959
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,006
- is so lovely. - I see.

960
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,106
What did you say?

961
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,216
The way she talks is lovely.

962
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:44,006
- Hey. - Just say she's lovely.

963
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:45,876
- Stop that. - Just tell her she's lovely.

964
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:48,746
- Did she just slap me? - Cut it out.

965
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,216
- I'll tell you the rules. - Okay.

966
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,106
- All seven of you will play. - She's good.

967
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:56,276
The last one standing on the first round will rank number one.

968
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:59,106
The last one standing on the second round...

969
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,506
will rank number two.

970
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,676
- I see. - How many pieces can we steal?

971
00:37:04,776 --> 00:37:06,216
The first winner can take five.

972
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:07,876
- I see. - That's a lot.

973
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,306
- The first winner gets five. - The runner-up gets three.

974
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:11,216
- Can I take whichever ones I want? - You can take five pieces.

975
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:12,906
- A House Deed could be in there. - I could take it.

976
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:14,646
- That's great. - The third winner gets one piece.

977
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:17,576
If you lose your House Deed, you instantly become a slave.

978
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:19,776
- If the winner... - Then get ready.

979
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,716
- Get ready. - What?

980
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:22,906
- What? - What?

981
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:27,576
(What kind of a hostess is she?)

982
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:29,376
You have to talk a bit more before we start.

983
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,106
You have to talk more.

984
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,776
You just want to go in because you're cold, right?

985
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,676
In "Section TV", you're supposed to just move on, but...

986
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,006
- we aren't like that. - That's right.

987
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,306
- Right? - Right.

988
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,776
I'm going to turn the table around.

989
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,106
(I'm going to turn the table around.)

990
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,476
(What?)

991
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:44,876
- I'm sorry, but... - Are we in...

992
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,106
- a war right now? - He's scary.

993
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:47,976
This isn't "Nameless Gangster".

994
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,576
- We're just playing hopscotch. - Right.

995
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:52,276
I thought I should give it a shot.

996
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:57,676
(He is prepared to turn it all around.)

997
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,376
Your feet can leave the circle.

998
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,576
But if your bubble leaves the circle, you are out.

999
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:03,846
Get ready.

1000
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:07,646
(The first winner will win five pieces of land.)

1001
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:09,676
Begin.

1002
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,676
(Round one begins.)

1003
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,476
(The members are standing inside the circle.)

1004
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:16,846
Take this.

1005
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,676
(Jong Kook's preemptive strike on Seok Jin)

1006
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:21,776
(Trembling)

1007
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,376
Who was that just now?

1008
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:26,216
(Jong Kook attacks Jae Seok.)

1009
00:38:26,676 --> 00:38:27,846
(Attacking)

1010
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,216
(Jae Seok is out.)

1011
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:33,846
It was Jong Kook again.

1012
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,576
(Seok Jin)

1013
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,906
Is that you, Gary?

1014
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:38,216
(Kwang Soo falls out of the circle.)

1015
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:40,216
Is that you, Gary?

1016
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:42,106
(Lee Kwang Soo is out.)

1017
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:45,276
(Jong Kook attacks Haha.)

1018
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:46,376
Ouch.

1019
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,846
(Jong Kook viciously attacks Gary.)

1020
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:50,876
(Gary is out.)

1021
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:52,216
Get up. There you go.

1022
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:56,906
(Now Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Haha and Ji Hyo are left.)

1023
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:02,376
(After Jong Kook and Haha's attacks, Seok Jin is out.)

1024
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,006
Come on, let's do this right.

1025
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:05,476
How can I possibly win?

1026
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:07,976
Ji Hyo, let's team up.

1027
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:09,276
(He's waiting for the right moment.)

1028
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:11,376
(Jong Kook, Haha and Ji Hyo are left.)

1029
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:12,906
(Jong Kook attacks Ji Hyo.)

1030
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,276
(Haha attacks Jong Kook.)

1031
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:15,676
He might win.

1032
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:17,646
This match is a real toss-up.

1033
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:18,776
(Ji Hyo and Haha fight.)

1034
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:20,906
(Haha is being attacked.)

1035
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,576
Wow.

1036
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:28,106
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

1037
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:29,216
Get up.

1038
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:30,576
(She's lost her mind.)

1039
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:31,676
Goodness.

1040
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,476
- He can't... - Get up.

1041
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:34,776
possibly win.

1042
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,276
- Jong Kook is going to win. - Just get out of there.

1043
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,376
Get up!

1044
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,576
(He sounds very angry.)

1045
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:45,106
- I feel hopeless. - I'm going to lie down for a bit.

1046
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:52,776
- He's eating uncooked ramyun. - I'm going to eat nice, hot steak.

1047
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:56,906
(Haha, it was fun while it lasted, wasn't it?)

1048
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:58,876
I'm going to turn the table around.

1049
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,216
Get up!

1050
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,276
(He sounds very angry.)

1051
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:04,106
Get up.

1052
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:05,576
I'm getting mad.

1053
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,106
Get up.

1054
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:09,106
You know how this is going to end.

1055
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:10,676
Get up.

1056
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,276
- I told you to get up. - Just walk out of there.

1057
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:16,276
Just get out of there.

1058
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:17,676
(Goodbye, landowner.)

1059
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:20,006
(Haha is out.)

1060
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:22,216
Set me down!

1061
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:26,276
(Jong Kook won five pieces of land.)

1062
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:27,576
It's over.

1063
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:31,676
(Jong Kook is now in first place.)

1064
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:33,216
Round two.

1065
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:34,376
Get ready. Begin.

1066
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:36,776
It's better to be at the centre.

1067
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:40,006
(Kwang Soo is going for Seok Jin.)

1068
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:42,376
Hey, hey.

1069
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,276
Not now. Now's not the time.

1070
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,106
(Kwang Soo attacks Seok Jin.)

1071
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,276
Not now.

1072
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:52,376
Ji Hyo, attack him.

1073
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:54,906
(Jae Seok attacks Seok Jin.)

1074
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:56,676
Ji Hyo, attack him.

1075
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,876
(Seok Jin is out.)

1076
00:40:58,006 --> 00:40:59,106
Hey!

1077
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:04,906
Hey, watch out. Watch out over there.

1078
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:08,216
(Haha quickly runs around.)

1079
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,276
Don't come near me.

1080
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:13,906
(Haha and Ji Hyo crash into each other.)

1081
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:16,276
(You dare attack Ji Hyo?)

1082
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:18,306
All right.

1083
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:24,216
(Unable to dodge Gary's attacks, Haha is out.)

1084
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:26,746
(Crashing)

1085
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:27,876
Wait a minute.

1086
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:29,476
Jae Seok is out.

1087
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:31,106
(Jae Seok is out.)

1088
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:32,276
- You're out. - This is...

1089
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:33,376
Maybe Gary or Kwang Soo...

1090
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:35,006
- Gary and Kwang Soo. - Right.

1091
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:37,376
You guys should attack Kwang Soo.

1092
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:39,106
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1093
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:40,876
- Ji Hyo has the most land. - Attack.

1094
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:42,276
Gary, Ji Hyo has the most land.

1095
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:44,106
Gary.

1096
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,876
(Gary has his back towards Kwang Soo.)

1097
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:51,276
(Now is the perfect opportunity.)

1098
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:54,476
- Wow. - Attack him.

1099
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:55,576
Good job.

1100
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:59,646
(Gary is out.)

1101
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:00,776
Ji Hyo, you have to win.

1102
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,106
Go, Ji Hyo.

1103
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,276
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1104
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:06,216
You can't let Kwang Soo win.

1105
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,476
(The winner of this round takes three pieces of land.)

1106
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,576
- Take this. - Ouch.

1107
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:12,106
(Kicking)

1108
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:13,906
- Get up, Ji Hyo. - Ouch.

1109
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:15,876
She's outside her bubble.

1110
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,106
(She trips him.)

1111
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,106
Ji Hyo.

1112
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,876
(Ji Hyo is on a rampage.)

1113
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:28,576
- You... - No, don't do that.

1114
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,276
- Hey. - That's not how you play.

1115
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,476
Ouch. Save me.

1116
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:33,876
Ouch.

1117
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:36,276
(I said, no fooling around!)

1118
00:42:37,106 --> 00:42:38,306
I'm going to run away now.

1119
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,476
Get in. Hurry up.

1120
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:44,746
(He's waiting for...)

1121
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:47,106
(Never mind. He rammed right into her.)

1122
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:48,776
(Falling down)

1123
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:53,106
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1124
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:55,376
- What on earth was that? - Really...

1125
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:56,576
- That was cheap. - Yes!

1126
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:59,006
- What on earth was that? - He really was...

1127
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:00,476
- That was cheap. - Yes.

1128
00:43:00,576 --> 00:43:02,746
- You shouldn't play like that. - That was very cheap.

1129
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:04,776
(Kwang Soo is in second place.)

1130
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:06,476
But this is a very...

1131
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:08,376
- strange situation. - You have a lot of land, right?

1132
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:09,676
(In the third round, only Gary and Ji Hyo are left.)

1133
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:11,376
This is a great showdown.

1134
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:13,746
(The winner will take one piece of land from someone.)

1135
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:14,876
Ji Hyo.

1136
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:16,576
Ji Hyo.

1137
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:18,306
I'm sorry.

1138
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:21,276
She's still not out yet.

1139
00:43:21,776 --> 00:43:25,106
- Ji Hyo always made it to the end. - Right.

1140
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:26,376
(He chose land over love.)

1141
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:27,576
- Ji Hyo. - She's out.

1142
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,006
- She's out. - I'm sorry.

1143
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,276
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1144
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:31,746
- She's out. - I'm sorry.

1145
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:35,746
- Right. - Good job.

1146
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:37,276
- That was manly of you. - Right.

1147
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:38,376
- Good job. - Yes.

1148
00:43:39,106 --> 00:43:42,276
(Jong Kook is first, Kwang Soo is second and Gary is third.)

1149
00:43:42,776 --> 00:43:44,106
I bet you're all nervous.

1150
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:46,476
It's a long shot, but...

1151
00:43:46,906 --> 00:43:49,876
I might be able to claim the kitchen.

1152
00:43:49,906 --> 00:43:52,276
First, I'll take the two pieces that...

1153
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,876
- What? - are next to Seok Jin.

1154
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:56,006
- For now... - On the second floor?

1155
00:43:56,006 --> 00:43:57,576
No, on the first floor. Because...

1156
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,906
when we were talking, Seok Jin...

1157
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,676
said the second floor is worthless.

1158
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:03,276
When I told him that the deeds were on the second floor,

1159
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:05,206
he paused for a moment and then said,

1160
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,876
"Oh, the House Deeds are on the second floor."

1161
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,276
He said that.

1162
00:44:09,276 --> 00:44:10,376
So I think there...

1163
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:12,906
must be a deed hidden somewhere on the first floor.

1164
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:14,276
So, to take his deed...

1165
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,676
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

1166
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:18,106
Why would I hide my deed on the first floor?

1167
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:20,276
- The first floor... - It's on the first floor for sure.

1168
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:22,106
Do you think I would've hidden it there?

1169
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,876
- Well, I think... - Do you...

1170
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:25,646
Why would I hide such an important...

1171
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,276
- thing there? - Yes, on the first floor...

1172
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:28,676
I'm 100 percent sure it's there.

1173
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:30,006
- You... - Do you...

1174
00:44:30,106 --> 00:44:31,476
think I'm that stupid?

1175
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:32,676
- On the second floor... - Hey,

1176
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:34,006
- Kim Jong Kook. - Yes.

1177
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,206
Just go rest in the bedroom on the second floor.

1178
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:38,876
That's just great.

1179
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,906
- Just take the second floor. - No.

1180
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:44,676
I'll take two pieces.

1181
00:44:44,746 --> 00:44:46,106
- On the first floor? - Yes, for now.

1182
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:48,206
- That's just great. - That's just great.

1183
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:50,276
Get out of there.

1184
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:51,376
Get out of there.

1185
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,376
Move, so I can rip it out.

1186
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:54,906
- What are you ripping out? - Your floor piece.

1187
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:56,106
- Put it on top... - Think it over.

1188
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:57,676
- No, that's okay. - Think it over.

1189
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,776
- If his deed is there, it's over. - Right.

1190
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:01,376
Why would I put such an important...

1191
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:03,106
- Yes. - thing on the first floor?

1192
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,106
He sat there for a while.

1193
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,276
Here? Over here?

1194
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:08,376
- It's not on the first floor. - I got it.

1195
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,206
Even if it's not there,

1196
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:12,206
I still get the land.

1197
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,846
I have nowhere to sit now.

1198
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,276
Go to the second floor, then.

1199
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:16,846
- I think it's here. - The second floor.

1200
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:18,576
I'm very curious.

1201
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:20,576
(Seok Jin repeatedly said that it's not here.)

1202
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:21,846
Who would I put it on the first floor?

1203
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,276
Exactly. I...

1204
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,106
(What is the truth?)

1205
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:28,576
(The House Deed)

1206
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,676
(It's really there.)

1207
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,476
- Wow. - Oh, no.

1208
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,006
- Oh, no. - Jong Kook...

1209
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,276
(Jong Kook takes all of Seok Jin's land.)

1210
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:40,376
(Is this really happening?)

1211
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,006
Oh, no. Jong Kook...

1212
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:43,376
took all of it in one try.

1213
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:44,476
Oh, no.

1214
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:45,676
(Jong Kook found it in one try.)

1215
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,776
- He knew exactly where it was. - Wow.

1216
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,476
- Wow. - How did you know?

1217
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,846
My butler

1218
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:53,906
- Wow. - My butler

1219
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:55,576
You can call him either butler...

1220
00:45:55,646 --> 00:45:57,276
of his slave

1221
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:59,206
- Slave, slave - Slave, slave

1222
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:01,476
Unbelievable.

1223
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:03,776
He's amazing.

1224
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:05,676
- How did you know? - He's amazing.

1225
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,676
I was torn between two pieces.

1226
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:08,906
- But I knew it was this one. - The second floor...

1227
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,376
When I said the second floor is...

1228
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:17,476
(Now Jong Kook has six more pieces and 16 in total.)

1229
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,376
- Then... - I think that...

1230
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:21,576
There's still a lot left.

1231
00:46:21,676 --> 00:46:23,576
Because Kwang Soo's territory is small...

1232
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:25,476
- I recommend his... - I have eight pieces.

1233
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:28,306
- That's... - We should take his land.

1234
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:30,106
- Yes, you should take his land. - No.

1235
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:31,376
I know where Jae Seok's deed is.

1236
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:32,846
- Really? - Yes.

1237
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,906
- Where is it? - It's on the second floor.

1238
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:36,876
- It's on the second floor. - Let's go.

1239
00:46:36,906 --> 00:46:38,206
- Should we look upstairs? - Yes.

1240
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:39,476
Let's go.

1241
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:41,206
(Jae Seok doesn't grabs Jong Kook.)

1242
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:42,476
- Wait a minute. - I know where it is.

1243
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:44,276
This is really...

1244
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:45,476
- Wow. - Over here.

1245
00:46:45,746 --> 00:46:47,106
- We should check upstairs. - Yes, we should.

1246
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:48,776
Jae Seok doesn't have a lot of land upstairs.

1247
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:50,206
- Really? - Yes.

1248
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:51,576
This is too much.

1249
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,846
Congratulations in advance.

1250
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,106
- Here it is. - Right.

1251
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,276
The four pieces over here.

1252
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:56,876
- Over here. - I see.

1253
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,776
One, two, three, four, five. It's one of these six pieces.

1254
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:02,576
- If I were Jae Seok... - This is...

1255
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,276
going overboard.

1256
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,476
- He only has six... - If I were him,

1257
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:08,106
- I would put it here. - Wait a minute.

1258
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,906
- Let's gauge his reaction. - Excuse me.

1259
00:47:10,846 --> 00:47:12,676
(He wants to talk with Jong Kook.)

1260
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:13,906
I know where Kwang Soo's deed is.

1261
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:16,276
(He knows where Kwang Soo's deed is.)

1262
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:17,376
- Really? - This way.

1263
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:18,906
Let's go.

1264
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,806
Wait. Wait there.

1265
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:25,746
Forgive me. Forgive me.

1266
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,106
- I know. - Let's not do this to each other.

1267
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:28,776
- What's wrong with you? - I am sorry.

1268
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,106
- Why would you do that? - I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

1269
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:32,576
- Is it on the second floor? - What?

1270
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:33,806
- Is it on the second floor? - Yes.

1271
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:36,376
Kwang Soo's land is over here. You have a good chance here.

1272
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:37,976
- This area and... - There aren't many.

1273
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:40,406
- This area and this area. - You know.

1274
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:41,746
- Yes. Yes. - Kwang Soo.

1275
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:43,006
- There's one here too. - It's not here.

1276
00:47:43,006 --> 00:47:45,006
- There's one here too. - It's not here.

1277
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:46,276
- There's one here. - Yes.

1278
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:48,106
- There's one. - Wait!

1279
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:49,606
A while ago, he said, "It's not here."

1280
00:47:49,676 --> 00:47:53,476
- There's one here too. - It's not here.

1281
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:55,276
- He took a breath and... - I forgot where I put it.

1282
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,006
- then said it's not here. - I forgot where I put it!

1283
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,506
- There's a good chance it's here. - Yes.

1284
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,676
It will be crazy if he gets this one right too.

1285
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:02,376
There's a very good chance that it's here.

1286
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:03,646
- Is that right? - Sir.

1287
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,006
(There is a strong chance that the House Deed is here.)

1288
00:48:05,276 --> 00:48:06,376
So do I rip this piece out?

1289
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:07,706
- No. No. - Why not?

1290
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:09,306
- Please don't. - What?

1291
00:48:09,906 --> 00:48:12,376
This piece is just by itself.

1292
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,476
- Should we give it a go? - Wait. I will do it.

1293
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,746
Don't get your hands dirty, Sir.

1294
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:18,806
Okay.

1295
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,646
I will do the dirty work for you.

1296
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,776
Did you just call his hands dirty?

1297
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:24,476
I think you said he shouldn't touch it with his dirty hands.

1298
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:25,876
(Will his House Deed be here?)

1299
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:27,976
- Are you okay with this? - Let's see what's underneath.

1300
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:31,906
(It is not there!)

1301
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,306
(Kwang Soo got away with his excellent acting!)

1302
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:36,746
- It's too bad. - It's too bad.

1303
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:38,606
Let's go with the green one then.

1304
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:40,376
Since this person gave me the wrong information,

1305
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:41,906
- I will go to his land. - That's right!

1306
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:44,006
You are the best!

1307
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:46,476
This is why people say you are the best!

1308
00:48:46,906 --> 00:48:48,876
Don't be fooled, Sir.

1309
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:51,306
- He's very daring. - His life turned upside-down.

1310
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:52,606
I think...

1311
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:54,876
You disloyal man!

1312
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,406
- Master! - It's your fault.

1313
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:59,876
- In my opinion... - When Jae Seok was entering,

1314
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:01,676
- he kept staring at this spot. - He did?

1315
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,376
(What are you talking about, Sir?)

1316
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,506
He's amazing.

1317
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:12,776
- He kept staring at this area. - It was so obvious.

1318
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:15,276
Seriously.

1319
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,106
- This is crazy. - You are very sharp.

1320
00:49:17,276 --> 00:49:20,276
- You are very sharp. - Isn't this too much?

1321
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,276
He kept looking at this area.

1322
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,306
- He's very sharp. - Jae Seok...

1323
00:49:24,376 --> 00:49:26,776
Look how many people you are taking down after winning once.

1324
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:27,976
You did look at this area...

1325
00:49:27,976 --> 00:49:29,806
- when you were entering. - Let's go.

1326
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,706
- Let's go with this one. - It's so nerve-racking.

1327
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:33,776
We will go with...

1328
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:36,276
- this one first. - It's so nerve-racking.

1329
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:37,576
- I will rip this one out first. - No way.

1330
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:44,776
(Will there be a House Deed underneath this piece?)

1331
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:49,206
This is not it. This is not the one.

1332
00:49:49,276 --> 00:49:50,906
(There is nothing underneath.)

1333
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:53,106
- All right! - How many are there left?

1334
00:49:53,276 --> 00:49:54,276
(Now Jong Kook has only one chance left.)

1335
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:57,376
- Is this the last chance he got? - Then what are you waiting for?

1336
00:49:57,406 --> 00:49:59,276
- I feel bad for Jae Seok. - What do you mean by...

1337
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:00,306
(Jae Seok whispers something to Jong Kook.)

1338
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,876
All right then!

1339
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:03,006
(He's nervous.)

1340
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:04,906
- What do you mean by... - All right then.

1341
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:06,846
- All right! - Consider the probability.

1342
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:08,406
Let's go get the winner's land!

1343
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:10,406
- Yes, let's do that. - I will do that.

1344
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:12,006
(He chooses to take Kwang Soo's land.)

1345
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:14,646
Master.

1346
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:16,006
- Should we go this way? - Master, I think...

1347
00:50:16,006 --> 00:50:18,476
- Should we go this way? - The piece wouldn't be by itself.

1348
00:50:18,506 --> 00:50:20,576
It should be underneath one of these pieces.

1349
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:24,106
I think this corner is useless land.

1350
00:50:24,276 --> 00:50:25,846
- So there's a greater chance. - There's a great chance it's there.

1351
00:50:25,876 --> 00:50:28,106
- I thought that too. - Will you let go of the green land?

1352
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,476
- What? - You don't want the green land?

1353
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:31,876
I think my chances are low with the green land.

1354
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:34,006
- I have a better chance here. - I have many downstairs.

1355
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:38,006
Look. This piece is attached to the floor very neatly.

1356
00:50:38,106 --> 00:50:39,476
- Right? - Which one?

1357
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:40,776
You are right!

1358
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:41,906
Don't block the lighting.

1359
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,106
- Only this one. - It's me.

1360
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:44,776
- Only this one is very clean. - Yes.

1361
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,606
All the other ones are very loosely attached.

1362
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,676
Is it because he's standing here?

1363
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:50,206
He didn't put much effort into sticking others.

1364
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,276
He stuck this one...

1365
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:54,776
- very neatly. - Right.

1366
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,706
- Should we go with this one? - Let's do it!

1367
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:59,276
- Do you want it? - Yes!

1368
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:01,906
- Wait! Listen to me! - Let's do this.

1369
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:03,906
- Listen to what I have to say! - Why?

1370
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:06,006
Why do you keep picking on me?

1371
00:51:06,006 --> 00:51:07,846
- Let's rip it. - Why do you keep picking on me?

1372
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:11,306
- You're a traitor. You're disloyal. - Should we do it?

1373
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:13,106
- Why do you pick on me? - Here we go.

1374
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:14,806
Look!

1375
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:19,376
(Is the House Deed here?)

1376
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:25,476
(House Deed)

1377
00:51:26,906 --> 00:51:28,746
(Kwang Soo is down.)

1378
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:30,906
- Kwang Soo is down! - Really?

1379
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,876
- I told you. - Master! We got him!

1380
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:37,006
It's all because of you!

1381
00:51:37,106 --> 00:51:40,206
It was unusually neat.

1382
00:51:40,276 --> 00:51:42,006
Why did you make that piece so neat?

1383
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:43,376
I'm saved.

1384
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:45,306
- I'm saved. - Why just that one?

1385
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:46,606
- I'm saved. - Why don't we go with the green?

1386
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:50,376
(Jong Kook claims Kwang Soo's land!)

1387
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:54,106
Haha looked at the floor and asked why that piece was so neat.

1388
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:56,206
My master is so good.

1389
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:57,976
(Farewell, my dear land.)

1390
00:51:58,476 --> 00:52:05,276
(Jong Kook now owns 28 floor pieces.)

1391
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:10,706
Are you trying to threaten us or what?

1392
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:13,646
- He suddenly became rich. - Gary is here.

1393
00:52:13,706 --> 00:52:15,806
Don't you have to put this on first?

1394
00:52:15,876 --> 00:52:17,476
- I will put it on. - Wait.

1395
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:19,376
- How many pieces do you own? - What?

1396
00:52:20,606 --> 00:52:21,746
I'm not sure.

1397
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:24,376
A rich person never keeps track of how much he owns.

1398
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:25,746
(He's Jong Kook's pet.)

1399
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:29,476
- You're the master. - Right.

1400
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:31,006
If only I were lucky...

1401
00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:33,106
It's better now to have fellow butlers.

1402
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:37,506
There's an area I've been eyeing on.

1403
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,306
- I kept my eye on this one. - Oh, that one.

1404
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,676
- Yes, that one. - I like this land too.

1405
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:43,806
This land looks nice.

1406
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:45,476
I will tell you this.

1407
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:49,476
On the first floor, I came in after Jae Seok.

1408
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:53,306
The producer said, "Jae Seok, choose where to put your House Deed."

1409
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:56,806
He said, "Okay. Hold on." He went upstairs,

1410
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,376
and then he went outside right after.

1411
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:02,376
- Here you go. - Thank you!

1412
00:53:02,476 --> 00:53:04,846
- Thank you! - Good lad.

1413
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:06,306
- What a good lad. - Thank you.

1414
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,776
- Then I choose... - What is your name, lad?

1415
00:53:08,846 --> 00:53:10,506
- I will choose this. - Oh, Kwang Soo.

1416
00:53:10,906 --> 00:53:14,276
- I will choose this one. - You choose that one?

1417
00:53:14,306 --> 00:53:16,876
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1418
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,906
- I won't forgive you. - That's not it.

1419
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,006
- I won't forgive you. - That's not it.

1420
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:24,876
I don't think that's the one. His acting says it.

1421
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:27,306
- Gosh. - This one has a different colour.

1422
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:30,276
- Master! - Choose this one first.

1423
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:32,576
By the way, this piece is very wrinkled. Look.

1424
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:33,906
Is it wrinkled?

1425
00:53:33,906 --> 00:53:36,006
Look. All the other pieces are very flat. Look.

1426
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:37,776
This one is very wrinkled. Look.

1427
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:39,876
- What happened to this one? - This one is different.

1428
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:42,276
- The colour is different too. - Okay!

1429
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,846
- Its colour is different. - I will do a survey.

1430
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:44,906
Who thinks I should go with this one?

1431
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:46,006
- I do. - I do.

1432
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:47,506
I will go with this one.

1433
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:48,906
Why is this one so wrinkled?

1434
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:51,006
- Look at that one. - You're giving me wrinkles!

1435
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,106
Hey!

1436
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,276
- This is it then. - That's it.

1437
00:53:54,376 --> 00:53:55,906
This must be it!

1438
00:53:56,006 --> 00:54:00,906
(Will there be the House Deed underneath that piece?)

1439
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:08,376
I'm safe!

1440
00:54:08,706 --> 00:54:11,206
- Maybe it was this one. - I'm safe!

1441
00:54:11,276 --> 00:54:13,576
- Maybe it's the one next. - I'm safe.

1442
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:14,706
Try it again later.

1443
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,676
(It's too bad.)

1444
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:18,806
- I'm safe. - Gosh.

1445
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:20,476
- He acts so well. - I won't forgive you, Kwang Soo!

1446
00:54:20,476 --> 00:54:21,846
(Gary failed to obtain Jae Seok's deed.)

1447
00:54:21,846 --> 00:54:23,906
Gary almost got me.

1448
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:26,706
(Gary failed to obtain Jae Seok's deed.)

1449
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:32,876
(Who will be the final winner?)

1450
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:38,776
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin became slaves.)

1451
00:54:39,746 --> 00:54:40,906
(Episode 4: Opportunity Rises after the Crisis, then the Twist)

1452
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:44,106
Gosh.

1453
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:45,276
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo's lands are now Jong Kook's.)

1454
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:47,276
I'm miserable.

1455
00:54:48,476 --> 00:54:49,876
I became miserable.

1456
00:54:49,906 --> 00:54:51,006
It's too bad.

1457
00:54:51,276 --> 00:54:52,876
It was a chance for me to get another fellow butler.

1458
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:55,876
Wait. How do I have so many pieces now?

1459
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:57,906
- You have a lot. - Oh, dear.

1460
00:54:57,906 --> 00:54:59,376
It's all ours, Sir.

1461
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:01,376
Should we go for a walk?

1462
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:02,906
- This is big. - Let's go.

1463
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:06,776
- You could jump to that part. - We can walk around it now.

1464
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,376
Gary almost got me in big trouble.

1465
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:12,506
- Now that there are so much red... - We need to take him down.

1466
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,506
(Right then, the bell rings.)

1467
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,506
We need to take Jae Seok down.

1468
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,276
- Fried chicken! - It just got delivered.

1469
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:20,706
- The chicken is here. - It just got delivered.

1470
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,876
Thank you. Shouldn't you be eating with us?

1471
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,876
- You owe me 10 coins. - Right. 10 coins.

1472
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:28,846
Master, they ordered the fried chicken.

1473
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:30,606
- Please pay her 10 coins. - No, why should I?

1474
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:32,576
- I didn't order it though. - You...

1475
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:33,676
- I didn't order it. - Earlier you said...

1476
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:35,476
- I didn't order it either. - I gave it to you earlier.

1477
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:37,306
I didn't order it, and I don't even eat fried chicken.

1478
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,576
Let's just go ahead and eat it.

1479
00:55:39,806 --> 00:55:42,676
- Thank you. - You have to pay first.

1480
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,476
You have to pay her now.

1481
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:46,906
When will you pay me for the fried chicken?

1482
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:48,106
Hold on, Ji Yeon.

1483
00:55:48,906 --> 00:55:50,006
Give her at least some money.

1484
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:52,806
- Give her two coins. - Bring the chicken here.

1485
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:54,006
- Here you go. - We ordered it together.

1486
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:55,406
- Okay. - I paid her.

1487
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:56,906
Thank you.

1488
00:55:57,006 --> 00:55:58,376
Thank you. You're not eating?

1489
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:00,106
- Please have some. - Have a drumstick.

1490
00:56:00,276 --> 00:56:02,606
- Eat one. - Not the drumstick though.

1491
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:03,776
"Not the drumstick"?

1492
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:06,006
- Why would you say that? - Gosh...

1493
00:56:06,106 --> 00:56:08,706
How could he say that?

1494
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:10,006
How about a wing?

1495
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:11,876
- We will now... - Yes.

1496
00:56:12,406 --> 00:56:14,276
begin the individual floor piece scramble.

1497
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:15,606
- How does it go? - What is this now?

1498
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:17,306
- We have to do this. - Let's do this.

1499
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,746
You will play a game with the one who owns the land you want.

1500
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:22,376
Then decide how many pieces you will bet...

1501
00:56:22,406 --> 00:56:25,906
and which game to play. The game will be one-on-one.

1502
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:28,876
If you win, you will take the land you wanted.

1503
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:31,776
If you lose, the opponent will take your land.

1504
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,906
And if those floor pieces include the House Deed,

1505
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:37,106
- then it's over? - That's right.

1506
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:38,376
(It's a good chance!)

1507
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:41,276
It doesn't matter because if I don't get it this time,

1508
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:42,506
someone else will get it anyway.

1509
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:44,576
- The next person who wins... - All right.

1510
00:56:44,646 --> 00:56:45,706
will take your land for sure.

1511
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:47,376
- It's on the second floor. - Gary.

1512
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:49,676
(Jae Seok is desperate to obtain more floor pieces.)

1513
00:56:49,746 --> 00:56:51,906
(He needs to seize this opportunity.)

1514
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,676
You are allowed to use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1515
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,976
- Really? - Yes. I will play the game...

1516
00:56:57,976 --> 00:56:59,676
for you, and if I win...

1517
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,876
- You will play the game? - Yes.

1518
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,846
If I win, you get double the amount of the floor pieces you first bet.

1519
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:08,746
If I lose, the chance will be gone.

1520
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:10,876
- The chance... - Are you good at playing games?

1521
00:57:10,906 --> 00:57:13,276
Yes. I have nothing to lose anyway.

1522
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,806
That's not what I meant.

1523
00:57:14,876 --> 00:57:17,646
You see, I almost have nothing.

1524
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:19,376
Trying will be too risky.

1525
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:20,846
Trying might put everything to an end.

1526
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:22,306
I think you can trust me on this one.

1527
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,406
- You sure? - What games can you play?

1528
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:25,646
What games do you usually play?

1529
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,306
Well, I play a variety.

1530
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:28,746
Which ones are you good at?

1531
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,006
Speed? Strength?

1532
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,506
- I like speedy games. - Or testing your knowledge?

1533
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:33,006
Oh, I like that too.

1534
00:57:33,006 --> 00:57:34,746
Her knowledge is good too?

1535
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:38,376
- Is that so? - You're given one chance each.

1536
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:40,506
- Lim Ji Yeon Chance. Sounds good. - Hey, this...

1537
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:42,576
is really good.

1538
00:57:42,646 --> 00:57:44,576
You are like a hosting machine.

1539
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,406
You have no emotions whatsoever.

1540
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:48,506
You just host like that.

1541
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:49,746
You are a machine.

1542
00:57:50,006 --> 00:57:51,746
How is it possible to host...

1543
00:57:51,846 --> 00:57:52,906
without any unnecessary comments?

1544
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:54,306
She is very accurate and punctual.

1545
00:57:54,576 --> 00:57:59,006
We will start the game from now on.

1546
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:00,846
What did she just do?

1547
00:58:00,906 --> 00:58:02,646
- She's good. - She is like a machine.

1548
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,476
Very well performed.

1549
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:06,106
Here is the menu book to choose games from.

1550
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:07,206
Okay, thank you.

1551
00:58:07,306 --> 00:58:08,306
Let's have a look at it together.

1552
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:10,306
You guys go...

1553
00:58:10,406 --> 00:58:12,106
and have a look.

1554
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:13,606
(Jae Seok is carefully choosing from the game menu.)

1555
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:15,306
There is the Invisible Chair game.

1556
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:16,906
- Is that so? Right. - Yes.

1557
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:18,506
Nothing looks easy.

1558
00:58:18,576 --> 00:58:20,906
I had a look at it earlier. I think I saw a tickling game.

1559
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:22,106
I will pay Light up the Fire game.

1560
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:23,206
With a plastic bottle,

1561
00:58:23,206 --> 00:58:24,646
- Light up the Fire game. - you have to make it stand to win.

1562
00:58:24,746 --> 00:58:25,746
Sorry?

1563
00:58:26,106 --> 00:58:27,106
(Who will be the opponent?)

1564
00:58:27,576 --> 00:58:28,646
Jae Seok.

1565
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,906
Play the game with me.

1566
00:58:32,106 --> 00:58:34,106
- Will you bet five coins? - You shouldn't gamble.

1567
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,206
Okay, I'll bet five coins.

1568
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:36,306
You have a deal.

1569
00:58:36,406 --> 00:58:37,406
Good.

1570
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:38,506
On top of that, I will...

1571
00:58:40,376 --> 00:58:41,646
use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1572
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,646
- You can ask me to play for you. - Really?

1573
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:48,506
Yes, instead of the player, I will play the game. And if I win,

1574
00:58:48,646 --> 00:58:51,746
you will have the chance to steal twice the amount of land.

1575
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:55,846
(This is the time to bring up the competition.)

1576
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:59,006
I will use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1577
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:00,376
(Laughing)

1578
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:03,406
(Are you being serious?)

1579
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,306
I will use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1580
00:59:05,406 --> 00:59:07,006
- That's good. That's good. - What is that?

1581
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:08,306
(Jingling)

1582
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,106
What's that?

1583
00:59:11,106 --> 00:59:13,206
- What is this Ji Yeon? - So if...

1584
00:59:14,106 --> 00:59:15,646
Jae Seok wins, he can take...

1585
00:59:15,746 --> 00:59:17,106
- 10 pieces from you. - I can take 10 pieces.

1586
00:59:17,506 --> 00:59:19,576
- 10 out of 30. - That is right.

1587
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:20,846
- Let's... - If I win, give me three pieces.

1588
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:22,376
- Haha, let's play. - All right.

1589
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:24,006
Light up the Fire.

1590
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,006
How do we play it?

1591
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:26,006
Like that, you light it up. You know it, Ji Yeon.

1592
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:28,106
(The player chooses 1 lighter out of 5.)

1593
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:31,006
(If the player turns the lighter on in one go, he or she wins.)

1594
00:59:31,746 --> 00:59:34,206
Jae Seok, you are barely...

1595
00:59:34,206 --> 00:59:36,006
hanging off the cliff, aren't you?

1596
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,306
I feel like I should give it to you.

1597
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:39,746
I have to win this game.

1598
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:42,846
(The woman who holds Jae Seok's fate in her hands)

1599
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:45,406
Ji Yeon, you have to win this for me.

1600
00:59:45,606 --> 00:59:46,646
Okay? Good.

1601
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:49,006
Please choose one each.

1602
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:50,646
- You cannot touch it first. - Would you like to go first?

1603
00:59:50,646 --> 00:59:52,006
- Yes, I will choose first. - Okay.

1604
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,376
He's being nice.

1605
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:55,206
- You can choose. - Don't touch it.

1606
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:56,506
Next person.

1607
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:58,846
Don't shake it. Why are you shaking it?

1608
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:00,846
Wait a minute, why are you shaking it?

1609
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:02,906
(She is very motivated to win.)

1610
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:05,406
Choose one.

1611
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:08,106
- You can't choose it again. - Okay, that is fine.

1612
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,306
On three, both of you face forward and go.

1613
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:13,106
You thought you were doing it with the same one, right?

1614
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:14,906
One.

1615
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:16,906
Remember, it's in one go.

1616
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:18,006
(Concentrated)

1617
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:20,206
On the count of three...

1618
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:21,646
Can you please be careful with your breath.

1619
01:00:22,406 --> 01:00:23,846
Don't let out a sigh.

1620
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:25,376
- It's at the same time? - Yes, it is.

1621
01:00:25,506 --> 01:00:27,106
Ji Yeon, make sure you keep it pressed.

1622
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,206
One.

1623
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:29,306
(We're ready.)

1624
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,846
- One. - Let's end it here.

1625
01:00:30,846 --> 01:00:31,846
(One)

1626
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:32,846
Two.

1627
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:34,746
(Two)

1628
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:35,846
Three.

1629
01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:36,906
(Three)

1630
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:38,206
If it doesn't work this time,

1631
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:39,646
it definitely will in the next round.

1632
01:00:40,206 --> 01:00:43,106
- If that's what you say... - It will end in the next round.

1633
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,206
One.

1634
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:45,646
Two.

1635
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:46,746
Three.

1636
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,846
(What?)

1637
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,376
(Ji Yeon lost.)

1638
01:00:51,406 --> 01:00:54,746
(Haha succeeded.)

1639
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:57,846
(I am done for.)

1640
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:03,006
(What should I do?)

1641
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:06,406
Haha. Haha.

1642
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:09,406
(Jae Seok lost. Haha won.)

1643
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:10,746
Congratulations, Sir.

1644
01:01:11,746 --> 01:01:15,106
Let's see if I can get a butler as well now.

1645
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,606
(Poor Ji Yeon)

1646
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,746
- Which one was it? - Was it this one?

1647
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:20,646
It works.

1648
01:01:20,646 --> 01:01:22,006
This one.

1649
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:24,106
They all work.

1650
01:01:25,406 --> 01:01:27,706
Ji Yeon has no skills with her hands.

1651
01:01:28,846 --> 01:01:30,006
I thought she'd be good.

1652
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:31,106
She can do it well.

1653
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:34,306
- She's good. - She is good now.

1654
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:35,846
What's the point of being good now?

1655
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:39,406
- She was nervous. - What is the point of doing it now?

1656
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,406
It's okay. It happens when you get nervous.

1657
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,376
Right, Jae Seok. Take this and follow me.

1658
01:01:43,406 --> 01:01:44,906
- Let me follow you too. - Let's go.

1659
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:46,846
(By winning this game, Haha acquires five more pieces.)

1660
01:01:46,846 --> 01:01:48,376
I get to have a very good tour.

1661
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:50,206
Kwang Soo.

1662
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,646
This is fun.

1663
01:01:51,646 --> 01:01:53,206
I am here to see some land.

1664
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:57,576
- This is his territory. - There is not a lot.

1665
01:01:57,706 --> 01:01:59,206
(This is where it is.)

1666
01:01:59,206 --> 01:02:01,106
(Jae Seok's getting nervous.)

1667
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:02,206
We will take it apart now.

1668
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:04,306
You can open it, but it may not be here.

1669
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:06,406
Gary really wanted to take this land here.

1670
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:09,846
Let's just have a look for fun.

1671
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:12,646
There is a piece I want to take.

1672
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,746
- Where is it? - That's the one.

1673
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:16,206
I kind of wanted this.

1674
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:17,576
I like that land too.

1675
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:19,006
This one and then...

1676
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,606
The floor is very wrinkled here.

1677
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,106
Is it wrinkled?

1678
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,206
Look here, it's all wrinkly.

1679
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:26,576
We will go with this.

1680
01:02:26,906 --> 01:02:28,306
Why is this so wrinkled?

1681
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:29,576
- This must be it. - We found it.

1682
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:31,846
This must be it.

1683
01:02:31,906 --> 01:02:33,006
(They chose the piece according to Jong Kook's advice.)

1684
01:02:33,106 --> 01:02:34,106
(But it failed.)

1685
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:35,306
I'm all right for now.

1686
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:37,006
It must have been this, not that.

1687
01:02:37,106 --> 01:02:38,206
I'm all good.

1688
01:02:38,576 --> 01:02:39,906
(Jae Seok was saved thanks to Jong Kook.)

1689
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:41,846
Let's go for this one, next.

1690
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:44,206
(This is the piece which made everyone suspicious.)

1691
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:45,576
Let's go for this one, first.

1692
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:47,006
Shall we?

1693
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:49,476
Okay. I will take it off.

1694
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:52,006
(Looking uneasy)

1695
01:02:52,106 --> 01:02:53,106
Here we go.

1696
01:02:53,506 --> 01:02:55,746
If I am right, it will be so unfair.

1697
01:02:55,846 --> 01:03:01,906
(Will there be Jae Seok's House Deed under here?)

1698
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:04,406
Goodness, it is there.

1699
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:05,906
(House Deed is found.)

1700
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:07,576
Congratulations, Haha.

1701
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:09,606
(They got me.)

1702
01:03:09,646 --> 01:03:11,506
(Haha the Rich Landowner)

1703
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:12,646
Haha.

1704
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,406
Goodness.

1705
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:17,106
He could have been my butler.

1706
01:03:17,306 --> 01:03:18,906
I was the next in the queue.

1707
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:21,406
It's all because of Kwang Soo.

1708
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,846
Congratulations, Sir.

1709
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,306
(Haha has overtaken Jae Seok's land.)

1710
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:30,646
(Jae Seok's territory now belongs to Haha.)

1711
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:40,606
(Episode 5: The Lucky Lady)

1712
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:45,006
She's here again.

1713
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:47,746
Can all the heirs step out to the front, please?

1714
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:49,846
- Yes. - We have all been called out.

1715
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:53,006
What is this?

1716
01:03:55,606 --> 01:03:56,646
(Which game is it this time?)

1717
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:57,746
Step out here please.

1718
01:03:57,846 --> 01:04:00,006
It's like king of the hill.

1719
01:04:00,106 --> 01:04:02,106
I think it's a game similar to that sand castle thing.

1720
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:04,576
If you weren't confident, you should have let me know in advance.

1721
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:06,646
He holds grudges.

1722
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:08,846
He does have grudges.

1723
01:04:08,906 --> 01:04:11,006
I thought Ji Yeon would...

1724
01:04:12,206 --> 01:04:13,846
- Sir, you are here. - Sir.

1725
01:04:13,846 --> 01:04:15,106
Yes.

1726
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:17,006
He answered like a kid.

1727
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:19,906
- He is a funny guy. - Sir.

1728
01:04:20,576 --> 01:04:23,206
(I am your master.)

1729
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:26,646
- You make us laugh sometimes. - I wasn't answering you.

1730
01:04:27,206 --> 01:04:28,846
- I was talking to my butler. - Okay, Sir.

1731
01:04:29,476 --> 01:04:31,306
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

1732
01:04:31,406 --> 01:04:33,646
The game we are going to play now is called...

1733
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:35,506
Wobbly Stick game.

1734
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:36,906
- Wobbly Stick game. - Wobbly Stick game.

1735
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,606
That sounds fun.

1736
01:04:38,846 --> 01:04:40,846
After you choose the the order of playing the game,

1737
01:04:40,906 --> 01:04:43,206
- you will pick the sticks in turn. - Okay.

1738
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:44,846
When the stick is pulled out,

1739
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,706
if the balls fall to the ground,

1740
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:48,906
they will be your negative points.

1741
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:50,646
You really sound like a machine.

1742
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,606
After all the sticks have been pulled out,

1743
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:55,206
the number of balls dropped by each person will be counted...

1744
01:04:55,406 --> 01:04:59,006
and you will be ranked in order of smallest points.

1745
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:01,646
During this game, you can use your slave.

1746
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:05,506
If you are not confident about playing this game,

1747
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:07,206
you can make your slave work instead of you.

1748
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:09,746
It sounds better than the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1749
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:11,206
The Lim Ji Yeon Chance still exists in this game.

1750
01:05:11,306 --> 01:05:12,646
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1751
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:14,746
- I can use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance. - How does the slave chance work?

1752
01:05:14,746 --> 01:05:17,746
If you let your slave play and if your slave wins,

1753
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:20,206
10 R-Money will be given as winning prize.

1754
01:05:20,646 --> 01:05:21,746
It will be given to the slave.

1755
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:23,006
Master, please.

1756
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,106
Let me do it, please.

1757
01:05:24,106 --> 01:05:26,006
- Master, please send me. - Give me a chance, please.

1758
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,576
Master, I will be your dog.

1759
01:05:28,006 --> 01:05:31,106
- Master, I will be your chicken. - Woof, woof.

1760
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:33,106
See how loyal they are to me.

1761
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:34,846
Will you be able to see me on Saturday?

1762
01:05:35,906 --> 01:05:37,576
Is that a threat?

1763
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:39,606
- You can't do that. - That's not very nice.

1764
01:05:39,646 --> 01:05:40,646
Why did you bring up the Saturday show?

1765
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:42,206
What did I say about Saturday?

1766
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:43,646
No, I mean on Saturday...

1767
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:45,206
I think you are mistaken.

1768
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:46,746
- We planned to meet on Saturday. - I don't think that is right.

1769
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:48,746
We have a family meal planned together, isn't that so?

1770
01:05:48,846 --> 01:05:51,576
- Right? - Yes, of course.

1771
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:53,206
I will use the Lim Ji Yeon Chance.

1772
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:55,846
Wait, is it not only because you like her?

1773
01:05:56,306 --> 01:05:57,506
That's another reason.

1774
01:05:58,506 --> 01:06:00,406
He really falls in love quite easily these days, right?

1775
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:01,506
Yes.

1776
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:03,306
Lim Ji Yeon, Go.

1777
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:04,406
Go.

1778
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,476
- I will use my slave, Seok Jin. - Thank you.

1779
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:09,306
That's why you need to be nice to people all the time.

1780
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,006
You really need to do well on this. Don't mess it up.

1781
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:14,106
Yes, I understand.

1782
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:17,976
(Order: Seok Jin, Ji Yeon, Ji Hyo, Haha)

1783
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:19,846
The one on the top looks safe.

1784
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:21,506
Aren't these...

1785
01:06:21,606 --> 01:06:22,846
the safer ones to go for?

1786
01:06:22,906 --> 01:06:23,906
But you should take the ones from the top...

1787
01:06:24,006 --> 01:06:27,206
If you take the bottom ones, the balls will start falling,

1788
01:06:27,206 --> 01:06:29,606
- That's when the problem starts. - I'm not too sure about this.

1789
01:06:29,646 --> 01:06:30,846
- It doesn't matter, next time... - Just do it.

1790
01:06:30,906 --> 01:06:32,646
- Do it quickly, come on. - There are so many.

1791
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:34,746
It's okay, because there are a lot more at the bottom.

1792
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:36,506
Do what you want. Don't feel pressured at all.

1793
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,506
(Next up is Ji Yeon in Gary's place.)

1794
01:06:39,846 --> 01:06:41,646
You have to take the bottom ones first so the next person...

1795
01:06:41,646 --> 01:06:43,406
- will end up dropping the balls. - I will go next now.

1796
01:06:43,506 --> 01:06:44,506
Okay.

1797
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:46,606
You have to take out a lot in the beginning.

1798
01:06:46,646 --> 01:06:48,846
Just do it with confidence.

1799
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:50,906
- It made holes. - These will let the balls through.

1800
01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:52,206
I like the calm approach there.

1801
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,376
Is it my turn?

1802
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:54,646
Your turn comes back quite quickly.

1803
01:06:54,746 --> 01:06:55,846
- Oh no. - Oh no.

1804
01:06:56,006 --> 01:06:57,006
Your turn comes back quite quickly.

1805
01:06:57,106 --> 01:06:58,206
(A little movement)

1806
01:06:59,006 --> 01:07:00,476
Your turn comes back quite quickly.

1807
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,006
(Dropping)

1808
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:03,846
- One has dropped now. - One ball dropped.

1809
01:07:03,906 --> 01:07:05,846
You have to take that one out. You have no choice.

1810
01:07:06,206 --> 01:07:08,406
(The warm-up is over.)

1811
01:07:08,476 --> 01:07:10,476
(Careful)

1812
01:07:11,206 --> 01:07:12,746
She managed.

1813
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:16,306
(The balls are gradually falling as the sticks are pulled out.)

1814
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:18,446
Why don't you take it out?

1815
01:07:19,846 --> 01:07:21,406
Just keep out of it and be quiet.

1816
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:23,406
Yes, Sir.

1817
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:26,506
There. That's good.

1818
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:28,006
- Like this. - Good job.

1819
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:30,906
(That is perfect.)

1820
01:07:30,906 --> 01:07:32,306
- That was good. - It's empty here.

1821
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:33,406
- There's more. - Ji Yeon,

1822
01:07:33,506 --> 01:07:35,306
you're doing great with Gary.

1823
01:07:35,846 --> 01:07:37,806
Hey, Ji Yeon.

1824
01:07:38,106 --> 01:07:39,206
- You are so focused. - Really.

1825
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:40,846
It would have been great...

1826
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:42,506
if you played like this before.

1827
01:07:42,906 --> 01:07:44,646
- Don't hold grudges. - Come on.

1828
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:47,006
It's dangerous now.

1829
01:07:47,306 --> 01:07:48,406
I have to get this.

1830
01:07:48,506 --> 01:07:50,006
(It's Ji Hyo's turn again.)

1831
01:07:50,906 --> 01:07:52,006
There are a lot there.

1832
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:53,406
- Oh, no. - That's good.

1833
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:56,806
(Several balls fall.)

1834
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,406
- That's great. - It's a party.

1835
01:07:58,406 --> 01:07:59,646
Congratulations.

1836
01:07:59,706 --> 01:08:00,846
It's a party.

1837
01:08:01,846 --> 01:08:03,506
- Was it 6? - 6 balls.

1838
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:04,746
(Falling)

1839
01:08:04,746 --> 01:08:05,746
- Wow. - That's a lot.

1840
01:08:05,846 --> 01:08:07,106
- That's a lot. - Oh, no.

1841
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:08,506
- Oh, no. - Oh, goodness.

1842
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:09,806
I think you've chosen the wrong one,

1843
01:08:09,846 --> 01:08:11,106
- Ma'am. - That was wrong.

1844
01:08:11,206 --> 01:08:13,846
I picked this one on purpose.

1845
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:15,306
- It's okay. - It's fine.

1846
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:17,706
Let's pick these up.

1847
01:08:17,746 --> 01:08:19,306
Keep up the good work.

1848
01:08:19,406 --> 01:08:21,016
- Thank you, Sir. - There are two more.

1849
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,846
- It's my pleasure. - Sure.

1850
01:08:23,906 --> 01:08:25,516
Here. Here.

1851
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:27,306
Ouch.

1852
01:08:27,706 --> 01:08:28,706
(What was that?)

1853
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,516
Give it to me. Where did that come from?

1854
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,846
- What are you doing? - The ball just flew.

1855
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:34,906
- How could you? - It wasn't me.

1856
01:08:35,206 --> 01:08:36,846
- You're mistaken. - Okay.

1857
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:38,606
- It's stuck. - Shall I pick this?

1858
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,406
- Will this fall? - Just lose that one.

1859
01:08:41,206 --> 01:08:42,906
I'll have to try this side.

1860
01:08:47,016 --> 01:08:48,106
That one is caught.

1861
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:50,016
You never know what'll happen.

1862
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,106
- Oh, no! - Oh, my goodness!

1863
01:08:52,406 --> 01:08:53,846
(Balls are falling.)

1864
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:56,306
- It's a party! - Why did you pull that one?

1865
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:58,206
- Congratulations - Congratulations

1866
01:08:58,206 --> 01:09:00,406
- Congratulations - It was the wrong one.

1867
01:09:00,406 --> 01:09:03,016
You will have to pick these up.

1868
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,206
- Good job! - Nice.

1869
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:06,646
- Great job. - That wasn't bad.

1870
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:08,016
- Here. - Take these.

1871
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,106
(There are plenty of balls.)

1872
01:09:09,106 --> 01:09:10,906
We have lots of balls now.

1873
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,306
(There are plenty of balls.)

1874
01:09:13,846 --> 01:09:15,106
(She's being careful.)

1875
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:16,746
- That was okay. - I was doing well.

1876
01:09:16,846 --> 01:09:18,306
- We're on the same boat. - It didn't feel right.

1877
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:20,106
- Wow. - That's great.

1878
01:09:20,106 --> 01:09:21,606
- She is good. - She is good.

1879
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:22,846
- Good job. - Okay.

1880
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:24,516
- Ji Yeon's good. - Wow.

1881
01:09:24,646 --> 01:09:25,906
- Wow. - You're good.

1882
01:09:26,016 --> 01:09:27,016
She's good.

1883
01:09:27,016 --> 01:09:28,206
- She only dropped one ball. - That's great.

1884
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,306
She's really good at it.

1885
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:31,306
She's good.

1886
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:32,516
She's really great.

1887
01:09:32,606 --> 01:09:33,746
- She's good. - I can't forget...

1888
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:35,646
- about the lighter. - She's so good at this game.

1889
01:09:35,746 --> 01:09:36,806
(Jae Seok holds a grudge against Ji Yeon.)

1890
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:38,206
It turns out she's really good at this game.

1891
01:09:39,206 --> 01:09:42,016
- Haha. - There's one right here.

1892
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,206
- This one's a good one. - No, it's not!

1893
01:09:44,406 --> 01:09:45,516
- Oh, no. - That's not it.

1894
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:48,106
(Haha makes balls fall again.)

1895
01:09:48,206 --> 01:09:50,016
- That was the wrong one! - Oh, no.

1896
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:51,516
- That wasn't it. - More balls.

1897
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:52,646
I'm sorry!

1898
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,206
Oh, well...

1899
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:55,406
(I was too excited.)

1900
01:09:55,516 --> 01:09:57,516
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Sir.

1901
01:09:57,606 --> 01:09:58,906
Look carefully.

1902
01:09:59,646 --> 01:10:01,016
(It's Ji Yeon's turn again.)

1903
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:02,016
Nothing is a safe bet.

1904
01:10:02,106 --> 01:10:03,906
Gary chose really well.

1905
01:10:04,206 --> 01:10:05,306
- I should've asked for Ji Yeon, - Pick carefully.

1906
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:07,016
Excuse me, are you two shopping?

1907
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:08,906
- Right? - I got it.

1908
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:09,906
- This one. - Let's go.

1909
01:10:10,016 --> 01:10:11,206
One, two, three.

1910
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:12,516
- Pull it out. - Okay.

1911
01:10:12,846 --> 01:10:14,516
- Pull it out. - Fall, fall!

1912
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:15,746
(She is very careful.)

1913
01:10:16,706 --> 01:10:18,016
- What? - That's amazing.

1914
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:19,516
- How? - Why aren't they falling?

1915
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:20,746
Nice.

1916
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:22,016
(She's ecstatic.)

1917
01:10:22,106 --> 01:10:24,206
(Nice!)

1918
01:10:24,206 --> 01:10:25,406
- That's nice. - Wow!

1919
01:10:25,406 --> 01:10:26,516
- Yes! - I can't believe it.

1920
01:10:26,646 --> 01:10:27,706
- Yes! - Wow!

1921
01:10:27,746 --> 01:10:28,846
I can't believe it.

1922
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:30,306
- That was awesome. - What was that?

1923
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:32,606
- What did she say? - That was so tacky.

1924
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,016
- She said, "Nice". - She said it in a tacky way.

1925
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,206
"Nice".

1926
01:10:36,906 --> 01:10:39,106
(Again, it's Ji Yeon's turn.)

1927
01:10:39,106 --> 01:10:40,846
They are so good.

1928
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:42,016
They are too good.

1929
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:43,206
(They are so good. They are too good.)

1930
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:44,646
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1931
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:47,516
- Take this. - You touched it.

1932
01:10:48,016 --> 01:10:49,606
- Are you a couple? - You're too close.

1933
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:51,016
- They look good together. - It won't work.

1934
01:10:51,016 --> 01:10:52,306
- Oh, man. - Ji Hyo is...

1935
01:10:52,406 --> 01:10:54,606
watching you, Gary.

1936
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:56,406
Isn't she all in the past?

1937
01:10:57,406 --> 01:10:58,646
(What?)

1938
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:02,406
- I moved on. - Ji Hyo.

1939
01:11:02,646 --> 01:11:04,206
- Ji Hyo, it's okay. - Don't be upset.

1940
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:05,516
- Ji Hyo. - It's all right.

1941
01:11:05,646 --> 01:11:06,646
He's not worth your time.

1942
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:07,976
(Ji Yeon is focused on playing the game.)

1943
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,016
- It's okay. - Just let that one fall.

1944
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:11,406
- It's okay. It's just one ball. - Yes.

1945
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:12,746
- Just three. - It's okay.

1946
01:11:12,806 --> 01:11:13,846
- They keep falling. - It's okay.

1947
01:11:13,906 --> 01:11:15,406
- Gary. - You shouldn't...

1948
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:16,846
- pull it out slowly. - That's right.

1949
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:18,406
- Just pull it. - Pull it out quickly.

1950
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:19,846
- That's okay. - Don't worry.

1951
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:21,206
- Great. - That's good.

1952
01:11:21,306 --> 01:11:22,746
You'll still win.

1953
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,016
- It's okay. - You'll win anyway.

1954
01:11:25,016 --> 01:11:27,206
Now it all depends on the timing.

1955
01:11:28,106 --> 01:11:29,306
- Okay. - Next.

1956
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:31,106
(Haha pulls one out swiftly.)

1957
01:11:31,206 --> 01:11:32,406
Don't do it like that.

1958
01:11:33,646 --> 01:11:34,806
I told you not to do that.

1959
01:11:34,846 --> 01:11:36,206
He doesn't know how to play.

1960
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:37,746
I'll get sold again.

1961
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:39,016
(I'll get sold again.)

1962
01:11:39,106 --> 01:11:40,106
- I'll get sold again. - Hey!

1963
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:41,646
What did you just call me?

1964
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:43,206
At this rate,

1965
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,016
- I'll get sold again. - I can't do this.

1966
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:46,516
- I'm so frustrated. - What?

1967
01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:48,206
- Calm down. - I'm not good at this game.

1968
01:11:48,306 --> 01:11:50,846
I can't stand playing a game like this.

1969
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,106
- If Gary wins... - If Gary wins...

1970
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:55,106
- The other team is in trouble. - Right.

1971
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:57,016
You can consider me as a slave.

1972
01:11:57,106 --> 01:11:58,306
- You'll be a slave. - Yes.

1973
01:11:58,306 --> 01:12:00,016
- Right. - Poor you.

1974
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:01,516
Nobody lives forever.

1975
01:12:02,206 --> 01:12:04,846
- You'll get sold again. - Really.

1976
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:06,206
I don't want to be sold again.

1977
01:12:07,016 --> 01:12:08,706
I really don't.

1978
01:12:09,016 --> 01:12:10,206
- Let's tidy up. - I have three.

1979
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:12,516
- I'll throw away six. - Okay.

1980
01:12:12,606 --> 01:12:14,016
Gary wins the game anyway.

1981
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:16,016
- Great. - That's it.

1982
01:12:16,106 --> 01:12:17,206
- Next. - Who's next?

1983
01:12:17,746 --> 01:12:18,906
(Swiftly)

1984
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:20,206
(It's finished.)

1985
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:21,406
Come on.

1986
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,516
I told you not to do that.

1987
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:27,646
(The game is over.)

1988
01:12:27,746 --> 01:12:29,016
- I can't believe this. - Come on.

1989
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,206
- I'm the last one. - I know.

1990
01:12:30,306 --> 01:12:31,406
- Gary. - Okay.

1991
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:32,906
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4. - Tidy up.

1992
01:12:32,906 --> 01:12:34,306
- First one. - First place...

1993
01:12:34,306 --> 01:12:36,106
Ji Yeon, you were great.

1994
01:12:36,906 --> 01:12:39,016
Gary gets 10 pieces thanks to Ji Yeon.

1995
01:12:39,406 --> 01:12:41,106
- We're second. - Yes, we are second.

1996
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:44,306
Here you go.

1997
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:46,016
- Yes. - That's a lot.

1998
01:12:46,106 --> 01:12:47,606
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1999
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:49,306
Thank you.

2000
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,016
Gary was lucky to have Ji Yeon.

2001
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:52,016
- He was. - Really.

2002
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,646
- Second place. - I'll take it.

2003
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,206
- Thank you. - We don't need that.

2004
01:12:55,646 --> 01:12:56,906
- Take it. - Gary.

2005
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,306
Where are you going? I'll carry it for you.

2006
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:00,306
- I'll carry it. - I'm not the heir yet.

2007
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:03,016
- Don't do this. - Come on.

2008
01:13:03,016 --> 01:13:04,206
- What are you doing? - Pardon?

2009
01:13:04,306 --> 01:13:06,406
- What are you doing? - Master.

2010
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:08,646
- Let's go. - What are you doing?

2011
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,846
Master Gary, Master Gary.

2012
01:13:11,306 --> 01:13:12,406
(Gary was lucky.)

2013
01:13:12,746 --> 01:13:14,206
Where are you going, Sir?

2014
01:13:14,206 --> 01:13:15,206
(Gary was lucky.)

2015
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:16,846
I'll carry that for you.

2016
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:18,906
(Later)

2017
01:13:19,206 --> 01:13:22,516
(The game isn't not over yet.)

2018
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:26,206
(There's an unexpected ending.)

2019
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:28,516
(It starts now.)

2020
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:30,906
Everyone, gather around.

2021
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:32,516
(Last Episode: The Grand Finale)

2022
01:13:32,846 --> 01:13:34,746
Seriously, you know what?

2023
01:13:34,846 --> 01:13:35,906
(It's time for Gary to take over the land.)

2024
01:13:36,016 --> 01:13:38,016
Gary now has 10 chances.

2025
01:13:38,806 --> 01:13:40,306
And he has 11 pieces.

2026
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:41,406
(Jong Kook has 11 pieces.)

2027
01:13:41,406 --> 01:13:42,706
- Am I right? - That's right.

2028
01:13:42,746 --> 01:13:45,846
- If Gary can't find it, - It wouldn't make sense.

2029
01:13:45,906 --> 01:13:46,906
it wouldn't make sense.

2030
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:48,746
- I can. - If Gary takes...

2031
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:49,906
Jong Kook's...

2032
01:13:50,016 --> 01:13:51,606
- Then Gary can win. - That's right.

2033
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:53,206
- Gary's situation is better. - Jong Kook's in trouble.

2034
01:13:53,306 --> 01:13:54,406
- There's a possibility. - Yes.

2035
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:55,906
It's up to Gary.

2036
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,646
If Gary tries to...

2037
01:13:57,976 --> 01:13:59,306
take mine...

2038
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,606
- What do you mean? - What?

2039
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,206
If Gary...

2040
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,746
finds my deed early,

2041
01:14:06,846 --> 01:14:08,206
he might find...

2042
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:09,406
- other people's deeds too. - Right.

2043
01:14:09,516 --> 01:14:10,516
Wait a minute.

2044
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,746
- Let's start. - Okay.

2045
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:13,846
- Let's start. - All right.

2046
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:15,206
- Okay. - Where should we go?

2047
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,406
- That way. - All right.

2048
01:14:16,516 --> 01:14:17,606
Master Gary.

2049
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:19,406
We're moving to Jong Kook's area.

2050
01:14:19,516 --> 01:14:20,746
- Okay. - Yes.

2051
01:14:22,306 --> 01:14:23,646
I'll take this side.

2052
01:14:23,746 --> 01:14:24,906
(Jong Kook settled next to the kitchen.)

2053
01:14:25,016 --> 01:14:27,646
It's great except for the open windows.

2054
01:14:28,906 --> 01:14:32,016
(He kept his spot even though cold wind blew in.)

2055
01:14:32,016 --> 01:14:33,306
- This way. - Yes.

2056
01:14:33,406 --> 01:14:35,206
- Let's check it out. - Okay.

2057
01:14:35,746 --> 01:14:38,306
- I'll move the chairs. - Let me check this out.

2058
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:40,746
- Sir. - The red one.

2059
01:14:41,406 --> 01:14:43,406
This land looks good.

2060
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:44,746
Yes, if I were him,

2061
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:46,746
- I'd go with this too. - Yes.

2062
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,206
- Where? - Here.

2063
01:14:48,846 --> 01:14:50,206
I have no regrets.

2064
01:14:50,206 --> 01:14:51,906
- I really don't. - This?

2065
01:14:52,016 --> 01:14:53,646
- Let's flip it. - Okay.

2066
01:14:53,806 --> 01:14:55,016
- Is it this one? - Yes.

2067
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:56,206
Yes, I'll flip it.

2068
01:14:56,306 --> 01:14:57,706
- I choose this one first. - Okay.

2069
01:14:58,206 --> 01:14:59,646
- Look. - Let's do it.

2070
01:14:59,706 --> 01:15:01,016
- Here I go. - Here it is.

2071
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:02,906
You guys are in danger too.

2072
01:15:02,906 --> 01:15:04,606
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2073
01:15:05,406 --> 01:15:12,206
(Will there be a House Deed?)

2074
01:15:12,276 --> 01:15:14,016
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

2075
01:15:14,206 --> 01:15:16,206
(It's not there.)

2076
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:17,706
- No. - Oh, no.

2077
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,106
- He's a tough opponent. - Right.

2078
01:15:20,106 --> 01:15:21,306
He's not easy to beat.

2079
01:15:21,306 --> 01:15:23,206
Well. Okay, then.

2080
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:24,746
How about this one?

2081
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:27,306
This is amazing.

2082
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:30,646
What if I can't find it in 10 tries?

2083
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:32,406
One, two, three.

2084
01:15:32,516 --> 01:15:33,646
(Gary's second choice)

2085
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,846
(What's underneath it?)

2086
01:15:36,906 --> 01:15:37,976
Look at this.

2087
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:39,206
What did I tell you?

2088
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,516
Let's keep going.

2089
01:15:40,646 --> 01:15:42,016
- I'll keep going. - Keep going.

2090
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:43,106
- You must keep going. - You can do it.

2091
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,206
- This is your third try. - You have no other choice.

2092
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:47,016
One, two, three.

2093
01:15:47,106 --> 01:15:53,406
(Gary failed twice in a row. What about his third try?)

2094
01:15:53,406 --> 01:15:55,516
One, two, three.

2095
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:56,516
Oh, no!

2096
01:15:56,606 --> 01:15:57,706
(It's also nothing.)

2097
01:15:57,746 --> 01:15:59,306
- This is not it. - Wrong spot.

2098
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:00,406
Sir, it's not in here.

2099
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:01,906
- No? - This isn't it.

2100
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:03,806
- Let's go upstairs. - Won't you try this?

2101
01:16:04,016 --> 01:16:05,206
I'll try it later.

2102
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:06,806
You have to concentrate.

2103
01:16:06,906 --> 01:16:08,106
Where's the original spot?

2104
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:10,806
Choose carefully. You can't afford any more mistakes.

2105
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,706
- Gary. Here... - You can't try that.

2106
01:16:12,746 --> 01:16:14,106
- This isn't it. - No, it isn't.

2107
01:16:14,106 --> 01:16:15,306
- This isn't it. - I know.

2108
01:16:15,306 --> 01:16:16,406
I might...

2109
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:17,976
(Everyone moves upstairs.)

2110
01:16:18,516 --> 01:16:19,846
- choose the wrong one again. - You might.

2111
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:21,306
Master Gary, come this way.

2112
01:16:21,516 --> 01:16:23,516
Earlier, I definitely saw Jong Kook...

2113
01:16:24,206 --> 01:16:25,206
enter this room.

2114
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:27,306
- I wrote his name here. - I can't...

2115
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:28,906
- believe Kwang Soo. - I wrote it.

2116
01:16:28,906 --> 01:16:30,206
- He's something. - Look.

2117
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:32,206
- It's my handwriting. - I can't believe him.

2118
01:16:32,516 --> 01:16:33,906
- This is it! - Yes.

2119
01:16:33,906 --> 01:16:35,406
- This! - This is my handwriting.

2120
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:37,516
- Try this. - This is it.

2121
01:16:37,646 --> 01:16:38,806
This...

2122
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:41,106
- was almost useless land. - I think...

2123
01:16:41,106 --> 01:16:42,406
it's about time.

2124
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:44,106
- It's your fourth try. - Yes.

2125
01:16:44,306 --> 01:16:46,016
- Please. - Try it.

2126
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:47,976
- Please, let this not be it. - I will rip it.

2127
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:49,706
- Please, let this not be it. - I will rip it.

2128
01:16:50,016 --> 01:16:51,206
One, two, three!

2129
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,606
(Kwang Soo recommended this spot.)

2130
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:53,706
(Will there be a House Deed?)

2131
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:55,406
I have 11 pieces.

2132
01:16:55,516 --> 01:16:56,846
You never know what will happen.

2133
01:16:56,906 --> 01:16:59,516
(Will there be Jong Kook's House Deed?)

2134
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:01,406
- Yes! - Yes!

2135
01:17:02,806 --> 01:17:04,746
(They found Jong Kook's House Deed.)

2136
01:17:04,846 --> 01:17:07,106
(I did it!)

2137
01:17:07,846 --> 01:17:09,206
(He found it on his fourth try.)

2138
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:11,206
Congratulations!

2139
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:12,306
Congratulations!

2140
01:17:13,516 --> 01:17:15,106
Hey, get in here.

2141
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:16,546
Give me that.

2142
01:17:16,876 --> 01:17:18,206
Give me that.

2143
01:17:18,846 --> 01:17:20,306
- Master, I will go outside. - Master.

2144
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:22,846
- Master, here. - Thank you!

2145
01:17:22,906 --> 01:17:25,106
- Master. - I knew it from the start.

2146
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:27,206
- Now... - Master Gary.

2147
01:17:27,306 --> 01:17:29,906
- Master! - How dare you call my name?

2148
01:17:30,016 --> 01:17:31,206
- Then what should I call you? - He's amazing.

2149
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,306
Now he owns a big land.

2150
01:17:33,406 --> 01:17:36,016
I was going to lose anyway,

2151
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:37,676
so I'm really happy for him.

2152
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:41,016
Now he's in the situation to help the others.

2153
01:17:41,106 --> 01:17:43,646
- That's right. - You have a very good insight.

2154
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:44,906
Jong Kook!

2155
01:17:44,906 --> 01:17:46,516
You have a great insight.

2156
01:17:46,576 --> 01:17:49,406
- He's a good man. - You make me uncomfortable.

2157
01:17:49,516 --> 01:17:51,206
Look at everyone following him.

2158
01:17:51,206 --> 01:17:53,306
- Master Gary! - Master Gary!

2159
01:17:53,646 --> 01:17:55,306
- Unbelievable. - He's unbelievable.

2160
01:17:55,306 --> 01:18:00,206
(Gary took over Jong Kook.)

2161
01:18:00,306 --> 01:18:05,306
(Gary took over Jong Kook.)

2162
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:09,646
Where do you want to take next?

2163
01:18:09,706 --> 01:18:13,406
- I will hear your opinions. - Okay.

2164
01:18:13,516 --> 01:18:16,906
- My next target is Ji Hyo. - We need to take her down.

2165
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:18,846
- I will go with Ji Hyo. - If he finds her House Deed...

2166
01:18:19,306 --> 01:18:21,106
- I will try to take her land. - It will be amazing if he finds it.

2167
01:18:21,206 --> 01:18:23,646
I am certain that it's on the second floor.

2168
01:18:24,306 --> 01:18:26,516
- Because... - I think...

2169
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,306
She was...

2170
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:30,406
lying down on this room for a long time.

2171
01:18:30,516 --> 01:18:31,906
- Was she? - Yes.

2172
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:33,206
- That's strange. - Right?

2173
01:18:33,306 --> 01:18:34,906
You normally don't come inside this room.

2174
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:36,906
This piece is very neat.

2175
01:18:37,016 --> 01:18:38,106
- Which one? - This one.

2176
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:40,606
- This one is neatly attached. - That one?

2177
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,406
(From the start, Ji Hyo focused on this room.)

2178
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:45,606
I will put the House Deed...

2179
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:49,106
(Is her House Deed in this room?)

2180
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:51,906
- This is very nicely attached. - It is.

2181
01:18:52,016 --> 01:18:53,016
It's neat, but...

2182
01:18:54,206 --> 01:18:55,676
It's usually placed in a corner.

2183
01:18:56,406 --> 01:18:57,406
Or maybe it's this one?

2184
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:01,606
- This is... - This room might be a trap.

2185
01:19:01,646 --> 01:19:03,106
It's dangerous. Those two are dangerous.

2186
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:06,206
She must have put it under here earlier or she moved it.

2187
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:07,646
- It's very neatly attached. - I will rip it.

2188
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:10,106
- I've been through this, you know? - I will check this one.

2189
01:19:10,206 --> 01:19:12,206
It feels really bad.

2190
01:19:12,406 --> 01:19:14,576
(It's hard to beat Gary and his butlers.)

2191
01:19:14,606 --> 01:19:16,306
Please, please.

2192
01:19:16,306 --> 01:19:21,106
(Is the House Deed underneath that piece?)

2193
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:25,706
Come on!

2194
01:19:25,776 --> 01:19:29,306
(Bingo)

2195
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:32,106
(He finds the House Deed in one try!)

2196
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:35,206
Master Gary! Master Gary!

2197
01:19:35,306 --> 01:19:37,976
(He's as sharp as a detective!)

2198
01:19:37,976 --> 01:19:40,306
Master Gary! Master Gary!

2199
01:19:40,306 --> 01:19:42,406
(I can't believe it.)

2200
01:19:42,516 --> 01:19:44,846
- Master. - I told you.

2201
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:46,646
You are unbelievably sharp.

2202
01:19:46,706 --> 01:19:49,206
- We now have a female butler. - Yes.

2203
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:52,206
- My dear butlers... - He's taking over everything.

2204
01:19:52,206 --> 01:19:54,206
Now, there are...

2205
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:56,406
(Gary even claimed Ji Hyo's land.)

2206
01:19:56,906 --> 01:19:58,016
- There are four House Deeds left. - Four House Deeds are left.

2207
01:19:58,106 --> 01:20:00,206
- Let's go to Haha's area. - Let's do it.

2208
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:02,406
So this is going to be...

2209
01:20:02,516 --> 01:20:04,606
- This is going to be the last one. - It's the last match.

2210
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,806
(It's the last one on one match.)

2211
01:20:06,906 --> 01:20:10,016
(Why did it have to be you again?)

2212
01:20:10,016 --> 01:20:11,016
This is Haha's.

2213
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:12,846
(Haha won the first game,)

2214
01:20:12,906 --> 01:20:14,846
(claiming numerous pieces of land.)

2215
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,646
Nice. I got all the toilets.

2216
01:20:16,906 --> 01:20:17,976
(Haha established his kingdom!)

2217
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:19,016
This is my land.

2218
01:20:20,646 --> 01:20:24,606
(Haha's land is spread all over the House.)

2219
01:20:24,676 --> 01:20:26,206
(Where would his House Deed be located?)

2220
01:20:26,306 --> 01:20:27,606
Where should I put the House Deed?

2221
01:20:27,646 --> 01:20:30,646
(Where would his House Deed be located?)

2222
01:20:34,016 --> 01:20:35,206
If you were him, where would you hide it?

2223
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:37,676
I would look for a safe place first.

2224
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:40,406
And at the start,

2225
01:20:40,406 --> 01:20:42,676
you don't think about where to hide the House Deed.

2226
01:20:42,746 --> 01:20:44,846
He would've first thought about which areas to take over.

2227
01:20:44,846 --> 01:20:48,516
He would've first thought about which area would benefit him.

2228
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:51,606
Then it shouldn't be here. Let's look for the most useless area.

2229
01:20:51,676 --> 01:20:52,746
Yes.

2230
01:20:52,906 --> 01:20:53,906
Let's get this done.

2231
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,906
(Let's see.)

2232
01:20:55,906 --> 01:20:57,846
It should be somewhere.

2233
01:20:57,976 --> 01:21:00,806
(If I were him, where would I hide it?)

2234
01:21:00,846 --> 01:21:01,846
Yes.

2235
01:21:01,846 --> 01:21:04,106
(Yes!)

2236
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:05,306
That one is suspicious.

2237
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:06,806
He must have heard...

2238
01:21:06,906 --> 01:21:10,576
that you could go through the grass.

2239
01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:12,106
I will rip that one out.

2240
01:21:13,016 --> 01:21:14,016
This one is definitely suspicious.

2241
01:21:14,806 --> 01:21:15,846
It's suspicious.

2242
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:17,306
(It's suspicious.)

2243
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:20,406
(I feel it.)

2244
01:21:20,846 --> 01:21:22,776
See if the surface is loose.

2245
01:21:22,906 --> 01:21:24,206
It's not loose.

2246
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,306
Is it well-attached to the floor?

2247
01:21:26,406 --> 01:21:27,576
Yes. It's not loose.

2248
01:21:28,106 --> 01:21:29,606
(He's nervous.)

2249
01:21:30,846 --> 01:21:32,016
I will rip this one out.

2250
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:33,516
Yes, go ahead.

2251
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,606
- Now I have three chances left. - Rip it out.

2252
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:39,746
Please.

2253
01:21:41,016 --> 01:21:44,206
(Will the House Deed be...)

2254
01:21:44,306 --> 01:21:49,016
(in this useless piece of land?)

2255
01:21:49,016 --> 01:21:50,106
Please.

2256
01:21:51,576 --> 01:21:54,406
It's not here. I told you.

2257
01:21:54,516 --> 01:21:56,906
(Now Gary has only three chances.)

2258
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,806
But that one is useless too.

2259
01:21:58,846 --> 01:22:00,606
Why did he claim that piece next to the table?

2260
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:02,806
(Why did he put two pieces next to the table?)

2261
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:05,406
(I wonder why.)

2262
01:22:05,516 --> 01:22:07,206
Not that one. The one in the front.

2263
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:09,646
Why is that piece there?

2264
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:11,516
(He checks it out throughly.)

2265
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:13,016
- It's totally useless. - So...

2266
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:17,016
(I can't watch it.)

2267
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:18,846
I can't watch it.

2268
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:22,106
- I'm really suspicious of this one. - I'm suspicious of this one.

2269
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:23,306
Let's rip this one.

2270
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:24,906
- This one? - Anyway...

2271
01:22:25,016 --> 01:22:26,306
It just depends on our luck.

2272
01:22:26,406 --> 01:22:27,706
- Right. - I will rip it now.

2273
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:32,016
(This is the land nobody would want.)

2274
01:22:32,106 --> 01:22:37,016
(Is the House Deed underneath it?)

2275
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:38,306
He has too many pieces.

2276
01:22:39,106 --> 01:22:41,706
(They found the House Deed!)

2277
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:44,406
- Yes! - Yes!

2278
01:22:44,746 --> 01:22:47,516
- I told you! I told you! - Seriously?

2279
01:22:48,306 --> 01:22:52,306
(How is this possible?)

2280
01:22:52,646 --> 01:22:54,016
Really?

2281
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:55,016
(Really?)

2282
01:22:55,906 --> 01:22:57,016
We did it.

2283
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:58,106
(Gary and Jong Kook's plan worked!)

2284
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,776
I told you.

2285
01:22:59,846 --> 01:23:01,206
My butlers are the best!

2286
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:04,646
- We did it! - Look!

2287
01:23:04,906 --> 01:23:07,846
- I told you it looked suspicious. - Master! We did it!

2288
01:23:07,846 --> 01:23:09,606
We did it.

2289
01:23:09,676 --> 01:23:12,406
- I told you! - No!

2290
01:23:12,516 --> 01:23:14,776
- No way! - What did I tell you?

2291
01:23:14,776 --> 01:23:15,806
(I can't believe the squid beat me.)

2292
01:23:15,806 --> 01:23:17,406
I knew it.

2293
01:23:17,776 --> 01:23:19,016
That was useless piece of land.

2294
01:23:19,106 --> 01:23:20,906
- Master Gary! - Unbelievable.

2295
01:23:21,016 --> 01:23:22,776
- Master Gary! - Jong Kook helped me.

2296
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:23,906
Master Gary!

2297
01:23:23,906 --> 01:23:24,906
(They finished the game in two more tries.)

2298
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:27,606
- We did it! - Master Gary!

2299
01:23:27,676 --> 01:23:30,306
- Hey. - Hey.

2300
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:31,406
Pick up your bag.

2301
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:34,706
- Hey. - What?

2302
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:38,576
- Move over. - Hurry up!

2303
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,106
- Hey. - How can you find it so fast?

2304
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:41,906
Master Gary is...

2305
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:43,906
- a legend. - I had two chances left.

2306
01:23:44,406 --> 01:23:46,906
I can't believe how sharp I was.

2307
01:23:47,306 --> 01:23:49,306
This is why you need good men working for you.

2308
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:52,106
- We did it. - Yes.

2309
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,846
- Bravo. - Congratulations, Sir.

2310
01:23:54,106 --> 01:23:56,016
- You dominated the world. - He's really amazing.

2311
01:23:56,106 --> 01:23:58,106
(Gary wins the Game of the Heirs!)

2312
01:24:11,906 --> 01:24:14,906
(Gary claims the House!)

2313
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,106
- I admire you. - All right.

2314
01:24:17,206 --> 01:24:18,646
Master Gary is amazing.

2315
01:24:19,106 --> 01:24:21,906
- He's the most successful squid. - He gets travel tickets.

2316
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,846
Really? Take me with you!

2317
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:25,576
Today,

2318
01:24:25,846 --> 01:24:28,846
- Ji Yeon played a vital role. - She was amazing.

2319
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:30,776
- She was unbelievable. - She was.

2320
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:32,516
- She played so well. - Really.

2321
01:24:32,576 --> 01:24:35,106
- She can't do the simplest thing. - Right.

2322
01:24:35,206 --> 01:24:36,906
- But she did the hardest thing. - That's right.

2323
01:24:37,016 --> 01:24:40,846
This is what happens when you meet good partners.

2324
01:24:40,846 --> 01:24:43,016
- Gary is lucky with girls. - Yes.

2325
01:24:43,406 --> 01:24:44,906
How was it, Ji Yeon?

2326
01:24:45,016 --> 01:24:47,306
It was really fun playing the game.

2327
01:24:47,406 --> 01:24:49,576
I think I brought all the good luck.

2328
01:24:49,646 --> 01:24:52,306
- She just complimented herself. - She brought the good luck.

2329
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:54,806
- Ji Yeon... - Nobody even mentioned it.

2330
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:57,306
- You weren't that lucky. - We should be the one to say it.

2331
01:24:57,406 --> 01:24:59,846
I brought all the good luck and played the game well.

2332
01:25:00,406 --> 01:25:01,406
Thank you!

2333
01:25:01,516 --> 01:25:03,306
(Free travel tickets to Jeju Island)

2334
01:25:03,406 --> 01:25:05,106
- Say "Nice" once. - Say "Nice".

2335
01:25:05,206 --> 01:25:06,306
Say "Nice" please.

2336
01:25:06,406 --> 01:25:07,806
Nice!

2337
01:25:08,846 --> 01:25:09,906
- Ji Yeon is the best. - She is.

2338
01:25:10,646 --> 01:25:12,906
We should invite her here again.

2339
01:25:13,016 --> 01:25:14,846
The End
