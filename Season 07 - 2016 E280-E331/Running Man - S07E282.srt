1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,470
("The Secret of the Frozen Village")

2
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:18,407
An ice witch cast an evil spell on the...

3
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:21,977
once warm and peaceful Running Village.

4
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:26,407
All the houses were destroyed by the strong wind.

5
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:29,707
The only people left in the frozen Running Village...

6
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:32,207
are the five brothers and sisters of the Orange House and...

7
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:34,347
the five brothers and sisters of the Blue House.

8
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:37,817
Only 10 children now live in the village.

9
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:41,577
Do you want to know who these children are?

10
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:48,547
(The children are inside the fairy tale book.)

11
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:52,347
The oldest of the brothers and sisters of the Orange House,

12
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:56,307
Seok Jin, had a habit of talking to himself.

13
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:57,607
(He acts like he's talking.)

14
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,207
He talked to himself.

15
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,307
This is so annoying...

16
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,977
The second oldest of the Orange House, Jae Seok,

17
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:06,607
always complained to his older brother...

18
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,517
- that he was being too loud. - You talk way too much.

19
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,477
- No, you talk too much. - You always talk too much.

20
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:13,707
When Jae Seok hit Seok Jin,

21
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,707
Seok Jin didn't try to stop him.

22
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:19,277
When Jae Seok hit Seok Jin again,

23
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:20,547
(Jae Seok hits Seok Jin.)

24
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,107
Seok Jin got very angry...

25
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,407
but didn't do anything about it.

26
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,607
There was only one person who could make them be quiet.

27
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:30,707
That person is Jong Kook, the oldest son...

28
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,707
of the Blue House,

29
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:35,077
which is the sworn enemy of the Orange House.

30
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,607
Seok Jin, who was older than Jong Kook,

31
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:40,407
always tried to fight him.

32
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:43,607
But he was no match for Jong Kook.

33
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,907
Even when Jae Seok and Seok Jin joined forces,

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,707
they were still no match for Jong Kook.

35
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:50,707
(Jong Kook is victorious.)

36
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,207
Jong Kook had...

37
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:56,107
two younger brothers, Haha and Kwang Soo.

38
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,607
Haha, who was short,

39
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,207
and Kwang Soo, who was tall,

40
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,407
got along very well. The two brothers were...

41
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,207
best buddies.

42
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:07,507
With their arms around each other's shoulders, they slept together.

43
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,977
- Catch! - They played basketball.

44
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:11,207
(They look very uncomfortable.)

45
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,807
And they danced together.

46
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:14,477
Quiet.

47
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,707
Running Village has...

48
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,707
another secret.

49
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,377
The youngest daughter of the Blue House, Ji Hyo,

50
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:25,107
and Gary, the third son of the Orange House,

51
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:27,607
were dating despite their brothers' strong disapproval.

52
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:29,477
- What are you doing? - What?

53
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:32,707
When their brothers were nearby, the couple pretended...

54
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,807
to hate each other and pulled each other's hair.

55
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:36,807
(They are fighting to the death.)

56
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,577
- Go. - Beat him up.

57
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,377
- I hate you. - Beat him up.

58
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:43,577
- I hate you. - That's right.

59
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:46,577
(Giggling)

60
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,907
- Where is she going? - Where are you headed?

61
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,107
- It's like a real fairy tale. - Where is she going?

62
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:57,077
(Which house will the next child belong to?)

63
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,007
The fourth son of the Blue House, Si Wan...

64
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,207
- What? - Si Wan is here?

65
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:04,707
- Is he here? - He was so handsome he had his...

66
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,477
- Is it Si Wan? - own fan club...

67
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:09,007
- Is it Yim Si Wan? - in the village.

68
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,377
(The fourth son of the Blue House is so handsome he has a fan club.)

69
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:13,307
- Yim Si Wan. - It's really Yim Si Wan.

70
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:15,307
(He is very handsome.)

71
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,807
(Running Village's most popular man, Si Wan)

72
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:22,207
(He is fiercely charismatic...)

73
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:25,077
(and has incredible acting skills.)

74
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,977
(Yim Si Wan has become a renowned actor in his own right.)

75
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,347
- Nice to see you. - Hello, Si Wan.

76
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,907
(Intelligent and determined, Si Wan always tries his best.)

77
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,607
- Wow. - Long time no see.

78
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:38,007
(But he was always the first one to be eliminated.)

79
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:39,707
- Hello. - Si Wan.

80
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:40,807
You're very good looking.

81
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:43,807
(Girls go crazy when he waves at them.)

82
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,207
- I'm your biggest fan. - I'm your biggest fan.

83
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,807
- I'm your biggest fan. - I'm your biggest fan.

84
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,177
- I'm your biggest fan. - He is very good looking.

85
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,107
(She is going crazy over him.)

86
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:51,447
(She is a huge fan of Si Wan.)

87
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:55,007
He even danced with Yun Hwa, who was right next to him.

88
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,407
Is that really in the story?

89
00:03:56,807 --> 00:04:00,477
(She doesn't care about the story. She wants to dance with him.)

90
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,347
- I'm your biggest fan. - Si Wan...

91
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,977
is the biggest star in Running Village.

92
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,347
Let's...

93
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,547
- go. - Where are you going?

94
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,907
- There's another one? - There must be another guest.

95
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,547
- Over there. - There must be someone else.

96
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,607
Is it one of my family members?

97
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,107
The fourth son of the Orange House...

98
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:19,577
- Our house? - is Hee Jun.

99
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,807
- Moon Hee Jun? - Moon Hee Jun?

100
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:21,907
That fat guy?

101
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,217
This is the original super star of the village.

102
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:28,477
(Is it a member of H.O.T?)

103
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:31,307
(The fourth son is...)

104
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,477
(the renowned actor, Lee Hee Jun.)

105
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,717
(The fourth son of the Orange House, Lee Hee Jun)

106
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,547
(Sometimes, he plays a charismatic, tough character.)

107
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,977
(Other times, he plays a romantic, charming character.)

108
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,607
- He's handsome. - He is handsome.

109
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:45,977
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

110
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,347
It's so nice to meet you.

111
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,507
- Wow. - Each house needs a handsome son.

112
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:51,577
- Right. - That's right.

113
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,077
Although he's not that good looking, he's still...

114
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,607
- He's charming. - He is very charming.

115
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,607
- He's still very charming. - Right.

116
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:00,807
Hee Jun was great...

117
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,447
at singing.

118
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,477
(Hee Jun was great at singing...)

119
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,447
He was also good at dancing.

120
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,507
(and tap dancing.)

121
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,447
Hee Jun was the most talented man in Running Village.

122
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:14,477
- He's very talented. - My brother.

123
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,277
- Join us. - Right.

124
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,217
(He looks more charming by the minute.)

125
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,007
Next is...

126
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,377
We have to go over there now?

127
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:23,607
(They're going to meet the final child.)

128
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:24,807
- Slow down. - Where...

129
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,907
- are you going? - Where are we going?

130
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,447
In the Orange House, there lived...

131
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:32,347
a young girl named A Sung.

132
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,577
- A Sung? - Is she really here?

133
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,577
(A Sung? Can it be?)

134
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:41,377
(She's very young and cute.)

135
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:47,077
(The youngest daughter of the Orange House, A Sung)

136
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,377
(The cute girl from "The Host"...)

137
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,607
(has now taken Hollywood by storm.)

138
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:57,447
(Over the years she has become a much beloved Korean actress.)

139
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,207
- Wow. - This is great.

140
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,607
- Wow. - Amazing.

141
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,007
The last child was A Sung.

142
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,607
- A Sung... - Yes.

143
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:09,007
was an adorable girl who had a beautiful smile.

144
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,107
(She had a beautiful smile.)

145
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,807
- Wow. - Throw some flower petals.

146
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:14,907
(Now she looks even prettier.)

147
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:19,207
Mesmerised by her charms, the village's boys were left speechless.

148
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:23,377
(The boys are mesmerised by her beauty.)

149
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,347
(They are crazy about her.)

150
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,477
Her brothers of the Orange House...

151
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,507
- did everything she told them to. - Right.

152
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,177
- It's too cold outside. - You're cold?

153
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:33,377
- What? - Hold on, I'm coming.

154
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,477
Wait. Take this.

155
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:35,807
- Here you go. - But that's my...

156
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:36,907
- Here you go. - Take it off.

157
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,807
(What? Why does it have to be me?)

158
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,807
I knew he wasn't going to take off his own coat.

159
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,707
She only needs one coat.

160
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:46,447
You should take yours off too.

161
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,007
- I'm still cold. - Take it off.

162
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,307
- Take it off. - Take it off.

163
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,377
Hey!

164
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,347
- No, that's okay. - Take your clothes off.

165
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,447
- Are you cold? - You have a lot of clothes on.

166
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,507
- A Sung says she's cold. - No.

167
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:57,607
Let go.

168
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:58,807
Why does it have to be me?

169
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,607
What adventures will Ji Hyo's...

170
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:05,007
family and A Sung's family have now that...

171
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:08,507
the ice witch has transformed Running Village...

172
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:11,077
into the Frozen Village?

173
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,477
Ji Hyo's family and A Sung's family went to...

174
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:19,277
the place where their homes used to be.

175
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,807
However,

176
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,907
the witch's curse had already...

177
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,507
- destroyed their houses. - Where did my house go?

178
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:26,577
- Mum. - Where did it go?

179
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,007
Mother!

180
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,607
- What's going on? - Stop doing things like that.

181
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,277
- It's cliche. - Exactly.

182
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,307
- I'm sorry, I'll try harder. - The viewers don't find it funny.

183
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:36,607
Say that you're sorry.

184
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:37,607
- Right. - I apologise.

185
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,077
(He promises to make better jokes in the future.)

186
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:44,277
As they shivered in the cold, Ji Hyo and A Sung...

187
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,377
insisted that their brothers build them...

188
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,677
- a new house. - At least they're not asking...

189
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,177
- us to buy a new house. - Right.

190
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:52,577
- That's a relief. - Right.

191
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,607
- At least they're being reasonable. - Right.

192
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,177
They looked very cute as they whined...

193
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,807
- to their brothers. - That's right.

194
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,007
- All right. - Be cute.

195
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,077
- Be cute. - Yes, be cute.

196
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,507
- Try being cute. - Yes, let's see it.

197
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,607
Please build a house for me.

198
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,977
(Please build a house for me.)

199
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,347
She's very cute.

200
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,807
- Among the 10 people... - Ji Hyo, you should give it a shot.

201
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,107
- That's how it's done. - Please build me a nice house.

202
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,807
Please build me a nice house.

203
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,747
Hey.

204
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:20,707
(They are so violent to each other.)

205
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,977
- Have you gone insane? - What are you doing?

206
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,577
- What on earth was that? - What are you doing?

207
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,307
Family aren't supposed to kick each other.

208
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,707
The brothers gave their little sisters piggyback rides...

209
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:34,907
so that their feet didn't touch...

210
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,107
- the snow. - Hey, give me a piggyback ride.

211
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,207
(She demands a piggyback ride.)

212
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,317
- Hurry up. - One person should do that.

213
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:43,447
Now the brothers went to gather ice...

214
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,107
so that they could build their houses.

215
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,607
- What? - Where is the ice?

216
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:49,677
- Where is it? - It's over there.

217
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,547
- Do we go right now? - How do we carry the ice?

218
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,607
- There it is. - It's over here.

219
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,607
Where is it?

220
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,207
Here it is.

221
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,707
We have to bring as much as we can in one trip.

222
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:59,707
How do we carry the ice?

223
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,277
- Is that the ice? - Do we get it from here?

224
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,077
- Is this really the place? - How do we carry the ice?

225
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,207
- This is really... - There's no point in...

226
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,707
- trying to carry this. - It's too large.

227
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:06,977
You can't carry it...

228
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,077
There's no point in...

229
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,817
- trying to carry it. - Seok Jin.

230
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:11,907
- What? - There are sleds over there.

231
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,077
- Really? - There they are.

232
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:15,477
There are sleds over there.

233
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,407
You should have told us in private.

234
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:18,477
(The other team heard her.)

235
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:19,977
You should have told us in private.

236
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:21,177
I didn't think that through.

237
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:24,277
- Where are they? - Go where Jae Seok is right now.

238
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,317
Jong Kook, we have sled. Why would you...

239
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,107
- They're over there. - Where?

240
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:30,607
- Over there. - Oh, over there?

241
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:33,407
- They're over here. - Because it's heavy...

242
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,607
Here they are.

243
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,007
Why are you so slow?

244
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,077
(Seok Jin is slowing things down.)

245
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,347
Put me down over there.

246
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,207
Just my feet shouldn't touch the ground.

247
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,007
- Put me down. - Okay.

248
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,207
I can put her down here, right?

249
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,477
Then hold on.

250
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:49,817
Here we go.

251
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,817
(She fell onto the snow.)

252
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:56,577
(Technically, only her bottom and back are on the snow.)

253
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:57,817
It's fine as long as your feet don't touch the snow?

254
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:00,317
So it's okay as long as her feet don't touch the ground?

255
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,507
(She's being dragged on the floor.)

256
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:03,677
- Hey! - Hey!

257
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,407
It's all right as long as the feet don't touch the ground.

258
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:06,977
- Good job. - Just don't put her feet down.

259
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,317
- Good job. - Wait.

260
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,317
- Hey! - Wait.

261
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,507
Hang in there, Kwang Soo.

262
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:12,607
You just have to keep your feet in the air.

263
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,817
(He lifts her.)

264
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,977
Hold on.

265
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:16,977
That's it.

266
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:19,677
Let's go.

267
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,407
There.

268
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,817
(Oh dear!)

269
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,577
Let me help you.

270
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:28,607
I can put my feet here.

271
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:30,507
It's cold.

272
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:32,147
It's cold!

273
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:35,107
(It turns out Hee Jun is such a sweet brother.)

274
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,317
It's so comfortable.

275
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:37,817
This is so comfortable.

276
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,947
(Run, Hee Jun!)

277
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:46,817
(While Hee Jun and A Sung are having a good time...)

278
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,047
Are you all set?

279
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,817
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are carrying the ice.)

280
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:52,177
(Ji Hyo slides off from the sled.)

281
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,317
Hey!

282
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:56,307
- Kwang Soo! - Stay there.

283
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:58,307
It's so light now.

284
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:59,907
Stay there for a while.

285
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,307
Hee Jun.

286
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,677
- I'll be right back. - Hee Jun, please load the ice.

287
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,147
This one.

288
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,077
- Wait! - Hold on.

289
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,877
- That's our ice! - I'm sorry.

290
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,007
They are our enemies.

291
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:10,707
Ji Hyo, just crawl using your hands.

292
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,207
Just crawl.

293
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,807
Just make sure your feet don't touch the ground.

294
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,707
You used to be very good at crawling when you were young.

295
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:19,177
But this is an uphill.

296
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,947
- Yes. - Life is an uphill.

297
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,947
Take me!

298
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:28,407
(I hate you guys!)

299
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:29,877
When will we finish stacking all those ice cubes?

300
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,947
We have to stack everything here?

301
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,147
(It's been 20 minutes since they began building the igloo.)

302
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,077
This is crazy.

303
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:36,507
(Now the once desolate building site is...)

304
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,977
(getting filled with ice.)

305
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:39,677
Gosh...

306
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,407
Until when do we have to do this?

307
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,177
Is there another way to do this?

308
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,107
This is crazy.

309
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,307
(Team Ji Hyo and Team A Sung are trying hard to build the igloo.)

310
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,677
He's trying to steal it.

311
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:51,877
- He's trying to steal it. - Leave it.

312
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:53,407
Okay. I dropped it.

313
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:55,607
Gosh.

314
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,307
Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors...

315
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,077
- and bet ice? - Pardon?

316
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:00,707
How do you want to do it?

317
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,077
The winner gets the ice.

318
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,307
- We'll play rock-paper-scissors? - Let's just play it once.

319
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,147
- Let's play fair. - Gosh.

320
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,807
- Let's play fair and square. - Right.

321
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,877
- What will you give? - What?

322
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,147
What will you give?

323
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,607
I'm going to give scissors.

324
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:13,707
- Scissors? - Yes.

325
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,077
Rock, paper, scissors.

326
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,307
(They both gave rock.)

327
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,407
You said you'd give scissors.

328
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:19,807
You believed that?

329
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,307
Rock, paper, scissors.

330
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,507
Give me that ice.

331
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,907
Why did you do that?

332
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,307
- Good job! - Si Wan!

333
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:28,677
I'm so upset.

334
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,807
Why did you do that?

335
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:36,677
(He's not only smart but also hard-working.)

336
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,147
- Si Wan, you are... - He's such a reliable person.

337
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,507
I will just leave everything here.

338
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:43,607
You are amazing, Si Wan.

339
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,507
You're good.

340
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,607
(Si Wan is Team Ji Hyo's dark horse.)

341
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,877
(With his brain and quick wit,)

342
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:58,107
(he showed how well he could build a house in a jungle.)

343
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,777
- The third... - Where should I put it?

344
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:02,907
All right.

345
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:04,407
(He becomes Si Wan the Architect once again.)

346
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,507
If we put the pillars there,

347
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,107
it will be a right triangle.

348
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:09,307
It will be a triangle like this.

349
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,947
And we will build it up like this.

350
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,207
- If it can be supported... - Okay.

351
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:14,107
- Okay! - He's right.

352
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:16,207
Si Wan is the best.

353
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,207
- If it doesn't work... - He's a smart guy.

354
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,207
- Si Wan, you are... - He's such a reliable man.

355
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,407
This is really...

356
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:25,947
How can we do this?

357
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,047
- Si Wan is... - Si Wan is really diligent.

358
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,307
(They don't have much time left to finish the igloo.)

359
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:32,047
(Move, boys!)

360
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:33,307
Today's theme is a fairy tale,

361
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,107
but we are doing manual labour.

362
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,007
This is crazy.

363
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:39,247
(It's a fairy tale about a sweatshop.)

364
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:41,207
Gosh, my hands hurt.

365
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,577
Magic, magic.

366
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,207
Winter fairies came...

367
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,407
to help the tired boys.

368
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,607
- Fairies? - Fairies?

369
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:55,107
"We will help you build the igloo."

370
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,107
(Singing a yodel song)

371
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:58,307
(She cracks up.)

372
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:59,947
"But only one team..."

373
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,407
"gets to get our help."

374
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,807
- Which language is that? - What's wrong with the fairy?

375
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,807
- What is she doing? - She's just a woman from here.

376
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,077
Why is she singing a yodel song?

377
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:09,677
The boys decided to play...

378
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:12,407
"My Darling Sister" game...

379
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,947
and win the fairies' hearts.

380
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:16,977
- "My Darling Little Sister" game? - "My Darling Little Sister" game?

381
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,247
This is how you play the "My Darling Little Sister" game.

382
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:23,207
The boys will first lie down on the floor on their back.

383
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,577
Using both hands and feet,

384
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:27,407
they will support the board.

385
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,947
They will slowly move the board...

386
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,207
and move their little sister on top of the board.

387
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:37,207
The team of the girl who rings the bell first will be the winner.

388
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,247
Okay.

389
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:40,507
Kwang Soo, Haha, come here.

390
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:42,147
Let's win this.

391
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,507
- This is going to work. - I will move towards the bell.

392
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,307
Just support the part where I stand.

393
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,107
Don't mind the end part.

394
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,307
When we move, you move.

395
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,677
- Right. - We can do it.

396
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:52,047
- If you don't support it well... - Two people will be...

397
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,207
supporting you, so it won't be heavy at all.

398
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,407
- Okay. - It won't be hard.

399
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:57,207
- Do we have to crawl like this? - We can line up in one line...

400
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:00,207
and then go forward.

401
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,307
How?

402
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:03,077
We will just line up in one long line.

403
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:04,407
And then we will just go forward?

404
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,207
We will move the board in one line.

405
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,407
Wait. Wait.

406
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,707
Will we be able to support her?

407
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,077
- Go up. - Hey...

408
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,807
You can run too.

409
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,607
- Ready. - Support it well.

410
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,047
- We have to use our knees? - Let's...

411
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,607
Put your knees on the board.

412
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,507
Let's go.

413
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,007
- Let's go. - Do they touch the board?

414
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,047
(Team Ji Hyo moves in pairs.)

415
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,177
Hurry. Hurry.

416
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,907
- Just go. - Hurry up.

417
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:28,777
- Hurry. - Go forward.

418
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,147
- All right. Go more. - We are faster.

419
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,407
- We are faster. - Hurry.

420
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:34,947
- We are faster. - Move more.

421
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,307
- We are faster! - Hurry!

422
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,977
- We are faster! - Next person!

423
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,407
- I am here! - Hurry.

424
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,607
Hurry!

425
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,577
We are almost there! Come on!

426
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,007
We are almost there!

427
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,807
- We are almost there! - We are almost there!

428
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:50,047
Let's go to the end!

429
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:56,107
(Which team will be getting help from the winter fairies?)

430
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,307
- We are almost there! - We are almost there!

431
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,607
Let's go to the end!

432
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,807
- Come on! - Go to the end!

433
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:03,947
(Team Ji Hyo wins.)

434
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,407
Okay. We lost?

435
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,507
We won!

436
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,707
We won!

437
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,307
- We did it! - We did it!

438
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,007
Wasn't she supposed to do it while she's up?

439
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,307
We did it.

440
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,507
We did it.

441
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:14,607
(We don't have to work now!)

442
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,307
- We did it! - We did it!

443
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:20,207
(Disappointed)

444
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,207
Team Ji Hyo won...

445
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,147
and got the fairies' help.

446
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,407
And the built the igloo...

447
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,007
in no time.

448
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,907
- That would scare the fairies. - The fairies!

449
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,207
Look at the fairies!

450
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:33,577
The fairies!

451
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,947
- They are the fairies! - They are the fairies!

452
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,307
(Winter fairies came to help.)

453
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,707
- This is amazing. - I envy you.

454
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,577
- They are here to help us. - I guess they are.

455
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:41,177
We were betting on that?

456
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,977
Since there are so many of them, we don't have to do anything.

457
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,047
Right.

458
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:46,947
- You should take this. - Take this.

459
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,707
- All right! - You cut this?

460
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,607
- No. - Cheer up, everyone!

461
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,947
- Cheer up! - They are so fast.

462
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:54,307
(With the help of the fairies, Ji Hyo's igloo gets done fast.)

463
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:56,047
Our team is amazing.

464
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:57,207
Just do three each.

465
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,677
- I am so thankful to them. - I love you!

466
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:01,177
Our igloo is so shabby.

467
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,977
(They are installing a tarp.)

468
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:05,207
That's a tarp?

469
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,047
This is not how it's supposed to look.

470
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:08,807
Good days will come too.

471
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,947
I will earn a lot of money and build you a nice igloo.

472
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,877
It's big enough to lie down.

473
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,877
Why don't we put another tarp over here?

474
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,017
Another tarp...

475
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,877
Our igloo is too shabby.

476
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,777
- This is not it. - Their igloo is so nice.

477
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,307
- Well, this is... - That's good enough.

478
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:25,407
Be quiet, everyone.

479
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,207
You have to wrap the igloo like this.

480
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,307
(Ji Hyo's ice palace is revealed.)

481
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:30,307
- Okay. - That's nice.

482
00:17:30,907 --> 00:17:32,607
- Wow. - It's like a real house.

483
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,807
You're right. It's like a real house.

484
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:36,607
- Have a seat here. - There's no other way.

485
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:38,707
- Yes, there is no other way. - It's quite all right.

486
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,207
This is perfect.

487
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,707
The tarp should've been a little bit wider.

488
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:44,577
You can't keep breaking into our place.

489
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,807
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

490
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,307
- You are so fussy. - What are you doing?

491
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,307
- It was your place? - That's trespassing.

492
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:51,207
- Don't trespass. - I didn't know it was a house.

493
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,107
- You didn't know? - Gosh.

494
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,107
- You live there? - Yes!

495
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,907
It's our house. Look at my family all sitting down.

496
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,407
(Don't look down on us.)

497
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,607
- Gosh. - What's that?

498
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:02,807
We are naturalists.

499
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,147
Ji Hyo's got help...

500
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,307
from the fairies and...

501
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,517
built the house in no time.

502
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,017
- Magic! - Magic!

503
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,307
For Ji Hyo and A Sung,

504
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,577
who didn't get to eat while building the igloo,

505
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,677
the boys decide to go on hunting.

506
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,017
- Hunting? - Hunting?

507
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:25,307
Which of their brothers will be going hunting?

508
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,977
Get rid of this fairy tale!

509
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,807
- This is crazy. - Until when do we have to do this?

510
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:33,207
Please choose the most handsome...

511
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:35,517
- and the ugliest brother each. - It's Si Wan then.

512
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:36,677
- Start now. - It's Si Wan and...

513
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:37,807
- Kwang Soo then. - What are you talking about?

514
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,517
- You two should go. - What are you talking about?

515
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,577
- It's you. - Gosh,

516
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:41,677
- it's not me. - It must be so tough...

517
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:43,147
- for this team. - Hee Jun.

518
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,107
- I'm not the ugliest. - Why would you...

519
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,017
- I'm not the ugliest. - That's not it.

520
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,517
Hee Jun is voted as the most handsome because he's in our team.

521
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,807
- Seriously. - You're not that handsome though.

522
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:54,207
- You're lucky to be in our team. - Yes.

523
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,207
- Thank you. - The little sisters...

524
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,517
decide to follow their brothers on hunting.

525
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,777
- Oh! - Oh.

526
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,077
- Yes! - Maybe we will really go hunting?

527
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,307
- We will go now. - All right. Take care.

528
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:05,607
- Hunt a lot. We're starving. - We will hunt something.

529
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,177
- Hunt a lot. - We will hunt something.

530
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,407
- Please wait for us. - Our house is perfect.

531
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:15,407
(Team Ji Hyo heads to the hunting ground.)

532
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:16,777
I'm starving.

533
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,607
It turns out Si Wan is not that good at playing games.

534
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,147
I am not good at playing games.

535
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,807
I like playing games though. So I always watch Running Man...

536
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,907
- You like playing games? - Yes.

537
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:27,077
I love it.

538
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,207
(He's got passion, but he's got no talent for it.)

539
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,517
Do you cook well?

540
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:32,517
These days, I cook at home.

541
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,517
- You do? - Really?

542
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,777
I usually cook chicken breast fried rice.

543
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,707
I sometimes eat it with tortilla.

544
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:42,047
- How do you do it? - That sounds delicious.

545
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:43,147
It's really delicious.

546
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,047
I took a picture of it with my phone. It was delicious.

547
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,307
You were proud of yourself, so you took a picture of it.

548
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,877
- Yes. - I never knew you do that.

549
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:54,517
(This is the picture in Si Wan's phone.)

550
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:55,947
You're nothing like what I expected.

551
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:58,047
I cook sometimes these days.

552
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,747
But no one has tasted my dishes yet.

553
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:03,407
We can taste them today.

554
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:06,177
Anything tastes good...

555
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,677
when you eat outdoors.

556
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:10,777
But that's just my opinion.

557
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:11,907
(But that's just my opinion.)

558
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,017
Please don't be so sure of yourself.

559
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:17,177
I like fishing, by the way.

560
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,017
Where do you go fishing?

561
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,307
I usually go sea fishing.

562
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,107
I've caught a lot of rockfish.

563
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:26,517
I've even caught saw-edged perch a few times.

564
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:29,207
- Really? - In Jeju Island.

565
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:30,647
That's amazing. You caught saw-edged perch?

566
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,907
You must be good at it. Please show your skills today.

567
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:34,547
I'll do my best.

568
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:36,677
(If they go fishing today, Si Wan will be able to contribute.)

569
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:40,377
(A Sung and her family are also on their way to find food.)

570
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,677
As I'm an actor, I'm not used to being...

571
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:46,777
in front of so many cameras all at once. I get confused.

572
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,307
You have only one camera when you're acting.

573
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:50,907
You can ignore all of them.

574
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,517
What do the others do while we find food?

575
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:57,307
I'm sure they're doing something.

576
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:58,477
Of course.

577
00:20:58,547 --> 00:20:59,547
(What are the others doing while we search for food?)

578
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:04,017
Until the brothers and sisters come back from their hunt,

579
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:08,517
the other members will find cooking utensils and other ingredients.

580
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:11,407
They're going to first decide...

581
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:14,547
which items they want.

582
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:17,407
And then they have to win games to acquire them.

583
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,477
(Up-to-date utensils vs old-fashioned utensils)

584
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:20,907
If we get that one, we can make anything.

585
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:22,407
Exactly.

586
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:23,547
Oh, there's dongchimi.

587
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,477
I'm suddenly craving some dongchimi.

588
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:29,017
Even just dongchimi and rice will be nice.

589
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:32,907
- We need spoons and chopsticks. - You eat dongchimi with rice?

590
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,107
- How can you do that? - Dongchimi is nice with rice.

591
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,907
- You eat dongchimi with rice? - It's delicious.

592
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,017
Really?

593
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,407
- I didn't know people did that. - You just don't understand.

594
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:42,277
Charcoal-grilled squid is amazing.

595
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:45,177
(It offended Gary.)

596
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:48,477
(Is he talking about me?)

597
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,477
(Now, he reminds everyone of squid.)

598
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:51,647
Put me on charcoal.

599
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,407
Go ahead.

600
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:56,607
- I'm just joking. - Try and see if I can be grilled.

601
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:57,807
(An angry squid)

602
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,107
(It's funny.)

603
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:02,407
The first game is called...

604
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,677
31 Lemons.

605
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,507
- What's that? - 31 Lemons?

606
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:09,507
We have 31 lemons here.

607
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,807
- You're going to eat them in turns. - Are we going to eat them?

608
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:15,277
The one who gets to eat the 31st lemon...

609
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:16,407
That's mean.

610
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,377
- That's too many. - I get the idea.

611
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:21,007
You can choose to eat 1 to 3 lemons at a time.

612
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,907
- Do we have to swallow them? - Should we start? Let's start.

613
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:26,907
- "Let's eat 31 lemons." - "Let's eat 31 lemons."

614
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:29,107
(Seok Jin goes first.)

615
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:30,807
- You have to pick the right one. - Done.

616
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,377
- Done. - Are you taking only one?

617
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:34,547
- Say how many you're going to eat. - I'll eat one lemon.

618
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:35,677
You can decide how many later.

619
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:38,707
Let's decide as you go.

620
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,747
I just touched it with my tongue and it stings.

621
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:43,807
I only touched it with my tongue.

622
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,107
I'm not going to chew it.

623
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,677
(Here it goes.)

624
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:48,847
(He bit the lemon.)

625
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,007
My stomach is sensitive.

626
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,277
(Sucking up the lemon juice)

627
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,577
That looks like a mouth guard.

628
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:57,677
Get up.

629
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:59,207
(Vitamin C overload)

630
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,607
- This is terrible. - I can feel his pain.

631
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:03,477
(Everybody's feeling his pain.)

632
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:07,307
The 31st person to eat the lemon will end the game.

633
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:08,677
I'll eat one.

634
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:10,277
It's awful.

635
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,577
It'll depend on what Gary will do.

636
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:13,607
(He becomes ugly.)

637
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:14,777
Look at his face.

638
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,007
(You look so ugly.)

639
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,277
(Too sour)

640
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,407
This is terrible.

641
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:22,807
Does he have to exaggerate like that?

642
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,907
- He's acting. - I'm not acting.

643
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:27,177
- He's certainly not acting. - Why does he have to act?

644
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:28,907
He's not acting.

645
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,907
- Are you stopping at one? - I drooled.

646
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:34,007
(Gary sets out to find out the truth.)

647
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,207
(Let's see.)

648
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:40,677
(Too sour)

649
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:42,007
You see?

650
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:44,677
- You said he was acting. - The squid is being grilled.

651
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:45,907
The squid is being grilled.

652
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,547
(This squid contains a lot of Vitamin C.)

653
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,107
(He's in pain.)

654
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:52,007
(The squid squirts the ink.)

655
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:53,107
Boy, it's sour.

656
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:54,277
(He is worried.)

657
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:55,907
- You have to finish that. - It's finished.

658
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:57,677
- There's some left. - Finish it.

659
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,107
- Are you stopping at one? - Yes.

660
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:00,277
Are you stopping at one?

661
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,207
I was going to eat two, but it's impossible.

662
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,207
Eat three.

663
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:06,577
Even eating two of them is hard.

664
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:08,507
- She seems to like it. - Do you like it?

665
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,407
- I'll just eat it up. - No!

666
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:11,947
- Is it tasty? - No, no.

667
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,907
(Sucking the juice)

668
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,007
Is this sour for you?

669
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:17,207
- Of course it is. - I don't think it's sour.

670
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,307
(Biting the lemon)

671
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,477
How can she do that?

672
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:22,407
(She ate all of it.)

673
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,007
How can this be possible?

674
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,207
- Were you hungry? - It's not an orange.

675
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:28,107
It's not sour. It's not bad.

676
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:31,007
Now they'll think we were exaggerating.

677
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,177
(Is her tongue made of steel?)

678
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,307
This can't be possible.

679
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,847
- How many is she going to eat? - Hey, you're crying.

680
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,677
Your eyes teared up as you were eating.

681
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:42,907
Why are you crying?

682
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,407
(Say something.)

683
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:49,907
(Your eyes are telling a different story.)

684
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:53,907
(Have you been crying on the inside?)

685
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,677
This lemon is...

686
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,747
so delicious.

687
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,607
Let's shuffle when we're halfway through.

688
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:04,407
Jong Kook...

689
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:06,007
is already calculating.

690
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,207
He's guessing Haha will lose.

691
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:09,307
(He's always looking ahead.)

692
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,277
- It's hard to even eat two. - It's too sour.

693
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,807
(Will Jong Kook conquer the lemon?)

694
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:19,177
(Squid number one)

695
00:25:20,707 --> 00:25:22,907
(Squid number two)

696
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,707
(Squid number three)

697
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,907
(Squid number four)

698
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:35,407
(Which team will acquire the nice utensils?)

699
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:38,307
(The other members arrived at the hunting ground.)

700
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,907
Using the prepared tools,

701
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,007
catch as many trouts as you can.

702
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,107
(Catch the trouts under the ice.)

703
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,107
This one is better.

704
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,407
You have an hour.

705
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:49,807
You should catch as many as possible during the hour...

706
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:51,407
for your family.

707
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:55,007
(Taking care of his little sister)

708
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,407
Do we get blankets?

709
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:57,907
- Yes. - I brought it.

710
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,107
- It's not given. - It's her own.

711
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:01,307
- What? - She brought it from home.

712
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,577
I have one at home too.

713
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:03,677
Then go get it.

714
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,007
(Then go get it.)

715
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:06,207
(It's not a good idea to argue with Jae Seok.)

716
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,507
We brought a blanket.

717
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,607
We're fishing.

718
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:09,807
Why don't we start?

719
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,207
- Let's start. - Shall we go?

720
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:13,107
We'll get started.

721
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:14,907
They took all the tools.

722
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,507
Hurry up!

723
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:17,907
Let me borrow your blanket.

724
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,407
I think this one will be better than a lure.

725
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:21,547
- Is this better? - I think so.

726
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:22,707
(Si Wan even knows fishing terms.)

727
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:23,907
Is this how you do it?

728
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,407
Si Wan goes fishing a lot. Is this better?

729
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:28,507
Yes. That one is called "lure". But that one won't catch a lot.

730
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:29,677
I see.

731
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:32,777
I think we need some blankets, too.

732
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,407
(Let's see how many fish they'll catch.)

733
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:39,707
(Jae Seok is worried that A Sung would get too cold.)

734
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,107
A Sung, sit on the chair.

735
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,107
Wait.

736
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:45,607
Where's my blanket?

737
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,547
(The blanket is right on his back.)

738
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:54,007
(My blanket is gone.)

739
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:57,777
(It must be floating around somewhere.)

740
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,707
(He's getting goosebumps.)

741
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:03,007
(The wind blew the blanket off.)

742
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,207
There it is.

743
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,477
(The wind saved him.)

744
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:08,407
- A Sung, sit on the chair. - I'm fine, thank you.

745
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,107
You can sit here.

746
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,307
- Do you see the fish there? - Where?

747
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:12,377
Right here.

748
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:14,007
There you go.

749
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:15,407
(He's taking good care of A Sung.)

750
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,007
You can see the fish under the ice.

751
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,607
(They're looking for good spots.)

752
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:23,807
(A Sung tries catching one.)

753
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,807
(Trying to break the ice)

754
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:27,807
(Catch me if you can.)

755
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,207
I want to catch it. What should I do?

756
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:32,907
(I want to catch it. What should I do?)

757
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,407
I just want to catch at least one.

758
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:35,577
(I just want to catch at least one.)

759
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:37,907
A Sung,

760
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:39,507
do you see any fish?

761
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:42,207
No, I don't see any.

762
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,507
(No, I don't see any.)

763
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:44,577
Wait.

764
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,407
(Wait.)

765
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,807
(Did she find something already?)

766
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:52,607
(Will A Sung be the first one to catch trout?)

767
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,707
That wasn't it.

768
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:55,777
Trout are orange...

769
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,577
and the ice reflects my jacket.

770
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:02,607
(Are you sure you're not mistaking goldfish for trout?)

771
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:06,577
(I couldn't let the novice catch the first fish.)

772
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,907
(Si Wan takes action.)

773
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:13,907
(This is the beginning of a legend.)

774
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,277
I like fishing.

775
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:19,577
I've caught a lot of rockfish.

776
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:22,007
I've even caught saw-edged perch a few times.

777
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,107
Really?

778
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,577
(Fishing is all about patience and concentration.)

779
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,747
(Focused)

780
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:30,807
Si Wan.

781
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:32,807
Show me how to do it.

782
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:33,907
(Show me how to do it.)

783
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:34,907
First,

784
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,307
let me try.

785
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:39,107
Let me find out how we should do it.

786
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:41,107
I heard where you fish is also important.

787
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:44,207
Should we go out to the borders of the lake?

788
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:47,407
- Will that be better? - I'm not sure.

789
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:50,007
Should we try near the border?

790
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:51,707
(Si Wan tries to get away from him so he can concentrate.)

791
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:53,747
(But Kwang Soo follows Si Wan.)

792
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,577
The fish might be around the border since it's cold.

793
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:58,847
Si Wan, how do I take this out?

794
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:00,707
- Si Wan. - Yes.

795
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:01,807
How do I do it?

796
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:04,607
Si Wan.

797
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:08,547
(Exhausted)

798
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:09,677
Si Wan.

799
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,407
(Shaking his rod)

800
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:15,377
I've tried fishing on other shows...

801
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:16,807
but I've never caught anything.

802
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:18,847
(He hasn't caught a single fish in the past 25 years.)

803
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:19,907
Never?

804
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,907
(He hasn't caught a single fish in the past 25 years.)

805
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:24,307
You should move your rod around now and then.

806
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:30,577
There's one.

807
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,107
You can see through the ice...

808
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,577
You can see whether the fish is biting your bait or not.

809
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,177
You're not on my team. Be quiet.

810
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:38,707
(I forgot we were enemies.)

811
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,807
We're still neighbours.

812
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:47,307
(Will he catch a fish for the first time?)

813
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:49,107
- It's here. - Really?

814
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:50,607
I saw a fish passing.

815
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:52,007
Where?

816
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:53,777
(A Sung doesn't even know what colour trouts are.)

817
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:54,907
Where?

818
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:56,407
(Kwang Soo doesn't have any idea how to fish.)

819
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:57,507
Where did it go?

820
00:29:58,307 --> 00:29:59,407
That way.

821
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,707
Don't lie.

822
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:02,277
- Really. - That way?

823
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:03,407
(I saw it go that way.)

824
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,077
Is it really orange?

825
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:06,507
- No. - Okay.

826
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,507
- It's black. - Is it?

827
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,907
Yes, its back is black.

828
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,007
(What was I after all this time?)

829
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:15,407
Look.

830
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,077
Oh my.

831
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:20,077
(While she was gone,)

832
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,147
(fish ate all the bait.)

833
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,777
A fish ate the bait.

834
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:24,807
- What? - Really?

835
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:25,907
- Yes. - Did they?

836
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:27,007
The bait has gone.

837
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,077
(Fish are swimming around.)

838
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:31,007
(It's party time.)

839
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,707
Where was it?

840
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:35,007
It was over there.

841
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,077
Which hole?

842
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:37,807
It's the second one over there.

843
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:39,077
(Kwang Soo moves.)

844
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:42,907
(He doesn't stay in one place.)

845
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:44,877
I'm going to catch one.

846
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,507
(Waiting is important in fishing.)

847
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:51,007
(You have to wait like this.)

848
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:56,877
(He hasn't moved since he picked this hole.)

849
00:30:56,907 --> 00:31:00,207
(He's patient.)

850
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:04,607
There's no fish.

851
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:08,247
Finally.

852
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:09,507
- Take 2. - Take 1...

853
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,107
- and one more. - Eat two.

854
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:12,407
- There's no point. - Hey.

855
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,007
- It doesn't matter. - Two is too much.

856
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:15,377
- Hey. - I'll do it.

857
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,907
- I'll do it. - Stop eating.

858
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:18,347
- Stop. - Hey.

859
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:19,507
- Do it! - Go!

860
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,207
You'll break your teeth.

861
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:25,547
(Jong Kook eats the 26th lemon.)

862
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,077
(He's shaking.)

863
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:28,147
Hey.

864
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,277
Seok Jin, please don't touch.

865
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:33,777
(Take your hands off.)

866
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,607
I heard him whisper.

867
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,807
I'll tell you.

868
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,077
Gary said, "We're done."

869
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,347
I was right here.

870
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,207
Do you know what Seok Jin said?

871
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:44,977
"Let's hide one."

872
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:46,507
I was right here.

873
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,507
(He's embarrassed.)

874
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:51,407
(We're done.)

875
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:54,147
(Let's hide one.)

876
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,247
(What?)

877
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,447
How could you say that when I'm standing right here?

878
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,247
- I can't believe him. - I need the cookware.

879
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:01,307
Eat one.

880
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:05,507
(Seok Jin eats the 27th lemon.)

881
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:06,707
Oh gosh.

882
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:07,777
He takes a big one.

883
00:32:07,877 --> 00:32:10,147
- Eat it. - Take one.

884
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,347
(Haha looks like he's dancing.)

885
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:13,907
You can do it.

886
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:15,807
(Haha eats two lemons.)

887
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,907
- Stop it. - That's good.

888
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,307
(Haha eats three lemons.)

889
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:21,507
That is the last lemon.

890
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,207
He did it.

891
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:27,777
You did it.

892
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:28,807
(Team Ji Hyo wins and gets to pick first.)

893
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,777
(Team Ji Hyo: Gas burner, spoons and chopsticks)

894
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,707
(Team A Sung: Coals, grill, forks and spoons)

895
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:34,607
The second game is...

896
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:36,607
- Two-footed Basketball. - What?

897
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:39,677
You have to pick up a water bottle...

898
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,277
with your feet and throw it in the trash can.

899
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,207
Whoever puts in the most water bottles wins.

900
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,007
(Each person gets two tries.)

901
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:48,247
There's dongchimi!

902
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:49,407
Let's get rice.

903
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,507
- Shall we get rice? - Rice?

904
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:53,907
It won't be easy.

905
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,247
(Jong Kook goes first.)

906
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,407
We want instant rice.

907
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:58,307
- Do it right away. - Okay.

908
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,607
(Go!)

909
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,347
(Will he get it in on his first try?)

910
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,807
(It hits the trash can...)

911
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:13,907
(but doesn't go in.)

912
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,277
- It almost went it. - Yes.

913
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:17,607
(It was so close.)

914
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:20,777
I got the direction right but not the height.

915
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:21,877
(Jong Kook can try one more time.)

916
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:23,077
I'll try again.

917
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:26,607
(It's Jong Kook's last try.)

918
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,007
(Here it goes.)

919
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,107
(It flies high.)

920
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,077
(Will he get it in...)

921
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,077
(or not?)

922
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,407
- That's it! - It's in.

923
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:46,407
(Goal!)

924
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,877
(Team Ji Hyo 1 : 0 Team A Sung)

925
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:52,407
(That was awesome.)

926
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:54,277
- That's great. - He got it in on the last try.

927
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,077
You can do it.

928
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:57,607
- Do it. - No, not yet.

929
00:33:57,877 --> 00:33:59,407
- Not now. - It's windy.

930
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:01,007
- No. - Wait.

931
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,377
- Wait. - Go get some air

932
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,807
You dried squid.

933
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,077
(Oh man.)

934
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,777
- Okay. - Do it.

935
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,377
- Do it. - It won't go in.

936
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,417
- Do it. - It won't go in.

937
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,917
(Here it goes.)

938
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:14,807
(Will it go in or...)

939
00:34:14,877 --> 00:34:16,607
(not?)

940
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:17,877
- It won't go in. - Do it properly.

941
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:18,877
(It barely misses.)

942
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:21,777
- It won't go in. - Do it properly.

943
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,707
(It didn't go in.)

944
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:25,277
- What a shame! - That was so close.

945
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,417
- That was really close. - They are good.

946
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:30,147
(Haha's last try.)

947
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,917
(He is nervous.)

948
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,247
You have to wait for the right moment.

949
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,177
- You have to wait for that. - Okay.

950
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:38,347
- It's not time yet. - I know.

951
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:39,707
- You have to wait. - Okay.

952
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,417
- It's here. - It's now.

953
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:43,807
You have to do it now. In 1, 2, 3.

954
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:46,507
(Gary distracts Haha.)

955
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:48,447
(Haha gets distracted.)

956
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,077
(Haha fails both times.)

957
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,247
Gary.

958
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,307
(I will remember this.)

959
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:56,107
Gary.

960
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:58,177
Gary, you have to get it.

961
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,347
Haha was distracted.

962
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:01,977
Jong Kook.

963
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:04,977
- Is is Eagle Five? - It's "Squid Alien".

964
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,077
(That's funny.)

965
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,507
Don't put it too close to my ears.

966
00:35:09,677 --> 00:35:10,607
(Haha tries to distract Gary.)

967
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,307
It's windy.

968
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,507
Squid, squid, squid

969
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:16,607
Gary should sing this song.

970
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,177
- This song's perfect for you. - You should...

971
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:19,877
- shoot a squid commercial. - It's perfect.

972
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:22,777
I'll get in it the first time.

973
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:25,347
(Gary is ready.)

974
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:26,917
(Missed)

975
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:29,777
(It doesn't go in.)

976
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:33,007
(Gary was distracted by the "Squid Alien" song.)

977
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:35,917
Seok Jin, you have to put both bottles in.

978
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:37,077
How?

979
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:38,807
(Seok Jin has to succeed twice.)

980
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:41,707
(Will I be able to do it?)

981
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:43,307
- We lost. We already lost. - Yes.

982
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,807
- Okay. - We can still eat dongchimi.

983
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:48,177
- Right. - I can cook rice.

984
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,307
(We'll just eat what we have.)

985
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:50,377
We have some rice.

986
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:52,777
- That's it! - That's it!

987
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,007
(Goal!)

988
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:56,347
(Seok Jin made it!)

989
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:58,607
- He did it! - I did it!

990
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,007
(Team Ji Hyo 1 : 1 Team A Sung)

991
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:01,107
You're good.

992
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,607
(If he makes it, Team A Sung wins.)

993
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:05,607
Please.

994
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:07,977
Will we lose again?

995
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,247
It's hard.

996
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,377
It's not easy.

997
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,807
(He throws it.)

998
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,507
(Will Seok Jin...)

999
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,777
(succeed or...)

1000
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:22,007
(fail?)

1001
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,607
(Goal!)

1002
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:30,007
(It's a miracle.)

1003
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:36,507
(Can we eat delicious food?)

1004
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:38,917
He got an award last year.

1005
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,247
So he must be lucky this year.

1006
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:41,917
(The award must be his lucky charm.)

1007
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,007
It's cold.

1008
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:46,007
- We should play this game more. - Yes.

1009
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:47,107
Right.

1010
00:36:47,347 --> 00:36:49,347
- We shouldn't do brain teasers. - Take it.

1011
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,417
I'll take this.

1012
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:51,607
(Choosing food)

1013
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:52,607
Shall I take kimchi?

1014
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,377
- Hey. - Dongchimi is too cold.

1015
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:55,977
- Okay. - We need kimchi.

1016
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,307
- I want dongchimi. - Me too.

1017
00:36:58,377 --> 00:36:59,777
- I really want it. - Me too.

1018
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,277
- It's great. - That's awesome.

1019
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,007
- Do you want to switch? - I want dongchimi.

1020
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:04,107
- Shall we switch? - No.

1021
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:05,777
- I wanted dongchimi. - Really.

1022
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,007
- That's what I wanted. - Me too.

1023
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:08,447
- Really. - We need kimchi.

1024
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,917
- I wanted dongchimi too. - I'll eat one now.

1025
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,247
Dongchimi's delicious in winter.

1026
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:15,107
- Of course. - I'll get frozen in winter.

1027
00:37:15,177 --> 00:37:16,417
Why do I feel like we lost?

1028
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,007
(Why do I feel like we lost?)

1029
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:19,677
(Team Ji Hyo: Sausages, dongchimi, hot chocolate and rice)

1030
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,007
(Team A Sung: Kimchi, ice cream, instant rice and water.)

1031
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:27,307
(So far, both teams caught no fish. They have 20 minutes left.)

1032
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:31,107
(Without any fish, we might starve.)

1033
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:35,007
Look at this.

1034
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:37,007
(It's moving.)

1035
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,107
I got a bite.

1036
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:39,807
You have to pull it up!

1037
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,607
(Fish eats the bait and leaves.)

1038
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,417
It's gone.

1039
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,077
- What? - It's gone.

1040
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:48,607
- Did you lose it? - Did it eat the bait?

1041
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:49,707
Yes.

1042
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:51,277
That's good.

1043
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:53,417
What are you saying?

1044
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:55,507
How could you say that?

1045
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,807
- What? - That's not nice.

1046
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,207
(It's because I haven't caught anything.)

1047
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:04,177
(He stares at the hole.)

1048
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:06,917
I got it!

1049
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:07,977
- I got it! - Really?

1050
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:10,347
(Really?)

1051
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,417
Really?

1052
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,417
Did you really?

1053
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:13,707
I got it!

1054
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:19,507
(Will there be a fish?)

1055
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,917
I've never caught...

1056
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,507
a fish during a shoot.

1057
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:24,977
There's no fish.

1058
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,607
A fish just went by.

1059
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,147
- It's for real. - I got it.

1060
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,917
(There's a trout.)

1061
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:38,007
(It's a trout.)

1062
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:41,147
(It's a big one.)

1063
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,007
(How lucky!)

1064
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,007
Hee Jun!

1065
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:48,777
- Wow! - I got it!

1066
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:50,417
- Wow! - Look at this.

1067
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:52,177
(Jae Seok catches a fish on television.)

1068
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,917
(Jae Seok has never caught any fish on television ...)

1069
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,707
I think I caught something!

1070
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:02,507
(even though he has been on so many shows.)

1071
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,877
- Finally! - Kwang Soo!

1072
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,247
Kwang Soo.

1073
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:07,417
(He's so touched.)

1074
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,877
- I'll put it over there. - Okay.

1075
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:09,917
- Bring it. - Take it.

1076
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,917
I can't believe this.

1077
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:16,417
This is amazing.

1078
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,977
I think we could fill up to 5kg.

1079
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:21,417
(Hee Jun comes over...)

1080
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,507
That's huge.

1081
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,607
I know.

1082
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:24,977
(to congratulate Jae Seok.)

1083
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,077
This is amazing.

1084
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:28,607
- Look. - That's awesome.

1085
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:29,807
I'm so happy.

1086
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:31,607
- So it is possible to catch one! - Yes, I'm so happy.

1087
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,777
- That's great. - Wow.

1088
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:34,877
(You're so lucky.)

1089
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,607
You can do it.

1090
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,917
Oh my!

1091
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,277
I got it! I got it!

1092
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,707
(Suddenly?)

1093
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:44,807
- I got it! - What is it?

1094
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,307
(Did he really catch one?)

1095
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:47,377
- What? - Wow.

1096
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:48,877
He got it.

1097
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,507
(He caught a fish.)

1098
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:51,917
Kwang Soo.

1099
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:53,077
Catch it quickly.

1100
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,377
I got it!

1101
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:57,147
- I got it! - Good job!

1102
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,577
- It's really big. - There they are.

1103
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,777
Si Wan, there are a lot over here.

1104
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:04,607
(He wants to catch a big fish.)

1105
00:40:04,707 --> 00:40:06,207
Just wait for them like this.

1106
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:07,877
(Maybe I'll get to catch a big one.)

1107
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:10,807
(There is none.)

1108
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:11,917
This is not going as planned.

1109
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,917
(Should I just move to a different place?)

1110
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,807
- A Sung. - Yes.

1111
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,417
- Take an artificial bait and... - Okay.

1112
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,417
- An artificial one? - move it up and down near...

1113
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:25,807
the bottom of the lake.

1114
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,917
I've never caught a fish before.

1115
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:29,807
I see why people go fishing.

1116
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,107
I could feel the fish biting the bait.

1117
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:33,307
- Right? - This is fun.

1118
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,417
My fishing pole just wouldn't stop moving.

1119
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,107
(He's gained confidence.)

1120
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,007
(Of all people Kwang Soo caught me.)

1121
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,107
- Si Wan. - Yes.

1122
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,007
You have to move it slowly.

1123
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,507
You have to move it?

1124
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,207
- Otherwise, they... - Right.

1125
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:48,007
- won't bite. - I got it.

1126
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:51,577
(But...)

1127
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:56,417
(he was so confident about his fishing skills before.)

1128
00:40:56,507 --> 00:41:01,807
- This bait isn't good enough. - Really?

1129
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:03,917
I see why people go fishing.

1130
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,417
(How is Kwang Soo doing better than me?)

1131
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,507
- I just lowered it... - Right.

1132
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:08,917
- and it was just sucked in. - I see.

1133
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:10,917
I must not be doing it right.

1134
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:12,107
(And now Kwang Soo is next to him.)

1135
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:13,417
I live to go fishing.

1136
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:15,207
Now that I've caught one...

1137
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,917
(Kwang Soo says he lives to go fishing.)

1138
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,207
(Someone blows a whistle.)

1139
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:20,807
There are fish over here.

1140
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:21,917
(The fishing time is over.)

1141
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,417
Oh, no.

1142
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:25,577
Oh, no.

1143
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,417
Let me catch just one.

1144
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,507
Give me just 10 more minutes.

1145
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:32,577
I can see the fish going by.

1146
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:35,507
I even felt the fish bite.

1147
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:37,917
Hee Jun, do you want to come back here tomorrow?

1148
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,007
Do you want to?

1149
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:40,207
(He's disappointed.)

1150
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:43,207
(Ji Hyo's family and A Sung's...)

1151
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:45,007
(family each caught one fish.)

1152
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,107
We're done.

1153
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,807
Yes, it's boiling.

1154
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,707
We're done. We prepared the food.

1155
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:58,917
- This isn't our house. - I mean...

1156
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,207
We're back.

1157
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,307
- Right. - Hey.

1158
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:03,007
Welcome back. Did you catch anything?

1159
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:04,107
Did you catch anything?

1160
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,807
- We got trouts. - Really?

1161
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:07,707
- Yes. - It's slippery.

1162
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,007
- We caught a lot. - Hey.

1163
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,807
- We just have to grill this, right? - Right.

1164
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,507
You can just grill it right away.

1165
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:14,917
- Just grill it, right? - Put it on here.

1166
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,007
Where do I put it?

1167
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:18,917
Over here?

1168
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,007
- Is this how you do it? - You...

1169
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,417
- haven't done this before, right? - On the bottom.

1170
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,607
Isn't this how you do it?

1171
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,207
- No, I don't like camping. - This...

1172
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:26,307
This is...

1173
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:27,917
I think you put it here.

1174
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,417
- What is this? - It's okay. What is this called?

1175
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,417
We have budaejjigae and seafood soup.

1176
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:33,007
Wow, you prepared a lot.

1177
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:34,707
But it's not very good because we made it.

1178
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,577
I can already tell...

1179
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:38,507
that it's going to be bland.

1180
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,607
Why are you so bad at cooking?

1181
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:42,577
(At this rate, the food will never be ready.)

1182
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,007
- How is it? - What on earth is this?

1183
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:45,507
- It's really bad. - What is this?

1184
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,507
We can't fix it by just boiling it.

1185
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:49,417
Do you have any more ingredients?

1186
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,007
We don't.

1187
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,417
You put the noodles in too early.

1188
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,807
Try this.

1189
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:55,917
(Ji Hyo is using a strong double gas burner.)

1190
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,307
Look at the lid.

1191
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,777
- This is amazing. - Wow, it's boiling.

1192
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:01,917
- Wow. - Wow.

1193
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,707
(It's boiling.)

1194
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:04,917
It looks really good.

1195
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:06,207
This is unbelievable.

1196
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:07,307
This is amazing.

1197
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,507
(They are jealous.)

1198
00:43:09,307 --> 00:43:11,507
- Wow. - Ours isn't boiling.

1199
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,007
It's like lava.

1200
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:14,417
- We should try it. - This looks good.

1201
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,207
- Goodness. - Let's just go to sleep.

1202
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:19,007
- Let's... - Ours isn't boiling.

1203
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,417
Eat this first.

1204
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:22,917
Hey, can you lend us your gas burner?

1205
00:43:23,607 --> 00:43:26,307
How long do we have to wait?

1206
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,417
(It looks it's going to take a while.)

1207
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:29,707
(Ji Hyo's family has a secret ingredient.)

1208
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,207
Just put it all in.

1209
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,707
- Right. - Yes.

1210
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:34,417
- Red chili pepper paste. - You don't have any?

1211
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,507
(Ji Hyo is busy cooking.)

1212
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,417
Ji Hyo is showing her feminine side, for a change.

1213
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:39,507
- Right. - No, this is nothing.

1214
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:41,707
- Wow, it's been such a long time. - It's been a long time.

1215
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,107
- Now... - She's putting the ingredients in.

1216
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,407
- She's such a good cook. - She's using garlic.

1217
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,007
- What do you think? - Good.

1218
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:49,407
I put the garlic in.

1219
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,407
Wow.

1220
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:52,507
- How is it? - Yes.

1221
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,707
(With the gas burner, Ji Hyo cooks better.)

1222
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:54,807
This is amazing.

1223
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:56,007
(She's finished preparing the feast.)

1224
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,577
Can't we start eating now?

1225
00:43:57,607 --> 00:43:58,707
(Kwang Soo wants to start eating.)

1226
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:00,907
We have plates over here.

1227
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,007
This soup is very good.

1228
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,107
It's good, right?

1229
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,707
I can't believe how good it is.

1230
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:08,607
Later, let's put noodles in the soup.

1231
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,677
Go on. Try it.

1232
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:13,107
We're still cooking, but they...

1233
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:15,707
They're already full.

1234
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:18,507
We've been cooking for an hour now.

1235
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,207
For goodness' sake.

1236
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,707
The noodles are still not boiling.

1237
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:25,777
Why didn't you win the gas burner instead of this?

1238
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:27,307
Try playing the game yourself.

1239
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:28,807
Oh, come on.

1240
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:30,907
I didn't know it would be this important.

1241
00:44:31,307 --> 00:44:33,407
For how long do we have to light the fire?

1242
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:34,707
Goodness.

1243
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:36,507
Why is this so hard to do?

1244
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,207
Are you a boy scout?

1245
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,407
What?

1246
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:40,507
What is that?

1247
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,577
Oh no, I'm dizzy.

1248
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:45,307
- I'm dizzy. - Why are you dizzy?

1249
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:46,907
- What's wrong. - The gas.

1250
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:48,007
- Did you inhale the gas? - I'm so dizzy.

1251
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,007
- Hey, Gary. - What?

1252
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,507
- Here, drink this. - I'm dizzy.

1253
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:52,707
- It's dongchimi soup. - Okay.

1254
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:54,007
- This is really good. - Wow, we had that?

1255
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,507
Why don't we have dongchimi?

1256
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:56,607
We don't?

1257
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,407
(The soup revitalised him.)

1258
00:44:58,607 --> 00:44:59,607
- Is it good? - Do you...

1259
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:00,707
want to try the dongchimi?

1260
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:01,807
(Jong Kook brings the dongchimi.)

1261
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,307
Yes.

1262
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:05,607
Here, try it. You'll be able to eat a lot more...

1263
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:06,807
after you drink this.

1264
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:08,807
(He's amazed.)

1265
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:14,307
This is unbelievable.

1266
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:17,207
Here, you have to drink a lot of it.

1267
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:20,307
- It gives you energy. - Right.

1268
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:21,907
All right. I'm ready for anything.

1269
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,307
(He is energised.)

1270
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:24,707
- I feel like a new man. - Stop.

1271
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:27,007
Everything goes so smoothly for us.

1272
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,807
Please stop eating the budaejjigae.

1273
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,807
- Right. - We have other food as well.

1274
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:33,677
Okay. Goodness.

1275
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:34,807
Just give it to our neighbours.

1276
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:35,907
All right.

1277
00:45:36,907 --> 00:45:38,207
(That made them angry.)

1278
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:40,007
They are annoying.

1279
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,207
(Nothing seems to be going their way.)

1280
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:42,607
- Wow. - What is this?

1281
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:43,907
- Isn't this trout? - This is trout sashimi.

1282
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,107
- Wow. - It looks like salmon.

1283
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:46,707
It looks just like salmon.

1284
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:48,107
Is it sashimi?

1285
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:50,207
- Let's try it. - Do you think it'll be good?

1286
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:55,507
- How is it? - What's this?

1287
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:56,807
- Dongchimi. - This is tasty.

1288
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:58,307
(Jae Seok wants to eat it, too.)

1289
00:45:58,777 --> 00:45:59,777
- Here. - Thank you.

1290
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,107
(Si Wan tries the sashimi.)

1291
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:02,407
- There you go. - We don't have any kimchi.

1292
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:03,677
(He looks pleased.)

1293
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:04,807
- It's so good. - Here.

1294
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:06,607
- Kwang Soo, try it. - He doesn't want it.

1295
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,507
Or he can have it later.

1296
00:46:09,707 --> 00:46:10,807
It's good.

1297
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:12,407
Oh, my.

1298
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:14,407
So this is what a trout tastes like.

1299
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:16,707
What's wrong with our team?

1300
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:24,807
(They put more seasoning powder in order to save the soup.)

1301
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:29,307
(They put all of it in.)

1302
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:32,207
He had a habit of doing that ever since he was on "Family Outing".

1303
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:35,207
- What? - You secretly put a lot of in.

1304
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:37,207
This will taste good now.

1305
00:46:37,307 --> 00:46:38,307
(The seasoning powder saved it.)

1306
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:39,807
Look.

1307
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:41,507
It's like udon, right?

1308
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:43,207
(He's tasting the soup.)

1309
00:46:43,307 --> 00:46:44,707
It's savoury.

1310
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:46,407
- It's very savoury. - I doubt it.

1311
00:46:46,707 --> 00:46:48,607
- Taste it. - It just tastes like ramyun.

1312
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:50,677
This is a traditional flavour.

1313
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:54,107
It's just like my mother's cooking.

1314
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,607
Just like your mother's cooking.

1315
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:57,907
This is very good. A Sung, try it.

1316
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:01,107
- It's good, right? - It really is.

1317
00:47:01,407 --> 00:47:03,307
- It's astounding. - Here, Hee Jun.

1318
00:47:03,307 --> 00:47:04,577
I told you so.

1319
00:47:04,707 --> 00:47:05,807
It's really good.

1320
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:08,107
(Hee Jun approves.)

1321
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:09,407
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1322
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,507
It's really good.

1323
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:13,007
- Did you make this? - Of course I did.

1324
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:14,907
We have a good cook, too.

1325
00:47:15,107 --> 00:47:16,807
- Is it cooked now? - Let's see.

1326
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:18,107
It's ready.

1327
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:19,777
Let's check if it's done.

1328
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:21,307
- All right. - I think it's ready.

1329
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,307
- You really grilled that? - I have a good feeling about this.

1330
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,007
Wow.

1331
00:47:27,907 --> 00:47:28,907
The skin is peeled off.

1332
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:30,907
It's been peeled off.

1333
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:32,707
- Wow, it looks good. - How is it?

1334
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,807
- The skin's been peeled off. - Look.

1335
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:37,777
- Wow. - It looks good.

1336
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:39,207
(It looks really good.)

1337
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:40,407
It looks good.

1338
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:42,007
(The pink meat looks appetising.)

1339
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,007
Go ahead and eat it.

1340
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:45,507
Go on.

1341
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:46,607
(He takes a bite.)

1342
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:49,507
(How does the trout taste?)

1343
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:50,607
- How is it? - Wow.

1344
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:52,107
This is the real deal.

1345
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,207
(He's astounded.)

1346
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,207
Kwang Soo, tell us how it is.

1347
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:56,507
- It's good. - He told you it's good.

1348
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,707
Of course, it's good.

1349
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:58,807
Right. Of course, it's good.

1350
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,607
I'm telling you. It's really good.

1351
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:04,407
- This is really good. - See? It's good.

1352
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:06,007
This is really good.

1353
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:07,407
Of course, it's tasty.

1354
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:09,207
It was freshly caught.

1355
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:10,907
It was fresh, so of course it's good.

1356
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:13,307
- Wow, it's good. - Ji Hyo.

1357
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,907
- It's good. - I'm not jealous at all.

1358
00:48:15,207 --> 00:48:16,677
- Here. Try it. - It's really good.

1359
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:18,807
- It's really good. - It's delicious.

1360
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,607
I'm not lying. It's really good.

1361
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:22,107
This is way better than...

1362
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:23,407
what you guys had.

1363
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,107
- Seriously. - It's good, right?

1364
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:26,207
It's really good.

1365
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:27,407
(Everyone's in love with it.)

1366
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:28,707
It's really tasty.

1367
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:30,577
It's so flavourful.

1368
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:32,907
Si Wan, try it.

1369
00:48:32,907 --> 00:48:34,907
(Si Wan also tries the trout.)

1370
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,907
It's good, right? It's not fishy at all.

1371
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,007
(They finish eating the last bit of the grilled trout.)

1372
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:42,107
- Here. - He wants some.

1373
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:43,307
Okay. It's really good.

1374
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:44,507
You grilled it well.

1375
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:45,907
- Is the hot chocolate bad? - Hey.

1376
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,407
- It's good. - Go get some.

1377
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:49,807
- With water... - Give us some hot chocolate.

1378
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,807
You seem very confident...

1379
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:54,007
when you're making demands.

1380
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:56,107
- Give us some hot chocolate. - But he doesn't like...

1381
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:57,607
sharing his things.

1382
00:48:57,707 --> 00:48:59,677
- Give us some. - You're demanding hot chocolate.

1383
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,407
- We have nothing to lose. - What?

1384
00:49:01,577 --> 00:49:02,907
- In exchange, I'll give you water. - We don't even have a house.

1385
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:05,107
We're homeless and have nothing to lose.

1386
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:07,307
A Sung is very funny.

1387
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:08,577
Let's make a deal.

1388
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,677
Go away.

1389
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:12,107
Do you know how old she is?

1390
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,907
- No. - She's 25 years old.

1391
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:16,307
She's no longer the girl from "The Host".

1392
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:18,707
Don't people get married at that age?

1393
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:19,807
What?

1394
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:22,107
You're not even married and you're 41.

1395
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:24,407
She only 25. What are you talking about?

1396
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:26,207
I wasn't talking about me.

1397
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:29,007
- I'm talking about her. - You're 41 and still not married.

1398
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:30,707
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1399
00:49:30,807 --> 00:49:32,107
What are you doing over here?

1400
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:33,507
- Give me some hot chocolate. - What?

1401
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:35,207
Go away.

1402
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:36,407
Get out of my sight!

1403
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,507
- What? - I said, get out of my sight.

1404
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,407
- Are you kidding me? - He wants hot chocolate.

1405
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:42,307
- Let's wrap this up. - Since it's cold here,

1406
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:43,907
- should we rest inside? - Let's go.

1407
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,207
Should we go back inside?

1408
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:46,577
Since it's cold,

1409
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:47,807
let's gather around the fire.

1410
00:49:47,877 --> 00:49:49,107
(Gather around the fire.)

1411
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,907
- The fire? - Come by the fire.

1412
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,307
I brought a heater for us.

1413
00:49:55,107 --> 00:49:57,307
- Look at that. - This also works as a heater.

1414
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,507
It becomes a heater if you open it.

1415
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:02,007
Should we remove some ice in the middle...

1416
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:03,207
so the air will go inside?

1417
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:06,407
Honestly, they are so annoying.

1418
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:08,807
- Let's make a window for them. - Let's make a window for them.

1419
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:13,207
Oh my gosh!

1420
00:50:13,307 --> 00:50:14,307
(Oh my gosh!)

1421
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:16,207
Darn it!

1422
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:19,507
I stepped on the puddle again.

1423
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:21,907
- You could go around. - I soaked my feet in there.

1424
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:23,607
- What's wrong with you? - Unlucky ones are always unlucky.

1425
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:24,707
Goodness.

1426
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:26,807
Look at that!

1427
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:29,307
What?

1428
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:31,407
(Jong Kook cracks up.)

1429
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:34,907
I'm so upset.

1430
00:50:35,507 --> 00:50:36,507
I'm so upset.

1431
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:37,607
(It serves you right!)

1432
00:50:37,707 --> 00:50:38,707
I'm so upset.

1433
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:40,407
(My enemy's misfortune is my happiness.)

1434
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:41,507
Gosh.

1435
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:44,207
- That was amazing. - It's so cozy in here.

1436
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:46,277
- Because the wind is blocked. - Aren't we the sweetest siblings?

1437
00:50:46,307 --> 00:50:47,407
I know.

1438
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,907
I think I can even sleep here.

1439
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:52,107
I feel like pushing the wall from behind.

1440
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:55,007
I was going to do that, and then I dipped my foot in the puddle.

1441
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:56,807
(What will happen to these two rivalling families?)

1442
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:58,007
We should push the wall.

1443
00:50:58,507 --> 00:50:59,707
Gosh, I hate them.

1444
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:03,907
When the night fell on the cursed Running Village,

1445
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:08,107
the blizzard became even stronger.

1446
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:09,807
(Listening to that makes them colder.)

1447
00:51:09,807 --> 00:51:12,807
Seok Jin and Jong Kook...

1448
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:15,707
went to get firewood...

1449
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:19,007
so that the siblings could spend the night in warmth.

1450
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:20,277
Firewood?

1451
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:21,507
This is crazy.

1452
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:23,007
- Hurry up and leave. - Seok Jin and I?

1453
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:24,907
This is the 21st century. Where can we get the firewood?

1454
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,307
- Is it near... - What?

1455
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:28,607
Where can we get the firewood in the 21st century?

1456
00:51:28,707 --> 00:51:30,407
Why do I have to do this with Seok Jin?

1457
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:32,407
This is crazy.

1458
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:34,907
Where should we go to get the firewood?

1459
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,007
Are they actually going to get the firewood?

1460
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,307
You are my firewood!

1461
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:40,907
You are right.

1462
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,807
You are my darling pollack.

1463
00:51:43,177 --> 00:51:47,107
Seok Jin and Jong Kook didn't come back after a while.

1464
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:50,807
So Gary and Kwang Soo went to find him.

1465
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,407
- Why? - We don't need to look for them.

1466
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:54,407
They are not important to me.

1467
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:56,407
Gosh, it was just getting peaceful here.

1468
00:51:57,007 --> 00:51:59,407
- Bye, pollack and squid. - What?

1469
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:01,807
- Are we a set menu? - Yes.

1470
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:03,107
I am not a pollack though.

1471
00:52:03,507 --> 00:52:04,807
- Then am I a squid? - No.

1472
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:07,907
Squid and pollack.

1473
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:09,807
What do we do? Where are we going?

1474
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,707
(They came out, but they don't know where to go.)

1475
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:13,007
Jong Kook!

1476
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:14,907
Seok Jin!

1477
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,007
(They start to worry.)

1478
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,307
It feels like we are soon going to be scattered.

1479
00:52:19,377 --> 00:52:20,707
- It's not necessary. - We will disappear one by one.

1480
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:24,307
(They are worried.)

1481
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,407
Gary and Kwang Soo didn't come back either after a while.

1482
00:52:28,507 --> 00:52:31,807
So, Hee Jun and...

1483
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:33,307
Si Wan went to find them.

1484
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,607
- What? - Where is everyone going?

1485
00:52:37,107 --> 00:52:39,107
- I will look for them. - Come back safely.

1486
00:52:39,177 --> 00:52:40,807
- We will go look for them. - You must come back.

1487
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:41,907
- Make sure you come back. - We will find them.

1488
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:43,007
- Bye, Hee Jun. - Bye.

1489
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:44,307
- Okay. - We'll come back if we fail.

1490
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:47,477
(Hee Jun and Si Wan go to find their missing brothers.)

1491
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:50,307
- Oh, gosh. - Be careful.

1492
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:51,807
That's an ominous sign.

1493
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:52,907
(That's an ominous sign.)

1494
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:56,607
So far, who left?

1495
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,607
Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,

1496
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:01,177
- Gary, - And Gary,

1497
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:02,307
- and Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1498
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,707
Where did they go?

1499
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,407
(Where did everyone go?)

1500
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:08,907
It's so cold.

1501
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:10,507
What's going on?

1502
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:14,107
What's going on?

1503
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:16,507
What's happening?

1504
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:18,907
(They are the fairies who helped them build the igloo.)

1505
00:53:19,107 --> 00:53:22,507
(They take the two guys somewhere.)

1506
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:27,507
(Where are you taking us?)

1507
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:31,307
- It's strange. - It's warm.

1508
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:32,407
What's strange?

1509
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:34,907
Why are the brothers not back yet?

1510
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,807
I will go look for them too.

1511
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:38,007
- How about us? - How about us?

1512
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:39,377
(How about us?)

1513
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,507
- What? - What?

1514
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:42,607
Where are you going?

1515
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:45,807
- What's going on? - Are they leaving us behind?

1516
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:47,607
(What are we supposed to do now?)

1517
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:49,407
What?

1518
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:50,807
Oh, dear.

1519
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:54,207
The evil ice witch took the boys...

1520
00:53:54,307 --> 00:53:56,107
who went out to get the firewood.

1521
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:58,707
(The witch took the boys?)

1522
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:06,407
They actually tied my feet?

1523
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,007
Where is my family?

1524
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:12,407
You said this is a fairy tale!

1525
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:14,907
This is such a cruel fairy tale!

1526
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:18,907
(He's cuffed.)

1527
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:21,407
What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong to get this?

1528
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:22,407
(Si Wan tries to analyse the situation.)

1529
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:23,507
Why am I cuffed?

1530
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:26,707
(The six boys are held captive, not knowing what they did wrong.)

1531
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,107
Guys!

1532
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,507
(At that time,)

1533
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,407
(some people appear.)

1534
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:35,907
We were having a good day.

1535
00:54:35,907 --> 00:54:38,207
(Someone appears...)

1536
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:40,277
(and removes the blindfold.)

1537
00:54:40,307 --> 00:54:42,407
(Is that...)

1538
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:48,377
(a clown?)

1539
00:54:51,507 --> 00:54:52,607
What?

1540
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,107
(Without saying a word,)

1541
00:54:55,177 --> 00:54:56,207
What's this?

1542
00:54:56,307 --> 00:54:58,177
(the clowns just dance.)

1543
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,707
Are they clowns?

1544
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:04,907
Why are you taking things this far today?

1545
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:06,007
(Why are you taking things this far today?)

1546
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:08,907
What are we supposed to do?

1547
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:11,507
(Where are they? And why are they held captive?)

1548
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:13,407
We have to now start looking for them, right, A Sung?

1549
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,507
Yes.

1550
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:17,507
(A Sung, Jae Seok, Ji Hyo and Haha go to find the boys.)

1551
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:20,407
A Sung, you have to find them.

1552
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:24,707
(I need to find and rescue them.)

1553
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:30,007
It's spooky in here.

1554
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:36,907
(They pass through the witch's greenhouse and go outside.)

1555
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:38,307
(She stops.)

1556
00:55:39,177 --> 00:55:41,177
(Oh, my gosh.)

1557
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:43,607
(It's a Dark Spirit!)

1558
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:46,607
Haha! Haha!

1559
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:47,707
What is it?

1560
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:51,707
There are people wearing black masks outside.

1561
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,377
So we can't let them see us.

1562
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:55,407
We are not supposed to let them see us, right?

1563
00:55:55,507 --> 00:55:58,277
We have to be careful. Shall we stick together?

1564
00:55:58,307 --> 00:55:59,377
Shall we?

1565
00:56:03,307 --> 00:56:04,307
What?

1566
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,207
Who are they? They are so scary!

1567
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:10,007
Who are they? I'm scared!

1568
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:11,207
(I'm scared!)

1569
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:12,807
Are they the Dark Spirits?

1570
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:14,007
What do I do?

1571
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:15,107
(Will the little sisters be able to save their brothers?)

1572
00:56:15,607 --> 00:56:17,377
Wait. What's this?

1573
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:19,707
(Walking)

1574
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:20,907
What's this?

1575
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:25,207
(The clowns bring a table.)

1576
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:27,807
(It's a Korean beef meal.)

1577
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:29,807
You want me to eat that?

1578
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,207
It's Korean beef?

1579
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,107
(Korean beef?)

1580
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:34,207
(Is this a surprise Korean beef barbecue party?)

1581
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,307
Korean beef?

1582
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:39,707
They cuffed me, and now they're grilling meat in front of me.

1583
00:56:41,407 --> 00:56:44,407
What is going on today? I really have no idea.

1584
00:56:45,507 --> 00:56:47,277
(The meat is cooking nicely.)

1585
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:49,907
(He's so desperate to eat the beef.)

1586
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,007
Yes, please.

1587
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:53,507
(He desperately wants it.)

1588
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:55,407
(What is this? Will they give it to me if I beg?)

1589
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,307
Please.

1590
00:56:58,007 --> 00:57:00,707
(He eats it.)

1591
00:57:01,407 --> 00:57:02,407
Really?

1592
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:07,007
(I'm supposed to eat it?)

1593
00:57:09,507 --> 00:57:11,907
(Seok Jin eats a piece too.)

1594
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:16,607
(Kwang Soo trembles.)

1595
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,907
(He enjoys the beef.)

1596
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:24,407
It's delicious.

1597
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,407
(It's delicious.)

1598
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,407
Oh, they're actually feeding me?

1599
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:31,307
Why?

1600
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,277
Really?

1601
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:36,107
Gosh.

1602
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:37,207
(They remove the table.)

1603
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:38,307
What are you doing?

1604
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:40,807
You gave me just one piece. That's it?

1605
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,907
(Chewing)

1606
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:48,377
(They remove the table too.)

1607
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:49,707
I haven't eaten much yet.

1608
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:50,807
(I haven't eaten much yet.)

1609
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:52,107
(Why are they removing the table?)

1610
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:55,307
Gosh, it smells amazing.

1611
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:56,607
(It smells amazing.)

1612
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:58,177
(Gary eats the meat.)

1613
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:02,807
(It's amazing!)

1614
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:03,907
Please give me some more.

1615
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:05,277
(Please give me some more.)

1616
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:07,407
Why? I only got the taste of it.

1617
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:09,207
No!

1618
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:12,007
It's unbelievably delicious.

1619
00:58:12,107 --> 00:58:13,177
(The clowns remove Gary's table as well.)

1620
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:15,607
I wish I could eat a few more.

1621
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:20,377
Why did they grill the meat?

1622
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:22,507
(What is going on?)

1623
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:26,407
(Meanwhile, in the witch's garden filled with the Dark Spirits,)

1624
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:31,707
(A Sung is looking for the name tags.)

1625
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,607
They hid it somewhere too deep.

1626
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:34,807
(They hid it somewhere too deep.)

1627
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:36,507
I have to find the name tags first, right?

1628
00:58:37,477 --> 00:58:39,007
(Oh?)

1629
00:58:39,107 --> 00:58:40,377
I found it!

1630
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,407
(She found something.)

1631
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:46,407
It was in the plastic bag!

1632
00:58:46,507 --> 00:58:49,377
The evil ice witch took the boys who went...

1633
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:51,007
to get firewood.

1634
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:53,007
In order to rescue them,

1635
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,407
you must give them their name tags.

1636
00:58:55,507 --> 00:58:56,607
(They have to find empty name tags and write their names.)

1637
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:58,207
Somewhere in the garden,

1638
00:58:58,307 --> 00:59:01,407
there is the Witch's Door, which will take you...

1639
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:03,007
back to the village and lift its curse.

1640
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,707
So you must open the Witch's Door with your brothers and...

1641
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,107
return home.

1642
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:11,007
But the door only opens once.

1643
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:15,407
So you have to find it and open it before the other family finds it.

1644
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,207
As soon as they heard what the Winter Fairy said,

1645
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:21,107
Ji Hyo and A Sung...

1646
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:23,407
hurriedly left for the witch's garden...

1647
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:27,907
with their brothers.

1648
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:30,407
Will they be able to...

1649
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:33,607
escape this place together?

1650
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,307
(Which name will A Sung write on the first name tag she found?)

1651
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:42,407
Hee Jun.

1652
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:46,177
(It's Hee Jun, who's been taking good care of her all day.)

1653
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:49,677
(Now she has to find him and put it on him to rescue him.)

1654
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:51,907
Those Dark Spirits.

1655
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:56,407
(Jae Seok is trying hard to find the name tag too.)

1656
00:59:56,477 --> 00:59:57,607
(Where is the name tag?)

1657
00:59:58,107 --> 00:59:59,107
What is this?

1658
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:00,207
(Running towards Jae Seok)

1659
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:02,607
(Jae Seok is surrounded by the Dark Spirits.)

1660
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:05,207
(Wait, this laugh...)

1661
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:06,707
(sounds familiar.)

1662
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:08,407
(Wait,)

1663
01:00:08,507 --> 01:00:10,777
(this is Yun Hwa.)

1664
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,977
(Why is she here?)

1665
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,107
An ice witch cast an evil spell...

1666
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:19,807
on the once warm and peaceful Running Village.

1667
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,507
(Yun Hwa was the one who welcomed the members to the village.)

1668
01:00:24,507 --> 01:00:27,807
(But it turns out that Yun Hwa was the ice witch.

1669
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:33,507
(All of the traps were set up by the ice witch, Yun Hwa.)

1670
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,777
What am I supposed to do?

1671
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:40,407
I'm going to destroy everything. I'm coming at you.

1672
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:45,707
Wait.

1673
01:00:46,507 --> 01:00:47,507
Ice witch,

1674
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:49,907
what's going on?

1675
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:52,307
Dark Spirits, turn him around.

1676
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:53,407
Wait a second.

1677
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:55,807
(The ice witch has control over all the spirits.)

1678
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:56,877
Look.

1679
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:00,607
Yu Jae Seok.

1680
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,977
Wait.

1681
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:03,907
(She ripped off his name tag.)

1682
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,107
(The unexpected attack of the ice witch...)

1683
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:10,507
(puts Jae Seok into the ice prison.)

1684
01:01:12,307 --> 01:01:16,407
(How are the captured members doing?)

1685
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:17,607
My goodness.

1686
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:21,707
(They're serving him beef again.)

1687
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:22,807
What are they up to?

1688
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:26,307
(Grilling the beef)

1689
01:01:27,507 --> 01:01:29,207
(Jong Kook opens his mouth.)

1690
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,207
They're letting me eat.

1691
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:34,107
(After one bite,)

1692
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:35,807
(the table is taken away.)

1693
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:37,107
Why are they doing this all of a sudden?

1694
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:39,107
(The table is taken away after one bite.)

1695
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:40,207
And they leave?

1696
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,507
(What's going on?)

1697
01:01:43,107 --> 01:01:45,407
Here we go. We have the beef.

1698
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,777
That's enough.

1699
01:01:48,807 --> 01:01:49,807
(They're even making a wrap for him.)

1700
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:55,007
(Yum)

1701
01:01:57,807 --> 01:02:00,707
They're making me crave for more.

1702
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:02,207
Look at that.

1703
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:03,607
That looks amazing.

1704
01:02:03,907 --> 01:02:05,007
You know how to grill beef.

1705
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,207
Red on the inside,

1706
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:08,977
brown on the outside.

1707
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:10,107
(The smell of the beef made him forget about his mission.)

1708
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:16,607
This is delicious.

1709
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:21,007
Thank you.

1710
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:23,107
Thank you.

1711
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,007
(Munching)

1712
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:31,607
Where are you going?

1713
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,707
(Where are you going?)

1714
01:02:34,777 --> 01:02:36,407
(I want some more.)

1715
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:42,607
(It's Si Wan's turn.)

1716
01:02:42,707 --> 01:02:44,507
(The beef is being grilled.)

1717
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:47,607
At a certain time,

1718
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:49,907
they come in with a table...

1719
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:52,907
and serve me beef.

1720
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:56,977
(Then...)

1721
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:02,507
(there must be something special about the beef.)

1722
01:03:04,707 --> 01:03:05,807
I'm okay.

1723
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:07,207
(I'm okay.)

1724
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:08,207
I'm too full.

1725
01:03:08,307 --> 01:03:09,507
I don't want to eat.

1726
01:03:10,107 --> 01:03:11,107
I'm okay.

1727
01:03:11,307 --> 01:03:12,507
I'm not going to eat.

1728
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:15,707
(Disappointed)

1729
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:18,877
(There must be something going on.)

1730
01:03:22,707 --> 01:03:24,007
I'm too full. I can't eat.

1731
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,607
I'm okay.

1732
01:03:25,777 --> 01:03:27,507
I'm really okay.

1733
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:28,707
(Determined)

1734
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:29,807
I'm full.

1735
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:30,877
I ate too much.

1736
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,107
I ate too much.

1737
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:36,607
(The clowns leave the table behind.)

1738
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:39,107
(What's going on?)

1739
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:41,907
(Why are they clapping their hands?)

1740
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:45,507
Is this it?

1741
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:49,107
(The clown releases Si Wan's left arm.)

1742
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:51,307
There you go.

1743
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,407
(Si Wan's left arm is released.)

1744
01:03:52,507 --> 01:03:54,007
Thank you.

1745
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:55,507
(Si Wan's left arm is released.)

1746
01:03:56,307 --> 01:03:57,307
Right.

1747
01:03:58,507 --> 01:03:59,507
Right.

1748
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:02,107
You're supposed to resist. You shouldn't eat.

1749
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:03,307
(You're supposed to resist. You shouldn't eat.)

1750
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,407
(Grilling)

1751
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,307
(Tempted)

1752
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:13,307
Am I supposed to resist to be released?

1753
01:04:15,107 --> 01:04:16,107
Then I'm not eating.

1754
01:04:16,907 --> 01:04:19,307
(Are you sure?)

1755
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:20,807
(Agonising)

1756
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,877
That looks amazing. It must be high-quality beef.

1757
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,007
It smells so good.

1758
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:29,407
(It's hard to resist the high-quality beef.)

1759
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:32,207
(Frustrated)

1760
01:04:32,307 --> 01:04:34,607
(Sighing)

1761
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:38,007
It's so hard to resist.

1762
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:41,107
There must be something behind it.

1763
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:42,207
(The smell weakens him.)

1764
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:44,707
Maybe one more bite.

1765
01:04:44,807 --> 01:04:45,807
(I can't resist any longer.)

1766
01:04:45,907 --> 01:04:47,607
(Seok Jin gobbles up the beef.)

1767
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:52,907
(As expected, the clowns take the table away.)

1768
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:54,507
What's going on?

1769
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:55,807
(He now knows the beef tastes good...)

1770
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:59,107
(but has no idea what's going on.)

1771
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,607
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok has been sent to the ice prison.)

1772
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:07,707
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

1773
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:09,207
I'll rescue you.

1774
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:10,607
A Sung,

1775
01:05:11,877 --> 01:05:12,877
do you have a name tag?

1776
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:15,107
I'll give you a name tag.

1777
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,107
(A Sung is trying to rescue Jae Seok with the name tag she found.)

1778
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:22,007
(She changes the name from "Hee Jun" to "Jae Seok".)

1779
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:24,107
Thank you, A Sung.

1780
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:26,607
(Jae Seok is released.)

1781
01:05:26,707 --> 01:05:28,207
Let's look for name tags.

1782
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,507
They must be somewhere around there.

1783
01:05:29,507 --> 01:05:31,507
- Where? - We should run away.

1784
01:05:31,607 --> 01:05:32,607
Let's run.

1785
01:05:32,707 --> 01:05:34,007
(They hurriedly set out to find name tags.)

1786
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:45,107
(Ji Hyo found a name tag and a pen.)

1787
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:49,007
(I have to rescue my brothers.)

1788
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:57,407
(She found another one.)

1789
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:04,307
(After Si Wan passed the first stage,)

1790
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,407
(the clown brought a tablet computer.)

1791
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:08,207
Okay, I got it.

1792
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:22,007
(This video clip is famous for making the viewer laugh.)

1793
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:29,677
(Why are they showing this to me?)

1794
01:06:29,677 --> 01:06:35,707
(Am I supposed to laugh or not?)

1795
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:44,107
(It becomes harder and harder to hold back a laugh.)

1796
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:52,007
(This is a torture.)

1797
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,207
I watched this play once.

1798
01:06:57,077 --> 01:07:00,607
They have fun with clowns at first but then it starts to turn creepy.

1799
01:07:00,977 --> 01:07:02,307
This reminds me of that play.

1800
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:05,007
You eat.

1801
01:07:05,607 --> 01:07:06,977
If I eat, you'll stop.

1802
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,607
You eat.

1803
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:10,107
You can eat.

1804
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:11,807
Si Wan!

1805
01:07:13,307 --> 01:07:14,977
Where are you, A Sung?

1806
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:16,877
Jae Seok!

1807
01:07:18,607 --> 01:07:19,677
(Tempted)

1808
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:21,777
I'm fine. I'm full.

1809
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:23,207
I'm full.

1810
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,607
I'm not going to eat.

1811
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:27,407
I'm not going to eat.

1812
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:34,407
(This time, Seok Jin resisted.)

1813
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,107
(His left arm is released.)

1814
01:07:36,207 --> 01:07:37,207
What's going on?

1815
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,407
(His left arm is released.)

1816
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:40,207
Are you releasing me?

1817
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:42,777
Are you?

1818
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:46,307
(Once they resist the beef, they pass the first stage.)

1819
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,307
What did I do?

1820
01:07:48,507 --> 01:07:52,007
Am I supposed to not listen to them?

1821
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:56,507
(I have to resist.)

1822
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:57,977
That looks fantastic.

1823
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,907
(I have to resist.)

1824
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:08,407
They're torturing me.

1825
01:08:12,307 --> 01:08:17,907
(Kwang Soo held out.)

1826
01:08:17,977 --> 01:08:20,907
(His left arm is released.)

1827
01:08:20,977 --> 01:08:23,777
Are you releasing me? So I was supposed to resist?

1828
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:25,507
Was that the mission?

1829
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:27,407
(That was it.)

1830
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:32,007
They wouldn't feed me for no reason.

1831
01:08:34,717 --> 01:08:38,107
(Once he passed the first stage, they make him watch the clip.)

1832
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:46,217
(It's the laugh-inducing clip again.)

1833
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:52,217
(He bursts into laughter as soon as the clip starts.)

1834
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,107
(Hee Jun also...)

1835
01:09:01,107 --> 01:09:03,717
(cracks up at the clip.)

1836
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,807
(Giggling)

1837
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:12,907
(Am I supposed to laugh with them?)

1838
01:09:15,507 --> 01:09:17,607
(Smiling)

1839
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:21,107
(The smile is gone.)

1840
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:23,007
What is it now?

1841
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:25,217
(What is it now?)

1842
01:09:25,217 --> 01:09:26,217
Let me see.

1843
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:31,007
(These two are still eating.)

1844
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,007
It's hot.

1845
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:36,107
(These two are still eating.)

1846
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:41,507
(While looking for name tags,)

1847
01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:43,217
(Haha found Si Wan.)

1848
01:09:43,307 --> 01:09:44,717
- Why are you here? - Haha.

1849
01:09:45,007 --> 01:09:46,107
- What's happening? - Haha.

1850
01:09:46,507 --> 01:09:47,507
Why are you here?

1851
01:09:47,777 --> 01:09:48,777
It seems like...

1852
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:51,607
I'm supposed to hold back my laugh watching this.

1853
01:09:53,507 --> 01:09:54,507
Don't laugh.

1854
01:09:54,877 --> 01:09:56,607
Don't laugh.

1855
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,717
- I'll find the name tag, okay? - Then I'll be free.

1856
01:09:57,807 --> 01:09:59,307
- What smells so good? - Let's go together.

1857
01:09:59,407 --> 01:10:01,307
I was being tortured with beef.

1858
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,007
- I'll bring it. Stay here. - Yes.

1859
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:05,807
(Haha leaves to find the name tag.)

1860
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:08,217
(Si Wan has to hold back his laughter.)

1861
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:13,607
(He keeps a straight face.)

1862
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:17,607
(He's determined.)

1863
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:20,377
(He doesn't even move.)

1864
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:24,717
(I won't laugh.)

1865
01:10:24,907 --> 01:10:27,007
(He's so good.)

1866
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:29,807
(The video is almost over.)

1867
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:31,507
(He makes it until the end.)

1868
01:10:32,217 --> 01:10:34,307
(He finished watching it.)

1869
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:37,217
(Great job!)

1870
01:10:40,507 --> 01:10:42,607
I did it.

1871
01:10:42,717 --> 01:10:44,607
(His right arm is free.)

1872
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:47,717
(He laughs.)

1873
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:50,407
Can I laugh now? Show me again.

1874
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:51,717
He's so funny.

1875
01:10:53,407 --> 01:10:56,407
(The old man is the funniest.)

1876
01:10:56,477 --> 01:10:58,607
His laugh is so funny.

1877
01:11:00,107 --> 01:11:01,307
He almost...

1878
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:03,607
made me laugh.

1879
01:11:03,607 --> 01:11:05,407
I can get up now.

1880
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:06,577
(Now he laughs.)

1881
01:11:06,677 --> 01:11:07,717
That old man...

1882
01:11:07,907 --> 01:11:09,007
was so funny.

1883
01:11:09,677 --> 01:11:10,717
They're here again.

1884
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:13,307
(The clowns walk in again.)

1885
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:16,907
(What is it this time?)

1886
01:11:20,607 --> 01:11:21,807
(He drops something.)

1887
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:28,607
(What? Scissors?)

1888
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:32,807
They gave me scissors.

1889
01:11:33,607 --> 01:11:35,807
(Scissors can cut...)

1890
01:11:35,907 --> 01:11:39,477
(this rope, can't they?)

1891
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:42,807
These are for cutting.

1892
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:44,407
The clowns left.

1893
01:11:44,507 --> 01:11:46,807
(They gave me the scissors to cut the rope.)

1894
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:49,807
I won't use these...

1895
01:11:49,907 --> 01:11:51,217
until they come back.

1896
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:52,407
(I won't use these until they come back.)

1897
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:56,907
(He kicks them.)

1898
01:11:57,807 --> 01:12:03,407
(I won't fall for you tricks again.)

1899
01:12:05,507 --> 01:12:06,677
Si Wan.

1900
01:12:06,717 --> 01:12:07,907
Si Wan, I'll save you.

1901
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:09,807
Where's the name tag?

1902
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,007
(Trust me.)

1903
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:14,007
Okay.

1904
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:17,807
(Haha finds the name tag.)

1905
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:19,107
I'll keep it.

1906
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:21,607
If they notice, I'll use it.

1907
01:12:21,607 --> 01:12:23,007
If not, I'll save him. Okay?

1908
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:25,217
Okay.

1909
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:29,007
(The clowns are back.)

1910
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:32,507
(I didn't fall into your trap.)

1911
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:40,107
(Why is he still tied up?)

1912
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:43,307
(Was I supposed to use the scissors?)

1913
01:12:47,307 --> 01:12:50,377
(They give him a new pair of scissors.)

1914
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,607
(Do you want me to cut it?)

1915
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:59,717
(The clowns exit again.)

1916
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:02,607
I'll try one more time.

1917
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:03,607
(I'll try one more time.)

1918
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:07,217
If they bring me scissors again,

1919
01:13:07,377 --> 01:13:08,907
then I'll run away.

1920
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:15,807
(He hides the scissors in the cameraman's pocket.)

1921
01:13:18,807 --> 01:13:20,907
(He goes back to the chair.)

1922
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,407
(What will you do now?)

1923
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:30,477
(They gave him another pair of scissors.)

1924
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:32,807
What?

1925
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:35,007
(What do you want me to do?)

1926
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:37,717
(Do you want me to cut the rope?)

1927
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:41,107
(They take a bow.)

1928
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,407
(They exit again.)

1929
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:44,607
Okay.

1930
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,507
They told me to cut it. I'll cut it.

1931
01:13:50,607 --> 01:13:51,607
(I'll cut it.)

1932
01:13:51,717 --> 01:13:53,807
(Snipping)

1933
01:13:56,717 --> 01:13:58,907
(Wow)

1934
01:14:00,507 --> 01:14:04,217
(What's going on?)

1935
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:06,807
(Did I pass?)

1936
01:14:09,107 --> 01:14:10,907
- Go, go! - Go, go!

1937
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:13,007
(Si Wan is free.)

1938
01:14:13,107 --> 01:14:14,717
You actually gave me the scissors.

1939
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:16,107
You...

1940
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:18,407
tied me up.

1941
01:14:19,677 --> 01:14:21,217
- Are you free? - Yes.

1942
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:23,507
- Thank you. - What happened?

1943
01:14:23,607 --> 01:14:24,807
- Well. - Hey,

1944
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:26,907
- I got this for you. - What?

1945
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:29,677
You know...

1946
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:31,717
I don't usually do this.

1947
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,807
I usually...

1948
01:14:33,217 --> 01:14:35,907
keep things to myself.

1949
01:14:36,507 --> 01:14:38,607
I'll give it to you because I like you.

1950
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,907
Do you know that?

1951
01:14:41,717 --> 01:14:43,377
- Thank you. - You are...

1952
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:45,907
the first-ever guest to start the race.

1953
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,377
I don't want you dying right away.

1954
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:50,217
- Okay. - Do you understand?

1955
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:51,607
- I'll give this to you, okay? - I will...

1956
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:53,217
rip two name tags, then I'll get mine ripped off.

1957
01:14:53,377 --> 01:14:54,577
I'll rip two name tags.

1958
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,907
I'll rip at least two name tags.

1959
01:14:57,477 --> 01:15:00,217
(Yim Si Wan)

1960
01:15:01,407 --> 01:15:02,507
That's what I'm saying.

1961
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:04,407
That's weird.

1962
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:06,717
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1963
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:07,907
(I can't believe I'm doing this.)

1964
01:15:08,307 --> 01:15:09,407
Let's go.

1965
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:10,607
Let's go.

1966
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:12,307
All right.

1967
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:14,217
Show them what you got.

1968
01:15:14,307 --> 01:15:15,377
Let's go.

1969
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:25,407
(These two are eating.)

1970
01:15:27,007 --> 01:15:30,007
(Jong Kook's being tempted.)

1971
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:31,217
I won't eat it.

1972
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:32,807
I won't eat it.

1973
01:15:32,907 --> 01:15:34,307
(I said I won't eat it.)

1974
01:15:34,507 --> 01:15:35,607
No.

1975
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:36,677
(No, I won't eat it.)

1976
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:37,807
I won't eat it.

1977
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:39,477
I won't eat it.

1978
01:15:39,677 --> 01:15:41,107
I can't eat it.

1979
01:15:41,107 --> 01:15:42,407
(He denies the meat.)

1980
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:44,107
(His left arm is free.)

1981
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:45,107
What are you doing?

1982
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:47,007
(Was this it?)

1983
01:15:47,107 --> 01:15:48,217
What?

1984
01:15:48,307 --> 01:15:49,507
What is this?

1985
01:15:49,677 --> 01:15:50,717
What?

1986
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:53,607
You're setting me free because I refused to eat.

1987
01:15:57,907 --> 01:16:03,107
(Now it's the video.)

1988
01:16:03,217 --> 01:16:05,217
(It's so funny.)

1989
01:16:08,907 --> 01:16:11,607
(He laughs.)

1990
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:15,717
(The clowns exit.)

1991
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:18,107
(He's serious.)

1992
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,217
What?

1993
01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:25,377
(He shakes his head.)

1994
01:16:25,407 --> 01:16:26,717
I won't do as you say.

1995
01:16:26,807 --> 01:16:29,107
(I won't do as you say.)

1996
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:30,407
I won't do as you say.

1997
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:35,107
That's right.

1998
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,107
That's right.

1999
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,007
(His right hand is free.)

2000
01:16:39,007 --> 01:16:40,217
Okay, great.

2001
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:41,807
Only one leg needs to be free.

2002
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:43,217
(His leg has to be free.)

2003
01:16:44,107 --> 01:16:48,477
(They give him scissors.)

2004
01:16:48,507 --> 01:16:49,677
Do you want me to cut the rope?

2005
01:16:49,677 --> 01:16:51,217
(Do you want me to cut the rope?)

2006
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,807
(He cuts it.)

2007
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:58,217
(Snipping)

2008
01:16:59,217 --> 01:17:00,217
Is this it?

2009
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:02,107
It's done.

2010
01:17:02,377 --> 01:17:03,507
Can I go now?

2011
01:17:03,807 --> 01:17:05,107
I can go, right?

2012
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:06,807
I'm leaving.

2013
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:09,217
This was it.

2014
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:15,107
(Hee Jun passed the first two rounds.)

2015
01:17:15,217 --> 01:17:16,217
Is this a trick?

2016
01:17:16,307 --> 01:17:21,577
(He's given a pair of scissors.)

2017
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,307
The simple way would...

2018
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:28,607
be cutting the rope.

2019
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:31,407
(The simple way would be cutting the rope.)

2020
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:35,607
(Is it right?)

2021
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:40,807
(He hesitates.)

2022
01:17:44,607 --> 01:17:46,307
Can it be this simple?

2023
01:17:49,307 --> 01:17:50,807
(Snipping)

2024
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:53,907
(He isn't sure.)

2025
01:17:54,607 --> 01:17:57,307
(He cuts all.)

2026
01:17:57,477 --> 01:18:00,607
(Hee Jun is free.)

2027
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:02,507
Okay, I'm free now.

2028
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:04,807
Can I go now?

2029
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:07,307
Good job.

2030
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:09,107
Running Man is fun.

2031
01:18:09,107 --> 01:18:11,107
(Good job. Running Man is fun.)

2032
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:15,607
Hee Jun.

2033
01:18:16,607 --> 01:18:17,907
- Hee Jun. - Yes?

2034
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:19,607
- Where are you? - I escaped.

2035
01:18:19,717 --> 01:18:20,907
- Did you? - Yes.

2036
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:22,717
We have to find Gary first.

2037
01:18:22,717 --> 01:18:24,907
(Gary is here.)

2038
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:27,307
It's delicious.

2039
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:29,717
I could live on meat alone.

2040
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:30,807
(I could live on meat alone.)

2041
01:18:33,007 --> 01:18:34,307
Jong Kook is in this room.

2042
01:18:35,107 --> 01:18:36,107
- Hey. - Hey, Ji Hyo.

2043
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:38,107
The four of us are here.

2044
01:18:38,377 --> 01:18:39,717
This isn't funny anyway.

2045
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,007
- I thought I had to laugh. - Really?

2046
01:18:42,507 --> 01:18:45,407
We need to find Kwang Soo. I know where the secret door is.

2047
01:18:45,907 --> 01:18:47,007
Did you find my name tag?

2048
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:49,677
- We have two. - We have two.

2049
01:18:49,717 --> 01:18:50,807
(They already have two name tags.)

2050
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:55,107
He passed.

2051
01:18:55,217 --> 01:18:56,307
- Where's Kwang Soo? - Where is he?

2052
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:57,717
- Where is he? - I can't find him.

2053
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,307
(Snipping)

2054
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:02,107
Good job.

2055
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:04,107
(Jong Kook is free.)

2056
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:05,507
- That's right. - That's good.

2057
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,907
I should have figured it out earlier.

2058
01:19:08,307 --> 01:19:09,407
- We need to find Kwang Soo. - Right.

2059
01:19:09,507 --> 01:19:10,507
All we need is Kwang Soo.

2060
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:12,907
We have both Kwang Soo's and your name tags...

2061
01:19:13,107 --> 01:19:14,217
But we can't...

2062
01:19:14,307 --> 01:19:15,807
find Kwang Soo.

2063
01:19:15,907 --> 01:19:17,007
Where could he be?

2064
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:18,807
- Where is he? - I can't find him.

2065
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:24,407
(I won't laugh.)

2066
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:30,807
(He's about to cry.)

2067
01:19:32,507 --> 01:19:33,577
Did I really have to cry?

2068
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:35,717
(No, you didn't.)

2069
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:38,007
Am I free?

2070
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,907
(Kwang Soo is free.)

2071
01:19:42,717 --> 01:19:44,107
(They give him scissors.)

2072
01:19:44,217 --> 01:19:45,307
Do I just cut it?

2073
01:19:49,307 --> 01:19:50,507
Really?

2074
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:53,577
(Really?)

2075
01:19:53,607 --> 01:19:56,107
(Snipping)

2076
01:19:56,217 --> 01:19:57,717
(He cuts the rope.)

2077
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:00,717
(It's a talent to be a simple person.)

2078
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:01,807
I'm free.

2079
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:04,717
I'm leaving.

2080
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:09,007
(Now Gary is the only one who couldn't escape yet.)

2081
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,507
(Meanwhile, A Sung and Hee Jun went to find the name tags.)

2082
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:13,507
It's inside a zipper bag.

2083
01:20:17,107 --> 01:20:18,177
Where is it?

2084
01:20:19,507 --> 01:20:20,507
It's right here.

2085
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,807
(Hee Jun finds a name tag that will lift the witch's curse!)

2086
01:20:22,177 --> 01:20:23,807
It's a blank one!

2087
01:20:23,807 --> 01:20:26,307
(Lee Hee Jun)

2088
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:32,607
(Hee Jun is resurrected.)

2089
01:20:32,717 --> 01:20:33,717
He's back.

2090
01:20:33,717 --> 01:20:34,807
(Hee Jun is resurrected.)

2091
01:20:37,717 --> 01:20:39,407
Kwang Soo!

2092
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:42,107
- Come here. - There's the witch in the back.

2093
01:20:42,177 --> 01:20:43,507
- The witch is in the back. - The witch is there?

2094
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,717
She's in the back down there.

2095
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,077
- Where is your name tag? - I couldn't find it.

2096
01:20:48,107 --> 01:20:49,407
Si Wan.

2097
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:52,177
- The witch is right there. - We are all here.

2098
01:20:52,217 --> 01:20:53,307
I don't have a name tag.

2099
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:55,307
- Here's one. - We have to go there.

2100
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:56,507
You got one, right?

2101
01:20:57,217 --> 01:20:58,507
(Kwang Soo gets a name tag too.)

2102
01:20:58,607 --> 01:21:00,717
There you go.

2103
01:21:00,807 --> 01:21:01,807
(Now they have to go to the Witch's Door.)

2104
01:21:01,907 --> 01:21:04,007
I know the way, so I will take the lead.

2105
01:21:04,107 --> 01:21:05,177
Si Wan...

2106
01:21:05,217 --> 01:21:06,277
(Ji Hyo will navigate.)

2107
01:21:06,307 --> 01:21:08,307
knows the safe way.

2108
01:21:09,217 --> 01:21:10,607
But we have to be fast.

2109
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:14,717
- Hey! - Hey, Gary!

2110
01:21:14,977 --> 01:21:16,107
Did you find a name tag?

2111
01:21:16,177 --> 01:21:18,217
- I have to find a name tag? - Where have you been?

2112
01:21:18,217 --> 01:21:19,907
We need to resurrect you.

2113
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:21,007
- Who? - You.

2114
01:21:22,217 --> 01:21:24,607
Gosh, Gary. What's wrong with you?

2115
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:26,107
- You have to resurrect me? - Yes.

2116
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:27,177
How did you know that?

2117
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:29,407
What do you mean? I've been looking all over for you.

2118
01:21:29,717 --> 01:21:32,217
- You have? - Here. Where have you been?

2119
01:21:32,217 --> 01:21:33,407
(He puts the name tag on Gary first.)

2120
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:34,607
- You can't... - Hey.

2121
01:21:34,717 --> 01:21:37,217
get caught.

2122
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:38,807
All of us have to gather here...

2123
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:41,307
and go through that door.

2124
01:21:41,407 --> 01:21:42,717
Okay.

2125
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:43,717
Be careful.

2126
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,370
Gosh, I should've eaten some more meat.

2127
01:22:06,733 --> 01:22:07,733
(At that time)

2128
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:08,993
Hey, Gary.

2129
01:22:09,023 --> 01:22:11,756
(Look who it is!)

2130
01:22:12,023 --> 01:22:13,093
Where have you been?

2131
01:22:13,823 --> 01:22:15,233
- I've been looking for you. - Me?

2132
01:22:15,233 --> 01:22:16,623
- Yes. - Why?

2133
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:17,733
What do you mean why?

2134
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:18,923
- I have to rip your name tag. - No!

2135
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:20,023
(I have to rip your name tag.)

2136
01:22:20,993 --> 01:22:22,123
(Catch Gary!)

2137
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:23,703
Catch him!

2138
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:24,423
(Gary is helpless inside the witch's garden.)

2139
01:22:24,423 --> 01:22:25,423
No!

2140
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,523
(Gary is helpless inside the witch's garden.)

2141
01:22:26,623 --> 01:22:29,023
No! No!

2142
01:22:29,123 --> 01:22:30,323
No!

2143
01:22:30,523 --> 01:22:31,623
(It's ripped.)

2144
01:22:32,623 --> 01:22:34,820
(But I just got it.)

2145
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:36,632
(At that time)

2146
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:38,398
I will save you!

2147
01:22:38,398 --> 01:22:39,898
Don't come.

2148
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:41,708
Go that way.

2149
01:22:41,798 --> 01:22:44,098
I'm going to put the name tag on him!

2150
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,598
Run! Run, A Sung!

2151
01:22:46,598 --> 01:22:47,708
Run!

2152
01:22:47,798 --> 01:22:48,798
(A Sung gets her name tag ripped as well.)

2153
01:22:48,898 --> 01:22:49,898
Gary!

2154
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,068
(I am sorry, A Sung.)

2155
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:52,168
She ripped my name tag.

2156
01:22:52,998 --> 01:22:54,098
Did she?

2157
01:22:54,168 --> 01:22:55,208
(But she gets ready to be resurrected right away.)

2158
01:22:58,798 --> 01:23:00,998
(She puts her name on the blank name tag.)

2159
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:02,208
Please put this on me.

2160
01:23:02,298 --> 01:23:03,298
Please.

2161
01:23:03,398 --> 01:23:04,398
(She's in a hurry.)

2162
01:23:06,598 --> 01:23:07,598
(Ko A Sung)

2163
01:23:07,998 --> 01:23:11,798
(I'm sorry, Gary!)

2164
01:23:11,998 --> 01:23:15,298
(I will find another name tag and come back to save you!)

2165
01:23:15,398 --> 01:23:16,398
That was so scary.

2166
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:19,398
Run!

2167
01:23:19,498 --> 01:23:21,598
(Run!)

2168
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,208
Let's go.

2169
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:25,708
Over here! Save me!

2170
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,598
- Save me! - Where's the path?

2171
01:23:28,798 --> 01:23:29,898
Where's the path?

2172
01:23:30,398 --> 01:23:31,798
Rip this, please!

2173
01:23:31,998 --> 01:23:33,068
Rip this!

2174
01:23:33,598 --> 01:23:35,898
- We have to hurry. - We have to be careful.

2175
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:37,708
We might have to rip the others' name tags.

2176
01:23:37,798 --> 01:23:40,098
What are you doing?

2177
01:23:40,168 --> 01:23:41,708
- They are gathered. - They are complete.

2178
01:23:41,798 --> 01:23:42,968
Wait.

2179
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:44,208
- No! - Rip it!

2180
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,598
(Throw yourselves and defend the Witch's Door!)

2181
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:47,798
Rip Kwang Soo's name tag!

2182
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:49,668
(Oh my gosh!)

2183
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:52,598
(They catch Kwang Soo.)

2184
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:53,708
(Ripping)

2185
01:23:54,298 --> 01:23:56,598
Yes!

2186
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,498
Hurry! Go!

2187
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:01,398
Come on. You ripped it, right?

2188
01:24:01,498 --> 01:24:03,498
- We can do that, right? - I didn't know you could do that.

2189
01:24:03,598 --> 01:24:04,598
No.

2190
01:24:05,298 --> 01:24:08,208
(One person from each team is locked in the ice.)

2191
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:10,708
- Hurry. - Hey.

2192
01:24:10,798 --> 01:24:11,798
Ta-da!

2193
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:14,708
(It's a blank name tag!)

2194
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:21,298
(Haha found a name tag a while ago.)

2195
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:23,798
I found one.

2196
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:27,068
(He hid it just in case he'll need it later.)

2197
01:24:27,098 --> 01:24:29,668
(He never knew it was going to save them.)

2198
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,068
- I have one! - He's got one!

2199
01:24:31,098 --> 01:24:32,498
- You have a blank one? - He has one.

2200
01:24:32,598 --> 01:24:35,068
- You have a blank one? - Of course. I found one.

2201
01:24:35,098 --> 01:24:36,898
Hurry up.

2202
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:38,598
Hurry up!

2203
01:24:38,598 --> 01:24:39,898
(If they resurrect Kwang Soo, they can escape right away.)

2204
01:24:39,968 --> 01:24:42,598
- Okay! - Hurry up!

2205
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,998
- Here! - They might hear us.

2206
01:24:45,098 --> 01:24:46,708
- Come on out! - Cover his mouth.

2207
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:48,598
- They are coming. - Jae Seok!

2208
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,208
How do we go through this door?

2209
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:52,398
(No way!)

2210
01:24:52,498 --> 01:24:55,398
(Will they succeed?)

2211
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:57,968
Here we come!

2212
01:24:57,998 --> 01:24:59,798
(Here we come!)

2213
01:25:01,798 --> 01:25:03,798
(Team Ji Hyo successfully escapes.)

2214
01:25:05,098 --> 01:25:07,598
Ji Hyo and her siblings...

2215
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:10,398
returned to the warm Running Village...

2216
01:25:10,498 --> 01:25:12,798
and lived happily ever after.

2217
01:25:13,098 --> 01:25:16,798
Meanwhile, where are A Sung and her siblings?

2218
01:25:17,498 --> 01:25:19,708
Good job, everybody!

2219
01:25:19,798 --> 01:25:21,998
- See you later! - Lovely.

2220
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:23,898
Hee Jun, say something.

2221
01:25:23,998 --> 01:25:26,068
- It was really fun today. - Was it?

2222
01:25:26,098 --> 01:25:27,398
I got a name tag too.

2223
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,498
I'll congratulate you in advance for your marriage.

2224
01:25:30,598 --> 01:25:31,598
(Hee Jun is getting married this spring.)

2225
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:33,168
- Congratulations! - Congratulations.

2226
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,598
He's marrying the lady who was once here.

2227
01:25:34,598 --> 01:25:36,498
- He's marrying Hye Jeong. - Hye Jeong.

2228
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,598
After being on here three times,

2229
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:39,998
my team finally won.

2230
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,098
But most importantly,

2231
01:25:41,298 --> 01:25:43,098
I still haven't ripped someone's name tag yet.

2232
01:25:43,398 --> 01:25:44,398
You have to come again then.

2233
01:25:44,498 --> 01:25:46,798
- So I have a reason to come back. - Yes.

2234
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:50,068
I will be happy to come back and give another try.

2235
01:25:50,998 --> 01:25:53,798
And let's give our special thanks to Yun Hwa...

2236
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,708
who's been in the cold all day.

2237
01:25:56,798 --> 01:25:58,798
- You did a good job. - Good job.

2238
01:25:58,898 --> 01:26:00,998
- You did a good job. - She played three roles.

2239
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:02,598
Team Ji Hyo wins!

2240
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:07,598
(Regardless of the result, everyone had fun, and it's a happy ending!)

2241
01:26:08,098 --> 01:26:09,708
- What's that? - Something is coming down!

2242
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,208
Those are footballs.

2243
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,708
- Come here! - Come here!

2244
01:26:12,798 --> 01:26:13,998
I got it!

2245
01:26:14,098 --> 01:26:15,098
- It's an invitation. - An invitation?

2246
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:18,708
We'd like to invite you to the ground filled with heat.

2247
01:26:19,098 --> 01:26:20,898
I will see you in Shanghai.

2248
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:22,798
(Park Ji Sung)

2249
01:26:23,398 --> 01:26:24,708
(Song Joong Ki)

2250
01:26:25,098 --> 01:26:26,168
(Jung Il Woo)

2251
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:27,898
(The mission starts as soon as they wake up!)

2252
01:26:27,998 --> 01:26:29,208
No! No!

2253
01:26:29,298 --> 01:26:30,968
Is this Mission Impossible?

2254
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:34,498
(The mission begins with a football.)

2255
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:35,798
I ripped it first.

2256
01:26:36,398 --> 01:26:38,208
(And they get the chance to score a goal!)

2257
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:39,398
(Will Running Man be able to score a goal at last?)

2258
01:26:39,498 --> 01:26:40,708
It's finished!

2259
01:26:41,598 --> 01:26:44,098
(FC Running Man in Shanghai)
