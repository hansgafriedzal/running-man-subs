00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,090
(2016 Running Man Project)

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,280
(Running Man "Wish List Episode 1")

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,780
Running Man survey.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,280
- The restaurant I want to visit.
 - The special episode I want.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,490
You have to go to seven restaurants that you picked...

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,120
within 12 hours.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,380
- All of them?
 - We have to hurry.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,220
We really don't have time.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,680
- Thank you for the food.
 - It's unbelievably delicious.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,580
- It's unbelievable, isn't it?
 - We have to go.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,950
- Let's go.
 - We don't have time.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,180
- It's here!
 - It's open!

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,090
(And...)

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,880
- Let's go on a trip together
 - Together

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,350
- Let's forget everything
 - Let's forget everything

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,120
- I'm happy right now.
 - Are you?

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,480
(Gary and Ji Hyo have been together for 6 years.)

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
- Is this an engagement ring?
 - Engagement ring?

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
Do you think things would've been better if we did this earlier?

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,780
Fate brought us together.

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,520
(Could they have been better off if they did this earlier?)

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,680
(February 15, 2016 at Mokdong SBS building)

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,790
Wow.

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,980
(There's a table filled with delicious desserts.)

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,880
- Yes. What's this?
 - Hello.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,680
- What's this?
 - What are we doing today?

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,980
- What's this?
 - Oh dear.

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,120
- What's this now?
 - Wow!

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,580
- It's our breakfast!
 - Something amazing will happen.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,380
Whenever they feed us something nice, they make us work hard.

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,220
- I know. This is a sign.
 - They make us work even harder.

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,480
- I have a bad feeling.
 - Don't eat it.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,580
- Since it's here, I'll eat it.
 - Is this what we always...

34
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,920
Since it's here, we should eat it.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,570
We might as well eat it since they're going to make us work.

36
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,680
Recently, we did a survey.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,780
- Yes.
 - Yes.

38
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,480
Running Man survey.

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,770
Special episode that I want to do?

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,680
- I want to go to the States and...
 - Which special do you want to do?

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
We did a survey.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
And they asked us to be honest.

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,220
So this was one of the questions.

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,380
"What do you think is your strengths and weaknesses?"

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,780
- I'll read Seok Jin's answer.
 - Why?

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,840
Your answer was the longest for your strengths.

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,680
"I am humble, considerate and loyal."

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,180
"I'm good to my family and I'm not greedy." You are a liar.

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,320
- Seriously.
 - I was being honest.

50
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,680
This is your weakness.

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,690
- You're good to your family?
 - I was just being honest.

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,980
I am so good to my family though.

53
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,880
Why did your eyes turn red?

54
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
- What's wrong with that?
 - Gosh.

55
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,780
Isn't his strength that he lies often?

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,920
(What's the weakness of this perfect man?)

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,580
His weakness is that he loves to lie down and he's dull.

58
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,320
Sometimes I worry when he lies down for a long period of time.

59
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,980
- He's sleeping and...
 - We check if he's still alive.

60
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,050
(They love Seok Jin.)

61
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,580
Seok Jin! Seok Jin!

62
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,780
He really surprises us.

63
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,320
It's too much.

64
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,980
Next is Jong Kook.

65
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,690
His strength is that he has a good personality.

66
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,980
- Hey!
 - Come on.

67
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,220
- Why did you...
 - That's the best part about me.

68
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,580
- I'll fix it. He has a temper.
 - He has a temper.

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,320
- He has a temper.
 - He sure does.

70
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,580
Gary's strength is that...

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,180
he listens to other people well.

72
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,220
- He is gullible.
 - He is.

73
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,220
- This is...
 - I wrote that as my weakness.

74
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,580
- I said I am too gullible.
 - What did you write?

75
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,050
- It's here. "I'm too gullible."
 - Really?

76
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,780
Why didn't you write "I'm too ugly"?

77
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,380
That's the last bit of my pride.

78
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,050
Don't mess with my pride.

79
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,220
Why didn't you write "I'm a fish"?

80
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,680
Ji Hyo's strength is that she forgets things fast.

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,160
- Really?
 - You forget too many things.

82
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
Isn't this your weakness?

83
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
You hurt other people, and you forget it fast.

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,680
- I know.
 - That's my problem.

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,120
What's her weakness? She wrote it well. "Quick temper."

86
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,220
(Her weakness is having a quick temper.)

87
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,120
- I wrote it.
 - She knew about it!

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,980
- I always admitted it.
 - I got goose bumps.

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,850
- I...
 - She's so honest.

90
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,220
- She has a quick temper.
 - But...

91
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,120
I can't help myself having a quick temper.

92
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
- I know. Ji Hyo wrote...
 - You have a quick temper.

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,850
"I have a quick temper, and I feel sorry."

94
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,680
But it takes a little bit of time for her to feel sorry.

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,980
- It takes some time.
 - We don't know if it will take...

96
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,080
- That's not it.
 - a year or two.

97
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
We don't know about that.

98
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,680
She apologised today for what she did on episode five.

99
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,950
- Is that right?
 - Yes. It took five years.

100
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,220
Ji Hyo feels sorry and apologises eventually.

101
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,680
She has a soft heart.

102
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,380
To the question "Which game are you confident to win?",

103
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,680
Seok Jin said, "Game of slap-match, not getting upset and not smiling."

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,580
- I think the last two are wrong.
 - Why?

105
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
I can refrain from getting upset in any situation.

106
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,680
I don't get upset easily.

107
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
- You...
 - I don't get upset easily.

108
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,010
- Let's see.
 - His face is red.

109
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,320
- Let's see.
 - Darn it!

110
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,580
(He's surprised.)

111
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,580
He gets upset!

112
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,780
- Hey! That was uncalled for.
 - I am sorry.

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,580
He doesn't get upset easily.

114
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

115
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,580
- I'm sorry.
 - What was that for?

116
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,580
- Erase this.
 - That was too much.

117
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,880
You lost to me when we played the game of slap-match.

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,220
No way.

119
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,320
- You're upset.
 - He's upset again.

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,380
- You're upset.
 - No, I'm not.

121
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,220
- I'm not upset.
 - Yes, you are.

122
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
- You're upset.
 - He's very upset.

123
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,380
- His face turned red.
 - He's very upset.

124
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,880
- It's a normal reaction.
 - He's very upset.

125
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,320
"Which food do you eat when you feel weak?" You can't eat that now.

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,620
- Why not?
 - You can't eat right now.

127
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,450
Are you upset?

128
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,320
(Is he upset?)

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
(Oh! I forgot.)

130
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,990
- He has a quick temper.
 - He does.

131
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,990
- He gets upset so easily.
 - He gets upset easily.

132
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,450
He gets upset really quickly.

133
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,480
- Go to the hospital.
 - His ears are turning red as well.

134
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,320
You get upset really easily.

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,580
You need to get an anger management therapy.

136
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,220
Your face turned red.

137
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,080
- Your face turned red.
 - This part turned really red.

138
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,490
To the question "Which restaurant do you want to take the members?",

139
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,490
Seok Jin wrote, "Ganghwado mud eel".

140
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,380
Ganghwado mud eel is amazing.

141
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,680
It sounds delicious.

142
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
- It's delicious.
 - Gary wrote a good one.

143
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,580
Apgujeong's cold buckwheat noodles and pork cutlet.

144
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,120
And Kwangju Restaurant's spicy octopus stir-fry.

145
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,490
- Where is that?
 - It's in Daechi-dong.

146
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,120
Haha wrote "Jeju's pork kimchi stew".

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,580
Remember that place?

148
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,780
We went there together. We got the business card.

149
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,080
Ji Hyo wrote "Half-dried herring". You mean your cousin's, right?

150
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,580
- He sends it to you.
 - I'm...

151
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,880
- from Pohang.
 - Yes.

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,580
- And its specialty is...
 - Her cousin sends it to us...

153
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,580
- when it's in season.
 - Yes.

154
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,220
- The season is...
 - It's over.

155
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,680
- He sent it once.
 - It's over now.

156
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,580
- He sent it twice.
 - Why did I only get it once?

157
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,950
(He's upset.)

158
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,580
- Stop getting upset!
 - He's upset again.

159
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,050
- This is too much.
 - You're burning inside.

160
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,220
- No. No.
 - Your face is red.

161
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,220
- Seriously.
 - He gets upset so easily.

162
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,850
No, he doesn't.

163
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,580
From now on, we will reflect your wishes...

164
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,120
when coming up with missions.

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,480
- I see.
 - And that starts today.

166
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,380
I will announce today's race.

167
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,120
2016 Running Man Wish List episode one.

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,220
It's called "Seven Spoons".

169
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,580
- "Seven Spoons"?
 - "Seven Spoons".

170
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,480
There were many restaurants you recommended in the survey.

171
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,450
We narrowed them down to seven restaurants.

172
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,680
You have to visit all 7 restaurants in 12 hours.

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,280
- All of them?
 - All of them?

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,580
If you succeed within 12 hours,

175
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,320
you will get a gold spoon.

176
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
If you fail, you will get punished.

177
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
After you finish eating at each restaurant,

178
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,480
you will be given the chance to increase your chance of success.

179
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,580
There are different chances available.

180
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,120
You don't know which chance you will get until you pick it.

181
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,680
There are people who recommended two restaurants.

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,980
So you have to pick one and go there.

183
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,320
- We should pick a near one.
 - Okay.

184
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,480
- How about Jejudo Island?
 - We have to go to Jejudo Island.

185
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Will Gary pick one first?

186
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
That's up to you guys to decide.

187
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
- Gary...
 - Please pick one for me.

188
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,580
- Which restaurant did you write?
 - Haha, please pick one.

189
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,580
But they are both close. It's either Apgujeong or Daechi-dong.

190
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,380
- Hurry up.
 - I hope you pick buckwheat noodles.

191
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,920
Pick it!

192
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,580
- Apgujeong!
 - Apgujeong!

193
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,950
- Great.
 - Apgujeong!

194
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,580
- This is good.
 - We did it.

195
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,880
It's pork cutlet and buckwheat noodles.

196
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
- You picked it well.
 - I'm in trouble.

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,880
We have to eat a lot, so pick something less stuffing.

198
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
- Where are the restaurants?
 - Ganghwado Island and Sinsa-dong.

199
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,580
- Ganghwado Island is too far.
 - Let's pick Sinsa-dong.

200
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,780
It'll be too far.

201
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,180
Should I pick the one on the right or on the left?

202
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,900
Which one do you want to pick?

203
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,320
- Sinsa-dong would be nice.
 - I will pick this one.

204
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,850
- The one on the right?
 - Yes.

205
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,180
Then we should pick the one on the left.

206
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,080
Okay.

207
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
(Here we go!)

208
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,220
(Will they go to Ganghwado Island?)

209
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,420
(Or will they go to Sinsa-dong?)

210
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,980
It's Ganghwado Island.

211
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
(He's unlucky all the time.)

212
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,050
Hey! I said I wanted to pick the other one.

213
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,760
You should've picked the opposite one of the one you wanted to pick.

214
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,320
- You are...
 - You are really unlucky.

215
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,380
Ji Hyo's pick is crucial.

216
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,840
It's...

217
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,980
either Pohang or Muan.

218
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,780
- What?
 - Mud octopus is in Muan.

219
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,050
Pick one.

220
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,580
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

221
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,120
- Which one should I pick?
 - Pick one.

222
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,780
They are both bad.

223
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
- We don't have any expectations.
 - They are both too far.

224
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
(They are both too far.)

225
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,220
- Hurry up.
 - We have a time limit.

226
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,580
- They are both the same.
 - It's Pohang.

227
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,780
It's Muan.

228
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,470
(They sigh.)

229
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,050
- It's frustrating.
 - It is really frustrating.

230
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,420
All right. What's next?

231
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,480
You just made it very awkward.

232
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,120
(They are done choosing the seven restaurants.)

233
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,580
- If you fail the mission...
 - And?

234
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,480
If you fail to visit the seven restaurants,

235
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,220
one of you has to get punished.

236
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,480
Oh.

237
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,880
If you fail to visit five restaurants, one of...

238
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,120
the five people will get punished.

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,220
- In the ending spot,
 - The more, the better.

240
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,090
you will spin the roulette.

241
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,180
- Oh dear.
 - You will vote for...

242
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,900
the punishment to give to each other as a gift.

243
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,420
Let's do something fun.

244
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,620
What should I pick?

245
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,080
(Gary cracks up.)

246
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,840
I don't know what to write.

247
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,420
(Shave his head?)

248
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,950
That's crazy.

249
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,780
(Jae Seok asks Haha to shave his head as punishment.)

250
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,480
Just the thought of it cracks me up.

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,220
He fixed his hair so nicely.

252
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
(You're going to make me shave my head?)

253
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,320
He fixed his hair so nicely.

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,220
All right.

255
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,880
Just two words.

256
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,920
Just like an octopus head.

257
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,470
An octopus doesn't have hair on its head.

258
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,320
I should write this for Haha.

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,250
Go to a competing barbecue restaurant and do an event.

260
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,220
(That event will bring all the restaurant owners together!)

261
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,880
That's too much.

262
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,980
That's a good one.

263
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,050
We did it already.

264
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,880
I will give Gary something really easy.

265
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,050
(What will Gary's punishment be?)

266
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,590
- He will do an event wearing that?
 - A squid mask?

267
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,470
- Oh my gosh!
 - I just wrote...

268
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,780
I wrote "Wear a squid mask and go to an event."

269
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,680
- "Go up on the stage with it."
 - And nobody will see a difference.

270
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,450
They will just say, "Go, Gary!"

271
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,120
- "Gary, you are handsome!"
 - Nobody will notice the mask.

272
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,890
"Gary is so handsome."

273
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,320
"He looks much more handsome in real life."

274
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,100
They will just think it's me. They won't think I'm wearing a mask.

275
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,850
- Jae Seok's done everything.
 - He doesn't have anything...

276
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,480
- Pick something he hates.
 - that he dislikes.

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,590
I wrote this. "Wear contact lenses and shoot an episode."

278
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,680
(Wear contact lenses for a shoot)

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,950
(The viewers have to put up with Jae Seok's face.)

280
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,120
- That's a good one.
 - That's really brutal.

281
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Isn't one episode too much? It'll disturb the viewers.

282
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,220
That's too much.

283
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm going to make Ji Hyo collect insects.

284
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,480
- That sounds great.
 - Why did you hit me?

285
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,580
- That'd be fun.
 - Why?

286
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,150
That'd be great.

287
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
That'd be nice.

288
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,980
Mantes, caterpillars and everything.

289
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,670
I wrote something for Ji Hyo.

290
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,180
She should shoot "We Got Married" with Gary.

291
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,480
I'd love to see that.

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
Ji Hyo and Gary shooting "We Got Married".

293
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,680
Right?

294
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,350
Why are you doing it only with Chen Bolin?

295
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,380
Exactly.

296
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,870
Find us a tiny apartment.

297
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,280
(Let me be right next to you.)

298
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
So that we can be right next to each other.

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,880
A tiny apartment?

300
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,090
(Will Gary's wish come true?)

301
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,480
Then, please decide in which order you will visit the restaurants.

302
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,950
- At each restaurant,
 - Wait...

303
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,180
you have to follow an option.

304
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,080
- What's that?
 - They're your destinations.

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Ganghwado Mud Eel.

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,780
Chicken kalguksu!

307
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,480
- The one near Kwang Soo's place?
 - Yes, you're right.

308
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,980
- They only do deliveries.
 - Around Kwang Soo's apartment.

309
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,970
We should eat at his place.

310
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,580
They only do deliveries.

311
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,880
(They want to intrude Kwang Soo's apartment.)

312
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,180
- Wait.
 - You didn't tell me about this.

313
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,080
- Why at my apartment?
 - The thing is...

314
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,750
I didn't know the name of the restaurant.

315
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,950
So I wrote your name instead.

316
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,680
And I have no say in this?

317
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,250
They only do deliveries.

318
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,080
- This is Kwang Soo's apartment.
 - It looks better now.

319
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Someone's in the bed. I mean it.

320
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Stop the nonsense.

321
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,780
What are you installing?

322
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,080
Let me use the bathroom.

323
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,380
Why is everyone using my bathroom?

324
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,480
Isn't it nice to have some people in your apartment?

325
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,780
Right?

326
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,180
(We'll show you the limit of Kwang Soo's patience.)

327
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,680
Are these our chances?

328
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
No, they are...

329
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,580
the options you have.

330
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,980
- What is this?
 - "It Has To Be Me"?

331
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,480
- "Times 2".
 - Do you get 2 portions?

332
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,280
- Will they give you big portions?
 - What do they mean?

333
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,580
Guys.

334
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,780
We'll start the timer now. Start.

335
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,280
- We should hurry.
 - Wait.

336
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,880
We should use this. Where should we start?

337
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes.

338
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,250
Should we start in Samseong-dong?

339
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,580
Let's start from the farthest one.

340
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,080
- Samseong-dong.
 - Samseong-dong.

341
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,980
- And then Apgujeong.
 - Apgujeong.

342
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,680
- And then Geumho-dong.
 - Geumho-dong.

343
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,380
- Are we going to my apartment?
 - Of course.

344
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,780
- Really?
 - All right.

345
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,750
- Ganghwado.
 - And then...

346
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,580
- And we split?
 - Yes, we will.

347
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,880
Let's go. We don't have much time.

348
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,680
- Let's go.
 - Time is ticking.

349
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,580
- Let's start now.
 - All right.

350
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,680
Give me my jacket.

351
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,580
- Let's go.
 - It's not a lot of time.

352
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,280
We'll visit a lot of restaurants today.

353
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,180
(Spicy beef noodles soup, pork cutlet, chicken kalguksu,)

354
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,180
(kimchi stew, barbecue, eel, octopus)

355
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,750
Let's get going.

356
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,480
Wait. Was this place recommended by Gary?

357
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,780
- No, it was me.
 - Oh, was it you?

358
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,480
This place is amazing.

359
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,080
- I've been there once.
 - Especially in this weather.

360
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,780
Their spicy beef soup comes with noodles in it.

361
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,980
I love spicy beef soup with noodles.

362
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,780
- It'd be perfect for the weather.
 - It'd be perfect.

363
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,750
I don't want to shave my head.

364
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,380
I love my hairstyle now.

365
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,680
If we clear our mission, no one will have to be punished.

366
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,180
Seok Jin, you have longer hair than your wife.

367
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,880
(Spicy beef noodles soup in Samseong-dong)

368
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,350
(Recommended by Kwang Soo, in Samseong-dong, Seoul)

369
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,680
- It's here.
 - Oh, it's here.

370
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,870
It's here. Let's get off.

371
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,080
- Let's go!
 - We don't have a lot of time.

372
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm looking forward.

373
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,780
I think it'll be amazing.

374
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
An hour and a half has passed.

375
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
An hour and a half has passed already.

376
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,850
- It's here.
 - Come here.

377
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,080
(There's no time to hesitate.)

378
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,680
Oh, it's here.

379
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,180
- It looks nice.
 - It looks great.

380
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,880
Wow, I'm so excited.

381
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,580
It smells so nice.

382
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,250
- Oh, my goodness.
 - It smells so good.

383
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,980
It smells fantastic.

384
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,880
- Who recommended this place?
 - I did.

385
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,780
- Was it Kwang Soo?
 - This looks amazing.

386
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,080
It looks delicious.

387
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
They serve only one dish...

388
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,850
- just as good restaurants should.
 - This must be it.

389
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,380
You get noodles and rice.

390
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,580
Let's start eating.

391
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,350
We have 10 hours and 37 minutes.

392
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,480
- We should hurry.
 - An hour and a half has passed.

393
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
- The food is here.
 - It's here.

394
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,350
Hello.

395
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,180
- This is it.
 - This is it.

396
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,680
- That looks good.
 - I'm so looking forward to it.

397
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,980
- Stop. Put down your chopsticks.
 - What? Why?

398
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,280
(Stop)

399
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,480
- Why?
 - Why?

400
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,080
We have an option to follow.

401
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,780
Oh, right.

402
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,280
- We should eat it before it cools.
 - For spicy beef noodles soup,

403
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,750
- you chose an option,
 - Yes.

404
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,680
- "It Has To Be Me".
 - "It Has To Be Me".

405
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,480
You chose "It Has To Be Me".

406
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,580
Only six of you can eat here.

407
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,880
The one the owner chooses...

408
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,770
won't get to eat.

409
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,120
That's impossible.

410
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,580
I'm starving.

411
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,680
We have to eat.

412
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,080
This soup is amazing.

413
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
It's perfect for our first meal.

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,080
- It's our first meal.
 - But...

415
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,880
the one who gets chosen shouldn't eat.

416
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
- We have to follow the rule.
 - We can't help it.

417
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,680
- Let's do it for real.
 - Are you going to choose?

418
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
- I recommended this place.
 - Please.

419
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,850
- It was me.
 - Please.

420
00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:02,260
(Please don't choose me.)

421
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,580
(Who will be the unlucky one?)

422
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
I hope it's Kwang Soo.

423
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,980
- It's Seok Jin.
 - It's Seok Jin.

424
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,050
This is impossible.

425
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,480
It's Seok Jin.

426
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,180
This is impossible.

427
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,250
(Does it have to be me?)

428
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,970
You're cruel.

429
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,480
- Gosh.
 - Thank you.

430
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,580
(Seok Jin's soup is taken away.)

431
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,880
This is absurd.

432
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,780
It wasn't even a prank.

433
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,680
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

434
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,580
(Seok Jin has been unlucky for the whole six years.)

435
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,180
- Try it.
 - Let's try.

436
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,480
- It's perfect for the first meal.
 - This is amazing.

437
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Gosh.

438
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,880
I love spicy beef noodles soup.

439
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,780
I didn't know this place.

440
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,580
They have other stores in Samseong-dong...

441
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
- and in Samgakji.
 - I didn't know I would be chosen.

442
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,880
This tastes amazing.

443
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,280
This tastes really good.

444
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,750
- The soup is so flavourful.
 - You can take it away as well.

445
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,480
It's perfect for the weather.

446
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,860
(I'm going crazy.)

447
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,250
(Seok Jin feels left out.)

448
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,160
You guys don't even look at me.

449
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,050
- Are you angry?
 - No, I'm not.

450
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,080
- You never get angry.
 - Hey.

451
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,680
(They're almost sticking their faces in their bowls.)

452
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,880
This tastes great.

453
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
- Kwang Soo chose the right place.
 - I agree.

454
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,380
(They love Kwang Soo's recommendation.)

455
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,480
- It's spicy.
 - You usually wait in a line.

456
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,880
Just this.

457
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,380
- I should be allowed this much.
 - No, you're not.

458
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,580
Let me taste it.

459
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,750
(Seok Jin is desperate to taste it.)

460
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,880
This is amazing.

461
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,380
How could I be chosen?

462
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,880
It should have been Kwang Soo.

463
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
My goodness.

464
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,080
Eat a lot in the next place.

465
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,960
- What will we eat next?
 - This tastes amazing.

466
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,380
This tastes really good.

467
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,880
If you don't eat this... Wait.

468
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,980
These noodles are raw.

469
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,250
I'll dip it in the soup.

470
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,380
(Seok Jin's chopsticks are taken away.)

471
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,880
- It was amazing.
 - How can you be so cruel?

472
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,350
Please give us some rice.

473
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,170
They must have boiled the soup for a very long time.

474
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,780
The beef is very soft.

475
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,380
Let me just take a look.

476
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,280
- Let me see this.
 - They're just green onions.

477
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,380
Just a piece of green onion.

478
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,080
(Jae Seok doesn't let Seok Jin taste the food.)

479
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,790
Why are you so desperate?

480
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,880
Desperate?

481
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,680
Are you angry?

482
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,180
(Did you say I look desperate?)

483
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,170
- Are you angry?
 - No, I'm not.

484
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,980
I'm not angry. I'm just talking.

485
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,590
- Are you sure?
 - Of course.

486
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,550
This is perfect for the weather. I can't think of anything else.

487
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,050
- Nothing is better for today.
 - You're right.

488
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,880
- I love spicy soup.
 - Me too.

489
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,150
It'll be perfect for hangover.

490
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,880
You're right.

491
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,750
I would drink just so that I can eat this soup.

492
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,080
Exactly.

493
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
- I'm happy you like it.
 - This calls for alcohol.

494
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,580
Should we share what we thought of the soup?

495
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,460
Let's start from Haha.

496
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,650
This is a dish for world peace.

497
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,180
There will be no war as long as we have this soup.

498
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,580
- Good job!
 - Good job!

499
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,680
We should worship this soup.

500
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,680
The greatest spicy beef noodle soup.

501
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,860
I worship you, spicy beef noodle soup.

502
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,180
- I worship you.
 - I worship you.

503
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,850
- You should call it "Hundred Soup".
 - Why?

504
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,380
It deserves 100 points out of 100.

505
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,960
This should be called "Hundred Soup".

506
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,790
- Spicy beef noodles soup.
 - And what?

507
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,980
(Spicy beef noodles soup...)

508
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,780
You have to live with me from today.

509
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,550
- What?
 - Be mine.

510
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,480
Like the song.

511
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,850
Be mine

512
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,680
- Be mine
 - Be mine

513
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,790
I love only you

514
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,280
- I do
 - I do

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,380
This shouldn't be called just "soup".

516
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,980
- This is "The Greatest Soup".
 - "The Greatest Soup".

517
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,680
Go away, frozen shoulder!

518
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,090
Really?

519
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,850
I can raise my arms after having this soup.

520
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,350
(Full of energy)

521
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,050
I can straighten my back now.

522
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,350
Wait.

523
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,970
I'd like to dip your hair in the soup.

524
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,650
This looks like spaghetti.

525
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,680
I could even eat his hair if it's dipped in this soup.

526
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,580
While you're enjoying yourselves...

527
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,880
- Oh, we have a limited time.
 - We forgot about the time.

528
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
- Let's go.
 - Let's hurry.

529
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
- Let's go to the next place.
 - We have no time for this.

530
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,880
- Let's go.
 - Aren't we using the chance?

531
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,790
- Let's use it later.
 - What was the next one?

532
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,180
- We'll use it later.
 - The buckwheat noodles.

533
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,350
- Let's go now!
 - Let's go!

534
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,790
This was amazing.

535
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,580
- It really was.
 - I feel so proud.

536
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,790
Thank you for the food.

537
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,680
- Thank you.
 - See you again.

538
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,380
- Thank you.
 - See you.

539
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,480
- Ji Hyo.
 - I feel so proud.

540
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,580
- It was amazing.
 - It's not cold.

541
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,350
It's not cold after having the soup.

542
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,790
We sweated.

543
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,380
It's just that the temperature has risen.

544
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
(Jae Seok is excited.)

545
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,380
Should I take my shirt off?

546
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,180
It's not cold after having the soup.

547
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,080
It's just that the temperature has gone up.

548
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,290
- No, it's the soup.
 - Your ears are red.

549
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,580
- Gary.
 - Are you sure it's not cold?

550
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,880
- It's the soup.
 - You guys are funny.

551
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,580
I feel so proud.

552
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,980
My goodness.

553
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,380
- Gary, that was great.
 - Was it that good?

554
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,790
- Was it that good?
 - It was fantastic.

555
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,380
And it was perfect for the first meal.

556
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,580
- I know what you mean.
 - What is our next meal going to be?

557
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,580
It made me feel so happy.

558
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,250
- Right. It really did.
 - Right, Ji Hyo?

559
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,680
It made me feel so happy.

560
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,880
Are you teasing me?

561
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,450
No. Are you angry again?

562
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,290
- No, I'm not.
 - You...

563
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,680
apparently have an anger management issue.

564
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,250
(Seok Jin is diagnosed with an anger management disorder.)

565
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,250
I like how we planned this. After having the spicy soup,

566
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,570
- we'll eat buckwheat noodles.
 - I'm going to eat them.

567
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,530
I love buckwheat noodles.

568
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,640
I'm already so full.

569
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,050
My stomach is half full.

570
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,680
(It's time to taste the food recommended by Gary.)

571
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,090
(Apgujeong)

572
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,680
(Buckwheat noodles and pork cutlet, Apgujeong-dong)

573
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,180
Okay. Let's eat!

574
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,880
Let's go. It's right here.

575
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,680
- We're going to the good places.
 - Let's get off.

576
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
(They're extremely excited.)

577
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,680
- It's buckwheat noodles.
 - Wow.

578
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,980
It's right here.

579
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
I love today's special episode.

580
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,790
This is it.

581
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,380
This is where we do "Times Two".

582
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,020
- Hello.
 - Hi.

583
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,580
- Let's sit.
 - It smells great in here.

584
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,980
- Goodness.
 - This is the place.

585
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,320
Shall I order?

586
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,290
- You got here quick.
 - Let's hurry up.

587
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,680
This is where we have to do "Times Two".

588
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,180
What is "Times Two"?

589
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,120
This place was recommended by Gary.

590
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,680
- That's right.
 - He did.

591
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,320
He's confident after that spicy beef noodles soup?

592
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,120
- Isn't this place famous?
 - Yes, it is.

593
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,450
- What is it?
 - I will put...

594
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,790
(I will put this pork cutlet in the centre.)

595
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,790
- Okay.
 - What is it?

596
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,590
- There are seven pieces.
 - Okay.

597
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,980
There are seven numbers underneath each piece.

598
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,120
One of you have to pick up a piece.

599
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,290
Whatever number shows up,

600
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,380
you have to double the number and order that many portions.

601
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,320
If 2 comes up, we have to order 4 pork cutlets.

602
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,220
- We have to eat four.
 - We'd have to share.

603
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,880
- Up to 3 will be good.
 - Let's pick under 3.

604
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,380
- Seok Jin will choose.
 - I'll pick.

605
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,790
- He didn't get to eat before.
 - He's unlucky though.

606
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,320
- What would be the worst?
 - It'd be seven.

607
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,880
- It's seven.
 - That's the worst.

608
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,680
- I think three is good.
 - We'll have to eat.

609
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,790
Three would be good.

610
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,020
That's true.

611
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,320
(He picks one.)

612
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,680
(What number...)

613
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,980
(will it be?)

614
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,380
- What is it?
 - It's four.

615
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,980
- That'll be 8.
 - That's 8 orders.

616
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,480
- Seok Jin can have more.
 - That's right.

617
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,880
- It's not bad.
 - We can eat eight.

618
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,980
- That's fine.
 - You can have two.

619
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,580
- You didn't eat before.
 - That was a good pick.

620
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,780
We don't have time.

621
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,380
- We have to go.
 - Let's get five noodles.

622
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,480
- Order 5 buckwheat noodles.
 - And 3 pork cutlets.

623
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
Give us 5 buck-noodles and 3 porks.

624
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,380
- Order 5 buck-noodles and 3 porks.
 - Come on.

625
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,220
Nobody says it like that these days.

626
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,280
- Who does that?
 - What's wrong with that?

627
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,780
That's not cool.

628
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,120
(That's embarrassing.)

629
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,980
Do you know how to say 2 jjolmyeons and 2 ramyeons?

630
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,420
- Of course.
 - It's "Jjoljjol, rara".

631
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
(That's old school.)

632
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,980
- What?
 - That's so old.

633
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,280
- "Jjoljjol, rara".
 - Oh goodness.

634
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,580
Tteokbokki 1, jjolmyeon 2 and ramyeon 2 is...

635
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,680
"Tteok, jjoljjol, rara".

636
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,580
(That's embarrassing.)

637
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,070
The food is here.

638
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,020
- Oh gosh.
 - That looks good.

639
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,980
(The pork cutlet is here.)

640
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,750
- Thank you.
 - That must be delicious.

641
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,880
- You two can share.
 - Okay.

642
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,380
We ordered three pork cutlets.

643
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,880
We ordered five buckwheat noodles.

644
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,520
(It's delicious.)

645
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
- How is it?
 - It's good.

646
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
(It's yummy.)

647
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,380
(The buckwheat noodles are ready.)

648
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,180
Could you give us more soup?

649
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,480
It's over there.

650
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,660
- This is great.
 - It's nice.

651
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,320
Do you want it warm?

652
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,120
(It looks amazing.)

653
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,780
- Doesn't it look delicious?
 - My gosh.

654
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Thank you, Gary.

655
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,260
- Thanks.
 - Thank you.

656
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,180
- Let's eat.
 - Enjoy.

657
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,880
(The noodles look yummy.)

658
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
This is fantastic.

659
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,280
- Wow.
 - It's so delicious.

660
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,320
(She slurps it down.)

661
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,580
It's been so long since I had this, but it still tastes the same.

662
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,980
(Cold buckwheat noodle is perfect to have in winter.)

663
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,520
This is really delicious.

664
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,580
I could eat this even when I'm full.

665
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,780
It's so delicious.

666
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,750
(He sucks in the noodles.)

667
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,680
The noodles and pork cutlet go together so well.

668
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
- Seriously.
 - Don't they?

669
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,320
The vegetables are really delicious too.

670
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,420
You have 9 hours and 38 minutes left.

671
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,580
Are we using the chance now?

672
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,780
The chance you pick now...

673
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,580
will be used on the next round.

674
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,910
- Let's do it in Geumho-dong.
 - Okay.

675
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,750
Please use the chance.

676
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,280
- What?
 - First, I need to...

677
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,880
use the bathroom when we go to your house.

678
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,980
Come on.

679
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,220
(What is he talking about?)

680
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,280
Let's use the chance.

681
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
- Let us all use your bathroom.
 - The bathroom here is better.

682
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,780
This is actually good because...

683
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,020
I need to stop by your place.

684
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,320
I have to empty my stomach and start eating again.

685
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,420
I don't like people using my bathroom.

686
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,320
- I want to use it by myself.
 - You and I go together well.

687
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,480
- We're perfect.
 - Why? Why?

688
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,620
I like doing it at other people's houses.

689
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,380
He likes to do that.

690
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,480
(Kwang Soo is dumbfounded.)

691
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
That's how I am.

692
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,900
- It's yummy.
 - Nice.

693
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,580
- We have to make a comment.
 - Yes, we do.

694
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,750
Gary should start.

695
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,480
Buckwheat noodle is like love.

696
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,680
Really?

697
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Because it knows how to play a game.

698
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,120
(Buckwheat noodle is like love.)

699
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
- That's right.
 - Okay.

700
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,100
- It's Kwang Soo's turn.
 - Okay.

701
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,030
(He feels pressured.)

702
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,580
(He looks at others.)

703
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,480
- Kwang Soo.
 - Can you think of anything?

704
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,560
(I want to know what you think.)

705
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,180
Get ready to get slapped.

706
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,120
Buckwheat noodle is...

707
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,780
(Buckwheat noodle is...)

708
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,220
(Haha slaps Kwang Soo.)

709
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,780
- What was that?
 - Didn't you finish?

710
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,480
- He's not done.
 - I think my tooth...

711
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,780
just came out.

712
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,120
- I am sorry.
 - Was it my tooth or rice?

713
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
You should've slapped him after he finished.

714
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,980
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

715
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,880
- Okay.
 - Buckwheat noodle is...

716
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,380
- like a tattoo.
 - Why?

717
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,280
(Buckwheat noodle is like a tattoo.)

718
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,620
- Why?
 - I don't know.

719
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,750
(I don't know.)

720
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,660
(Did you just blurt that out to avoid getting slapped?)

721
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,670
- I don't want to explain why.
 - Okay.

722
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,980
- Haha is up next.
 - I said...

723
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,280
spicy beef noodles soup was world peace.

724
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,020
Buckwheat noodle is...

725
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,680
- war.
 - Why?

726
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,750
(Kwang Soo throws water.)

727
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,120
(He takes revenge.)

728
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,680
What do you mean, war...

729
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,020
on a nice day like this?

730
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,380
Don't you think that was too much?

731
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,980
Hey. Don't overdo it.

732
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,580
(It's Seok Jin's turn.)

733
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,880
First of all,

734
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,080
it's teasing me.

735
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,320
- That's not how you do it.
 - That's wrong.

736
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,680
It has to be one line.

737
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,780
- You have to make it quick.
 - It has to be one line.

738
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,980
The noodle is teasing me.

739
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,750
- I don't think that works.
 - Why not?

740
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,780
- Try again.
 - How about memory of first love?

741
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,580
Well, that's a bit...

742
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,680
That's too vague.

743
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,380
Are you saying no to everything?

744
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,380
- You are, aren't you?
 - Are you mad?

745
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,180
No, I'm not!

746
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,680
(I'm not mad.)

747
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,270
I am not mad!

748
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,680
(It's his fourth try.)

749
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
Buckwheat noodle is like...

750
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,150
- Jae Seok's glasses.
 - Why?

751
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,980
Because it covers embarrassing points.

752
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,120
I'm not embarrassed.

753
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,220
(I'm not embarrassed.)

754
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,620
(I'm good looking and I'm proud.)

755
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,180
What are you talking about?

756
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,480
I'm getting angry.

757
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,980
(He starts to get angry.)

758
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,280
- He's angry.
 - No.

759
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,250
When Seok Jin gets mad his lips go like this.

760
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,480
No, I'm not mad.

761
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,120
- We don't have time.
 - You should try.

762
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,680
- Me?
 - Yes.

763
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,780
- Buckwheat noodle...
 - Everyone get ready.

764
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,280
Everyone get ready.

765
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,780
(I told you buckwheat noodle was war.)

766
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,880
(Water)

767
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
(Pickled radish)

768
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
Isn't this too much?

769
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,220
I'll make it work.

770
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,580
- Okay.
 - Come on.

771
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,980
- Get ready.
 - Wait.

772
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,480
- If...
 - Yes?

773
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,780
- Let me say something.
 - Okay.

774
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,580
If someone attacks me, even when I succeed,

775
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,280
- I'll attack back.
 - Fine.

776
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,220
(Let's see how Jae Seok does.)

777
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,780
- Get ready.
 - You should move over.

778
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,320
- Wait.
 - What's this?

779
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,120
- Gosh.
 - Could you do it...

780
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,180
- in this situation?
 - You have to...

781
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,380
- overcome it.
 - Can you?

782
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,980
- You have to.
 - I can do it.

783
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,680
- Yes, you can.
 - I can.

784
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,880
Buckwheat noodle...

785
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,680
You're so pretty, so pretty

786
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,180
(You're so pretty, so pretty.)

787
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,980
(Slapping)

788
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,980
(Kwang Soo and Haha throw water at Seok Jin.)

789
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,120
Hey!

790
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,480
- I'm sorry.
 - Hey!

791
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,580
How dare you?

792
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,580
- I aimed wrong.
 - Really?

793
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,320
- I'm sorry.
 - I am sorry.

794
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,980
- Did you do it on purpose?
 - No.

795
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,560
You idiot!

796
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,780
(I missed my target.)

797
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,980
I didn't do it on purpose.

798
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,380
- Same here.
 - I'm sorry.

799
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,120
- I'm sorry.
 - I didn't do it on purpose.

800
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,280
- I didn't do it on purpose.
 - Yes, you did!

801
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,900
- I aimed wrong.
 - Are you mad?

802
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,220
- I'm sorry.
 - Are you mad?

803
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,680
- Are you mad?
 - No, I'm not.

804
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
- I missed my target.
 - Look at this.

805
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,020
Look at this.

806
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,580
- I'm so angry.
 - Are you mad?

807
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,680
No, I'm not.

808
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,380
I knew it. He doesn't get mad.

809
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,780
We'll go to the restaurant I picked, right?

810
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,980
- Yes.
 - Okay.

811
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,780
Will you use the chance now?

812
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,480
- No.
 - Not now.

813
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,380
- Yes.
 - No, we won't.

814
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
- We have to use it in Jejudo.
 - That's right.

815
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,780
- Let's go to Geumho-dong.
 - Yes.

816
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,120
We have to go there.

817
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,080
Because I need to use the bathroom.

818
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,020
(I have to take care of a business.)

819
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,090
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

820
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,680
- Let's go!
 - We have to go with Kwang Soo.

821
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,780
- Let's go.
 - Wait.

822
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,980
You never ask my opinion.

823
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,880
The good restaurant I know...

824
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,480
Why does it have to be my place?

825
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
It's your house.

826
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,320
- Your opinion doesn't matter.
 - It's my house.

827
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
- Who suggested?
 - Wasn't it delicious?

828
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,680
- It was really delicious.
 - So we're going to your house.

829
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,580
My choice is your house.

830
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,420
(Seven Spoons)

831
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,750
(They're on their way to Kwang Soo's place.)

832
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,580
We'll have to do everything in my house, won't we?

833
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,350
Yes.

834
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,480
(Sighing)

835
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
I'll move back to my parents' house.

836
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,750
I can't live like this.

837
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,280
I don't know...

838
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,180
how to react to...

839
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
someone who's coming to...

840
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,980
my house for toilet.

841
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,580
You're the only one who thinks your house is your private space.

842
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,920
We eat chicken kalguksu in Geumho-dong and...

843
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,180
go to Jejudo Island using the chance.

844
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,780
Going to Muan is the problem.

845
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,680
We might get the eraser chance.

846
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,010
- We could erase that.
 - Yes.

847
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,480
Wouldn't it be better to erase...

848
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,280
- Muan instead of Jejudo Island?
 - Muan is better.

849
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,480
You should be glad I picked Kwang Soo's place.

850
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,620
Seriously, it was a good choice.

851
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,320
(Chicken kalguksu, Kwang Soo's house)

852
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,180
Is this the famous place?

853
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,880
This is the place I know.

854
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,120
Why did you pick here?

855
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,680
To be honest, I can't...

856
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,280
remember the name of the seafood kalguksu place.

857
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,920
But why did you pick my place?

858
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,780
- Look. It's a game.
 - What's that?

859
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,980
What?

860
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,120
It's a game.

861
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,980
- What is this?
 - If we do it, do we get more time?

862
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,180
The option you chose was...

863
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,380
- "It Has To Be Me".
 - Right.

864
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,580
Cover your eyes. Whoever jumps over the long stick...

865
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,780
without dropping it can eat kalguksu.

866
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,880
- Really?
 - If I fail, I don't have to eat?

867
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,380
Whoever fails doesn't even need to enter my house, right?

868
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,780
(I will succeed.)

869
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,380
- Jong Kook.
 - Shall I go?

870
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,580
(Jong Kook is first.)

871
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,780
- Go ahead.
 - It'll be hard.

872
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,580
(He walks forward with his eyes covered.)

873
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,980
How is that even possible?

874
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,930
- Is that possible?
 - How?

875
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,180
Go straight.

876
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,280
- Keep going.
 - Go straight.

877
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,220
- Take two more steps.
 - You have to go over it.

878
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,880
Go over it. That's it.

879
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,480
(Taking big steps...)

880
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,580
- Wow.
 - Oh, my.

881
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,080
(Haha also manages to succeed.)

882
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,380
- Go for it.
 - That's it. Big steps.

883
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,480
- Big steps.
 - Goodness.

884
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,180
(Everyone succeeds in order to visit Kwang Soo's place.)

885
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,080
- That's it.
 - Okay.

886
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,180
(Jae Seok even manages to jump over.)

887
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,320
Goodness.

888
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,350
How did you do that?

889
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,080
This is too easy, right?

890
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
- Yes,
 - Yes.

891
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,680
(Jae Seok is fooling around.)

892
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,380
Stop right there.

893
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,780
You're nearly there now.

894
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,680
You have to take big steps. Big ones.

895
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,780
Make big steps.

896
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,780
- You're there. You're touching it.
 - Move a little to the left.

897
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,380
- Move a little to the left.
 - No, no.

898
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,880
(Struggling)

899
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,580
(What is this?)

900
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,880
- You come over here.
 - Are you mad?

901
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,180
Yes, I am mad.

902
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,780
(Yes, I am mad.)

903
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,280
(He looks like he could fall ill from anger.)

904
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,880
Goodness.

905
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,380
Yes, I am mad.

906
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,980
- In 1, 2, 3, 4...
 - Going 3, 4...

907
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,250
- Higher.
 - That's it.

908
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,380
That's it. Higher.

909
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,450
(It was close, but he succeeded.)

910
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,180
- Did I make it?
 - Success.

911
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,350
You can go in and order the dishes you want to enjoy.

912
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,750
- Really?
 - Can't we order in advance?

913
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,480
- If we check the time...
 - They do good food.

914
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,170
- Isn't it?
 - The soy sauce is really good.

915
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,380
Where is it again?

916
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,580
(Where is Kwang Soo's apartment?)

917
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,680
What's interesting is that all the staff know where Kwang Soo lives.

918
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,880
- It's that way.
 - That way.

919
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,080
I lived here for 2 years and we've shot here 6 times already.

920
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,380
(It must be kind of a film set to be shot 6 times in 2 years.)

921
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,080
- You did a live broadcast once too.
 - How did you know it's that way?

922
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,480
(How did you know it's that way?)

923
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,880
How did you know it?

924
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,280
(The staff know of the shortcuts.)

925
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,150
- They've been here so many times.
 - They know the way off by heart.

926
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,780
Goodness, your home.

927
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,080
How did you find the way by yourselves?

928
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,980
(They finally enter Kwang Soo's apartment.)

929
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
- The next door...
 - You all know the door code, right?

930
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,580
- You all know the code, right?
 - Let me do it.

931
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,780
- Since the owner is here.
 - The owner is here.

932
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,380
I know the door code too.

933
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,580
(Kwang Soo opens the door.)

934
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,380
This is really...

935
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,180
I call second for the toilet.

936
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,380
I call next in line after you.

937
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,180
Your house looks better.

938
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,980
Kwang Soo.

939
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,480
(Last spring,)

940
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,180
(they had a surprise housewarming party.)

941
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,280
(Surprise!)

942
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,380
- It's a housewarming party.
 - Hello.

943
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,380
Kwang Soo, do you sleep over here?

944
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,980
I have a right to search here.

945
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,450
To search what?

946
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,980
What is this?

947
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,750
What do you think you're doing?

948
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,120
What are you guys doing?

949
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,350
Everyone, get out.

950
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,880
(It was still an unfamiliar place at that time. )

951
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,980
(Now it's become so familiar.)

952
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,380
I'm not even shocked any more.

953
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,980
(Now it's become so familiar.)

954
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,150
- The view is great up here.
 - It looks better than last time.

955
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,480
- Pardon?
 - Did you buy this?

956
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,580
- Yes, recently.
 - First,

957
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
I need to use the toilet, Kwang Soo.

958
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,940
Okay, Jae Seok.

959
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,140
- There is someone on the bed.
 - What are you doing?

960
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,880
(There is someone on the bed?)

961
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,450
Someone is on the bed.

962
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,380
Stop talking nonsense.

963
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,780
I'm telling the truth.

964
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,180
See, someone's lying down under the covers.

965
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,680
(What is that on the bed?)

966
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,320
- That surprised me.
 - Me too.

967
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,950
I was surprised too.

968
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,480
You startled me.

969
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,980
(It was a bunch of pillows.)

970
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,080
I thought someone was under the covers.

971
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,580
(Kwang Soo, please tidy up your bed.)

972
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,780
Why did you leave it like that?

973
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,480
I don't know. I was so busy in the morning.

974
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
- You're going to be very free.
 - Jae Seok.

975
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,280
- Jae Seok.
 - Yes?

976
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,480
Can I use it first?

977
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
All right, you use it first.

978
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,180
(Wait a minute.)

979
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,780
His house smells different.

980
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,180
(His house smells different.)

981
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,380
What?

982
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,980
It's the scented candles.

983
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,780
As soon as possible, please.

984
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,380
- Yes, thank you.
 - Kwang Soo.

985
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
- I have a really...
 - Jae Seok.

986
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,480
sensitive nose.

987
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,150
It's because of the scented candle.

988
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,480
It smells like he had a woman over.

989
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,250
- It's not that.
 - It smells like a woman's perfume.

990
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,580
It's because of this candle.

991
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,780
(It's no woman but this candle, I tell you.)

992
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,080
Stop talking nonsense.

993
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,780
(Stop talking nonsense and just have your chicken kalguksu.)

994
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,180
- Really.
 - All right, then.

995
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,380
- It's because...
 - What are you setting up?

996
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,690
What is this that you're setting up?

997
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,150
(The place looks like a film set.)

998
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,380
- We don't have much time left.
 - Are you remodelling the place?

999
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,050
What is this?

1000
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,980
- Are you remodelling the place?
 - This looks dangerous.

1001
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,180
What are you doing?

1002
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,320
- I'm back.
 - All right.

1003
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,190
Kwang Soo, did you order the chicken kalguksu?

1004
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,670
I did.

1005
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,380
Ask them to be quick. We only have 8 hours and 30 minutes.

1006
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,920
- You're right.
 - We're in trouble.

1007
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,380
(Come here, chicken kalguksu)

1008
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,980
Do we need to order it now?

1009
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,480
- We already ordered it.
 - We ordered it.

1010
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
- Did we order?
 - Yes, we did.

1011
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,380
(Screaming)

1012
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,490
(A scream is heard in the midst of silence.)

1013
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,080
- He's giving birth.
 - Jae Seok.

1014
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,580
You can do that at the next place.

1015
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,880
Goodness.

1016
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,580
He always leaves behind something.

1017
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
Is it his first time in a few months?

1018
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,080
(What was that scream?)

1019
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,150
I dozed off.

1020
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,190
- What?
 - I dozed off.

1021
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,190
(It's so warm and comfortable.)

1022
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,780
- Why would you do that?
 - It's so warm in here.

1023
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
(He is very satisfied.)

1024
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,150
I love this house.

1025
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,580
(What do you mean?)

1026
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,880
- Jae Seok.
 - What are you talking about?

1027
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,180
- Don't close the door.
 - Come on.

1028
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,280
- Gary.
 - Why?

1029
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,480
It's not what you think it is.

1030
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,690
(Don't worry.)

1031
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,990
Something here makes it work.

1032
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,980
This place is paradise of excretion.

1033
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,080
(This place is paradise.)

1034
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,320
What are you talking about?

1035
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,480
Why would you name my home like that?

1036
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,350
I designate this place...

1037
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,690
as our sacred place of constipation.

1038
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,580
The association of constipation will call you soon.

1039
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,880
You are appointed as the manager of this sacred place.

1040
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,880
(Kwang Soo is appointed the manager of sacred place of constipation.)

1041
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,380
You have been appointed.

1042
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,950
No, this place is not related to any of that.

1043
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,450
(The door bell rings at that moment.)

1044
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,380
- It's here.
 - It's here.

1045
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,320
- It's quick.
 - The scenery is really nice.

1046
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
(The chicken kalguksu is here.)

1047
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,880
The view is really nice.

1048
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,080
Isn't it nice?

1049
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,380
Get ready to go.

1050
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,480
(Get ready to go.)

1051
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,580
Bring the dishes then.

1052
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,690
It's like the newlywed's home.

1053
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,980
- Kwang Soo.
 - You two are like a married couple.

1054
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,990
Can we shoot "We Got Married" here?

1055
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,940
Why would you do it here?

1056
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,690
Why does my home look like a newlywed's home?

1057
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,380
I know the place.

1058
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,580
Yes, it's perfect.

1059
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,080
Let's shoot it here.

1060
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,880
- Hello.
 - Hello.

1061
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,280
Here you go.

1062
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,980
We're really big eaters.

1063
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,580
- Thank you.
 - Enjoy your meal.

1064
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,690
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

1065
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,480
- Enjoy the meal.
 - I recommended this place.

1066
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,380
- Jae Seok loves this.
 - Yes.

1067
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,780
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

1068
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,320
- I wish you all the best.
 - Thank you.

1069
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,080
- You two prepare it.
 - Yes.

1070
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,580
Shoot a mini "We Got Married".

1071
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,690
(Gary and Ji Hyo are given the chicken kalguksu.)

1072
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,780
- If this were real...
 - Honey?

1073
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,680
I hope to see a serious version of this later.

1074
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,880
(Here is the chicken kalguksu.)

1075
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,680
There's a lot of soup.

1076
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,580
Isn't it your first time doing this?

1077
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,780
(Lovey dovey)

1078
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,780
- Of course I've done this before.
 - Is that so?

1079
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,380
(When it boils, it's ready to eat.)

1080
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,450
Not any where else but you have to eat it at Kwang Soo's.

1081
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,780
- Who wrote Jejudo Island?
 - But...

1082
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,690
- Haha.
 - I like Jejudo Island too,

1083
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,870
but on a day like this, you should have known better.

1084
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,380
Look who's talking.

1085
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,680
- What?
 - So you wrote down my home?

1086
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,480
Look, Kwang Soo.

1087
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,380
The route is perfect.

1088
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,190
First, it was Samseong-dong, then Apgujeong then Geumho-dong.

1089
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,080
- And then Jejudo Island.
 - Stop going to the toilet.

1090
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,780
What took you so long?

1091
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,580
- Touch.
 - How many times are you flushing?

1092
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,380
(Haha goes in next.)

1093
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,980
- Look.
 - Give 30 dollars when you leave.

1094
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,480
Why are you having a toilet party at my house?

1095
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,050
You should leave the door open.

1096
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,450
So that when our colleagues...

1097
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,690
come over, they can ask to use the toilet.

1098
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,350
They would have heard...

1099
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,280
about the rumour.

1100
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,780
Is this the famous Kwang Soo's toilet?

1101
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,460
Who's up next?

1102
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,990
(I feel refreshed.)

1103
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,980
Kwang Soo,

1104
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,480
don't you love having company around?

1105
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,690
(Don't you love having company around?)

1106
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,320
Right?

1107
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,480
Isn't it nice having people around?

1108
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,950
I almost forgot it was my home.

1109
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,080
(How nice is this to have company?)

1110
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
It should be filled with people.

1111
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,880
- I saw you go like this.
 - Gary.

1112
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,580
Ji Hyo is really nice.

1113
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,550
(She seems lady-like.)

1114
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,380
- The soup is ready.
 - It's ready.

1115
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,580
This...

1116
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,880
Everyone,

1117
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,350
enjoy the food I recommended!

1118
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,080
- Wow.
 - Okay, let's go!

1119
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,820
It'll be really tasty.

1120
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,780
Let's enjoy.

1121
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,980
- Sit down.
 - Look at this.

1122
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,580
- There's a whole chicken inside.
 - Although there wasn't much fat...

1123
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,280
A few days ago,

1124
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,350
- Come and sit down.
 - it was Seok Jin's birthday.

1125
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,780
We weren't prepared to give him a present then so we all chipped in...

1126
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,980
and prepared a present for him today.

1127
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,250
Congratulations.

1128
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:37,190
Happy birthday to you

1129
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,780
- Happy birthday, dear Seok Jin
 - Are you going to give it to him?

1130
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,880
- Are you going to give now?
 - Happy birthday to you

1131
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,690
You shouldn't have.

1132
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,880
Surprise.

1133
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,250
We were so sorry that we missed out,

1134
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,480
- so we've prepared an oven glove.
 - It's quite cold these days.

1135
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,690
Try it on.

1136
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,880
(An oven glove right out of Kwang Soo's kitchen.)

1137
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,980
- It must be cold.
 - You have to wear it.

1138
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,080
You have to.

1139
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,580
(The prank succeeded.)

1140
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,080
Try it on.

1141
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,270
- I thought it was for real.
 - His face is so red.

1142
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,080
I really thought it was for real.

1143
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,690
- Try it on.
 - Come on, try it on.

1144
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,690
Seok Jin, try it on. We all chipped in to buy this.

1145
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,750
- You should wear it all day.
 - Wear it all day today.

1146
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,050
What's this?

1147
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,350
(One of the glove is already burnt.)

1148
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,190
- Happy belated birthday.
 - This is heartwarming.

1149
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,580
(This is a real heartwarming birthday party.)

1150
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,190
- I really thought...
 - Seok Jin really thought...

1151
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,690
- His face was so red.
 - This is really...

1152
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,780
Don't do this again.

1153
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,840
I was worried how to react.

1154
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,150
- This is really tasty.
 - I'm not kidding. Have a taste.

1155
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,980
- We keep on having noodles.
 - Three in a row.

1156
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,780
Haha, the funny thing is that I have room for more.

1157
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,880
We have room for more.

1158
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,780
Here's a chicken breast for Jong Kook.

1159
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,460
I'll have it.

1160
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,280
(Now that they're full, they've become childish.)

1161
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,690
- This looks great.
 - Let's enjoy.

1162
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,680
- It looks great.
 - There must be a drumstick in here.

1163
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,980
How's the noodles?

1164
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,080
- It's good.
 - It's well cooked.

1165
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,480
(They enjoy the chicken kalguksu.)

1166
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
I'm so full.

1167
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,680
This is the best.

1168
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,750
It only tastes good at Kwang Soo's.

1169
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,270
- I get what you mean.
 - Do you see what I mean?

1170
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,950
- How many drumsticks did you eat?
 - Two.

1171
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,480
There are only two.

1172
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,980
How can you eat both without asking?

1173
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,080
- You should've offered.
 - Do you want one?

1174
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,980
- You eat it.
 - Do you want one?

1175
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,580
Okay.

1176
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,380
I feel uncomfortable about eating it.

1177
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,690
Gosh...

1178
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,480
Are you upset?

1179
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,080
- Are you?
 - Are you angry?

1180
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,250
- He's upset.
 - I just felt uncomfortable.

1181
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,160
Are you upset?

1182
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,980
Why would you get upset because of that?

1183
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,690
Jong Kook, I feel so uncomfortable. You eat the drumstick.

1184
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,680
I feel so uncomfortable.

1185
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,250
- I feel uncomfortable.
 - You eat it.

1186
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,320
No, it's okay. I don't have to eat it.

1187
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,780
I will eat it then.

1188
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,080
Is it okay? Do you want the drumstick?

1189
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,250
No, it's okay.

1190
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,690
Tell me. Jae Seok?

1191
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,750
- I don't want it.
 - Okay.

1192
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,250
- That was really good.
 - It was great.

1193
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,120
We are done.

1194
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,180
Let's pick a chance.

1195
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,580
- The eraser chance is the best.
 - Let's erase Jejudo Island.

1196
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,220
(The eraser chance is the best.)

1197
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,580
- Ji Hyo.
 - I don't know. I just chose it.

1198
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
- Okay.
 - Good job.

1199
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,770
What is it?

1200
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,190
It must be a good one.

1201
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,690
Separation chance!

1202
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,380
That's a good one.

1203
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,980
You're amazing.

1204
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,220
So we have to go to Jejudo Island.

1205
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,480
We have to go to Jejudo Island.

1206
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,580
Who wants to go?

1207
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,780
Let's pick who will go.

1208
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,280
- Are we really going?
 - Let's pick who will go.

1209
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,490
- Let's pick it.
 - Let's be fair.

1210
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,380
I'll mark two sticks. Give me one more.

1211
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,490
- I always get picked.
 - Me too.

1212
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,120
Raise your hand if you want to go.

1213
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,580
Let the volunteer go.

1214
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,380
Let's see if there's a volunteer.

1215
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,480
There may be someone who wants to go. Right?

1216
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,280
All right, everyone.

1217
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,380
We will pick two people to go to Jejudo Island.

1218
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,990
- Don't look at it yet.
 - Okay.

1219
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,520
Please...

1220
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,780
- I don't know.
 - Don't look at it yet.

1221
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,980
- It's on this side.
 - You would know.

1222
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,180
I will just pick one.

1223
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,780
Should we check it together?

1224
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,580
I think I'm going.

1225
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,280
- I don't know either.
 - Don't look at it.

1226
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,480
Don't look at it.

1227
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,980
When will we go there?

1228
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,480
(Jejudo Island is good. But it's going to be very tiring.)

1229
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,580
- I really can't go.
 - I hope it's not me.

1230
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,920
I'll get the last one.

1231
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,690
Please.

1232
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,250
I'm really scared to ride an aeroplane.

1233
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,080
- Let's check one by one.
 - I will go first.

1234
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,220
Please!

1235
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,380
(What will be Gary's fate?)

1236
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,480
There!

1237
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,920
Is there nothing?

1238
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,690
- It's him.
 - It says Jejudo Island.

1239
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,980
Yes!

1240
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,180
- Yes!
 - Now one is out.

1241
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,120
- Please.
 - Seok Jin, you're next.

1242
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,690
(Seok Jin passes.)

1243
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,180
It's not there.

1244
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,120
- Next is Jong Kook.
 - This is crazy.

1245
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,650
How could I pick that?

1246
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,220
And you were the first one to pick.

1247
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,980
(Jong Kook passes too.)

1248
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,280
- It's not there?
 - You have a big smile.

1249
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,690
- It should be Haha.
 - It's not there.

1250
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,280
It's not there! Yes!

1251
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,120
- It's not there.
 - Maybe it's going to be me?

1252
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,480
If Ji Hyo picks it, she's meant to be with Gary.

1253
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,420
In 1, 2, 3.

1254
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,580
- It's not there.
 - It's not there.

1255
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,690
- Hey...
 - It's one of them.

1256
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,580
Check it at the same time.

1257
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,780
- Gosh...
 - This is crazy.

1258
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,490
In 1, 2, 3.

1259
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,980
(Who will be the one to go to Jejudo Island?)

1260
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,680
Three.

1261
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,380
Three.

1262
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,580
(Ji Hyo is picked.)

1263
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,690
- Who is it?
 - It's Ji Hyo.

1264
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,380
I'm going with Ji Hyo!

1265
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,780
- It's Ji Hyo?
 - Really?

1266
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,350
- I got goosebumps.
 - It's really Ji HYo?

1267
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,970
Chen Bolin,

1268
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,190
you're out.

1269
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,690
You guys are meant to be together.

1270
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,780
Stop it!

1271
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,880
(Gary and Ji Hyo are going to Jejudo Island!)

1272
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,280
Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1273
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,260
Let's go to Jejudo and get some fresh air.

1274
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,320
I never thought I'd go to Jejudo Island with you.

1275
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,580
I saw it coming.

1276
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,880
I really didn't think I was going to pick it.

1277
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,180
This is crazy.

1278
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,980
(They are meant to be together.)

1279
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,380
I never thought...

1280
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,780
we would go on a trip like this.

1281
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,420
I know, right?

1282
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,620
This is...

1283
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,880
crazy.

1284
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,780
(The crew is serious.)

1285
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,180
What should we do?

1286
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,580
It's snowing in Jejudo Island.

1287
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,090
Really? Just don't tell them.

1288
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,170
- That's even better.
 - That's not it.

1289
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,480
Maybe they will go to Jejudo Island...

1290
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,360
and really fall in love.

1291
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,680
They will be falling in love after six years.

1292
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,160
This is a heavenly chance.

1293
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,380
Gary shouldn't miss this chance.

1294
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,480
There are many people who get stuck in Jejudo Island.

1295
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,910
They get stuck?

1296
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,080
Because of snow storm,

1297
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,180
flights get cancelled, and they get stuck for 3 or 4 days.

1298
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,780
If we get stuck there for three days, what should we do?

1299
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,480
(If we get stuck there for three days, what should we do?)

1300
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,040
What do you mean?

1301
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,780
It's been a while since I said it. What do you mean?

1302
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,580
(What do you mean by that?)

1303
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,980
Since we are going there anyway, let's have fun.

1304
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,580
Yes. Let's just think that we're going there on a trip.

1305
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,180
Get some fresh air in Jejudo

1306
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,450
In a place where there is no one

1307
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,010
But it's really fascinating that Gary and Ji Hyo got picked.

1308
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,180
- It's not easy.
 - It's not.

1309
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,280
It's really not easy.

1310
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,380
What's the probability?

1311
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,680
It's two-sevenths.

1312
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,780
You're right. It's not too big.

1313
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,650
What is the probability of Ji Hyo and Gary going to Jejudo Island?

1314
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,480
There's a very small probability.

1315
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,680
Are you upset?

1316
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,480
Why don't you...

1317
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,180
- Why don't you get help?
 - I can't say anything to you.

1318
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,780
You're addicted to getting upset.

1319
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,420
I think you have an anger management issue.

1320
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,180
(I'm not smiling right now.)

1321
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,180
We're here!

1322
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,520
Let's go to Jejudo Island.

1323
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,880
(They already got the airplane ticket.)

1324
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,680
Can't we just take a camera with us?

1325
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,770
Do you have to follow us around?

1326
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,550
(Gosh...)

1327
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,550
It's too uncomfortable.

1328
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,680
Why are you uncomfortable? They are our team.

1329
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,880
The crew should rest.

1330
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,780
We could film ourselves. There's no problem with that.

1331
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,680
(The crew is so slow-witted.)

1332
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,480
The last flight is at 9:30pm.

1333
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,880
It's 9:15pm.

1334
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,280
I see.

1335
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,580
Let's leave together

1336
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,680
- Only the two of us
 - Only the two of us

1337
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,180
- Let's forget everything
 - Let's forget everything

1338
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,750
Let's plough a field

1339
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,620
And grow tangerines together

1340
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,180
You said it. You said we should farm tangerines together.

1341
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,180
If you really

1342
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,420
Feel alone

1343
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,420
(She's excited.)

1344
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,980
Should I take a swimming suit?

1345
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,380
- We can buy a swimming suit.
 - Okay.

1346
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,380
- We don't have to take anything.
 - I'm so excited right now.

1347
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,450
Why are you excited?

1348
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,880
(He's too excited.)

1349
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,880
I can wear a triangle swimsuit.

1350
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,120
(He confesses.)

1351
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,980
(He's too excited.)

1352
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,280
(What kind of a journey is awaiting them?)

1353
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,040
(The two of them will get to look at the Jeju sea together.)

1354
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:13,420
(They can drive along the shore and ride a horse.)

1355
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,780
(Wait for us, Jejudo.)

1356
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,780
Bye, Gary.

1357
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,620
Take a nap.

1358
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,620
Don't you think you said bye too early?

1359
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,370
You should wait at least...

1360
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,280
until the seatbelt sign is off. That was way too fast.

1361
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,960
I think you will be like that even on a honeymoon.

1362
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,580
Bye, Honey.

1363
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,680
We're here.

1364
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,980
Let's go.

1365
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,520
(The five members arrive at the next restaurant.)

1366
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,480
(It's a barbecue restaurant recommended by Jong Kook.)

1367
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,680
(It's located in Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul.)

1368
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,580
This is tough.

1369
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,220
(They will eat one order of meat barbecue.)

1370
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,120
First is Jong Kook. Second is me.

1371
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,780
Third is Haha, and fourth is Kwang Soo.

1372
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,220
Let's sit in the order.

1373
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,650
Okay.

1374
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,580
(They sat in the order.)

1375
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,180
Jae Seok, are you hungry? Or are you full?

1376
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,580
I'm full.

1377
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,350
(All of them are full.)

1378
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,580
- Looking at the grill,
 - Thank you.

1379
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,220
- I feel hungry again.
 - When you see it,

1380
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,680
you will say, "That's it?"

1381
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,480
- That's it?
 - It's going to be delicious.

1382
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,860
One order is too small.

1383
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,170
- That's one order?
 - I will eat it alone.

1384
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,180
- No, it's okay.
 - No.

1385
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,680
- I should eat it.
 - Which part is it?

1386
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,480
- I will eat it.
 - Hold on.

1387
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,320
- Jong Kook loves it.
 - It's beef.

1388
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,980
- It's not about being loyal.
 - It's the opposite.

1389
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,480
He could eat everything alone.

1390
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,180
You know I wrote beef as my favourite health food, right?

1391
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,380
I'm sure we can eat one piece each.

1392
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,580
- You have to let me eat too.
 - I can eat all of that alone.

1393
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,080
- Me too.
 - Me too.

1394
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,680
This is what life is about.

1395
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,230
(He's got all the authority.)

1396
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,680
Get me a drink.

1397
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,380
Give me some.

1398
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,780
I feel like drinking when I can't even drink.

1399
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,550
- Gosh...
 - That looks delicious.

1400
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,480
It's the opposite.

1401
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,280
I'll eat the parts with less fat.

1402
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,480
(They just stare at the meat.)

1403
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,910
That looks delicious.

1404
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,880
- You're going to eat only those?
 - No.

1405
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,380
Gosh, he's going to eat everything.

1406
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,580
Why are we looking at you eating?

1407
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,180
I heard you have a good personality.

1408
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,280
Yes.

1409
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,780
Then you should be considerate of the others.

1410
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm doing this because it might be too hard for you.

1411
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,780
- You're worried.
 - That's why I'm eating these.

1412
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,420
This is driving me crazy.

1413
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,380
- That looks so delicious.
 - Being full doesn't matter.

1414
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,150
Let's make an acrostic poem with the word "beef".

1415
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,760
Go on.

1416
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,380
I love beef.

1417
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,880
Next is Haha.

1418
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,980
What's wrong?

1419
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,680
(He got eliminated on the first verse.)

1420
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,250
- I had it all planned out.
 - But the start was...

1421
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,480
I had it all planned out.

1422
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,250
The start was too terrible.

1423
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,380
(That was enough.)

1424
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,480
I didn't want to hear more.

1425
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,480
I will do something else.

1426
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,120
- Please give me the word.
 - I don't want to listen to it.

1427
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,480
- Please.
 - So.

1428
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,680
Bye, water strider.

1429
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,880
Bye, hedgehog.

1430
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,910
- Ki.
 - Let's go, Ki Sung Yueng!

1431
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,880
What's wrong?

1432
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,980
(He opened a new age of an acrostic poem.)

1433
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,380
I did it.

1434
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,180
"I love beef. Bye, water strider."

1435
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,180
It's cooked.

1436
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,480
- Medium-rare is perfect.
 - Oh, gosh.

1437
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,380
Why do we have to watch him eat?

1438
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,980
- That looks amazing.
 - I'm starting to feel bad.

1439
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,520
I'm happy just by looking at him.

1440
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,480
Does it taste good?

1441
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,980
Is it amazing?

1442
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,080
(It smells fantastic.)

1443
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,180
Do you have to make that face?

1444
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,730
Why are you doing that?

1445
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,180
Aren't we a team?

1446
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,480
What are you doing?

1447
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,850
Why are you teasing us?

1448
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,980
You even closed your eyes.

1449
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,480
Only if it wasn't Seok Jin after me.

1450
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,580
I would leave some meat if it wasn't Seok Jin's turn after me.

1451
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,880
I'll have to finish everything.

1452
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,580
- What do you mean?
 - Do you have something against me?

1453
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,880
Would you leave some if it was Haha after you?

1454
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,980
I would.

1455
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,070
- What about for me?
 - Of course I would.

1456
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,580
- What about me?
 - Not for you.

1457
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,680
(Not for you.)

1458
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,380
Of course not.

1459
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,580
Why do you even ask?

1460
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,620
Stop cooking.

1461
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,880
Are you going to put more?

1462
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,950
(The beef is almost gone.)

1463
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,780
- Should I stop?
 - You don't have to do this for me.

1464
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,980
What are you saying?

1465
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,250
That was it. He's a nice man.

1466
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,450
He was grilling them for us all.

1467
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,180
He's grilling them for us.

1468
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,680
- He won't eat them all.
 - Of course not.

1469
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,780
Of course not.

1470
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,680
I needed some protein.

1471
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,080
(It's yummy.)

1472
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,350
How can he make that face?

1473
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,380
(The beef must be very sour.)

1474
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,480
This is unbelievable.

1475
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,580
He's so cruel.

1476
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,900
(He opened his eyes to beef.)

1477
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,480
How can he do that?

1478
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,920
(Appreciating the flavour)

1479
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,480
This is amazing.

1480
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,120
Are you going to stop now?

1481
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,280
No.

1482
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,350
- There's nothing left.
 - It's almost gone.

1483
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,850
There's nothing left.

1484
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,050
There are eight pieces left.

1485
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,480
(Eight pieces left)

1486
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,450
Each of us will get two pieces.

1487
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,250
Do you want a piece?

1488
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,380
Me?

1489
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,150
It'll be my turn next.

1490
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,580
What makes you think that you'll get to eat?

1491
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,480
Seok Jin rarely gets this good result in games.

1492
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,580
I came in second place after a long time.

1493
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,080
But I don't think I'll get to eat.

1494
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,120
Seok Jin won't get to eat after all.

1495
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,380
Exactly.

1496
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,480
He was happy when he came in second place.

1497
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,580
I'm sure he'll never get angry.

1498
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,750
(Seok Jin will not get angry.)

1499
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,780
You're right.

1500
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,920
Why do I never get to eat?

1501
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,080
- Are you getting hungry?
 - Seriously.

1502
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,280
Why do I never get to eat?

1503
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,580
(One of the last pieces goes onto the grill.)

1504
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,380
No way.

1505
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,580
- He won't do this.
 - Fine. Finish it.

1506
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,750
- No way.
 - Finish it.

1507
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,280
Jong Kook, finish it all.

1508
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,480
Sir, finish it.

1509
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,580
Sir Kim Jong Kook, calm down.

1510
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,750
Jong Kook.

1511
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,170
- Calm down.
 - Jong Kook, eat them all.

1512
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,280
- Jong Kook, finish them.
 - He won't.

1513
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,850
- Calm down.
 - No way.

1514
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,980
(What will happen to the remaining three pieces?)

1515
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,880
(One of them is gone.)

1516
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,890
(Are you really doing this?)

1517
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,880
There are two pieces left.

1518
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,180
(One of the two is gone.)

1519
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,580
How could you...

1520
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,980
(There's nothing left for me now.)

1521
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,880
(The last piece)

1522
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,180
(Seok Jin)

1523
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,990
(It's not over yet.)

1524
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,580
He'll cut it for you.

1525
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,180
I will.

1526
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,380
- Really?
 - I was about to.

1527
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,480
Okay.

1528
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,980
Can you not cut it into three pieces?

1529
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,550
I knew it.

1530
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,680
Is that it?

1531
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,850
It's fat.

1532
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,980
Excuse me. What are you doing?

1533
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,160
(He's cutting the fat out.)

1534
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,580
This is not what the game is about.

1535
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,780
I'm such a loyal man.

1536
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,250
(Jong Kook finished all the meat for his team members.)

1537
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,750
Let's move onto the next.

1538
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,280
Can we eat what you left?

1539
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,250
It's my turn.

1540
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,180
(Seok Jin did taste the meat after all.)

1541
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,380
We have five hours left.

1542
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,480
(The remaining time)

1543
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,280
I saved some time.

1544
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,580
I feel great.

1545
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,060
All right.

1546
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,050
Will you use a chance now?

1547
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,880
We should.

1548
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,380
- We should.
 - We have only two places left.

1549
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,780
We have to visit 2 more places and we have 2 chances left.

1550
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,780
Let's complete our mission in Ganghwado first.

1551
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,050
And use the two remaining chances there.

1552
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,950
- We can use two.
 - That's right.

1553
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,980
Let's go.

1554
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,780
- Let's have some good food there.
 - Let's go.

1555
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,920
- Let's go there first.
 - Let's go.

1556
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,270
If we use the 2 chances there, we could skip 1 place.

1557
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,380
That's a great idea. I'm so full.

1558
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,980
We'll eat eel soon.

1559
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,280
(Meanwhile, Gary and Ji Hyo...)

1560
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,850
Ladies and gentlemen.

1561
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,450
We arrived at Jeju International Airport.

1562
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,280
(Wait.)

1563
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,380
(The sky is...)

1564
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,280
(full of dark clouds.)

1565
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,750
Jejudo is having the coldest winter in 32 years.

1566
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,220
The heavy snow has blocked most of the roads...

1567
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,580
and there have been many power failures.

1568
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,420
All roads in Mount Halla are blocked.

1569
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,080
(We're doomed.)

1570
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,780
(There will be no romance in Jejudo.)

1571
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,780
(Disappointed)

1572
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,180
I didn't expect this.

1573
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,280
Me neither.

1574
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,180
- This is not right.
 - Before we left,

1575
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,280
the weather was fantastic.

1576
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,180
It was great before we left.

1577
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,950
It's freezing!

1578
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,250
(Welcome to the frozen island.)

1579
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,980
It's even colder than Seoul.

1580
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,080
The wind is so cold.

1581
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,380
It's snowing. Look.

1582
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,170
- It's snowing.
 - It really is.

1583
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,080
It's snowing in Jejudo.

1584
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,780
My goodness.

1585
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,870
(How can this happen?)

1586
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,250
It's snowing in Jejudo.

1587
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,050
- Is it here?
 - It's here. I've been here.

1588
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,150
(They arrived at the eel restaurant in Ganghwado.)

1589
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,820
This place is amazing.

1590
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,380
I recommended this place.

1591
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,250
I've been here a couple of times.

1592
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,380
(Recommended by Seok Jin, an eel restaurant in Ganghwado)

1593
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,220
I recommended this place.

1594
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,280
It'll be amazing.

1595
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,950
This place is great.

1596
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,880
How much time do we have?

1597
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,550
We have 4 hours and 20 minutes.

1598
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,580
- With that little time left,
 - We should hurry.

1599
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,180
This will be our last place.

1600
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,280
Let's eat.

1601
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,050
Give us the food.

1602
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,850
- We have an option here too.
 - We have an option.

1603
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,560
For this place,

1604
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,940
- "Staff".
 - What is it?

1605
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,640
All the staff who came here,

1606
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,780
including your cameramen will eat together.

1607
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,280
Until they're finished,

1608
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,480
you can't leave this place.

1609
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,850
We were going to stop here anyway.

1610
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,380
We were going to stop here.

1611
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,980
- Four hours is enough.
 - It's enough time.

1612
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,850
(Four hours would be enough time for everyone to enjoy the food.)

1613
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,150
For you to move onto the next place,

1614
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,880
the staff have to be finished.

1615
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,480
It's no problem.

1616
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,880
- Eat as much as you want.
 - You can do that.

1617
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,780
One of the cameramen will get married this week.

1618
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,480
He needs to eat a lot.

1619
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,880
(He needs to eat a lot.)

1620
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,850
- We are such big-eaters.
 - How many eels would we have?

1621
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,580
Is she a relative of yours by any chance?

1622
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,280
- No, she isn't.
 - Wait.

1623
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,480
Do I have a big nose?

1624
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,850
"Do I have a big nose?"

1625
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,080
Do you remember me?

1626
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,080
Is this place related to Seok Jin?

1627
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,980
- Never.
 - Never.

1628
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,080
He's our regular customer.

1629
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,480
I come here often.

1630
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,580
Before you start,

1631
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,180
have some eel extract.

1632
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,580
- Sure.
 - Thank you.

1633
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,980
- Thank you.
 - I love eel.

1634
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,180
- Yes!
 - Thank you.

1635
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,680
- It's good for your health.
 - Indeed.

1636
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,280
You never gave this to me before.

1637
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,080
I don't really need this.

1638
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,120
(Laughing)

1639
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,280
Don't lie.

1640
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,250
I already have...

1641
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,580
to much stamina.

1642
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,860
It's not like I can show it to you.

1643
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,380
(Drinking the extract)

1644
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,580
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

1645
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,260
No one leaves anything.

1646
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,680
It's Gary.

1647
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,950
It's a video call.

1648
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,580
- Gary.
 - Guys.

1649
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,080
Guys.

1650
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,280
It's colder here than in Seoul.

1651
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,480
It's snowing here.

1652
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,580
It's snowing.

1653
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,650
(Hilarious)

1654
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,350
- What?
 - It's snowing.

1655
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,380
(Will you be back tonight?)

1656
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,460
Ji Hyo, how is it there?

1657
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,080
The sun has already set.

1658
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,950
Look at the sky.

1659
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,480
It's covered with dark clouds.

1660
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,270
Look at the sky.

1661
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,580
I think the flight will be cancelled.

1662
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,580
No, it won't.

1663
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,580
See you later.

1664
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,080
We won't be back tonight.

1665
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,950
No, we'll see you guys later.

1666
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,380
- We won't see you.
 - We won't.

1667
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,780
Bye.

1668
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,980
(Even the weather is cooperative.)

1669
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,120
- Bye.
 - We won't see you tonight.

1670
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,150
- Gary is smiling.
 - Look at Gary.

1671
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,280
It's nice.

1672
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,680
- He was smiling the whole time.
 - I've never seen him happier.

1673
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,380
This is great.

1674
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,780
(Will this trip bring romance to their relationship?)

1675
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,480
They have made it to Ganghwado at least.

1676
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,780
They made it in time.

1677
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,350
Let's get back as soon as possible.

1678
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,280
I'm more worried about our punishment.

1679
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,780
Kwang Soo wrote "collecting insects" for me.

1680
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,950
As kids, we even ate grasshoppers.

1681
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,120
I can still eat them.

1682
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,950
- Can you?
 - Yes.

1683
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,880
- Really?
 - They're tasty.

1684
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,280
And you're scared of them?

1685
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,080
I just can't touch them.

1686
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,990
Then again, you can be scared of pigs even if you can eat them.

1687
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,480
Exactly.

1688
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,780
You can be scared of birds even if you can eat chicken.

1689
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,180
That makes sense.

1690
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,920
It seems to be here.

1691
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,220
It's here. We're here.

1692
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,480
(They arrived at the kimchi stew place in Jejudo.)

1693
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,680
- Oh, I remember this place.
 - Right?

1694
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,080
Let's go.

1695
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,280
(They came all the way to Jeju Island for kimchi stew.)

1696
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,780
Thank you.

1697
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,780
Look.

1698
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,950
Hello.

1699
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,250
(Recommended by Haha, kimchi stew in Jejudo)

1700
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,180
We're here to try...

1701
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,150
your kimchi stew.

1702
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,380
You've come a long way.

1703
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,080
For this place,

1704
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,280
you chose option "Seven Boxes".

1705
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,950
I think I know what it is.

1706
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,580
I think, in those boxes...

1707
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,920
are tools for us to eat with.

1708
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,580
You have to eat with the tools in the boxes.

1709
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,980
Choose a box you'd like.

1710
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,580
Which do you want?

1711
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,380
I'll take number our.

1712
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,780
- Number four?
 - Yes.

1713
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,050
(Gary chose number four.)

1714
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,740
Thank you. I'll just send one picture.

1715
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,050
Here.

1716
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,250
It didn't feel good when I picked it up.

1717
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,650
Really?

1718
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,850
I don't feel anything.

1719
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,280
(It feels light.)

1720
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,920
I recommend number six.

1721
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,150
Okay, I'll pick number six.

1722
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,480
(If it's a toothpick and teaspoon...)

1723
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,250
- Got it.
 - Here.

1724
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,050
- Here. In 1, 2, 3.
 - Gary, first.

1725
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,580
(What did they choose?)

1726
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,550
In 1, 2, 3.

1727
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,750
This isn't bad!

1728
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,050
But it's hot.

1729
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,380
It's okay. I'm good at using chopsticks.

1730
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,850
(I'm good at using chopsticks.)

1731
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,380
Ji Hyo, please open yours.

1732
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,980
(She got measuring spoons.)

1733
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,560
In order to eat, we have to be together.

1734
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,880
He has chopsticks and...

1735
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,980
(Is it destiny?)

1736
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,250
I have measuring spoons.

1737
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,030
Let's feed each other.

1738
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,480
- Does it taste the same?
 - Yes.

1739
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,150
(They eat with straws and measuring spoons.)

1740
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,780
Put some side dish on top.

1741
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,180
(They have to help each other.)

1742
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,050
- I'll give you some meat.
 - Give me meat and kimchi.

1743
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,780
- Oh no.
 - Gosh.

1744
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,980
I dropped it.

1745
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,050
(It's wasted.)

1746
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,150
(He can't do anything right.)

1747
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:18,050
You need a lot of help.

1748
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,050
Why do we have to eat like this?

1749
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,150
It's driving me nuts.

1750
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,380
(I really want to do well today.)

1751
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,950
- It's good for your health.
 - If that's the case...

1752
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,050
(They start eating grilled eels.)

1753
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,050
- Oh my.
 - Goodness.

1754
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,880
It's sizzling.

1755
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,450
- It looks good.
 - It's really big.

1756
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,720
All the staff members look...

1757
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,350
- happy.
 - They do.

1758
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,120
(It's a good working environment.)

1759
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,450
They look pleased.

1760
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,780
(The eels look delicious.)

1761
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,880
It looks amazing.

1762
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,550
Try eating it with some greens.

1763
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,780
- How is it?
 - It's delicious.

1764
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,750
It's amazing. It's not cooked yet.

1765
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,350
- Gosh.
 - Isn't this done?

1766
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,880
- Put only a bit of salt.
 - This is something new.

1767
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,850
- Put only a bit of salt.
 - Just salt.

1768
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,150
(Look at me.)

1769
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,380
Doesn't it look delicious?

1770
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,270
(It does, doesn't it?)

1771
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,580
(The mud eel has such rich flavour.)

1772
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,680
- You can eat this.
 - Try it.

1773
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,050
How is it?

1774
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,780
It tastes fantastic with greens.

1775
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,150
(It's tasty.)

1776
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,750
It tastes different with different sauces.

1777
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,850
(Thank you, Seok Jin.)

1778
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,680
This is so tasty.

1779
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,840
This is the highlight of the day.

1780
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,050
Gosh.

1781
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,480
Shouldn't we give him a round of applause?

1782
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,580
- Gosh.
 - Thanks.

1783
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,980
(Good job, Seok Jin.)

1784
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,150
This is great.

1785
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,750
Didn't I tell you?

1786
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,950
- Everyone's clapping.
 - Gosh.

1787
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,050
(It's the first time in six years he gets applauded.)

1788
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,550
- I wish Seok Jin pays the bill.
 - Yes.

1789
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,580
(I don't get upset nor do I pay the bill.)

1790
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,150
Let's give a comment.

1791
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,880
Eel,

1792
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,780
what shall I do?

1793
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,150
Eel,

1794
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,720
where have you been?

1795
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,980
That's great.

1796
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,850
Eel,

1797
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,350
how will I sleep?

1798
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,780
(Eel, how will I sleep?)

1799
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,880
(Eels make you sleepless at night.)

1800
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,250
How will I sleep?

1801
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,840
What can I do?

1802
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,750
Eel, are you kidding?

1803
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,580
Gosh, what shall I do?

1804
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,550
(Are you kidding? What shall I do?)

1805
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,280
(Two staff members are still eating.)

1806
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,950
Hey, Gwon Yeol.

1807
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,250
Gwon Yeol.

1808
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,550
Congratulations on your marriage. But shouldn't you stop eating?

1809
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,080
Well,

1810
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,450
they're married men.

1811
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,380
Good luck tonight!

1812
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,650
(Good luck tonight!)

1813
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,180
This is amazing.

1814
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,050
What could be more amazing is...

1815
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,150
(It's time to pick a chance.)

1816
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,150
- If we pick...
 - Yes?

1817
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,780
an eraser chance, there will be no penalty. Am I right?

1818
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,850
- Is that right?
 - Yes.

1819
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,980
- That'd be perfect.
 - It'll be a perfect ending.

1820
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,150
I really want to see Ji Hyo and Gary appear on "We Got Married".

1821
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,880
- I really want to see that.
 - Yes, really.

1822
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,630
(They still want Ji Hyo and Gary to get the penalty.)

1823
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,880
I feel like we were destined to meet each other.

1824
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,180
- Ji Hyo.
 - You have a chopstick...

1825
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,580
and I have a spoon.

1826
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,380
Get a spoonful of rice. I'll give you some side dish.

1827
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,880
(They are already shooting "We Got Married".)

1828
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,050
Why couldn't we have met earlier?

1829
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,920
We finally meet in Jejudo.

1830
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,880
Would we have been closer if we met earlier?

1831
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,050
- Eat your meal.
 - Okay.

1832
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,750
(Eat your meal, Gary.)

1833
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,950
(Don't say things like that at a dinner table.)

1834
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,350
This is hard.

1835
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,650
(Do you want some meat?)

1836
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,280
I'll eat it myself.

1837
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,780
You eat yours.

1838
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,150
(She's mad.)

1839
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,650
Gosh...

1840
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,750
I have to suck the rice that gets inside the straws.

1841
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,150
(I have to eat them later.)

1842
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,750
(I don't want to know.)

1843
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,950
- Do you want kimchi?
 - Yes.

1844
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:54,550
Are you eating slowly on purpose to miss your flight?

1845
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,750
- Miss our flight?
 - What time is it?

1846
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:57,950
(Are you trying to miss your flight?)

1847
01:04:57,950 --> 01:04:59,780
I wasn't even thinking about getting on the plane.

1848
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,650
- What time is it?
 - Let's go to another restaurant.

1849
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,880
I know a place...

1850
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,050
(What are you talking about?)

1851
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,280
I know a place in Seogwipo...

1852
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,150
that's famous for whole chicken soup.

1853
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,180
It's near...

1854
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,680
- a beach.
 - Hey.

1855
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,050
It's eight. We have to eat quickly.

1856
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,560
We have enough time.

1857
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,780
The plane is at 9:30, so we can leave here at 9:30, right?

1858
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,780
(We can leave here at 9:30, can't we?)

1859
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,880
(This place isn't right by the airport.)

1860
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,650
We should leave here at 8:40.

1861
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,050
(Ji Hyo takes Gary's hand.)

1862
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,680
(She puts a ring on his finger.)

1863
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,580
(It's a measuring spoon ring.)

1864
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,980
Is this an engagement ring?

1865
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,420
What are you talking about?

1866
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,050
You...

1867
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,150
(You...)

1868
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,780
You played me for six years like this.

1869
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,980
(Oh goodness)

1870
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,880
Are you going to do this to Chen Bolin?

1871
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,550
You...

1872
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,150
What do you mean I played you?

1873
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,680
This is the first time...

1874
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:04,380
a girl gave me a ring.

1875
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,980
It's a ring from the measuring spoons.

1876
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,650
Anyway, I've never received a ring before.

1877
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,780
- Really?
 - This is the first time.

1878
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,350
This fits perfectly on your pinky.

1879
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,480
(It fits perfectly on your pinky.)

1880
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,450
Are you trying to figure out my ring size?

1881
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,480
(Are you trying to figure out my ring size?)

1882
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,880
My gosh.

1883
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,080
It's 13.

1884
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,750
(A romantic relationship starts in Jejudo.)

1885
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,850
Gary, it's a crab!

1886
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,780
I got one in Dubai!

1887
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,750
- Isn't it pretty?
 - The shell looks like you.

1888
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:38,050
(Is it the real "We Got Married"?)

1889
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,980
- Hey.
 - Stop!

1890
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,850
(Married? No, it's a fight!)

1891
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,050
(It's trouble in the desert.)

1892
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,580
- It's a desert.
 - Gosh.

1893
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,850
It's endless.

1894
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,480
(An exciting adventure in the desert)

1895
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,380
(Running Man goes to Dubai.)

1896
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,250
- This is cool.
 - It's amazing.

1897
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,680
- Isn't it cool?
 - Yes.

1898
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,640
This is really cool.

1899
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,150
I've never eaten so much before.

1900
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,480
Seriously.

1901
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,380
It'll take four hours...

1902
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,480
to get to Muan.

1903
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,580
That's not going to work.

1904
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,150
You have two remaining chances.

1905
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,880
And there are four left that you can pick from.

1906
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,150
- Are there four left?
 - There is an eraser,

1907
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,680
- Okay.
 - delivery,

1908
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,250
avatar and the ability to switch menus.

1909
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,880
Delivery...

1910
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,380
- won't work.
 - No, it won't.

1911
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,880
- That's out of the question.
 - It won't work.

1912
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,820
You can't send an avatar...

1913
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,480
- all the way to Muan.
 - Right.

1914
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,050
- It won't work.
 - Right.

1915
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,250
If you pick the eraser chance...

1916
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,350
- and don't go to Muan,
 - We'd erase it.

1917
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:38,850
- then you all win.
 - Okay.

1918
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,250
- It'll be done.
 - It makes me sad for some reason.

1919
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,580
Okay, then regardless of...

1920
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,980
- Hey, then let's...
 - I'm talking here.

1921
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,150
(I'm talking here.)

1922
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,980
- Are you mad?
 - No.

1923
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,150
- I think you are this time.
 - Really.

1924
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,380
- I think he is.
 - He's mad.

1925
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,950
- He's mad.
 - I saw him get mad.

1926
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,250
Nobody could stand this situation.

1927
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,480
- You should go ahead.
 - No, it's okay.

1928
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,750
- Go ahead.
 - No, it's fine.

1929
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,050
- You should go first.
 - Really?

1930
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,380
Go ahead, Seok Jin.

1931
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,680
Then I'll go.

1932
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,350
- Okay, so...
 - Do you have an idea?

1933
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,580
- You go ahead.
 - What I'm saying is...

1934
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,850
- we need to...
 - I just remembered.

1935
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,880
- We need to...
 - Okay, I got it.

1936
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,750
Are you angry?

1937
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,950
I'm not angry.

1938
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,050
- I understand.
 - Do you?

1939
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,780
I understand. You just thought of something.

1940
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,380
- Go ahead.
 - I thought of something.

1941
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,580
Let's leave it up to chance.

1942
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,250
- Okay.
 - Let's leave it up to luck.

1943
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,580
- Let's go by the rules.
 - Okay.

1944
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,940
- Let's go if we have to.
 - All right.

1945
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,150
(Out of 4, 2 are duds.)

1946
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,380
What would be a good pick?

1947
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,490
Shouldn't there be 2? Why are there 4?

1948
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,250
Gary has to be chosen, correct?

1949
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,490
(Seok Jin chooses.)

1950
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,990
- If we pick eraser, we all win.
 - Right.

1951
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,250
- That's right.
 - Then it'll be over.

1952
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,650
I don't think that's it.

1953
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:46,250
(What...)

1954
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,250
(will it...)

1955
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,940
(be?)

1956
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,650
It's a switch chance.

1957
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,490
He can pick another one.

1958
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,050
- That's right.
 - I'll try.

1959
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,150
- I'll do it.
 - You go ahead.

1960
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:58,380
(Kwang Soo will pick.)

1961
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,380
Why are the unlucky two picking?

1962
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,150
- Jae Seok.
 - Are you lucky?

1963
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:05,490
Let's get the eraser chance this time.

1964
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:06,580
Get the eraser, Jae Seok.

1965
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,750
(Jae Seok will pick.)

1966
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,150
- Okay.
 - Are you the lucky one?

1967
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,250
Guys, go back to your seats.

1968
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,920
(Go back to your seats.)

1969
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,580
- I almost believed you.
 - You're not lucky.

1970
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,250
(Seok Jin, Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are all unlucky.)

1971
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,990
- You aren't lucky.
 - Come on.

1972
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,680
- Gosh.
 - Let's see who's the unlucky one.

1973
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,080
- You don't have much luck, too.
 - Let's see who's the most unlucky.

1974
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,680
(It's all up to Haha.)

1975
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,750
We will all pick one. Those will be the bad ones.

1976
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,850
- One at a time.
 - Okay.

1977
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,580
- You two pick first.
 - Okay.

1978
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,950
I'll make the final choice and open it.

1979
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,250
- All right.
 - We are the unlucky ones.

1980
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,580
- I picked that one.
 - I'll pick the bad one.

1981
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,550
- We'll get rid of the bad ones.
 - Okay.

1982
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:42,930
- This is it.
 - Okay.

1983
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,580
This is the final one, okay?

1984
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,490
- Okay.
 - That's the final choice.

1985
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,580
- What will it be?
 - We need the eraser chance.

1986
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:51,050
The eraser chance shouldn't be on this one.

1987
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,450
(Who has the eraser chance?)

1988
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,880
- Delivery.
 - Look at this.

1989
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,050
- Do you see how unlucky I am?
 - Gosh.

1990
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,880
- What did I tell you?
 - Oh goodness.

1991
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,380
I knew it all along.

1992
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,150
- Look how unlucky I am.
 - Let's do this.

1993
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,350
- We need to deliver it.
 - As long as this isn't eraser.

1994
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,750
- Right.
 - It shouldn't be eraser.

1995
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,360
If you did pick eraser, then you're really unlucky.

1996
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,290
You might as well be the unluckiest person in the world.

1997
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,180
Let's cross our fingers.

1998
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,490
If he picked eraser...

1999
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,750
(Will he be the unluckiest guy alive or become a hero?)

2000
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,050
It can't be.

2001
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,790
(Everything rests on Kwang Soo.)

2002
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:30,790
(Please. Please.)

2003
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,680
- Eraser.
 - It's eraser. Goodness.

2004
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,580
Eraser, really?

2005
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,350
You ruined everything.

2006
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,050
Kwang Soo, you are really unlucky.

2007
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,350
How could you pick the most important one?

2008
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:44,080
You picked the delivery chance,

2009
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,780
and you're telling me I'm unlucky because I picked the eraser?

2010
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,720
This is nothing.

2011
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,490
- You are no different than me.
 - It's just...

2012
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,080
- a step back.
 - In this situation he means.

2013
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,290
- You really have the worst luck.
 - In that situation.

2014
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,180
- I really have bad luck...
 - You're just bad luck.

2015
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,580
but you have the worst luck.

2016
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,080
(Worst luck ever)

2017
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,870
What's this?

2018
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,080
Avatar?

2019
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,450
That allows for a person in Muan,

2020
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:06,380
or you could send a person to Muan and if the person...

2021
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,990
finishes the small octopus of Muan in three hours, you succeed.

2022
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,780
I don't know anyone in Muan.

2023
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,990
- No one in Muan.
 - I don't know anyone in Muan.

2024
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,680
Or you could use the switch chance.

2025
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,750
- So there are two valid options.
 - Since I picked it earlier on?

2026
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,380
Let's use the switch chance.

2027
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,080
We can call someone that lives in Ganghwado Island.

2028
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,780
- Do you know someone?
 - Yes.

2029
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:26,880
You do?

2030
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,450
- I know the owner of a pension.
 - In Ganghwado Island?

2031
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,580
- Really?
 - Yes.

2032
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,750
- Call the person.
 - Okay.

2033
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,880
Call the pension owner.

2034
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,780
Call the pension owner and if the person...

2035
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,180
- Ask about the best restaurant.
 - It will be in Ganghwado Island.

2036
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,080
- Right?
 - He's a pension owner here.

2037
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,180
- All right.
 - Ask him.

2038
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,880
The problem is...

2039
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,070
what if he recommends Ganghwado eel?

2040
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,490
- No way.
 - We need to eat it then.

2041
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:46,580
We need to eat it.

2042
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,880
We need to avoid the penalty.

2043
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,970
That's true.

2044
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,790
I hope he picks up.

2045
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,080
Hello.

2046
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,380
I'm in Ganghwado Island right now.

2047
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,990
(I'm in Ganghwado Island right now.)

2048
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,080
Ganghwado Island?

2049
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,380
Is there any restaurant that you recommend?

2050
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,660
The restaurants are closed at this hour.

2051
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:09,460
- It's all right. We can go quick.
 - Recommend a place for us.

2052
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,160
Anything simple like ramyeon.

2053
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,480
Desert is fine too.

2054
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,880
- A convenience store perhaps?
 - Like sherbet.

2055
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,990
A famous convenience store.

2056
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,280
Something like persimmon or rice punch.

2057
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,050
(We hope you get the idea.)

2058
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,580
I heard that Ganghwado Island...

2059
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,380
- is famous for ice cream.
 - You're right.

2060
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,360
Ginseng ice cream.

2061
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,680
- Byeong Soo.
 - Yes.

2062
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,490
You get the point, right?

2063
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:34,060
(You get the point, right?)

2064
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,880
- Talk quietly.
 - All right.

2065
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,350
- You're our last hope.
 - Really.

2066
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,080
- Ready?
 - Yes.

2067
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,950
Is there a nice place to enjoy something light?

2068
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,650
In 1, 2, 3.

2069
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,720
How about pork cutlet?

2070
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,480
- Pork cutlet.
 - What?

2071
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,490
- He said pork cutlet.
 - Pork cutlet.

2072
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,680
Ask him about the name of the restaurant.

2073
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,290
What's the name of the restaurant?

2074
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,790
It's pork cutlet.

2075
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,180
- Pork cutlet.
 - Then we will go there.

2076
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,580
Is he affiliated with the place?

2077
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,580
It's famous for giving big portions.

2078
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,680
(It's famous for giving big portions.)

2079
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,950
(A bolt from the blue)

2080
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,570
- That can't be.
 - Goodness.

2081
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,980
- My goodness.
 - All right, Byeong Soo.

2082
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,970
I'm so full.

2083
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,380
- I don't think I can eat any more.
 - I thought this was the last place.

2084
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,490
Me too.

2085
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,950
- At least...
 - What are we going to do?

2086
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,280
How are we going to finish it?

2087
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,580
- I'm so full.
 - Same here.

2088
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:24,380
We should have picked the exemption option.

2089
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,050
How could Kwang Soo pick that?

2090
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,980
If we picked the exemption option, we would be done already.

2091
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,580
Then we can go home.

2092
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,980
Kwang Soo, why did you do that?

2093
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,380
Take a good look at yourself.

2094
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,880
There must be something left.

2095
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,350
- What was the last one?
 - The last one...

2096
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,790
It's Gary.

2097
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,380
Can you see this?

2098
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,070
- Did you get matching rings?
 - What is that?

2099
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,580
It's symbolic of our bond.

2100
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,080
Bond?

2101
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,380
Goodness.

2102
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,680
- The bond between you and I
 - The bond between you and I

2103
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,080
- Where are you headed?
 - What happened?

2104
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,980
- We need to go eat pork cutlet.
 - We're going to another place.

2105
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,180
We thought that it was our last place, so we ate so much.

2106
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,780
Gary, get waxed or...

2107
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,520
Ji Hyo collect some insects from Jejudo Island.

2108
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,790
I'm getting annoyed.

2109
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,080
- Stop it.
 - Okay.

2110
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,550
Don't push it.

2111
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,480
(She has a quick temper.)

2112
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,880
We came all the way to Jejudo Island to eat kimchi stew,

2113
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,350
so please don't do that.

2114
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,490
We'll succeed.

2115
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:20,080
Complete the mission, all right?

2116
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,780
- Okay.
 - Have a safe trip back.

2117
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,490
We're going to go catch the plane now.

2118
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,980
- Okay.
 - It's snowing a lot here.

2119
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,580
Really? Then the plane might be cancelled.

2120
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,990
Let's go already.

2121
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:32,880
- All right. See you later.
 - See you.

2122
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,180
(Gary and Ji Hyo succeed the mission in Jejudo Island.)

2123
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,880
- The plane won't get cancelled.
 - It could.

2124
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,450
- It might be.
 - Let's go.

2125
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:41,080
- We don't have time.
 - Why?

2126
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:48,480
(Jae Seok's team are on their way to Gimpo.)

2127
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,530
Oh my goodness.

2128
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,290
Thinking of eating pork cutlet is driving me nuts.

2129
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,980
There might be an easy way out.

2130
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,580
How about getting a kid's meal or something?

2131
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,080
- All right.
 - It's for you.

2132
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,750
- Is there a kid's meal?
 - Yes.

2133
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,180
Then let's order that.

2134
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,580
But only children are allowed to order that.

2135
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,990
I'll play the child.

2136
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,350
- I can pretend to be one too.
 - Same here.

2137
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,350
You have to act cute.

2138
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,950
- We need to eat this.
 - We need to.

2139
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,650
We need to clear the mission.

2140
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,990
But I really can't eat pork cutlet.

2141
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,490
- Pork cutlet.
 - How could he say pork cutlet?

2142
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:21,580
We ate a bunch of food that doesn't go well with pork cutlet.

2143
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,180
- Spicy seafood stew is way better.
 - You're right.

2144
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,780
- Because it's spicy.
 - And we had pork cutlet already.

2145
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,580
Since we had eel, which pairs well with spicy seafood stew.

2146
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,880
Does the place open until late at night?

2147
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
(Will it be open?)

2148
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,990
- What if it's closed?
 - What if it is?

2149
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:36,350
- If it's closed, we fail.
 - We fail.

2150
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,490
We receive a penalty.

2151
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:39,080
Goodness.

2152
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
(I've got a bad feeling about this.)

2153
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,380
I'm really full.

2154
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,780
We're eating nonstop today.

2155
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:47,180
- I've never eaten this much before.
 - Me neither.

2156
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,880
I thought about it before.

2157
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,380
We're nearly there. We have 400m left.

2158
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,080
I think so. They looked like they wanted to.

2159
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,080
- Do we need to go further?
 - It says 160m.

2160
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,790
- We're in trouble.
 - It's over there.

2161
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,580
It looks like it gives big portions.

2162
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,180
It's closed.

2163
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,750
- It's closed?
 - It's closed.

2164
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,480
- It's closed?
 - It's closed. Oh, no.

2165
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,850
- Really?
 - Oh, this...

2166
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,290
- It's closed.
 - It's closed.

2167
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:11,780
- It's closed.
 - It's closed anyways.

2168
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,380
- What are we to do?
 - What should we do?

2169
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,680
It's really closed.

2170
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,990
It's their day off.

2171
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,680
- Why?
 - It is?

2172
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,780
Why?

2173
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,880
They're closed on Mondays.

2174
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,080
What are we to do?

2175
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,680
- This isn't good.
 - Is this the place?

2176
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:26,380
- It's usually open.
 - What are we to do?

2177
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,580
- We're in trouble.
 - How much time do we have left?

2178
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,980
- How can it be closed?
 - Excuse me.

2179
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,280
They're closed on Mondays.

2180
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,990
What are we going to do?

2181
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:34,280
What should we do?

2182
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,490
Did we fail then?

2183
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,680
(Oh, my goodness)

2184
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,180
What are we going to do?

2185
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,380
Did we fail then?

2186
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,380
- There's two hours left.
 - Let's call another person.

2187
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,580
- Again.
 - That person...

2188
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,080
- That person...
 - Do you have anyone you know?

2189
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,080
- Call someone you know.
 - We can tell them, right?

2190
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,380
We need to know the time.

2191
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,580
Let's go.

2192
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,380
I never could have guessed it was their day off.

2193
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,980
It is.

2194
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,580
If it's their day off...

2195
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,880
- How could this be?
 - Call another person.

2196
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,490
- Try again, somewhere close.
 - Try again.

2197
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,880
Someone that lives in Gimpo.

2198
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,380
- Shin Young.
 - Call her.

2199
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,850
- She lives in Gimpo?
 - Shin Young lives in Gimpo.

2200
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:12,480
She might be in a shoot.

2201
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:16,580
(Pick up, resident of Gimpo.)

2202
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,850
She wouldn't...

2203
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:21,080
- Hello.
 - Shin Young.

2204
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,380
Hey!

2205
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,880
- Shin Young.
 - Yes.

2206
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,750
We're in Gimpo.

2207
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,990
You're in Gimpo?

2208
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,080
- Yes.
 - Yes, Gimpo.

2209
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,850
- We...
 - We don't have time.

2210
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:36,060
We don't have much time. Could you recommend a simple dish?

2211
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,380
Snail rice porridge.

2212
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,880
- Snail rice porridge.
 - Snail rice porridge.

2213
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,180
(Snail rice porridge)

2214
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,280
Shin Young, where is that place?

2215
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,490
- It's better than pork cutlet.
 - What?

2216
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:45,680
- What?
 - What?

2217
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,950
The cheonggukjang is handmade at the place...

2218
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,990
- and they serve Korean snails.
 - Really?

2219
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,880
- The address.
 - What's the address?

2220
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,880
- We need to go there.
 - Is it...

2221
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,680
the snail rice porridge place?

2222
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,680
- Yes.
 - Snail?

2223
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,470
- We found it.
 - In Gimpo.

2224
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,990
In Gimpo.

2225
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,180
Gimpo Han River new town.

2226
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,850
- Okay.
 - All right.

2227
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,350
- Shin Young, thank you.
 - Thank you.

2228
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,490
- It's over here.
 - Is it Running Man?

2229
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,580
Yes, it's Running Man.

2230
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,680
Hello everyone.

2231
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,990
(I'm Hong Geum Bo.)

2232
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,980
- Hong Jin Pao.
 - Hong Jin Pao.

2233
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,490
- Thanks, Shin Young.
 - You're welcome.

2234
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,880
Wait a minute.

2235
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,080
Let's go over there.

2236
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,280
That's a relief.

2237
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,180
- Thanks to Shin Young.
 - In Gyeonggi province, Gimpo,

2238
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,380
- Ojang-dong.
 - Is it still open?

2239
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,880
It's a relief.

2240
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,380
- Really.
 - Let's go.

2241
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,490
I thought it was over.

2242
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,490
There's not much time left.

2243
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:34,990
How much time does it take?

2244
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,350
It's 14km away.

2245
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,780
- It's quite far away.
 - Let's hurry.

2246
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,080
It takes 40 minutes.

2247
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,380
- 40 minutes?
 - Yes.

2248
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,350
But it's a relief.

2249
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,880
Thanks to Shin Young.

2250
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,880
Is it this way?

2251
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,850
(One team is in Gimpo, while the other team is at Jeju Airport.)

2252
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,380
- We could fail.
 - Indeed.

2253
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,080
(At 9:15pm, they arrive near the snail rice porridge place.)

2254
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,180
Wait, we're here.

2255
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,580
Wait, go a little further.

2256
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,180
It looks dark though.

2257
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,580
- It's ominous.
 - There's only 100m left.

2258
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,350
Wait, what is this?

2259
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,780
It can't be.

2260
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,960
It's here.

2261
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,780
It can't be.

2262
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,750
(It can't possibly be closed again.)

2263
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,580
- What if it's closed?
 - It can't be.

2264
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,990
- It's closed.
 - What?

2265
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:25,080
- It's closed.
 - Really?

2266
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,880
- It's closed?
 - I can't believe this.

2267
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,480
- It's closed.
 - Really?

2268
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,150
- It's closed?
 - This can't be.

2269
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,490
- This one is closed too?
 - Really?

2270
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,080
- Is it closed?
 - Unbelievable.

2271
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,380
This place is also closed?

2272
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,280
- It's closed.
 - We don't have time.

2273
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,350
- It's only 9pm.
 - Hey.

2274
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,180
- It's closed.
 - What?

2275
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,780
- It's closed.
 - Really? It's closed?

2276
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,980
This can't be.

2277
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,880
- This one is closed too?
 - Yes, it is.

2278
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,280
We don't have time.

2279
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,180
- It's only 9pm.
 - Hey.

2280
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,680
Let's call Shin Young again.

2281
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,990
- We have an hour left...
 - What's this?

2282
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:57,280
We have an hour.

2283
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,780
- This one is closed too?
 - It's driving me mad.

2284
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,990
What is this?

2285
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,380
I need to call Shin Young again.

2286
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,280
You got to be kidding me.

2287
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,860
Just tell her that we're on the way to her house.

2288
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,080
We should go to her house instead.

2289
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,180
Since this is Gimpo,

2290
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,080
- there should be another place.
 - Shin Young should know.

2291
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,320
- We don't have much time left.
 - Hey.

2292
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,850
We'll have to ask Shin Young again.

2293
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,490
- Shin Young.
 - Yes.

2294
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,950
Unfortunately, the restaurant is closed.

2295
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,650
- Oh, no.
 - Nine minutes has passed.

2296
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,850
Shin Young,

2297
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,150
- would there be any place open?
 - We don't have much time left.

2298
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:28,250
- In Janggi-dong,
 - Yes.

2299
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,950
- there's a dumpling restaurant.
 - Dumpling?

2300
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,250
- A dumpling restaurant?
 - Yes.

2301
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,020
- They serve dumplings.
 - Would they be open?

2302
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,490
I guess.

2303
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:36,350
What's the name of the restaurant?

2304
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,850
Sam Dumplings.

2305
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,250
Sam Dumplings?

2306
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,250
They serve handmade dumplings.

2307
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,250
- I found it.
 - We found it.

2308
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,350
Shin Young.

2309
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,250
- Thank you.
 - Sam...

2310
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,750
- Handmade Dumplings.
 - Thank you.

2311
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,150
- Thank you.
 - If things don't turn out well,

2312
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:52,250
we might go to your place.

2313
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,260
(She laughs hysterically.)

2314
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,850
- Janggi-dong.
 - All right.

2315
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,050
Thank you.

2316
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:01,170
- Good luck.
 - Thank you.

2317
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,850
- Thank you.
 - I think they'll be open.

2318
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,950
- It's located over there.
 - We have to move again.

2319
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,750
- Gosh.
 - What are we doing?

2320
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,650
How much time do we have left?

2321
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,850
Every restaurant is closed.

2322
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:12,950
I can't believe this.

2323
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,250
- It's 3.2km away.
 - It's quite close.

2324
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,950
- Let's hurry.
 - We don't have a lot of time.

2325
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,120
(The dumpling restaurant is 3.2km away.)

2326
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,220
It'll only take 10 minutes to get there.

2327
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,050
And dumplings can be served right away.

2328
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,490
That's right.

2329
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,850
Dumplings are easy to eat as well.

2330
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,220
We can have just one each.

2331
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,580
Gosh.

2332
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,880
(At 9:25pm, they are heading to the dumpling restaurant.)

2333
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:33,040
- It should be around here.
 - It should be here.

2334
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,820
Where is it?

2335
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,250
- Please.
 - We don't have a lot of time.

2336
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,490
I see a sign that has dumplings.

2337
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:39,850
- There?
 - It says dumplings.

2338
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,480
- It's here.
 - They're open!

2339
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,750
- They're open!
 - They're open!

2340
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,850
We got this.

2341
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:47,850
- Is it here?
 - They're open.

2342
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,580
- Let's go.
 - They won't close.

2343
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,150
- Is it really here?
 - Let's go.

2344
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:52,380
Is it here?

2345
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,250
- Is it here?
 - It's here.

2346
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,050
I don't think it's here.

2347
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,250
Wait.

2348
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,380
It's not here.

2349
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,850
- What was the name again?
 - Sam something.

2350
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,380
It's not here.

2351
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,350
It's that one over there.

2352
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,150
- Are they closed?
 - It's here.

2353
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,850
Wait.

2354
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,320
- Are they closed?
 - Call and ask her again.

2355
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,640
(No way!)

2356
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,350
She said they open until late.

2357
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,680
- It's closed?
 - It looks like it.

2358
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,450
It's here.

2359
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,550
It was this place.

2360
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:24,150
Gosh.

2361
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:26,950
What's going on? Is this some kind of prank?

2362
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,220
Is it a prank?

2363
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,150
- Is Shin Young a spy?
 - She said they were open.

2364
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,110
All of them are closed.

2365
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,490
From the pork cutlet place.

2366
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:36,350
- I can't believe this.
 - It's closed.

2367
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,250
- It's dark.
 - It's over.

2368
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,750
- Really? Is it closed?
 - I can't believe this.

2369
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,580
- This place is also closed?
 - Yes, it is.

2370
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,250
We don't have enough time.

2371
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,950
It's only 9pm. Why are they closed?

2372
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,460
We should hurry up.

2373
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,950
Ask her again.

2374
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,380
Let's find a place within walking distance.

2375
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,850
- Hello?
 - Shin Young.

2376
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,220
- They're closed again.
 - What are you thinking?

2377
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,280
- Shin Young, sorry.
 - You...

2378
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,030
Don't be like that. Shin Young.

2379
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,350
They're closed again.

2380
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,350
Shin Young, we see a hamburger restaurant.

2381
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,550
- Shin Young.
 - Let us go there.

2382
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,850
- Shin Young.
 - Jae Seok.

2383
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,950
- Yes.
 - I'll hang up.

2384
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:11,680
- Shin Young.
 - Please don't.

2385
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,250
- Please don't.
 - Don't hang up.

2386
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,950
- Let's do this.
 - Please tell us where to go.

2387
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,150
- Shin Young.
 - Within walking distance.

2388
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,950
A castella place.

2389
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:21,580
- Great!
 - Nice!

2390
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,680
(That sounds nice!)

2391
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,750
There's a castella place.

2392
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,950
Okay.

2393
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:27,050
- Would they be open?
 - I'm sure they're open.

2394
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:29,490
- Okay.
 - They have to pay a high rent.

2395
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:32,150
To make ends meet,

2396
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,250
they have to close late.

2397
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,750
- I found it.
 - We found it, Shin Young.

2398
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,540
We found it. Thank you, Shin Young.

2399
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,380
- Let's hurry.
 - Thank you, Shin Young.

2400
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,680
(They're headed to a bakery now.)

2401
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,050
- Let's go.
 - Let's hurry.

2402
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:45,850
We're running out of time.

2403
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:48,120
- Where's our car?
 - Seok Jin.

2404
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,490
- How can we get there?
 - Go straight.

2405
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:51,950
(At 9:35pm, they are heading to a bakery.)

2406
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:54,220
How can this be possible? Every restaurant is closed.

2407
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,120
It's only 9:30pm.

2408
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,480
What are we doing?

2409
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,850
- Gosh.
 - Seriously.

2410
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,950
- We have to succeed.
 - I'm determined.

2411
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,580
I'm determined this time.

2412
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,950
We thought we had enough time.

2413
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,150
We wasted so much time.

2414
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,350
- I think it's around here.
 - We're almost there.

2415
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,250
- Go straight.
 - It must be on this street.

2416
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,750
- I think it's on the left side.
 - It's there.

2417
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,490
- We're here!
 - We made it!

2418
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:19,350
We're here. It's open!

2419
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,680
(If they're open, they'll easily complete their mission.)

2420
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,740
- It's open!
 - We're here.

2421
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,250
- It's dark inside.
 - They're closed.

2422
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,750
- They're closed.
 - Really?

2423
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:29,150
This is impossible.

2424
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:31,320
- Are they closed, too?
 - Yes, they are.

2425
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,050
- Really?
 - Yes.

2426
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:34,290
Really?

2427
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:35,580
- They're closed.
 - This is crazy.

2428
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,950
She said there's another place across the street.

2429
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,680
- She said something.
 - Are they really closed?

2430
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,580
- Yes.
 - How can this be possible?

2431
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,140
This is unbelievable.

2432
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,680
- Are they really closed?
 - They are.

2433
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,580
- She said they were open.
 - I'm going crazy.

2434
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,380
- I can't believe this.
 - Gosh.

2435
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,150
Nothing's working out.

2436
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,580
Are they really closed?

2437
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,220
Or why don't we ask Shin Young...

2438
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,580
to search for a place near here?

2439
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,750
- A dessert shop or something.
 - This is unbelievable.

2440
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,150
Shin Young must be stressed too.

2441
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,250
There's something here.

2442
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,850
- Hello?
 - Shin Young.

2443
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,950
- It's closed.
 - Shin Young, they're closed, too.

2444
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:12,320
- We're running out of time.
 - Then try this place.

2445
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,580
Which one?

2446
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,750
Which building?

2447
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,320
It's across the street.

2448
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,680
Across the street?

2449
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,950
It's over there.

2450
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:22,380
Okay. On the first floor?

2451
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:25,520
Okay. Shin Young,

2452
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,350
- you sound tired.
 - Her voice is very low.

2453
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,490
(Shin Young is getting tired of helping them.)

2454
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:32,580
Shin Young, we're sorry. We'll make sure to find the place.

2455
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,380
- Thank you.
 - Let's run.

2456
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,950
It must be over there.

2457
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:37,940
I'll find it.

2458
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,150
(We're in a hurry!)

2459
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,250
Excuse me.

2460
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,750
It's around here.

2461
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,880
(They have to run now.)

2462
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:52,550
Did you find it?

2463
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:57,050
- Did you find it?
 - Run, hurry.

2464
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:59,290
I'll find it.

2465
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,350
- They're closed.
 - Not again.

2466
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:02,490
Really? Are they closed?

2467
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,580
I can't believe this.

2468
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,490
- This place is closed as well?
 - Is it closed?

2469
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,450
We don't have enough time.

2470
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:12,290
Our flight would have been cancelled if we had gotten here a bit earlier.

2471
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,790
What?

2472
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,350
I think they failed.

2473
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:20,020
I have a feeling.

2474
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,120
I'm getting stressed.

2475
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,110
(Will we be penalised?)

2476
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:26,790
- It's snowing here too.
 - It's snowing.

2477
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,550
I'm already worried about the penalty.

2478
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:33,050
I have a feeling they failed.

2479
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,880
(What will be waiting for Gary and Ji Hyo?)

2480
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:39,150
I think they failed.

2481
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,450
They're coming.

2482
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:47,350
(Through the snow storm,)

2483
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:51,550
(they're finally back.)

2484
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,020
Gary.

2485
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,350
- Good job.
 - If it had started snowing earlier,

2486
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,680
the flight would have been cancelled.

2487
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
- Really?
 - Yes.

2488
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,490
The flight could have been cancelled.

2489
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,290
We barely made it.

2490
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:07,580
(By the way...)

2491
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:10,290
I get the feeling they failed.

2492
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,990
(Will they have a happy ending?)

2493
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,790
I hope we didn't come all the way here to get penalised.

2494
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:19,150
(What will be awaiting them?)

2495
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,730
(By the way...)

2496
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:40,440
I get the feeling they failed.

2497
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,140
(Will they have a happy ending?)

2498
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,940
I hope we didn't come all the way here to get penalised.

2499
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:49,300
(What will be awaiting them?)

2500
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,930
Run. It's this way.

2501
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,100
I'll find it.

2502
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,230
- It's this way.
 - Let's go.

2503
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,500
(We have to make it this time.)

2504
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:05,230
Have you found it?

2505
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:11,400
(Will they succeed this time?)

2506
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,730
- It's here!
 - We found it!

2507
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:16,000
- We found it!
 - It's here.

2508
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,600
They're open. They're closing up.

2509
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,630
They're closing up.

2510
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,600
(Did they really find it?)

2511
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,900
Did you find it?

2512
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,830
Oh, it's here.

2513
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,980
Are you guys still open?

2514
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,900
You're closing up? But you're still technically open, right?

2515
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,400
When do you close?

2516
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,400
- We close at 10pm.
 - Thank you.

2517
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,600
- We don't have much time.
 - We have 13 minutes left.

2518
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,100
We nearly failed.

2519
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,900
Thank you.

2520
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:43,930
(They're celebrating the success with cakes.)

2521
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:45,470
(The taste of success)

2522
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,900
I feel great.

2523
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,600
Thank you.

2524
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,730
This tastes great.

2525
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,970
- Shin Young, thank you.
 - It's kind of...

2526
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:53,900
- Cheers.
 - Cheers.

2527
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,500
- All right.
 - Good job.

2528
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,600
Good job.

2529
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,700
Great job.

2530
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,000
We almost failed.

2531
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,890
If this place was closed...

2532
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:04,570
and Shin Young didn't answer the phone...

2533
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:05,730
(61 minutes until the deadline)

2534
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,370
This is delicious.

2535
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,830
(The food race is over.)

2536
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:10,370
I can see why she recommended this place.

2537
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:11,700
I agree.

2538
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:18,830
(Mission completed)

2539
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:20,730
You completed the mission.

2540
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,100
Really?

2541
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,200
(The prize is handed.)

2542
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,000
- Wow, look at that.
 - We made it.

2543
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,400
- Wow.
 - Look.

2544
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,200
Are they made of gold?

2545
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,300
Look at the colour of it.

2546
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,370
This is a golden spoon.

2547
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:34,430
If we carry this around and eat with it,

2548
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:36,200
- it'll look amazing.
 - That'd be cool.

2549
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,000
- It'll look fantastic.
 - This looks amazing.

2550
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,400
- Good job.
 - Good job.

2551
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,630
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

2552
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:42,570
We made it!

2554
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,470
(But...)

2555
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:49,600

2560
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,900
This will be amazing.

2561
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,300
Can I do whatever I want?

(Mission Impossible in Dubai)

2563
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:13,370
- I don't think I can do it.
 - Oh my gosh!

(They will adventure into the desert.)

2569
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,130
Let's go.

2570
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,630
It's a real desert.

2571
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,030
It's endless.

2572
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,530
This is Dubai.

(The extreme mission race will be held in the real desert.)

2574
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:33,370
It's dangerous!

2575
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,470
Will we sleep here?

2576
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,630
