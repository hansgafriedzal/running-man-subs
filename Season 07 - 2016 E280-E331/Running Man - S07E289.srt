1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,580
This is Dubai.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,780
Wow.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,920
It's so pretty.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,580
This place is amazing.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,680
This is why people talk highly of Dubai.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,650
I never thought Running Man would let us relax like this.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,680
I love that we are allowed to freely travel around here.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,480
Ji Hyo! I'm loving this!

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,850
Don't you love being here?

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,950
- This is tasty.
 - I was surprised.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,680
(Running Man members have fallen in love with Dubai.)

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,270
This is freedom.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,390
(However,)

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,750
(their freedom was short-lived and the extreme mission race unfolds.)

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,890
This is really dangerous!

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,280
It's a real desert. Oh, my.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,550
(There will be no freedom. Those who fail will receive a penalty.)

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,780
- This is nonsense.
 - This is too much.

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,780
(What will happen in Dubai?)

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,150
(Running Man in Dubai)

21
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,080
(Incheon International Airport, late at night)

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,480
(Running Man tour?)

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,720
- Hello.
 - Hello.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,150
It's a nice evening.

25
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,720
(Welcome to Running Man Tour, individual travelling in Dubai)

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,550
Individual travelling is valid only when there is no camera.

27
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,650
Are we really going to be freely travelling?

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,590
Yes. Everyone, welcome to our individual travelling in Dubai.

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,380
(Please believe us. It'll be a treat.)

30
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,590
- Really?
 - I love Dubai!

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,280
- Is this real?
 - Since you have worked so hard,

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,380
we have planned a special vacation to Dubai.

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,480
- Really?
 - Are we really freely travelling?

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,380
Don't make us angry from the beginning.

35
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,350
- I think it will be a tough trip.
 - It'll be a wonderful trip.

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,680
(At that moment)

37
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,150
(Is he a tourist guide or a guest?)

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,120
- It's a man.
 - It's a man.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,550
- Why is it a man?
 - That gait looks familiar.

40
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,580
- Who is it?
 - I've seen those legs a lot.

41
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,850
- Who is it?
 - Who?

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,680
- It must be Yong Hwa.
 - It's not him.

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,020
- Is it not Yong Hwa?
 - Who is it?

44
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,480
He looks like he has come out here before.

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,050
- Yes, he must've been here before.
 - You're right.

46
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,280
- Isn't it Ji Sung?
 - Yes, he must've been here before.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
(Who could this man be?)

48
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,750
I'm here.

49
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,120
(Jung Il Woo.)

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
- Jung Il Woo.
 - Jung Il Woo.

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,180
Why are you going that way?

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,480
(He was remembered as the quick and competitive.)

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
(He swings...)

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
(and misses.)

55
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,880
(What has happened to Il Woo?)

56
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,280
- It's Il Woo.
 - Il Woo.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,290
- Hello.
 - I was about to say his name.

58
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,280
His legs look unique.

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,580
I knew it was him from the beginning.

60
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,150
His legs look like that of a runner's.

61
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,490
It's Il Woo.

62
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,750
Il Woo, have you been to Dubai before?

63
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,280
- He has a strong desire to win.
 - No, it's my first time.

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,380
- Is it your first time to Dubai?
 - Yes.

65
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,480
- Really?
 - Yes.

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,580
(Another person approaches the members.)

67
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,480
It's sea anemone hairstyle.

68
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
There's another person coming.

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,950
(What?)

70
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,170
(Shy)

71
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,180
Da Hey, don't hide your face.

72
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,280
We know it's you.

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,490
It's Da Hey.

74
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,880
(Goodness!)

75
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,790
- Hello, Da Hey.
 - We know.

76
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,280
It's really Lee Da Hey.

77
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,180
It's been a while.

78
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,280
(She was very active on Running Man and even eliminated the spy.)

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,350
Let's get rid of him quickly.

80
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,350
I need to do at least something since I'm on this show.

81
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
- Hello.
 - Hello.

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
- Hello.
 - You look great.

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,380
- Thank you.
 - You're right.

84
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,850
Isn't Da Hey older than Il Woo?

85
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,280
- Yes, I'm older.
 - Yes.

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,580
These days, it's common to see older women with younger men.

87
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,180
It's been 13 years since I've known Da Hey.

88
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,850
- Really?
 - That's a long time.

89
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,950
Il Woo visited the broadcasting station 13 years ago.

90
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,380
I had a dream of becoming an actor.

91
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,780
- Oh, it was before you debuted.
 - He had a short haircut.

92
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,080
- I was really nervous.
 - Was it during your army service?

93
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
I bought him...

94
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,150
- jjajangmyeon and jjambbong.
 - Really?

95
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,280
- Oh, really?
 - Yes.

96
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,780
Let's get going since we have all arrived.

97
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm still not sure if we'll be able to freely travel.

98
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,850
Are they really going to give it up that easily?

99
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,380
- There's no way they would.
 - It can't be possible.

100
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,480
It can't be.

101
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,380
(Whether you believe it or not,)

102
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,880
(aren't you excited to depart?)

103
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,480
I heard that in Dubai, people sell gold on the streets.

104
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,580
- Really?
 - There are even vending machines.

105
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,850
- Yes.
 - Let's buy some.

106
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,220
(Really?)

107
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,450
The fact that they gave us this is unsettling.

108
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,020
I feel like I need to memorise it.

109
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,480
Or maybe we'll have to go to certain locations in this book...

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,250
and carry out a mission.

111
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,780
This worries me. I'm so nervous.

112
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,380
Let's get on board.

113
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,930
Let's go.

114
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,450
(See you later.)

115
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,150
- Goodbye.
 - Thank you.

116
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,800
(See you later.)

117
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,180
One, two, three.

118
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,780
(Their flight to Dubai took 10 hours and 10 minutes.)

119
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,180
(After 10 hours in the air,)

120
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,780
(they have arrived in Dubai.)

121
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,680
Oh my gosh!

122
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,320
(Despite it being dawn, many fans came to greet the members.)

123
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,850
(Dear Dubai fans, it's nice to meet you all.)

124
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,280
(It's the Prince of Asia.)

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,780
- Lee Kwang Soo!
 - Lee Kwang Soo!

126
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,350
Kwang Soo is very popular.

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,880
(Has Kwang Soo won over Dubai, too?)

128
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,590
(Shy)

129
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,580
(Thank you, fans of Running Man!)

130
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,180
This show is really popular.

131
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,480
Hi.

132
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
- Goodbye.
 - Goodbye.

133
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,880
You're like idol stars.

134
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,380
- In Arabic...
 - What time is it?

135
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,650
I think it's about 5am here.

136
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,880
- It's 6am.
 - It's 6:13am.

137
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,290
- Is it already morning?
 - It must be around 11am in Korea.

138
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,480
- Yes.
 - Do you mean it's eleven o'clock...

139
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,650
in the morning?

140
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,880
- It's very clean and...
 - It's neat.

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,530
very detailed.

142
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,180
That building is so tall.

143
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,700
Which one?

144
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,180
- That's the one!
 - It's that one!

145
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,120
- It's that one.
 - "Mission: Impossible".

146
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,180
- I can't even see the top.
 - Oh, my.

147
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,580
I can't see the very top!

148
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,180
- It's Burj Khalifa.
 - I saw it in the book.

149
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,280
Where is it?

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
- Over there.
 - It was in "Mission: Impossible".

151
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Over there. It's Burj Khalifa.

152
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
I can't see.

153
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
- That's amazing.
 - Take a picture, Kwang Soo.

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,180
- Wait.
 - My goodness.

155
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,280
- I can't see the top.
 - So that's the one.

156
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,880
That has 203 floors, right?

157
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,280
- Wow!
 - Gosh, that's amazing!

158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,910
It's so tall.

159
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,530
It's a real skyscraper.

160
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,780
I can't see.

161
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,080
You need to duck a little to see it.

162
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,180
- This is...
 - It's over here.

163
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,680
just amazing.

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,380
(Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest building with a height of 829.8m.)

165
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,380
- I really can't see it.
 - I bet...

166
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,180
I bet you could see that when you're riding a helicopter.

167
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,550
It's amazing.

168
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,020
It's really tall.

169
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,880
- Really?
 - It's so amazing.

170
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,180
How tall is it?

171
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,380
Gosh, that's really tall.

172
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,050
- Where?
 - Look at that.

173
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,080
We must be going over there.

174
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,380
That's what I was told.

175
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,650
- Goodness.
 - Really?

176
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,850
Have we arrived?

177
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,080
(He is deeply moved.)

178
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,550
- This is where...
 - Oh, my.

179
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,180
Tom Cruise ran.

180
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,580
- This place?
 - Tom Cruise.

181
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,980
- Tom Cruise.
 - From "Mission: Impossible".

182
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,270
- It looks really splendid.
 - It's that place.

183
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,880
It's that scene where he climbed up wearing the gloves.

184
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,250
Are we going up?

185
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,080
Can we go?

186
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,580
The people living up there should have their parachutes ready.

187
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,580
(They enter the building to get in the lift.)

188
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,580
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes?

189
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,220
What are you going to press?

190
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,980
There are only two buttons, ground floor and 124th floor.

191
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,180
(There are only two buttons, for the ground and 124th floor.)

192
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,480
It's right here.

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,180
It goes directly up.

194
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,320
- Are we going up now?
 - Yes.

195
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,620
What is this?

196
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,880
The music is nice.

197
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,980
We're on the seventh floor.

198
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,280
Are we going up?

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,380
It's going so fast.

200
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,480
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

201
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,080
- My ears feel funny.
 - 20, 21, 22...

202
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,450
- Me too.
 - Really.

203
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,680
We're on the 27th floor. My ears feels funny.

204
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,250
- Hold your breath.
 - It's so fast.

205
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,380
- Goodness.
 - My ears feel funny.

206
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,550
(It takes only a minute to reach the 124th floor.)

207
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,780
I swallowed eight times.

208
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,020
- It's scary.
 - There's no...

209
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,120
We're on the 55th floor.

210
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,380
- We're on the 58th floor.
 - It's going faster.

211
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,780
It's nearly...

212
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,950
We're almost on the 80th floor.

213
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,480
We're already so high up.

214
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,060
This is terrifying.

215
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,280
My heart is thumping so hard.

216
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
Wow, we're already here.

217
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,870
- The music is quite...
 - It's the world's tallest building.

218
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,650
- Oh, my.
 - We're here. It's like a scene...

219
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,920
from the movies.

220
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,180
I thought I was on a ride.

221
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,280
(Amazed)

222
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,380
This is amazing.

223
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,120
(In just 1 minute,)

224
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,080
(they arrived in a whole new world.)

225
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,580
- This is amazing.
 - It's amazing.

226
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,480
(Are you ready for this?)

227
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,280
- It's scary.
 - We're really high up.

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,580
(The sun rises above the horizon.)

229
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,870
It's so high.

230
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,180
This is unbelievable.

231
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,480
(They can look over skyscrapers.)

232
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,080
This is a scene from "Mission: Impossible".

233
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,450
(This is unbelievable.)

234
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,020
- It's scary.
 - It's so high up.

235
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,450
I can't believe this.

236
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,630
It's so high.

237
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,050
This is unbelievable.

238
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,750
(They are at a loss for words.)

239
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,780
When shooting "Mission: Impossible",

240
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,680
Tom Cruise came here, right?

241
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,950
I got goosebumps.

242
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,180
It's too tall.

243
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,650
I'm getting tingling feelings.

244
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,120
- This is amazing.
 - Over here. I can't get any closer.

245
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,390
(The splendid view of the skyline is revealed.)

246
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,580
Why are you trying to show me?

247
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,920
You came a long way.

248
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,980
- Yes.
 - Yes.

249
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,280
As you have all heard before we departed Korea,

250
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,480
you will be travelling freely.

251
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,150
You can explore Dubai freely.

252
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,320
Really?

253
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,850
- No way.
 - I don't believe it.

254
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,980
(There has to be something more.)

255
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,320
We'll hand out the itinerary first.

256
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,580
- Really?
 - Yes.

257
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,050
This can't be true.

258
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,280
- This can't be.
 - Can we go anywhere we want?

259
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,550
- Can we go clubbing at night?
 - They have name tags on them.

260
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,950
- "Jung Il Woo".
 - I should put it in here.

261
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,120
Yes, in the front.

262
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,850
You have the itinerary in your bag.

263
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,950
What is this?

264
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,050
What are these mysterious blanks?

265
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,950
- All right.
 - We're supposed to fill them.

266
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,480
- So this is our itinerary.
 - Starting from...

267
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,550
the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa,

268
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,280
you'll visit tourist attractions in Dubai...

269
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,780
- described in the itinerary.
 - Okay.

270
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,050
- You can choose where to go.
 - Can we go anywhere?

271
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,220
Yes, enjoy the places as much as you want.

272
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,320
- Look at this! What is this?
 - Enjoy some food as well.

273
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
- There's ziplining!
 - In your bag...

274
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,280
- Look at this.
 - We can choose not to go.

275
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,540
You can choose not to go.

276
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,680
Who did you think would attempt skydiving?

277
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
- When you arrive...
 - Is there skydiving as well?

278
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,120
- There is.
 - Yes.

279
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,650
After completing your mission, you can move to another place.

280
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,020
Just go anywhere you want.

281
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,120
Have some fun and try out the mission.

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
- That's all you need to do.
 - Really?

283
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,580
- There's a beach.
 - When you're there...

284
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,950
So we don't have to go skydiving, right?

285
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,120
- Of course not.
 - Really?

286
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,220
Next to each place in the itinerary, you'll see a star.

287
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,450
The stars indicate how hard the mission will be.

288
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,050
When you complete each mission,

289
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,050
you'll get a grasshopper stamp...

290
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,390
as Dubai means "Grasshopper" in their old language.

291
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,480
- Really?
 - It means "Grasshopper".

292
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,850
- Dubai!
 - This is...

293
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,280
my second home.

294
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,550
This is your city.

295
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,150
(Welcome to the land of grasshoppers.)

296
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,480
So... Until the desert tour starts...

297
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,750
- It starts at 3pm.
 - If you get 10 stamps...

298
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,220
- Gosh.
 - 10 stamps?

299
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,780
You'll get to stay at a luxurious resort.

300
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,180
- Wow.
 - Really?

301
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,420
- The thing is,
 - Without the staff?

302
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,750
the resort is in the middle of the desert.

303
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,580
- Out of the nine of you,
 - Yes.

304
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,550
only five will get to stay there.

305
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,850
(Then what about the remaining 4?)

306
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,650
The others will bivouac in the desert.

307
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,220
(4 people with the least stamps will bivouac.)

308
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,720
(Sleeping in the desert?)

309
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,750
(Which unlucky 4 will end up spending the night in the desert?)

310
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,950
(Welcome to the desert.)

311
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,580
You'll bivouac in the desert.

312
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,320
Desert Team, gather around.

313
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,550
(Let's not have foolish hopes and just sleep in the desert.)

314
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,650
- Let's go to the desert!
 - Come here.

315
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,180
All right. Now we have the desert team.

316
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,850
Those five will go to the resort.

317
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,320
(The unlucky 4 have formed a bivouacking team.)

318
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,990
Ji Hyo is included in that team.

319
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,420
- And...
 - Wait.

320
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,520
These guys will sleep in the desert.

321
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,920
Why are you excluding yourself?

322
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,850
- You're our leader.
 - What?

323
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,380
- This is crazy.
 - One more thing.

324
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,750
We talked about a luxurious resort in the desert.

325
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,750
We filmed it with this camera. Wear it and you'll see.

326
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,750
- This is where you might sleep.
 - Really?

327
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,450
- Describe it for us.
 - Try it.

328
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,950
- Turn it on.
 - Can I blink?

329
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,880
- This is amazing.
 - It's moving.

330
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,150
If you turn left, you can see the left side.

331
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,850
- Oh, really?
 - That's incredible.

332
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,950
These high-tech glasses don't really look good on you.

333
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,840
You should wear them all the time.

334
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,150
You look great.

335
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,650
Who is this?

336
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,150
Try it.

337
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,950
We should see it now.

338
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,280
Who is this?

339
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,850
- Who?
 - Oh, my.

340
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,950
Is someone there?

341
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,150
I see a beautiful lady.

342
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,320
Let me see!

343
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,250
(I want to see it, too.)

344
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,580
I saw a lady.

345
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,620
- Really?
 - Yes, try it.

346
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
- This is amazing.
 - Can I try?

347
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,320
- Go ahead.
 - Wow.

348
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,980
Wait. I just put them on.

349
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,320
Let's take turns.

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,950
It's incredible.

351
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,650
Give us another pair for Da Hey.

352
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,850
This is...

353
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,150
the desert where four of you will sleep.

354
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,280
- Oh, really?
 - Take a look.

355
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,450
- How is it?
 - This is completely desolate.

356
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,150
- It's a real desert.
 - How is it?

357
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,320
- How does it look?
 - There's nothing in this desert.

358
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
(Four of them will sleep here tonight.)

359
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,540
- Let me see.
 - What is this?

360
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,050
I want to sleep at the hotel.

361
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,180
(I want to sleep at the hotel.)

362
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,370
I want to sleep at the hotel, too.

363
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,480
- Jong Kook...
 - I want to sleep at the hotel.

364
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,780
is persuading me to go skydiving with him.

365
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,320
Jong Kook, are you going to do it?

366
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,580
- Are you going to go skydiving?
 - Yes, I am.

367
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,750
I've always wanted to try skydiving.

368
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Really? Then do it today, Il Woo.

369
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,150
- Do it.
 - You two should do it.

370
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,250
It's decided now.

371
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,160
I hope you two go skydiving and then disappear from the programme.

372
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,980
(Let's get it over with and have some fun.)

373
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,480
- We will freely explore the city.
 - Sure.

374
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,220
- Let's go.
 - Welcome to...

375
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,750
- the land of grasshoppers
 - the land of grasshoppers

376
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,950
Welcome to the land of grasshoppers

377
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,450
(Let's go to the centre of Dubai!)

378
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,650
It'll be so fun.

379
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,050
(7am: Have breakfast and make plans)

380
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,250
Where should I go?

381
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,950
Right, we should decide.

382
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,280
Let's team up, cowards.

383
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,650
I'll start with...

384
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,650
JBR Beach.

385
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,850
I want to try Souk Madinat Jumeirah.

386
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,850
I'm going to go to a cafe after skydiving.

387
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,250
Jong Kook and Il Woo will be free after skydiving.

388
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,480
I envy them.

389
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,150
Are you going to a cafe?

390
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,480
Can only two people go skydiving?

391
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,320
Are you interested?

392
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,650
(Will Da Hey go skydiving?)

393
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,220
I'll go if nobody else wants to.

394
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,350
(She's willing to go skydiving!)

395
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,220
Will it be scary?

396
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,920
(Da Hey joins the skydiving team.)

397
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,780
(Sunglasses are a must when travelling.)

398
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,950
How do I look?

399
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,180
(They prepare themselves for the trip.)

400
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,680
- Kwang Soo.
 - Let's take a picture.

401
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,080
(They prepare themselves for the trip.)

402
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,220
This is going to be fun.

403
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,550
(Should we start the journey?)

404
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,150
(They all depart to different destinations.)

405
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,080
(Running Man in Dubai)

406
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,950
(8am: Jong Kook and Il Woo head to the skydiving place.)

407
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,950
Palm Jumeirah, please.

408
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,540
Yes, thank you.

409
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,850
I had the chance to go skydiving when I was in my 20s.

410
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,780
But I gave that chance to someone else.

411
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,420
And I regretted doing so.

412
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,120
I thought I would have many chances to go skydiving in the future,

413
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,320
but I haven't had one yet.

414
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,950
Now that we're in Dubai,

415
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,740
- we should try it.
 - Of course.

416
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,220
I never imagined I would skydive in Dubai.

417
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,180
Gosh, I'm really looking forward.

418
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,750
My heart is pounding.

419
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,850
Gosh. What should I do?

420
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,750
Why did I volunteer?

421
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,720
(She's starting to regret her decision.)

422
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,850
I can still give up. I'll go there and see...

423
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,450
if I can do it.

424
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,320
(Is she going crazy?)

425
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,550
What should I do?

426
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,050
(She can't keep her fingers still.)

427
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,970
Just talk to me.

428
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,280
(She's getting more and more nervous.)

429
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,520
Mum.

430
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,080
No, no.

431
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,580
I actually do better...

432
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,830
when I'm at the scene.

433
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,350
So...

434
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,050
Really?

435
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,180
Are you really strong?

436
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,950
Don't lie to yourself.

437
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,850
(Have I made the wrong decision?)

438
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,720
My mum says I'm crazy.

439
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,950
Have I really gone crazy?

440
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,180
(Driving through the city for 40 minutes)

441
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,150
(8:40am: Jong Kook, Il Woo and Da Hey arrive)

442
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,850
It says "Skydive Dubai".

443
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,050
(We're here after all.)

444
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,850
We really arrived here.

445
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,880
(Where is this place that fits best for skydiving?)

446
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,850
(Palm Jumeirah, the world's largest artificial island,)

447
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,880
(looks like a hand viewed from above.)

448
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,480
(Sighing)

449
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,750
I'm not nervous.

450
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,890
- Aren't you nervous?
 - No.

451
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,850
I'm getting nervous now that we're here.

452
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm having spaghetti legs.

453
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,850
(The trio arrive at the skydiving place.)

454
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,480
- What is this?
 - We'll be instructed here.

455
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,210
- Should we go this way?
 - This way.

456
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,150
Are we signing the agreement here?

457
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,270
Right, we should do that.

458
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,890
Are we signing an agreement?

459
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,280
I hate signing papers.

460
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,050
(You have to sign an agreement regarding safety.)

461
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,930
Why do we have to sign this?

462
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,380
This feels serious.

463
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,650
Really.

464
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,420
I'm getting nervous.

465
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,480
Gosh.

466
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm going crazy.

467
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,590
Have you ever bungee jumped before?

468
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,080
No, I have never done anything like that.

469
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,280
- And you came here?
 - I'm crazy, right?

470
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,170
I think I'm out of my mind.

471
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,950
- Probably.
 - You haven't tried anything?

472
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,750
Gosh. I think she might faint.

473
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,850
At water parks,

474
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,750
they have steep slides.

475
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,120
- Oh, those.
 - They have slides there.

476
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,150
Even those...

477
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,720
almost gave me a heart attack.

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,590
You can't compare this with slides.

479
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,850
- We're jumping off a plane.
 - Exactly.

480
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,920
Have you looked out the window on a plane?

481
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,250
- That's how high this will be.
 - Wait.

482
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,420
"Jumping off a plane"?

483
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,380
- Yes.
 - Are we?

484
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,650
- Of course.
 - Yes, we are.

485
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,220
- Then what did you think?
 - I thought...

486
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,380
(I thought...)

487
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,150
- it'd be like bungee jumping.
 - That's nonsense.

488
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,680
- Gosh.
 - We're actually jumping off...

489
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,990
- an aeroplane.
 - It's true.

490
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,590
- I had no idea.
 - Really?

491
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,950
Are we really jumping off an aeroplane?

492
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,420
- Yes.
 - We'll jump off an airplane.

493
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,890
The plane's door will be open.

494
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,980
- Seriously?
 - What should I do?

495
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,780
- Did you really not know?
 - Are you sure?

496
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,330
Da Hey didn't know we're jumping off a plane.

497
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,280
She thought this would be like bungee jumping.

498
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,850
I thought we would jump off a tall building.

499
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,550
Wouldn't it be the same?

500
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,650
How many times do I have to tell you that we're riding an aeroplane?

501
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,150
While the plane's flying, we'll be jumping off.

502
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,180
Planes go up as high as the clouds.

503
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,480
And we'll jump from there.

504
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,280
- Like airborne troops?
 - Exactly.

505
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,750
- Like airborne troops?
 - Yes.

506
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,050
It's something like that.

507
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,720
(I must be dreaming.)

508
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,890
Or you can just give up now and go straight to the desert.

509
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,750
(They need to invest time into preparing for this.)

510
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,850
Wait.

511
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,480
(They need to invest time into preparing for this.)

512
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,650
Should I give up?

513
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,750
I don't think I can jump off an aeroplane.

514
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,450
(If she wants to give up, she should decide while she still can.)

515
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,950
(Will she take the challenge?)

516
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,350
(Or will she give up?)

517
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,550
I'm nervous.

518
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,380
(What will Da Hey choose to do?)

519
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,950
This is crazy.

520
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,050
(Palm Jumeirah, sky diving)

521
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,220
(Haha and Kwang Soo go to...)

522
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,620
(JBR Beach.)

523
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,740
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes?

524
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,950
I don't want to sleep in the desert.

525
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,890
But it's a shame.

526
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,920
We have to at least take a bath.

527
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,350
You've never heard about how it's like in the desert, right?

528
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,980
I heard it's really cold.

529
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,000
It gets unbelievably cold at night.

530
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,220
I could never do it.

531
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,620
(He can't stay at the desert.)

532
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,750
Jae Seok, Seok Jin and Gary fit the desert.

533
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,220
- We're too...
 - Stylish? How should I put it?

534
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,780
We fit into hotels better.

535
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,050
- Who does?
 - Us.

536
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,150
Us? Gosh...

537
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,020
We're too sophisticated.

538
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,550
I thought there wouldn't be traffic in Dubai, but there is.

539
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,280
Dubai is five times bigger than Seoul...

540
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,740
in terms of area.

541
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,220
- But...
 - What?

542
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,420
It's five times bigger than Seoul.

543
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,050
Than how much bigger is it than Korea?

544
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,380
Don't show off your knowledge...

545
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,120
when you don't know anything.

546
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,380
I'm sure it's smaller than Korea.

547
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Gosh...

548
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,920
- You are so frustrating.
 - All right.

549
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,050
Okay.

550
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,320
Can you ask in English when the shuttle bus...

551
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,090
for Dubai Mall departs?

552
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,780
- Ask what time it departs.
 - You should do it.

553
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,020
- You should do it.
 - You shouldn't be intimidated.

554
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,250
Dubai Mall. Shuttle bus.

555
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,800
What time?

556
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,020
- That will do.
 - Gosh...

557
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,550
Take it slowly. You don't have to rush.

558
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,780
(Enroll in Seok Jin's breakthrough English conversation class now!)

559
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,150
You are impossible.

560
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,650
Do you want me to talk to the driver?

561
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,650
- Don't. He's driving.
 - Sir.

562
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,420
- Married?
 - Yes, married.

563
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,940
Yes.

564
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,650
How many daughters... And how many sons?

565
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,950
I have two daughters.

566
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,550
- Two daughters?
 - I will tell you...

567
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,280
how you sound in...

568
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,420
- I can manage.
 - Korean.

569
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,320
- How does it sound?
 - "Sir, married?"

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,420
(It sounds very awkward.)

571
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,590
(These two words have completed a question.)

572
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,180
- Sir, married?
 - Sir, married?

573
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,750
How many sons? How many daughters?

574
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,180
Right.

575
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,650
- And he understood.
 - That's how it sounded.

576
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,550
- But he understood.
 - That's how it sounded like.

577
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,420
- How many sons?
 - Gosh...

578
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,550
How many daughters?

579
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,650
(Meanwhile, they enter a mysterious gate.)

580
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,550
This is Dubai's... Are we there?

581
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,430
(Is it here?)

582
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,320
Finally, we arrived in Dubai.

583
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
- We arrived at the heart of Dubai.
 - Let's go.

584
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,950
Let's go.

585
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,280
- This place is... Souk...
 - Souk...

586
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
- Madinat...
 - Madinat...

587
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,780
- Jumeirah.
 - Jumeirah.

588
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,110
- Souk Madinat Jumeirah.
 - What is this place for?

589
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,780
- It's a market.
 - What?

590
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,580
- It's a traditional market.
 - It's a market.

591
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,350
Look.

592
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,420
It's very beautiful.

593
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,420
(It's a stylish version of a traditional Dubai market.)

594
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:09,420
(It's filled with traditional products, antiques and food.)

595
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,120
- So it's here.
 - This is...

596
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Look, Seok Jin.

597
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,780
You may not know well since you're still a rookie.

598
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,950
You punk.

599
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,050
(Jae Seok teases Seok Jin.)

600
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,320
Am I a rookie?

601
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
You are less experienced than me.

602
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
You became a comedian two years later than I did.

603
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,050
- I did.
 - That's why I'm telling you this.

604
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,920
- Okay.
 - You must have no experience.

605
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,850
- So I will guide you.
 - We did "Entertainment Weekly".

606
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,280
We were on it together.

607
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,320
- And you got fired.
 - He got fired...

608
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
- You got fired.
 - three weeks after I got fired.

609
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,920
- Let's go inside.
 - Let's go.

610
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
It's not on the outside,

611
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,050
so you think it's inside.

612
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,850
Like I said earlier,

613
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,540
the temperature during the day...

614
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,750
is perfect right now.

615
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,320
- It's perfect. It's like summer.
 - It's...

616
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,420
the perfect weather.

617
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,280
It's much cooler than Korea's summer.

618
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,250
- That's the weather.
 - You have to come to Dubai now.

619
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,280
I am wearing three layers, but it's not too hot.

620
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,550
(They enter Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

621
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,650
- Is this the traditional market?
 - All right.

622
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,780
How can a traditional market be so stylish?

623
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,850
Please show the ceiling.

624
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,550
It's gorgeous.

625
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,950
This is...

626
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,380
- It looks very luxurious.
 - This place is...

627
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,150
very luxurious for a traditional market.

628
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,320
Those are so nice.

629
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,550
(It's too beautiful to be a traditional market.)

630
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,020
"Gold to go".

631
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,150
That must be the gold vending machine.

632
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,550
They said there was a gold vending machine here.

633
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,220
- There really...
 - It's a gold vending machine.

634
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,920
It must be a gold vending machine.

635
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,950
- "Gold to go".
 - "Gold"...

636
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,650
- "The gold ATM".
 - "Gold"...

637
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,950
They have a gold vending machine here.

638
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,420
You swipe your credit card here.

639
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,650
(Instead of drinks, there is gold.)

640
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,550
- This is gold.
 - You can get gold from here.

641
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,530
This is a gold vending machine.

642
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,750
"Gold to go".

643
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,150
(They thought Ji Hyo was kidding.)

644
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,020
- This is fascinating.
 - "The gold ATM".

645
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,650
Ji Hyo was right.

646
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,420
(What are Ji Hyo and Gary doing at this hour?)

647
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,050
I doubt it's going to be a legitimate desert.

648
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,420
I doubt we have to...

649
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,280
make a fire like in the old movies...

650
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,450
and sit with our backs together.

651
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,880
(Ji Hyo is in deep sleep.)

652
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,850
(Whom was he talking to?)

653
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,280
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

654
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,480
Ji Hyo, there's the sea.

655
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,650
There is the sea.

656
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,380
There is the sea on our left.

657
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,680
Wow, Gary!

658
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,850
- That's amazing.
 - We are here.

659
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,020
- Wow...
 - This is so nice.

660
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,150
(The golden beach and emerald sea are seen from afar.)

661
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,050
Dubai is amazing.

662
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,380
(Jumeirah Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Dubai.)

663
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,980
Let's go look at the beach.

664
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,950
Look at the boat over there.

665
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,050
(Burj Al Arab can be seen from here.)

666
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,680
- Even the boat looks nice.
 - It looks very nice.

667
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
(Burj Al Arab can be seen from here.)

668
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,320
The water is so clean.

669
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,580
This is crazy.

670
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,750
(Gary is amazed.)

671
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,630
(Wow!)

672
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,720
- Look at the water.
 - Look at the colour.

673
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,850
(Photo time)

674
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,480
- That should be the background.
 - Okay.

675
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,270
(They take a photo with Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach.)

676
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,350
(Are they on their honeymoon?)

677
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,420
It looks amazing here.

678
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,380
It's the sea!

679
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,050
We came to a beach in Dubai!

680
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,850
Ji Hyo, you slept the whole time.

681
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,150
(The view instantly wakes her up.)

682
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,580
- Ji Hyo.
 - Look at this, Gary.

683
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,520
Isn't it beautiful?

684
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,380
The clam shell looks like you.

685
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,750
(The white clam shell is as beautiful as you.)

686
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,020
The beach looks like you.

687
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,750
(You're like the sea.)

688
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,780
(Ji Hyo and Gary's hearts...)

689
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,480
(start to pound slowly.)

690
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,050
Ji Hyo, this is really nice!

691
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,580
- Is it nice?
 - Yes!

692
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,050
I will go all the way there.

693
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,420
(They are in Jumeirah Beach and Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

694
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,250
(JBR Beach)

695
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,850
(Where are Haha and Kwang Soo?)

696
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,480
This is fantastic.

697
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,650
- This is too pretty.
 - The weather is...

698
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,850
- It's really pretty.
 - unbelievable.

699
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,950
- They scream luxury.
 - The buildings are...

700
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,650
(The slim high-rises are exuding their charms.)

701
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,020
Where is the beach?

702
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,050
It's on the right.

703
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,650
This is too beautiful.

704
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,720
(Wow.)

705
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,280
- It's too beautiful.
 - The weather is amazing.

706
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,330
(A beach can be seen in front of a concrete jungle.)

707
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,280
This is too beautiful.

708
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,250
- It's...
 - It's too beautiful.

709
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,100
JDR.

710
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,150
- This is crazy.
 - This is...

711
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,420
- Hey.
 - Hey.

712
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,830
(It's an area where many foreigners reside.)

713
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,680
This is freedom!

714
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,650
Kwang Soo, I am so happy. Really, I am so happy.

715
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,750
(They are in awe.)

716
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm glad we came here.

717
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,780
(They are in awe.)

718
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,220
This is crazy.

719
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,150
Don't look at them.

720
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,740
- Pretend we're not tourists.
 - Act natural.

721
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,320
Hi.

722
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,650
- Hi.
 - Good morning.

723
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,050
(They are tourists.)

724
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,380
We totally look like locals.

725
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,080
(They can think whatever they want.)

726
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,150
Hi.

727
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,350
(Kwang Soo greets the locals.)

728
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,420
Kwang Soo, this is really crazy.

729
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,550
(He continues to pretend to be a local.)

730
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,280
(Wow.)

731
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,320
This is a work of art.

732
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,480
(It's as beautiful as art.)

733
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,750
(Kwang Soo walks on the soft sand.

734
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,450
(He looks at a girl in bikini.)

735
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,850
(And he smiles.)

736
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,880
(He wasn't expecting this, but he's loving it.)

737
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,920
(He wanders around them.)

738
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,350
Hi.

739
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,350
(But they don't answer him back.)

740
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,050
(They didn't hear me, right?)

741
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,720
(Yes, that must be it.)

742
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,380
- They recognise me in Dubai.
 - Really?

743
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,220
Do you know me?

744
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,000
(She nods.)

745
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,850
- Say my name.
 - Haha.

746
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,780
(She recognises Haha.)

747
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,050
How do you know me?

748
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,420
(We can tell that she's a big fan of Haha.)

749
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,880
She likes me a lot.

750
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,960
- Do you know us?
 - Yes, I know you.

751
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,950
I can speak a little Korean.

752
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,650
- Are you from Dubai?
 - Yes, I am from Dubai.

753
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,650
They watch Running Man in Dubai? Do you watch...

754
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,120
- Yes. It's number one.
 - Running Man?

755
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,420
- Is it number one?
 - It's number one.

756
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh my gosh!

757
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
- Where are you from?
 - Dubai.

758
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,580
Dubai? Really?

759
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,320
She said our show ranks first place here.

760
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,280
Nice to meet you. Can I shake her hand?

761
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,550
Nice to meet you.

762
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,050
High-five!

763
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,750
- Hurry.
 - Do you want a picture?

764
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,120
Thank you.

765
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,950
Oh my gosh...

766
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,420
(They take a photo together.)

767
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,550
Give me five dollars.

768
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,920
(Haha asks her for 5 dollars.)

769
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,320
(He's kidding.)

770
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
- Just kidding.
 - Just kidding.

771
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,120
(They gave a Dubai fan a great laugh.)

772
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,730
Okay. See you.

773
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,250
- Bye. Thank you.
 - Thank you. Bye.

774
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,420
This place is too nice.

775
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,580
(JBR Beach is the best place to relax.)

776
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,750
What do we do?

777
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,220
The weather and everything...

778
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,080
Hey, there's a flag over there! There's a flag in the middle...

779
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,850
- There is a flag.
 - Oh, a flag!

780
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,280
- It came out of nowhere.
 - That was unexpected.

781
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,420
I'm so embarrassed.

782
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,550
- How could you put them here?
 - Wait.

783
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,180
Tell them to take them out.

784
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,650
- I'm so embarrassed.
 - We looked totally like locals.

785
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,850
I am seriously in love with this place.

786
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,680
Gosh, I am so happy.

787
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,380
They must be shooting something. There are cameras.

788
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,950
- Are you shooting something?
 - Is something going on?

789
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,120
They're shooting something.

790
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,880
We're just on a trip here.

791
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,920
(Are you really going to ignore us?)

792
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,220
- Please draw the cameras off.
 - Please.

793
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,850
Please shoot from a distant.

794
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,050
What would these free people think about us?

795
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,250
Look how relaxed the people here are.

796
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
- Right?
 - We'd look strange to them.

797
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,950
Someone's even jogging. Hi.

798
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,420
- Hi.
 - She looks very healthy.

799
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,550
You can do it.

800
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,940
Look at their bright smiles.

801
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,950
- Right.
 - No one seems to be angry here.

802
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,750
- Hi, brother.
 - Hi.

803
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,320
(They greet each other so naturally.)

804
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
- High-five?
 - High-five.

805
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,450
- Bye.
 - Bye.

806
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,830
You look like a local here.

807
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,150
(I'm a true Dubaian.)

808
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,580
You're a local!

809
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,350
I am so happy now.

810
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,550
- We have two flags here.
 - Yes.

811
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,680
You have two games to choose from.

812
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,050
Just choose one of them.

813
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,050
We'll start with the game with one star.

814
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,480
This game, with one stamp, is called "Gestures".

815
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,780
Describe the given words with your body gestures to foreigners,

816
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,750
and if they get 7 correct answers in 90 seconds, you succeed.

817
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,220
- Seven questions?
 - In 90 seconds?

818
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,780
Please find a person to play with...

819
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,630
and bring him or her here. Then we'll start the game.

820
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,880
Please go first.

821
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,850
(This must be difficult.)

822
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,280
Can you play a game with me?

823
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,780
- Do you have time?
 - Time?

824
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,180
Let's play a game.

825
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,680
- Okay. What's your name?
 - Gosh.

826
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,050
- What's your name? Andy?
 - Andy.

827
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,680
- Where are you from?
 - I'm from Italy.

828
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,050
Italy. Wow.

829
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,380
You're revealing too much.

830
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,550
Oh, you're from Italy.

831
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,150
("Gestures" with this Italian man starts now.)

832
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,520
Way to go!

833
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,730
Get ready and...

834
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,250
start.

835
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,550
(He's bewildered.)

836
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,450
How should I describe a sloth?

837
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,950
(He moves onto the next question.)

838
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,480
- Penguin.
 - Yes, it is penguin.

839
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,330
- Yes!
 - Hamster?

840
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,420
It's like a mouse.

841
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,150
What are you doing?

842
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,220
What is that?

843
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,480
This sounds like this.

844
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,750
I like "hams".

845
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,920
- It's a tiger.
 - I like "hams".

846
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,220
Tiger? Tiger?

847
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,680
- No!
 - It's a lion then, a lion.

848
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,150
- Lion.
 - No!

849
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,950
I like "hams".

850
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,920
- It must be puma.
 - Puma.

851
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,050
It's a puma. Yes!

852
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,850
- No!
 - Yes!

853
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,150
(He was tricked by Haha.)

854
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,720
No.

855
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,450
It's a gorilla.

856
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,220
You just said the answer.

857
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,850
- It's gorilla in English, too.
 - Gorilla is English.

858
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,950
I got it. Okay.

859
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,150
- Start.
 - Gary looks like this.

860
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,850
(Gary looks just like this.)

861
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,150
(Would he know Gary's nickname?)

862
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,320
Gary and this look similar.

863
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,220
(Gary looks just like this.)

864
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,650
- Kangaroo.
 - It's a squid.

865
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,580
- Kangaroo.
 - No, that's not it...

866
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,680
It has 12 legs.

867
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
- It has 13 legs.
 - That is not...

868
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,150
It has 30 legs!

869
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,530
There's no animal like that.

870
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,650
- 30 legs?
 - It has a square-shaped head.

871
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,880
- Monster.
 - No, it's not a monster.

872
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,780
- It has square-shaped head.
 - It's a webfoot octopus.

873
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,150
- Webfoot octopus!
 - Webfoot octopus?

874
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,220
No, that's not it!

875
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,180
- The answer isn't webfoot octopus.
 - Webfoot octopus.

876
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,720
Webfoot octopus!

877
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,050
Thank you.

878
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,150
Webfoot octopus.

879
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,220
(Mission failed.)

880
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,950
- Thank you.
 - Webfoot octopus...

881
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,580
- Wow.
 - You're hilarious.

882
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,850
I feel strange to hear a foreigner say "webfoot octopus" in Korean.

883
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,780
How would you describe squid with your body?

884
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,330
Squid?

885
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,180
- You got it.
 - What?

886
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,150
- Yes, good.
 - Is that different from this?

887
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,550
- That's a webfoot octopus.
 - Webfoot octopus?

888
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,110
(Kwang Soo, what you're describing is closer to a webfoot octopus.)

889
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,850
(JBR Beach)

890
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,180
(Souk Madinat Jumeirah)

891
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,280
What is that?

892
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,920
This is amazing.

893
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,150
- What a nice view.
 - Wow, what is that?

894
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,950
(What are they looking at?)

895
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,420
This place has a great view.

896
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,190
I like it here.

897
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,950
- Look at that boat.
 - Wow, look.

898
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,680
I want to ride that.

899
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
This place is fantastic.

900
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
(What mission would they have to clear in such a pleasurable place?)

901
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,950
Come look at this.

902
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,820
- What's that?
 - There's the R flag.

903
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,750
(They find the R flag near the Abra dock.)

904
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,420
- Okay.
 - What is that?

905
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,340
- This is Souk Madinat Jumeirah.
 - Okay.

906
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,920
This is a water transportation called "abra ride".

907
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,990
- Do people really ride them?
 - Yes.

908
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,020
Why don't you ride it and...

909
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,320
- take a look around.
 - Really?

910
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,450
- Can we get on now?
 - Okay.

911
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,620
- Hi.
 - How are you?

912
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,620
- I'm fine.
 - I'm fine, thank you. And you?

913
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,580
- Thank you.
 - You speak English very naturally.

914
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,950
We can answer this automatically.

915
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,950
- We must be able to say this.
 - I'm fine, thank you. And you?

916
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,420
So do we sit here?

917
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,850
Yes, we sit here.

918
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,080
I like this a lot.

919
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,220
How fast would this go?

920
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,470
(Jae Seok burst into laughter.)

921
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,830
He has never been a reporter in other countries.

922
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,450
He doesn't know what to say when he's shooting outside like this.

923
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,650
You sound awkward.

924
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,880
Have you been reporting in other countries then?

925
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,450
Have you? You've never done it either.

926
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,580
Tell me if you have.

927
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,820
Oh my goodness.

928
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,380
- You're so funny.
 - This place is very nice.

929
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,720
Hi!

930
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,650
What a beautiful family!

931
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,220
The family looks beautiful.

932
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,150
- The kids are very cute.
 - They are cute.

933
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,380
How could they all have blond hair?

934
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,950
The kids are blond because their mother is blond.

935
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,550
It's because their mother is blond. Haven't you learned about genes?

936
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,550
Seok Jin, this is what reporters do.

937
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,050
- Reporters should mention...
 - All right.

938
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,320
- things like this.
 - Their parents are blond, so...

939
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,050
- their children are blond, too.
 - Gosh.

940
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,480
What's our mission today? Is it riding this abra ride?

941
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,150
Isn't it too easy?

942
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,680
- This place is...
 - This place is so beautiful.

943
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,550
Look at this emerald ocean.

944
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,120
(They ride along the emerald ocean.)

945
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,150
- They're having lunch there.
 - They're eating.

946
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,780
(People are having lunch near this fantastic emerald ocean.)

947
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,580
It's so fabulous.

948
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,650
This place is...

949
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,350
so great.

950
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,150
These buildings are all hotels.

951
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,220
(They pass under a bridge.)

952
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,950
I never thought Running Man would let us relax like this.

953
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,050
- Right.
 - Thank you.

954
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,920
I love travelling freely like this.

955
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,560
- I really enjoy this freedom.
 - Right.

956
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,670
The water is so clear.

957
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,850
I can see the bottom. It's very clean.

958
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,420
This is sea water.

959
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,150
- No.
 - This is sea water, Seok Jin.

960
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,580
How could this be sea water?

961
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,980
Then drink some.

962
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,680
It must be salty.

963
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,290
Everyone, I'll taste this water...

964
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,780
to see if this is sea water or not.

965
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,280
Let's play the rock-paper-scissors.

966
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,350
- The one who loses...
 - I bet you want to find out...

967
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,650
- if this is sea water or not.
 - Is this sea water or...

968
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,950
- lake water?
 - We'll try this water and see...

969
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,580
if it's sea water or not.

970
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,950
- Rock, paper and scissors.
 - Rock, paper and scissors.

971
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,050
(Who will taste it?)

972
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,630
I lost.

973
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,740
I lost, so I'll taste it.

974
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,220
We always keep our words.

975
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,850
- Try it.
 - You shouldn't doubt me.

976
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,630
- Hurry.
 - Okay.

977
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,850
Here I go.

978
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,680
(Seok Jin licks his fingers.)

979
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,780
It is salty!

980
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,750
(It is salty.)

981
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,950
- See?
 - It's salty, so it is sea water.

982
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,950
- I told you.
 - It is salty.

983
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,320
This water comes from the ocean.

984
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,750
It is really salty.

985
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,520
Is it really sea water?

986
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,380
Of course, it is.

987
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,780
What's our mission today?

988
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,150
I see nothing from here.

989
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,730
I see nothing either.

990
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,950
Come on.

991
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,350
I don't see anything from here. What's our mission today?

992
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,250
We were here before.

993
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,050
That is where we started.

994
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,950
(The ride came back to the dock.)

995
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,080
What's the mission? I saw nothing.

996
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,850
We're already back where we started.

997
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,050
- Thank you.
 - Thank you, boss.

998
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,950
I feel like we've already failed our mission.

999
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,320
- I have no clue.
 - What is it?

1000
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,650
What is our mission today?

1001
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,680
- Here comes the question.
 - Okay.

1002
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,220
(They are given a question.)

1003
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,720
While you were riding the ride,

1004
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,550
how many bridges did you pass?

1005
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,940
(How many bridges did they pass?)

1006
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,520
This is ridiculous.

1007
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,720
- Isn't that too much?
 - Bridges?

1008
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,650
- You passed under the bridges.
 - Right.

1009
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,490
So how many of them did you pass?

1010
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,680
(We surely passed through bridges...)

1011
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,780
I'll just say any number that comes to my mind.

1012
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,850
Jae Seok and I will say the number separately.

1013
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,150
Please whisper the number to us.

1014
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,320
We should just make a guess.

1015
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
(We have no choice but to just guess.)

1016
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,450
(Seok Jin whispers.)

1017
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,720
(Seok Jin's answer is 6.)

1018
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,420
(What is Jae Seok's number?)

1019
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,080
(Now, Jae Seok whispers.)

1020
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,780
Why are you asking me how many there were?

1021
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,480
Why are you asking him for an answer??

1022
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,720
Why are you asking...

1023
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,150
Gosh.

1024
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,780
- Hey, give me another chance.
 - Please.

1025
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,780
Let me say it again.

1026
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,220
- Give me another chance.
 - Please.

1027
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,880
Let's move on to the next flag.

1028
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
- How many were there?
 - This is driving me crazy.

1029
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,580
Were there 7? Or 8?

1030
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,090
(How many bridges did they pass?)

1031
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,850
What's the mission today? Do we just need to ride this?

1032
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,650
Isn't it too easy?

1033
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,350
Seok Jin, I love this place.

1034
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,150
It's so beautiful here.

1035
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,650
(The answer is 7.)

1036
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,950
(Frustrated)

1037
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,420
This is such a ridiculous mission.

1038
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,050
How would we possibly know that?

1039
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,780
You took us to this beautiful place and...

1040
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,450
- True. We never expected this.
 - It's ridiculous.

1041
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,680
Gosh.

1042
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,320
Isn't the question a total nonsense?

1043
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
(They can't believe it.)

1044
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,880
The question was seriously nonsense.

1045
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,740
I think you went too far.

1046
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,730
(Angry Jae Seok and Seok Jin move on to the next mission.)

1047
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,680
Measure your height and weight, and then bring the consent form.

1048
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
(These three people who chose skydiving...)

1049
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,250
(measure their heights and weights to ensure their safety.)

1050
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,750
Is this right?

1051
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,050
What is this?

1052
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,220
(Her weight has been disclosed to everyone.)

1053
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,580
Oh my goodness.

1054
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,850
Just so you know, I went on the scale...

1055
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,950
- with all my clothes on.
 - You even had your mic on.

1056
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,880
And I even had the mic on me.

1057
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,520
(No one said anything about you.)

1058
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,680
(She becomes even more nervous after the physical examination.)

1059
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,150
(She holds her hands tightly.)

1060
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,070
You are not praying, are you?

1061
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,420
You look like you're praying.

1062
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,580
(Trembling)

1063
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,980
I held my hands so tightly that my fingers are numb.

1064
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,190
(Sighing)

1065
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,950
I can't do this.

1066
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,550
I'm leaving. I can't do it.

1067
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,320
Don't you think I should give up?

1068
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,680
- Why?
 - I'm really scared.

1069
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,420
I'm scared. I think I'm going to go crazy.

1070
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,750
Gosh, that hurt.

1071
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,450
(She bumps her bottom.)

1072
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,620
Gosh. I'm out of my mind.

1073
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:09,250
(Da Hey is panicking. Will she be able to skydive?)

1074
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,380
I'm going insane.

1075
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,680
Okay.

1076
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,850
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is putting on his gear.)

1077
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,980
Yes. Perfect. And chin up. You will be flying forward.

1078
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,640
Are you all right? So, we'll do something like that.

1079
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,680
- Does it sound like fun? Ready?
 - Yes.

1080
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,320
High-five. Let's go skydive.

1081
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,290
(Jong Kook, Il Woo and Da Hey are all ready.)

1082
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,880
(They take a photo before taking off.)

1083
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,380
(Although I look like I'm smiling, I'm not really smiling inside.)

1084
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,880
Oh, goodness.

1085
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,580
Oh, my.

1086
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,980
- But I think you can do it.
 - Okay.

1087
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,350
But why are my hands trembling?

1088
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,990
My hands are trembling. Really.

1089
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,180
It would be strange not to tremble.

1090
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,880
If you succeed this mission, you will receive 10 stamps.

1091
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,180
If you succeed,

1092
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
you will not receive a penalty.

1093
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,380
(If they succeed, they will sleep at the finest desert hotel tonight.)

1094
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,430
Please keep in mind that you will go in 10 minutes.

1095
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,950
If you step out that door,

1096
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,380
we can't take the cameras with us.

1097
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,780
- So are we on our own?
 - Yes.

1098
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,420
(They have to overcome this on their own.)

1099
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,050
Are we on our own?

1100
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,850
They say it's an altitude of 3,962m.

1101
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,080
- What?
 - What?

1102
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,780
(What? 3,926m?)

1103
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,880
- No, they told us it's 1,219m.
 - They told us it's 1,219m.

1104
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,490
No, it's from 3,926m to 4,267m.

1105
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,080
- What?
 - Well,

1106
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,550
- 3000m is not that high.
 - That's impossible.

1107
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,640
My face is getting hot.

1108
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,380
- It needs to be at least 3,962m.
 - We must have heard it wrong.

1109
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,580
- Did we hear him wrong?
 - Was it really 4,267m?

1110
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,680
- We must've heard him wrong.
 - I think so.

1111
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,880
(They will go higher than Mount Baekdu which is 2,744m tall.)

1112
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
- It's 3,962m.
 - 3,962m?

1113
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,850
(It's too late to change missions.)

1114
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,850
(Wailing)

1115
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,990
- What should I do?
 - We'll be okay.

1116
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,280
(She's lost for words.)

1117
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,850
Really. This is going to be difficult.

1118
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,180
(Jong Kook and Il Woo are nervous, too.)

1119
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,650
If you can give up now we will...

1120
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,050
I'm nervous, but I want to do this.

1121
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,420
- I'm nervous.
 - We'll give you one last chance...

1122
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,880
- to change your mind.
 - Will there be...

1123
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,850
a pressure that is unbearable?

1124
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,990
It differs for every person.

1125
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,580
(Not everyone will feel the same.)

1126
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,880
I think it'll be scary only when you jump.

1127
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,880
- If we change our minds...
 - The phones are over there.

1128
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,550
They say we can change our minds.

1129
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,080
This is my last chance.

1130
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,480
(It's her last chance to back out.)

1131
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,580
(Will she be able to do this?)

1132
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,380
(It's an opportunity to avoid sleeping out in the desert.)

1133
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,620
(But in order to do so, they need to jump from 3,962m.)

1134
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,080
(What decision will she make?)

1135
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,320
No.

1136
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,780
No. No.

1137
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,200
Da Hey keeps talking to herself.

1138
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,790
She's talking to herself.

1139
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,080
If you make a decision,

1140
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,980
- you should go with it.
 - You're right.

1141
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,080
(I'm a woman of my word.)

1142
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,480
No.

1143
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,550
(Although he doesn't show it, Jong Kook is very nervous, too.)

1144
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,520
This is insane. I'm wordless.

1145
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,680
(I should have chosen an easier mission.)

1146
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,080
(Here's a person who's free from worldly cares.)

1147
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,980
(This is great.)

1148
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:26,790
(Gary and Ji Hyo are still acting like the lovely Monday Couple.)

1149
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,220
(They are having fun under the warm sun.)

1150
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,380
Good luck!

1151
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,780
(If they move enough sand, they will win.)

1152
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,180
Go, go!

1153
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,290
Okay!

1154
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,780
(Oh, no. The basket tipped over.)

1155
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,660
(Oh, no, Gary!)

1156
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,290
Okay!

1157
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,680
(It's not okay...)

1158
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,880
Okay.

1159
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,720
What is this?

1160
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,180
(Team Gary wasted 20 seconds.)

1161
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,290
(He misses.)

1162
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,180
Hurry up. Hurry up. Faster!

1163
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,270
Pour it!

1164
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,950
(They have less than 30 seconds. They need to hurry.)

1165
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,580
Give me more.

1166
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,990
(He misses again.)

1167
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,480
Good!

1168
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,980
Let's do this!

1169
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,050
Pour the sand!

1170
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:31,680
(Please hold on.)

1171
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,980
(I didn't come here to do hard labour.)

1172
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,380
(Go, Gary.)

1173
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,680
(They have about 10 seconds left, but the bucket isn't full yet.)

1174
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,280
Quickly! Quickly!

1175
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,580
(It's a close game. They need to hurry.)

1176
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,380
We're going to make it for sure.

1177
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,750
- We did it.
 - Finished!

1178
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,970
Oh, my goodness!

1179
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,320
Good job.

1180
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,480
(Gary succeeds!)

1181
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,100
I'm sorry!

1182
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,680
- Thank you so much!
 - You're welcome.

1183
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,280
(Gary earns 2 stamps.)

1184
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,680
We've come all the way here. I need to do something.

1185
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,340
What is this?

1186
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,580
I'll begin.

1187
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,680
(They need to squeeze water out of this wet towel in order to win.)

1188
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,880
Oh, my.

1189
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,180
(She is doing the mission with a newlywed bride.)

1190
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,950
Here.

1191
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,250
You're doing great.

1192
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,380
Hurry, hurry!

1193
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,660
They're doing great.

1194
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,680
(I don't think we'll need a washing machine.)

1195
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,080
I don't think I'll be able to do this.

1196
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,420
(They squeeze it until the last drop.)

1197
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,780
- I'm so tired!
 - That's enough.

1198
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,280
You won.

1199
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,680
You have succeeded.

1200
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,780
(Ji Hyo succeeds!)

1201
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,850
(Thanks to the newlywed bride)

1202
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,280
Thank you.

1203
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,980
How could you...

1204
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,660
do this to a newlywed?

1205
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,680
I think you should just go to sleep tonight.

1206
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,880
(She used all her energy.)

1207
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,220
- Have a great honeymoon.
 - Thank you.

1208
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,420
Take care of yourself.

1209
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,880
Thank you.

1210
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,280
(Stamping)

1211
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,920
- Dubai!
 - Dubai!

1212
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,680
(Ji Hyo got 1 and Gary got 2.)

1213
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,020
Is this really not possible?

1214
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,780
I have no clue.

1215
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,380
(Are they thinking about ziplining?)

1216
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,680
I can jump.

1217
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,320
Oh, my.

1218
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,650
- Don't lie.
 - Really.

1219
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,420
I'll make a call and do it.

1220
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,680
- You know you can't.
 - Really.

1221
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,480
- Look at him.
 - I'm serious.

1222
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,680
I bet my whole fortune.

1223
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,420
Really?

1224
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,280
Do you really...

1225
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,580
want to get kicked out from your house by your wife?

1226
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,460
She would really do that, you know.

1227
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,780
I can't jump.

1228
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,480
- We'll go and see.
 - Is it at a shopping centre?

1229
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,380
We don't even have money with us.

1230
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,780
Why? We have 27 dollars.

1231
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,480
What can we buy with 27 dollars?

1232
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,750
What about with 54 dollars?

1233
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,380
It's enough to buy something.

1234
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,780
Yes, it is.

1235
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,780
Seok Jin, you should buy that.

1236
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,980
- It's cheap here.
 - What?

1237
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
Buy oil.

1238
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,880
(Buy oil.)

1239
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,380
Buy 54 dollars worth of oil.

1240
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,180
Bring oil back as a gift.

1241
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,580
Buy some oil.

1242
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,680
Do you think you're making sense?

1243
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,850
It makes perfect sense.

1244
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,550
- Why doesn't it make sense?
 - You should say something to him.

1245
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,080
- Why?
 - So should I go to...

1246
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,780
the supermarket and buy oil as a gift?

1247
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,480
- Is that what you're saying?
 - Yes.

1248
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,750
Are you talking about those gift sets with bottled oil?

1249
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,570
- Should I buy Dubaian oil?
 - Yes, you should.

1250
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,850
It's over there.

1251
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,460
(While they were quarrelling, they have arrived.)

1252
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,680
Okay, thank you.

1253
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,780
(The zipline is hung across the sky.)

1254
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,080
We should get going. Wait a minute.

1255
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,280
(He hesitates.)

1256
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,950
It's doable.

1257
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,780
(Are you sure this is doable?)

1258
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,180
It's doable.

1259
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,280
Which way do we need to go?

1260
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,950
It's this way.

1261
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,480
You're right.

1262
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,750
Which floor is it?

1263
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,050
It's the 28th floor.

1264
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,880
Hello.

1265
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,420
Who's going to jump? Both of you?

1266
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,880
- Yes.
 - Yes.

1267
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,650
- Both of you guys?
 - Yes.

1268
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,950
Signing the consent form makes me nervous.

1269
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,280
(Seok Jin is becoming nervous.)

1270
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,580
Seok Jin.

1271
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,870
If you're scared, just go back down.

1272
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,080
What are you talking about?

1273
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,880
You should go back down if you're scared.

1274
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,650
My goodness.

1275
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:13,480
(They finally reach the starting point of the zipline.)

1276
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,080
Oh, my.

1277
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,280
I don't think I can do it.

1278
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,680
Wow, this is really something.

1279
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,420
- I'll just go and see.
 - Okay.

1280
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,180
I'll just take a look.

1281
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,880
Oh, my gosh!

1282
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,850
(Astonished)

1283
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,720
(This is the Dubai zipline.)

1284
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,080
(They need to jump from 90m high...)

1285
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,480
(and descend on a 600m long rope.)

1286
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,280
Let's think about this.

1287
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,170
- This is driving me crazy.
 - It's...

1288
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,280
scarier than I had expected.

1289
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,080
This is no joke.

1290
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,280
Look at that.

1291
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,180
This is no joke.

1292
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,950
Oh, my.

1293
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,080
(How am I supposed to do this?)

1294
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,880
Gary, let's go buy some snacks.

1295
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,080
This place is very unique.

1296
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,170
(They visit the traditional market, Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

1297
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,480
This place is very fancy.

1298
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,180
Gary, there's ice cream.

1299
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,720
There's ice cream.

1300
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,220
- Should we get one?
 - Let's have some ice cream.

1301
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,680
(They first spend money on ice cream.)

1302
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,880
Excuse me,

1303
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,580
I would like some ice cream on a cone.

1304
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,810
I want one on a cone.

1305
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,580
I want one in a cup.

1306
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,080
The ice cream is on me...

1307
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,650
- since you did so much.
 - No, I'll pay.

1308
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,440
No, I'll buy it.

1309
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,720
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

1310
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,480
This tastes good!

1311
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Maybe it's tasty because we were at the beach.

1312
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,850
Gary, what is that?

1313
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,780
They're cutting it up as if it were yeot.

1314
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,080
"Yeot"?

1315
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,420
(It sounds like something else.)

1316
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,260
Gary, look at that.

1317
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,250
(Is this Middle Eastern yeot?)

1318
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,050
(What is this?)

1319
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,280
Good morning.

1320
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,020
What... What... What is this?

1321
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,880
It's Turkish delight.

1322
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,380
Is it something like candy?

1323
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,550
(Turkish Delight is Middle Eastern taffy made with nuts and sugar.)

1324
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,420
It's like jelly.

1325
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,580
(It's like jelly.)

1326
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,850
Can my girlfriend have a taste?

1327
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,950
(Can my girlfriend have a taste?)

1328
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,220
(Here you go.)

1329
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,820
Thank you.

1330
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,420
I said you're my girlfriend so that he'd let you taste it.

1331
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,650
All right.

1332
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,850
(Chomping)

1333
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,020
It tastes good, right?

1334
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,650
- Wait.
 - It's like jelly with nuts in it.

1335
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,450
I think I tried this before.

1336
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,580
- Can I get a half sized one?
 - All right.

1337
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,850
(Gary decides to buy some.)

1338
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,050
Is it 23 dollars?

1339
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,550
(It costs around 23 dollars.)

1340
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,950
It's too expensive.

1341
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,720
- Okay.
 - Do we have enough money?

1342
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,150
(Gary spent 23 dollars from their pocket money for the taffy.)

1343
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,480
Thank you.

1344
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,440
- Have a good day.
 - Thank you.

1345
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,020
- Gary, let me manage our money.
 - Yes?

1346
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,650
- Let me manage it.
 - Am I spending too much?

1347
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,180
You're too easily persuaded.

1348
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,420
A fortune-teller said the similar thing.

1349
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,380
(A fortune-teller said the similar thing.)

1350
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,180
He said that I should let woman manage my money.

1351
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,050
Give it to me.

1352
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,380
(Gary needs someone to take care of him.)

1353
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,050
Wait. What's that?

1354
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,150
(What's that?)

1355
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,380
- Hello.
 - Hi.

1356
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,220
- Hi.
 - How are you?

1357
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,450
- Fine, thank you.
 - Good.

1358
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,920
If you make a payment, I make this in five minutes.

1359
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,180
It's made of sand. It's amazing.

1360
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,380
Let me show you.

1361
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,950
(Sand art made with different colours of sand)

1362
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,120
It's amazing.

1363
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,050
(Sand art made with different colours of sand)

1364
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,650
Wow!

1365
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,850
(They're impressed)

1366
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,350
Good!

1367
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,680
(But...)

1368
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,650
(it's where they have to complete a mission.)

1369
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,050
You get one stamp if you finish the puzzle before he finishes his work.

1370
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,280
(You get one stamp if you finish the puzzle before he finishes his work.)

1371
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,150
Now? Do we start now?

1372
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,950
This is easy.

1373
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,620
- Let's do it. Do we go one by one?
 - Yes.

1374
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,550
(A match with a sand master)

1375
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,950
Start.

1376
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,920
Wait. Is this the puzzle?

1377
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,220
Oh, this is how you do it.

1378
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,380
(Oh, this is how you do it.)

1379
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,850
- Ji Hyo, I can't do this.
 - Oh, it's the one.

1380
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,950
I can't do this.

1381
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,220
(I can't do this.)

1382
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,380
(He wasn't expecting to use his brain.)

1383
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,780
Ji Hyo, I can't do this.

1384
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,480
- I'm doomed.
 - You can do it. Try.

1385
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,880
You can do it.

1386
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,450
Like this. This one goes here.

1387
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,680
(You can do it, Gary!)

1388
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,050
Well...

1389
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,480
(I need to do something.)

1390
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,580
Sir, I don't like that.

1391
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,750
(She's trying to help Gary.)

1392
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,020
I want this colour.

1393
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,180
(I want this colour.)

1394
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,810
(Ji Hyo is distracting him to buy Gary more time.)

1395
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,180
- Hurry up.
 - Ji Hyo... I...

1396
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,580
(I don't think I can do this.)

1397
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,250
Ji Hyo, I can't do this.

1398
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,350
I can't.

1399
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,280
Hurry up.

1400
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,850
(While Gary is struggling, the sand art is almost done.)

1401
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,250
Ji Hyo.

1402
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,650
Do it slowly, please.

1403
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,880
(Please take your time.)

1404
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,250
(Pushing)

1405
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,420
(What?)

1406
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,960
Oh, it's done.

1407
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,850
(Stunned)

1408
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,220
Is it done?

1409
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,480
(Gary succeeds.)

1410
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,150
Ji Hyo, I did it.

1411
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,420
I finished it without realising it.

1412
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,100
Ji Hyo, I did it! Yes!

1413
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,550
(With Ji Hyo's help, Gary cleared the mission.)

1414
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,550
- It looks so nice.
 - Thank you, Ji Hyo.

1415
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,450
(This is why every man needs a wise woman.)

1416
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,950
Thank you so much.

1417
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,750
(Proud)

1418
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,820
I might have to sleep...

1419
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,150
outside in the desert like this tonight.

1420
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,520
(He might have to sleep outside in the desert like this tonight.)

1421
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,350
I might be sleeping in this desert tonight.

1422
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,680
It's going to be like camping.

1423
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,750
Oh my goodness.

1424
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,650
(They have 3 hours until the end.)

1425
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,280
- So...
 - What will you do?

1426
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,480
- What will you do?
 - Go down if you're scared.

1427
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,950
What are you talking about?

1428
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,550
(Sighing)

1429
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,950
How fast is it?

1430
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,750
It's 70km per hour.

1431
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,480
Did you hear that?

1432
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,970
It takes about 40 seconds to arrive there.

1433
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,850
- Did you say 40 seconds?
 - Yes, 40 seconds.

1434
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,850
- Gosh, 40 seconds.
 - Is it 70 or 17?

1435
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,420
- It's 70km per hour.
 - I see.

1436
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,950
- He says it's 70km per hour.
 - It's 600m long.

1437
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,050
(The course is 600m long.)

1438
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,050
We just need to hold out for 40 seconds.

1439
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,950
Was there any accident?

1440
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,950
Any accident?

1441
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,280
Not today.

1442
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,550
What?

1443
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,750
(Does it mean that there were accidents in the past?)

1444
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,250
(I can't even laugh at a joke.)

1445
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,620
- Was that a joke?
 - Yes.

1446
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,480
- Are you going to do it?
 - I am.

1447
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,060
Let's sign the consent form first.

1448
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,380
- Let's do it.
 - Let's sign first.

1449
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,650
Do you think I can't do this?

1450
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,950
- Fine, I'll sign the paper.
 - Do it.

1451
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,380
You don't know me.

1452
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,150
I can even skydive.

1453
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,550
Who are you trying to fool?

1454
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,330
- Do I sign here?
 - Do it.

1455
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,550
Sit down.

1456
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,020
(It's like they're having an autograph event there.)

1457
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,420
- Gosh.
 - Here.

1458
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,720
- Oh my goodness.
 - Wait.

1459
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,440
Do you have another pen with a different colour?

1460
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,280
- Is it red?
 - It's red coloured.

1461
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,180
(He's scared of writing his name in red.)

1462
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,280
- You must be scared.
 - It's unlucky to write it in red.

1463
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,420
I don't want to be unlucky by writing my name in red.

1464
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,450
No, never.

1465
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,950
Thank you.

1466
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,050
(Signing with a black pen)

1467
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,720
You seem determined.

1468
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,050
Okay.

1469
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,680
(Seok Jin signs on the consent form, too.)

1470
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,580
All right.

1471
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,380
(He's certainly not determined.)

1472
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,960
Okay.

1473
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,280
- Put your left foot in here.
 - Okay.

1474
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,850
(They put on the equipment as soon as they signed the paper.)

1475
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,320
Oh my goodness.

1476
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,950
(They're thrilled to death.)

1477
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,650
We're in trouble.

1478
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,020
- Wait.
 - Wait!

1479
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,320
I'm not going to do this.

1480
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,420
(He's not going to do this.)

1481
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,580
(It's too late to give up.)

1482
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,950
What should I do?

1483
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,150
(Nervous)

1484
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,550
What should I do?

1485
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,950
- This will be tightened up there.
 - Okay.

1486
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,320
Will it be safe?

1487
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,380
(Will it be safe?)

1488
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,880
Okay.

1489
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,750
Seok Jin, I'm going for it now.

1490
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,260
(Seok Jin, I'm going for it now.)

1491
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,720
Jae Seok is really doing it.

1492
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,350
Gosh! I can't do this.

1493
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,650
(Wow)

1494
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,050
Is it not dangerous?

1495
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,580
(Jae Seok is going first for the X-line zipline.)

1496
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,020
Are you sure about it?

1497
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,750
- Seriously?
 - Wait, do I have to film it?

1498
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,580
- You should film yourself.
 - How can I?

1499
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,380
(The cameraman gives him the camera.)

1500
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,840
My heart is pounding.

1501
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,350
Jae Seok.

1502
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,180
I'm going crazy.

1503
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,380
(You should hold the camera like this.)

1504
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,970
- It's too high.
 - What do I film?

1505
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,950
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are going out of control.)

1506
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,420
What about me?

1507
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,580
It's too high.

1508
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,620
(What am I doing here?)

1509
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,420
Jae Seok.

1510
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,580
(Welcome to the X-line zipline.)

1511
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,020
This is not for everybody, you know?

1512
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,380
(Taking off his glasses)

1513
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,950
He is really going to do it.

1514
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,050
(Let's do it.)

1515
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,260
I even have to hold a camera myself.

1516
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,650
Seok Jin.

1517
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:07,850
I'm scared to death.

1518
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,380
(He's scared to death.)

1519
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,950
Jae Seok, let's not do this.

1520
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,550
Come closer.

1521
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,550
(Jae Seok is finally ready.)

1522
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,320
Once it's hooked, there's no turning back.

1523
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,650
(Hooked)

1524
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,480
All right. Slowly sit down now.

1525
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,150
- Okay.
 - He's out of his mind.

1526
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,420
Is he really going to be all right?

1527
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,090
(Jae Seok looks different today.)

1528
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,150
- Lean back.
 - Okay.

1529
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,150
- That camera is...
 - Seok Jin.

1530
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,120
Are you going to do this?

1531
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,380
(Do I look nervous?)

1532
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,950
You're about to take off.

1533
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,180
What should I do? My son must watch it.

1534
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,780
(His heart is pounding crazy.)

1535
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,480
(The producer goes closer to him.)

1536
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,580
- What?
 - You have to memorise...

1537
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,750
the following words after arrival.

1538
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,350
- How will I remember them?
 - Memorise what?

1539
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,550
Do we have a mission on top of that?

1540
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:02,750
What is this?

1541
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,950
(While in his most nervous moment, he receives a mission.)

1542
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,580
(Given words are Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.)

1543
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,380
Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.

1544
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,530
Look at his shaking legs.

1545
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:16,750
Look at his legs.

1546
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,420
(Shaking)

1547
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,750
He's shaking.

1548
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,020
(Deep breathing)

1549
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,320
- This must be a dream.
 - All right.

1550
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,450
Okay.

1551
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,120
It's so terrifying.

1552
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,540
(He's about to start.)

1553
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,750
Oh, my.

1554
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,050
My goodness.

1555
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,550
(My goodness)

1556
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,220
Okay.

1557
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,750
- Do you want to go?
 - Yes.

1558
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,450
- Are you ready?
 - I'm ready.

1559
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,780
Going in five seconds.

1560
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,050
(Going in five seconds)

1561
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,450
(You'd better be prepared for the height and wide distance.)

1562
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,280
(Nervous)

1563
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,650
Going in five seconds.

1564
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,050
In five,

1565
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,720
four,

1566
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,680
three,

1567
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,950
- two...
 - Gosh!

1568
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,270
In 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1.

1569
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,850
(Go!)

1570
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,520
Help me! Mum!

1571
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,850
- In 2 and 1, go!
 - Gosh!

1572
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,750
Help me! Mum!

1573
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,680
- In 2 and 1, go!
 - Gosh!

1574
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,680
Help me! Mum!

1575
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,420
I'm sorry.

1576
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,950
(Jae Seok is flying in the sky!)

1577
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,530
I'm sorry.

1578
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,650
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

1579
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,320
(Is he seeing his life flash before his eyes?)

1580
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,520
(He's looking back on his life.)

1581
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,060
I'm sorry.

1582
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,220
I won't do it again.

1583
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,720
(Screaming)

1584
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,980
(Let me go back.)

1585
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,420
(He suddenly looks so different.)

1586
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,620
I'm thirsty.

1587
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,650
(Welcome back, Jae Seok!)

1588
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,580
(He successfully finished riding the 40-second X-line zipline.)

1589
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,480
(He was terrified.)

1590
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,180
(He wants to go down.)

1591
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,780
(He wants to go home.)

1592
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,480
(He's ragged.)

1593
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,280
(Oh my gosh)

1594
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,950
It was terrifying.

1595
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,550
(He won on the fight against himself.)

1596
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,380
(However, the joy didn't last long.)

1597
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,250
Please give us the answer to the question you received.

1598
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,820
It's Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.

1599
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,050
Correct.

1600
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,080
(He succeeds the mission.)

1601
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,170
(He might be able to avoid sleeping in the desert.)

1602
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,180
(Now, it's time for Seok Jin to ride the zipline.)

1603
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,980
(He's terrified.)

1604
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,830
Gosh.

1605
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,380
I'm going mad here.

1606
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,480
I can't trust the rope.

1607
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
(I can trust our staff but not that imported rope.)

1608
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,980
Gosh, why did I have to be born like this?

1609
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,220
Oh my gosh.

1610
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,380
I am too terrified.

1611
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,680
I'm serious.

1612
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,850
(Seok Jin gives up.)

1613
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,380
(Kwang Soo joins the zipline mission.)

1614
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,380
Oh, gosh. Wait.

1615
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,080
(He came after finishing the mission at JBR Beach.)

1616
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,150
(He's stiff.)

1617
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,680
All right.

1618
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,780
- Oh, okay.
 - Sit down.

1619
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,880
Oh, gosh.

1620
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,280
(His voice goes up.)

1621
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,480
He's about to ride it.

1622
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,480
(He's scared.)

1623
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,720
Come on.

1624
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,380
- There goes Kwang Soo.
 - Hold on.

1625
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,150
I'm going to fall.

1626
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,050
Gosh.

1627
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:01,070
(The producer gives him the mission.)

1628
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,920
(Why does it have to be at this moment?)

1629
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,480
Jumeirah Beach. Jumeirah Mosque.

1630
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,480
- Palm Jumeirah.
 - Shut up!

1631
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,180
Get lost!

1632
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,550
(Kwang Soo is upset.)

1633
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,380
- Are you ready?
 - Go!

1634
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,780
(He's taking off in five seconds.)

1635
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,080
- You will leave in five seconds.
 - Gosh.

1636
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,980
- Seriously!
 - He's gone pale.

1637
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,850
- No!
 - Go!

1638
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,850
- No!
 - Go!

1639
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,850
(He's like an unidentified flying object.)

1640
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:35,950
(He's thrilled!)

1641
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,650
His hat dropped.

1642
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,020
(He's more shocked that he lost his hat.)

1643
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,280
(He breaks into tears.)

1644
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,750
(He doesn't want to let his hat go.)

1645
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,380
Someone is coming.

1646
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,650
Isn't it Kwang Soo?

1647
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,480
(It's Kwang Soo.)

1648
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:02,380
(He returned from the terrifying zipline ride.)

1649
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,480
Kwang Soo.

1650
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,780
(He's gone.)

1651
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,480
You look 10 years older now.

1652
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,780
(Why does he look more aged?)

1653
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,880
- I lost my hat.
 - Your hat?

1654
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,980
Kwang Soo, please tell us the answer.

1655
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,480
(He has to memorise the given words.)

1656
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,150
Jumeirah...

1657
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,280
(It's Jumeirah Beach, Jumeirah Mosque,)

1658
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,580
(Palm Jumeirah and Madinat Jumeirah Souk.)

1659
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,980
- You get five seconds.
 - Was it Jumeirah Saurus?

1660
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,480
(He gives a wrong answer.)

1661
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,780
Bing pong?

1662
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,630
How come your face is so pale?

1663
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,880
Incorrect.

1664
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,080
(He fails the mission.)

1665
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,870
- Well...
 - You failed the mission.

1666
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:41,700
No way!

1667
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,980
There must be a mission.

1668
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,880
Maybe we have to guess how many bridges we passed.

1669
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,380
(They continues clearing the missions as they travelled.)

1670
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,250
Good job, Ji Hyo!

1671
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,180
This is too difficult.

1672
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,750
- Hurry up!
 - You are close to getting it!

1673
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,950
- Okay!
 - Good job!

1674
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,580
(They only have 30 minutes left.)

1675
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,580
(Ji Hyo and Gary are on the lead so far.)

1676
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,280
(Finally, they are ready to take off for the sky diving.)

1677
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,080
See you!

1678
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,220
We'll get going!

1679
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,580
- We will come back alive.
 - We will be back alive.

1680
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,980
(We will be back alive.)

1681
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,950
(They have 30 minutes left until the end of their given time.)

1682
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,560
You jump first.

1683
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,150
No, I will jump last.

1684
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,580
Please jump first.

1685
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,060
You want me to jump first? It's really okay with me.

1686
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,380
- It's better to go first.
 - Let's go.

1687
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,480
You'll get more scared watching others go.

1688
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,780
(They start boarding on the one-way plane to the sky.)

1689
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:42,320
(She's terrified.)

1690
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,880
(He is totally ready to dominate the sky.)

1691
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,950
(Jong Kook's excited.)

1692
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,850
(They ride on a plane for the sky diving.)

1693
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,680
(How far have you been to experience Dubai?)

1694
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,380
(The aeroplane takes off.)

1695
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,180
(They go up with trained instructors.)

1696
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,880
(They are very excited.)

1697
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,850
(She's nervous.)

1698
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,280
I'm so nervous.

1699
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,480
Goodness!

1700
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,580
- I now feel it's real.
 - You do?

1701
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:51,850
Oh my gosh.

1702
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,580
- Are you okay?
 - Yes, I'm okay.

1703
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,580
- Take care of my friend, okay?
 - Okay.

1704
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,580
- You can do it.
 - Thank you.

1705
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,750
Anything else you want to say to the camera?

1706
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,580
Please, save me.

1707
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,480
Everyone,

1708
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,780
I am...

1709
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,280
(She's extremely nervous.)

1710
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,050
I am going to skydive in four minutes.

1711
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,280
Cheers!

1712
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,380
(You can do it!)

1713
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,680
(She screams.)

1714
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,680
All right, guys. Let's skydive! Let's go!

1715
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,850
(It's time to skydive!)

1716
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,720
(He's going to check if they've arrived at the right place.)

1717
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,480
(Green light)

1718
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,380
(The instructor thinks it's a perfect height to jump.)

1719
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,450
(He skydives.)

1720
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,280
Someone just made a jump!

1721
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,580
(The instructor skydives first for the best picture spot.)

1722
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,280
He opened the parachute.

1723
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,080
(Jong Kook is terrified.)

1724
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,580
(His instructor looks very relaxed.)

1725
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,350
(Why did I volunteer to do this?)

1726
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:13,250
(We get to see the nice view thanks to them.)

1727
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,080
(Finally, they reached the altitude of 3962.4m.)

1728
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,080
(It's time to go.)

1729
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,580
(He's nervous.)

1730
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:42,780
(Will Jong Kook be able to make a jump?)

1731
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,720
(Skydiving)

1732
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,380
(Jong Kook...)

1733
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,080
(successfully manages to dive in the sky.)

1734
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,380
(Jumping)

1735
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:57,080
(Successful skydive in Dubai)

1736
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:06,280
(Variety shows are tough these days.)

1737
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,380
(It's thrilling!)

1738
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:31,180
(He looks more like a muscular flying squirrel today.)

1739
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,920
(His parachute is released for the safety.)

1740
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:49,590
(It's the view taken from Jong Kook's camera.)

1741
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,180
(Next is Il Woo.)

1742
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:02,790
(Will he make a jump at once like a man?)

1743
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,050
(Of course!)

1744
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,850
(He looks so relaxed.)

1745
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:14,250
(Let's fly!)

1746
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:36,120
(He gives off his charms, flying at an altitude of 3962.4m.)

1747
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,350
(He also gives off his funny face.)

1748
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:47,350
(He grabs the cameraman.)

1749
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,780
(An actor never wants to lose his cameramen.)

1750
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:56,350
(It's time to release his parachute.)

1751
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,780
(Now, it's her turn to skydive.)

1752
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:10,220
(Will she be able to make a jump?)

1753
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:14,790
(Or will she give up here?)

1754
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,250
(Her heart is pounding.)

1755
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,520
(She jumps off.)

1756
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,880
(Da Hey did it!)

1757
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:41,980
(She jumped bravely without hesitation.)

1758
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:50,420
(There are a lot of actresses,)

1759
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,850
(but none like her.)

1760
01:10:53,850 --> 01:11:00,350
(She feels the infinite freedom after she overcomes her fear.)

1761
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,050
(Da Hey is excited.)

1762
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,880
(She's so relaxed that she even tries to make cute expressions.)

1763
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,850
(Her parachute is released.)

1764
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,780
(Brava!)

1765
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:41,050
(Jong Kook who jumped first is now visible from the land.)

1766
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:50,590
(It's the view taken from Jong Kook's camera.)

1767
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,550
(Nice landing)

1768
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:58,950
Welcome back, brother.

1769
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,080
(Welcome back, brother.)

1770
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,550
How was it?

1771
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,750
So awesome!

1772
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,220
- I can't say anything, man.
 - Was it fun?

1773
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,950
(He's totally satisfied.)

1774
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,720
Tell me anything about it.

1775
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,950
I am so happy.

1776
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,590
- Are you happy?
 - Yes.

1777
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,850
That's Il Woo.

1778
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:20,050
(The second skydiver Il Woo is about to land.)

1779
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,780
Welcome back to the ground!

1780
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:27,050
(He's back from the sky.)

1781
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,450
Good job!

1782
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:29,980
Did you have fun?

1783
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,780
Now, you can take your goggles out.

1784
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,150
(He's still excited.)

1785
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,250
Where is the best place to have a skydiving?

1786
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,450
- Good job.
 - Did you have fun?

1787
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:42,450
Now, you can take your goggles out.

1788
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,480
(Da Hey nailed it. She's coming down, too.)

1789
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:52,180
(It's the view taken from Da Hey's camera.)

1790
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,750
Oh my goodness.

1791
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:58,650
(An angel is descending from the sky.)

1792
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,790
(She's screaming.)

1793
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,620
(Perfect landing)

1794
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,080
Give me a high five.

1795
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,150
(They're celebrating their success, too.)

1796
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,750
You were scared but you stay alive.

1797
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,980
- Here you are at the ground.
 - Yes, I'm alive.

1798
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,090
Yes, I'm alive. I'm still alive.

1799
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,730
- Beautiful! It was great.
 - How was the view?

1800
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,740
It was amazing. I loved it.

1801
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,220
I must give it a shot again.

1802
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,620
(I must give it a shot again.)

1803
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,580
The world I've seen above was...

1804
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:28,250
like a utopia. It was wonderful.

1805
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,920
Mission complete!

1806
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,850
(Mission complete!)

1807
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,620
Mission completed!

1808
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:41,150
(All of the three cleared their mission.)

1809
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,220
This feeling is indescribable.

1810
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,790
It was so crazy.

1811
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,850
(He won't forget about this feeling.)

1812
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,020
Wow, this is amazing.

1813
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,220
- This is incredible.
 - Really.

1814
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,950
- We must do it in Dubai.
 - This is crazy.

1815
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:57,680
You must try this at least once...

1816
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,830
- in your life.
 - In your life.

1817
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:02,720
- I am alive.
 - It was amazing.

1818
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,580
This is...

1819
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,850
(These brave three cleared the hardest mission perfectly.)

1820
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:10,450
It can't be compared to bungee jumping.

1821
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,850
- I feel like...
 - I should've tried it earlier.

1822
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,320
- It's a must in your life.
 - Right, this is a must in life.

1823
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,460
- It wasn't that scary.
 - Everyone should try this.

1824
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,320
- These are for you.
 - Right.

1825
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,980
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

1826
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,580
(They get to sleep at an exclusive hotel in Dubai.)

1827
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,850
Thank you.

1828
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,350
I feel like I won an award.

1829
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,350
Thank you.

1830
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:35,320
(The individual travelling is over.)

1831
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,050
We all nailed it.

1832
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,850
- Da Hey, you're very brave.
 - Right.

1833
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,250
(The game has just begun. What will be waiting for them?)

1834
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:49,150
(How many stamps did they get?)

1835
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,720
(All members gathered to go to the desert.)

1836
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,480
I need some rest now.

1837
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,680
(Let's head to the desert.)

1838
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,980
(Will they get a chance to make a reverse?)

1839
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,150
I wonder what we will do next.

1840
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,680
(Will they get a chance to make a reverse?)

1841
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:04,120
This is not my style, but...

1842
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,150
(Jae Seok spruces himself up with the sunglasses to go to the desert.)

1843
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:15,420
(After individual travelling, They are getting out of the downtown.)

1844
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,150
(I might have to sleep outside if I can't turn over the result.)

1845
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:28,350
(The automobiles are heading toward the desert in suburban area.)

1846
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:37,090
(The members become drowsy on their way to the desert.)

1847
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:43,720
(Kwang Soo is yawning very long.)

1848
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,650
(Now there's nothing but desert.)

1849
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:54,720
(Desert is vast, and the members are falling in sleep.)

1850
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:02,250
(You'd better take a nap when you can.)

1851
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:05,590
(They arrived at the intermediate station in the desert's entrance.)

1852
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,580
(Half asleep and half awake)

1853
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:16,150
(Why does he stop the car here?)

1854
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,790
(What are they doing?)

1855
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:32,680
(The drivers are deflating the tires all of a sudden.)

1856
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,100
(Why are they deflating the tires?)

1857
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,150
(You'll see why soon.)

1858
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,150
Fasten your seat belt.

1859
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:47,220
(We're moving into the middle of the desert now.)

1860
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,220
- Is everybody ready?
 - Yes, I'm ready.

1861
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,850
(They're ready.)

1862
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,150
Let's go.

1863
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,850
(Da Hey is pretty excited.)

1864
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,320
(The main game has just begun. Let's go to the desert!)

1865
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,550
- Is air conditioning okay?
 - Yes.

1866
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:06,520
(Sure)

1867
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,680
- Are you ready?
 - Yes.

1868
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,540
Let's go!

1869
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,680
(He's grinning.)

1870
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,950
(What will be waiting for us in the desert?)

1871
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:20,720
This is the real desert. This is real.

1872
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,090
There's really nothing out there but sand.

1873
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:32,220
(Welcome to the desert. You've never been desert before, right?)

1874
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:38,480
(There are only the four vehicles and sand winds in the desert.)

1875
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,360
I see nothing out there.

1876
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,840
You'll never find a way out if you get lost here.

1877
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,370
Right.

1878
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,590
That's true.

1879
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,720
- This desert is endless.
 - And nobody's here.

1880
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,750
We won't be able to find a way out if we get lost.

1881
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,550
(There's neither ways nor directions in this huge sand field.)

1882
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,050
And we sleep here tonight?

1883
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,720
(Kwang Soo is nervous.)

1884
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,850
- This is the real desert.
 - This is what we call desert.

1885
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,480
- Gosh.
 - We're right in the middle.

1886
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,350
I've never been to place like this before.

1887
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,150
- Look at that.
 - Okay.

1888
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,520
Wow!

1889
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,120
I've never seen such animal before.

1890
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,320
- My goodness.
 - It's amazing.

1891
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,680
(Antelope is similar to deer and inhabits in Africa and the Mideast.)

1892
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,550
They look great.

1893
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,150
They look fabulous.

1894
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:33,680
- They are like impalas.
 - That's what I thought.

1895
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,220
They will run away if we chase after them.

1896
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,720
(They might run away if we chase after them.)

1897
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:40,250
(It's bumpy.)

1898
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,080
(It's getting bumpier as they go toward the centre of the desert.)

1899
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,090
- It's not dangerous. Relax.
 - Wait.

1900
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,050
(Are we riding a roller coaster?)

1901
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,520
Goodness.

1902
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:57,720
- It's about to overturn.
 - Gosh.

1903
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,290
- My goodness.
 - Oh, dear.

1904
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:01,450
It's almost overturned.

1905
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,650
Is he heading to the cliff?

1906
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,620
- Are you serious?
 - Gosh!

1907
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:12,480
(Drivers deflate tires to lessen impact in rough and bumpy deserts.)

1908
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,090
(They automatically hold on to the handle.)

1909
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,590
- Gosh, look at that.
 - Stop!

1910
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:22,680
(I just got back from the zipline.)

1911
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,020
This is insane.

1912
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,320
(We just came back from skydiving.)

1913
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,250
(He doesn't even have a handle.)

1914
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,920
I don't even have a handle.

1915
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,480
Someone broke it.

1916
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,550
- Do you have one?
 - No, we don't.

1917
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,360
It's broken.

1918
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,480
Oh, gosh!

1919
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,580
The car will flip.

1920
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,080
Look out!

1921
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,680
(Kwang Soo is freaking out.)

1922
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,020
Wait, not that way.

1923
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,580
It's dangerous.

1924
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,980
It's really dangerous.

1925
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,220
Gosh.

1926
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,480
(What a scaredy-cat!)

1927
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,480
It became almost a right angle.

1928
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,720
- So this is Dubai.
 - Now, I feel like I'm in Dubai.

1929
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,270
(Gosh!)

1930
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:09,980
(How far are we going?)

1931
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,420
(He misses his mum.)

1932
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,480
We'll have an accident.

1933
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,920
Look at this.

1934
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,680
(Screaming the whole way)

1935
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,920
- Oh, no.
 - Kwang Soo.

1936
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,380
(Driving through the golden sands)

1937
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:32,680
(They finally arrive at their destination.)

1938
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,780
(Wow!)

1939
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,090
- Wow.
 - This is amazing.

1940
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:47,380
(They're amazed by the golden sunset and endless desert.)

1941
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,550
Don't tell me we are sleeping here.

1942
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:52,160
Seok Jin, why don't you start putting up a tent?

1943
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,380
(Seok Jin got only three stamps.)

1944
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,920
You should get more time to sleep.

1945
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,380
You're no better than me.

1946
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,120
- I have six.
 - There's no big difference.

1947
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,790
Kwang Soo also got only three stamps.

1948
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,580
You two should start putting up tents.

1949
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,820
No, it's too early to give up.

1950
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,360
You will be playing three rounds of this game.

1951
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,480
The winner will get three stamps.

1952
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,920
- I should win.
 - Wow.

1953
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,680
You can win up to nine stamps.

1954
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,080
- So there's still a chance.
 - All right.

1955
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,180
Those who skydived are sleeping at the hotel, right?

1956
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,880
You can just sit back and relax.

1957
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,550
They will be sitting back and enjoying the game.

1958
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:28,480
The rule is simple. We'll get ready.

1959
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,090
(Who will be able to reverse the situation?)

1960
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,680
(The last game for the stamps is "Shoes Race")

1961
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,280
You will first run toward the boxes over there.

1962
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,790
You'll choose one among them and open it.

1963
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,980
And then?

1964
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,380
In the boxes are various kinds of shoes which you'll have to wear.

1965
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,550
Whoever takes the flag first with the shoes on will be the winner.

1966
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:51,480
(If you win all 3 rounds, you'll get 9 stamps.)

1967
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,950
It feels so nice to walk on the sands.

1968
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:57,570
Then why don't you sleep in the sands tonight?

1969
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,980
- Are you kidding me?
 - That's a good idea.

1970
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,790
- Are you ready?
 - Yes.

1971
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,380
Which shoes you choose matters the most.

1972
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,980
You're right. It's random.

1973
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,580
You have to be wearing the shoes when you pull out the flag.

1974
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,290
Leave me alone.

1975
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,180
- This is so annoying.
 - What's wrong?

1976
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,020
- I'll just sleep here.
 - Where are you going?

1977
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,020
- This is annoying.
 - Fine.

1978
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,120
- They're trying so hard to stop me.
 - Just do it.

1979
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,180
- Let's just do it.
 - Just do it.

1980
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,550
- Let's start.
 - Don't do it from the beginning.

1981
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,180
- Ready.
 - Don't take away others.

1982
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,590
Ready.

1983
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,550
(Oops)

1984
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,290
They're so desperate.

1985
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,480
- Gosh.
 - Didn't you say you give up?

1986
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,590
- I should at least try it.
 - He's desperate.

1987
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,380
- Seok Jin, step back.
 - Okay.

1988
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,920
Ready, go.

1989
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,590
(Start)

1990
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,590
(Racing)

1991
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,790
Gary is fast.

1992
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,880
(Gary opens a box first.)

1993
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,680
(It's slippers)

1994
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:52,090
What are these?

1995
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:53,980
(Toe socks)

1996
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,350
How do I put them on?

1997
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,680
(Ji Hyo got flippers.)

1998
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,380
(Kwang Soo got straw shoes.)

1999
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:03,570
(Toe socks, slippers, straw shoes, high heels, sandals and flippers)

2000
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:05,090
What are these?

2001
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,160
How do I put them on?

2002
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,380
(Struggling)

2003
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,480
Wait.

2004
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,580
What are these?

2005
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:13,290
(Jae Seok seemed not interested, but he's the fastest to wear heels.)

2006
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,720
(Run!)

2007
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,480
(Jae Seok rushes forward.)

2008
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,820
(Jae Seok is on the lead.)

2009
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,320
(Pulling out the flag)

2010
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,920
No!

2011
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,380
(Jae Seok wins the round and gets three stamps.)

2012
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:28,120
- I had to wear flippers.
 - I chose a good one.

2013
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,170
- What is Jae Seok wearing?
 - Nice!

2014
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,480
- Look at you.
 - That's amazing.

2015
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,180
You should've prepared bigger ones.

2016
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,980
- It's too small for me.
 - Look at him!

2017
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,550
- You ran so hard.
 - Let's go for another round.

2018
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,420
I just need to win one more time.

2019
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:44,120
- Why do you run so hard?
 - You said you'd give up.

2020
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,580
No, I never said that.

2021
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:48,880
- Look at Jae Seok.
 - I could've won.

2022
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:52,580
Come here, Kwang Soo. We're sleeping out in the desert.

2023
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,880
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are sleeping out in the desert tonight.)

2024
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,250
- Let's just do it.
 - It's pure luck.

2025
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,580
It's okay to sleep here.

2026
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,120
- It's no big deal.
 - Have you ever slept in a desert?

2027
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,980
When will we sleep in a desert again?

2028
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,280
Ready.

2029
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,580
Hurry!

2030
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,120
Look how focused Jae Seok is.

2031
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,480
Jae Seok is really into this game.

2032
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,680
Ready.

2033
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,960
(I'll win again...)

2034
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,700
(and sleep at the hotel tonight.)

2035
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,560
(I want to sleep at the hotel, too.)

2036
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,480
(I have to win two rounds to sleep at the hotel.)

2037
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,320
(Racing)

2038
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,290
- They're fast.
 - Gary is fast.

2039
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:28,800
He's fast.

2040
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,480
(It's time to choose a box.)

2041
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,290
What is this?

2042
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:34,090
(Gary chose slippers again.)

2043
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,980
(Ji Hyo chose high heels.)

2044
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,980
- Gary is fast.
 - What is this?

2045
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,090
(Haha chose sandals.)

2046
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,020
(Jae Seok chose toe socks.)

2047
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,590
He's fast.

2048
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,820
(Jae Seok falls behind.)

2049
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,590
- What is this?
 - He got socks.

2050
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,920
(Haha's shoes came off.)

2051
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,180
Wait.

2052
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,880
(Now, it's a competition between Monday Couple.)

2053
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,420
(I don't mind sleeping in a desert.)

2054
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,320
(Are you sure you want to compete with me?)

2055
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,090
(They are against each other.)

2056
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:09,590
Ji Hyo.

2057
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,220
(What?)

2058
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,480
(Flying)

2059
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,780
(He flew to the flag.)

2060
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,980
(What did I just see?)

2061
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,680
Ji Hyo.

2062
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,480
(Gary wins the round.)

2063
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,680
(She's upset.)

2064
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,120
He's mean.

2065
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,480
- That was so mean.
 - That's not gentle.

2066
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,320
(He's such a jerk.)

2067
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,790
(He used to be so nice to her.)

2068
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,180
(Is he really the same person?)

2069
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,880
- It's pretty, isn't it?
 - It's as pretty as you.

2070
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,580
(Sorry, I'm allergic to sand.)

2071
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,320
- That was so mean.
 - That's not gentle.

2072
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,880
(He's so happy to win the round.)

2073
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,580
- Are you happy?
 - Shame on you.

2074
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,290
- He swung himself.
 - Monday Couple is about to break.

2075
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:02,190
I was too focused on the game.

2076
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,720
Why did it have to be Ji Hyo?

2077
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,920
(Forget it.)

2078
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,020
(I have sand in my mouth.)

2079
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,380
Seriously.

2080
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:12,480
(How could you do that to me?)

2081
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,290
(Punishing)

2082
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:16,090
How could you slide like that?

2083
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:19,580
You threw yourself to get the flag.

2084
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,880
I...

2085
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,320
I couldn't help it.

2086
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,480
(They only got annoyed and upset by playing the race.)

2087
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,580
Gary goes to the hotel.

2088
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,920
I'm embarrassed.

2089
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,020
(Gary gets to sleep at the hotel.)

2090
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,020
We'll never forget your sliding.

2091
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:36,790
He completely threw himself.

2092
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:38,680
In addition to that,

2093
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,590
when he threw himself,

2094
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:43,480
I got all the sand in my face.

2095
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,020
(He's sorry.)

2096
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,580
Jong Kook gets to sleep at the hotel.

2097
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,980
- Thank you.
 - Da Hey, too.

2098
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:50,580
Il Woo gets to sleep at the hotel.

2099
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,290
- I'm so happy.
 - Ji Hyo, too.

2100
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,790
- It's no big deal.
 - Do you have any objection?

2101
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:56,290
- No.
 - The result is so obvious.

2102
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:59,120
It turned out exactly how we predicted.

2103
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,590
- What did I tell you?
 - Our prediction...

2104
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:02,920
turned out to be exactly correct.

2105
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,790
It's the same members in Taiwan special.

2106
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,580
It's the exactly same members.

2107
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,980
You're right.

2108
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,680
We went on a rollercoaster ride together.

2109
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,350
Okay, those who sleep at the hotel...

2110
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,970
will now head to the hotel.

2111
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:17,380
- Now?
 - Already?

2112
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,980
- Really?
 - It's unbelievable.

2113
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,180
All right.

2114
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:22,280
- To the hotel?
 - Are we leaving them behind?

2115
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,480
Yes. Leave them behind.

2116
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,380
- Gosh.
 - Okay.

2117
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,120
Won't you get sick tomorrow?

2118
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,120
- We will.
 - We sure will.

2119
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,370
We might even get into a fight.

2120
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,780
The four of us.

2121
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,480
Four of us might end up being three.

2122
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,820
Exactly.

2123
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,690
Wait and see what happens.

2124
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,920
- I feel bad.
 - It's okay. You can go.

2125
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,180
Don't worry. You can go.

2126
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,280
(They should head to the hotel now.)

2127
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,580
(It's time to say goodbye.)

2128
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:45,680
I feel so bad.

2129
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,580
- Is Il Woo staying?
 - Go.

2130
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,480
I know how you feel, but you should go.

2131
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,120
(They're going back to the civilised world.)

2132
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,680
- Good night.
 - See you.

2133
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,550
Bring some breakfast for us.

2134
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,080
You should bring us some food.

2135
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,550
- See you.
 - Have some chocolate.

2136
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:00,320
(The survival starts.)

2137
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:03,420
- Give it to me!
 - Let go!

2138
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,580
Go away.

2139
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,880
- I haven't eaten all day!
 - Give me some, too!

2140
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,680
(They have...)

2141
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,680
(completely adapted...)

2142
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,580
(to the wild.)

2143
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,780
(Let's go back to the civilised world.)

2144
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:18,220
See you.

2145
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:23,480
(The chocolate is mine.)

2146
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,080
- Get him!
 - Get him!

2147
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,120
No!

2148
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,220
- See you.
 - Bye!

2149
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,220
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo and Haha will sleep out at the desert.)

2150
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,120
I even brought my swimming pants. I thought I'd stay at a hotel.

2151
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,580
Wait.

2152
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,980
Make sure...

2153
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,270
you don't stray far.

2154
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,580
You might die.

2155
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,020
- What?
 - What are you saying?

2156
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,580
- Why do you say something so scary?
 - Seriously.

2157
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:49,980
Listen to me.

2158
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,420
- What are you talking about?
 - Wait.

2159
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,480
Have you ever been in a situation like this?

2160
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,480
- You might die.
 - There might be animals.

2161
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
Will there be snakes?

2162
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,580
- What about desert foxes?
 - Not snakes.

2163
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,920
What is it called? The ones with the unique tail.

2164
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,370
That's a kind of snakes.

2165
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,680
But that kind is only found in North America.

2166
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,780
- You're an expert.
 - He knows a lot!

2167
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,950
- I told you.
 - He's like someone from...

2168
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:13,150
the "Discovery Channel".

2169
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,950
I'm an expert at survival tactics.

2170
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:19,180
You should know that in extreme situations,

2171
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,980
not all four of us can survive.

2172
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,480
- We need to abandon one.
 - We should kill one.

2173
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,750
(The survival expert is bringing up the biggest risk factor.)

2174
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,680
- I'm not kidding.
 - What have we done so wrong today?

2175
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,280
Let's abandon him.

2176
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,150
- He doesn't do anything anyway.
 - He must be useful in some ways.

2177
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,380
It was just an example.

2178
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,080
I was saying it so we're determined to stick together until the end.

2179
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,680
- All together.
 - Let's not give up.

2180
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,950
- All right.
 - Let's not betray each other, okay?

2181
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,580
- In 1, 2 and 3. Let's go.
 - Let's go!

2182
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,280
(Good luck with sleeping outside!)

2183
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,420
(Will they really not betray each other?)

2184
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:07,910
(After driving quite a distance,)

2185
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:10,510
(they arrived at the hotel in the middle of the desert.)

2186
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,510
- That's really a good thing.
 - You see?

2187
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,000
I thought about it on the way here.

2188
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,010
Although I didn't win a lot,

2189
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,610
I always manage to avoid the worst.

2190
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,510
- Is this it?
 - Thank you.

2191
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,710
Thank you.

2192
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:27,910
This must be the hotel.

2193
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:30,010
(In the middle of the desert)

2194
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,310
- Oh my goodness.
 - Really?

2195
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:32,780
(The finest hotel is located right next to the desert.)

2196
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,610
If you just open the door, you can see the desert.

2197
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:35,710
(If you just open the door, you can see desert.)

2198
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,710
- It's right next to the bedroom.
 - Gosh!

2199
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:39,280
This is too luxurious.

2200
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:43,010
This is a feast we've prepared for you.

2201
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,670
- Please enjoy it comfortably.
 - Wow.

2202
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:47,300
A feast for us?

2203
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,510
- Is this a buffet?
 - Come and take...

2204
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,810
a glass of water for each of you.

2205
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:52,410
We'll enjoy the food as we settle down.

2206
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:54,150
Is it really a buffet?

2207
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:57,010
- Look at this.
 - It looks so pretty.

2208
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,410
What is this? It's like steamed eggs.

2209
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,610
I want to take some to them.

2210
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:04,010
Yes, I want to take some to my mother.

2211
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,880
(He's a good son.)

2212
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,410
(It all looks tasty.)

2213
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:11,480
It looks enough to serve eight couples.

2214
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,200
- I think I was too greedy.
 - How is it?

2215
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,390
- It tastes good.
 - This is tasty.

2216
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,450
- I didn't expect it to be.
 - It's so delicious.

2217
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,110
So out there is the desert?

2218
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,310
- That's right.
 - I see.

2219
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:30,350
I should check that out after dinner.

2220
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,100
This place is very romantic.

2221
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,710
It's a great place for couples.

2222
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:37,610
I feel like I'm an outsider between two couples.

2223
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,510
(What is he saying?)

2224
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:42,210
Don't say that.

2225
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:45,810
(They enjoyed their wonderful dinner at the hotel.)

2226
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,010
Let's take a picture to remember this night.

2227
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,080
Okay.

2228
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,300
- This camera turns 360-degrees.
 - Okay.

2229
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,410
- All the staff will be in it.
 - Okay.

2230
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,510
In 1, 2 and 3.

2231
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,280
(Click)

2232
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,910
- That was short.
 - Yes.

2233
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:03,810
- It still captured everything.
 - Really?

2234
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:06,180
(Spinning around)

2235
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,510
Look here.

2236
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:09,810
(They can't take their eyes of the photo.)

2237
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,350
- I think I'll have some more.
 - You can even zoom in.

2238
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:14,110
You can see me.

2239
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,080
It's really all in that photo.

2240
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,610
You can also do this to see just the sky.

2241
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:25,810
(Tonight,)

2242
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:29,310
(the songs of the shooting stars...)

2243
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:33,400
(awaken the myth kept in the desert.)

2244
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:37,410
(They have to follow the only light to raise...)

2245
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:43,210
(Golden Grasshopper which has been asleep...)

2246
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:46,210
(across 1,000 years.)

2247
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:47,900
The legend of Golden Grasshopper.

2248
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:51,110
(Only then, they can escape from the place.)

2249
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:54,210
(Time leads straight to their lives.)

2250
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,910
My life depends on it.

2251
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:57,410
(Within the given period of time that sandglass allows,)

2252
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,510
(they have to find nine keys...)

2253
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:01,610
(and become the master of Gold Grasshopper.)

2254
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,210
(The new story in Dubai)

2255
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:08,910
