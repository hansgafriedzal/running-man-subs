1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,640
(Spring special! Running Man, "All About Them")

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,840
(Running Man members reveal their true faces after 6 years.)

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,610
- Hello.
 - Hello there.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,140
(Their true selves will be unveiled.)

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,040
Jae Seok is a good person, but...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,810
(And shocking truths about them continue to be revealed.)

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,610
(Is Yu Jae Seok truly a decent man?)

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,940
I am getting upset too.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,340
If he had the fighting skills, he would've been more evil than me.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,240
He would have. Yes.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,340
Would you have accepted my love if I had confessed my feelings?

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,410
What?

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,680
- Ji Hyo.
 - Ji Hyo dolled up for Gary!

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,440
(They will go on a real date and confirm each other's feelings.)

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,540
- Let's stay like this.
 - I think I have butterflies.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,780
- It's nice.
 - They're sweet.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,840
Because it was officially a date, I got a little bit nervous, but...

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,240
(They will get a scientific approval of their feelings.)

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,140
Check Gary's brain reaction when he sees Ji Hyo's picture.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,440
You will see that there is a heart shape in the middle of his brain.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,140
- What?
 - Really?

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,610
- There is a heart?
 - So does Ji Hyo really like him?

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,030
Goodness.

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,580
Hello!

25
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,310
(Running Man, your best choice for Sunday afternoons)

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,540
The director who had been...

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,310
- leading Running Man...
 - Leading...

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,480
resigned as of last week.

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,250
- And we got a new director.
 - The director has changed.

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,140
So for a new change...

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,440
- Hey.
 - Yes?

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,710
Let's use this as an opportunity to bring in Joong Ki.

33
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,940
- What are you talking about?
 - He's very popular these days.

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,240
- You never wanted him before.
 - Call Joong Ki.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,940
Can't he join us once every two weeks?

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,440
I am sorry, but...

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,540
who doesn't want him here?

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,580
- We know how great he is.
 - So let's tell him and...

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,740
It's been three years since you last mentioned his name.

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,840
- I know.
 - Hey.

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,340
- You never cared for him.
 - One person is getting sick here.

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,740
We feel really bad too.

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,780
- He got anger management issues.
 - Right.

44
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,630
- Joong Ki is...
 - I'm so jealous.

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,040
- Now...
 - He used to be the same.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,840
You can try to have a hot body.

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,810
But you will forever be below Joong Ki's feet.

48
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,040
What do you mean his "feet"?

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,510
- Why should I be below him?
 - You're rather like a sole pad.

50
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,140
- Don't say that. Kwang Soo...
 - You're like the sole pad.

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,580
is close to In Sung and Joong Ki.

52
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,710
We always tell him that he's just a butler.

53
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,940
- You're a butler.
 - That's too harsh.

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,939
It's the truth. Goodness.

55
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,010
- What are we doing today?
 - I'm curious too.

56
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,650
You will be communicating with some of our viewers.

57
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,740
- Have we not been doing so well?
 - I've seen the preview.

58
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,840
You would've seen it through SNS.

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,330
You will be satisfying the viewers' curiosities.

60
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,040
It's called "Running Man Q and A".

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,440
("All About Them")

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
(What?)

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,650
- Have the viewers asked questions?
 - Yes.

64
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,340
(Through various social networking sites,)

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,780
(we received a total of...)

66
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,040
(6,271 questions.)

67
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,780
(The third most popular question was if Ji Hyo was really pretty.)

68
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,640
(The second most popular question was if Ji Hyo and Gary are in love.)

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,110
(The most popular question was if Jae Seok is a decent man.)

70
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,680
We sorted the questions for each member.

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
"When will Ji Hyo and Gary shoot 'We Got Married'?"

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,340
- Yes.
 - "We Got Married".

73
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,410
"What are the chances of them becoming a real couple?"

74
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,140
- What do you think?
 - They are very interested in them.

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,320
The chances are lower than that of getting hit by a lightning.

76
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,710
It's like the chance of Kwang Soo catching up with Joong Ki.

77
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,680
Why would you compare to that?

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,340
We might have more chances than that.

79
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,410
- Are your chances better?
 - That can never happen.

80
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,340
We have at least a chance of one percent.

81
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,480
Several days ago, I went to Jong Kook's concert...

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,140
and went up on stage with Joong Ki.

83
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,240
- So?
 - Actually, I was a little worried.

84
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,210
I called them out on stage, but...

85
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,640
I know that Kwang Soo is quite popular.

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,340
- Kwang Soo's very popular too.
 - So I was afraid he'd...

87
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,040
be better received than Joong Ki.

88
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,140
That would make me feel sorry for Joong Ki.

89
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,940
- But I shouldn't have been worried.
 - I am worried.

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,140
- He was like a normal person.
 - He didn't have to worry.

91
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,940
After introducing Joong Ki,

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,440
I introduced Kwang Soo, and he was treated normally.

93
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,210
Whenever I said something, people stopped laughing.

94
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,440
(Frozen)

95
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,110
And when Joong Ki started to speak again...

96
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,240
- But...
 - And for Joong Ki, they prepared...

97
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,140
- They prepared something nice.
 - a pretty box to cover his face.

98
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,810
- It was like Primary's.
 - Yes.

99
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,910
But they made me wear a black plastic bag.

100
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,340
Here we go.

101
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,840
(They gave the top star a special treatment.)

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,640
All right. Here we go.

103
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,140
Hello, everyone.

104
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,290
- Yes, I am a gentle person.
 - Yes.

105
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,240
- Should we walk forward?
 - Sure.

106
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,710
(Hot for Joong Ki, but cold for Kwang Soo)

107
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,410
(Kwang Soo was humiliated.)

108
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,340
Joong Ki is a man with a sense of loyalty.

109
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,840
- He's loyal.
 - What do you mean? I was there too!

110
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,610
This is the next question.

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,810
"If you could switch bodies with another member, who would it be?"

112
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,110
What about you, Kwang Soo?

113
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,810
(I don't really have anyone.)

114
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,950
- Who?
 - I want to be Ji Hyo.

115
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,440
Why?

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,910
He's a pervert.

117
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,340
- What?
 - Why aren't you answering?

118
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,950
- Why?
 - He's a sly man, isn't he?

119
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,840
- Ji Hyo is offended.
 - Where are you going?

120
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,340
- You...
 - It's not what you think.

121
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,710
- Hey!
 - It's not like that.

122
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,840
- Ji Hyo is upset.
 - What did I do wrong?

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,210
- Ji Hyo!
 - Ji Hyo's face is so funny.

124
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,710
- You're funny.
 - She's very offended.

125
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,450
- Why...
 - Tell us the reason then.

126
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,810
Explain yourself.

127
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,910
I don't want to.

128
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
(Only he knows the truth.)

129
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,540
Okay. Okay.

130
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,310
- I don't need to answer that.
 - He just said it for no reason.

131
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,840
- I want to be Jong Kook.
 - Why?

132
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I want to be Jong Kook, and eat instant noodles...

133
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,040
and burgers. I will destroy his body in just a month.

134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,831
I will make his chest sag all the way to the floor.

135
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:32,440
When you stop exercising all of a sudden, your muscles sag.

136
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,940
- Really.
 - Yes.

137
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,340
I'd like to become Jae Seok...

138
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,940
and curse everyone I see.

139
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,580
I'll spit everywhere too.

140
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,510
- And smoke like this.
 - And when kids come,

141
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,710
- I will say, "Get lost!"
 - "Get away from me!"

142
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,640
To the security guard, I will say, "What?"

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I want to be Jae Seok too. I will go clubbing all the time.

144
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,610
I will go clubbing and dance dirtily.

145
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,540
- And I'll grind on the girls.
 - Okay.

146
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
- I will get 100 girls' numbers.
 - Okay!

147
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,830
Do whatever you want with my body!

148
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,476
Use my body!

149
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,140
- How about you, Seok Jin?
 - I just like being myself.

150
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
No, no. The question is, "Who eats the most?"

151
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,410
(He's given a new question.)

152
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,640
Come on.

153
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,310
- It's a new question.
 - You didn't even tell me that.

154
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,240
- It's all about the flow.
 - You're right.

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,780
- The flow wasn't right.
 - There are too many questions.

156
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,040
- I need to keep it flowing.
 - We don't have time.

157
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,940
- I am so confused.
 - We don't have time for everything.

158
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,740
Now, we picked...

159
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,540
the most popular questions and the questions...

160
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,640
that need to be answered.

161
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,580
- Is that right?
 - That's amazing.

162
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,780
- Okay.
 - It's going to be fun.

163
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,840
- This is...
 - Really.

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,240
(We'll begin now.)

165
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,810
- I'm nervous.
 - Let's enjoy it, Ji Hyo.

166
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,840
Do you want to see what normal couples do?

167
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,940
(If they really went on a date,)

168
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,353
I think he would feel the same as I do.

169
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,140
(will they realise their true feelings?)

170
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,940
Through MRI scans, we will check their real feelings.

171
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,240
There have been many studies. You will see that...

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,340
there is a heart shape in the middle of their brains.

173
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,740
(We will not reveal their true feelings!)

174
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,940
Today, we will be communicating with our viewers.

175
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,480
That is what today will be about.

176
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,940
They might hope to see us acting lively as usual...

177
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,240
Should we show them?

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,140
- Where?
 - How can we show them here?

179
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,710
So will you two fight?

180
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,840
Yes. Let's have a one-on-one match here and show them.

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,580
- Rip my clothes, but not my flesh.
 - We can go there.

182
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,040
- Okay? Don't rip my flesh.
 - Of course.

183
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,540
Give it time to heal.

184
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,440
Seriously. Here we have...

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,710
- some questions.
 - Let's see some.

186
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,340
No way.

187
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,640
(What is the truth behind Ji Hyo and Gary?)

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,810
- I am very curious.
 - I want to know as well.

189
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,230
- What is the truth?
 - We are curious too.

190
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,910
- We are really curious.
 - I want to know too.

191
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,240
- Actually...
 - We don't know either.

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,340
Let's sort this out.

193
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,680
- We're so curious.
 - Just say yes or no.

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
Right. Tell us now.

195
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,680
- I am so curious.
 - I want to know the answer.

196
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
- That's right.
 - We're also curious.

197
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,140
Can I be honest about my feelings towards you?

198
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,040
These two agreed to be a couple on Mondays.

199
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,580
- Right.
 - They're the Monday Couple.

200
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,340
- That's good news.
 - Yes, so the two...

201
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,140
- It's Monday, so...
 - On Mondays, Gary is mine.

202
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,140
If I had asked you out then, would you have said yes?

203
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,240
(Will "All About That Couple" give us answers?)

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,940
I want you, Kang Gary!

205
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,540
- What are you doing?
 - Hey, Ji Hyo.

206
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,810
(Their actions have confused the viewers numerous times.)

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,580
(They are the most skilled at playing with the viewers' hearts.)

208
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,340
Ji Hyo.

209
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,340
- Is this all real?
 - I'm curious too.

210
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,240
- We don't know either.
 - Frankly, we don't know.

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,340
We think that...

212
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,940
since six years have passed...

213
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,510
- Let's get the facts straight.
 - I need it too.

214
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,140
- Tell us if it's true or not.
 - Yes, you can tell us now.

215
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,580
- I just want to ask one question.
 - They're confused too.

216
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,740
When you're shooting this programme, you must feel a certain emotion.

217
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,940
Have you ever developed a particular feeling for each other?

218
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,050
- Did you feel anything?
 - Yes, that's right.

219
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,680
- Sincerely.
 - Not as a colleague.

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,140
- Sincerely.
 - Even the slightest emotions.

221
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,940
- Should they say at the same time?
 - Actually,

222
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,710
- we're playing a certain role.
 - Answer yes or no.

223
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,240
- Answer yes or no.
 - One, two... Yes or no.

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,740
In 1, 2 and 3.

225
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,740
(How will they answer?)

226
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,910
(The investigation will begin.)

227
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,456
It's Gary's house.

228
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:05,350
I'm told to go on a date all of a sudden.

229
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,240
It's been so long since I've gone on one. I don't know where to go.

230
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,467
Since it's nearly dinner time...

231
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,940
Is he looking up places to go?

232
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,340
- He must be excited.
 - I made a reservation.

233
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,940
- Really?
 - I should look things up.

234
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,240
- He's great.
 - Don't you go where you usually go?

235
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,080
I think the chef's name was Choi Hyun Seok.

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,780
I think he has a restaurant somewhere.

237
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,910
(Luxurious first date)

238
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,210
If we go to a famous chef's restaurant,

239
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm sure women will really enjoy their time there...

240
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,566
But is this all really necessary just for Ji Hyo?

241
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,780
- He seems a bit haughty.
 - I'd like to make a reservation.

242
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,640
He's wondering if this is necessary.

243
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,940
- It's his charm.
 - Is six o'clock all right?

244
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,340
He is truly charming.

245
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,934
Okay, then we'll be there by six. Thank you.

246
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,050
- He prepared a lot.
 - I know.

247
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,880
I've never made reservations like this ever in my life.

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Women might find that attractive.

249
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,566
Is that his dressing room?

250
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,780
I should change.

251
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,050
- Goodness.
 - Amazing.

252
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,240
- Oh, my.
 - He's definitely a star.

253
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,340
He's a star.

254
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,140
It looks like a celebrity's house.

255
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,510
Gary is a celebrity, indeed.

256
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,680
- I can't show my house now.
 - Look at his hats.

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,010
My room can't be compared to that.

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,580
- Look at his clothes.
 - When did he buy that many?

259
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,050
- Which one...
 - Why do you have so many?

260
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,440
- There so much clothes.
 - There are only toys in my house.

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,780
(His biggest worry is choosing what to wear.)

262
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,140
Which one...

263
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,730
Did you wear a hat or style your hair?

264
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,340
Will it be cold?

265
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,580
I didn't wear a cap but a fedora.

266
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,740
I only wear this watch twice a year.

267
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,440
(He wears a luxurious watch on his wrist.)

268
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,840
I'll cut the meat like this.

269
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,480
He wears that watch only three times a year.

270
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,540
Isn't this Dok2's house?

271
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,140
Did he sponsor you his house?

272
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,740
Because of this date...

273
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,440
(He puts on a golden necklace.)

274
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,140
Oh, my.

275
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,840
(Embarrassed)

276
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,580
Did I really need to wear all that just because of her?

277
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,510
- I know you like it.
 - Who does she think she is?

278
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,240
Who does she think she is?

279
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,410
I need to act macho once.

280
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,580
It suits you.

281
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,140
You look like a little gentleman.

282
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,580
(Ji Hyo, I'm on my way.)

283
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,240
- Ji Hyo.
 - He looks handsome.

284
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,376
- He looks great.
 - I know how anxious he'd feel.

285
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,540
- It's a beauty parlour.
 - It's a salon.

286
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,680
- It's Ji Hyo's salon.
 - It's Ji Hyo's.

287
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
Ji Hyo, did you put makeup on for Gary?

288
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,740
(Embarrassed)

289
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,940
- Hey, you.
 - You put makeup on for Gary.

290
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,780
- She's preparing to flirt with him.
 - She is.

291
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,340
- You are quite something.
 - Oh, my.

292
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,680
- She looks girly.
 - She wants to impress him.

293
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,940
Really.

294
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
- What is she wearing?
 - She wants to knock him out.

295
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,440
Does Ji Hyo wear those styles?

296
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,610
I'm looking more like a girl now.

297
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,040
You know, she looks fit to be a bride.

298
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,340
Really.

299
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,780
- It's my first time wearing that.
 - You rarely wear makeup...

300
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,240
But...

301
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,376
do people usually dress up like this for a date?

302
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,580
Of course.

303
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,380
Actually, this is ordinary.

304
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,203
Is that so?

305
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:09,580
Is this normal?

306
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,090
It's quite...

307
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,840
embarrassing to dress up like this and meeting...

308
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
Gary alone.

309
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,456
(Shy)

310
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,940
I think I'm nervous.

311
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,240
Are you nervous?

312
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,810
I must be.

313
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,940
Did you say that you're nervous?

314
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,040
- Did you say you were nervous?
 - I heard her.

315
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,440
- Oh, my.
 - But...

316
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,240
I want to see them on a date.

317
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,140
A woman needs to wear make-up.

318
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,240
(She realises this.)

319
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
- This is the main part.
 - It's what the viewers want to see.

320
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,140
- They're curious.
 - This is the main part.

321
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,710
- Really.
 - It's making me nervous.

322
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,410
- Oh, my.
 - My goodness.

323
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,040
Men are a bit...

324
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,980
(Dazzling)

325
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,840
- Oh, my.
 - She put on make-up for Gary.

326
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
- She's preparing to flirt.
 - She is, indeed.

327
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,680
- It's possible.
 - She looks pretty.

328
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,710
- It looks like a photo-shoot.
 - Thank you.

329
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,080
Isn't it too unfair for Gary?

330
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,240
That's why I put on my accessories.

331
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,680
(She's about to meet him.)

332
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,340
- Oh, my.
 - My goodness.

333
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,110
Ji Hyo. You really look like a bride.

334
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,820
Should I walk like a girl?

335
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,680
- Of course.
 - No.

336
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
I like her style.

337
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,840
- She even has a handbag.
 - Yes.

338
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,466
What is it?

339
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:36,440
(It's the 6-year-old Monday Couple's first date ever.)

340
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,440
(What will their first greeting be?)

341
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,740
- Gary.
 - We're wearing matching hats.

342
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,040
It's so awkward!

343
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,310
(Beware of the awkwardness.)

344
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,737
It's exciting.

345
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,920
It's making me embarrassed.

346
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,340
We're wearing matching hats. Gary.

347
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,580
- I don't usually do this.
 - Don't...

348
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,140
do this.

349
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,680
- I've never done this before.
 - This doesn't suit me.

350
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,380
- I'm wearing make-up today.
 - It's so embarrassing.

351
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,880
- Fine.
 - Watch your head.

352
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,640
(He shows his escorting charisma.)

353
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,040
Did he really do that?

354
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,580
Isn't that what the police do when they put a criminal in their car?

355
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,940
- I was in a rush.
 - He squished my hat.

356
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,680
(He was so tense.)

357
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,580
- It's nice, though.
 - They look great together.

358
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,840
It's spring for them.

359
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
When the spring breeze blows

360
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,940
It's making me nervous.

361
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,580
- Really.
 - It's making me very nervous.

362
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,680
This is interesting.

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,440
They told me to dress up for you today.

364
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,580
So I went to the salon to put make-up on.

365
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,440
What's the occasion?

366
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
This is fun.

367
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,680
Isn't this the first time...

368
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,710
we meet alone?

369
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,410
It's not even Monday today.

370
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,040
- You're right. It's not Monday.
 - I know.

371
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,340
(Like a real couple, they're on a weekend date.)

372
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,940
What is the occasion?

373
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,040
Oh, my. You're wearing full make-up.

374
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,640
I put on make-up and did my hair.

375
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,240
- What are we going to do today?
 - I don't know.

376
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,580
Did you eat yet?

377
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
No, so I made a reservation.

378
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,366
You even made a reservation?

379
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm embarrassed, Ji Hyo.

380
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,510
I was so embarrassed I couldn't tell you.

381
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,780
You even made a reservation?

382
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,740
Yes, well... Somewhere...

383
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,940
I don't think our relationship requires us to make reservations.

384
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,240
I know. We're completely fine with eating gukbap.

385
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,510
But I automatically began searching the web today.

386
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,780
They're going to the restaurant now.

387
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,580
(Arrived)

388
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,440
We're here.

389
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,040
Wait, Ji Hyo.

390
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,080
Don't get off yet, okay?

391
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,140
(He is such a gentleman.)

392
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
- Oh, my.
 - Gary, do you...

393
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,340
usually do that in real life?

394
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,240
- No.
 - You don't, right?

395
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,310
Hey!

396
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,580
Open the door.

397
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,034
(What is he doing?)

398
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm sorry.

399
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,840
I've never done this before.

400
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,440
My goodness.

401
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,410
I had to unlock it beforehand.

402
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,140
You had to unlock it.

403
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,140
But you know, you can win over a woman if you do that for two years.

404
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,540
It doesn't even take two years.

405
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,240
- Where is it?
 - Over here.

406
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,040
- Wow!
 - Is it a room?

407
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,640
(The special dining place that Gary prepared for today)

408
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,580
You two look too awkward.

409
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,610
- Gary, this is...
 - Do we?

410
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,240
It looks like we're on a blind date.

411
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,710
It's so awkward having to eat at a place like this with you.

412
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,680
- It's all good experience.
 - Since we're here,

413
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,840
let's have fun.

414
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,440
Of course.

415
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,610
(He gets up.)

416
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,440
(He continues to act like a gentleman.)

417
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,040
- He's doing it again.
 - I've never done that before.

418
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
- You're great.
 - You look natural.

419
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
(Laughing)

420
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,940
Did you just do this for me?

421
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
- Of course.
 - Thank you.

422
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,376
She seems to enjoy it, though.

423
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,040
(Embarrassed)

424
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
- She's smiling a lot.
 - Ji Hyo,

425
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,940
here's a flower that looks like you.

426
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,440
(Here's a flower that looks like you.)

427
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,620
Gosh, his comment...

428
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,140
What is he saying?

429
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,240
Here's a flower that looks like you.

430
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,780
All right.

431
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,840
If it were in the past, I would have said it more naturally.

432
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,940
Why do we need to eat here?

433
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,840
Why did you reserve this place?

434
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,510
This is really awkward. Is this the bell?

435
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,680
(Is this the bell?)

436
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,827
Why did you say that?

437
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,140
- I saw it for the first time.
 - Since we're here,

438
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,730
- let's enjoy our meal.
 - Then is it a bomb?

439
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,580
It was just way too awkward.

440
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,940
But that's making me more interested.

441
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,040
- I'm nervous.
 - Here's the menu.

442
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,780
- Is this the menu?
 - Yes.

443
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,940
(The waiter gives them a fancy menu.)

444
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,480
- We have a special course menu.
 - Okay.

445
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,940
I'll take your order when you're ready.

446
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,110
What do pretty ladies usually order?

447
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,510
Gary, it's 110 dollars.

448
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,940
(Oh my goodness.)

449
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,340
Why do you care about the price?

450
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,240
(Ji Hyo, don't worry about that.)

451
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,940
Ji Hyo...

452
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,040
He's showing off.

453
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,510
Ji Hyo,

454
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,483
you don't have to worry about the price.

455
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,410
The manager is here.

456
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,110
Just eat.

457
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,740
- I'll have tenderloin.
 - Tenderloin, it is.

458
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,840
How would you like your tenderloin?

459
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,810
It should be like...

460
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,810
Ji Hyo's lips...

461
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,910
(It should be like Ji Hyo's lips?)

462
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,610
Ji Hyo's lips...

463
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,810
(Smiling)

464
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,940
- You shouldn't have said that.
 - It's embarrassing.

465
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,040
(It's the worst comment ever to bring out a smile.)

466
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
What did you mean by that?

467
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,810
He used to say those comments more brazenly.

468
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,940
Since we'll be driving,

469
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,440
we won't be able to drink.

470
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,810
- Are there non-alcoholic ones?
 - Yes, there are.

471
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,210
- Oh, really?
 - I'll get it for you.

472
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,840
- Thank you.
 - Thank you. Make it tasty, please.

473
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,710
I'll have a non-alcoholic cocktail...

474
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,440
that is as fresh as Ji Hyo's scent.

475
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,610
(I'm so fed up with you.)

476
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,310
- As fresh as her scent.
 - Okay, I got it.

477
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,990
I could say these things smoothly three years ago, right?

478
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,010
It's so awkward now.

479
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,610
It's been quite a while.

480
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,483
It was hard to say these comments.

481
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:54,440
She picked you as the person she feels the most awkward...

482
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,940
- to eat with.
 - Right, she did.

483
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,510
I actually...

484
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,140
had a meal with Kwang Soo once.

485
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,610
You are the first member to see separately other than him.

486
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,940
- Right.
 - I went tanning with Jong Kook...

487
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,410
several times.

488
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,610
(What?)

489
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,810
It's weird that you went tanning together.

490
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,250
(Jealous)

491
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,340
Will you go with me too?

492
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,510
He's jealous.

493
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,820
I want you to tan with me.

494
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,510
Our food is here.

495
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,110
I will serve the appetiser.

496
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,340
(He serves the appetiser.)

497
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,810
How should I eat this?

498
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,710
(It's an interesting one.)

499
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,940
(Munching)

500
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,340
Oh, it's a course meal.

501
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,710
Wipe her lips! Wipe her lips!

502
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,240
- Wipe her lips!
 - Wow.

503
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,040
(Shall I lay my hand on her lips?)

504
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,300
- Wipe her lips!
 - Wow.

505
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,610
It's so refreshing.

506
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,810
(In your dreams)

507
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,140
- It's refreshing.
 - Is it delicious?

508
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,366
- Yes.
 - Ji Hyo did it by herself.

509
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,440
- That's a bit too...
 - Well, you...

510
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,510
- What do you mean?
 - That's what the viewers want.

511
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,510
You should have intentionally put the foam on your lips.

512
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,840
You better kiss before the end of the date.

513
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,250
Lovers usually take breaks...

514
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,710
and talk while eating.

515
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,510
Do you want to see what lovers usually do?

516
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,840
- What do they do?
 - Give me your hand.

517
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,710
(Open your hand like this.)

518
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,840
This is what they do.

519
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,740
(This is what they do.)

520
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,340
Don't they?

521
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,510
(It's their first date...)

522
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,250
(as well as their first physical contact.)

523
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,250
(Will they continue on as real lovers?)

524
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,940
- How do they eat?
 - They don't.

525
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,510
Eating isn't important.

526
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,127
(She takes her hand away.)

527
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,000
(Irritated)

528
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,910
(Flinching)

529
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,940
- We came to eat, so we should eat.
 - She's really irritated.

530
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
Don't you really hate that?

531
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,810
You look like you just saw a bug.

532
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Ji Hyo, how's Chen Bolin?

533
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,610
Is he nice to you?

534
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,710
(Her Chinese "We Got Married" partner is Chen Bolin.)

535
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,810
He is nice to me.

536
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,403
Is he?

537
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,710
Gary eats so pitifully.

538
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,810
I can't ask any more.

539
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,840
Chen Bolin also cooked me dinner.

540
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,210
- Really?
 - Really?

541
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,610
- Is he good at cooking?
 - Yes.

542
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,010
What do you call him?

543
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,940
Do you call him Bolin?

544
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,837
I was so jealous then.

545
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,340
I will whisper it in your ear.

546
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,940
- Really? What is it?
 - Is she going to whisper?

547
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,640
They really had a nickname.

548
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,240
(Whispering)

549
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,610
(Giggling)

550
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,410
- What did she say?
 - What was it?

551
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,840
- Really?
 - I'm curious.

552
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,610
- Really?
 - Really.

553
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,610
Let's make our own nicknames.

554
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,810
I'll call you "Jiji".

555
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,580
(Please...)

556
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,940
- Please don't.
 - Why?

557
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,440
Don't do it.

558
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,410
But you call him "Bobo".

559
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,040
(But you call him "Bobo".)

560
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,710
- "Bobo"?
 - "Bobo"?

561
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,940
- What does "Bobo" mean?
 - The "Bo" is from his name.

562
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,610
Oh, because it's Bolin Chen.

563
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,910
- So it's "Bobo".
 - Does he call you "Mengmeng?"

564
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
- How did you know?
 - Right?

565
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,510
Is it really "Mengmeng"?

566
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,940
- It means cute in Chinese.
 - Right.

567
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,440
Right? "Mengmengda" means cute.

568
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,510
Right.

569
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,040
Let's do something after this.

570
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,610
(After we are done eating...)

571
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,810
Do you want to go watch a movie...

572
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,140
like how ordinary lovers do?

573
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,240
(Do you want to watch a movie?)

574
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,493
- Do you want to watch horror movie?
 - No.

575
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,827
Lovers should watch a horror movie.

576
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:00,310
That's how they get closer.

577
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,017
I want to watch...

578
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:03,540
Something like...

579
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,010
(Is it romance, comedy or action?)

580
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,940
"My Love, Don't Cross That River".

581
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,010
(It's a serious movie.)

582
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,010
(Sharing thoughts on life and death on their first date)

583
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,710
- What was that?
 - "My Love, Don't Cross That River".

584
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,840
They no longer show it at the theatres.

585
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,810
Why do you have to watch that kind of movie?

586
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,583
- Come on.
 - I really like...

587
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,040
family movies.

588
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,710
- It's over now.
 - But...

589
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,380
this is Ji Hyo. It's Ji Hyo.

590
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,540
Ji Hyo was so defensive yesterday.

591
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,440
I booked a nice place.

592
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,640
- Did you?
 - Yes.

593
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,940
- Really?
 - Yes.

594
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,710
Is it only for two?

595
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,240
It's a place only for two.

596
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Ji Hyo!

597
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
- It's dark already.
 - Thank you.

598
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,140
- They had dinner.
 - The car is on your right.

599
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,840
- Gary!
 - Yes?

600
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,410
I think it gets more interesting at night.

601
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,440
Put your arm around mine.

602
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
- They are holding hands!
 - Wow!

603
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,040
(Naturally)

604
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,940
- Put your arm around mine.
 - They are holding hands!

605
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,310
(Gary and Ji Hyo are holding hands.)

606
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,010
- This is a date indeed.
 - You let me hold your hand!

607
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
All right.

608
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,340
(They've become closer.)

609
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,140
Ji Hyo, come here.

610
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,510
(He becomes too shy and lets go of her hand.)

611
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,240
He became too awkward.

612
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,940
- He's really shy.
 - Wait, I'm stuck.

613
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,410
Ji Hyo, I'm stuck!

614
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,710
Ji Hyo!

615
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,240
(He exaggerates because he likes her laughter.)

616
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,510
She laughs so much.

617
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,810
- She's in a good mood.
 - I like the vibe.

618
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,340
Are you in a good mood?

619
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,510
It feels different at night.

620
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,840
A date officially starts when the sun goes down.

621
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,303
Does it?

622
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:35,810
What did you prepare next?

623
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,840
(What is this special theatre that she prepared?)

624
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm really excited to find out what you've prepared.

625
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,603
- Let's watch a movie.
 - Okay.

626
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,293
Today,

627
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,310
it doesn't feel like I'm working, but...

628
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,510
- Like your playing?
 - Yes, it does.

629
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,540
(They're in a great mood and having fun.)

630
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,510
What is this? Ji Hyo,

631
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,600
did you rent a place?

632
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,483
It's not a theatre.

633
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:02,610
Let's get off. Wait, Ji Hyo!

634
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,840
Don't open it yet!

635
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,240
(Wait!)

636
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,610
(He acts like a gentleman once more...)

637
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,840
(but fails again.)

638
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,210
Don't do this.

639
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,040
You had to unlock and open it.

640
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,140
- Yes.
 - I waited to see how you'd do it.

641
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,540
I forgot again.

642
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,610
- I love this vibe.
 - You are so funny.

643
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,493
Where are we going?

644
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,310
Going to a theatre is also nice.

645
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,510
(Going to a theatre is nice.)

646
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,940
But since it's our first time watching a movie together...

647
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,040
(She wants something special.)

648
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840
Ji Hyo, you look so pretty today...

649
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,510
in this dress.

650
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,940
- Is it nice?
 - Yes.

651
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,040
I wore this for you. I never wore this before.

652
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,340
You are the start of spring.

653
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,640
(Ji Hyo is the beginning of spring.)

654
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,340
Women like such comments although they say they don't.

655
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,810
It's strange.

656
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,610
(Welcome to Monday Couple's personal theatre.)

657
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,840
Oh, what is this?

658
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,710
Ji Hyo, where are you taking me?

659
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,810
(Welcome to Monday Couple's personal theatre.)

660
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,610
Oh my goodness.

661
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,240
Well...

662
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,810
- Wait!
 - Wait?

663
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,840
- Can I come in?
 - Ta-da!

664
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,740
What? What is it?

665
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,403
- Wow!
 - Is it their private theatre?

666
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:09,610
Wow, Ji Hyo!

667
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,910
(Romantic theatre that used the sky as a ceiling)

668
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,730
Did you prepare the candles?

669
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,640
- Those? It's great, right?
 - Yes.

670
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,610
- Look at the view.
 - It's our...

671
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,840
(Touched)

672
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,603
This is awesome.

673
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,010
Samseong-dong is that way.

674
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,840
Look over there.

675
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,580
- That's Samseong-dong and...
 - This is just amazing.

676
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,710
(A night view of Seoul)

677
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,340
- That way...
 - That's Gangnam Station.

678
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,540
- Watch out for the stairs.
 - The view up here is so nice.

679
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,240
I know. Wow!

680
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,210
And what are these?

681
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,610
- Wow, what is this?
 - Gosh.

682
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,710
- Gary.
 - Yes?

683
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,510
- Pour me some juice.
 - Okay!

684
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,940
They're having the time of their lives.

685
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,340
- The vibe is so good.
 - It's nice.

686
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,710
Isn't the vibe great?

687
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,210
Wasn't it a bit cold outside?

688
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,010
- It was.
 - Of course.

689
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,710
- She's fixing her makeup.
 - She is.

690
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,740
Why are you suddenly fixing your makeup?

691
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,810
Why are you applying lip gloss while I'm pouring juice?

692
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,110
What are you trying to say?

693
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,640
What does that mean?

694
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,710
(He pours grape juice instead of wine.)

695
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,140
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

696
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,410
(Cheers!)

697
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,510
- Wow, the sound is nice.
 - Look at their glasses.

698
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,810
- It's great.
 - The vibe is nice.

699
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,040
They're feeling great.

700
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,310
(They don't seem to be awkward any more.)

701
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,510
- Goodness.
 - They look so nice together.

702
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,010
(They don't seem to be awkward any more.)

703
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,010
(He acts like a gentleman and feeds her marshmallows.)

704
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
It's so awkward.

705
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,340
It wasn't even in my mouth, but you pulled the spoon out.

706
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,510
Did I pull out too early?

707
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,027
(He still lacks some skills.)

708
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:43,280
She's shy.

709
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,340
- It was so cold.
 - Let's watch a movie.

710
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,440
- Shall we?
 - Sure.

711
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,410
Let's watch "Begin Again". But before that, Ji Hyo.

712
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,510
(Wait a moment.)

713
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,383
Since you prepared...

714
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,210
such a nice place...

715
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,410
- Are they socks?
 - I got these from the States.

716
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,610
- Really?
 - They're matching socks.

717
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,640
Oh, really?

718
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,810
I think the red one will suit you.

719
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,710
- Okay.
 - I will take the white one.

720
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,710
- Are you going to wear them now?
 - Yes, it's cold.

721
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,840
Okay, then.

722
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,610
Gary, thanks!

723
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,140
- I will wear on top of this.
 - A big present is too much.

724
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,940
- It's better than expensive gifts.
 - It will be too much.

725
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,510
- Start with small gifts.
 - Gary,

726
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,640
don't I look like an American football player?

727
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,810
Gosh, Gary.

728
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,880
Your socks...

729
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,140
- I already feel warm...
 - They are in a good mood.

730
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,830
after wearing them.

731
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,040
Gosh, I love this.

732
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,240
(A couple's love begins at the theatre.)

733
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,340
It feels great.

734
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,140
(Gary tries to get close to Ji Hyo.)

735
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,340
- We were both tired.
 - I'm so tired.

736
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,340
- I was sleepy.
 - Gary always sleeps during a movie.

737
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,640
Gary always sleeps.

738
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
- I'm so tired.
 - He slept during my movie too.

739
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,340
Oh, goodness. I'm getting sleepy.

740
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
(Gary looks for an opportunity to touch Ji Hyo.)

741
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,140
(She sits up.)

742
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,627
- She was very defensive.
 - I knew it.

743
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:05,640
(I know what you're thinking.)

744
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,340
- Gosh.
 - Your nose is red.

745
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,940
(Let me lay my head on your lap.)

746
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,030
Look at her face.

747
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,340
- Your nose is red.
 - I didn't see her face back then.

748
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,840
Cover yourself with this blanket. It's chilly.

749
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,040
- I'm okay.
 - You should.

750
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,140
- I'm really okay.
 - Don't be like that.

751
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,040
You're making me uncomfortable.

752
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,140
(Ji Hyo is annoyed.)

753
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,820
- She's annoyed.
 - She got angry.

754
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,920
She did seem angry.

755
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,440
I guess it won't work out for them.

756
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,540
- It won't work out.
 - It won't.

757
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,640
(Monday Couple is still not close enough.)

758
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,210
- Use this blanket. I insist.
 - No, really. I'm fine.

759
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,040
- You make me uncomfortable.
 - I have socks on.

760
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,240
That doesn't make any difference. You even have holes in your pants.

761
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,440
- I'm okay.
 - Don't worry about me.

762
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,040
- Don't be like that.
 - I'm really okay.

763
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,840
- I would feel bad.
 - Then let's share it.

764
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,140
(She proposes to share the blanket.)

765
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,910
(Yes!)

766
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,440
- I'll cover you.
 - Okay.

767
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,740
You're sharing a blanket.

768
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,040
- And then...
 - You're sharing a blanket.

769
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,640
- Let's share it.
 - Cover yourself.

770
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,340
A moment like this can be awkward.

771
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,830
(Gary tries putting his hand around Ji Hyo's shoulder.)

772
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,040
There you go.

773
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,637
Don't do this.

774
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:19,040
(Ji Hyo keeps pushing Gary away.)

775
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,840
- "Don't do this."
 - She kept pushing me away.

776
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,640
I wanted to try something new.

777
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,740
"I wanted to try something new."

778
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,140
I'm just wondering.

779
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,940
Did it make you nervous to go on a date with me?

780
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,840
I realised one thing.

781
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,740
- It's not awkward to be around you.
 - Of course, it's not.

782
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,910
- It doesn't look awkward.
 - I knew it wouldn't be,

783
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,520
- Why don't you look at each other?
 - but...

784
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,240
the idea of going on a date did make me nervous.

785
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,340
But you made it so fun.

786
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,040
What will you be doing on Wednesday?

787
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,310
(Gary wants to ask her out.)

788
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,740
- I'll be busy.
 - Right. Me too.

789
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,440
(It's their first date in 6 years.)

790
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,310
(Monday Couple enjoys their romantic night.)

791
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,740
(The movie is over.)

792
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,140
It's over.

793
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,140
Ji Hyo, thank you so much.

794
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,540
You're welcome. Thank you.

795
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,420
If it weren't for you, I would've never worn...

796
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,310
matching socks with anybody.

797
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,440
We should wear them on our next shooting day.

798
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,440
- Tomorrow?
 - Should we wear them tomorrow?

799
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,110
All right, let's do that.

800
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,540
Oh, that's what happened.

801
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,140
Are you sure you didn't throw them away?

802
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,840
You said you would wear them today.

803
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,040
- You're not wearing them either.
 - I am wearing them!

804
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,440
(Gary kept his promise.)

805
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,140
But look at you!

806
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,810
You're always like this!

807
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,310
- Ji Hyo, Gary is wearing them.
 - I kept my word!

808
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,940
Ji Hyo, you should be wearing them.

809
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,240
Gary must be so disappointed.

810
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,740
- Gosh...
 - I just found out.

811
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,340
We have one more thing to do.

812
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,240
- What will that be?
 - What do we have to do?

813
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,327
What kind of car is that?

814
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,210
- Do you know what it is?
 - Can't you leave us alone?

815
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,730
Where are we going?

816
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,340
I should have taken the wheel.

817
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,710
(Where would their last destination be?)

818
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,540
(They arrive at their last destination.)

819
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,740
No way.

820
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,430
(They arrive at their last destination.)

821
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,640
Where are we?

822
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,940
Is this a hospital?

823
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,340
A hospital?

824
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,640
- It says "Examination Centre."
 - Why are we here?

825
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,720
(Why are we at a hospital?)

826
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
- What's happening?
 - What's going on?

827
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,810
- Did you have a check-up?
 - It's late at night.

828
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,440
You'll find out soon.

829
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,940
- Really?
 - Yes.

830
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,640
- I don't know the results yet.
 - Ji Hyo.

831
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,940
Why are we here?

832
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,540
We must be getting an MRI scan.

833
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,640
- Why? Why are we here?
 - I don't know.

834
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,210
- Is it...
 - Is it to see if they're in love?

835
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,010
- Yes, to see if we like each other.
 - Exactly.

836
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,240
If you like the other person,

837
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,940
- can we see that?
 - Usually, we scan our hearts.

838
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,640
- But we had our brains scanned.
 - Really?

839
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
- It will be impossible to lie.
 - It was real.

840
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,840
- Will we see the result?
 - We had an MRI scan.

841
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,020
(Let's find out how they really feel by scanning their brains.)

842
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,710
- Hello.
 - Come in.

843
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,940
As you can see,

844
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,540
- this is the MRI room.
 - Yes.

845
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,240
We're going to find out...

846
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,840
what you two really feel about each other.

847
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,710
(Will our true feelings be scanned?)

848
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,340
- Can you actually find that out?
 - Yes, we can.

849
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,640
Do you think love can be figured out through one's brain?

850
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,540
By examining the response of your cerebral nerves,

851
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,240
- we can find that out.
 - That's amazing.

852
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,110
Is that really possible?

853
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,240
Can you really do that?

854
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,840
You'll be surprised at the result.

855
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,440
Ji Hyo, we won't be able to hide our feelings any more.

856
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Exactly, because it's scientific.

857
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,640
- But...
 - We had our heartbeats checked,

858
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,540
and we even took a lie detector test once.

859
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,440
Will it be impossible to manipulate the result?

860
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,140
This is one of the most accurate tests.

861
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,240
Really?

862
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,340
I don't know why, but I'm getting scared.

863
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,540
(What will happen to them?)

864
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,140
- I haven't done this before.
 - So will we get an MRI scan?

865
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,340
Is that really possible?

866
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,540
- Everything will become clear.
 - Really?

867
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,340
- Let's see.
 - It'll answer our question.

868
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,940
It'll give us an answer.

869
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,183
We will definitely find out each other's feelings.

870
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:18,240
Will we get to see the result today?

871
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,410
- Really?
 - The result should come out.

872
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,040
You two must be nervous.

873
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,240
- Everything will become clear.
 - Really?

874
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,740
So we will find out today.

875
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,320
(How will science define their feelings?)

876
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,610
Part of me is scared.

877
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,440
So many people love Monday Couple.

878
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,740
(Science will give her the answer to something she doesn't know.)

879
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,740
I hope they'll take it well regardless of what the result is.

880
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,640
What's your guess on Gary's result?

881
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,110
(What's your guess on Gary's result?)

882
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,140
I bet he feels the same way as I do.

883
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,110
Ji Hyo, although we don't know what the result will be yet,

884
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,710
if it turns out that you have feelings for me,

885
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,840
I'll give us a second thought.

886
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
(He'll give them a chance.)

887
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,040
What are their true feelings?

888
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,940
(What will their true feelings be?)

889
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,150
- All right.
 - I can't wait to find out.

890
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,650
Let's find out their MRI scan results.

891
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,840
I wouldn't be surprised if they had feelings for each other.

892
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,650
Please welcome Professor Kim Byung Jun.

893
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,740
Hello.

894
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,540
- Hello.
 - Hello.

895
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,440
- Hello.
 - Is the result reliable?

896
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,540
Although this method is not widely being used yet,

897
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,440
- a lot of research is being done.
 - Oh, I see.

898
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,540
I see.

899
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,340
Professor Kim will tell us the truth behind Monday Couple.

900
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Please announce the MRI results.

901
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:53,110
As you watched, they put on special goggles.

902
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,040
We showed Ji Hyo some pictures of Gary,

903
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,650
and we showed pictures of Ji Hyo to Gary...

904
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,650
to examine which part of their brains were activated.

905
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,540
This is very scientific indeed.

906
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,450
- Let's look at Gary's result first.
 - Let's see it.

907
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,840
We showed him 12 pictures of Ji Hyo for 4 minutes.

908
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,240
- For 4 minutes?
 - Yes.

909
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,110
Let's look at how Gary's brain reacted to pictures of Ji Hyo.

910
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:24,827
Do you see the heart shape in the middle of his brain?

911
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:26,940
- It's called the "Brain stem".
 - I see.

912
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,210
When you're passionately in love,

913
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,840
this part of the brain is activated.

914
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,450
When shown pictures of Ji Hyo,

915
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:46,510
(What are his true feelings towards Ji Hyo?)

916
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,810
it made him very calm as if he saw something very familiar.

917
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,940
- Is that what you feel?
 - It's just friendship, right?

918
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,150
When shown random pictures,

919
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,440
an average person would find at least some of them intriguing,

920
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,640
but it didn't happen to Gary. He remained very calm.

921
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,410
I see.

922
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,150
- She's like a mum to him.
 - She makes him comfortable.

923
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,540
Wow.

924
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,840
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.
 - How did she react?

925
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,450
This is when Ji Hyo was shown pictures of Gary.

926
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,940
As you can see, many parts of the brain were evidently activated.

927
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,650
Here is the heart-shaped part.

928
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,950
This part is activated when you see someone you love.

929
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,640
We could see that this part of her brain was activated.

930
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,040
- Really?
 - What's going on?

931
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
- Ji Hyo!
 - Was Ji Hyo the one in love?

932
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,310
Goodness.

933
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,150
- Is that why you pushed him away?
 - Was that me?

934
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,940
- What's going on?
 - Really?

935
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,040
Was Ji Hyo the one in love?

936
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,650
- So that's why.
 - You little cutie. Goodness.

937
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,040
The basal ganglion which indicates positive affection...

938
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,340
- was activated as well.
 - Is that how she feels?

939
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,840
What? Really?

940
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,710
Love sometimes can take the form of comradeship.

941
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,540
In the brains of people in long-term relationships,

942
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,040
the cortex, which is in charge of perception, is activated.

943
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,410
Her brain indicated mild affection rather than passionate love.

944
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,150
- Mild affection?
 - Yes.

945
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,740
- It's comradeship.
 - It's more like comradeship.

946
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,440
That's right. This can be found...

947
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,740
in the brains of new couples...

948
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,540
- In the early stages?
 - or very old couples.

949
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,650
- "Old couples".
 - "Old couples".

950
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,810
They're not even a couple.

951
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,740
They're like an old couple.

952
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,940
I know you're called "Monday Couple"

953
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,240
Unfortunately, the examination was on Sunday.

954
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,540
- Sir!
 - Sir, you're pretty witty.

955
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,740
Gosh...

956
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,040
Wait. Are you really a doctor?

957
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,040
- Is he a comedian?
 - I know.

958
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,940
You're saying the result could be different if tested today, right?

959
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,740
- Is that right?
 - Well, there is a chance.

960
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,340
- That made me question him.
 - I know.

961
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,540
- There are comedians...
 - He was so serious.

962
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,840
- There are comedians like him.
 - You're right.

963
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,621
- You showed him other pictures too.
 - How did he react...

964
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,840
to Seolhyun's picture?

965
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,410
- His brain's reaction showed...
 - What is it?

966
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,184
a typical pattern of a person madly in love.

967
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:13,740
(It's official that he's in love with Seolhyun.)

968
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,940
- You were too passionate for her.
 - Seolhyun.

969
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,650
(A picture of Seolhyun made his brain go crazy.)

970
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,210
Really?

971
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,737
Partially, it's a sign of...

972
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:25,040
- Desire?
 - a sexual...

973
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,740
- What?
 - You piece of trash!

974
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,440
- How dare you?
 - Do you want to die?

975
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,130
- I will...
 - Seolhyun will...

976
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,310
This has nothing to do with my own will.

977
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,040
It's my brain.

978
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
How did Ji Hyo's brain react to Bo Gum's picture?

979
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,410
How did she react to Bo Gum's picture?

980
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,940
Ji Hyo only showed humane affection towards him.

981
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,650
- You are strange.
 - Right.

982
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,650
- How did she react to Kwang Soo?
 - Open your heart, Ji Hyo.

983
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,040
Part of the brain related to love was activated,

984
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,340
but the part related to fear and terror was also...

985
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,150
Part related to fear and terror...

986
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,310
From Kwang Soo?

987
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,740
The part related to unpleasant feelings...

988
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,840
"Unpleasant feelings"?

989
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,340
Those areas also were activated.

990
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,510
Both of them had that reaction to Kwang Soo's picture.

991
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,340
- They're afraid of being betrayed.
 - Why?

992
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,650
- He always betrays people.
 - What's wrong with me?

993
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,540
They felt unpleasant and scared when seeing your face.

994
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,040
- Honestly, Kwang Soo,
 - I am not threatening.

995
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,150
I just laughed when I saw your face.

996
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,650
- I laughed too.
 - It felt unpleasant.

997
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,840
- Why?
 - I didn't think of anything.

998
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,310
- But your brain showed it.
 - The result...

999
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,439
- It showed.
 - It showed. How fascinating.

1000
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,940
Do I look unpleasant?

1001
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,240
(Do I look unpleasant?)

1002
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,440
(So don't betray us.)

1003
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,650
So he was excited to see Seolhyun.

1004
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,040
All right. Please give it up for Professor Kim Byung Jun.

1005
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,240
Thank you!

1006
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,340
- That was fun.
 - That was really fun.

1007
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,840
Getting tested on a Sunday was the problem.

1008
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
It's more fun when it's explained by him.

1009
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,440
So are you two a couple just for work?

1010
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,240
- It's more like comradeship.
 - That's right.

1011
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,650
- That's it.
 - It's comradeship.

1012
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,440
We should've done this...

1013
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,950
- on Running Man's second year.
 - You're right.

1014
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,840
If they got the scan back then,

1015
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,540
- it would've been different.
 - Right.

1016
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,040
- Next.
 - Who is it?

1017
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,240
- Who is it now?
 - Who is it?

1018
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,340
- Me?
 - Let's check it.

1019
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,230
(Is Seok Jin really gullible?)

1020
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,840
(Me?)

1021
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,650
I really want to rip your name tag.

1022
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,340
I am not the spy.

1023
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,840
Then should I rip his?

1024
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,940
- What are you doing?
 - I'm so frustrated.

1025
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,140
Make a decision.

1026
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,410
My friend runs a chicken farm.

1027
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,950
And there are six legs on a chicken.

1028
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,740
When you plant the seed,

1029
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,210
ginseng grows on the bottom and tomatoes on top.

1030
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,940
Gosh, I want to invest 20,000, or better yet, 200,000 dollars.

1031
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,150
(Is he really gullible?)

1032
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,040
- "Is Seok Jin really gullible?"
 - "Is Seok Jin really gullible?"

1033
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,950
- Seok Jin is...
 - He is.

1034
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,240
I think he is.

1035
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,410
- But he has a lot of doubts.
 - Right?

1036
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,020
We talk about starting a business a lot.

1037
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,650
- But his idea always changes.
 - Right.

1038
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,440
- But he also doubts a lot.
 - You're right.

1039
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,910
- I have a lot of doubts.
 - He always doubts.

1040
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,340
Seok Jin is like this.

1041
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,940
He has a lot of doubts, so he is very thorough.

1042
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,130
But in the end, he chooses the path nobody would choose.

1043
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,340
- Right?
 - Yes.

1044
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,840
- That's why he gets fooled easily.
 - Yes.

1045
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,439
He doesn't trust what people around him tell him.

1046
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,410
But he easily trusts people he meets for the first time.

1047
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,740
(He trusts strangers easily.)

1048
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,840
- So he gets scammed a lot.
 - And...

1049
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,926
- That's right.
 - I trust people who are nice to me.

1050
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,540
Usually scammers are nice.

1051
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,240
- But...
 - He's very biased.

1052
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,540
Isn't everyone like that though?

1053
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,330
- Oh gosh!
 - What was that?

1054
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,840
(What just happened?)

1055
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,040
- That really surprised me.
 - What's that?

1056
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,450
Gosh, that surprised me.

1057
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,210
- What's that?
 - What's happening?

1058
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,610
- What?
 - What is it?

1059
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,640
(What's happening?)

1060
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,950
(Someone appears.)

1061
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,621
(Who is he?)

1062
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:31,240
(No way.)

1063
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,840
Look at the screen.

1064
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,940
Gosh...

1065
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,040
- Here?
 - He recognised us a while ago.

1066
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,340
- Isn't he the prince?
 - The prince...

1067
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,950
- He's the owner.
 - What's this?

1068
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,840
What's going on?

1069
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,140
- What's going on?
 - I should go outside.

1070
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,640
(What's happening to Seok Jin?)

1071
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,540
(Several days ago at a restaurant in Gangnam)

1072
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,540
(Jong Kook and Haha checked to see how gullible Seok Jin is.)

1073
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,240
This is a business proposal.

1074
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,410
- This business proposal is...
 - Yes.

1075
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,040
a result of a growing health awareness in Dubai.

1076
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,240
- It's a very special proposal.
 - It's "Jewel in the Dubai Palace".

1077
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,840
(Let's take a closer look.)

1078
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,040
- It looks believable.
 - Rice puffs will replace popcorn...

1079
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,020
- In Dubai.
 - In Dubai.

1080
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,640
Seok Jin will buy the idea at this point right here.

1081
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
This is all he needs.

1082
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,240
"Monthly profit of Dubai theatres' popcorn sales..."

1083
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,740
"is three million dollars."

1084
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,310
(It's a candid camera designed for Seok Jin.)

1085
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,210
The game is over. It's already over.

1086
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,330
He needs an Arabic name.

1087
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,040
The first condition for becoming the business partner...

1088
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,340
- is getting an Arabic name.
 - He will gladly do so.

1089
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,440
Of course.

1090
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,140
If Seok Jin is the target, we don't need this meeting.

1091
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,040
(Seok Jin appears.)

1092
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,940
- Welcome.
 - Why are you alone?

1093
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,240
They all went out to make phone calls.

1094
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,340
(Jong Kook naturally leads him to the designated seat.)

1095
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,210
- Gosh...
 - Hey.

1096
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,650
Did you come from the gym?

1097
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,040
Of course.

1098
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,240
Seok Jin, it's funny.

1099
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,403
You know that Korean rice puffs became a huge hit in Africa, right?

1100
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,817
- I don't know.
 - You don't know?

1101
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:13,740
- Listen to him.
 - Rice puffs became a huge hit.

1102
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,040
- Really?
 - But that's not important.

1103
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,940
Do you remember that man who managed everything in Dubai?

1104
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,650
Remember that prince?

1105
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,650
- Prince?
 - And...

1106
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,240
even though we aren't Arab, they approached us.

1107
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,820
Anyways, I'll cut to the chase.

1108
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,010
They want to sell rice puffs in Dubai.

1109
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,810
It's...

1110
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,140
And he...

1111
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,650
- really loves you.
 - What?

1112
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,440
- He really loves you.
 - What?

1113
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,340
- He does.
 - Why?

1114
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,240
- We don't know.
 - We don't know the reason.

1115
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,740
- Who is this?
 - I think they saw you...

1116
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,310
- The prince?
 - during our shoot in Dubai.

1117
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,520
- Really?
 - I think so. I'm not sure.

1118
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,540
First of all, their family...

1119
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,840
owns about 80 percent of all the theatres in Dubai.

1120
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,040
- Really?
 - Yes.

1121
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,410
The conditions are good.

1122
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,040
For the three of us...

1123
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,740
How much? Tell me.

1124
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,940
(He's very excited.)

1125
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,740
It's the price for the three of us.

1126
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,040
- So how much is it?
 - For the three of us...

1127
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,820
- It's the down payment.
 - Okay.

1128
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,640
- They will give us 10.
 - 10 million dollars?

1129
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,040
- 10 million dollars?
 - Yes.

1130
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,340
(He's very happy.)

1131
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
But wait. Listen.

1132
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,840
They secretly installed the camera.

1133
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,530
Did you guys put cameras in there?

1134
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,440
- He's really shocked.
 - Gosh...

1135
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,040
He was really shocked.

1136
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,440
He has no idea.

1137
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,640
(He's shocked.)

1138
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,740
What's this?

1139
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,040
(He can't believe what just happened.)

1140
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,440
Dubai's king is...

1141
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,240
- Hey.
 - What's that?

1142
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,420
- His face turned red.
 - Was that really a lie?

1143
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,640
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

1144
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,693
- This is crazy.
 - Gosh...

1145
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:52,717
So that's all gone?

1146
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:55,040
- Did he really believe that?
 - It already sounds strange.

1147
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,540
- How could he believe that?
 - I made it believable.

1148
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,140
- I really did.
 - He talks so well.

1149
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,240
You would've been fooled too.

1150
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,540
He would've been fooled too.

1151
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,830
The contract will range from 2 to 3 years.

1152
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,340
They are suggesting a five percent running guarantee.

1153
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,840
Is that per person? That's nice.

1154
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,010
- The rate is high.
 - I don't think it's per person.

1155
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,340
It doesn't make sense, right?

1156
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,430
Let's just take it as five percent per person.

1157
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,440
- Five percent per person?
 - Let's insist.

1158
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,640
- Let's do that.
 - Let's say,

1159
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,840
"Isn't it five percent per person?"

1160
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,040
"That's what we thought."

1161
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,340
(He's a genius entrepreneur!)

1162
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,540
You just have to say that.

1163
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,140
- He's good.
 - He's a genius dealer.

1164
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,110
- I'm pretty good.
 - He's a genius.

1165
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,740
But first, let's make it more...

1166
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,340
This isn't a prank, is it?

1167
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,420
This isn't a prank, is it?

1168
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,740
Wait. Wait.

1169
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,840
You're reacting as if we're on candid camera.

1170
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,840
I was surprised that time.

1171
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,640
I guess you wouldn't do that when money is involved.

1172
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
- Of course.
 - Of course, it'll be on TV.

1173
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,140
You can talk to him on the phone and ask him for the details.

1174
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,510
This is all we know so far.

1175
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,840
(Afraid he will find out, they get help from a friend.)

1176
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,140
(A friend arrives to save them.)

1177
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,740
- Hello.
 - Hello.

1178
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,640
- Did you come from Taiwan?
 - He surprised me.

1179
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,940
This is the business proposal they sent us.

1180
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,440
- What?
 - The word "Rice puffs" is...

1181
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,640
highlighted in red.

1182
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,040
We just mentioned theatres in this proposal.

1183
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
- This is it.
 - So that's it.

1184
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,310
- That's how it became famous.
 - But...

1185
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,140
- we won't just target theatres.
 - Korean culture must be popular.

1186
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,840
- Yes. We will be dealing with...
 - This is crazy.

1187
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,440
everyone in the entertainment industry.

1188
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,040
- Not just the theatres...
 - We should make...

1189
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,540
Arabic names right away.

1190
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,940
(He's so cool.)

1191
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,810
- Let's make about five of them.
 - What will be yours?

1192
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,040
- "Abdul"?
 - And the profit...

1193
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,440
(Abdul?)

1194
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,840
(This future rice puff dealer is very funny.)

1195
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,140
I will name myself "Abdul Wangko".

1196
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,540
(He's already very excited.)

1197
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,640
- How about "Kodull"?
 - Seok Jin,

1198
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,940
"Abdullah" means...

1199
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,140
How about "Kodullah"?

1200
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,983
- "Kodullah".
 - "Kodullah".

1201
00:46:49,983 --> 00:46:51,740
My first name is Kodullah.

1202
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,340
My middle name is Hassan.

1203
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,420
My last name is Mohammed.

1204
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,640
Kodullah Hassan Mohammed.

1205
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,840
- "Mohammed"?
 - Also known as...

1206
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,040
"Ko-Ha-Mo".

1207
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,810
(He will be known as "Ko-Ha-Mo".)

1208
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,240
He loves it.

1209
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,810
He's so happy.

1210
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,940
We need to come up with our theme song.

1211
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,640
(The contract requires them to make a theme song.)

1212
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,840
- For this one,
 - We have to write a song?

1213
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,740
I recommended you.

1214
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,240
Seok Jin is good at writing songs.

1215
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,140
He sang in Chinese back in China.

1216
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,740
He did.

1217
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,940
Rice puffs

1218
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,540
(He immediately makes a song on the spot.)

1219
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,410
Prince of Dubai and Korean rice puffs

1220
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,640
(Prince and the Korean rice puffs)

1221
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,740
Kodullah, Kodullah

1222
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,810
Rice puffs

1223
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,740
They stick to your mouth

1224
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,140
Kodullah

1225
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,840
Korean rice puffs in Dubai

1226
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,310
Where are you going to place it?

1227
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,140
Korean rice puffs Korean rice puffs

1228
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,810
(Korean rice puffs)

1229
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,140
Seok Jin looks so excited.

1230
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,410
(Thanks to Seok Jin, everyone is laughing.)

1231
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,040
He looks like he's having so much fun.

1232
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,140
Dubai Korean rice puffs Dubai Korean rice puffs

1233
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,040
Goodbye, popcorn

1234
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,840
- This is it.
 - Goodness.

1235
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,710
- This is going to be the song.
 - That sounds perfect.

1236
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,040
- It's in English too.
 - Right.

1237
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,240
- Korean rice puffs in Dubai
 - Korean rice puffs in Dubai

1238
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,503
- Goodbye, popcorn
 - Goodbye, popcorn

1239
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:10,110
It's going to be our song.

1240
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,310
Seok Jin looks really upset now.

1241
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,610
- I'm upset.
 - Seok Jin is more upset...

1242
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,124
- that he can't get the money.
 - I'm really upset.

1243
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:21,940
The prince is currently in Shanghai.

1244
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,510
He said that he wants to come here to meet you.

1245
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,840
We're more than happy to meet him.

1246
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,240
- Of course.
 - He can sleepover at my house.

1247
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,610
This is going great.

1248
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
This is great.

1249
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,710
Just before Seok Jin loses a great deal of money...

1250
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,210
through investment, he has that look on his face.

1251
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,410
(Beware of fraud!)

1252
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,910
He's flushed and excited.

1253
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,140
We wrote a contract.

1254
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,840
- We wrote a contract.
 - He already wrote a contract?

1255
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,410
- Really?
 - Actually,

1256
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,810
- we knew this already.
 - You guys are the worst.

1257
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,510
We've known of this already.

1258
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,140
Seok Jin was completely fooled.

1259
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,610
- Right.
 - Yes.

1260
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:03,810
(The meeting with the prince)

1261
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,410
(He visits the Running Man waiting room.)

1262
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,210
- You can sit over here.
 - Yes.

1263
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,810
- Yes.
 - This way.

1264
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,840
Please sit here.

1265
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,940
Sit down. Sit down, please.

1266
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,340
(Sit down. Sit down, please.)

1267
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,840
You are really handsome.

1268
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,210
(You are really handsome.)

1269
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,293
(Laughing)

1270
00:49:25,293 --> 00:49:27,556
You look very handsome.

1271
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,080
Handsome.

1272
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,310
(Haha arrives.)

1273
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,410
After 20 years.

1274
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,140
(Haha arrives.)

1275
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,810
Hello.

1276
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,310
Thank you. You're here.

1277
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,440
(Seok Jin is half shy and half excited.)

1278
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,737
(Speaking in a foreign language)

1279
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,510
He doesn't remember seeing...

1280
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,737
the other members, but he recognises you, Seok Jin.

1281
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:58,810
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1282
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,710
(Thank you so much.)

1283
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,393
- Hello.
 - This is awesome.

1284
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:08,710
- Could you introduce yourselves?
 - A good name.

1285
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,840
Okay.

1286
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,210
To show my respect,

1287
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,610
I came up with my Arabic name.

1288
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,240
(He got an Arabic name to sign the contract.)

1289
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,510
(Haha bursts out laughing.)

1290
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,010
(Nudging)

1291
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,483
(Don't be so rude in front of the prince.)

1292
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:24,510
- What's your Arabic name?
 - Kodullah.

1293
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,840
(Kodullah?)

1294
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,410
- He said to make it Jadullah.
 - Jadullah?

1295
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,510
- He recommends it to be Jadullah.
 - Jadullah.

1296
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,510
- Jadullah.
 - Jadullah.

1297
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,637
"Jadullah Hassan Mohammed".

1298
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:37,210
(Jadulla Hassan Mohammed)

1299
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:40,090
In short, it's going to be "Ja-Ha-Mo".

1300
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,310
Call me, "Jahamo".

1301
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,510
(Call me, Jahamo.)

1302
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,140
Like we talked about last time,

1303
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,403
he would like to sign a provisional contract.

1304
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:50,710
- Do I sign here?
 - Yes, at the bottom.

1305
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,810
Write the date too.

1306
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,293
(He signs the contract as if he's signing an autograph for a fan.)

1307
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:57,466
Rather than being business partners,

1308
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,410
I hope us to be close like brothers.

1309
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,810
(Like brothers)

1310
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,940
(Seok Jin wants to get closer to the prince.)

1311
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,610
Isn't that too much?

1312
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,010
- That's not it.
 - Don't rush like that.

1313
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:10,040
- Take time to get to know him.
 - I think he's uncomfortable.

1314
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,140
- That's not it.
 - He looks uncomfortable.

1315
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,610
I thought that...

1316
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,840
(They made the enormous contract with a blink of an eye.)

1317
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,610
(The prince leaves.)

1318
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,010
Hey.

1319
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,210
- We did it.
 - We're going successfully well.

1320
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,680
(We did it.)

1321
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,010
We did it.

1322
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,097
Is it really happening to me?

1323
00:51:33,097 --> 00:51:34,410
(I'm going to be rich now.)

1324
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,510
Oh, my.

1325
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,140
(I'm going to be rich now.)

1326
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,140
This is nonsense.

1327
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,240
(It was all a dream.)

1328
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,910
Goodness.

1329
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,510
- Thank you.
 - Are you not the prince?

1330
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,040
He's the fake prince.

1331
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,340
- Can you speak Korean?
 - A little.

1332
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,810
(He is in despair.)

1333
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,610
(Screaming)

1334
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,710
Goodness.

1335
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,210
Prince, is this the contract?

1336
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,140
- Seok Jin signed the contract.
 - He signed it.

1337
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,810
- He signed it.
 - I'll read what's written on it.

1338
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,040
- This is what Seok Jin agreed to.
 - Yes.

1339
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,240
I will not be late for the shooting.

1340
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,037
I will do whatever the staff tells me to do.

1341
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:14,637
I will not get angry for whatever I'm told to do.

1342
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:16,940
I'll help out the staff to clean after shooting the programme.

1343
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,040
(He took the lead in agreeing to regulations.)

1344
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,410
I will be the last to leave after the shooting.

1345
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,040
- It sounds great.
 - Really?

1346
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,310
This is what Seok Jin agreed to.

1347
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,810
- Yes.
 - You need to keep it.

1348
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,940
You need to follow the contract.

1349
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,840
- I must say...
 - Oh my goodness.

1350
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,940
he was surely happy.

1351
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,710
- It wasn't captured on camera,
 - I was really...

1352
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,310
but when we went out for a break,

1353
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,110
he held my hand tightly.

1354
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,710
He then said, "You did great. Now is the time."

1355
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,140
His eyes were teary.

1356
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,310
(Eyes teary and heart piercing)

1357
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,580
I felt really sorry. He kept on text-messaging me.

1358
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,710
(He's furious.)

1359
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,810
- I'm angrier at you.
 - Oh, my.

1360
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,990
- Stop it.
 - You should take up acting.

1361
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,040
- He's super gullible.
 - Really.

1362
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,637
He is surely gullible.

1363
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:58,610
He was born a nice person.

1364
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,210
(Jae Seok is the best MC and show host in Korea.)

1365
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,720
He is really nice.

1366
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,110
(But his instinct is hidden deep inside.)

1367
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,610
(Is Jae Seok really a nice person?)

1368
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:10,910
(Running Man Q and A)

1369
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,210
We have prepared the answers...

1370
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,493
for some questions regarding...

1371
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,140
the appearance of the members.

1372
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,140
- It's about Ji Hyo.
 - Many people asked that question.

1373
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,840
- Really.
 - We were asked so many times.

1374
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,410
- They ask if she is really pretty.
 - Right.

1375
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,840
- I tell them it's true.
 - Ji Hyo is pretty.

1376
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,680
- I answer them she is pretty.
 - What do you say, Gary?

1377
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,310
- I tell them she is pretty.
 - Right.

1378
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,340
It's true that she's pretty.

1379
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,710
She looks prettier on the photos of news articles...

1380
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,310
- rather than on Running Man.
 - That's right.

1381
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,840
- Or at a film preview.
 - She is always pretty.

1382
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,940
- Or at an awards ceremony.
 - I get surprised on those days.

1383
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,410
- She is pretty.
 - How do we answer this?

1384
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,810
- She is pretty.
 - We invited someone to prove it.

1385
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,240
Are they analysing Ji Hyo's face?

1386
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,510
- Are they analysing me?
 - They can't possibly.

1387
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,840
We have Doctor Kim Jong Myung with us today.

1388
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,140
- Welcome.
 - He's Jong Kook's brother.

1389
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,910
- Real brother?
 - Hello.

1390
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,410
He looks very gentle.

1391
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,610
My family.

1392
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,510
He has different genes from me.

1393
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,510
- Is he your real brother?
 - Yes.

1394
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,810
So are you starting a reality show with your family now?

1395
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,040
- What?
 - A family reality show.

1396
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,810
- No.
 - He may be.

1397
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,710
- Isn't this the beginning?
 - No, it's not.

1398
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,810
- Are you going to be on the show?
 - No, it's not like that.

1399
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,340
How is Jong Kook as a brother?

1400
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,780
Though he looks very tough,

1401
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,310
he acts like the youngest when he's home.

1402
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,510
- He is very tender-hearted.
 - Does he act like a baby?

1403
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,940
- Yes.
 - Does he...

1404
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,727
Why does he change when he steps out of the house?

1405
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,680
He's too rough outside.

1406
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,510
Have you ever been hit by him?

1407
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,040
- I've never been hit.
 - Really?

1408
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
It's a relief that he doesn't hit his own brother.

1409
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,140
I hit him a lot when we were young.

1410
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,610
Really?

1411
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,210
I can't imagine Jong Kook getting hit.

1412
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,240
- I don't hit anyone.
 - You've come to verify today.

1413
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,840
- Yes.
 - If Ji Hyo is really pretty.

1414
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,840
How can we prove if she is really pretty?

1415
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,810
We will analyse her face.

1416
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,210
We'll see if she is really pretty and if she is a beauty.

1417
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,710
- Please show us.
 - We'll check that now.

1418
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,510
Oh, gosh. Her eyes look swollen.

1419
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,140
It was taken just before.

1420
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,627
- Hey, you...
 - Yes, my face was swollen.

1421
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:56,040
The picture on the left is the typical beauty...

1422
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,840
- according to golden ratio.
 - It's a typical beauty.

1423
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,840
- They're nearly the same.
 - You're right.

1424
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,840
- In the case of Ji Hyo,
 - She does look very similar.

1425
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,140
she has the young-looking face...

1426
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,810
- according to this ratio.
 - Young-looking face.

1427
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,610
- She does look very young.
 - She does.

1428
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,780
The golden ratio means the forehead, middle part...

1429
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,510
and bottom part of the face are in exactly the same ratio.

1430
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,410
So the same ratio for forehead, middle part and lower part?

1431
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,610
- Is that so?
 - Yes.

1432
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,510
Nowadays, people prefer the ratio to be 1 to 1 to 0.8 or 0.9.

1433
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,710
- The lower part has to be smaller.
 - It's 0.8 for Ji Hyo.

1434
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,940
She has a really young face with her bottom part of the face nearly 0.8.

1435
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,780
He is verifying it.

1436
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,410
- Yes.
 - Wait.

1437
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,140
His facial proportion is 1 to 1 to 3.

1438
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,040
Does that make me look old?

1439
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,680
- His face is too long.
 - What's up with my face?

1440
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,110
- His face is closer to looking old.
 - Old.

1441
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,980
(Old-looking)

1442
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,710
- He does look old.
 - Right.

1443
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,640
His nose and bottom part of his face are big when it comes to the ratio.

1444
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,840
- He has a long chin.
 - Though the proportion isn't great,

1445
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,000
looking at the balance of his face, he is considered handsome.

1446
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,310
What is that angle about?

1447
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:00,303
It is to check if she has the perfect angle.

1448
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,810
If you take a look at the photo,

1449
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,940
it's exactly the angle. It's the typical.

1450
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,240
- It fits perfectly.
 - She has a very beautiful face.

1451
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,410
- Really?
 - Wow.

1452
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,510
- So there's no doubt she's pretty.
 - Right.

1453
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:14,410
My goodness. Ji Hyo doesn't even blush.

1454
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,110
- It's natural for her.
 - What if she did a surgery?

1455
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,837
- I'm just surprised.
 - Are her eyes natural?

1456
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:21,940
- I think so.
 - Is it true?

1457
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,510
- Is your nose natural?
 - Yes.

1458
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,410
- Didn't you do plastic surgeries?
 - I did not.

1459
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,410
- Can I touch your nose?
 - Yes, do as you please.

1460
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,310
(Sure, you can touch my nose.)

1461
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,610
(He pushes her nose up.)

1462
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,510
(Seriously?)

1463
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,710
(Let's take a look at your nose.)

1464
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,810
- Didn't you get a nose job?
 - I didn't.

1465
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,240
- Didn't you?
 - I didn't put anything in.

1466
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,840
I just cut some off like shortening trouser cuffs.

1467
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,310
(He just cut some off like shortening trouser cuffs.)

1468
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,610
- You cut your trouser if it's long.
 - Right.

1469
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,310
My nose was too big,

1470
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,737
so I reduced it a little.

1471
00:56:49,737 --> 00:56:51,810
So my nostrils are slightly different.

1472
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,637
The next question is... I'm curious about this too.

1473
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:57,040
- It's about Gary.
 - Gary.

1474
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,610
- Does he really look like a squid?
 - Squid?

1475
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,710
- Squid?
 - I ate that for lunch today.

1476
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,810
- I'm curious.
 - Gosh.

1477
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,940
- Isn't that an absurd question?
 - I'm really curious.

1478
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,840
People usually call those...

1479
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
ugly people like Gary like that.

1480
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,240
(Ugly people like Gary)

1481
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,340
We say those look like a squid.

1482
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,140
(What is that?)

1483
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,340
(Ta-da!)

1484
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,140
(A comparison of a squid and Gary)

1485
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,140
(That's hilarious.)

1486
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,573
- They look similar.
 - Doctor.

1487
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:29,410
Why don't you use a human figure for me?

1488
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,040
Why can't I be compared with a human?

1489
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
(Are you trying to make me cry?)

1490
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,940
Doctor, give that to me.

1491
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,510
- Gary, you look alike.
 - Give it to me.

1492
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:38,037
- Gary.
 - It's hilarious.

1493
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,390
- Gary.
 - Are you serious?

1494
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,740
Oh my goodness.

1495
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,010
Doctor,

1496
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,540
isn't it more appropriate for me...

1497
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,440
- to be compared with a human?
 - They look exactly the same.

1498
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,210
- It's so funny.
 - Why should it be a squid?

1499
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,140
(He should have used a human's face to make the comparison.)

1500
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,840
- Get out of my way!
 - Goodness.

1501
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,510
You should have used a human picture first...

1502
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,740
and changed it to a squid.

1503
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,810
- This is so funny.
 - I laughed so hard.

1504
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,140
- Well...
 - But...

1505
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,340
- they look similar.
 - It's strange.

1506
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,740
Wow, seriously.

1507
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,840
They look so similar!

1508
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,940
- Wow, really.
 - You used human drawings before.

1509
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,240
We compare ugly people with a squid like this...

1510
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,840
because they don't usually have clean-cut features...

1511
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,140
and have flat structured faces like squids.

1512
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,140
If you insist on asking if he looks like a squid, I have to agree to it.

1513
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,920
(If they keep asking if Gary looks like a squid, he has to admit it.)

1514
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,940
- Stop, please stop!
 - Goodness.

1515
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,040
(Stop! I can't take it any more!)

1516
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
- Stop!
 - Flat structured face.

1517
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,930
- It's so true.
 - Really.

1518
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,640
He's so persuasive. I got him right away.

1519
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,840
- They are not exactly the same.
 - They look alike.

1520
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,540
(It's official that Gary looks like a squid.)

1521
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,110
- Oh, really.
 - It's so strange.

1522
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,540
- Moving on to the next question.
 - I want Haha's comparison.

1523
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,740
- All right.
 - It's about Haha and Gary.

1524
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,040
I'm curious about this.

1525
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,610
- Who asked this?
 - This is a very sensitive question.

1526
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,340
This can't even be a question.

1527
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,440
- This is harsh.
 - How will that come out?

1528
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,940
This is too much.

1529
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,740
It's impossible to decide who's handsome and who's ugly.

1530
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,440
Look! I'm so cute!

1531
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,640
Goodness.

1532
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,940
(Their faces are shockingly ugly.)

1533
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,430
Here it is!

1534
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,840
(It's Gary versus Haha.)

1535
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,010
(This is an unexpected big match.)

1536
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,340
Can I have a squid's picture here?

1537
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,240
Can I have a squid, please?

1538
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,540
- It's cute!
 - In the middle, please.

1539
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,340
- It's cute, isn't it?
 - Wait a second.

1540
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,040
- Isn't it?
 - He looks like a sea anemone.

1541
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,520
- A squid and baby octopus.
 - I look so cute!

1542
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,540
You two are both from the sea.

1543
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,240
- Haha looks like a baby octopus.
 - I'm so cute.

1544
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,240
I thought it's Gary before and after the perm.

1545
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,640
Please, don't.

1546
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,910
- I mean it, really.
 - Hey.

1547
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,640
- You go and see yourself!
 - Gosh.

1548
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,440
- It's like pictures in a hair shop.
 - I've never been mad at you, right?

1549
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,440
- Right.
 - Don't make me mad today.

1550
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,340
- Okay.
 - This is too much.

1551
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,540
(You and I are neck-and-neck.)

1552
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,710
- This isn't right.
 - I analysed and compared them.

1553
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,440
The biggest differences between them are nose and face contour.

1554
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,540
Haha has bigger nose and clearer contour,

1555
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,840
making his face more solid.

1556
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,240
If I have to decide who's more handsome,

1557
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,730
I'd say that Haha's face is more likeable.

1558
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,710
- I agree with him.
 - I admit that.

1559
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,140
Being likeable is different from being handsome.

1560
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,840
- Now, it's time for me.
 - This is going to be interesting.

1561
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,840
- This must be huge.
 - Let's go!

1562
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,210
(Does Jae Seok really look like Yoda?)

1563
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,810
- Oh, Yoda.
 - I'm fully sure of this.

1564
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,640
- It can't even be a question.
 - This is so not true.

1565
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,440
They look the same.

1566
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,740
Goodness.

1567
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,440
(They're all surprised to see the comparison.)

1568
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,140
(They look exactly the same.)

1569
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,140
- This is hilarious!
 - He should take off his glasses.

1570
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,627
This is...

1571
01:00:43,627 --> 01:00:45,140
What is this?

1572
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,110
This is hilarious.

1573
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,240
- I can't tell the difference.
 - Doctor, you went too far.

1574
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,940
- This is too much, really.
 - It should be without his glasses.

1575
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,140
I can't tell who's who!

1576
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,210
- Why are you doing this to me?
 - If you put glasses on Yoda,

1577
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,140
they will look exactly the same.

1578
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,740
Take off your glasses.

1579
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,240
- Are you saying we look alike?
 - You look alike.

1580
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,640
- Me and Yoda?
 - Right.

1581
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,140
- There's no need to explain it.
 - Totally.

1582
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,740
- This is too much.
 - No need to explain it.

1583
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,740
They do look alike surprisingly.

1584
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:13,140
- Is that so?
 - They both have a protruding mouth.

1585
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,940
- They have protruding eyes too.
 - Really.

1586
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,440
Also, their forehead bones above the eyes are protruding.

1587
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,140
- Right.
 - Those points make them look alike.

1588
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,240
- He said everything outright.
 - They might look the same...

1589
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,540
if Jae Seok does the double eyelids surgery.

1590
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,840
He gets double eyelids when he becomes a little tired.

1591
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,540
- I'm sure they would exactly same.
 - It's Jae Seok with double eyelids!

1592
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,240
- Now, this is...
 - What is that?

1593
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,440
- They look exactly the same!
 - What is this?

1594
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,003
If Jae Seok takes his glasses off and has double eyelids,

1595
01:01:42,003 --> 01:01:45,040
- they do look similar because of...
 - I got goose bumps.

1596
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,240
their eye wrinkles and protruding eyes and mouths.

1597
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,310
I wasn't sure at first, but they are more similar than I thought.

1598
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,840
- Did you say we look alike?
 - Yes.

1599
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,940
Our viewers gave you that nickname for a reason.

1600
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,640
Of course, there is a reason for it.

1601
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,940
- Goodness.
 - You two are really similar.

1602
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,140
You two really look similar.

1603
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,340
I thought the squid was the end,

1604
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,840
- but here came something worse.
 - You beat the squid.

1605
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,540
Anyway, Doctor Kim Jong Myung joined us today...

1606
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,230
to answer viewers' questions on our appearance.

1607
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,440
Please give him a round of applause!

1608
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,040
- Thank you.
 - He talks very well.

1609
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,240
- Moving on to the next question!
 - Okay.

1610
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,340
(Is Jae Seok really a nice person?)

1611
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,540
- Goodness.
 - What kind of question is that?

1612
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,740
- Is he really a nice person?
 - I said this so many times...

1613
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,340
- that he's a well-presented person.
 - He is nice.

1614
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,240
- He's a nice person.
 - That's true.

1615
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,540
- It's true that he's a nice guy.
 - I didn't expect this coming.

1616
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,940
- People do wonder about this.
 - That's right.

1617
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,910
- They actually come and ask me.
 - They do.

1618
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:43,440
- I have to say...
 - He's very playful.

1619
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,840
If he had the fighting skills, he would've been more evil than me.

1620
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,640
He would have. Yes.

1621
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,810
- That's why no one has it all.
 - Right.

1622
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,940
- That's right.
 - That's why I can't fight.

1623
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,040
I demonstrated Kwang Soo's water-proof phone for him today.

1624
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,340
- Do you have the footage?
 - I have it.

1625
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,540
- I took the video of it.
 - Did you take the footage?

1626
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,140
This is how he teases people in the waiting room.

1627
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,440
- Look at this.
 - Try it.

1628
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,130
- It isn't water-proof! Wait!
 - Look.

1629
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,440
- Don't worry, Kwang Soo!
 - That's funny.

1630
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,640
He didn't do anything at the back. Is this part water-proof too?

1631
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,040
I said it's all right!

1632
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,840
No, wait! It's not water-proof!

1633
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,240
I said wait!

1634
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,020
Stop it!

1635
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,040
I told you it's water-proof! Trust me!

1636
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,710
- Not the back side, though.
 - I said it's going to be fine.

1637
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,310
- Kwang Soo.
 - It's water-proof anyway.

1638
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:30,440
- Kwang Soo.
 - It's water-proof.

1639
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,610
- Hey.
 - Kwang Soo.

1640
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:34,140
- It's water-proof.
 - This isn't.

1641
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,840
You are Kwang Soo, and it's water proof.

1642
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,440
- He says it's water-proof.
 - It's not!

1643
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,327
(Although Kwang Soo was teased, his mobile phone was okay.)

1644
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:44,140
He is too playful.

1645
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,940
- A classic joker.
 - He's so naughty.

1646
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:50,340
- I am...
 - Both are heavily playful.

1647
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,640
- They are differently playful.
 - They are different.

1648
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,840
I think Kwang Soo would know well. How are we different?

1649
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,620
I would have beaten both of you hard if you were younger than me.

1650
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:04,020
(He would have hit them hard first.)

1651
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,320
I want to be older than them for once in the next life.

1652
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,110
Just once is enough.

1653
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,440
- I've never beaten by younger ones.
 - I wish I were older than them.

1654
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,540
As many viewers are curious, we should answer their question.

1655
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,140
- How do we do it?
 - There's a way.

1656
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,640
- We will begin from step one.
 - Okay.

1657
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,540
- Let's hear from the members...
 - That's right.

1658
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,140
- about you first.
 - Okay.

1659
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,940
His weakness is that he is such a perfectionist.

1660
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,340
- His weakness is...
 - He knows his weakness.

1661
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,140
that he's such a perfectionist.

1662
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,040
- It makes people around him tired.
 - It's a bit tiring.

1663
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,740
- That's right.
 - That happens.

1664
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,340
I can be late sometimes, but I get nervous when I'm 10 minutes late.

1665
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,640
(He becomes nervous because of Jae Seok.)

1666
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,040
I'm nervous if my manager takes the blame instead.

1667
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,630
Have you ever not picked up his call on purpose?

1668
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,840
- I have.
 - He has!

1669
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,230
(I have.)

1670
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:49,440
At first.

1671
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,540
I didn't pick up because I knew what he was going to say.

1672
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,810
- I see.
 - This is so funny.

1673
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:57,240
I want to see him late at least once.

1674
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,540
He was never late for the last six years.

1675
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,610
- Not at all.
 - Right.

1676
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,840
- He's a born nice person.
 - Right.

1677
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,810
- Right.
 - But he's too obsessive.

1678
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,040
(He's an obsessive perfectionist.)

1679
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,910
I'm serious.

1680
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:12,540
Once, Jae Seok, Kwang Soo and I practised for the overseas concert.

1681
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,610
We did.

1682
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,740
I think we practised for about 300 times.

1683
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,940
- He was so lazy, though!
 - Seriously.

1684
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,640
I couldn't tell him that it was enough and I wanted to rest...

1685
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,393
when he asked me to practise more.

1686
01:05:24,393 --> 01:05:26,410
I just had to follow him.

1687
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,640
I don't even remember how many times we practised.

1688
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,740
(They practised to perform for the foreign fans.)

1689
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,940
Even after we arrived there he wanted to practise.

1690
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,740
Three of us danced in the hotel room even before we went to bed.

1691
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,840
- We danced and did this.
 - Never ending practise.

1692
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,127
I fully memorise it. I can even do it in my sleep.

1693
01:05:45,127 --> 01:05:47,610
We practised so much.

1694
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,740
I think Kwang Soo has a lot to say.

1695
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,140
- I do.
 - Go ahead.

1696
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,840
- Let's hear him.
 - Do it.

1697
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,640
I want him to stop giving me advise about my relationships.

1698
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,040
- That means he's concerned.
 - Stop it, really.

1699
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,240
- Don't if you can't make it better.
 - It was going so well.

1700
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,610
- He ruined it all.
 - I really need to say about this.

1701
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:10,140
As I said before, it wasn't going to happen anyway.

1702
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,740
- Telling her your feeling wasn't...
 - No!

1703
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,140
- going to affect the result.
 - It's because he's...

1704
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,740
- such a good man.
 - Saying it affects the result.

1705
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,040
He didn't want you to get hurt.

1706
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,240
- That's right!
 - Right!

1707
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,630
But why is he so happy when I get dumped?

1708
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,340
I have one complaint about him.

1709
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,140
I want him to take care of his health.

1710
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,340
Gosh, he's the worst!

1711
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,110
- Why?
 - Goodness.

1712
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:35,340
- That's not right.
 - You are supposed to come after me!

1713
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,140
- I should praise him first!
 - I did it first...

1714
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,040
- before you on purpose.
 - Calm down.

1715
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,240
- It's all right.
 - Jae Seok, take care of your body.

1716
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,640
- Stop being nice to people.
 - And I...

1717
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,640
- Your body isn't yours.
 - Think of yourself too!

1718
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,240
- It belongs to Korea.
 - We fight in the show,

1719
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,810
- I love you.
 - but I have to say he is flawless!

1720
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,993
- Stop it already.
 - What is with you?

1721
01:06:55,993 --> 01:06:58,210
(Embarrassed)

1722
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,640
- You shouldn't do that.
 - He's so...

1723
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,440
- Okay, quiet down.
 - I can't find any of his weakness.

1724
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,540
(It's flatterers versus accusers.)

1725
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,940
He supported me financially when I moved my workroom.

1726
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,440
- Really?
 - Really?

1727
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,003
How dare you tell such a story with your legs twisted?

1728
01:07:12,003 --> 01:07:14,920
(It's so rude to twist legs when telling such a story.)

1729
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,940
(Flinching)

1730
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,840
From where I see it, You are a rubbish!

1731
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,040
(From where I see it, You are a rubbish!)

1732
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,540
You're the worst!

1733
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,640
Jae Seok is such a nice person, and Haha is a scum.

1734
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,840
- He's a rubbish.
 - Gary...

1735
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,640
- Gary, calm down.
 - Come outside!

1736
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,940
- Calm down, Gary!
 - Goodness.

1737
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,810
- I'm so furious.
 - Drink some water.

1738
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:38,840
I twisted my legs because my back hurt. So what?

1739
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,510
I was trying to sit up.

1740
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,140
("Six Witnesses" is over.)

1741
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,710
There are some people...

1742
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,710
who know about him better than us.

1743
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,310
- We invited the people around him.
 - Oh, really?

1744
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,940
- They work with him.
 - Let's hear them.

1745
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,310
- We have three of them here.
 - Will they talk about him?

1746
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,340
- Are they here?
 - Yes.

1747
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,310
- Is that right?
 - Their voices will be altered.

1748
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,210
They should be careful with the way they speak.

1749
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,240
- Are they really close to me?
 - The second stage.

1750
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,440
It's "Inside Men".

1751
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,610
- "Inside Men"?
 - I wonder who they are.

1752
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,610
- Are they really close to him?
 - Is his manager here?

1753
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,210
- Yes, they are.
 - Really?

1754
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,640
(Jae Seok seems nervous.)

1755
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:12,217
Who will they be? Who are they?

1756
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:16,510
(3 informants are sitting behind the veil.)

1757
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,450
(Who will they be?)

1758
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,710
That's obviously Kwon Ryeol in the middle.

1759
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,340
Hey, turn around or something.

1760
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,810
- That's Kwon Ryeol.
 - Turn around.

1761
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,010
They're Kwon Ryeol, Cheol Min and Jong Yoon.

1762
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,910
- That's his manager.
 - That's the manager.

1763
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:32,210
That's my manager, Jong Yoon.

1764
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,810
- That's too obvious.
 - That's too easy.

1765
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,610
Let's start today's "Silhouette Talk".

1766
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,410
I know who they are.

1767
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,950
It's producer Jeong Cheol Min,

1768
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,810
cameraman Yoo Kwon Ryeol...

1769
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,510
and manager Lim Jong Yoon.

1770
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,710
- Just be honest.
 - Right.

1771
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,510
I'm sure all of you have a lot to talk about.

1772
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,310
Let's start with this question.

1773
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,510
Is Jae Seok really a nice person?

1774
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,250
Please be honest.

1775
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:57,140
Yes, Jae Seok is a nice person, but...

1776
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,710
- Okay.
 - "But".

1777
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:02,040
Last week or the week before,

1778
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,010
we had an unusually high viewer ratings.

1779
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,240
(He was excited to see the higher ratings.)

1780
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:11,410
I texted him that I'm happy about the result with the graph.

1781
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,450
Okay.

1782
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,710
I expected him to say something like, "Well done."

1783
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:16,950
- Of course.
 - He didn't?

1784
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,510
You deserved the compliment.

1785
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,910
He called me as soon as he read my text.

1786
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:21,950
What did he say?

1787
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,510
He started pointing out which parts could have been better.

1788
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,510
(He started pointing out which parts could have been better.)

1789
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,290
Without any compliments?

1790
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,840
- Is that true?
 - I mean...

1791
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,710
- What's so wrong about it?
 - Hear him out.

1792
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,340
"Shouldn't we have filmed this part this way?"

1793
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,410
"Shouldn't this part have been edited that way?"

1794
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,450
- I'm sorry.
 - I thought,

1795
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,140
- "He's professional. He's amazing."
 - Are you sure?

1796
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,510
He called me again five minutes later.

1797
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,240
- Five minutes later?
 - Again?

1798
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,510
"I do think that part should have been that way."

1799
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,110
(He called again to point it out again.)

1800
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,950
- Again?
 - That's too much.

1801
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,450
- Just five minutes later?
 - Yes, I did say that.

1802
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,710
- Sit down.
 - Calm down.

1803
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,640
- I did say that.
 - Be quiet.

1804
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,810
- He repeated the same thing.
 - Seriously.

1805
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,510
- How did you feel?
 - Goodness.

1806
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,290
"He's making me sick."

1807
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,750
I thought, "He is a scary man."

1808
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,640
- But...
 - Yes.

1809
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,310
One day, he wanted to meet me around his house,

1810
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,950
so I went to see him.

1811
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,310
Did he tell you to come?

1812
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,840
- What did he talk about?
 - He told you to come over?

1813
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,710
- Around his house?
 - He said, "I just want to..."

1814
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,040
- "have a chat with you."
 - I see.

1815
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,010
It ended up as a five-hour discussion.

1816
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,210
Five hours?

1817
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,810
(He thought he was going crazy.)

1818
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,840
- That's too much.
 - We talked for five hours.

1819
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,340
Say something to Cheol Min. Call his name.

1820
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,750
Cheol Min, I'm sorry.

1821
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,340
I'm not Cheol Min.

1822
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,510
- Stop it.
 - All right.

1823
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,510
- Please tell him I'm sorry.
 - Okay.

1824
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:42,040
- Let's hear from Kwon Ryeol.
 - Okay.

1825
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,493
- Kwon Ryeol, say something.
 - What do you think of him?

1826
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:46,450
Mr Yu Jae Seok is...

1827
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,380
- He sounds so polite.
 - a nice person.

1828
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,729
- He is.
 - He is a really nice person,

1829
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:56,140
but as a cameraman, I often have to run around next to him.

1830
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:59,293
When Jong Kook pops up out of nowhere,

1831
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:01,110
who wouldn't be surprised?

1832
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,510
- Who wouldn't be scared?
 - What did he say?

1833
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,610
- But he always gets upset about it.
 - About you being scared.

1834
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,040
- What can I do?
 - He got me into so many troubles.

1835
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,140
- That's true.
 - You're right.

1836
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,011
What can he do, though?

1837
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:14,610
(When Jae Seok is surprised, Kwon Ryeol is even more surprised.)

1838
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,503
Why are you more surprised than me?

1839
01:11:16,503 --> 01:11:18,110
(It is scary.)

1840
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,810
- Gosh.
 - Why?

1841
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,840
(Kwon Ryeol gives up shooting and runs away.)

1842
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,110
Why did you run away?

1843
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:32,340
(He even tripped over Jae Seok.)

1844
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,810
What are you doing?

1845
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,610
You can't help being startled.

1846
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:38,610
- That's right.
 - Right.

1847
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,040
He runs away instead of filming me.

1848
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:46,203
Sometimes, Jae Seok turns back all of a sudden.

1849
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,410
- He bumps into the camera.
 - Right.

1850
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:49,840
Then he gets angry at me.

1851
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,603
(He gets angry at me.)

1852
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:53,240
It's his fault.

1853
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,340
What is that?

1854
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,310
- Gosh.
 - It was his fault.

1855
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,340
- I'm getting angry too.
 - Kwon Ryeol sounds angry.

1856
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,450
- I'm getting angry too.
 - He must be angry.

1857
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,640
He should have stepped back.

1858
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,510
(Bumping)

1859
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,910
What are you doing?

1860
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,450
(Jae Seok walked into the camera.)

1861
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,340
What are you doing?

1862
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:17,510
- He can't predict where you'll go.
 - Should I turn on a blinker?

1863
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,810
- What do you expect me to do?
 - How would he know?

1864
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,450
I can't carry around a light on my back, you know?

1865
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,040
- Kwon Ryeol, continue.
 - He was doing his best.

1866
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,040
Tell us everything.

1867
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,640
When we have female guests,

1868
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,000
he suddenly becomes so sensitive...

1869
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,017
and tells me off for focusing too much on them.

1870
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:34,837
He does focus on them too much.

1871
01:12:34,837 --> 01:12:37,340
- It is true.
 - You really do that.

1872
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,240
- When we have female guests,
 - I just happened to be near them.

1873
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,280
That's why I was filming them.

1874
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,810
He scolded me for focusing too much on them.

1875
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,510
You tend to have your mouth open while filming them.

1876
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,840
That's true.

1877
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,340
What's so wrong about smiling when I'm happy?

1878
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,840
- He doesn't let you smile?
 - That's too much.

1879
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,040
Am I not allowed to smile? We're doing a variety show.

1880
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,040
- We're supposed to be happy.
 - He turns his camera away from me.

1881
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,640
- It's a variety show.
 - Why can't he smile?

1882
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,950
I can't wait to hear from the last person.

1883
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,840
- Jong Yoon.
 - He worked for seven months.

1884
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,984
Is Jae Seok really a nice person?

1885
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,840
- Do you think so?
 - It's not been so long.

1886
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,210
Have you ever been disappointed in him?

1887
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:10,910
(Let's watch a candid shot of Jae Seok.)

1888
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,710
Jae Seok is...

1889
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:13,840
(Let's watch a candid shot of Jae Seok.)

1890
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,710
(In front of Jae Seok's apartment a few days ago)

1891
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:18,610
Please look as natural as you can.

1892
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,840
I'll try to act naturally.

1893
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,410
Can you keep my face out of the screen?

1894
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:25,710
We'll make sure to hide your identity.

1895
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,583
- Thank you.
 - Your face will be kept out.

1896
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:31,950
(Cameras are installed in the car.)

1897
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:35,810
(The cameras are securely hidden.)

1898
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:39,610
(He's trying to hide his face.)

1899
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,950
(Jae Seok appeared.)

1900
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,110
(Jae Seok is completely unaware.)

1901
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,810
(He has a programme to shoot.)

1902
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,240
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.

1903
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,810
(The secret observation starts.)

1904
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:02,450
(He puts on his seat belt as soon as he gets in the car.)

1905
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,040
Where's my script?

1906
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,510
(He looks for his script.)

1907
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,140
(The script is here.)

1908
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,010
- Jong Yoon.
 - Yes.

1909
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,140
(Focused)

1910
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,010
- Did you have breakfast?
 - Yes, I did.

1911
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:26,710
(He's totally focused on reading his script.)

1912
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
Why did you come out early today?

1913
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,310
I saw you waiting outside.

1914
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:40,383
(He looks very serious unlike in the show.)

1915
01:14:40,383 --> 01:14:43,710
(He doesn't take his eyes off the script.)

1916
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,140
I have worries these days.

1917
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,010
(He's too focused to answer back.)

1918
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:53,410
I want to work, but I want to see my girlfriend too. What should I do?

1919
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,950
Quit and see your girlfriend often.

1920
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,840
(Quit and see your girlfriend often.)

1921
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,250
But I want to work as well.

1922
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,750
Then work hard.

1923
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,640
What if I want to see my girlfriend as well?

1924
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,340
(Sighing)

1925
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,250
(He goes back to reading his script.)

1926
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,840
(All of a sudden...)

1927
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,010
Work hard, and do your best for your girlfriend.

1928
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,226
That's it.

1929
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:20,610
You're using work as an excuse.

1930
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,810
(You're using work as an excuse.)

1931
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,140
Okay.

1932
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,040
(Back to reading script again)

1933
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,710
- Be nice to her.
 - Okay.

1934
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,840
(After a short piece of advice,)

1935
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,410
(he continues reading the script.)

1936
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:39,410
(As he's too focused,)

1937
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:44,610
(the manager can't distract him any more.)

1938
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:49,110
(They arrive at the broadcasting station.)

1939
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:54,750
(This was all we could get from the secret camera.)

1940
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,750
I have a question.

1941
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:59,750
Before you started working for Jae Seok,

1942
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,937
you must have imagined about him.

1943
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:05,310
How was he different from your imagination?

1944
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,910
I thought he would be really nice,

1945
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,583
but he's kind of picky.

1946
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:14,510
(He's kind of picky.)

1947
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:16,710
He's a picky person.

1948
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,710
There you go!

1949
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:21,410
- Now, we're talking.
 - Go on.

1950
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,710
- Now, you're talking.
 - Continue.

1951
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,610
It's nothing serious.

1952
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,810
Well...

1953
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,340
Jae Seok doesn't drink coffee.

1954
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,710
- That's right.
 - He doesn't.

1955
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,950
- For his throat.
 - One coffee shop...

1956
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,840
- sells mango banana juice.
 - I see.

1957
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,750
Jae Seok wants it...

1958
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:41,810
without mango, and the milk should be low-fat.

1959
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:42,950
(Mango banana juice without mango?)

1960
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,210
He's worse than me.

1961
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:46,240
He's so picky.

1962
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,340
The milk should be low-fat?

1963
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,240
He's pickier than me.

1964
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,610
It should be without mango, and the milk should be low-fat.

1965
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,310
(No one expected this.)

1966
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,510
I'm sorry. I thought it was on the menu.

1967
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,840
- And?
 - Is there anything else?

1968
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,210
(Another disclosure)

1969
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,040
While driving,

1970
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,630
a lot of managers...

1971
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,810
listen to music.

1972
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:06,410
(A lot of other managers listen to music while driving.)

1973
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,450
But I can't.

1974
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,750
- Why?
 - Why?

1975
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,540
Although Jae Seok loves music,

1976
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,810
I was informed that he doesn't want it to be noisy in his car.

1977
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,410
- Why is he so picky?
 - Who told you that?

1978
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,510
Why is that?

1979
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,840
- That's not true.
 - Who told you that?

1980
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,140
- On the way,
 - Goodness.

1981
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:30,310
I usually read scripts or newspaper. That must be why someone said that.

1982
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:34,627
But when I see him in the rear-view mirror,

1983
01:17:34,627 --> 01:17:38,410
he's listening to music loudly with earphones.

1984
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:39,640
Alone?

1985
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,040
- I listen to it alone.
 - Alone?

1986
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,810
I wish we listen to it together.

1987
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,240
- It's because he...
 - Okay. I will plug you in too.

1988
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,410
- Wait.
 - I will plug you in when you drive.

1989
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,540
- Look.
 - Calm down.

1990
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,340
By the way, Jong Yoon, will you be all right?

1991
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,610
I don't think I will be able to go home.

1992
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,710
- Yes.
 - It's your last day, right?

1993
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,410
You ride in the back today, Jong Yoon.

1994
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:57,610
(He's clenching his teeth.)

1995
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,750
- I will drop you at your place.
 - Goodness.

1996
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,380
- He will play a song for you too.
 - Yes, I will play a song for you.

1997
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:05,250
Now, you can listen to whichever song you want to listen to.

1998
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,640
I wonder...

1999
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,610
what is the good for us...

2000
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,210
to do this.

2001
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:12,340
(What good does it do to them?)

2002
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:15,040
(After the exposure, he tries to save himself.)

2003
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,610
- All of a sudden.
 - I'll be uncomfortable around him.

2004
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,610
- What will I do now?
 - Jong Yoon.

2005
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:21,921
I will tell you what remains between us now. Bitter feelings.

2006
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:23,750
Only bitter feelings remain between us.

2007
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,040
We are at war now!

2008
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,040
(He's upset.)

2009
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,950
You betrayers! We are at war now!

2010
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,580
- Goodness.
 - Okay.

2011
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,340
- Okay.
 - I have something to say.

2012
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,840
- Jong Yoon.
 - He's very brave.

2013
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,710
- Lastly...
 - He's very brave.

2014
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,040
I never knew he was like that.

2015
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,210
- Jae Seok.
 - Yes.

2016
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,340
I like you.

2017
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,810
(He tries to win Jae Seok's favour again.)

2018
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,950
- What's that?
 - I like you too.

2019
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,340
- I love you.
 - It's too late!

2020
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,510
- I really love you.
 - Goodness!

2021
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,710
- Hey!
 - Jae Seok!

2022
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:52,140
(The second stage ends as it remains bitter feelings.)

2023
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:54,250
(Running Man Q and A)

2024
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,810
Let's move on to the third stage.

2025
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,810
- Is there a third stage?
 - This is the last stage.

2026
01:18:58,810 --> 01:18:59,840
- What is it?
 - This is good.

2027
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,610
It's a known fact that Jae Seok remembers...

2028
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:04,340
- the staff's names well.
 - Right.

2029
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,450
That's how attentive he is.

2030
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,310
- But now...
 - What's the question?

2031
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,410
"Does he remember the names of all the staff?"

2032
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,750
He will pick 5 of the 50 names in the box.

2033
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,040
He has to put the name tags on the right people.

2034
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,640
- Did you say 5?
 - Yes, 5.

2035
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,950
If you get it wrong, you will be punished.

2036
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,450
- So please make a careful choice.
 - Okay.

2037
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:24,710
I am very curious about how it will turn out.

2038
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,840
- I think he knows everyone.
 - This is a nice one.

2039
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,840
So he will pick the names and take them to the right people.

2040
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,210
Choose five cards.

2041
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,310
They're all wearing blank name tags.

2042
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,710
- They are.
 - That's where you stick them.

2043
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:39,210
Does Jae Seok know all their names?

2044
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,610
This is nerve-wrecking.

2045
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,610
What's for sure is that I don't know everyone's name.

2046
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,340
Even though you don't know everyone's name,

2047
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,510
- All right.
 - "Ko Eun Mi".

2048
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,610
He's lucky.

2049
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:48,840
Eun Mi?

2050
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,510
That sounds very familiar.

2051
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,140
- But not the full name.
 - I've heard it a lot too.

2052
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,810
Same here. It sounds new with the last name.

2053
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:56,510
- Eun Mi sounds familiar.
 - We know who Eun Mi is.

2054
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,610
All right. "Jo Seong Oh".

2055
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:01,040
It's my first time hearing this name.

2056
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,840
(Second person is Jo Seong Oh, in charge of filming Gary.)

2057
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,040
- "Park Soo Yeon".
 - "Park Soo Yeon".

2058
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,950
This is crazy. It's my first time hearing this name.

2059
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,240
- Yong Woo.
 - It's Yong Woo.

2060
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,410
I know Yong Woo.

2061
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,110
- Gyu Ho?
 - Gyu Ho?

2062
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,840
- Do we have such a person?
 - We have Gyu Ho?

2063
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
- Give it a try.
 - I'm going to Yong Woo first.

2064
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,831
- Yong Woo.
 - I will go to Yong Woo first.

2065
01:20:17,831 --> 01:20:19,140
Yong Woo is right here.

2066
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,640
- You can't avoid him.
 - I know him.

2067
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,484
- It's confusing with last names.
 - Right?

2068
01:20:24,484 --> 01:20:26,750
- You can't avoid him.
 - I know you, of course.

2069
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,040
Yong Woo is...

2070
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,510
(He looks at his face again.)

2071
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,226
I knew it.

2072
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,710
He's one of the producers.

2073
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,810
He's Producer Park Yong Woo.

2074
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,040
- I'm worried about the rest.
 - Who's Soo Yeon?

2075
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,340
Soo Yeon, Eun Mi...

2076
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,710
(He has to find Eun Mi, Soo Yeon, Seong Oh and Gyu Ho.)

2077
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:42,410
They are not here. I know you all.

2078
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,540
(Why did he have to choose tricky ones?)

2079
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,140
Come on.

2080
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:48,040
- Aren't you Soo Yeon?
 - If you are, please blink.

2081
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,410
- Wait.
 - Jae Seok.

2082
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,710
There is one here too.

2083
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:53,140
- Come over here.
 - It's either her or...

2084
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,510
Soo Yeon...

2085
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,290
They are Sin Hye and Mi Yeon.

2086
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,100
Soo Yeon is... Wait.

2087
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,310
Jae Seok.

2088
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:03,410
(Is Soo Yeon one of them?)

2089
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:06,239
Soo Yeon... Well...

2090
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,210
- Soo Yeon is over there.
 - None of them is Soo Yeon.

2091
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,310
- Wait.
 - Oh, Soo Yeon.

2092
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,340
Soo Yeon!

2093
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,450
(He finds a girl who is suspected to be Soo Yeon.)

2094
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,710
- Is it her?
 - Soo Yeon!

2095
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,510
- Is she the one?
 - She's Soo Yeon.

2096
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,117
- Wait, is she Soo Yeon?
 - She is.

2097
01:21:18,117 --> 01:21:19,510
- You are Soo Yeon, right?
 - She is.

2098
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,710
- Soo Yeon.
 - Show your face.

2099
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,210
Don't try to look pretty.

2100
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,817
Are you Park Soo Yeon?

2101
01:21:24,817 --> 01:21:27,110
- Is she Soo Yeon?
 - Is your last name Park?

2102
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,950
- Leave her alone.
 - I think she is Soo Yeon.

2103
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,250
- In 1, 2 and 3.
 - Wait.

2104
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,950
(He will receive an unbelievable punishment if he fails.)

2105
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,810
(What is...)

2106
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:40,840
(your name?)

2107
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,140
I think they will shoot you with a water gun.

2108
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,203
- Oh, dear.
 - It's Hyo Im.

2109
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:45,410
(He gets shot with water guns.)

2110
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,540
- It was Hyo Im.
 - It wasn't her.

2111
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,610
- It's not her.
 - I am sorry, Hyo Im.

2112
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,510
- It's okay.
 - No, she's...

2113
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,810
You're Soo Yeon, right?

2114
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,510
I told you.

2115
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,840
- You should've given it to her.
 - Gosh.

2116
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,040
Yes.

2117
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,340
(He missed the youngest scriptwriter's name.)

2118
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,226
She is Soo Yeon.

2119
01:22:01,226 --> 01:22:02,610
- She's the scriptwriter.
 - The scriptwriter.

2120
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,710
You are new, aren't you?

2121
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,610
- She's not new.
 - I told you.

2122
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:07,410
- She's been here for a while.
 - She's been working.

2123
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,140
She always puts us on standby.

2124
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,610
- Really?
 - Yes.

2125
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:12,710
- Eun Mi sounds familiar.
 - I have that feeling.

2126
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,840
- Eun Mi sounds familiar.
 - Eun Mi does sound familiar.

2127
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,810
I'm not sure about Gyu Ho, though.

2128
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,680
- It's my first time hearing it.
 - Same here.

2129
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,510
- I have a friend named Gyu Ho.
 - Gyu Ho is my friend's name.

2130
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:23,040
I think the guy over there is moving like Gyu Ho.

2131
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,117
I can't help it.

2132
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:27,540
I will just find a person that looks like Gyu Ho.

2133
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,210
Over there.

2134
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,810
- I think he's one of them.
 - Isn't this...

2135
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:32,840
- Check over there.
 - fascinating?

2136
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,710
- Over there.
 - I'll find someone that looks...

2137
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,210
like Gyu Ho.

2138
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,540
- Someone must look like Gyu Ho.
 - On the right side.

2139
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,840
Gyu Ho.

2140
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,440
Hey, Gyu Ho!

2141
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,240
It's been a while!

2142
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,510
(He picks a random staff.)

2143
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:46,140
- Gyu Ho!
 - Is he looking for an old friend?

2144
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,340
- We've known for...
 - What's that?

2145
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,710
- What if he's not the one?
 - Look at him.

2146
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,020
You are not Gyu Ho, are you? Your face turned red.

2147
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,810
His face is too red. That means it's not his name.

2148
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,840
(He leaves without any hesitation.)

2149
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,250
Gyu Ho!

2150
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,383
You are Gyu Ho.

2151
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:00,910
You are Gyu Ho, aren't you?

2152
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,750
Jae Seok.

2153
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,367
Give it a go.

2154
01:23:04,367 --> 01:23:06,210
- Give it a go.
 - His face...

2155
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,610
doesn't change at all.

2156
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,140
- He's always like that.
 - Give it a go.

2157
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,040
You're always with Haha, aren't you?

2158
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,340
- Yes.
 - I didn't really get to...

2159
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,840
work with Gyu Ho. Right?

2160
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,610
- Yes, right.
 - So you are Gyu Ho.

2161
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:18,010
(It's Gyu Ho.)

2162
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,583
Are you stupid?

2163
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:22,610
- He is Gyu Ho.
 - You are such an idiot.

2164
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,610
- That's bad.
 - That's really bad.

2165
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,710
(If he can't remember it, he makes a smart guess.)

2166
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,140
Gyu Ho!

2167
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,810
- Jae Seok is smart.
 - Hello.

2168
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,580
- I know.
 - Gyu Ho knows me.

2169
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:31,810
I know Gyu Ho.

2170
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,236
- Now, I have to find Eun Mi.
 - Eun Mi and Seong Oh remain.

2171
01:23:34,236 --> 01:23:36,710
- I heard she's in the audio team.
 - Actually, we don't know them.

2172
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,710
- We don't get to talk to them.
 - Right.

2173
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:39,810
- We don't know.
 - There aren't that many.

2174
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:43,040
I know a girl who looks like Eun Mi.

2175
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,603
Eun Mi.

2176
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,750
Eun Mi. You are not Eun Mi.

2177
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,950
You are not Eun Mi.

2178
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,810
Jae Seok, you are really unlucky.

2179
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:53,040
At the critical moment, he's very unlucky.

2180
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,710
Why did he pick those names among all the names he knows?

2181
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:58,210
- I know.
 - He's so unlucky.

2182
01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:59,710
Joo Hee is here.

2183
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:02,140
(Let's see.)

2184
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,729
Eun Mi!

2185
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:04,950
(He finds her.)

2186
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,610
She's here. I found her.

2187
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:07,950
- Come here, Eun Mi.
 - Did you find her?

2188
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,840
- I found her.
 - Is that right?

2189
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,950
- Eun Mi works really hard.
 - Are you sure?

2190
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,304
Really?

2191
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:14,610
Where is it?

2192
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,340
- Eun Mi.
 - What if it's not her?

2193
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,040
- I am sorry.
 - What if it's not her?

2194
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,610
When you are struggling and working hard,

2195
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,610
I never got to give you kind words. I am sorry about that.

2196
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:24,710
Eun Mi.

2197
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:27,040
(Eun Mi,)

2198
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,340
(I'm sorry for everything.)

2199
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,340
She's our producer.

2200
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,180
- She's Eun Ji.
 - She's Eun Ji.

2201
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,450
(He gets shot again.)

2202
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:38,729
- She's Eun Ji.
 - She's Eun Ji.

2203
01:24:38,729 --> 01:24:40,710
- She has the similar name.
 - You were very close.

2204
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,340
- Eun Ji is really upset.
 - She's Eun Ji.

2205
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:43,510
Eun Ji is...

2206
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,310
- Eun Ji is really upset.
 - You were too confident.

2207
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,840
(She shot him with a water gun with fury.)

2208
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,040
Where is Eun Mi? Let's see her face.

2209
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,840
- Where is Eun Mi?
 - Eun Mi!

2210
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,810
- Oh, you were there.
 - Yes!

2211
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:55,140
- You are Eun Mi.
 - How long have you been with us?

2212
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,450
You're in the wardrobe.

2213
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:58,140
- I've been here for a year.
 - It's been a year already?

2214
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,910
Kwang Soo, she's in the audio team.

2215
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,810
Really? I am sorry.

2216
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,250
(I should've kept quiet.)

2217
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:07,040
- She's Eun Mi.
 - Next is Seong Oh.

2218
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,540
- Next is Seong Oh.
 - You should know him.

2219
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,710
- Let's see.
 - Seong Oh is...

2220
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,310
- You know...
 - He's our floor director.

2221
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,410
Seong Oh is?

2222
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:14,610
(Maybe he's not.)

2223
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,710
It's known that he remembers all the assistants' names.

2224
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,040
Does he really?

2225
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,950
(He gives a hint as he coughs.)

2226
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:21,610
(His cough somehow sounds like an English word.)

2227
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,710
- Hey!
 - What was that?

2228
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:24,210
(I got it.)

2229
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:26,510
One of the cameramen here recently got married.

2230
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,290
- Gi Jin.
 - It's Seong Yong.

2231
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,100
- Seong Yong got married.
 - Seong Yong.

2232
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,610
- Congratulations.
 - I'll give you a wedding gift.

2233
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:34,110
I am sorry. I will give you a wedding gift too.

2234
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:35,880
You always work so hard.

2235
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,840
- Seong Oh.
 - Is he the one?

2236
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,340
- It must be him.
 - You work so hard too.

2237
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,450
It must be him.

2238
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,340
He's been working with us for a long time.

2239
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,750
He's my cameraman, Seong Oh.

2240
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,510
- Bingo.
 - I am really sorry.

2241
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,840
It didn't sound familiar because of your last name.

2242
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,140
(He got Seong Oh right.)

2243
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:54,510
- It's tricky with the last name.
 - It is tricky.

2244
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:58,827
They've been working with us for a long time, and we should...

2245
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:02,340
- be aware of their names at least.
 - Let's get to know them more.

2246
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,810
- We're done verifying Jae Seok.
 - He's a decent person,

2247
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,510
but he's not very good at memorising names.

2248
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,710
He's a decent man who's not good at memorising names.

2249
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:12,310
- Yes. Thank you. – Yes.

2250
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,410
(They are done with all the questions in the end.)

2251
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,540
Great.

2252
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,610
(However, the verification is not over yet.)

2253
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,140
"Who is the unluckiest?"

2254
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,750
(Who is the unluckiest?)

2255
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,950
(The most popular question)

2256
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:22,610
- Who is the unluckiest?
 - A member with the least luck.

2257
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,040
So it's a good thing to have the least luck.

2258
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,250
- Lucky seven.
 - What's this?

2259
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,083
Four!

2260
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,710
Welcome to the world of bad luck!

2261
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,040
- You?
 - You are...

2262
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,810
- Hey!
 - I broke up just yesterday.

2263
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:35,610
(The members look for the unlucky celebrities.)

2264
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,950
I resent Yu Jae Seok!

2265
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,450
(It's the battle between two unlucky people.)

2266
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:42,610
(What stops misfortune is a bigger misfortune.)

2267
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,710
Gosh...

2268
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:45,810
- Tae Hee just called me.
 - We were going to fetch you.

2269
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:48,250
Tae Hee, do you consider yourself lucky or unlucky?

2270
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,380
(Next week's special is The First Unluckiest Festival.)

2271
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:54,010
(Running Man)
