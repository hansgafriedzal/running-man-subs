1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,730
(Battle for the Centre)

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,220
(If you want to attract attention, centre is your position.)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,660
How does it feel to sit on the throne?

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,050
Don't covet for the centre seat.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,480
Get lost, all of you!

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,420
- My goodness.
 -  She can't reach.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,050
- You are good at this.
 -  One, two, one, two.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,120
You only care about yourself, don't you?

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,230
(Only the centre takes it all. Survive this cruel game today.)

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,490
I should receive a camera, at least.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,360
- One!
 -  I hope it turns off.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,330
(Battle for the Centre: The One Who Holds the Throne)

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,260
(It is unusually gloomy today.)

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,160
(Today, these seven seats hold the fate of many.)

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,750
(R Hotel in Hwaseong)

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,800
Hello.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,390
Good day.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,600
(Kwang Soo arrives first, and he sees something strange.)

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,600
What are you doing?

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,720
What are these?

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,660
(What are these?)

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,100
(There is a cameraman for every seat.)

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,880
(Startled)

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,430
That's the throne.

25
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,820
- Take a seat anywhere you want.
 -  Pardon?

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,200
Sit anywhere you want.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,350
(The centre)

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,710
Then I'll sit...

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,920
(I'll sit in the centre, of course.)

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,740
This is the seat that I want to sit on.

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,930
Shouldn't I?

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,960
Would I attract too much attention?

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,590
- Hello, Gary.
 -  Hello. Why are you sitting there?

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,120
You can sit anywhere you want.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,860
- Can I sit anywhere I want?
 -  Yes.

36
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,630
That's the worst position.

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,520
- You'll see how things turn out.
 -  Can I change seats?

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,720
- That's the worst position.
 -  Can I change now?

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,830
I can, right?

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,650
You must sit there. You can't change seats now.

41
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,050
No, I was not certain and haven't made up my mind yet.

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,650
(How will this change the fate of Kwang Soo?)

43
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,080
- The weather's great today.
 -  Hello. You're here.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,220
(The throne is empty.)

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,730
- Are the seats all separated?
 -  You can sit anywhere you want.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm a side-seeker too.

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,890
(He's an extreme side-seeker.)

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,290
What's going on here?

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,290
You can take a seat anywhere you want today.

50
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,490
I'm 100 percent certain that he will sit in the centre.

51
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,990
Today's your day, Seok Jin.

52
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,450
- What do you mean?
 -  The throne is empty.

53
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,890
Can I sit on the throne?

54
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,050
- Don't worry about us.
 -  We left the seat for you.

55
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,220
- I know you're a centre-seeker.
 -  We left the seat empty for you.

56
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,190
I didn't know that I can actually sit here.

57
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,650
(Completely satisfied)

58
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,740
It's so great when everybody knows my preference and cares about it.

59
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,490
- It's so cold today. So cold.
 -  Hey, Ji Hyo.

60
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,920
Take a sit anywhere you want.

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,650
Can I sit anywhere I want?

62
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,820
(Ji Hyo sits on the third row.)

63
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,490
Here's our Mr Centre-seeker.

64
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,360
- What is this?
 -  Hello, Centre-seeker.

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,870
Why is Seok Jin sitting in the centre?

66
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,200
What's the matter? I'm sitting here because I want to.

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,150
- That's why you are sitting there?
 -  Of course.

68
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,120
- You sit anywhere you want today.
 -  I can't believe you sat there.

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,600
You know that I'm a centre-seeker.

70
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,830
- Jong Kook may try to take over.
 -  It's so free today.

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,220
- There he is.
 -  He's here.

72
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,890
- Hello.
 -  There he is.

73
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,990
(I'm here to sit in the centre.)

74
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,330
There he is. I'll pretend to be in a bad mood today.

75
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,620
What is this? Why are you sitting on a throne like a prince today?

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,790
- You sit anywhere you want.
 -  You can sit anywhere.

77
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,020
- Really?
 -  He's a centre-seeker. Seriously.

78
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,490
Really? He...

79
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,990
His centre-loving is at a level of obsession. We should be considerate.

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,950
- So should we let him sit there?
 -  Yes, of course.

81
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,510
You're almost a doctor, Jae Seok.

82
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,490
Seok Jin sitting on the throne doesn't seem right.

83
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,990
You'll only see him at the centre very briefly.

84
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,420
That's right. That makes sense.

85
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,920
(Enjoy while you can.)

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,860
I'll try really hard today.

87
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,890
We talked about a side-seeker, Gary, and a centre-seeker, Jae Seok.

88
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,100
- Yes.
 -  Yes.

89
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,550
(Last week...)

90
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,490
Je Hoon is the guest for today, but you're sitting in the centre.

91
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,650
- You love the centre seat so much.
 -  I sat here unconsciously.

92
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,890
Is the centre seat that important? Je Hoon, sit here.

93
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,150
I must be out of my mind.

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,990
- I'm sitting in the centre.
 -  No, you don't have to.

95
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,490
(Jae Seok sat in the centre as well.)

96
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,350
- He's a centre-seeker.
 -  Are you mad?

97
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,950
- What did you say?
 -  You're a centre-seeker.

98
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,760
- A centre-seeker?
 -  I know I am a side-seeker.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,990
(We identified side-seekers and centre-seekers.)

100
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,420
We were inspired by the idea,

101
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,220
and we counted how many times each member stood in the centre...

102
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,890
- and made up a list.
 -  Really?

103
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,420
- I wonder what the outcome is.
 -  I never stood in the centre.

104
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,590
Because Seok Jin is sitting in the centre today,

105
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,160
- you'll be the host for now.
 -  Okay.

106
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,090
- No way.
 -  I've been waiting for this.

107
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,920
- What is this?
 -  I've been waiting for this chance.

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,410
Don't make this show too old-fashioned.

109
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,920
Old-fashioned.

110
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
All right.

111
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,990
Keep your mouth closed, Jong Kook.

112
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,250
Jae Seok, you'd better keep quiet, too. Don't interrupt in the middle.

113
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,060
Seok Jin runs the show like in the late 90's.

114
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,120
Hold it properly. Gosh.

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
- Loot at that.
 -  Gosh.

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,620
(The weather isn't helping.)

117
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,750
Gosh. What are you doing?

118
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,890
- The wind is too strong.
 -  What are you doing?

119
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,750
- I'll hold it like this.
 -  Yes. Grab tightly.

120
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,090
- Is that correct?
 -  Gary stood in the centre often.

121
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,100
Are you running this show or having a conversation?

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,030
Hey. Hold it.

123
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
(The board must dislike Seok Jin.)

124
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,000
- Hey!
 -  Wait. I'll hold it like this.

125
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,940
- What are you doing?
 -  He's doing well.

126
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,890
- Sit Jae Seok. Sit.
 -  Okay.

127
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,090
I actually stood in the centre so many times.

128
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,230
- You're right.
 -  Really?

129
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,350
Don't walk, but run. Welcome to Running Man.

130
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,120
(For the last 6 years, 298 episodes of Running Man was aired.)

131
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,790
(Who stood in the centre the most for the last six years?)

132
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,350
- That's close.
 -  That's a lot.

133
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,660
Yu Jae Seok stood in the centre for 109 times.

134
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,520
- Wow, 109 times.
 -  That's right, 109 times.

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,290
Followed by Kim Jong Kook, who stood in the centre for 38 times.

136
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,990
Gary stood in the centre for 19 times.

137
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,550
- Gary was in the centre 19 times?
 -  It must be by coincidences.

138
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,120
Gary stood in the centre for many times than I expected.

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,650
- Is the fourth row the last row?
 -  Yes.

140
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,330
- That's where side-seekers stand.
 -  That's the outskirts.

141
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,200
Haha stood on the side for 144 times.

142
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,190
- Kwang Soo stood for 161 times.
 -  Kwang Soo had to.

143
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,290
- Yes, he had to.
 -  He's too tall.

144
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,250
- It's because he's too tall.
 -  Yes. He had no choice.

145
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,600
- Kwang Soo had too.
 -  I see.

146
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,090
- There are flowers.
 -  You only see them now?

147
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,880
- That's a flower carpet.
 -  What is that?

148
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,020
(A flower carpet is laid down all of a sudden.)

149
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,290
- That's a flower carpet. Literally.
 -  I have high hopes for the guests.

150
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,890
Why is the carpet laid down toward Seok Jin?

151
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,490
There are supporters to help you...

152
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,620
- with your fight for the centre.
 -  Really?

153
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,720
Please go on, Seok Jin. Introduce us the guests today.

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,420
So Seok Jin is responsible for the ratings for this episode...

155
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,550
- even if the ratings drop?
 -  Of course. You can count on me.

156
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,130
She once said that,

157
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,890
- "Give the centre position..."
 -  No.

158
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,010
- "to Seok Jin."
 -  This is so boring.

159
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,620
She's a beloved actress with her fresh and lively charms.

160
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,690
Here is the actress, Cho Bo Ah.

161
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,920
(Seok Jin's supporter is Cho Bo Ah.)

162
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,160
- Really?
 -  Cho Bo Ah?

163
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,800
- Wow. Cho Bo Ah!
 -  Oh, my.

164
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,220
- Really?
 -  Cho Bo Ah?

165
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,050
(She looks so lively and charming even from far.)

166
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,960
We have a great guest today.

167
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,750
(Cho Bo Ah)

168
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,030
Say hello.

169
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,690
I want to marry him.

170
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,830
(She makes men's heart flutter with her beauty and performance.)

171
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,190
(A big umbrella and a flower carpet is for the centre supporter.)

172
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,430
- An umbrella and a flower carpet?
 -  That's so great.

173
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,920
- Nice to see you, Cho Bo Ah.
 -  Goodness.

174
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,290
- Oh, my.
 -  She's so pretty.

175
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,920
- Thank you, Seok Jin.
 -  You're welcome.

176
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,490
Go away, Jae Seok. Go away.

177
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,390
- Cho Bo Ah.
 -  Hello.

178
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,020
She's Cho Bo Ah.

179
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,250
(Bo Ah will assist Seok Jin today to make him sit in the centre.)

180
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,090
Is she here to support Seok Jin today?

181
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,190
- Ji Hyo, come here.
 -  Of course.

182
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,750
Why is she getting a penalty from the beginning?

183
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,320
This is not a penalty.

184
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,960
We should change the host!

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,820
- Resign, Seok Jin.
 -  Just sit down.

186
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,690
- Sit down.
 -  Resign. Resign.

187
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,490
- Resign.
 -  Why didn't you sit in the centre?

188
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,220
Sit down. Hurry up.

189
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,290
- All right, Kim Jong Kook.
 -  Is it my turn?

190
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,610
If Kim Jong Kook is the centre of TURBO,

191
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,490
she is the centre of all the trot scene.

192
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,190
He is commentating on his own. We can't hear him.

193
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,620
She attracts all men with her charms and cuteness.

194
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,350
- A singer, Hong Jin Young!
 -  It's Hong Jin Young.

195
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,530
It's Jin Young.

196
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,230
- Oh, it's Jin Young.
 -  It's Hong Jin Young.

197
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,930
- Come this way.
 -  Come here.

198
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,320
It's so nice to see her.

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,630
(An umbrella and a plain carpet for the second row supporter.)

200
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,530
(Hong Jin Young)

201
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,550
Why didn't they prepare you the flower carpet?

202
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,330
Nice to see you.

203
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,490
- She's Jong Kook's girl.
 -  Yes, there's definitely something.

204
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,920
Probably the only potential couple.

205
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,790
- There's something.
 -  Jong Kook is happy.

206
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,520
Sit everyone. Please sit.

207
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,690
Can't you make a big fancy introduction for Jin Young?

208
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,250
- That was so simple.
 -  How can I make it more fancy?

209
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,020
- That was too short and simple.
 -  How can I make it better?

210
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,470
- It's not fun at all.
 -  How should I do it then?

211
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,520
- Everything is being blown around.
 -  My gosh.

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,660
(The flower carpet is being blown away.)

213
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,950
(What a mess.)

214
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,610
Oh my goodness.

215
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,920
This must be a sign. This must be.

216
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,530
(This must be a sign. This must be.)

217
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,430
(It's a sign telling Seok Jin to resign.)

218
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,450
It's all because of the host.

219
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,260
- What's going on?
 -  It's because of the host.

220
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,020
- What a mess.
 -  The host is to be blamed.

221
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,150
You should change the person sitting in the centre.

222
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,820
It's time to introduce the supporter for Yu Jae Seok.

223
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
- My supporter?
 -  It's Jae Seok's partner.

224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,290
Who is it?

225
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,690
She looks tough on the outside, but soft on the inside.

226
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,290
Her unexpected charm makes many people become her fan.

227
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,520
The name of the university she attended means the centre too.

228
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,900
Actress, Yoo In Young.

229
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,700
- Wow.
 -  In Young?

230
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,620
Long time no see, In Young. She was my partner last time.

231
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,120
She was your partner last time.

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,260
- In Young.
 -  She joined us once before.

233
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,600
In Young.

234
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,630
(It's so great to see her again.)

235
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,300
- She's my partner.
 -  She's my old partner.

236
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,960
Show us your face.

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,730
(Yoo In Young)

238
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,790
(She looks cold but has an opposite character.)

239
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,720
Gosh, you ruined it.

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,890
(Actress Yoo In Young is brave.)

241
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,160
- I can see In Young's so angry.
 -  She is.

242
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,830
(Acclamation)

243
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,060
- She was on Femme Fatale Special.
 -  Hello.

244
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,050
- It's been a while.
 -  Long time no see.

245
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,520
- Here you are.
 -  Please take a seat.

246
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,540
- Wow. He'll be with us too.
 -  What is that?

247
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,400
Hey, the third row is acupressure mat.

248
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,420
- Who is it?
 -  He is the one in the centre.

249
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,900
He says he will make sure Ji Hyo gets the centre today.

250
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,850
- The centre of Block B, Zico!
 -  Zico!

251
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,960
- Zico!
 -  Zico?

252
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,360
- Really? Wow.
 -  Oh, my.

253
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,520
- Zico, take your shoes off!
 -  Zico!

254
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,930
You should take your shoes off.

255
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,250
- That's it!
 -  Good.

256
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,730
Zico is here!

257
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,920
- Zico!
 -  Look at him! He's so cool.

258
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,930
(He remains cool even when his feet hurt a lot.)

259
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,850
- Hey, Zico!
 -  Hello, I'm Seok Jin.

260
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,020
Hello, Zico!

261
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,200
- Hello.
 -  He's here.

262
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,500
- Please take a seat.
 -  I'd love to meet the next guest.

263
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,260
Kwang Soo. Get ready to welcome the next guest. You'll like her.

264
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,810
- Her favourite animal is giraffe.
 -  Isn't she Uhm Hyeon Gyeong?

265
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,890
So she's here to help Kwang Soo who looks like a giraffe.

266
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,150
- An actress, Uhm Hyeon Gyeong!
 -  Uhm Hyeon Gyeong!

267
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,610
- It's Uhm Hyeon Gyeong!
 -  It's been a while.

268
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,550
Gosh, wait.

269
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,100
(I'm here to help Kwang Soo get the centre.)

270
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,300
(Uhm Hyeon Gyeong)

271
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,360
(Hyeon Gyeong, a giraffe maniac, is a talented entertainer.)

272
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,120
- Hyeon Gyeong is so pretty.
 -  Uhm Hyeon Gyeong!

273
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,550
- I met Hyeon Gyeong on "Xman".
 -  That's a long ago.

274
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,140
Hyeon Gyeong! Come here.

275
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,960
- Why are you here, Hyeon Gyeong?
 -  Look who's here.

276
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,560
- What's this?
 -  Your hair got stuck.

277
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,420
- What's going on here?
 -  Take this.

278
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,350
- What is that now?
 -  Look! That's ice.

279
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,170
- Is that really ice?
 -  It's ice.

280
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,070
Who's next?

281
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,180
To make Haha get the spotlight, she visits us today.

282
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,750
She's 177cm tall, and her body has a perfect proportion.

283
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,910
- She transformed from a model...
 -  It's Stephanie Lee!

284
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,590
(At a loss for words)

285
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,150
- Hey.
 -  Wasn't I right?

286
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,690
I was going to say that...

287
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,390
- although I have a hoarse throat.
 -  Stephanie Lee!

288
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,720
(Haha's supporter is a model, Stephanie Lee.)

289
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,320
- The way she walks is different.
 -  Look at her umbrella!

290
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,650
- Stephanie Lee...
 -  My goodness.

291
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,300
(Stephanie Lee)

292
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,300
(Stephanie works both as a model and an actress. What a nice body!)

293
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,330
(She played a career woman role in "Yong Pal".)

294
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,820
- This is great.
 -  She has to walk on ice.

295
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,250
- That's real ice right there.
 -  Stephanie...

296
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,890
- You have big feet.
 -  Just walk fast.

297
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,820
I'm sorry. Gosh, I can't believe this.

298
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,590
- Goodness. What's this?
 -  Just walk. It's okay.

299
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,160
- Stephanie...
 -  This is too rude!

300
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,180
Goodness! Everything is messed up today.

301
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,510
- It's because Seok Jin is hosting.
 -  It's a total mess.

302
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,890
Everything is out of order.

303
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,010
It's a chaos!

304
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,250
Look at this mess. It's because Seok Jin is hosting this show!

305
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,500
- Poor Stephanie.
 -  She's trembling.

306
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,220
It's time for our next guest.

307
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,550
- She is really something!
 -  Who is it?

308
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,720
She visits us to help the side-seeker, Gary,

309
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,020
and make him a centre-seeker.

310
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,620
- It's Kyung Su Jin!
 -  She is...

311
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,200
- It's Kyung Su Jin!
 -  Kyung Su Jin!

312
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,330
Stop there!

313
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,880
- Oh, Su Jin is here.
 -  Gosh, there she is!

314
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,680
- She's Gary's favourite actress.
 -  It's Su Jin!

315
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,690
- Su Jin!
 -  Welcome!

316
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,800
- Gary really likes you.
 -  My goodness.

317
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,310
(Although she has a small body, she is very charismatic and cute.)

318
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,530
(She also appeared on Running Man as Gary's partner.)

319
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,690
What happened to your umbrella?

320
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,920
(That's because you are a side-seeker.)

321
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,650
Kwang Soo, you have to hold her hand. Hold her hand.

322
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,460
- Su Jin, I'm so sorry.
 -  We are sorry!

323
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,390
- Goodness.
 -  Oh, my.

324
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,120
- Are you okay?
 -  It's your fault, Gary.

325
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,190
- Watch out.
 -  Gary really likes Su Jin.

326
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,490
- Hello.
 -  What is this? Come on.

327
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,820
- Isn't this too much?
 -  Gary told me that...

328
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
It's Gary's fault for sitting on the fourth row.

329
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,010
- Seok Jin, please keep going.
 -  Okay.

330
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,490
- Why is there so much to do today?
 -  You going so slow.

331
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,930
All right. She's Cho Bo Ah. Please give it up for her.

332
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,320
Please give her a big hand again.

333
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,520
She arrived here a while ago.

334
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,790
- Are you interviewing her?
 -  I'll start the interviews, then.

335
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,490
Bo Ah, please introduce yourself.

336
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,720
Hello, I'm Cho Bo Ah.

337
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,920
What do you... Are you an actress?

338
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,520
(Are you an actress?)

339
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,850
- Gosh.
 -  What are you doing?

340
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,490
- That's ridiculous.
 -  Please study before you come here.

341
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,520
You should learn how to host a show.

342
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,990
I'm currently acting in the drama, "Monster".

343
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,650
- You are in the drama, "Monster".
 -  Yes.

344
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,050
Do you guys speak the same language?

345
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,620
I think it'll take two hours just to start the show.

346
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,950
- Is it your first time here?
 -  Yes.

347
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,430
- How does it feel?
 -  Is it your first time hosting?

348
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,930
Gosh, I've been doing it for 20 years.

349
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,190
- Tell us how you'll play today.
 -  My goodness.

350
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,820
- That's so weird.
 -  Isn't this the way we do it?

351
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,750
No, we no longer ask such questions.

352
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,050
- Why do you ask that?
 -  Just tell us.

353
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,220
- Please go ahead.
 -  I came here...

354
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,920
- to help Seok Jin keep the centre.
 -  Okay.

355
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,990
Oh gosh.

356
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,030
- But I'm not sure if I can.
 -  What?

357
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,520
- Of course, she's not sure.
 -  Don't worry.

358
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,750
I'll be in the centre the whole day.

359
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,820
Then, next!

360
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,120
(Then, next!)

361
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,360
- She barely said anything!
 -  Was that it?

362
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,090
- You should ask more questions!
 -  You're a bad host!

363
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,860
Please get up. The host is here.

364
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,220
- Get up.
 -  Why would you make her get up?

365
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,530
I'm older than you. Just get up.

366
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,150
- So In Young...
 -  What are you doing?

367
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,690
- You're Jae Seok's partner.
 -  Yes.

368
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,020
- How do you feel about it?
 -  He's always been at the centre.

369
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,550
So If I do my best...

370
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,320
- He can get to the centre position.
 -  Yes.

371
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,890
That won't happen today. Today is the day...

372
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,420
- Jae Seok gets a side position.
 -  Cut it out!

373
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,920
- Cut it out!
 -  Cut it out!

374
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,100
- Okay. That was it.
 -  Goodness.

375
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,450
- Are you kidding me?
 -  Get up, now.

376
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,990
- How can he do that?
 -  Hey, get up.

377
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,150
- We need Jae Seok back!
 -  He didn't even call my name.

378
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,390
He said, "Hey, get up".

379
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,120
- She's Jong Kook's partner.
 -  You're a partner of Jong Kook.

380
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,190
- Do you like him?
 -  Well...

381
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,820
She called Jong Kook late at night when she was drunk.

382
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,130
- But he didn't answer the call.
 -  Really?

383
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,590
What are you talking about, Haha? I didn't call him.

384
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,090
- I didn't call him.
 -  She didn't.

385
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,090
She wanted to get Jong Kook's phone number...

386
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,110
- Gosh, I didn't call him.
 -  No. She didn't.

387
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,220
- Okay, what should I do now?
 -  Right, well...

388
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,660
- Yes.
 -  Did you gain weight?

389
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,250
(What a novel question for an interview!)

390
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,720
- How can you ask her that?
 -  I just...

391
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,420
- What are you doing?
 -  Are you trying to mess with her?

392
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,890
- Are you out of your mind?
 -  Do you think I gained weight?

393
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,610
- Yes, a little bit.
 -  But you look good.

394
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,700
- You look fine.
 -  Okay. Please sit down, then.

395
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,530
- Have a seat.
 -  Was that it?

396
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,830
- Zico, Zico.
 -  Zico!

397
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,110
- Hello. Hello.
 -  Hey, Zico.

398
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,920
Two of the best three Co's are here.

399
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,490
My nickname is Wang Co, and you're Zico.

400
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,090
Do you think you'll get the centre today?

401
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,550
- To be honest,
 -  Yes.

402
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,090
I'm not really obsessed with being in the centre.

403
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,190
(One less competitor!)

404
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,820
But for Ji Hyo, I'll do my best...

405
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,520
- to move to the front.
 -  I'll count on you.

406
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,920
I saw Zico dancing before on TV. He's a great dancer.

407
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,650
- What is that out of the blue?
 -  Should he dance all of a sudden?

408
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,120
- That's so unexpected.
 -  Play the music.

409
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,330
You know I danced like this.

410
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,650
(Haha seems to know Zico's dance.)

411
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,050
- Can you chant like this for me?
 -  Okay.

412
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,500
- How?
 -  Like this.

413
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,220
(I say "Ho", then you say "Ho".)

414
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,350
That's it.

415
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,860
(That's exciting.)

416
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,920
(I'm the centre of Block B!)

417
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,600
(Haha follows Zico's lead.)

418
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,860
There it is. Do it like this.

419
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,620
Yes, that was it.

420
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,800
- Okay, he's Zico!
 -  Just do the way you always do.

421
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,920
Finally...

422
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,550
- What are you doing?
 -  Zico's interview is done.

423
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,320
- Why is Zico's turn over?
 -  It's over.

424
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,620
- It ended so suddenly.
 -  It ended in the middle of dancing.

425
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,870
It's over.

426
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,600
- Hyeon Gyeong, Nice to meet you.
 -  Hello.

427
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,490
- I'm a big fan of yours.
 -  Really?

428
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,020
I do like you a lot.

429
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,490
You're so cute on the show that you do with Jae Seok.

430
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,360
It's not the time for a confession.

431
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,800
- You're all flushed. What was that?
 -  Is he out of his mind?

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,690
You know Hyeon Gyeong...

433
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,850
became a good entertainer thanks to SBS.

434
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,350
- That's so right.
 -  Were you on "Xman"?

435
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,720
- Yes.
 -  On "Xman",

436
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,690
she was become famous for being too nervous.

437
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,890
- That's right.
 -  Really?

438
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,250
It's been 10 years, and she changed a lot.

439
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,650
Hey, we're in the middle of an interview.

440
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,920
- Sorry?
 -  I'm still interviewing her now.

441
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,490
- He's way better than you.
 -  So what happened next?

442
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,920
At that time, she wasn't a good dancer.

443
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,620
Right. She never danced before.

444
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,730
- But she's so good at it now.
 -  How do you feel to be here?

445
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,820
- I am very happy.
 -  I see.

446
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,600
Do you always answer this short?

447
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,460
- Do you?
 -  Please interview her sincerely.

448
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,650
Please ask her something she can come up with a long answer.

449
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,610
It's so chaotic here today.

450
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,820
Are you a fan of Kwang Soo? Do you like him?

451
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,650
She didn't say she's my fan. Why do you ask her such question?

452
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,990
- She collects toy giraffes.
 -  Really? Why?

453
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,690
- Why?
 -  She has many toy giraffes at home.

454
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,650
- Kwang Soo also collects it.
 -  Really?

455
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,820
- Do you have a lot of them?
 -  His nickname is giraffe.

456
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,320
- People think I like Kwang Soo.
 -  That's right.

457
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,590
So you don't like him. Do you want to...

458
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,690
- change your partner to me?
 -  No.

459
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,020
- What was that?
 -  I can't believe this.

460
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,320
- Your partner, Bo Ah, is there!
 -  Are you out of your mind?

461
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,730
- That was so wrong.
 -  Call the police!

462
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,620
So today, show us your charms one by one.

463
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,800
That's it for Hyeon Gyeong.

464
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,820
- That's it?
 -  Really?

465
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,620
- What's with that face?
 -  It's such an old style.

466
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,850
- Have a seat.
 -  Sure.

467
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,060
I want to yell this to the entire world.

468
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,260
This host sucks!

469
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,620
- Goodness.
 -  All right, next.

470
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,550
- Su Jin's shoulders look cold.
 -  I'm freezing.

471
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
- She's a broad-shouldered gangster.
 -  It's been a while.

472
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,860
Would this be enough?

473
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,490
This should be good for now.

474
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,540
Su Jin, this is for the other side.

475
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,920
This should be good.

476
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,120
She's a broad-shouldered gangster.

477
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,220
She is.

478
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,490
- She's really strong.
 -  She definitely is.

479
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,160
Last time you were on the show,

480
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,700
- you ripped out all our name tags.
 -  Yes.

481
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,730
Gary mentioned...

482
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,460
that he's a side-seeker.

483
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,140
- He is.
 -  So...

484
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,740
I think they partnered me up with him on purpose.

485
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,050
- We won when she was my partner.
 -  That's right.

486
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,590
Gary changes depending on how the women treat him.

487
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,750
Is that right?

488
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,920
- Oh, gosh.
 -  I'll do my best.

489
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,050
All right.

490
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,470
- Gary, you...
 -  Stop asking questions!

491
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,820
- She said she's cold!
 -  I'm cold!

492
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,790
Okay, we'll find out your charms with time.

493
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,220
(Let's explore your charms when it's warmer.)

494
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,520
(He's abrupt.)

495
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,920
- Have a seat.
 -  What's he doing?

496
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,380
My goodness.

497
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,860
I'll work harder from now on.

498
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,920
- This is great.
 -  I've learned again.

499
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,560
- Nice to meet you.
 -  Hello.

500
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,360
Your name is...

501
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,060
- Is it Stephanie?
 -  It's Stephanie Lee!

502
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,900
- It's Stephanie Lee!
 -  I'm sorry. I'm bad with names.

503
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,890
- It's Stephanie Lee.
 -  You're the one who introduced her.

504
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,220
It's Stephanie Lee.

505
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,670
You introduced her.

506
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,290
- You were in a commercial, right?
 -  Can you show us what you did?

507
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,400
Can you show us again?

508
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,430
(Her perfect English pronunciation made her well-known.)

509
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,990
From Neutrogena.

510
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,480
(From Neutrogena)

511
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,150
(She sounds like a foreigner.)

512
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,640
Who do you like the most on Running Man?

513
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,650
To be honest, I wanted to be Kwang Soo's partner,

514
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,390
but I got Haha.

515
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,550
- So I didn't wear heels today.
 -  Who's that?

516
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,620
She has no heels.

517
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,590
She should have worn heels to help me out.

518
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,990
Really? Like this?

519
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,330
(That would have been funnier.)

520
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,560
"Neutrogena".

521
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
(It's funny enough.)

522
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,430
Okay, Stephanie. We'll find out your charms with time.

523
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,820
- How's the time?
 -  My goodness.

524
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,890
We have a lot of time.

525
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,270
What do we do next?

526
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,550
The theme is Battle for the Centre: The One Who Holds the Throne.

527
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,190
Through each mission, the winner will take the centre...

528
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,100
and will enjoy extravagance and great treatment.

529
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,820
But those who are ousted from the centre...

530
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,500
will receive punishments accordingly.

531
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,290
Depending on your ranks in each mission, you will be awarded points.

532
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,600
According to the results, all but the person in the centre...

533
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,020
will stand in front of the blue screen in a blue outfit...

534
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,270
- and will disappear.
 -  Oh, my goodness.

535
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,120
We'll award your first points by where you are sitting.

536
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,100
(Seok Jin's Team earns the most, 4 points.)

537
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,760
(Battle for the Centre)

538
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,860
What do we do now?

539
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,080
- The first game for today...
 -  All right.

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,790
is called, "Only I Belong on TV".

541
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,750
Before we play the actual game, we'll do a warm-up.

542
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,120
- This is an old school game.
 -  We used to play this a lot.

543
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,590
- You blow out the candles.
 -  This is old school.

544
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,020
You have to flip the skirt.

545
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,750
The winner gets a whistle so you can decide when people go.

546
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,420
The warm-up will be played by...

547
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,900
the guests who are here today to move their partners to the centre.

548
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,250
- They'll play for us?
 -  The guests will go.

549
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,200
Seok Jin, can you lead the game?

550
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,000
- He doesn't know what to do.
 -  Let's get into the game right now.

551
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,420
- Slow down.
 -  We have to talk.

552
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,220
When do we get to hear the guests talking?

553
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,050
- We have a lot to cover.
 -  But Jin Young...

554
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,210
For all the times I've been on this show, I've never been this quiet.

555
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,210
- She's never like this.
 -  This is the first time I spoke.

556
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,550
We want to hear their voices.

557
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,250
Seok Jin, use me as your reporter.

558
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,350
He could be the assistant.

559
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,590
- I'll be your assistant reporter.
 -  That's right.

560
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,420
- This doesn't look good.
 -  No, I'll be your assistant.

561
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,920
Let's hear from Jae Seok on site.

562
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,500
- Just say that.
 -  Okay.

563
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,650
- Reporter Yu Jae Seok.
 -  Yes.

564
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,630
- Please lead this segment.
 -  All right.

565
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,350
- Jae Seok is on site.
 -  On behalf of Seok Jin,

566
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,430
This is what we've come to.

567
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,350
I'm your assistant.

568
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,450
You passed it down.

569
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,190
- That's what it is.
 -  Let's make it that.

570
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,020
Su Jin, you met Gary again...

571
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,820
- after one year.
 -  Exactly.

572
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,850
- We won.
 -  You won last time.

573
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,050
Earlier, she was putting on her heels and asked,

574
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,320
"We are ripping name tags today, right?"

575
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,300
(She's determined to rip name tags once again.)

576
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm being honest.

577
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,120
- She's no joke. She's very strong.
 -  Seriously.

578
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,820
- Your face became smaller.
 -  Gary...

579
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,550
- spoke a lot about her too.
 -  Really?

580
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,890
He mentioned her while he was getting dressed for today.

581
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,320
- He wanted to be on Su Jin's team.
 -  Yes.

582
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,850
(He wanted Su Jin to be on his team.)

583
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,120
He said he'd get her number no matter what.

584
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,220
(He is determined to get her number.)

585
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,230
Goodness.

586
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,620
Hey, stop it.

587
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,790
- Keep quiet. Let him be.
 -  I know, right?

588
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,800
Can I ask you one thing?

589
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,030
Su Jin, do you have a boyfriend right now?

590
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,150
(Is she seeing anybody?)

591
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,030
- No.
 -  That's good!

592
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,530
Gary isn't seeing anybody either.

593
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,220
- That's good.
 -  Gary's lucky.

594
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,720
- Gary.
 -  If I had one, I'll wrap it up.

595
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Our next team is a romantic couple that we've been looking forward to.

596
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,750
It's been so long after Yoon Eun Hye.

597
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,420
- Seriously.
 -  Yes, right?

598
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
Why are you doing this to me?

599
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,590
Jin Young's trademark is her cuteness.

600
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,190
- There are a few she usually does.
 -  That's right.

601
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,600
- Can you do it to Jong Kook?
 -  He'll fall for it.

602
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,490
- To me?
 -  He'll get uneasy.

603
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,550
That's right.

604
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,330
I'm feeling great.

605
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,860
Jong Kook, you.

606
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,990
How's this?

607
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,290
Thumbs up for you

608
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,820
(Thumbs up for you!)

609
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,100
(Snapping)

610
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,890
(Goosebumps)

611
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,820
It'll pop up in his head before he goes to bed.

612
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,820
- That's excellent.
 -  He'll remember it.

613
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,000
- That's excellent.
 -  Jin Young is so good.

614
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,390
I think everyone's having a great time except me.

615
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,130
(He's the only one not happy.)

616
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,200
- They're full of laughter.
 -  You're right.

617
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,630
- I'm having a good time.
 -  This is great.

618
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,150
(I have a bad vibe.)

619
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,290
- Seriously...
 -  Hold on a bit longer.

620
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,220
Hold on a little bit. It'll change after this game.

621
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,100
This must be a poisonous grail. Watch out.

622
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,530
It makes your face gloomy.

623
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,320
You don't look too well.

624
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,350
Guys, don't try to be the centre.

625
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,990
For me, to say this bluntly,

626
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,690
I'm still wondering about this.

627
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,450
- Aren't you surprised?
 -  I don't know why you are a team.

628
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,520
Why were you two put together?

629
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,050
Bo Ah, weren't you hoping to be on Jae Seok's team?

630
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,760
I didn't make any guesses on who my teammate was going to be.

631
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,650
- But the partner I wanted...
 -  Be quiet.

632
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,900
- was Jong Kook.
 -  Me?

633
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,930
Why are you happy?

634
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,220
(Are you smiling?)

635
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,400
Are you?

636
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,250
- I could be happy about it.
 -  Gosh, I can't do this.

637
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,560
- That's good to hear.
 -  You.

638
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,320
- That's good to hear.
 -  Fine.

639
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,100
- Turn your body towards me.
 -  All right.

640
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,330
- I'm your partner today.
 -  I know that.

641
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,300
This is great.

642
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,800
Then, let's start with an acrostic poem with Seok Jin's name.

643
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,960
- Should we?
 -  This is a must.

644
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,090
- You'll go next with Bo Ah's name.
 -  Okay.

645
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,660
- Let's go for it. "Jee".
 -  "Jee".

646
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,850
Jee Seok Jin.

647
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,200
Okay, "Jee Seok Jin". "Seok".

648
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,670
I'm disappointed.

649
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,530
"I'm disappointed." Okay, "Jin".

650
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,150
I really want to change my partner.

651
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,600
(I really want to change my partner.)

652
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,830
She's being serious.

653
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,450
This is real.

654
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,620
- She's telling the truth.
 -  It's the truth.

655
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,620
- It's the truth.
 -  It is for sure.

656
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,820
- This is for real.
 -  She really doesn't want it.

657
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,920
- Let's go with Bo Ah's name.
 -  Why would I do this?

658
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,620
- Let's go with her name.
 -  I'm not in the best mood.

659
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,230
- Okay, "Cho".
 -  Get rid of it.

660
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,500
- I had some expectations...
 -  My goodness.

661
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,150
to be the centre.

662
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,730
- "I had some expectations..."
 -  Okay, "Bo".

663
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,430
Like you see it here, I'm a mess.

664
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,130
- That sounds good.
 -  "Ah".

665
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh, I hate to be in the centre.

666
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,290
(His poem touches everybody's hearts.)

667
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,920
As for Hyeon Gyeong,

668
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,990
- she was on "X Man" in 2004.
 -  She was so cute.

669
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,650
She never spoke much, so I nicknamed her Nervous Girl.

670
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,690
- But she's changed completely.
 -  Even when she danced,

671
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,520
she was so nervous but that made her popular.

672
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,650
But she learned to dance from her friend...

673
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,190
and now she's a dancing machine.

674
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,680
- Am I right?
 -  Yes, I'm good at dancing.

675
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,940
Can you do a body wave?

676
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,350
- She's so confident.
 -  I'm not even joking.

677
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,090
If you have music ready, she can show you.

678
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,260
- Show us.
 -  I want to see it.

679
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,000
This is the "X Man" version.

680
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,900
What do I do?

681
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,030
(What's this?)

682
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,490
- I'll go again.
 -  Hey!

683
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,560
(Hey!)

684
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,230
Stop lying.

685
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,720
- What were you saying?
 -  Hold on.

686
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,150
- She didn't prepare anything.
 -  She's so cute.

687
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,920
- I thought she was actually good.
 -  She's good.

688
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,390
I can't watch her.

689
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,560
- There you go.
 -  What is this about?

690
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,700
She can do hip-hop dances too. She really is.

691
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,350
Is she being serious?

692
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,490
She is.

693
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,320
Isn't she trying to be funny?

694
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,120
No, she's doing this for real. She's serious.

695
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,790
- You are bold.
 -  She learned all this.

696
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,350
She doesn't dance to the music. It's just whatever she learned.

697
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,190
Do you want to see her do it? She'll dance the same to hip-hop.

698
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,850
(They play a hip-hop music.)

699
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,060
See? The same applies here.

700
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,690
(She's rigid.)

701
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,290
- See?
 -  She always starts like this?

702
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,950
It's the same for every type of music.

703
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,630
She's not affected at all.

704
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,350
(She's rusted.)

705
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,810
Hyeon Gyeong, do the body wave.

706
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,300
- Make her stop.
 -  There you go.

707
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,930
Look at her. That's great.

708
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,620
That's excellent.

709
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,810
- You have your own style.
 -  Right?

710
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,050
She always does the body wave.

711
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,890
She's the boldest dancer.

712
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,650
- She's one of the best in Korea.
 -  She's so bold.

713
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,150
We didn't really see Zico dance.

714
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,890
- That wasn't enough earlier.
 -  Okey Dokey

715
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,690
- My dance?
 -  His movements are different.

716
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,420
You'll be shocked when you see him move.

717
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,550
- Zico!
 -  Victory...

718
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,920
(It's Zico's turn.)

719
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,030
Something like this?

720
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,150
Go with the groove.

721
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,960
(Grooving)

722
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,650
There you go.

723
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,530
(He's in rhythm with the beat.)

724
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,460
How do you do it?

725
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,230
(Cheering)

726
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,250
This is spontaneous.

727
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,150
Watch this.

728
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,570
(Zico's dance is full of hip-hop.)

729
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,760
This is it.

730
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,050
(Let's copy Zico.)

731
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,500
You're good.

732
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,230
- Wow.
 -  Do you have to make that face?

733
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,150
(They're good but they don't look good together.)

734
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,490
Wow, look at Stephanie.

735
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,290
(They're good but they don't look good together.)

736
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,060
You're too tall.

737
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,650
She's too tall. She's this big.

738
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,820
- Hey. Wait a minute.
 -  He has to look up.

739
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,290
She's so tall that he has to look up.

740
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,190
You look very pathetic.

741
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,390
Your neck almost got paralysed.

742
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,530
It felt like I was a child dancing with my mummy.

743
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
It looked like a grade school talent show.

744
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,850
(It was like "Oh My Baby" in Running Man.)

745
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,350
He has to punch like this.

746
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,450
- All right. That's so funny.
 -  The dance was sexy.

747
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,720
I am Reporter Yu Jae Seok.

748
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,400
- Thank you!
 -  All right.

749
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,040
- I am a little bit pressured.
 -  Okay.

750
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,330
- Now, the whistle...
 -  Yes.

751
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,520
(He ruined the mood.)

752
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
- Whistle...
 -  What about the whistle?

753
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,730
- You can win it on this game.
 -  Okay.

754
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,690
- Your partner will wear a skirt.
 -  Yes.

755
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,230
The team that blows out the most number of candles wins the whistle.

756
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,250
Obviously.

757
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,990
We have to first change into those outfits.

758
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,120
- Yes.
 -  Come on!

759
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,030
- Me?
 -  Let's do this.

760
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,090
We will start with the fourth row.

761
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,950
Gary, you are on the fourth row, right?

762
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,620
- Yes.
 -  Haha and Gary are.

763
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,720
- Su Jin will start first.
 -  Me?

764
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,850
- You only get one chance.
 -  Let's go!

765
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,850
- Su Jin has quick movements...
 -  That's right.

766
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,890
- and is very competitive.
 -  She is very competitive.

767
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,650
You are pressuring me. Stop it.

768
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,290
- Relax. Don't get pressured.
 -  Okay.

769
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,800
- Okay.
 -  It's her first time to do it.

770
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,330
- Here we go.
 -  Let's go!

771
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,000
Go, Su Jin! Fly!

772
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,360
(I'm counting on you!)

773
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,590
(She always had a fighting spirit.)

774
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,120
- I got it.
 -  Go!

775
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,820
- Su Jin. Su Jin.
 -  Go!

776
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,320
Kwang Soo is there. Su Jin, don't do this to me.

777
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,960
Su Jin! Please!

778
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,350
(The female warrior, Kyung Su Jin, is back!)

779
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,400
- Let's go!
 -  Okay.

780
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,150
Go, Su Jin! Fly!

781
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,160
(Running)

782
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,250
(She generates a powerful wind.)

783
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,590
(She gave her everything.)

784
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,850
- She fell.
 -  She did her best.

785
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,150
- Bravo.
 -  She's good.

786
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,590
You're good.

787
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,050
- She's really good.
 -  You are really good.

788
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,320
- She blew out a lot.
 -  That's considered a lot.

789
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,580
- That was really great.
 -  This is it.

790
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,000
- This is it.
 -  Good job!

791
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,750
- Good job.
 -  Impressive. She's good.

792
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,220
- She's really good.
 -  She's good.

793
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,620
- That's really good.
 -  Good job.

794
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,630
She did really well.

795
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,520
Next is Stephanie. She is tall.

796
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,420
- Yes.
 -  She has an advantage.

797
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,920
- She has an advantage.
 -  Right.

798
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,450
- How many can you blow out?
 -  Maybe you grabbed it too high.

799
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,070
I will blow out all of them.

800
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,250
(She has a big ambition.)

801
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,660
- She's ambitious.
 -  She will blow them all out.

802
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,390
All right. Let's go!

803
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,270
Make it as wide as you can.

804
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,560
Here she comes.

805
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,820
(She bows powerfully.)

806
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,300
(It's a wind blast!)

807
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,750
Here she comes.

808
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,350
(She ran lightly and flapped the skirt from high above.)

809
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,560
- Some revived.
 -  It was so close.

810
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,260
Some revived.

811
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,520
- Some revived.
 -  It was so close.

812
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,550
- Some revived.
 -  The last part is important.

813
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,780
- She blew out 33 candles!
 -  Yes!

814
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,920
You did well.

815
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Su Jin blew out 31 candles, and Stephanie blew out 33 candles.

816
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,150
Next is Hyeon Gyeong. All right, let's go.

817
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,850
She says she's not competitive, and she's a bad athlete too.

818
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,020
- You should make...
 -  But she might do well today.

819
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,750
But she used to be known for being nervous all the time,

820
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,890
and she's being reborn as an entertainer.

821
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,520
- I am really bad at sports.
 -  Get ready. Go!

822
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,620
(Please do well!)

823
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,000
- Let's go.
 -  Go Hyeon Gyeong!

824
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,820
(She screams shortly.)

825
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,160
(Jumping)

826
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,950
(She collapses right away.)

827
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,880
She tripped, didn't she?

828
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,190
- She tripped, right?
 -  Are you okay?

829
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,220
- She's good.
 -  She's a good entertainer.

830
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,450
- Let's go!
 -  She started like an athlete.

831
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,150
(She started like an athlete and landed like an entertainer.)

832
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,130
She tripped, didn't she? She tripped, right?

833
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,430
She tripped, didn't she?

834
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,050
- She tripped, right?
 -  Are you okay?

835
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,720
- She's good.
 -  You're good.

836
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,050
She's a good entertainer, isn't she?

837
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,050
- She's an entertainer.
 -  She's a treasure.

838
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,250
- She tripped.
 -  What's her score? 10 candles.

839
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,100
- 10 candles?
 -  That's bad.

840
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,150
- All right.
 -  Shouldn't Jong Kook...

841
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,390
cheer her up by raising his thumb?

842
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,540
No, it's okay.

843
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,850
- Please do it for me.
 -  It's a good idea.

844
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,990
- Do it for her.
 -  It's a good idea.

845
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,400
So how do I do it?

846
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,700
- Thumbs...
 -  Thumbs up for you

847
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
- You have to bounce at the end.
 -  Jong Kook,

848
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,520
you have to make sure to bounce your bottoms.

849
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,560
- Hurry up.
 -  Hurry up and do it.

850
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,750
Thumbs up for you

851
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,320
(Thumbs up for you!)

852
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,090
(Her cuteness makes Jong Kook dance.)

853
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,140
- You're really liking it.
 -  Jin Young.

854
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,250
- He never does that.
 -  Here we go.

855
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,250
- Go! – Fly. Fly.

856
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,830
(Jin Young departs!)

857
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,120
Thumbs up for you

858
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,360
(Come on, Jin Young!)

859
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,520
(Did Jong Kook's cheer help?)

860
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,600
- Go! – Fly. Fly.

861
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,300
What?

862
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,020
(What was that?)

863
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,260
- What is she doing?
 -  What is she doing?

864
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,260
(She falls on her back.)

865
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,390
(She just lied down on her back.)

866
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,660
Is she drunk? Is she?

867
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,450
- Go!
 -  Fly. Fly.

868
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,750
(There are many parties during spring, but drink moderately.)

869
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,670
- What is she doing?
 -  Is she drunk? Is she?

870
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,120
(I regret raising my thumbs up.)

871
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,700
- What did you just do?
 -  This is too bad.

872
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,450
- You are out.
 -  You lose!

873
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,520
- She's terrible at playing sports.
 -  You are out.

874
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,190
- You should act instead.
 -  I can't play sports.

875
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,300
You would've blown out some candles if you just fell.

876
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,730
Next is In Young!

877
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,320
- That's it.
 -  What is he doing?

878
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,950
- What are you doing?
 -  Wait.

879
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,490
I wanted her to relax. Do the shadow boxing.

880
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,840
Come on, In Young. That's right.

881
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,720
(She's doing it.)

882
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,370
She avoided the punches.

883
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,340
- She went like this.
 -  No way.

884
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,730
She avoided the punch.

885
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,430
Good job, In Young. 1, 2. 1, 2.

886
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,290
- I can't believe it.
 -  Good job.

887
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,580
- Let's do this, In Young.
 -  Let's go, In Young.

888
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,090
- Don't hesitate, In Young.
 -  Go!

889
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,370
Open it widely. That's it.

890
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,430
Go. Go.

891
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,990
(She drops from high above.)

892
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,330
(It was a powerful one.)

893
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,150
Open it widely. That's it.

894
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,720
(She dominated the air and fell aggressively.)

895
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,260
All right.

896
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,390
Okay!

897
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:29,900
(What is In Young's record?)

898
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,250
- But she did really well.
 -  Only about five...

899
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,650
- It was good though.
 -  If you hold it...

900
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,790
- Let me count. 1, 2, 3, 4...
 -  too widely, it's not powerful.

901
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,080
- Good job, In Young.
 -  You should hit strongly.

902
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,050
- In Young blew out 19 candles.
 -  But she was good.

903
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,890
Right now, Stephanie is leading the game.

904
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,250
- Zico!
 -  He has a strong chance to win.

905
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,160
He's the only male participant.

906
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,370
- Actually, Zico is...
 -  I think he will do well.

907
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,490
Zico, how many candles do you think you can blow out?

908
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,150
About 35 to 40.

909
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,750
Really? Actually that's just enough.

910
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,240
- That's not too many.
 -  He has to do it.

911
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,460
- Here we go. Go!
 -  Go, Zico!

912
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Zico!

913
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,550
(Hip-hop trained him to be brutal. Zico's power is revealed now.)

914
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,750
- Let's go!
 -  Go!

915
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,990
Zico!

916
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,020
(He flops down.)

917
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,370
- Zico.
 -  Hold on...

918
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,100
Zico!

919
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,120
(He just fell on his nose!)

920
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,460
- Zico.
 -  Hey.

921
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,150
- Zico...
 -  He fell on his nose!

922
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,100
- Is your nose all right?
 -  He fell on his nose.

923
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,750
Are you okay, Zico?

924
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:34,960
(He gathered all the energy within the skirt and ended in misery.)

925
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,940
- Is your nose okay?
 -  He fell on his nose.

926
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,390
- Are you okay, Zico?
 -  Are you all right?

927
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,960
- Bo Ah is up next.
 -  Are you okay?

928
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,090
Now it's most likely that Stephanie is going to win.

929
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,450
We don't know how Bo Ah will do.

930
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,750
(Stephanie who blew out 33 candles is most likely to win as of now.)

931
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,800
- She's going to do well.
 -  She's good.

932
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,220
So 33 is the record.

933
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,990
- Bo Ah is going to try it.
 -  Go, Bo Ah!

934
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,550
She's the competitive type.

935
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,030
- Go!
 -  Go.

936
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,690
Wait. But Bo Ah.

937
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,870
(Flapping)

938
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,060
(The wind was strong.)

939
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,250
(The majority of the candles are blown out.)

940
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,760
- Yes. I knew she'd do well.
 -  She's good.

941
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,060
Seok Jin can't be the winner again!

942
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,190
- No way.
 -  Really?

943
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,450
No way.

944
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,350
(What is Bo Ah's record?)

945
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,260
- 34?
 -  34.

946
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,450
(Bo Ah blew out 34 candles!)

947
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh dear.

948
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,390
(She beats Stephanie by 1 candle.)

949
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,450
- 34?
 -  By 1 candle?

950
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,520
It's okay. It was fun.

951
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
- I should've just sat and flapped.
 -  But it doesn't feel too nice.

952
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,990
- This can't happen.
 -  Seok Jin gets to keep the centre.

953
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,220
(Seok Jin maintains the centre position.)

954
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,620
This is the real game to determine the first centre.

955
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,450
You will dance to an exciting song,

956
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,890
- and when the winners of...
 -  They will blow the whistle.

957
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,190
the pre-game blow the whistle, you will run to the TV frame.

958
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,020
The camera is on a timer.

959
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,190
You'll succeed if you are included in the picture.

960
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,550
According to the game result, you'll be given points.

961
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,720
And that will determine what you eat for lunch.

962
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,020
(The game result determines their lunch menu!)

963
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,310
- I want to eat something good.
 -  I'm hungry.

964
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,720
You always eat something delicious.

965
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,960
- But I want to have it today.
 -  Then we need to win.

966
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,900
(The centre table is like a feast.)

967
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,090
So we begin when Seok Jin blows the whistle, right?

968
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,520
You know the rules, right?

969
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,360
- Yes.
 -  Dance to the music.

970
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,450
And when I blow the whistle, jump in front of the frame.

971
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,190
- If both are in the picture...
 -  You pass?

972
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,490
Tall ones have the advantage.

973
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,340
- That's true.
 -  Music, cue!

974
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,030
(Music starts.)

975
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,200
(Waving)

976
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,890
(There's strange tension!)

977
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,030
(They show perfect harmony.)

978
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,260
(They have to stay alert even while dancing.)

979
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,320
- Don't stay here.
 -  Move.

980
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,400
- Move.
 -  It's dangerous.

981
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,030
(Seok Jin teases them.)

982
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,120
(Everyone is looking at Seok Jin.)

983
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,690
Come on, Su Jin.

984
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,020
I can't do it.

985
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,800
(He blew it!)

986
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,640
(They all jump.)

987
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,850
(The centre is mine!)

988
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,750
- Move!
 -  Jump!

989
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,460
In 1, 2, 3.

990
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,590
In 1, 2, 3.

991
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,860
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

992
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,660
(Everyone is trying so hard to be at the centre.)

993
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,520
- All right.
 -  Let's check it.

994
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,620
- I think we did okay.
 -  We might be there.

995
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,450
Don't all go to the front.

996
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,190
You'll definitely be on the picture.

997
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,920
- You held onto me.
 -  I had to.

998
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,930
I need to be the centre again.

999
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,920
- You have to do it to know.
 -  It's not something...

1000
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,500
We are at a disadvantage.

1001
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,870
(The picture is revealed.)

1002
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,600
- We are there!
 -  Look.

1003
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,860
Haha did it.

1004
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,750
- We are not there at all.
 -  We can never do it.

1005
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,390
It's really tough.

1006
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,150
- You're not there.
 -  Look at Stephanie.

1007
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,220
(Kwang Soo couple and Haha couple succeeded.)

1008
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,400
Stephanie are you into reggae?

1009
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,460
- She's like Bob Marley.
 -  Stephanie looks like Bob Marley.

1010
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,960
- What is that?
 -  You got blocked by him.

1011
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,860
- Look at Hyeon Gyeong's hair.
 -  She's Bob Marley.

1012
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,410
- Look at Bo Ah's hair.
 -  Look at Hyeon Gyeong.

1013
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,890
- We're in the picture!
 -  There you are.

1014
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,620
Haha's couple and Kwang Soo's couple passed.

1015
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,220
(The two candidate couples are decided.)

1016
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,530
Well done.

1017
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,090
- Yes.
 -  We don't have to do it the same.

1018
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,900
It would be better to find a good spot.

1019
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,950
- Let's go find the good spot.
 -  In Young, let's move forward.

1020
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,490
- Do you just keep jumping?
 -  In Young is tall.

1021
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,000
- In Young will get it.
 -  Su Jin is tying her shoes again.

1022
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,090
- She's determined.
 -  She's ready to beat us all.

1023
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:41,390
We will do it until we have the two losing teams.

1024
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,860
We will do it until three teams pass.

1025
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,160
Give us the music!

1026
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,190
(I want to be on television)

1027
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,590
(Then it would be very nice)

1028
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,090
Zico sure is different.

1029
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,720
- I want to be on television
 -  I want to be on television

1030
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,950
- Let's dance together.
 -  Don't cheat.

1031
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,200
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Why would you do this?

1032
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,160
(Shall we get it started?)

1033
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,530
Wait.

1034
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,220
(He blows the whistle.)

1035
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,390
Start jumping.

1036
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,830
(They all gather in the centre.)

1037
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,190
In 1, 2, 3.

1038
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,250
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1039
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,820
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Jump.

1040
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,250
(Get out of my way.)

1041
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,960
(They commit fouls to get in the picture!)

1042
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,500
(Team Jong Kook jumps when the others are coming down.)

1043
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,930
(The game is over.)

1044
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,960
Who kept grabbing my shoulders?

1045
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,790
- In Young is great.
 -  Maybe we got it.

1046
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,720
In Young, you have to be in the picture.

1047
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,930
- Good job, In Young.
 -  What did you do?

1048
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,360
- I'm in it!
 -  I'm in it too!

1049
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,920
- We are in it, In Young.
 -  Are we in it?

1050
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,400
We are in it!

1051
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,190
(Team Jae Seok, Team Gary and Team Ji Hyo succeed.)

1052
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,750
We passed!

1053
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,520
- His hat's off.
 -  You passed.

1054
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
- We are there.
 -  He's wearing a hat.

1055
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,130
- Look at Gary.
 -  Please put a hat on my head.

1056
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,950
(Even Gary must've been pressured.)

1057
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,700
- Who is he?
 -  Gary looks so funny.

1058
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,490
- Gary looks so funny.
 -  Gary hasn't changed at all.

1059
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,620
- The picture looks nice.
 -  I am sorry.

1060
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,820
- In Young, good job.
 -  I am sorry, Bo Ah.

1061
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,580
(It seems like Gary's time travels backwards.)

1062
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,720
- Gary looks so funny.
 -  What's up with his hair?

1063
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,990
- I look ridiculous.
 -  All right.

1064
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,320
So now, Team Jong Kook and Team Seok Jin will take the fourth row.

1065
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,330
Does that mean we can't eat something good?

1066
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,800
Let's just eat what we get.

1067
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,590
(The middle rank play-off begins!)

1068
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,750
- Good job. Come on.
 -  Let's go!

1069
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,620
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1070
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,260
(They are nervous.)

1071
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,860
In 1, 2, 3.

1072
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,200
(The centre is mine!)

1073
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,500
- I wonder what happened.
 -  I just jumped.

1074
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,150
In Young and I passed!

1075
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,920
- That's it!
 -  Team Gary is in the third row.

1076
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,000
All right.

1077
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,450
(The three teams are the centre candidates.)

1078
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,860
(Team Gary and Team Ji Hyo are in the third row.)

1079
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,730
(Team Jong Kook and Team Seok Jin are in the fourth row.)

1080
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,220
- It became smaller.
 -  The TV is smaller now.

1081
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,500
Only the dirtiest players are here.

1082
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,860
- This is really tricky.
 -  All the dirty players are here.

1083
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,250
- Gosh.
 -  This is going to be tough.

1084
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,320
- Now the centre will be decided.
 -  Yes!

1085
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,960
- Are you ready?
 -  You look very happy.

1086
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,290
And let me remind you...

1087
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,120
that your meal quality depends on your rank.

1088
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,900
- Okay.
 -  I haven't heard that word in ages.

1089
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,250
- You know that, right?
 -  Yes. We know.

1090
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,060
Music, please.

1091
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,360
Did you practise it?

1092
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,230
(They do a couple dance and livens up the vibe!)

1093
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,890
(What do we do?)

1094
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,690
(You can count on me!)

1095
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,920
(They start the sparring dance.)

1096
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,030
Keep going!

1097
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,400
(Trying hard)

1098
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,950
(I will do my best so that you can become the centre!)

1099
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,370
Change the role.

1100
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,450
Okay.

1101
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,980
(Next is Haha and Stephanie!)

1102
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,290
(Punching)

1103
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,960
(Gosh!)

1104
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,420
(It's the upgraded version of Team Jae Seok's dance.)

1105
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,550
(Let's do it energetically!)

1106
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,560
Let's go.

1107
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,990
(The time is now!)

1108
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,090
- This way.
 -  How do we do it?

1109
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,390
Okay. You have to get in the picture.

1110
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,250
- Stephanie, come to the front.
 -  It's not easy.

1111
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,590
- You have to jump!
 -  Come here, In Young.

1112
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,290
- Push him.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1113
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,250
(Kwang Soo is using his height to push Jae Seok down.)

1114
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,990
(They play all kinds of tricks!)

1115
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,700
(I am going to be in the picture!)

1116
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,620
(Game over)

1117
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,230
- It's over.
 -  Gosh! I couldn't jump!

1118
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,500
- Gosh.
 -  We did it this time.

1119
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,490
You just have to stand.

1120
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,130
- We did it this time.
 -  Did we do it this time?

1121
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,830
Did we make it this time?

1122
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,520
(Who will be getting...)

1123
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,130
(the centre table?)

1124
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,560
- Who is it?
 -  It's Kwang Soo.

1125
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,220
- Who is it?
 -  It's Team Kwang Soo.

1126
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,530
- Yes!
 -  Gosh.

1127
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,260
- It's the worst.
 -  Jae Seok blocked me.

1128
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,920
Yes!

1129
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,490
(Kwang Soo becomes the new centre!)

1130
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,660
- It's the worst.
 -  Jae Seok blocked me.

1131
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,100
(They are disappointed.)

1132
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,920
You could've made it hadn't I blocked your face.

1133
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,700
Kwang Soo got it.

1134
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,220
You could've made it hadn't I blocked your face.

1135
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,850
Kwang Soo became the centre.

1136
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,050
I am excited!

1137
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,550
Kwang Soo became the centre.

1138
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,060
- Congratulations.
 -  Well done.

1139
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,320
(The first row goes to Team Kwang Soo.)

1140
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,150
(The second row goes to Team Haha and Team Jae Seok.)

1141
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,520
Bo Ah, wait for me.

1142
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,090
(What kind of a meal will they get?)

1143
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,060
- Bye.
 -  What is that?

1144
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,390
(Elegant Korean table d'hote is laid out for the first position.)

1145
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,220
(Home style dishes are prepared for the second row.)

1146
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,950
(As you go further down, the quality of food goes down!)

1147
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,430
(The fourth row only gets rice balls and water?)

1148
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,720
- This is us.
 -  What is this?

1149
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,040
- What's this?
 -  This is too much.

1150
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,710
- Don't we deserve more than that?
 -  The second row is nice.

1151
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,950
- It's quite nice.
 -  Su Jin.

1152
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,590
I saw this a while ago.

1153
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,890
- We deserve more than this.
 -  I really love this.

1154
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,950
- I love it.
 -  The second row deserves more.

1155
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,820
- What do we get?
 -  The centre ones are lucky.

1156
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,430
- Come on.
 -  Are you guys hungry?

1157
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,550
- I really love this.
 -  Really?

1158
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,190
By the way, what are you doing?

1159
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,920
I was asking if you are hungry.

1160
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,320
- Right. You're the host now.
 -  You can't sit down just yet.

1161
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,250
- Jong Kook, don't sit.
 -  There's too much difference.

1162
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,350
- Why?
 -  You can't sit down yet.

1163
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,990
Don't we deserve some pickled vegetables at least?

1164
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,990
- It's a rice ball.
 -  Fourth row!

1165
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,250
- There's just too little food.
 -  It's okay.

1166
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,990
- Zico. What did they get?
 -  You got more than me.

1167
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,990
- Gary and Su Jin got the same.
 -  We need some condiments.

1168
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,690
- Haha.
 -  Can we get soy sauce?

1169
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,550
It's just steamed white rice.

1170
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,120
- We deserve some ham.
 -  Gosh...

1171
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,950
- Give us some dried laver then.
 -  Give us some more food.

1172
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,120
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
 -  The rice is too hard.

1173
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,290
- Wait. I'll go get some food.
 -  It's seasoned?

1174
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,390
It's really seasoned?

1175
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,190
- It's cold.
 -  You can start eating.

1176
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,620
- The rice is cold.
 -  We only have rice.

1177
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,390
- Give us something.
 -  I'm sure there's something inside.

1178
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,650
- It should be at least seasoned.
 -  We have nothing.

1179
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,490
Are you gangsters?

1180
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,990
- You can't just take our food.
 -  Anchovies and...

1181
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,050
How can you take everything?

1182
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,720
- How can you do this?
 -  Why did we play the game then?

1183
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,150
- We need some condiments.
 -  What do you want, In Young?

1184
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,820
(We could do this!)

1185
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,890
(Team Seok Jin goes too.)

1186
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,520
What's happening here?

1187
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,320
- Wait. Chef!
 -  We won't take the good ones.

1188
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,500
Wait. The chef is coming. What on earth is happening?

1189
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,390
- Please let me get some meat.
 -  Let me get some pancakes.

1190
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,980
If you take everything, what will we eat?

1191
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,600
- It's like a buffet.
 -  Then what's the point?

1192
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,050
I will flip the table so that no one can eat it!

1193
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,690
- It's like a buffet.
 -  Why is this a buffet?

1194
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,120
- It is a buffet.
 -  Hyeon Gyeong! Where is she?

1195
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,650
- Hyeon Gyeong!
 -  Why did you take that?

1196
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,260
Why did you bring the egg rice?

1197
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,100
We have more delicious things there!

1198
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,190
- I'll take some japchae too.
 -  No!

1199
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,320
(They looks like a group of starved hyenas.)

1200
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,420
- How can you eat all of this?
 -  What's going on?

1201
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,790
- Why would you take that?
 -  What are you doing, Hyeon Gyeong?

1202
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,690
- You should follow the rule.
 -  I have conscience.

1203
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,260
- So I don't take the good ones.
 -  Chef! Chef!

1204
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,190
Get lost, all of you!

1205
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,510
(Get lost, all of you!)

1206
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,250
- Gosh! Go away!
 -  Get some meat.

1207
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,660
- Get that one.
 -  Stop it!

1208
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,690
I told you to stop!

1209
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,400
(I told you to stop!)

1210
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,180
- You are so mean.
 -  Stop it!

1211
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,500
- Go away!
 -  This is the end.

1212
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,990
- Why are you trying to eat this?
 -  My egg!

1213
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,320
(He keeps shouting, but he can't stop them.)

1214
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,150
- Don't take our food!
 -  The egg is ours.

1215
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,200
- Hyeon Gyeong! Why are you there?
 -  It's really delicious.

1216
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,020
Why are you sitting there when we have a table?

1217
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,050
- It's really delicious.
 -  Wait.

1218
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,950
- It's margarine rice.
 -  Ji Hyo took a lot of food.

1219
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,150
- It's margarine rice.
 -  Look at it.

1220
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,220
- That doesn't look appetising.
 -  What happened here?

1221
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,900
That looks really delicious.

1222
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,720
- It's really good.
 -  Hey!

1223
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,960
It's been a long time since I ate like this.

1224
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,430
Gosh...

1225
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,360
I only took a little bit.

1226
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,290
- I didn't get any of that.
 -  Do you want some of this?

1227
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,720
- We have the meat, it's okay.
 -  Let's eat meat.

1228
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,220
- Let's eat meat.
 -  The seaweed is really good.

1229
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,850
It looks delicious. Is that Korean beef?

1230
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,900
- Is he grilling meat now?
 -  Yes. He's grilling the meat.

1231
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,260
- Everyone, the meat is grilled.
 -  Hey, come on.

1232
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,150
- I'll just take a little.
 -  You can't take this.

1233
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,890
You can't take the meat.

1234
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,320
You can eat other things, but you can't take the meat.

1235
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
- Hey, come on Zico.
 -  Please cut it for us.

1236
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,150
- I will cut it.
 -  Wait. You can't take the meat.

1237
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,710
- You are the host!
 -  We worked so hard for this.

1238
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,700
Please take your seats.

1239
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
What are you doing? Are you stray cats?

1240
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,660
What are you doing?

1241
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,300
- Could you cut the meat for us?
 -  I haven't even had rice yet.

1242
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,730
- Wait.

1243
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,500
I will...

1244
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,850
- Isn't that hot?
 -  Now, we need scissors.

1245
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,790
All we need are scissors.

1246
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,150
- Where's meat?
 -  Give it to me.

1247
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,720
Where is that big chunk of meat?

1248
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,890
Hey!

1249
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:31,990
What is it?

1250
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,450
Jin Young took it.

1251
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,700
Why did you take it?

1252
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,650
It's hot.

1253
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,590
- Here's some meat.
 -  Really?

1254
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,820
Thank you.

1255
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,250
(Su Jin and Gary also get meat.)

1256
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,330
- My goodness.
 -  I'll cut it for you.

1257
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,300
Thanks to Jin Young, I get a lot to eat.

1258
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,630
- This is so great.
 -  Isn't it?

1259
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,820
All I have on my rice is the meat's blood!

1260
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,890
(There's just blood on his rice.)

1261
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,320
Where is all the meat?

1262
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,730
(He lost them all.)

1263
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,900
I think...

1264
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,630
Jin Young eats the most.

1265
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,800
- She eats really a lot.
 -  Gosh, don't use your hand!

1266
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,800
Isn't it hot? Hey!

1267
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,660
Is she an animal?

1268
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,130
Hey!

1269
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,260
Jin Young is amazing.

1270
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,560
- She's good.
 -  Gosh.

1271
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,730
(Disappointed)

1272
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,150
- This is unbelievable.
 -  Where's your rice?

1273
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,810
What? Where's my rice?

1274
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,130
Gosh, give me my rice.

1275
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,030
I need rice at least!

1276
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,440
I'll check your tables!

1277
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,630
Where is it?

1278
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,760
Hyeon Gyeong, how could you not protect my rice?

1279
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,630
What?

1280
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,890
Do you care only about yourself?

1281
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,020
(She's selfish.)

1282
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,130
Hey! Where has my rice gone?

1283
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,140
I was grilling the meat for you!

1284
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,690
(Intimidated)

1285
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,640
- Where is my rice?
 -  That's funny.

1286
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,650
There's one more privilege for the centre.

1287
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,460
Okay. I definitely need it.

1288
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,720
- What is that?
 -  From this moment,

1289
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,500
we'll pull out the cameras for the second, third and fourth rows.

1290
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,660
Okay!

1291
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,620
- No way.
 -  Thank you!

1292
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,920
(Will they pull out our cameras?)

1293
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,300
Gosh, we need at least one for the second row.

1294
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,160
- Leave some cameras...
 -  That's nonsense.

1295
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,950
(All the cameras except the centre one are withdrawn.)

1296
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,310
Except the centre camera...

1297
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,600
- Really?
 -  What are you doing?

1298
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,130
Wait. You're here for Running Man. Come here and let them shoot you.

1299
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,650
Eat here.

1300
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,800
Just shoot me. Zoom in on me.

1301
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
- Good, Bo Ah.
 -  We'll shoot only the centre.

1302
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,920
No way.

1303
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,590
Gosh, why are you all here?

1304
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,030
- What is this?
 -  What's going on?

1305
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,360
Just shoot me only!

1306
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,330
- Good.
 -  Hey!

1307
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,250
Get out!

1308
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,020
Get out. Hey!

1309
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,190
Why are you all here?

1310
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,020
All right. Did you enjoy your meals?

1311
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,190
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

1312
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:44,700
- Then, it's time to move on.
 -  What's next?

1313
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,730
I'll count from 1 to 3. Please shout "Kwang Soo's Running Man" together.

1314
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,390
"Kwang Soo's..."

1315
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,700
- Stupid!
 -  Gosh.

1316
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,800
(What will be the next mission?)

1317
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,420
Please line up there.

1318
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,520
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

1319
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,820
- There.
 -  Where?

1320
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,390
There.

1321
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,460
What is this?

1322
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,180
- Please line up here.
 -  What are we going to do here?

1323
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,150
There are three colours of buoys in the pool.

1324
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,950
- Everyone...
 -  So we sit on there.

1325
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,260
I think that's the centre one.

1326
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
(This centre mission doesn't seem easy.)

1327
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,050
(Kwang Soo is the main host for now.)

1328
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,740
This mission is "Conquer the Main Camera".

1329
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,920
Goodness.

1330
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,220
(You're a bad host.)

1331
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,950
What's wrong with you?

1332
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,840
- You're so bad.
 -  Okay.

1333
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,760
This mission is "Main Camera"...

1334
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,290
What did you say?

1335
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,330
Come on!

1336
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,830
(He needs to be more awake!)

1337
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,850
He has been conquered already.

1338
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,290
Start it!

1339
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,450
It's "Conquer"...

1340
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,390
- "The Main Camera"!
 -  "The Main Camera"!

1341
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,260
("Conquer the Main Camera")

1342
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,800
- The monitor has seven sections.
 -  Okay.

1343
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,000
- That's the main one.
 -  Then,

1344
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,850
one camera will shoot...

1345
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,220
- I got it.
 -  one of the buoys.

1346
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,520
We need to get on that buoy, right?

1347
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,660
But there are many buoys with the same colour.

1348
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,550
- So we don't know which one.
 -  Right.

1349
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,430
- We should find the right one.
 -  You're right.

1350
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,380
This won't be easy.

1351
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,190
There are many buoys with the same colour.

1352
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,400
So if you win,

1353
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,750
you'll be shown in the biggest section of the monitor.

1354
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,990
Okay.

1355
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,320
The lower your rank, the smaller your section will be.

1356
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,330
(If their ranks are lower, they'll get smaller sections of the screen.)

1357
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,120
(It means, if they don't win,)

1358
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,020
(they'll gradually disappear from the screen.)

1359
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:34,260
(The last mission to get the centre position starts.)

1360
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,430
- Only one team can win.
 -  Okay.

1361
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,120
We can do it!

1362
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,550
Let's find which one will be the main one.

1363
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,750
- We can do it.
 -  In Young, this is it!

1364
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,320
- In Young, this one.
 -  The screen...

1365
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,490
The screen will show...

1366
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,120
- In Young!
 -  Yes.

1367
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,470
Zico, go for it!

1368
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,990
- We can do it.
 -  Get ready.

1369
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,420
- Let's go for it.
 -  In Young, this will be faster.

1370
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,750
(The new couple will get the biggest part.)

1371
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,280
You may start when I blow my whistle.

1372
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,660
(The first round of "Conquer the Main Camera" will start soon.)

1373
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,190
(Red buoy is their target.)

1374
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,360
It's the middle one!

1375
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,520
(Even the ladies dive in.)

1376
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,740
(But which red buoy is it?)

1377
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,890
Which one is it?

1378
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,050
(But which red buoy is it?)

1379
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,160
Go, Su Jin!

1380
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,820
(They must find the right buoy faster than others to win.)

1381
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,560
Which one is it? Is this the one?

1382
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,430
Red one!

1383
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,700
Isn't this the right one?

1384
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,400
(They all go for the red buoy.)

1385
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,690
Hyeon Gyeong! You got it!

1386
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,750
(Hyeon Gyeong gets there first.)

1387
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,030
(Is this the right buoy?)

1388
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,320
(Bingo!)

1389
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,560
Wow.

1390
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,100
Drag her down!

1391
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,040
Push her!

1392
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,250
What's going on?

1393
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,150
(Chaotic)

1394
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,370
(Hyeon Gyeong succeeds to climb on the buoy.)

1395
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,920
(Now, it's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1396
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,190
Hurry up.

1397
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,100
(Now, it's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1398
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,930
Take them down!

1399
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,060
(Hyeon Gyeong falls off.)

1400
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,450
(To conquer the centre, they should conquer the buoy first.)

1401
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,690
What is this mess?

1402
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,190
(To conquer the centre, they should conquer the buoy first.)

1403
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,420
- Jin Young.
 -  Goodness.

1404
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,000
(While everyone is struggling near the buoy,)

1405
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:10,350
(Zico pulls Ji Hyo up.)

1406
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,290
(If they do the heart gesture, they can win the first round.)

1407
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,400
Zico!

1408
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,330
(Success!)

1409
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,720
(Ji Hyo and Zico win the first round.)

1410
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,800
(They get the centre section.)

1411
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,120
You should've stopped her.

1412
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,020
Ji Hyo and Zico won this round.

1413
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,330
In Young, what were you doing?

1414
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,930
In Young, I was right in front.

1415
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,330
- We were so close too.
 -  Kwang Soo!

1416
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,760
How could they succeed?

1417
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,420
I have to give this to them?

1418
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,590
(He loses the whistle.)

1419
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:38,730
Right now?

1420
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,890
No way. I hardly did anything.

1421
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,000
(Was my position a temporary one?)

1422
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,530
From now on,

1423
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,750
Ji Hyo and Zico will be shown at the main section of the screen.

1424
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,180
(Ji Hyo and Zico gets the centre section.)

1425
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,230
(Although it was short, it was nice to be at the centre.)

1426
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,950
This round will decide which team comes in second.

1427
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,050
- All right. We should go this way.
 -  This way.

1428
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,710
Yes, you should dive into the water first.

1429
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:00,790
Start!

1430
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,400
(They blow the whistle.)

1431
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,030
(Diving)

1432
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,760
(This time, it's the yellow buoy.)

1433
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,060
(Stephanie uses a blue buoy as her transportation.)

1434
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
(She slips.)

1435
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,590
(She can't control her body.)

1436
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,760
Which one is it?

1437
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,150
Get moving.

1438
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,420
(All of them move towards the yellow buoys.)

1439
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,460
- I got it.
 -  Where is it?

1440
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,720
Which one is that?

1441
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,090
- It's here!
 -  Gosh, wait.

1442
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,020
(Jong Kook gets the right one.)

1443
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,100
Jin Young, come here!

1444
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,710
- Don't pull me down.
 -  Jin Young.

1445
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,540
(Kwang Soo pinches Jae Seok.)

1446
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,860
(While Kwang Soo distracts Jae Seok, Jong Kook and Seok Jin climb on it.)

1447
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,120
(I won't lose.)

1448
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,260
(Kwang Soo bites Jong Kook.)

1449
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,460
- Jin Young!
 -  Stop!

1450
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,130
That hurts!

1451
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,840
- Don't bite me!
 -  Grab on!

1452
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,320
- Good job!
 -  Stop biting me!

1453
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,200
(He bites into the meat.)

1454
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,550
(How low are you willing to go to win?)

1455
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,920
(We can go as low as possible.)

1456
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,600
(This is war.)

1457
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,330
(It's good that we won the first round.)

1458
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,160
(We can't never let anyone else get the second row.)

1459
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,220
(You got mail!)

1460
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,660
(What a lucky girl she is.)

1461
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,890
(Haha, come over here!)

1462
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,120
(I'm on my way.)

1463
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,620
Stop him!

1464
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,860
(We must stop him.)

1465
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,130
- Don't let him!
 -  Stop him! Stop him!

1466
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,990
(Stephanie, I'll be there soon.)

1467
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,400
(Haha slips.)

1468
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,530
(Too short to reach)

1469
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,720
(How can you be that short?)

1470
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,990
(Come on! It's not too late!)

1471
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,430
Stop him! Not Haha!

1472
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,030
It would've been cool if he succeeded.

1473
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,540
(Su Jin grabs Jae Seok down, using her weight.)

1474
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,700
Who are you?

1475
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,220
(Haha, hold my hand.)

1476
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,690
- Who's on my back?
 -  Su Jin, do it now!

1477
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,990
(Haha loses Stephanie's grasp.)

1478
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,090
No way!

1479
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,600
(Instead of helping her, he makes her fall off.)

1480
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,930
- That is...
 -  Who's on my back?

1481
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,100
Who are you?

1482
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,220
Don't push me down.

1483
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,320
This is driving me crazy!

1484
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,030
- Go!
 -  Let me go!

1485
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,890
Don't push me down! This is driving me crazy!

1486
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,300
She's climbing!

1487
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,800
- They're climbing up!
 -  This is tiring.

1488
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,520
They all are up there.

1489
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,930
- Jong Kook.
 -  What's that?

1490
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,260
(Jong Kook's one blow drops so many people from the buoy.)

1491
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,860
What was that?

1492
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,530
Look at her!

1493
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,180
(Bo Ah never falls from the buoy no matter how steep it becomes.)

1494
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,700
- Hurry up, Seok Jin!
 -  Bo Ah!

1495
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,730
Bo Ah, I'll be there soon.

1496
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,250
(Now, Su Jin changes her target to Kwang Soo.)

1497
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,650
(She is one scary woman.)

1498
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,060
(Let me go up.)

1499
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,650
- Bo Ah, wait for me!
 -  Stop him!

1500
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,150
Don't let him go up!

1501
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,950
(Bo Ah still hangs on the buoy.)

1502
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,860
(Bo Ah, wait a little longer.)

1503
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,990
(The centre couple enjoy seeing them struggle.)

1504
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,120
Come back down!

1505
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,000
(Struggling)

1506
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,000
- Seok Jin!
 -  Hold on, okay?

1507
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,600
- Hold on to it.
 -  Seok Jin!

1508
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,640
What are you doing, Kwang Soo? Where are you going?

1509
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,320
Kwang Soo!

1510
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,260
You'll fall apart.

1511
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,090
This doesn't count.

1512
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,820
(They're having their own competition.)

1513
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,800
Wait for me, Bo Ah!

1514
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,960
(I'll be back, Bo Ah. Wait for me.)

1515
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,720
(Suddenly, Jae Seok reaches for the buoy.)

1516
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,990
Jae Seok is making his way up!

1517
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,800
(Stop Jae Seok!)

1518
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,050
(Hopping)

1519
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,390
(He makes a surprise attack.)

1520
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,720
We did it. We both did it.

1521
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,890
We did it!

1522
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,200
(Jae Seok and In Young takes the win.)

1523
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,890
(Look how unfortunate I am.)

1524
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,960
(I didn't come back in time.)

1525
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:18,260
(Team Jae Seok gets the second row.)

1526
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,190
Let's go right away.

1527
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,450
There's another chance for the second place.

1528
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,870
- There's one more for second place.
 -  All right.

1529
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,860
Watch out for Su Jin.

1530
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,480
Watch out.

1531
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,740
Watch out for Su Jin. This is a word of caution.

1532
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,960
- You held onto my back, right?
 -  Yes.

1533
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,140
I'm sorry, Bo Ah.

1534
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,750
- You had to be fast.
 -  I was so close.

1535
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,490
Let's go again. In one.

1536
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,520
(The third round starts.)

1537
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,060
(Everybody goes for the yellow again.)

1538
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,960
(Splashing)

1539
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,000
(She swims like she's in the Taeneung Training Center.)

1540
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,290
(Hyeon Gyeong moves from one buoy to another.)

1541
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,890
It's this one!

1542
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,600
- It's this one.
 -  Hurry!

1543
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,550
- Kwang Soo.
 -  It's this one!

1544
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,350
- It's this one!
 -  Look at Kwang Soo.

1545
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,620
- Kwang Soo's got it.
 -  It's this one.

1546
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,960
- No, no.
 -  Is that it?

1547
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,090
- Go, go!
 -  Stop pulling me down.

1548
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,150
Stop it.

1549
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,600
Don't give up!

1550
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,430
(I'm here.)

1551
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,620
In 1, 2, 3.

1552
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,430
(Hold on to my hand.)

1553
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,120
(He lifts her up.)

1554
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,450
(He's like a fisherman.)

1555
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,790
In 1, 2, 3. Hurry.

1556
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,790
(They make a heart.)

1557
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,400
(Jong Kook and Jin Young take the win.)

1558
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:48,030
(Jong Kook is incredible.)

1559
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,220
(They clench the second row.)

1560
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,530
I want to go with Jong Kook too.

1561
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,630
- Bo Ah, I'm bleeding.
 -  I want to go with Jong Kook.

1562
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:02,620
Let's keep going.

1563
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,050
(Here's a missing pair of pants.)

1564
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,920
- I found this.
 -  Has anybody lost their shorts?

1565
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,420
(Has anybody lost their shorts?)

1566
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,690
Anybody's shorts?

1567
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,810
(Are those mine?)

1568
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,620
- Who's is it?
 -  Where did your pants go?

1569
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,950
Give it to him.

1570
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,050
Why is he always taking his pants off?

1571
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,670
(Team Ji Hyo is in the centre while Jae Seok and Jong Kook are second.)

1572
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:26,390
Hey, Bo Ah. Watch which buoy it is.

1573
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:29,300
It's going to be two buoys. They're different colours.

1574
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,090
(The targets are one blue buoy and a yellow one.)

1575
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,030
- Get that one.
 -  Check the blue one.

1576
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,410
Come here!

1577
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:45,060
(Thanks to Hyeon Gyeong, Kwang Soo and she takes an easy win.)

1578
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,390
Let's go, Bo Ah.

1579
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:48,620
(There's only one space left in the third row.)

1580
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,190
Bo Ah, you are here.

1581
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,720
We both made it.

1582
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,620
(After a fierce competition,)

1583
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,490
(the three teams make hearts at about the same time.)

1584
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,950
You came in first.

1585
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,520
(Seok Jin and Bo Ah are the winners.)

1586
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,290
Bo Ah. Yes!

1587
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,360
(The rest of the teams are in the fourth row.)

1588
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,860
Hold on. Some of you...

1589
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,700
- They've changed, right?
 -  Yes, a bit.

1590
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,990
Some of you look more beautiful without any make-up.

1591
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,850
Hyeon Gyeong looks prettier without make-up.

1592
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,360
Su Jin as well.

1593
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,120
In Young too.

1594
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,930
- Stephanie's the same.
 -  Jin Young too.

1595
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,090
Zico too.

1596
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,500
- It's everybody.
 -  Zico too?

1597
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,930
- Zico has no make-up on.
 -  You look better like that.

1598
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,750
You look better like that.

1599
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,650
- Look at Bo Ah.
 -  She looks good.

1600
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,690
- You look better without make-up.
 -  That's right.

1601
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:41,120
(In a little while, some of these people...)

1602
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:49,030
(will disappear from the screen without a trace.)

1603
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,300
(Who will be the last one standing?)

1604
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,990
This must be the chance to turn things around.

1605
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,700
- What's all this?
 -  We are in the centre.

1606
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,090
- Come here.
 -  Is this the third row?

1607
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,690
- Come here.
 -  Does it matter if it's 3rd or 4th?

1608
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,980
- It does matter.
 -  This is the second row.

1609
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,370
We're in the second row.

1610
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,500
Are we in the second row?

1611
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,240
Do you have to go now?

1612
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,850
- Pardon?
 -  She has to go first.

1613
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,990
- What? Really?
 -  She was supposed...

1614
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,690
to fly for her next event which would have been enough time.

1615
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:20,690
But the weather hasn't been good, so her flight got cancelled.

1616
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,590
We're sorry to let her go, but she has to take the train.

1617
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:25,840
She has to get going now.

1618
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,790
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
 -  That's all right.

1619
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,590
Good job, Jin Young.

1620
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,000
Great job!

1621
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,740
Good job, everybody.

1622
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,250
- Thumbs up
 -  Thumbs up.

1623
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,750
- See you later, Jin Young.
 -  Good work.

1624
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,730
- Bye.
 -  Good work!

1625
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,690
Jong Kook, you get the camera to yourself.

1626
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,060
That's good.

1627
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,350
(Who's that?)

1628
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,800
The guy at the other end looks like my neighbour.

1629
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,060
- My goodness.
 -  I'm a celebrity.

1630
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,990
A few teams didn't gain a win in the last game.

1631
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,690
This is your chance to flip the table.

1632
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:01,100
- It's called, "Camera On/Off".
 -  "Camera On/Off".

1633
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,530
- What is it?
 -  It's "On/Off".

1634
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,220
You can bet points you've earned...

1635
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,520
and gain bonus points.

1636
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,320
- There are cameras on both sides.
 -  They're here.

1637
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,750
If you disconnect one of the cords,

1638
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,900
the screen will either stay on or turn off.

1639
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,930
We have to unplug one of them.

1640
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,390
- I'm really bad at this.
 -  It's up to luck.

1641
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,930
Yes, if the screen doesn't go off you get twice the points you bet,

1642
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:30,850
but if it goes off, you lose all the points you bet.

1643
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,120
You have to be wise about this.

1644
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,320
You can only bet from the points you've earned.

1645
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,300
Like I said before, the penalty has to do with the blue screen...

1646
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,060
It's chroma key.

1647
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,750
Are you really going to do this?

1648
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,590
- What's all this?
 -  It's a penalty.

1649
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,470
- Is this paint?
 -  This is too much.

1650
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,410
(Who will fall to humiliation?)

1651
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:53,350
Look. Haha and Stephanie will bet everything they have.

1652
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,720
- Would they?
 -  Of course.

1653
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,350
- Gary and Su Jin...
 -  They'll bet everything too.

1654
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,650
- I'm betting everything.
 -  You need 10 points at least.

1655
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,750
We bet five points.

1656
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,290
This is all-in.

1657
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,120
- They're betting five points.
 -  We'll bet everything too.

1658
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,330
- How many do you have?
 -  We have four points.

1659
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,230
- Then, we'll start with Haha.
 -  Okay!

1660
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,390
- Let's do this.
 -  Let's watch them first.

1661
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,800
Should we watch them first?

1662
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,370
- We'll go.
 -  It's either 1 or 2.

1663
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:20,090
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1664
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:21,420
Make up your mind!

1665
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,630
(Stephanie chooses number one.)

1666
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,120
(On or off)

1667
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,160
Make up your mind!

1668
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,160
(How will the monitor respond?)

1669
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,050
(Oh, no!)

1670
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,850
(It turned off!)

1671
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,490
- We are good now.
 -  Yes.

1672
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,820
(They bet everything.)

1673
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,890
(He's stunned.)

1674
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:44,650
- It's done now.
 -  We got this.

1675
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,100
- We are good.
 -  There's a good chance.

1676
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
This is for real.

1677
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,820
- I'm glad we got rid of them.
 -  They get the last place.

1678
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,850
Gary and Su Jin, you're fourth row. How many points are you betting?

1679
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,620
- We'll bet all 4 points.
 -  They are betting 4 points.

1680
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,930
- This is your last chance.
 -  It'll be double or nothing.

1681
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:01,430
In one...

1682
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,150
Two...

1683
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,390
(Su Jin succeeds.)

1684
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,800
They did it.

1685
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,390
That's amazing.

1686
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,690
They have eight points now.

1687
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:12,130
- We'll bet everything.
 -  I hope they don't take it.

1688
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,490
- It's all or nothing?
 -  That's it.

1689
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:17,620
- I hope the screen goes off.
 -  We need another loser.

1690
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,210
- Go for it!
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1691
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,550
(She unplugs number two.)

1692
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,290
(It's all or nothing.)

1693
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,890
(What is the result?)

1694
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,300
(The monitor stays on.)

1695
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,800
(Seok Jin and Bo Ah earn bonus points.)

1696
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,150
(I'm doomed.)

1697
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,300
That's 14 points.

1698
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,120
- My goodness.
 -  You have to bet all you have.

1699
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,800
We'll bet 7 points and leave 1 point.

1700
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,050
- It's okay.
 -  You never know.

1701
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,800
- Okay, Kwang Soo.
 -  I hope it goes off this time.

1702
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:48,050
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Turn off.

1703
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:51,720
(They choose number one.)

1704
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,340
(The monitor stays on.)

1705
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,540
- Oh, my goodness.
 -  Why did so many stay on?

1706
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,850
It's 15 points.

1707
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,090
- Wow.
 -  They get the first place.

1708
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,350
(Who knew Kwang Soo will get lucky this time?)

1709
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:01,850
How many went off?

1710
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,320
(They climb up to the first place.)

1711
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,900
We'll bet eight points.

1712
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,590
We'll bet eight.

1713
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,000
Make us laugh.

1714
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,650
You're only betting eight? You won't come in last.

1715
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:13,890
In Young says she's really bad at this. Same goes for me.

1716
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,850
I never pick the right one.

1717
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:18,120
- I recommend number two.
 -  In Young, don't listen to him.

1718
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,660
- I say two.
 -  Just pick whichever you want.

1719
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,180
- Have you made up your mind?
 -  Please!

1720
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,620
- Please.
 -  In Young, trust your instincts.

1721
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,390
- Just go with your instincts.
 -  Trust your instincts.

1722
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,120
- Hey, think again.
 -  In one...

1723
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,990
- Did you think it over?
 -  Turn off. Please.

1724
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:33,140
- Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Please don't go off.

1725
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,760
(The screen is out.)

1726
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:39,050
(The monitor goes off.)

1727
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:43,760
(They're always unlucky.)

1728
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,520
- Way to go.
 -  They were in the first place.

1729
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,670
- Oh, gosh.
 -  I only need two points.

1730
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,430
Come on, In Young.

1731
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,880
- I bet five points.
 -  I'll beat you again.

1732
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,150
Okay, I'll bet 5 points and leave 2 behind.

1733
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,790
Are you ready?

1734
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,650
- Yes.
 -  We'll start.

1735
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,820
- I hope he doesn't get it.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1736
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,950
- Turn off.
 -  Go!

1737
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,490
(He chooses number one. What is the result?)

1738
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:12,250
(The monitor stays on.)

1739
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,970
(Exclaiming)

1740
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:16,990
It was always number two for me from the moment I walked in here.

1741
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,660
This is why I hate him.

1742
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,560
What are you complaining about?

1743
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,670
- Kwang Soo's team is first place.
 -  Yes.

1744
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,650
Seok Jin's team is second place, right?

1745
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,420
- You have to bet everything.
 -  Please.

1746
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,210
What happens if we bet everything and then lose it all?

1747
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,950
Then they won't be last place any more.

1748
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,590
Either way, bet everything.

1749
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,400
This kid is really not that bold.

1750
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,860
Bet it all

1751
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,120
- It's all or nothing.
 -  They're tempting you.

1752
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,290
(Don't get swayed.)

1753
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,220
- Really?
 -  Bet it all

1754
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,120
- Bet it all.
 -  It's all or nothing.

1755
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,220
- Ji Hyo is good at these things.
 -  But...

1756
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,820
- Zico, you got dragged into this.
 -  I take risks.

1757
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,250
- That's right.
 -  It suits you.

1758
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,450
- It's all or nothing.
 -  I can do this, right?

1759
01:09:58,450 --> 01:09:59,820
- All right.
 -  I'm confident.

1760
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,990
- Believe in yourself.
 -  I won't regret after.

1761
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,200
- Let's do this.
 -  Let's go.

1762
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,920
- Would things turn around?
 -  Let's watch the monitor.

1763
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,200
- In 3, 2, 1.
 -  In 3, 2, 1.

1764
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,390
(They choose number 2.)

1765
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,200
(Please let them fail.)

1766
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,930
(The monitor stays on.)

1767
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,290
(Ji Hyo and Zico succeed this mission.)

1768
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:25,700
- We did it. We have 16 points!
 -  Yes!

1769
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,530
- We are first place.
 -  Seriously, Ji Hyo?

1770
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,110
- This is perfect.
 -  You two are incredible.

1771
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,190
Look at you two.

1772
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,130
Why is Haha's team on our screen?

1773
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,630
- I'm not on my screen either.
 -  Kwang Soo is on our screen.

1774
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,670
- This is irritating.
 -  Hold on.

1775
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,800
There's a twist at the end!

1776
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,320
(I think there was something suspicious.)

1777
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,330
Am I wrong? There's nothing?

1778
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,680
Come on.

1779
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,820
- You got me.
 -  There's no twist to this.

1780
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,830
- I thought...
 -  What are you trying to do?

1781
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,930
- You sounded so hopeful.
 -  My heart was racing.

1782
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,320
- You were so nonchalant.
 -  That's right.

1783
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,560
(We will make twists from now on.)

1784
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,170
(Ji Hyo and Zico are the ultimate centre couple.)

1785
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,800
This is making me nervous.

1786
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,600
- Stephanie and Haha are last place.
 -  We are second row.

1787
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,730
- Thank goodness we're second.
 -  My goodness.

1788
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,820
Centre, centre

1789
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,020
- Are you second?
 -  How did we end up last?

1790
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,990
- I'm third row.
 -  Please stand behind the box.

1791
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:34,540
All couples except the centre couple...

1792
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,840
- will open the boxes. Open them.
 -  Open them.

1793
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,460
Gosh, what's this?

1794
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,790
(These blue outfits will make them blend in.)

1795
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:43,990
It's just the top.

1796
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,930
You want us to put this on our faces?

1797
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:48,600
Isn't this too much?

1798
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,800
(Paint for colouring their faces)

1799
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:51,990
- This is your punishment.
 -  But...

1800
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,630
I like these pants. They're comfortable.

1801
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,530
Can I have them?

1802
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,990
They're good, right?

1803
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,830
(Gary does Zico's dance in his comfortable pants.)

1804
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,200
- I should wear these to Itaewon.
 -  In Young.

1805
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:06,530
You don't have to put these on.

1806
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,220
(Either way, these won't make you look pretty.)

1807
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:12,160
This is nice. This looks so nice.

1808
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,360
- It looks nice on you.
 -  It does.

1809
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,620
- They look really nice.
 -  Why is it always you and me?

1810
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,190
- I'm so mad.
 -  It just had to be these.

1811
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,690
I want to see this again.

1812
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:24,860
- There's a show in Las Vegas.
 -  Go away.

1813
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,690
- They're called Blue Man Group.
 -  Go away.

1814
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:30,730
- I'm being serious.
 -  Do we do this too?

1815
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,330
They're called Blue Man Group.

1816
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,400
- Girls should get painted.
 -  I can do it.

1817
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:38,490
- Are you painting his entire face?
 -  You're supposed to.

1818
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,100
- Can you do it?
 -  He disappeared.

1819
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,030
- He's more handsome this way.
 -  Can I try it?

1820
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,620
(She wants to give it a try.)

1821
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,000
Do you think I'm a merchandise?

1822
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,170
Do it for her too. Do it for Stephanie.

1823
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,050
No, draw something pretty. Draw a heart.

1824
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,490
I'm so relieved we didn't come in last.

1825
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:59,820
- What just happened?
 -  I didn't know it was this bad.

1826
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,130
(Shocking)

1827
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,750
- Are you okay?
 -  He doesn't look okay.

1828
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,550
- They're going to disappear now.
 -  All right.

1829
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,060
- They're gone.
 -  Wow.

1830
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,860
Haha and I are here for sure.

1831
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,670
- I only see your eyes.
 -  We'll keep going.

1832
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,620
- Squids!
 -  They're squids!

1833
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,410
(The change the background into squids.)

1834
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,130
(Where are you, Gary?)

1835
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,400
We'll end off today with my partner's song.

1836
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,420
Let's play Block B's new song.

1837
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,600
Okay, everybody. Great work!

1838
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,000
Block B!

1839
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,300
(The chroma key changes the scene into a night club.)

1840
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,120
(You can't see them but they are dancing.)

1841
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,300
We disappeared!

1842
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,700
Where are you? I can't see.

1843
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:49,130
(Stephanie is shrugging her shoulders.)

1844
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,060
- What are you guys doing?
 -  People can't even see you.

1845
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,330
(It's a world where only those in the centre stand out.)

1846
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,660
- I'm a toy
 -  We can only see Zico.

1847
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,700
(Survival of the centres)

1848
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:10,210
(Thank you to all the guests who made all of us laugh.)

1849
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:17,260
(7 years, 71 months, 2142 days, 300 episodes)

1850
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,180
(7 vs 300)

1851
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,960
(This is the biggest mission ever.)

1852
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:28,510
(Running Men warriors are not afraid of anything.)

1853
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,670
(They're not afraid of being humiliated.)

1854
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,300
(300 warriors challenge them.)

1855
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,930
(And)

1856
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,560
(Don't be deceived.)

1857
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,840
(The members took the bait.)

1858
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,060
