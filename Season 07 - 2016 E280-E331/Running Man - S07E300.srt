1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,840
(July 11, 2010)

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,250
Don't walk, but run. Running Man.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,190
(This is how the history began.)

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:27,490
(6 springs, summers, autumns and winters)

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,840
(6 years)

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,990
(6 years ago, Kwang Soo was a 26-year-old nameless actor.)

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,560
(With 7 million Chinese followers on SNS, he's the Prince of Asia now.)

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,320
(And...)

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,790
(Ji Hyo and Gary used to be awkward with one another.)

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,590
(Now, they've become the Monday Couple and lifelong friends.)

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,080
(On the other hand,)

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,850
(40-year-old Seok Jin who felt nervous to join an outdoor show...)

13
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,360
(has now become a guaranteed "Race Starter".)

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,310
(Also,)

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,510
(Haha, who confessed his love to every female guest,)

16
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,490
(met a woman and confessed his eternal love to her.)

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,160
(71 months)

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,180
(Jong Kook showed his amazing strength for the last 71 months.)

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,580
(He hasn't changed.)

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,180
(Jae Seok, who was standing in the centre for the last 71 months,)

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,180
(has realised that he is a centre-seeker.)

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,250
(2,142 days)

23
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,120
(Many guests have joined Running Man for the last 2,142 days.)

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,760
We don't look the same.

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,090
Really?

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,780
(650 guests)

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,090
When did you become so cute?

28
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,210
(The Running Man team visited various countries around the world.)

29
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,520
(Thailand)

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
(China)

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,280
(Australia)

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,680
(Macau)

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,050
(Vietnam)

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,530
(Hong Kong)

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,460
(Running Man's 300th episode begins today.)

36
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,420
(The beginning of an unexpected, but dangerous challenge)

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,690
("300" is the enemy that the 7 Running Man members must defeat.)

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,690
(Imagination becomes reality, and reality becomes a nightmare.)

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,990
(They took the bait.)

40
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,850
(In the darkness, there are traps set up for the Running Man members.)

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,250
(If a member gets caught in a trap, the darkness deepens.)

42
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,820
(Escape, if you can.)

43
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,060
(P tower in Sangam)

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,780
(A 3 tier cake is prepared to celebrate the 300th episode.)

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,660
- Wow, look at that.
 -  Hello.

46
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,180
(There are 300 nameplates with all the episode titles of Running Man.)

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,090
(Here, you can see the 6-year history of Running Man at once.)

48
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,460
- These are all the episodes.
 -  "Mafia Game".

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,660
- That's the first episode.
 -  This is touching.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,510
- We went through so many episodes.
 -  This is quite touching.

51
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,710
- There are so many.
 -  What is this?

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,850
I can't remember this episode.

53
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,320
This episode was the best. Yu Bond Spin Off Virus.

54
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,290
I think this episode was the best. First Love Race was the best.

55
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,650
Do you remember? In this episode, Boarders of 2014, Guk Joo joined us.

56
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,110
Really?

57
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,980
(It was a strong women special that is hard to forget.)

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,960
The Supernatural Baseball episode is here.

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,710
- Supernatural Baseball was fun.
 -  It was really fun.

60
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,060
(MLB players Ryu Hyun Jin and Choo Shin Soo joined this episode.)

61
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,410
Choi Min Soo was in Grasshopper Hunting, right?

62
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,450
- That's right.
 -  It was really amazing.

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,050
- It was really scary.
 -  When was it aired?

64
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,180
The grasshopper was really scary.

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,180
- I was scared, too.
 -  It was so long ago.

66
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,080
This was Sherlock Holmes. Seok Jin ruined this episode. Remember?

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,380
- It was a big mess.
 -  It was the 79th episode.

68
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,680
(Seok Jin played a crucial role.)

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,120
First Love Race.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,460
Will we ever have a First Love Race again?

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,210
(Haha spent a good time with Han Ga In.)

72
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,200
I have a good memory of that episode.

73
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,010
There is a question mark for the 300th episode.

74
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,590
It's because today's the 300th.

75
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,250
Wow, it's 300.

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,390
300th.

77
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,880
Today is the 300th episode.

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,710
Congratulations.

79
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,950
First, we'd like to show our gratitude to all the viewers.

80
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,350
- Thank you.
 -  Really.

81
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,650
- We'll try harder from now on.
 -  It's a special day.

82
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,210
- We must try harder.
 -  Of course.

83
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,780
Come to think of it, we've spent a long time together.

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,190
- We really have.
 -  It has been 300 weeks.

85
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,760
There's a question mark on the title of the 300th episode.

86
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,780
Please remove the sticker and reveal today's mission.

87
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,080
By ourselves?

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,890
- By ourselves?
 -  Please remove the sticker.

89
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,750
Today's episode must be like a blockbuster episode. Right?

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,260
- I'm really looking forward to it.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

91
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:27,720
(What is today's 300th episode special?)

92
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,480
- What?
 -  "7 vs 300"?

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,810
(7 vs 300?)

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,080
- 7 vs 300?
 -  What is this?

95
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,350
What is this about?

96
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,510
- How can we beat 300 people?
 -  Today's special...

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,080
is the 300th Episode Special: 7 vs 300.

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,890
From now, for two days,

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,520
you will go through missions related to the number 300.

100
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,910
If you successfully complete each mission,

101
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,580
we will give you puzzle pieces for hints...

102
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,050
that are essential for the final mission.

103
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,250
If you fail a mission, you will be heavily penalised...

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,680
according to the mission you've failed.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,420
So please work together for the missions ahead.

106
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,590
(So this isn't a 300th episode celebration.)

107
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,310
This is the 300th episode, so you'll be rewarded with a completion fee.

108
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,750
A completion fee?

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,080
- Will they give us 3,000 dollars?
 -  Because it is the 300th episode,

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,790
we will reward you 3,000 dollars.

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Oh my goodness.

112
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,690
- Really?
 -  3,000 dollars?

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,980
- Can we really take the money?
 -  Oh my goodness.

114
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,710
(3,000 dollars in cash)

115
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,620
- Oh my goodness!
 -  It's real.

116
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,890
- Really?
 -  Is it real money?

117
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,820
- What's so special today?
 -  Even if we share it equally...

118
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,110
(The completion fee is exceptional. It's 430 dollars for each member.)

119
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,380
The first mission of today's 7 vs 300 special will be revealed.

120
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,520
(The first mission is revealed.)

121
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,750
(What is the first mission with the completion fee of 3,000 dollars?)

122
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,960
The first mission will be revealed now.

123
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,580
- Dollars?
 -  3,000 dollars?

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,050
(300th Episode Special: 7 vs 3,000 dollars)

125
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,490
3,000 dollars?

126
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,510
This must be the bet of the game.

127
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,580
(How will they compete against the completion fee?)

128
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,160
Everyone, from now on,

129
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,850
if you remove the sticker on the title of each episode...

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,280
on the nameplates around you,

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,650
you will find a quiz for each episode.

132
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,180
Every member has to solve a quiz, so there are seven quizzes in total.

133
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,350
The completion fee will be reduced by...

134
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,660
10 dollars for every second that is passed.

135
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,910
- 10 dollars for every second?
 -  One second?

136
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,980
- Do we have the first mission here?
 -  It means you're not paying us.

137
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,810
- Just tell us that you won't.
 -  We must get all the answers right.

138
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,950
No, if you hurry, you can take quite a bit of money with you.

139
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,680
- We only have 300 seconds.
 -  It means we have 5 minutes.

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,260
Is the quiz related to the episode...

141
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,480
- that we choose?
 -  Choose the ones you remember.

142
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,380
For example, choose an episode that you played a crucial role in.

143
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,590
- We should choose carefully.
 -  I will choose the First Love Race.

144
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,250
(299 episodes were aired for the last 6 years.)

145
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,390
(To win, they must remember what they did on those episodes.)

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
(How many episodes will the members remember out of 300?)

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,380
Let's do the 7012nd episode first.

148
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,010
- That's the most recent one.
 -  A recent one is a good idea.

149
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,250
- Right.
 -  Then...

150
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,410
Let's start with 7012 special.

151
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,580
Let's decide the order.

152
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,550
Let's line up first. The one in front of the line runs first and...

153
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,710
- Okay.
 -  Then,

154
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,780
- Haha will go first.
 -  Me? All right.

155
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,010
Start.

156
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,050
(The first runner is Haha.)

157
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,690
(How much out of 3,000 dollars will they get?)

158
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,910
(The Running Man Quiz has 299 questions.)

159
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,150
Start!

160
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,960
(The Running Man Quiz has begun.)

161
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,860
- Hurry.
 -  Look, they take a dollar every...

162
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,110
"Who was the guest that was Han Ga In's first love?"

163
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,820
(Haha chooses Episode 87, First Love Race.)

164
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,080
(Who was the guest that was Han Ga In's first love?)

165
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,310
It's me, Haha.

166
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,890
(Me, Haha)

167
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,800
(Haha had a great time with Ga In 4 years ago in 2012.)

168
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,420
(Haha chose the episode that Ga In joined as a guest.)

169
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,580
My first love.

170
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,760
(Will Ga In's first love be Haha?)

171
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
It's me, Haha.

172
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,840
- Correct.
 -  Okay.

173
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,810
- Good.
 -  Choose the one you can remember.

174
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,280
- Where is the Avengers episode?
 -  Hey,

175
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,050
- find the one you remember now.
 -  Find them in advance.

176
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,050
(Gary chooses Episode 81, Gary Knows.)

177
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,360
- You're too short.
 -  Hey!

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,520
"Where in England did Gary shoot 'Gary Potter'?"

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,620
Do you know the answer?

180
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,740
- Do you remember it?
 -  You should know the answer.

181
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,080
- Hurry, Gary.
 -  Hey.

182
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,580
- Hurry up.
 -  Say anything that comes to mind.

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,150
- Gary.
 -  I don't know.

184
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,180
- What are you doing?
 -  Manchester.

185
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,280
- Just say anything.
 -  Pass. Ji Hyo.

186
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,010
- Let me go for it.
 -  Try to remember.

187
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,150
- What was the name of that station?
 -  I'll choose "Avengers".

188
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,380
- "Which guest became a super hero?"
 -  What was the name of the station?

189
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,680
- Who became a super hero?
 -  That's him.

190
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,080
- It is...
 -  Seok Jin.

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,620
- Wait. Who was he?
 -  I think...

192
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,490
It is...

193
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,180
So can we share our powers now?

194
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,260
(The one who visited Running Man "Avengers" was...)

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
Come at me!

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,160
(Super hero, Choo Sung Hoon)

197
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,910
(Has Ji Hyo forgotten such a furious hero?)

198
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,590
- Wait. Who was he?
 -  I think...

199
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,780
It was...

200
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,790
(Come on. Who was he?)

201
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,420
Hey, look at how fast the money is going down.

202
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,580
Choo Sung Hoon.

203
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,850
- I got it right.
 -  Good.

204
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,930
Hurry!

205
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,310
(Seok Jin chooses Episode 79, Sherlock Holmes.)

206
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,800
"Which comedian team visited us to perform on the treasure ship?"

207
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,170
Who were they?

208
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,660
- They're...
 -  My goodness.

209
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,420
- I remember a dog. Who were they?
 -  Right.

210
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,790
- Goodness!
 -  There was a dog.

211
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,240
- Boksil.
 -  Can others answer this question?

212
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,780
- Come on. Tell me.
 -  My goodness. Hurry.

213
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,930
Goodness. I'll go for it. You're unbelievable.

214
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,520
Gosh, where's mine?

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,810
Where's the one I picked?

216
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,090
(Jae Seok is in confusion.)

217
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,280
- Where is it?
 -  That's the one...

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
- It is...
 -  Just pick any!

219
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,850
- Right. Just choose one.
 -  Right.

220
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,480
- You should've decided earlier.
 -  Just take it off.

221
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,650
("Which phrase does Kim Su Ro hate the most?")

222
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,790
- What?
 -  What does he hate the most?

223
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,680
- He is...
 -  I can't remember that.

224
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,060
I don't know. No one can remember that.

225
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,490
Wouldn't it be a swear word?

226
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,380
- Just give up.
 -  How am I supposed...

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,580
It reached 2,000 dollars already. Hurry.

228
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,350
- I can't remember.
 -  Then get out.

229
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,620
- Pass.
 -  What was the answer?

230
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,330
- You can never beat Jong Kook.
 -  What are you talking about?

231
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,080
That's what he hates to hear the most.

232
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,950
(The answer is "You can never beat Jong Kook.")

233
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,220
- What's this?
 -  Choose before your turn comes.

234
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,290
- Which one should I choose?
 -  Jung Woo Sung.

235
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,390
"How many CCTVs did Jung Woo Sung use to monitor the members?"

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,350
(Jung Woo Sung visited Running Man as the King of Terror in 2013.)

237
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,550
(How many CCTVs did he use in the episode?)

238
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,580
(How many CCTVs did Woo Sung use to watch over the members?)

239
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,060
Gosh, this is pretty exciting.

240
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,410
"How many CCTVs did Jung Woo Sung use to monitor the members?"

241
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,850
- Gosh.
 -  What is that?

242
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,990
- Just guess.
 -  There were a lot.

243
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,610
(It's a hard question even for Jong Kook.)

244
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,710
How many were there?

245
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,180
108?

246
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,750
(Were there 108?)

247
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,110
(Is...)

248
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,010
(108...)

249
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,120
(the answer?)

250
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,290
"You're the King of Revenge."

251
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,440
"There are 108 CCTVs inside the building."

252
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,180
"You can use 108 of them."

253
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,490
(The answer is 108.)

254
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,560
- How many were they?
 -  108?

255
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,100
- How did you know that?
 -  You're great.

256
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,250
(Is he human?)

257
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,980
- How does he remember that?
 -  How can he remember that?

258
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,750
- How did you remember the number?
 -  Gosh.

259
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,560
How could you remember the number exactly?

260
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,260
My goodness. Do you watch previous episodes every day?

261
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,960
Jong Kook must be a huge fan of Running Man.

262
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,620
I'll choose Happy Kwang Soo's Day.

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,680
"What was Kwang Soo doing when the members invaded his house?"

264
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,690
How did you know it was 108?

265
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,280
"What was Kwang Soo doing when the members invaded his house?"

266
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
- I know the answer.
 -  I was brushing my teeth.

267
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,580
Kwang Soo, it's me.

268
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,950
(The members visited Kwang Soo's place without warning.)

269
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,990
Kwang Soo.

270
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,220
(Kwang Soo opened the door with toothpaste on his mouth.)

271
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,650
- I was brushing my teeth!
 -  You're right!

272
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,750
- Yes!
 -  Good.

273
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,910
- Hurry!
 -  Run!

274
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,110
Hurry up.

275
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,150
(They got 4 questions correct. They need 3 more to succeed.)

276
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,310
- Wait.
 -  Jong Kook.

277
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,410
Do you watch Running Man every day?

278
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,080
- He looks...
 -  "What did Sung Kyun's t-shirt..."

279
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,150
("What did Sung Kyun's humiliating t-shirt say?")

280
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,220
I remember this.

281
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,390
It's "I'm younger than Haha."

282
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,350
- Yes!
 -  Good.

283
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,620
(The answer is "I'm younger than Haha.")

284
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
Hurry. The money is going down!

285
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,980
- Hurry.
 -  It's 1,600 dollars.

286
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,210
What did you choose?

287
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,280
- Hidden camera?
 -  What is hidden camera?

288
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
("Who were the two people that revealed the hidden camera?")

289
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,710
(They had a Treasure Hunt Race in Australia in 2014.)

290
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,410
(The two guests who had joined the Adventure in Australia were...)

291
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,980
(regular guest, Kim Woo Bin,"

292
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,080
(and the world star, RAIN.)

293
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,560
(Will Gary remember who he was with in Australia 2 years ago?)

294
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,090
- Who were they?
 -  I got it.

295
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,490
RAIN and...

296
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,020
- Hurry.
 -  Kim Woo Bin.

297
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,160
- Wow.
 -  That's correct.

298
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,780
(The last question of the 7 vs 300 Quiz)

299
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,860
- Choose the one you remember.
 -  What's wrong with you?

300
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,250
"What did Seok Jin have to buy at the rest stop?"

301
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,050
- What did he have to buy?
 -  Gosh, this one is difficult.

302
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,650
- This is really difficult.
 -  I can't remember it either.

303
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,940
- I can't remember it.
 -  Was it food?

304
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,190
Was it fish cake?

305
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,150
- My goodness.
 -  It's my turn!

306
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,700
- We need to answer seven questions.
 -  Did you get yours right?

307
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,910
- You already got it right.
 -  Right.

308
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,980
Isn't it my turn?

309
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,390
"What was Cha In Pyo's rail bike mission?"

310
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,380
- What is this?
 -  What's a rail bike mission?

311
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,010
- It's 1,200 dollars now.
 -  He did that with you.

312
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,250
He did that with me.

313
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,480
- What's the mission?
 -  Do you not remember?

314
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,950
Didn't you eat something?

315
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,050
You made tteokbokki.

316
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,260
It's tteokbokki.

317
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,680
(They had to re-enact a scene from "Peppermint Candy".)

318
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,410
Choose the one right up there. Jae Seok!

319
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,680
Jae Seok, choose your special.

320
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,030
Okay. Good.

321
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,240
Gosh, he remembers nothing.

322
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,760
- Pick it!
 -  Go for it!

323
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,690
(Why is Jae Seok so lost?)

324
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,590
Take it off.

325
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,980
- "Which disease did Gary want..."
 -  "Which disease did Gary..."

326
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,480
- "to treat?"
 -  What was that?

327
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,910
- Isn't it piles?
 -  Mythomania.

328
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,560
- That's not correct.
 -  Gosh.

329
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,360
I want to get rid of my celebrity disease.

330
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,080
- Really?
 -  I never thought you'd have that.

331
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,590
I used to have it before.

332
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,280
- Is he a spy?
 -  Why would I have mythomania?

333
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,650
- "Who appeared with psychic power?"
 -  I don't know.

334
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,910
- Is it celebrity disease?
 -  Who is it?

335
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,990
Choose another one.

336
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,480
- Go, run!
 -  Gosh.

337
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,660
Folk Tale of Nine-Tailed Fox!

338
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,610
Where is it?

339
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,210
It's right there. The nine-tailed fox.

340
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,710
"Which part of Kim Soo Mi's body is as sharp as a big nail?"

341
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,580
- Gosh!
 -  I don't know!

342
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,350
- A big nail?
 -  Did she mention it?

343
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,010
My elbow is as sharp and hard as a big nail.

344
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,090
(The answer is her elbows.)

345
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,580
- "Who was hit by Wax's leek?"
 -  What is this?

346
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,480
It's him. Kim Tae Hee's brother.

347
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,650
"Here's my sword!"

348
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,510
(The answer is annulled due to Haha's cheating.)

349
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,580
- Gosh.
 -  Choose a recent one.

350
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,280
Don't choose a recent one. Pick an old one.

351
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,850
Gosh, it's 600 dollars now.

352
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,710
"What was the shape of the rice ball eaten by the one who ranked fourth?"

353
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,810
- Gosh.
 -  "What was the shape?"

354
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,400
- You've got to be kidding me.
 -  This is weird.

355
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,510
- It is.
 -  It had a heart shape.

356
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,560
It's a heart shape, you fool.

357
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,390
"What did Evra say in Korean?"

358
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,910
What did he say?

359
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,050
- He said, "It's tasty".
 -  Jae Seok, I say this a lot.

360
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,320
(What did Evra say in Korean?)

361
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,850
(Evra said something to PD Ko Dong Wan who was in female attire.)

362
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,080
You're so funny.

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,210
(You're funny.)

364
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,450
- "You're so funny."
 -  What did he say?

365
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,780
He said, "You're so funny."

366
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,820
He said "You're so funny".

367
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,380
(Do you remember when Evra said, "You're so funny"?)

368
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,790
- "I love you"? "That's a lie"?
 -  Isn't it "Cool"?

369
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,760
- It's not the answer.
 -  What did he say?

370
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,520
My goodness. It is driving me crazy.

371
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,410
- Gosh.
 -  Why are the questions so hard?

372
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,510
- We are done for.
 -  We have only 370 dollars now.

373
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,580
- This one.
 -  You know this one.

374
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,910
- You know the answer, right?
 -  Good.

375
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,180
- Come on.
 -  It's Announcer Kim Hwan.

376
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
(Who was the commentator of Running Man Olympics' opening ceremony?)

377
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,860
- No way.
 -  I will be today's commentator.

378
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,910
I am Jung Jae Hyung.

379
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,250
- Don't you remember?
 -  Choose one from there.

380
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,680
- My money!
 -  Choose "I am MC Yoo".

381
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,210
- Great.
 -  This is driving me crazy.

382
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,810
- Do it quickly.
 -  Jae Seok!

383
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,760
"Who is the guest who visited in place of Cho Jung Chi?"

384
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,990
It's his wife.

385
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,560
- Who?
 -  Jung In.

386
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,980
- Is it wrong?
 -  No way.

387
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,450
My goodness.

388
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,790
(The answer is Eddy Kim.)

389
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,820
- Hurry!
 -  Isn't it Eddy Kim?

390
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,050
- What is it?
 -  Hurry up.

391
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,400
- "What did Yoo Ah In cook?"
 -  We ran out of money. It's over.

392
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,980
- Yoo Ah In...
 -  We have no money left. It's over.

393
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,650
(What did Ah In cook?)

394
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,220
(Ah In cooked something spicy and sweet.)

395
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,990
(What did he cook?)

396
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,510
(I think I can remember.)

397
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,710
- It's...
 -  He doesn't know.

398
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,980
- Hurry.
 -  I don't remember.

399
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,860
- Gosh.
 -  This is ridiculous!

400
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,910
(This is ridiculous.)

401
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,610
- We failed!
 -  I can't believe this.

402
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,680
(The answer is galbi stew.)

403
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,280
- Gosh.
 -  You're making me really mad.

404
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,810
- How can you not know anything?
 -  Jong Kook remembered 108.

405
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,620
- Gosh.
 -  How can you not remember anything?

406
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,010
- My goodness.
 -  The questions were...

407
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,480
- He is weird.
 -  He is.

408
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,780
- I'm disappointed.
 -  He's so weird.

409
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,890
Is this Jong Kook versus Jae Seok?

410
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,380
It was a practice game, wasn't it?

411
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,270
- How could he get nothing right?
 -  Goodness.

412
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,510
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

413
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,170
It's amazing that Jae Seok remembers nothing.

414
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,150
But it's more amazing that Jong Kook knew the exact number of cameras.

415
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,250
- How could you remember that?
 -  That was amazing.

416
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,380
- I remember there were 108 of them.
 -  Goodness.

417
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,310
Jong Kook must be a big fan of Running Man.

418
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,580
- Jae Seok...
 -  Is he a famous blogger?

419
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,010
I couldn't remember anything.

420
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,080
Now, I remember that.

421
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,180
I was confused with another episode.

422
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,080
I can't believe that Jae Seok didn't remember anything.

423
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,150
- You're right.
 -  But I really couldn't think of it.

424
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,110
And I was pressed for time.

425
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,650
Remit 430 dollars to everyone's accounts.

426
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,810
(He needs to pay 430 dollars each.)

427
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,710
If the money is divided, it's exactly 430 dollars each.

428
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,180
- This is unbelievable.
 -  Goodness.

429
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,760
- We could've made it.
 -  It was really close.

430
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,280
I'll be mistaken as a spy.

431
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,050
- Aren't you a spy?
 -  You must be.

432
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,910
If you didn't know the answer, you should have moved on.

433
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,880
I did, but I still failed!

434
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,980
If you didn't know, you shouldn't have gone back and forth.

435
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,450
- You should've moved on.
 -  But...

436
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,880
This is what I think.

437
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,410
If you rip one and don't know the answer, rip the next one.

438
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,010
Keep going until you find the one you know.

439
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,350
Why would you say you don't know and come up...

440
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,550
(Why would you say you don't know?)

441
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,290
(Hesitating)

442
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,850
- He's right.
 -  That's right.

443
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,120
- What was that for?
 -  He's right on the dot.

444
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,460
He was trying to be cute.

445
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,980
- Oh, gosh.
 -  Were you right or wrong?

446
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,420
Were you right or wrong? Say it.

447
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,180
You ruined the 300th episode.

448
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,840
How could you not know?

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,680
There's no way he couldn't remember.

450
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,880
- I seriously had no idea.
 -  No way. You would know.

451
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,850
We should have kept at least 1,500 dollars.

452
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,960
(What's the truth behind this?)

453
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,180
(What's the second mission?)

454
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,810
What's this about?

455
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,850
I'm being accused as a spy. This is not fair.

456
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,150
- I was flustered so it's possible.
 -  I have my eyes on you.

457
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,780
- I almost ripped your name tag.
 -  My goodness.

458
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,980
- Let me reveal the second mission.
 -  Okay.

459
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,860
- Watch the LED screen behind you.
 -  Oh, dear.

460
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,220
You prepared an LED screen?

461
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,690
This is something different.

462
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,250
Running Man always impresses me.

463
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,290
(What is...)

464
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,360
(the next 7 vs 300 mission?)

465
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,620
(They're tensed up.)

466
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,790
(300th Episode Special: 7 vs 300m)

467
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,210
The second mission...

468
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,310
(300m?)

469
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,450
- Metres?
 -  It's 300m.

470
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,810
- What's this about?
 -  What's this?

471
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,000
The second mission is "300m Essay".

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,130
- What?
 -  An essay?

473
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,410
(Do they have to write a 300m-long essay?)

474
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,560
Please look behind you.

475
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,090
- I'm good at writing.
 -  You'll see manuscript paper.

476
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,420
The total length of this paper is 300m.

477
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,180
Each box is 10cm long...

478
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,680
and it fills 3,000 letters in total.

479
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,180
(Each box is 10cm, and they must fill in 3,000 letters!)

480
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,360
Each member...

481
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,650
should write at least 430 characters.

482
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,750
- Really?
 -  430?

483
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,850
- Do you want us to write a book?
 -  430?

484
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,050
(It's like writing a novel.)

485
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,480
You'll divide yourselves...

486
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,390
into two groups and start on both ends.

487
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,010
The theme of "300m Essay"...

488
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,420
is the 300th episode.

489
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,680
You must fill up the paper in 30 minutes.

490
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,310
If you cannot finish on time,

491
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,360
flour-filled balloons will pop on top of your heads,

492
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,760
so please try to finish on time.

493
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,150
(3,000 characters...)

494
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,710
(in 30 minutes?)

495
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,710
Jae Seok, you have to get it this time.

496
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,150
Why would I not get it?

497
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,180
- Give him a good spot.
 -  We have to watch Jae Seok.

498
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,660
That's enough.

499
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,280
(Will they succeed?)

500
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,680
Once we meet in the middle, it has to flow well.

501
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,690
It's too long.

502
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,450
- Jong Kook, just write whatever.
 -  Right.

503
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,650
It's freestyle writing.

504
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,820
Ji Hyo, write a lot.

505
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,580
What should I write about?

506
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,780
Ji Hyo, just keep going.

507
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,010
It's freestyle writing, anyway.

508
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,180
It has to be on topic.

509
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
- I know.
 -  Of course.

510
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,520
Get the timer ready.

511
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,210
Let's get ready. Timer.

512
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,350
(They have balloons attached to their heads.)

513
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,760
Start the timer.

514
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,030
- Yes, let's go.
 -  Start!

515
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,210
(It has begun!)

516
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,720
- Yes, let's go.
 -  Let's go!

517
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,010
(They only have 30 minutes.)

518
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,710
Ji Hyo, you're slow.

519
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,260
(Wow, this...)

520
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
(What will become of them?)

521
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
Write whatever.

522
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,660
Good job.

523
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,090
- Yes, let's go.
 -  Let's go!

524
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,630
Write whatever.

525
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,140
Good job.

526
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,990
Keep going. It's smooth.

527
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,020
Good job.

528
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
- Good job. Write all of our names.
 -  This is good.

529
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,310
That's right. Good one, Ji Hyo.

530
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,200
- You're smart!
 -  Good one.

531
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,780
Hold on. Haha and Gary...

532
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,280
Write Kang Hee Geon. Fill up another space.

533
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,310
Write Gary.

534
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,070
- Write Kang Hee Geon.
 -  This is difficult, Ji Hyo.

535
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,320
You came far.

536
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,980
- This is so hard.
 -  You still have a long way.

537
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,520
We have to fill up a row each.

538
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,750
"We run and run again."

539
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,940
That flows well.

540
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,080
It's pretty good.

541
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,750
- "We run and run again."
 -  Well done, Ji Hyo.

542
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,310
Ji Hyo, I didn't know you were good in writing.

543
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,560
- I'm not.
 -  That was unexpected.

544
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,920
(Ji Hyo is the best in writing, too.)

545
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,880
(It's literary, yet strategic.)

546
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,060
Ji Hyo, that's good!

547
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,170
I like those zeros.

548
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,950
That's 1, 10th, 100th, 1,000th, 10,000th, 100,000th, 100,000th,

549
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,480
a million, 10 million, 100 million,

550
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,610
one billion and...

551
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,750
- 300 billion.
 -  You should have been a writer.

552
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,050
- Jae Seok.
 -  "In my next life,"

553
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,630
In my next life...

554
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,850
You came far.

555
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,860
(She'll be on Running Man in her next life, too.)

556
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,720
Jong Kook, why are you still there?

557
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,180
You're so slow.

558
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,310
Jong Kook is writing an emotional essay!

559
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,720
(He's writing an emotional essay!)

560
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,020
- How sentimental.
 -  He's starting his literary career!

561
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,250
(Every day passes by like a flash.)

562
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,350
- "The past days..."
 -  "The past days..."

563
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,780
(We shared so many good and bad times. The seven of us...)

564
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,380
This is heartwarming.

565
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,650
(Used to be awkward but overcame it to be here today. We wouldn't be...)

566
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,820
"Every day..."

567
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,620
- "passes by like a flash."
 -  That's right.

568
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,930
Hey, hurry up!

569
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,790
Jong Kook, you're being too sincere.

570
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,710
Hey, write all of our names.

571
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,520
Write my name. You have to make it longer.

572
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,320
Write each of our names.

573
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,850
- This is too long.
 -  We took care of each other...

574
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,330
This might pop.

575
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,110
We're doomed if you take a break!

576
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,050
Hurry up!

577
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,190
You're almost there.

578
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,560
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo is almost done!

579
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
What language is this?

580
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,380
It's illegible near the end.

581
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,150
I can't even understand.

582
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,490
(Scribbling)

583
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,650
- What's that?
 -  "Geu".

584
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,050
(Ji Hyo fills up 300 characters.)

585
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,150
- "Geu"?
 -  "Geu".

586
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,390
And...

587
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,590
- Good job.
 -  everybody,

588
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,160
- Wow.
 -  "With utmost sincerity..."

589
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,490
Hello.

590
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,480
"Everybody, hello?" You're supposed to add "With utmost sincerity".

591
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm being sincere.

592
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,590
I have to introduce myself.

593
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,490
There needs to be a space here!

594
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,660
Every space counts!

595
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,610
Make up words.

596
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,850
- Don't just say hello.
 -  Skip a space.

597
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,510
"With all my heart..."

598
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,180
"Wholeheartedly..."

599
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,820
Gosh! What do you think you're doing?

600
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,990
Why are you picking on me?

601
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,090
- It's obvious you're a spy.
 -  Hurry up!

602
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,590
You're driving me nuts.

603
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,610
- Write giggling signs.
 -  Jong Kook, hurry up!

604
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,080
You need to skip a space!

605
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,450
I usually don't skip spaces.

606
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,020
You can't do that.

607
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,650
There are spaces in Korean.

608
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,950
Hurry up. Hurry.

609
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,280
- Okay.
 -  Hey.

610
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,620
You need spaces!

611
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,880
(Ji Hyo explodes.)

612
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
(This must be forced labour.)

613
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,290
Skip a space! Why aren't you?

614
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,390
Draw a smiley face.

615
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,350
And then?

616
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,610
It's already been...

617
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,480
- "Already..."
 -  300 episodes.

618
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,490
- "This day has..."
 -  "This day?"

619
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,900
"finally come."

620
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,110
"This day has finally come."

621
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,850
- Smiley face!
 -  "Is this reality?"

622
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,980
- Smiley face.
 -  "If not,"

623
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,910
"am I dreaming?"

624
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,690
"Am I mistaken?"

625
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,390
"What do you think, everybody?"

626
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,650
"I didn't know 300 episodes..."

627
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,810
"What do you think, everybody?"

628
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,310
(Gosh)

629
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,390
- Skip spaces!
 -  Please, stop!

630
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,750
Write something along the line!

631
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,320
Skip spaces.

632
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,010
- You have to, Kwang Soo.
 -  Hurry up!

633
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,180
- Write like you're typing.
 -  Why are you doing this?

634
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,260
Hurry up!

635
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,380
This is too painful.

636
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,850
(Kwang Soo will suffer for life.)

637
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,190
This is difficult.

638
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,860
- He's finished now, Jae Seok.
 -  All right.

639
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,750
(No more agony, please!)

640
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,760
How...

641
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,520
- "Can I express it in words?"
 -  can I say it...

642
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,820
(Kwang Soo is being polite until the end.)

643
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,690
For you to feel my sense of gratitude?

644
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
I...

645
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,910
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok are still watching him.)

646
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,050
Will live life to the fullest.

647
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,260
(He's a slave of 300 years.)

648
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,180
Until the 400th episode,

649
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
(The abuse...)

650
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,650
500th episode,

651
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,810
(Ends here.)

652
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,450
- 500th episode.
 -  "500th episode".

653
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,550
(It's Jae Seok's turn. What will we write?)

654
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,860
600th episode,

655
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,920
700th episode,

656
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,660
- 800th episode,
 -  Good job, Jae Seok.

657
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,880
We'll let you write until the 1,000th episode.

658
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,280
- 900th episode,
 -  Jae Seok.

659
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,780
Write 901st episode.

660
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,280
Are you disregarding the 901st episode?

661
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,090
901st episode,

662
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,490
902nd episode,

663
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,180
We'll let you write until 905th episode.

664
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,420
903rd episode,

665
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,350
- 904th episode,
 -  "904th episode".

666
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,590
(He'll be on Running Man in his next life, too.)

667
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,960
905th episode...

668
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,420
and...

669
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,980
(And)

670
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,020
Finally,

671
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,150
the anticipated...

672
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,910
(And the anticipated...)

673
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,050
1,000th...

674
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,210
(And the anticipated 1,000th episode.)

675
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,380
- Episode.
 -  Jae Seok, how can you stop there?

676
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,080
Until then, we'll work our fingers to the bone...

677
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,190
- What?
 -  "To the bone"?

678
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
And we'll not...

679
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,910
spare ourselves.

680
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,510
We're not even halfway done.

681
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,920
I, Yu Jae Seok,

682
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,410
- Jae Seok,
 -  Rush yourself.

683
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,910
Give him some water!

684
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,030
- This is not easy.
 -  Seok Jin...

685
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,720
Jae Seok, mention Hwan Jin.

686
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,450
- Why?
 -  Lee Hwan Jin,

687
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,080
(We need something different.)

688
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
Producer Yong Woo...

689
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,880
- Cheol Min.
 -  Cheol Min.

690
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,850
and Cheol Min.

691
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,150
- Writer Lee Hee Yeon...
 -  "Writer".

692
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,210
(He takes care of each staff member.)

693
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,620
Writer...

694
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,320
Director Kang Chang Hee,

695
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,510
Park Seong Bae, Jeon Seong Ho,

696
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:08,210
Director Kang Yong Yoo.

697
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,390
And Cameraman Kwon Ryeol,

698
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,950
Gi Jin, Yoon Sang,

699
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,480
- Can we have your names?
 -  Give me your names.

700
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,980
- Tell me your names.
 -  We need names from the audio team.

701
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,120
- Give me your names.
 -  Tell us your names.

702
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
Director Nam Hyun Geun,

703
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,210
Director Kim Won Chip.

704
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,750
- Kim...
 -  "Won Chip".

705
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,640
- Director...
 -  What's your name, Director?

706
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,880
And Chae Jae Won...

707
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
You went from "I, Yu Jae Seok" to all the way here.

708
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,510
All right. I promise you this.

709
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,150
- I...
 -  There are 10 minutes left.

710
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,460
thank you...

711
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,250
- sincerely.
 -  You're almost there.

712
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,390
I don't know how to thank you.

713
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,490
- Are you sure about the spelling?
 -  Yes.

714
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,110
- Heart.
 -  We did it.

715
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,410
- We did it!
 -  Jae Seok.

716
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,560
- We finished.
 -  We finished it!

717
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,370
Gosh, I am so thirsty.

718
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,330
We're done. We finished.

719
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,180
- When?
 -  We are almost there.

720
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,890
- Put a question mark.
 -  For the 79th episode,

721
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,050
- it was the Sherlock Homes special.
 -  Good, Sherlock.

722
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,380
- I'm...
 -  I was so upset.

723
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,080
(Is he doing a mission or ventilating his anger?)

724
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,490
I just had to take down Jong Kook and...

725
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,410
- His explanation is very detailed.
 -  Ji Hyo.

726
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,410
- He must've been very upset.
 -  For the 79th episode.

727
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,480
- He has a lot of anger.
 -  Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

728
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,550
(300th Episode Special, I can finally say it.)

729
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,020
You're so inhumane.

730
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,420
I was trying hard...

731
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,310
- to make things work and win.
 -  There you go.

732
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,960
- Just a little bit more.
 -  I...

733
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
- want to...
 -  We are almost done.

734
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,710
- be in the centre.
 -  We have to wrap it up.

735
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,250
- In 1, 2...
 -  And happy new year.

736
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,280
- Go, Running Man.
 -  End it with 7012.

737
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,410
7012.

738
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,810
(Like we've done for 300 episodes, let's continue on together forever!)

739
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,490
- There you go.
 -  You're done, right? We're done!

740
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,920
(Seok Jin succeeds as well!)

741
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,180
- The second mission ended.
 -  We succeeded.

742
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,050
For the "300m Essay",

743
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,880
(The second mission was "300m Essay".)

744
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,620
Running Man has succeeded.

745
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,160
- We had a lot to say.
 -  This is just the beginning.

746
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,360
In just 23 minutes,

747
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,760
- you wrote a 300m long essay.
 -  You're right.

748
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,350
- We didn't just write things.
 -  There is a story to it.

749
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,580
Ji Hyo was clever enough to use longer terms for everything.

750
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,350
- We won using such methods.
 -  Of course.

751
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,950
- Take the puzzle pieces.
 -  Right now...

752
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,760
They will provide the most important hints for the final mission.

753
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,680
(What is the purpose of these puzzle pieces?)

754
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,050
They will provide the most important hints for the final mission.

755
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,310
It must be a map.

756
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,780
What's this?

757
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,490
(They must gather all the pieces to escape from the dark!)

758
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,190
- I saw it.
 -  It works.

759
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,310
(Running Man's 300th Episode Celebratory Dinner)

760
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,660
This is amazing.

761
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,750
Seok Jin, you did a good job for the past 300 episodes.

762
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,920
- Why are you saying that?
 -  You're here on the 300th episode.

763
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,260
You wanted to quit in the middle.

764
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,750
Yes, that's right. I only said it to the producer, but...

765
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,350
apparently he talked about it with the entire world.

766
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,420
- Was it around episode 42?
 -  It was earlier than that.

767
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,250
- It was around episode 30.
 -  What are you talking about?

768
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,380
It was around episode 20 something.

769
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,780
I called Jae Seok every day and told him that I wanted to quit.

770
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,650
- Seok Jin, really...
 -  He drank and cried a lot then.

771
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,850
I used to do that.

772
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,760
I tried so hard to stop him.

773
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,880
Gosh, I regret it.

774
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,090
- Gosh.
 -  We did so much for him.

775
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,180
In celebration of the 300th episode,

776
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,950
- we prepared a feast.
 -  They must cherish us.

777
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,570
The third mission is...

778
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,380
(It's time for the third mission.)

779
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,620
It's 7 versus 300...

780
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,110
bowls.

781
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,350
(300th Episode Special: "300 Bowls")

782
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,180
"300 Bowls".

783
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,940
- What?
 -  Bowls.

784
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,760
The Running Man members who have been running for 300 episodes...

785
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,850
- will compete against seven...
 -  The cameramen?

786
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,460
- The cameramen?
 -  cameramen who always assist you.

787
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,610
On the table,

788
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,790
- there are 300 different dishes.
 -  We can't finish that.

789
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,310
- We're at a disadvantage.
 -  We lost.

790
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,950
- You will eat as much as you can.
 -  You have to be considerate.

791
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,810
When you can't eat any more, the next person will take over.

792
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,380
- We have to eat as much as we can.
 -  Is that right?

793
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,110
- Jong Kook doesn't eat anything.
 -  He's such a picky eater.

794
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,480
I can eat a lot, but the kind of food is the problem.

795
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,280
- Cameramen, please come on out.
 -  I can eat a lot.

796
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,160
Look at them. Look how big they are.

797
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,380
Are they really the cameramen?

798
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,900
- They eat so well.
 -  Actually,

799
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,780
the cameramen have been...

800
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,310
- working with us for 300 episodes.
 -  That's right.

801
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,650
Right. The ones here...

802
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,910
- They've been here from the start.
 -  Most of them have.

803
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,750
They've been working hard with us.

804
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,880
They sometimes make us get busted.

805
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,690
Thanks to Kwon Ryeol, I always found you.

806
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,710
(All about Running Man's cameramen)

807
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,990
I know.

808
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,750
(For the Running Man cameramen, filming is the basic of the basics.)

809
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,990
(They experience horror and fall down with the members.)

810
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,780
(They are cameramen, but they are required to play games well, too.)

811
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,450
(Or else, they'll be scolded by the members.)

812
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,510
(It's very tough to be a cameraman for Running Man.)

813
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,810
- I know.
 -  You're right.

814
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,350
Since it's the 300th episode,

815
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,250
let's hear how they feel.

816
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,380
Can you honestly tell us what you don't like about me?

817
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,420
- Anything?
 -  I don't have anything.

818
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,150
- It's okay to be honest.
 -  It's okay.

819
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,580
- It's okay. Say it.
 -  Be honest.

820
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,320
He still complains about what I said about him last time.

821
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,550
- He always bears a grudge.
 -  He bears a grudge.

822
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,610
He always bears a grudge.

823
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,750
I deserve to get kicked.

824
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,380
You should kick me once.

825
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,450
- Treat him nicely.
 -  Gosh.

826
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,350
- Anything you want to say?
 -  This is a dream job for him.

827
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,210
- Please be honest.
 -  He went home early at the start.

828
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,950
- Tell us your honest opinion.
 -  Many people are mistaken.

829
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,780
- About what?
 -  That my work is easy.

830
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,900
But actually, he's the one who won second place most frequently.

831
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,120
He lasts until the end for no good reason.

832
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,560
(He lasts long for no good reason.)

833
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,580
- He can't win.
 -  And his parts don't get aired.

834
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,660
And he's not funny.

835
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,060
His parts don't get aired, and he's not funny.

836
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,080
- He works hard to film you.
 -  But it's all meaningless.

837
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,400
His work doesn't get used.

838
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,070
I understand.

839
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,580
Anyway, they eat really well.

840
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,980
Like I said, you currently have zero money.

841
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,210
It's because we failed the "3,000 Dollars" mission.

842
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,720
- It's frustrating.
 -  So if Team Running Man loses,

843
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,050
- I prepared a card machine.
 -  What?

844
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,310
If your team loses, one of you will swipe your credit card.

845
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,050
How much is the total?

846
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,920
- One person will pay for it.
 -  We're paying for this food.

847
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,450
Ready!

848
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,280
(They get ready for the game.)

849
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,550
(The team that eats more food within the given time wins.)

850
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,590
Ready and go.

851
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,150
- I...
 -  He loves jelly.

852
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,010
- He loves that.
 -  Haha really loves that.

853
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,490
- Mix it all and eat it.
 -  Hurry up.

854
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,390
You can eat as much as you can.

855
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,180
He's very serious.

856
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,810
Why are you so relaxed?

857
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,080
Just put it in your mouth first.

858
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,310
- Just swallow it.
 -  I think you should...

859
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,880
- go to the next dish while chewing.
 -  Yoo Seok is good.

860
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,780
How can he be so relaxed?

861
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,720
Yoo Seok is very relaxed.

862
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,280
(This place has good food.)

863
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,350
- He's a true foodie.
 -  He eats so well.

864
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,920
People like him last long.

865
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,060
- Come on.
 -  Hey.

866
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,680
Be careful with those marshmallows.

867
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,380
Haha loves marshmallows.

868
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,050
(Marshmallows take long to swallow.)

869
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,380
It takes long to chew those.

870
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,460
(But Haha doesn't hesitate to eat them.)

871
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,580
You're winning right now.

872
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,350
How would it taste to eat cucumber kimchi with candy?

873
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,710
- It must be terrible.
 -  Why did they arrange it that way?

874
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,260
- That's a macaron.
 -  He eats so well.

875
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,570
- You can do well, too.
 -  He finished 20 dishes.

876
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,690
(Yoo Seok finishes with the cucumber kimchi.)

877
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,550
(Haha's cameraman, Seong Yong, goes next.)

878
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,120
What is he doing?

879
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,450
Yoo Seok is already out.

880
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,450
- He's eating the candy.
 -  They are very slow.

881
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,020
We shouldn't eat too much in the beginning.

882
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,950
- Pass it to the next person.
 -  Right.

883
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,570
Your turn will come back.

884
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,520
- You should eat what you can.
 -  Let's change.

885
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,320
- Eat what you can eat.
 -  Kwang Soo. That's right.

886
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,110
Kwang Soo eats well.

887
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,150
- We might win. We never know.
 -  We are winning.

888
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,660
- They eat a lot, but they're slow.
 -  Why are they so slow?

889
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,380
- What's this?
 -  It's garlic.

890
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,660
It's a grape. No, it's a raw garlic clove.

891
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,350
Just swallow it.

892
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,190
- Just swallow it.
 -  Don't. It will smell all day.

893
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,780
- Eat it.
 -  Just chew it. That's better.

894
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,580
(Garlic sterilises and has an anti-bacterial effect.)

895
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,980
Gosh, you can smell it.

896
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,150
Kwang Soo usually stores food in his cheeks like a squirrel.

897
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,060
- It's all right.
 -  Nice. His cheeks are fat.

898
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
He's unbelievable.

899
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,020
If you can't eat, switch.

900
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,580
- Switch.
 -  This is salted fish.

901
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,490
Do you have to eat all of this?

902
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,750
- Pass it to him.
 -  Do I need to eat flour?

903
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,210
- Do I need to eat flour?
 -  You have to eat it!

904
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,850
- You have to eat that!
 -  You can't not eat it!

905
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,490
What are you talking about?

906
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,350
What are you doing?

907
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,080
(Seong Yong is out and Ji Hyo's cameraman, Si Yeon, enters.)

908
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,550
Swallow it. Nice.

909
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,530
- How many did you finish?
 -  Just shove it in your mouth.

910
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,060
- Come on.
 -  Hurry up.

911
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,020
- That's it.
 -  Good job.

912
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,580
They caught up.

913
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,560
Seok Jin, they caught up with us!

914
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,250
- Hurry up!
 -  Just shove it in your mouth!

915
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,560
Flip the plates!

916
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,710
If you can't eat, switch.

917
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,780
(There's still a long way to go.)

918
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,020
We are only two plates faster.

919
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,760
Just put it in your mouth. Focus.

920
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,710
- Gosh.
 -  You didn't even eat so much!

921
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,090
- What is this?
 -  It was enough.

922
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,150
- Gosh, Jong Kook is amazing.
 -  Go, Jong Kook!

923
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,880
It's been such a long time since Jong Kook has...

924
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,250
- eaten food like that.
 -  It's been a long time.

925
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,360
I can't believe it.

926
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,450
They put so much butter in this.

927
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,460
Just eat it. Gosh.

928
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,920
My goodness!

929
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,350
Do you know how many of those we eat every day?

930
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,280
Jong Kook, are you doing that chewing-for-30-seconds thing?

931
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,850
(Jong Kook is chewing for 30 seconds.)

932
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,980
Are you eating for your health right now?

933
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,020
- Are you?
 -  He takes 30 seconds to chew.

934
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,860
Next is Ji Hyo.

935
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,100
- Flip the plate.
 -  She's not a big eater.

936
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,420
- But she's eating very well.
 -  Good job.

937
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,680
- That's it.
 -  Mix them together...

938
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,250
- like bibimbap.
 -  That looks delicious.

939
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,620
- That's like bibimbap.
 -  You should enjoy it.

940
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,610
- Bravo.
 -  Good job.

941
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,790
You should eat two plates at a time.

942
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,110
(He doesn't even bother using chopsticks.)

943
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,410
- It's like you're eating sushi.
 -  Hey!

944
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,480
- Look at him.
 -  He's crazy.

945
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,780
He's unbelievable.

946
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,990
He combines several plates and eats it in one bite.

947
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,110
- Gosh, what's up with him?
 -  We have to focus!

948
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,210
- Look at him.
 -  Is it my turn already?

949
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,950
They caught up.

950
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,560
- They did.
 -  It's curry rice.

951
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,990
Good. You have to add water.

952
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,810
- I can't put water in it.
 -  Eat it.

953
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,880
(Jae Seok chases them fiercely.)

954
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,540
There's ginger, too.

955
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,880
There's ginger and onion.

956
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,110
(Ginger and onion await Jae Seok.)

957
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,690
Eat the onion with bread.

958
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,580
That's going to be delicious. There's sauce, too.

959
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,790
Hey.

960
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,880
(Finally, they are halfway done.)

961
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,780
- Go!
 -  Hurry up.

962
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,550
- Who's next?
 -  I had kimchi.

963
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,910
(Everyone is reaching their limit.)

964
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,120
Just put it in your mouth and swallow it.

965
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,880
Stuff the bread in.

966
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,620
You must hurry. They are on their 160th plate.

967
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,320
Seok Jin, hurry up and eat that muffin.

968
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,180
Just put it in your mouth.

969
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,450
It's not an ordinary muffin. It's a chocolate muffin.

970
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,650
- Look.
 -  Eat that muffin.

971
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,710
Are you crazy?

972
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,080
- Hurry up!
 -  Eat that muffin!

973
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,340
- Just put it in your mouth.
 -  Quickly!

974
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,110
I have two chocolates to eat!

975
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,190
Hurry.

976
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,130
(Delicious)

977
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,280
- Hurry up, Seok Jin.
 -  Quick.

978
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,260
- He's done.
 -  All right. He's finished.

979
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,150
My goodness.

980
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,910
(Jong Kook really hates chocolate.)

981
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,150
Hurry up. Eat it.

982
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,460
What am I eating?

983
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,030
Hurry. Kwon Ryeol is eating so fast.

984
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,910
(Finally, the man has arrived.)

985
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,010
(Cameraman Kwon Ryeol devours food like a black hole.)

986
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,160
We have a time limit.

987
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,450
Swap after you put food in your mouth. You can swallow it later.

988
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,540
Hurry up, Seok Jin! You must eat faster!

989
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,610
Seok Jin!

990
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,320
- Hurry up and eat!
 -  Just switch.

991
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,520
- Seok Jin, it's your turn.
 -  I can't eat any more.

992
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,810
Let's swap. Quick.

993
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,050
Let's swap, Seok Jin.

994
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,220
My goodness.

995
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,520
What is this? More. Eat more.

996
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,210
(7 Running Man members vs Cameraman Kwon Ryeol)

997
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,060
- Go on, go on.
 -  Go, go, go.

998
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,810
Just put it in your mouth. Put it in.

999
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,450
(206 plates for Team Cameramen, 203 plates for Team Running Man)

1000
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,450
- You're next, Seok Jin.
 -  We're on the 207th dish.

1001
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,110
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo. Eat quickly.

1002
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,110
Swap quickly. Hurry.

1003
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,650
(They are close to the time limit.)

1004
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,080
- Hurry up.
 -  I can't eat more.

1005
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,610
- Didn't you swallow the muffin yet?
 -  Is that it?

1006
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,680
Wait.

1007
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,720
What's the number?

1008
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,880
221.

1009
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
(Team Running Man finished 221 plates.)

1010
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,340
(What about Team Cameramen?)

1011
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,460
(In order to win, Team Cameramen should eat at least 222 bowls.)

1012
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,580
226.

1013
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,340
(They finished 226 plates.)

1014
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,410
My gosh.

1015
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,250
(Team Cameramen wins.)

1016
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,390
It was tough.

1017
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,030
Is it over?

1018
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,670
They tried so hard.

1019
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,720
Oh, man.

1020
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,350
Please come over here. Will you?

1021
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,520
What should we do now?

1022
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,380
- Who's paying?
 -  If we spared 1,500 dollars before,

1023
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,880
we could've paid it all easily.

1024
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
- You're right.
 -  I'm not joking...

1025
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,650
- You're so weird. Don't you agree?
 -  Why?

1026
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,520
- You did so badly before.
 -  If you spared 1,500 dollars...

1027
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,250
If you spared 1,500 dollars, then we'd be able to pay for this.

1028
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,610
It's 1,140 dollars in total.

1029
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,850
- No way.
 -  Are you serious?

1030
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,760
- What are you talking about?
 -  That's too expensive.

1031
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,650
Jong Kook really hates paying through the nose.

1032
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,950
He has been like this for several years.

1033
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,550
Jong Kook never pays through the nose.

1034
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,210
I really don't.

1035
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,740
- You can choose one person to pay.
 -  To pay 1,140 dollars?

1036
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,710
Yes. Here's the invoice.

1037
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,850
- Then...
 -  Only one person?

1038
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,180
- Should we roll the dice?
 -  How about this?

1039
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,190
Let's write the amount to pay...

1040
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,010
- on seven pieces of paper.
 -  For each person?

1041
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,810
- I see.
 -  It must be fun.

1042
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,980
That sounds good.

1043
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,550
- Like, "Pay zero dollars?"
 -  Yes, exactly.

1044
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,880
I'll first write 1,000 dollars.

1045
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,260
- Okay.
 -  That's good.

1046
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,210
- 100 dollars for the second one.
 -  100 dollars sounds good.

1047
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,290
30 dollars.

1048
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,180
Let's make the next one seven dollars. It'll be annoying.

1049
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,920
- You have to pay for what you get.
 -  I will pay up to seven dollars.

1050
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,810
- I'll pay up to 30 dollars.
 -  Write "Dance" on one of them.

1051
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,850
- The person who gets this...
 -  You'll dance in joy if you get it.

1052
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,110
- must dance.
 -  Dancing time.

1053
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,160
(Should I pay or just dance?)

1054
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,710
(I can dance many times if I don't have to pay.)

1055
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,350
Please! I want to dance!

1056
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,880
- He's practising.
 -  Let's make some room.

1057
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,410
- Please step back a bit.
 -  My note is folded so finely.

1058
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,680
This means it's one of the first to be folded.

1059
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,780
- Mine is folded tightly, too.
 -  Why don't you open it first, Haha?

1060
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,080
1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars.

1061
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,650
(Haha reveals his note, first.)

1062
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,520
- 1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1063
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,780
(How much will Haha pay?)

1064
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,540
- It's 30 dollars.
 -  30 dollars? It's okay.

1065
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,060
Yes. I like it.

1066
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,680
- 30 dollars sounds all right.
 -  30 dollars.

1067
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,650
30 dollars? Thank you so much.

1068
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,280
30 dollars. Thank you.

1069
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,780
- It's Gary's turn.
 -  I hope it's 1,000 dollars.

1070
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,750
- 1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars.
 -  I think I'll pay 1,000 dollars.

1071
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,460
- 1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars.
 -  Okay, Gary. In 1, 2, 3.

1072
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,850
- It's three dollars.
 -  Oh my goodness.

1073
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,950
Three!

1074
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,020
- It's three dollars.
 -  Oh my goodness.

1075
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,220
I don't need to dance.

1076
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,090
You're so lucky to pay only three dollars.

1077
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,680
It's your turn, Ji Hyo.

1078
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,310
Please play the music with no haste if the note shows dance.

1079
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,650
- One,
 -  1,000 dollars.

1080
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,760
- two...
 -  You can pay this time, Ji Hyo.

1081
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,790
(Ji Hyo is one of the luckiest members. How much will she pay?)

1082
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,030
(Dance)

1083
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,840
(Dancing in joy)

1084
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,210
(Same dance for the past 300 episodes)

1085
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,350
It means...

1086
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,920
- These four people.
 -  two won't pay any and...

1087
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,950
one person will pay 1,000 dollars and another will pay 100 dollars.

1088
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,450
We are really lucky.

1089
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,550
- You are really lucky.
 -  They really are.

1090
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,560
- You guys are so unlucky.
 -  Gosh.

1091
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,680
We have three unlucky people on this side.

1092
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,280
- Anyway...
 -  How can it turn out like this?

1093
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,620
- It's driving me mad.
 -  Anyway,

1094
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,880
- Jong Kook is rather lucky.
 -  Will you open up first?

1095
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,110
Please open it first.

1096
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,280
- I have a bad feeling about this.
 -  1,000 dollars.

1097
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,520
- We have unlucky Kwang Soo, too.
 -  If he has to pay 1,000 dollars,

1098
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,550
- it will be amazing.
 -  I may be the unlucky one today.

1099
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,050
- Go, Jong Kook.
 -  Please.

1100
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,110
I wish you'd pay 1,000 dollars, Jong Kook.

1101
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,850
He's unlucky for these kind of games.

1102
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,150
- Jong Kook, pay 1,000 dollars.
 -  Please.

1103
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,590
Here's 1,000 dollars.

1104
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,020
(Not this time,)

1105
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,690
(please.)

1106
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,310
- Here.
 -  1,000 dollars.

1107
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,180
(Jong Kook will pay 1,000 dollars.)

1108
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,450
(Jackpot!)

1109
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,590
(Jong Kook will pay 1,000 dollars.)

1110
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,350
Poor Jong Kook.

1111
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,680
(It's okay, as long as it's not me.)

1112
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,690
Jong Kook.

1113
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,850
(Jong Kook is the new unluckiest person in the group.)

1114
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,720
- Poor Jong Kook.
 -  How can this be?

1115
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,110
(Why did luck turn its back on me?)

1116
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,150
He even ate all the food that he doesn't normally eat.

1117
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,530
- Jong Kook.
 -  The big guy of the party.

1118
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,560
He finally...

1119
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,310
- got a new nickname in six years.
 -  When I...

1120
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,550
- picked it up, I had a bad feeling.
 -  Gosh.

1121
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,020
- Jong Kook.
 -  Jong Kook pays big for the party.

1122
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,910
Jong Kook always pays big amounts.

1123
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,250
(He had to pay for a big staff party last year.)

1124
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,280
- Jong Kook is so generous.
 -  Jong Kook is the big guy.

1125
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,520
- All right. It's the three of us.
 -  I can open it happily now.

1126
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,150
- 100 dollars is not small.
 -  One of us have to pay 100 dollars.

1127
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,350
- 100 dollars is not a small amount.
 -  It's not small.

1128
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,750
In 1, 2, 3.

1129
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,080
Kwang Soo first.

1130
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,460
What's your guess?

1131
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,290
You can exchange your notes.

1132
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,180
- You can.
 -  I want to change.

1133
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,650
Fold it again, first.

1134
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,880
- Okay.
 -  Exchange your notes.

1135
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,610
- Okay, I will.
 -  Do you think I should?

1136
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,680
- I read it on your face.
 -  Okay.

1137
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,640
- Let's exchange.
 -  I read his facial expression.

1138
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,380
- One...
 -  Swap again.

1139
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,020
Open them up first before you swap your notes. Let us see.

1140
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,590
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1141
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,310
- Goodness. Wait.
 -  Let's swap again.

1142
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,050
Exchange your notes. This is your last chance.

1143
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,380
- Okay.
 -  This is the last time.

1144
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,110
(They are all happy and swapping notes again.)

1145
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,450
- All right.
 -  Let's go.

1146
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,050
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1147
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,160
(How much will they pay in the end?)

1148
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,780
(Kwang Soo will pay 100 dollars, and Seok Jin will pay 7 dollars.)

1149
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,860
Look at your notes.

1150
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,660
Yes!

1151
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,980
- Kwang Soo got 100 dollars.
 -  I only have to pay 7 dollars.

1152
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,550
This wasn't even what I had at first.

1153
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,350
- Who was holding that memo first?
 -  Look. I'm free.

1154
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,550
- Was I?
 -  I got zero dollars.

1155
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,610
Congratulations, Jong Kook.

1156
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,520
100 dollars is not cheap, but he has to pay 1,000 dollars.

1157
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,090
You're amazing, Jong Kook.

1158
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,450
He's the big guy.

1159
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,460
(Thank you, Jong Kook.)

1160
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,490
It's so hard to win.

1161
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,610
It's impossible to win against the cameramen.

1162
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,990
- It was sweet, salty and spicy.
 -  By the way,

1163
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,400
it was so nice to see Jong Kook eating cheese.

1164
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,260
I've never seen him eating cheese before.

1165
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,110
I don't eat cheese that often because of the fat.

1166
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,450
- I've never seen it before.
 -  It was my first time.

1167
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,150
Why did I have to eat so many chocolates?

1168
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,680
Doesn't it feel great to see Jong Kook paying 1,000 dollars?

1169
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,510
I feel so relieved because there are many unlucky people here.

1170
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,110
- Jong Kook always pay big.
 -  The big ones.

1171
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,250
- Large-scale.
 -  The expensive ones.

1172
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,240
He usually ends up paying around 1,000 dollars or more.

1173
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,810
- Jong Kook, you're just a big guy.
 -  A big guy.

1174
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,980
You're a big guy, and...

1175
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,720
- He usually gets small penalties.
 -  You're right.

1176
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,030
Do you remember this place?

1177
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,360
We crossed that river.

1178
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,800
- Yes, I do.
 -  You're right.

1179
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,620
We have so many memories everywhere in Seoul.

1180
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,150
We were there with university students on a cold, winter day.

1181
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,610
I never thought that I'd ever go into that river in my lifetime.

1182
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,260
- I never imagined it before.
 -  But we all went into the river.

1183
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,050
- In the middle of winter.
 -  Back then,

1184
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,750
I couldn't stop laughing.

1185
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,680
- I kept laughing.
 -  It was really difficult.

1186
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,480
- I fell into the river.
 -  It was so cold.

1187
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,550
You could tell it was cold from everyone's facial expressions.

1188
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,290
Are there 300 boxes out there?

1189
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,490
(What are those boxes out there?)

1190
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,060
Why so many?

1191
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,460
- Gosh.
 -  This is amazing.

1192
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,500
- What is that?
 -  What is that for?

1193
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,350
Didn't we once play Jenga with boxes and ruin everything?

1194
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,360
We did. Ji Hyo climbed up at the time.

1195
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,850
- What are these?
 -  What's going on?

1196
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,150
(There are boxes everywhere. What is this mission about?)

1197
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,190
There are so many boxes.

1198
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,000
This is your fourth mission.

1199
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,190
Gary, can you please push that question mark over there?

1200
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,450
- Go, Gary.
 -  Gary.

1201
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,550
(Anticipating)

1202
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,690
- 7 versus...
 -  It must be 300 boxes.

1203
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,120
- Boxes.
 -  "300 Boxes".

1204
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,240
"300 Boxes"?

1205
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
What is that about?

1206
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,710
We have special guests for this mission.

1207
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,970
Really?

1208
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,420
- There's a car.
 -  Do we have guests?

1209
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,560
I think they'll be bodyguards.

1210
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,210
Judging from that car...

1211
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,680
- Idol group members?
 -  Maybe they are bodyguards.

1212
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,780
They must be idol group members.

1213
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,160
- TWICE?
 -  TWICE sounds nice.

1214
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,050
I think they're bodyguards.

1215
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,790
- They're men.
 -  Maybe I.O.I?

1216
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,510
(The car looks out of the ordinary. Please show us who you are.)

1217
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,390
- They're guys.
 -  They are not female idols.

1218
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,820
- Who is it?
 -  They're coming out.

1219
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,860
(They are watching with great expectation.)

1220
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,550
(BTS is here for Running Man's 300th special mission.)

1221
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,810
They're BTS.

1222
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,290
- Look, that's Jimin.
 -  Are they BTS?

1223
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,450
- Yes, they are BTS.
 -  Welcome, BTS.

1224
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,770
Nice to see you!

1225
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,120
- Yes.
 -  It's so unexpected.

1226
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,880
(A talented and popular idol group with many fans.)

1227
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,860
(All the members of BTS have come to Running Man.)

1228
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,220
I didn't know that BTS would be here today.

1229
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,560
(They begin with a powerful dance.)

1230
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,110
(They are warming up with their dance.)

1231
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,980
- Their dance is so powerful.
 -  Go harder.

1232
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,090
(Are you ready to play?)

1233
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,760
Dance harder, will you?

1234
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,010
(This is how young idols dance together in a group.)

1235
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,350
- They are dancing exactly the same.
 -  That's amazing.

1236
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,710
(It's a powerful dance.)

1237
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,330
(Wriggling)

1238
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,050
- They are great.
 -  You can't not like them.

1239
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,090
Wow, BTS.

1240
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,110
(That was marvellous.)

1241
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,650
You're on fire.

1242
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,660
- How can I not like you?
 -  You're so good.

1243
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,610
- You guys are great.
 -  I really loved...

1244
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,160
when Rap Monster acted...

1245
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,780
like this in the end.

1246
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,330
That's it. It looks so nice.

1247
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,440
I should learn those moves.

1248
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,690
I should learn it so I can do it myself.

1249
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,410
(He distorts his face.)

1250
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,390
How can you look so different with the same facial expression as his?

1251
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,490
(Same face, different feeling)

1252
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,050
That's why I must learn.

1253
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,200
Should I bite my lower lip?

1254
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
You all have your own...

1255
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,610
special gestures.

1256
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,410
You have your own special gestures just like him.

1257
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,350
- We will show you one by one.
 -  Show us, please.

1258
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,180
Okay. Please show us.

1259
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,350
(The lesson starts.)

1260
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,420
All right, V!

1261
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,490
Wow.

1262
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,350
This is it!

1263
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,410
Do I do it like this?

1264
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,820
(Gary counterattacks with his ugly dance moves.)

1265
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,780
Jungkook.

1266
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,050
Look at him.

1267
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,850
Jong Kook, show us the old version of that dance.

1268
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,300
- Why?
 -  You know the old version.

1269
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,910
- Why should I?
 -  Come on.

1270
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,180
- It goes like this.
 -  Please...

1271
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,280
- show us some old dances.
 -  Like this.

1272
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,780
- This one.
 -  I can't do this alone.

1273
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,910
- What?
 -  I need one more person.

1274
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,010
- Haha, do it.
 -  Come with me.

1275
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,180
Dance like old idol groups.

1276
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,760
- Okay.
 -  Show us some old dances.

1277
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,950
(We'll show you something you have never imagined.)

1278
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,710
(Turbo's Jong Kook has a charismatic aura.)

1279
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,020
Come to the middle. Let's dance.

1280
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,120
In 1, 2, 3.

1281
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,350
I'll kneel in front later.

1282
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,390
(Two ugly guys side by side)

1283
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,380
Show us old ones.

1284
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,510
(Jong Kook and his ugly boys)

1285
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,650
(They dance seriously with passion.)

1286
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,660
You all dance differently.

1287
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,810
(We're here to give you energy.)

1288
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,480
- In 1, 2, 3!
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1289
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,450
(Three!)

1290
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,860
(Here we go!)

1291
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,710
(This is what we call retro swag.)

1292
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,790
Did you guys see?

1293
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,410
That's it.

1294
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,480
- We won.
 -  You did great.

1295
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,120
- We did it like this.
 -  Right.

1296
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,150
What about this one?

1297
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,850
- That's it.
 -  That was so nice.

1298
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,130
I liked the old ones.

1299
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,910
So what should we do with BTS?

1300
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,520
- Right.
 -  The fourth mission...

1301
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,150
is to move 300 boxes with...

1302
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,710
BTS.

1303
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,650
- 300 boxes?
 -  So we should carry them.

1304
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,420
- There are 300 boxes of ramyeon.
 -  Yes.

1305
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,150
You should use the handcart that has your team's initial on it...

1306
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,550
to move as many boxes as possible to your team's truck.

1307
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,890
Those who move more boxes will win.

1308
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,990
If you win, we'll donate the boxes you carried in your names.

1309
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,810
So please do your best.

1310
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,010
What if we lose? Do we have to pay money again?

1311
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,380
(If we lose, do we have to pay money again?)

1312
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,850
- Let's stop paying.
 -  If you lose...

1313
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,050
- Let's do it again.
 -  No, let's stop.

1314
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,750
If you lose, you must donate extra ramyeon which will be...

1315
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,650
the same amount as the originally donated ramyeon.

1316
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,780
- I see.
 -  We have to...

1317
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,010
You have to win in order to get another puzzle piece.

1318
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,050
- We only have one piece.
 -  But at the moment,

1319
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,690
you've obtained only one piece so far.

1320
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,180
- Please go to the start line.
 -  Okay.

1321
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,280
Let's go.

1322
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,980
Guys, let's do it seriously.

1323
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,410
- We can do it!
 -  Don't grab here. It's heavier.

1324
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,480
Okay.

1325
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,510
- Let's go for it.
 -  You won't be able to win easily.

1326
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,780
- Let's do it.
 -  I look forward to a nice game.

1327
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,790
Let's carry those first.

1328
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,110
(Will the members with a lot of experience win?)

1329
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,080
(Or will young BTS win?)

1330
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,780
(They'll load boxes in five spots and carry them to their trucks.)

1331
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,820
(Each team has their own truck.)

1332
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,390
Ready...

1333
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,790
Let's go!

1334
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,910
(The race has begun.)

1335
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,130
(Run!)

1336
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,310
- Gosh.
 -  They're so fast.

1337
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,660
Goodness, they're so fast.

1338
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,280
They run really fast.

1339
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,750
Hey, get out!

1340
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,450
(He takes boxes even before the handcart arrives.)

1341
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,030
Get out, get out.

1342
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,660
(He doesn't wait for the handcart, but runs to the truck right away.)

1343
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,080
Just take it there.

1344
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,450
(BTS has 3 boxes and Running Man has 0.)

1345
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,110
Hey, get out!

1346
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,450
(BTS's handcart is going really fast.)

1347
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,450
(Their strategy is to move as many as possible at once.)

1348
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,580
Won't they fall?

1349
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,290
Is it enough?

1350
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,320
Go first.

1351
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,980
(J-Hope pushes the cart with 10 boxes.)

1352
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,120
This is heavier than I thought.

1353
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,820
Get out of the way.

1354
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,660
Gosh!

1355
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,610
(Cheating expert, Kwang Soo, attacks the cart.)

1356
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,620
Stop it!

1357
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,060
(They hug Kwang Soo.)

1358
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,610
Stop him.

1359
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,180
Hey, take boxes from them!

1360
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,310
(Jimin and V hold onto Kwang Soo.)

1361
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,850
- We have to take their boxes!
 -  No!

1362
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,590
- Hurry!
 -  We have to protect ours!

1363
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,750
(BTS members are loading the cart.)

1364
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,880
(But their cart suddenly leaves.)

1365
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,950
Seok Jin!

1366
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,150
(Thief, Seok Jin, shows up.)

1367
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,410
Seok Jin! No!

1368
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,660
(Jin struggles against Seok Jin.)

1369
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,950
Seok Jin, that's our ramyeon.

1370
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,210
- That's ours.
 -  Seok Jin, stop!

1371
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,510
Let's try again. These are ours.

1372
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,930
What's this?

1373
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,160
These aren't ours.

1374
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,860
What's going on?

1375
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,460
Gosh, this is so difficult.

1376
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,780
(Jung Kook attacks Running Man's cart.)

1377
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,710
Hey! Hey, hey!

1378
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,480
(Jung Kook interrupts Jae Seok and Seok Jin.)

1379
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,280
(Haha counterattacks immediately.)

1380
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,460
Hey, come here.

1381
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,950
- Gosh.
 -  No!

1382
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,350
(Thanks to Haha's defence, Jae Seok runs away.)

1383
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,720
- This is really hard.
 -  Hey!

1384
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,010
- Why are they so fast?
 -  Gosh, get out.

1385
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,290
- Hey! Stop.
 -  These aren't yours.

1386
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,890
These are ours.

1387
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,410
Jae Seok!

1388
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,980
(Jae Seok loads the truck, but...)

1389
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,480
Thank you, Jae Seok.

1390
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,580
(Thanks, Jae Seok.)

1391
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,660
Isn't this truck ours?

1392
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,350
No, it's not!

1393
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,450
Thank you, Jae Seok.

1394
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,590
(BTS: 28, Running Man: 14)

1395
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,320
Why are they so competitive?

1396
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,460
They always work hard.

1397
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,410
(A BTS member even attacks Running Man's truck.)

1398
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,490
Stop!

1399
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,120
I can't move!

1400
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,290
Jong Kook!

1401
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,580
Just get him.

1402
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,620
Where's the cart?

1403
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,280
Where's the cart?

1404
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,380
(Jimin even rides on Kwang Soo's back.)

1405
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,450
(Jimin marks Kwang Soo up close.)

1406
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,960
Gosh, take this.

1407
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,450
I am almost there.

1408
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,520
(Out of breath)

1409
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,920
(Every step Kwang Soo takes is extremely difficult.)

1410
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,820
I want to take their boxes away!

1411
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,410
I want to interrupt them!

1412
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,220
(He wants to interrupt them.)

1413
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,650
(Kwang Soo...)

1414
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,590
(is well known to be a cheating expert.)

1415
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:01,860
(But now, he desperately wants to...)

1416
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,350
(freely interrupt BTS.)

1417
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,790
(He wants to be free like a butterfly.)

1418
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,830
(But he is caught by Jimin.)

1419
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:10,950
Hey!

1420
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:11,980
You're on your own.

1421
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,920
(Kwang Soo, you'd better give up now.)

1422
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,910
Hey! Stop them!

1423
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,990
- Is it ours?
 -  Yes.

1424
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,580
I can't stand it any more.

1425
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,020
(He can't stand it.)

1426
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:25,790
That's it.

1427
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,320
(Jong Kook is angry.)

1428
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,210
(He holds Suga and Jung Kook at once.)

1429
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,390
Hurry up, now!

1430
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,860
Hey, get him now!

1431
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:38,810
(The BTS members are knocked down.)

1432
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,090
Please, stop.

1433
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,010
- Gosh.
 -  Jong Kook, help me.

1434
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,150
Go on!

1435
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,210
(Jong Kook separates Jimin from Kwang Soo with his hand.)

1436
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,650
(Jong Kook ties down three boys on his own.)

1437
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,560
- Good.
 -  Go!

1438
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,750
(He has taken care of 3 BTS members.)

1439
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,510
- What's going on here?
 -  What is this?

1440
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,880
- What's happening here?
 -  Gosh.

1441
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,220
- Please, let me go.
 -  I want to get out.

1442
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,690
Please, let me go!

1443
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,110
The Running Man team carried 62 boxes so far.

1444
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,190
Let's go.

1445
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,950
(Running Man member caught up to BTS.)

1446
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,490
There's nothing on it. Why are you carrying it?

1447
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,590
(Haha's interception)

1448
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,960
(Running Man members are doing their best to get a puzzle piece.)

1449
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,260
This is it. Stop them.

1450
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,210
- Gary, please don't.
 -  Let me have just one.

1451
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,620
- If you win rock, paper, scissors.
 -  Okay.

1452
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,660
- Rock, paper...
 -  Gary!

1453
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,680
(Running away)

1454
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,610
Gary! Gary!

1455
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,690
Gary!

1456
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,310
This is the last one.

1457
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,560
(The Running Man team makes a final sprint.)

1458
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,150
(The game is over.)

1459
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,160
You did well.

1460
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,110
- Good job.
 -  Good work.

1461
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,710
- You did well.
 -  Great job.

1462
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,950
- Good job.
 -  Thanks.

1463
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,150
Everyone did a good job.

1464
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,430
(The 7 vs 300 Boxes game is over.)

1465
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,760
This special is so hard.

1466
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,150
Let me announce the result.

1467
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,710
It's 157 boxes to 143 boxes.

1468
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,530
(157 to 143)

1469
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,580
(The Running Man team should beat BTS...)

1470
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,780
(in order to obtain the puzzle needed for the final mission.)

1471
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,110
(Who will be the winner?)

1472
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,820
BTS won.

1473
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,710
(BTS won!)

1474
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,810
We made it!

1475
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,250
(They failed to get a puzzle piece in this round.)

1476
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,380
We were fired up!

1477
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,380
As the Running Man members lost,

1478
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,910
you should pay for another 300 boxes of ramyeon to donate.

1479
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:15,990
- Sure.
 -  Good.

1480
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
Let's play the game of luck.

1481
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,580
Again?

1482
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,050
Do you want to play the game of luck?

1483
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,480
- Divide the number of boxes.
 -  Let's divide the number of boxes.

1484
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,110
- Donation is a good thing.
 -  It is...

1485
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,810
- This...
 -  It's good to be chosen.

1486
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,550
It is a nice thing to be the one who pays for ramyeon.

1487
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,150
We should smile happily.

1488
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,080
- Let's make it 250 boxes.
 -  That's a good idea.

1489
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,180
(Someone must pay for 250 boxes.)

1490
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,750
- It's a happy deed.
 -  How much is 250 boxes of ramyeon?

1491
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,880
- That wouldn't be that much.
 -  It won't be expensive.

1492
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,210
- Let's make it 250 boxes and...
 -  Is it 500 dollars?

1493
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,310
It's 5,000 dollars.

1494
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,360
(5,000 dollars)

1495
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,380
- 5,000 dollars for 250 boxes?
 -  Really?

1496
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,610
(Did you just say 5,000 dollars?)

1497
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,450
What? 5,000 dollars?

1498
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,410
- Really?
 -  5,000 dollars?

1499
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,420
- Let's make it 200 boxes then.
 -  5,000 dollars!

1500
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,710
- 5,000 dollars!
 -  Let's make it 200 boxes.

1501
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,810
- All right.
 -  I'm nervous.

1502
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,880
That's a lot of money.

1503
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,480
How many boxes will we buy other than 250 boxes?

1504
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,080
There will be 200, 50, 30, 15 and...

1505
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,880
- Five. If you get none, you dance.
 -  Five, and dance if you get none.

1506
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,750
- That's right.
 -  I'll be glad to dance.

1507
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,250
- Let's step back.
 -  Oh, please.

1508
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,480
Then, BTS members will pick a random card...

1509
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,650
- for us.
 -  All right.

1510
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,680
- I want Jungkook to pick mine.
 -  Okay.

1511
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,880
- Good.
 -  Okay.

1512
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,920
- I want Rap Monster.
 -  Okay.

1513
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,350
(The random donation starts.)

1514
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,060
- Let's do it together.
 -  Go for it.

1515
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,650
(Suga is the first to choose.)

1516
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,280
- Okay.
 -  Where's Jimin?

1517
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,150
- Pick one with your own pose.
 -  Give it to her right away.

1518
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,460
- Do your own pose.
 -  With your pose.

1519
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,610
This is for you.

1520
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,480
(How many boxes will Ji Hyo have to pay for?)

1521
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,160
Next is Jin.

1522
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,070
- Okay, Jin.
 -  Dance for us.

1523
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,920
Show us something before you give it to him.

1524
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,210
- Great.
 -  That's it.

1525
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,120
- Good.
 -  That's right.

1526
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,910
Great.

1527
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,650
Look at V. He's tired.

1528
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,250
He looks like he doesn't want to do this.

1529
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,160
- Please, just take it.
 -  He's tired.

1530
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,080
We didn't see enough of your dance.

1531
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,380
- Gosh.
 -  J-Hope is tired of waiting.

1532
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,650
Next is J-Hope!

1533
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,780
(What card will Haha have?)

1534
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,770
- J-Hope!
 -  You're good!

1535
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,280
(Jumping)

1536
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,380
(J-Hope delivers Jae Seok's card right away with Jae Seok's dance.)

1537
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,500
Next.

1538
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,820
- Rap Monster!
 -  Yes!

1539
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,250
- Who is it?
 -  Gary.

1540
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,780
- Gary.
 -  You guys look alike.

1541
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,860
(Rap Monster brings Gary a card.)

1542
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,360
Let's go.

1543
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,260
(Bang!)

1544
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:19,780
(Jungkook gives a card to Jong Kook.)

1545
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,080
Thank you. Thanks.

1546
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,350
This is...

1547
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,710
Jimin, you can do it!

1548
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:25,980
(The last one is Jimin.)

1549
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,920
Take it out from your back.

1550
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,750
Kwang Soo, take the card.

1551
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,760
- What if that's 200 boxes?
 -  Now...

1552
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,710
(Each member has a card for the donation.)

1553
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,250
Let's find out what our cards say.

1554
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,950
- Shall I go first?
 -  Who should go first?

1555
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,610
- Haha will go first.
 -  Okay.

1556
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,110
Please show us your card.

1557
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,650
Oh, please.

1558
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,180
- In 3, 2, 1.
 -  200 boxes. 200 boxes.

1559
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,050
(Will he have the honour of paying for 200 boxes?)

1560
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,060
(What will Haha's card say?)

1561
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,560
50 boxes.

1562
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,310
(Haha gets 50 boxes.)

1563
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,980
50 boxes is a vague number.

1564
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,250
Congratulations.

1565
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,250
- You get to donate.
 -  Your donation is unnoticeable.

1566
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,150
- Congratulations.
 -  Congratulations.

1567
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,380
But everybody,

1568
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,610
that means one of you has to donate 200 boxes.

1569
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,720
Gary's next.

1570
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,610
- 200.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1571
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,710
(Dance!)

1572
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,010
- "Dance".
 -  "Dance".

1573
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,160
Oh my goodness!

1574
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,860
(Oh, no!)

1575
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,860
Dance! With you!

1576
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,650
That's amazing.

1577
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,710
(Gary and Rap Monster share a strong chemistry.)

1578
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,490
You're on fire!

1579
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,020
- "Dance".
 -  I'm envious.

1580
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,370
Gary and Ji Hyo are so lucky.

1581
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,210
- Ji Hyo.
 -  Choose 200.

1582
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,080
- 200.
 -  You might get 200.

1583
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,700
- Suga.
 -  There might be a twist.

1584
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,260
- Let's make it special.
 -  It's about time.

1585
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,810
(What will be Ji Hyo's fate?)

1586
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,580
- Three.
 -  It's about time.

1587
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,880
(She gets 15 boxes.)

1588
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,380
- 15.
 -  It's not 200.

1589
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,770
200 is still left.

1590
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,610
It's you guys again.

1591
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,750
- It's the unlucky ones again.
 -  Jong Kook, do you want to switch?

1592
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,810
- Should we switch?
 -  Jong Kook.

1593
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,390
- Do you want to go first?
 -  Jong Kook!

1594
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,850
- I'm getting hopeful.
 -  He got shot earlier.

1595
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,580
- You're born with bad luck.
 -  It's the same even...

1596
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,650
- if it was chosen by other people.
 -  That's strange.

1597
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,780
(There are 200, 30, 5 and 0 boxes left.)

1598
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,350
- Let's go with Jong Kook first.
 -  200.

1599
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,260
We have bad luck, but he always picks the large numbers.

1600
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,700
- Is that right?
 -  I hope it's 200.

1601
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,150
- It's for a good cause.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1602
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,310
(Will Jong Kook get 200 boxes?)

1603
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:18,210
(Or will he be the lucky one to get 0 boxes?)

1604
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,890
In 1, 2, 3.

1605
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,490
(Wow!)

1606
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,150
Two, three.

1607
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,780
(He gets 0 boxes.)

1608
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,050
- Why?
 -  What is it?

1609
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,720
- That's amazing.
 -  Good job.

1610
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,680
That's so amazing.

1611
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,810
(Jong Kook gets 0 boxes.)

1612
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,690
It's all or nothing now.

1613
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,910
It's all or nothing, guys.

1614
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,060
It's us again.

1615
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,250
Do you want to switch like before?

1616
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,650
- Do you want to?
 -  I don't want to.

1617
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,810
Do you want to see it and then switch?

1618
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,680
- You can't react to it.
 -  You can't.

1619
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,150
You must not show any reactions.

1620
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,680
- Let's open it up.
 -  200 boxes!

1621
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,180
Please give us music.

1622
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,550
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Two, three.

1623
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,590
(They'll reveal their cards first.)

1624
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:03,750
(Who has chosen 200 boxes?)

1625
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,960
- Two, three.
 -  Two, three.

1626
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,550
(It is Kwang Soo.)

1627
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,880
Close them.

1628
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,250
Do you want to switch or not?

1629
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,650
- Switch!
 -  Dance, everybody.

1630
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,220
- Let's go.
 -  Dance.

1631
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:19,080
- Come on.
 -  Switch with whomever you want.

1632
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,420
(They're looking for the right time to switch cards.)

1633
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,410
- Are you on your own?
 -  Switch now.

1634
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,680
- Did you come on your own?
 -  Yes.

1635
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,810
- Would you like to switch?
 -  No way.

1636
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,060
No way.

1637
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,180
Why aren't you switching with me?

1638
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,860
Let's switch, Seok Jin.

1639
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,150
- Let's switch.
 -  Yes!

1640
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,340
- Yes.
 -  There you go.

1641
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,720
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo switch cards.)

1642
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,710
- Shall we switch?
 -  Should we reveal our cards?

1643
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,780
- Should we reveal them?
 -  Once again?

1644
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,920
- Three.
 -  Three.

1645
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,810
(Seok Jin has 200 boxes.)

1646
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,550
- Should we go again?
 -  Let's go again.

1647
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,900
Okay!

1648
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,550
(Let's shake it up!)

1649
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,660
Let's dance.

1650
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,580
We can switch once we agree on it.

1651
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,450
(They don't know what their future holds.)

1652
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,970
Jae Seok, let's switch.

1653
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,510
He wants to switch.

1654
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,040
(He makes a gesture toward Jae Seok.)

1655
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,810
(He takes the bait.)

1656
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,590
- Would you like to switch with me?
 -  Switch again.

1657
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,250
(Shall I switch again?)

1658
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,850
(This will change their destiny.)

1659
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,950
(What will become of these two?)

1660
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,620
(There you go!)

1661
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,980
I have a good feeling.

1662
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,680
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo switch cards.)

1663
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,720
(Kwang Soo is oblivious.)

1664
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,110
That's it.

1665
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,650
Whoever has 200 boxes, just dance along.

1666
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,180
- This is exciting.
 -  It's good.

1667
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,880
This is fun.

1668
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,450
Everybody, this is for a good cause.

1669
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,810
- That's right.
 -  Of course.

1670
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,080
- This is for donation.
 -  That's right.

1671
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,410
We must send these off...

1672
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,380
- willingly.
 -  If you get picked,

1673
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,680
you need to send these off with a smile.

1674
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,410
If you get picked, how would you celebrate it?

1675
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:52,080
- Pardon? I will passionately...
 -  I will dance passionately.

1676
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,980
- pour water over my head.
 -  Me, too.

1677
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,550
You have to act happy, okay?

1678
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,710
(He's getting ready.)

1679
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,110
- Get the water ready.
 -  This will be interesting.

1680
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,720
- Let's go.
 -  One,

1681
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,280
two, three.

1682
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,390
(Congratulations, Kwang Soo!)

1683
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,190
Can we see it?

1684
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,790
(What's this?)

1685
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,990
(Kwang Soo gets 200 boxes.)

1686
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,560
(Flapping)

1687
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,290
(He's full of joy.)

1688
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,580
200 boxes, 200 boxes

1689
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,990
5,000 dollars and 200 boxes

1690
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,860
- Good job.
 -  He's funny.

1691
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,580
Good job, Kwang Soo.

1692
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:39,480
You're the unluckiest person.

1693
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,450
You're the most unlucky one.

1694
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,780
- You're the most unlucky.
 -  You're unbeatable.

1695
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,010
- Who had it in the beginning?
 -  I...

1696
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,210
- Kwang Soo.
 -  I switched with him in the end.

1697
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,870
It was his from the beginning.

1698
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,610
Was it his from the beginning? I switched with him in the end.

1699
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,190
He took it back.

1700
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,780
(Kwang Soo had 200 boxes in the beginning.)

1701
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,750
(He gave it to Seok Jin, and it moved onto Jae Seok.)

1702
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,150
(It went around and came back to him.)

1703
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,590
I have a good feeling.

1704
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,750
Jimin, why are you doing this to me all day?

1705
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,850
I'm so envious. I should have kept the card.

1706
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,490
- It's for a good cause.
 -  Are you sure?

1707
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,560
- This is for real.
 -  You took it back.

1708
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,180
- Sure.
 -  I should have had it.

1709
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,010
- Are you sad about it?
 -  All right.

1710
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,220
Shall we move on?

1711
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,210
- Thank you for your hard work.
 -  Thank you.

1712
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,510
Thank you all.

1713
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,410
- Good work.
 -  Thank you.

1714
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,750
(What's the next game that awaits them?)

1715
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,920
- Thank you.
 -  Good work. See you later.

1716
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,860
We only got one puzzle piece.

1717
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,170
We should have at least one more.

1718
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,350
- We need one more.
 -  We need another piece.

1719
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,780
- We don't have enough.
 -  The opponents were too strong.

1720
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,720
- The cameramen were strong.
 -  We can't beat them.

1721
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,030
What will we do now? What do we have left?

1722
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,450
- The box game, too.
 -  Wouldn't it have...

1723
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,080
something to do with 300 people?

1724
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,210
We haven't had a game with 300 people yet.

1725
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,580
- Ripping name tags.
 -  We can't do that with 300 people.

1726
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,050
- We'll be worn out.
 -  Is there a game...

1727
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,020
300 people can play?

1728
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,550
- 300 people...
 -  Whatever it may be,

1729
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:10,510
- we can't win if it's 300 vs 7.
 -  It's impossible.

1730
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,210
- Whatever that might be.
 -  What could it be?

1731
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,580
- I think it'll be 300 people.
 -  We can't do 300 versus 7.

1732
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,450
We can't win if it's 300 versus 7.

1733
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:19,160
We're near a university.

1734
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:25,460
(It can't be 300 people, right?)

1735
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,310
(Y University in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul)

1736
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,060
(What awaits them here?)

1737
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:39,520
(The atmosphere seems a bit unusual.)

1738
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,090
- What's that?
 -  What's going on?

1739
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,580
- Are we starting right away?
 -  Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1740
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,750
(Noisy)

1741
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,380
(As they approach the gymnasium, the noise gets louder.)

1742
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:59,420
(What will be inside?)

1743
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,950
(They exclaim as soon as they walk in.)

1744
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,480
Look at this.

1745
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,650
What's all this?

1746
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,410
(What did they see?)

1747
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:14,260
(Wow! They have goosebumps.)

1748
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,660
(300 people stand in front of the Running Man members.)

1749
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:23,850
This is...

1750
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,000
(Overwhelmed)

1751
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,790
There are actually 300 of them.

1752
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,090
(300 university students)

1753
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,410
(300 youths welcome Running Man.)

1754
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,520
Wow, look.

1755
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,690
(The gymnasium is getting heated up.)

1756
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,060
Wow, look.

1757
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,880
(This is a very big-scale.)

1758
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,160
Nice to meet you!

1759
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,310
(Their hearts flutter for Running Man.)

1760
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,490
This is too much.

1761
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,010
- What do we do?
 -  This is not possible.

1762
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,540
We lost.

1763
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,790
- This doesn't make any sense.
 -  No way.

1764
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,460
How do we beat this enthusiasm?

1765
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,160
(They're stunned.)

1766
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,180
(What game do they have to play?)

1767
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,180
- This mission...
 -  What is it?

1768
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,660
(Please don't let it involve 300 people.)

1769
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,450
It is 7 vs 300 people.

1770
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,510
(Do the 7 of them have to beat 300 people?)

1771
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,880
How could we go against 300?

1772
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,210
- How's that possible?
 -  We can't win.

1773
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,750
- How can we win?
 -  What do we do?

1774
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,990
The only thing I have is that I'm older than them.

1775
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,850
I can beat them with my age.

1776
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,490
To start off,

1777
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:34,020
the first person to face 300 people is...

1778
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,250
(Please don't let it be me.)

1779
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,160
- Yu Jae Seok.
 -  Me?

1780
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:43,390
(Jae Seok is chosen.)

1781
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,190
Me? What do I do?

1782
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:54,040
- Yu Jae Seok!
 -  Yu Jae Seok!

1783
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,310
This is the game Jae Seok is going to play.

1784
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,490
- What is it?
 -  The game you will play...

1785
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,710
(This is the first game of their match.)

1786
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:06,980
The game you will play is "Slap-Match".

1787
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,560
I should have done this.

1788
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,720
(Slap-Match)

1789
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:14,120
(Slap-Match)

1790
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,080
Hold on.

1791
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,860
How many people do I have to beat?

1792
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,700
You'll place your game pieces on the floor,

1793
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,810
- and Jae Seok will go first.
 -  Maybe they're bad.

1794
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:26,110
If it gets flipped, it's Jae Seok's win.

1795
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,380
You have to get it in one try.

1796
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,780
If I don't get it in one try, I'm in trouble.

1797
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,210
- But there's a limit to that.
 -  But I'm guessing these...

1798
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,110
young students haven't played this game before.

1799
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,380
- Have you played this before?
 -  We have!

1800
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,760
Have you?

1801
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,350
(He didn't think they would have played it.)

1802
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,560
Did you really?

1803
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,420
(These young people have played slap-matches before.)

1804
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,850
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1805
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:51,890
(Jae Seok is a strong player, but he has to face 300 people.)

1806
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,360
(The 1st player appears.)

1807
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,860
(He seems very relaxed.)

1808
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,790
I will attack first.

1809
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,960
(He's nervous.)

1810
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,150
(300 people shout to support him.)

1811
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,560
- Go, Player One!
 -  Go, Jae Seok!

1812
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,000
(And the 7 Running Man members start cheering loudly, too.)

1813
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,220
(In front of 300 people, they rather look shabby.)

1814
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,400
(We need to somehow forestall them.)

1815
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,880
(Seok Jin pretends to give him a hug and rips his name tag.)

1816
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,830
(This is Running Man!)

1817
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,930
(Ripping)

1818
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,160
(Don't you dare!)

1819
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,890
(This is the spirit of youth.)

1820
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,650
It hurts.

1821
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,520
We can't beat them.

1822
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,280
You should put yours down first.

1823
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,250
They are unbelievable.

1824
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,570
I have only one chance.

1825
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,910
What if I lose immediately?

1826
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,250
You will be fine. You won't lose immediately.

1827
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,410
- Please beat at least one person.
 -  He can do that.

1828
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,060
Have you played this before?

1829
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,750
- I played it when I was little.
 -  How old were you?

1830
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,980
I was in elementary school.

1831
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,210
In elementary school?

1832
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,980
- But even so...
 -  Right.

1833
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,050
That's the late 90s, right?

1834
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,540
(He was in elementary school in the late 90s.)

1835
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,680
- Right?
 -  Right?

1836
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,120
- Yes.
 -  Was it in 2000s?

1837
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,830
- Was it in the 2000s?
 -  Yes.

1838
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,660
It was already the 2000s when you were in elementary school?

1839
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,950
- Yes. I was born in 1996.
 -  Really?

1840
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,480
- You were born in 1996?
 -  In 1996?

1841
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,750
You were born in 1996!

1842
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,860
- 96...
 -  Then...

1843
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,390
- He was born in 1996.
 -  Then...

1844
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,090
1996?

1845
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,290
I met my wife in 1997.

1846
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,350
(If Seok Jin got married and had a son, his son would be his age.)

1847
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,960
I met my wife in 1997.

1848
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,090
- You're okay, right?
 -  Yes.

1849
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,250
- Let's go!
 -  Let's go!

1850
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,830
- Beat him at once!
 -  Let's go!

1851
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,040
Go, Jae Seok!

1852
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,710
- Go, Jae Seok!
 -  Go, Player One!

1853
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,220
(The 300 people's cheering is on a different scale.)

1854
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,180
We are lovely from head to toe

1855
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,710
(He sings Jong Kook's song.)

1856
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,990
We are lovely from head to toe

1857
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,980
(What are you doing?)

1858
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,190
What are you doing?

1859
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,780
(He can dance to it, too.)

1860
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,520
Jae Seok, please focus.

1861
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,060
Here's the rule.

1862
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,950
The game will continue until...

1863
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,440
- Jae Seok loses.
 -  You can do it.

1864
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,710
- You are very good at it.
 -  Yes.

1865
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:56,890
It will get flipped no matter what.

1866
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,360
(He never lost.)

1867
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,310
(For the past 300 episodes, he's been the King of "Slap-Match".)

1868
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,600
(He's the only man who can compete against 300 people.)

1869
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,790
(Will he be able to create another legend today?)

1870
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,030
It will get flipped no matter what.

1871
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:13,410
- This is...
 -  You get one chance.

1872
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,550
It's so nerve-racking...

1873
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:17,150
- to compete against 300 people.
 -  Hey, you...

1874
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:19,880
- They are all looking at me.
 -  You are the king.

1875
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,520
- I've never played it like this.
 -  Jae Seok, you have...

1876
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,660
to beat at least 50 people alone.

1877
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,680
- You are the king.
 -  You're good.

1878
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,380
- You have to beat 50 people.
 -  You can do it.

1879
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,880
- This is not ridiculous.
 -  You're the best player here.

1880
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,010
You are the hero.

1881
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,950
- You're the man.
 -  You are the hero.

1882
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:39,830
(He's pressured to compete against 300 people alone.)

1883
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,680
(He will be in trouble if he fails on the first try.)

1884
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,980
(He slaps the card...)

1885
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:47,020
(with full power!)

1886
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,110
(It flies...)

1887
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,510
(but lands on the same side.)

1888
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:55,710
(Jae Seok fails.)

1889
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,860
(He's saved.)

1890
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,050
It's Player One's turn now.

1891
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,680
What do I do, Ji Hyo? I hit it too hard.

1892
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,290
His name is Wan Seong.

1893
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,010
(Using the interview as an excuse,)

1894
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,720
(they step on the card to stop it from flipping easily.)

1895
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,450
(They always think of ways to cheat.)

1896
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,120
Gosh, you guys...

1897
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,080
Hold on.

1898
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,360
It will get flipped for sure.

1899
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,850
Step back a little.

1900
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,710
(They tease the young boy.)

1901
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,350
We can't help it. We've been living like this our whole lives.

1902
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,580
Anyway, we have to win.

1903
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,820
Haha, step back.

1904
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,460
- It's Wan Seong's turn.
 -  Step back.

1905
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,680
(He looks like a good player.)

1906
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,050
You suck!

1907
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,550
(You've played this before, haven't you?)

1908
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,210
(Then it's time to play the mind games!)

1909
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,320
Here we go.

1910
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,250
(He slaps the card...)

1911
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,420
(without any hesitation.)

1912
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,210
(He's got power...)

1913
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,480
(and perfect aiming!)

1914
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,110
(The card flies in the air!)

1915
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:44,780
(7 Running Men vs 300 university students)

1916
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,260
(How will the competition end?)

1917
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,050
(7 vs 300 Part 2)

1918
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,590
We will be ripped and torn!

1919
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:57,010
How can we beat them?

1920
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,260
We lost.

1921
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:02,420
(It's youth versus experience. They will bet everything they have.)

1922
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,710
(A black cloud unfolded like an umbrella, and it was our turn.)

1923
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,020
(Aren't you afraid? Every night, we were left alone. By Gi Hyeong Do)

1924
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,880
(There is someone in this pitch darkness.)

1925
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,050
Just tell us this.

1926
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,120
Is it up there?

1927
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,370
(People in the dark go after the Running Man members.)

1928
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,920
(It's not over until it's over. Do not lose your guard.)

1929
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,330
(300th Episode Special: 7 vs 300 Part 2)
