(300th Episode Special)

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,670
(7 vs 300 Part 2)

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,790
(The 300th Episode Special is continued.)

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,840
(Special tests in celebration of the 300th episode are awaiting.)

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,470
It's the 300th Episode Special,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,140
7 vs 300.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,030
- 7 vs 300?
 -  What?

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,160
(The grand match has already begun.)

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,170
What is it?

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,130
("Running Man Quiz")

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,730
("300m Essay")

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,800
("300 Bowls")

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,170
"300 Boxes"!

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,860
(The 7 members must become one.)

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,030
It's so painful.

16
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,050
(It's them against the number "300".)

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,490
(When they reach their limit,)

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,270
(they must face even greater opponents.)

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,960
(Y University in Seoul)

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,000
(What kind of "300" is waiting for them?)

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,270
Which university is it?

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Let's go up.

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,390
(What is...)

24
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,830
(inside...)

25
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,240
(this building?)

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,830
(They can't help but exclaim as soon as they step into the gym.)

27
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,760
- Seok Jin.
 -  What is that?

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,740
(What did they see?)

29
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,630
(Wow!)

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,540
(The sight gives them the chills.)

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,330
What is that?

32
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,700
(300 people are waiting for the Running Man members.)

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Look at this.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,890
(Overwhelmed)

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,370
There are really 300 of them.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,840
(There are 300 young men and women.)

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,260
(Wow!)

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,400
Look at this.

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,060
(Amidst the young spirits,)

40
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,640
(the game begins.)

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,700
Look at this.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,760
(7 vs 300: The Fourth Mission)

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,870
Nice to see you all.

44
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,670
(Bowing)

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,440
It's astounding.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,690
- Since when were they here?
 -  I don't know.

47
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,860
We lost.

48
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,130
We can't win this.

49
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,270
- But really,
 -  Look at this spirit.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,470
how can we beat this energy?

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,570
(It's hopeless.)

52
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,440
- The name of this mission is...
 -  What is it?

53
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,640
"300 People".

54
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,430
(Do they want us to fight and beat 300 people?)

55
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,730
How can 7 beat 300?

56
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,030
- There's no way we can win this.
 -  What do you mean?

57
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,300
- What is this?
 -  How can we win this match?

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,040
We're older. We can beat them with our age.

59
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,100
We're just older.

60
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,840
The first person...

61
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,170
to go up against 300 people is...

62
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,960
(Please, not me)

63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,090
Jae Seok.

64
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,230
Me?

65
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,940
(Jae Seok is the first player.)

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,470
Am I?

67
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Am I the first?

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,090
- Yu Jae Seok!
 -  Yu Jae Seok!

69
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,840
(What kind of match will he have against 300 people?)

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,930
The game Jae Seok will play will be revealed.

71
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,930
- What is it?
 -  The game will be...

72
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,530
(The game is...)

73
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,870
The game will be...

74
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,930
- Slap-Match.
 -  I should play that instead.

75
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,350
(Slap-Match is the first game.)

76
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,690
I should play this game.

77
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,630
(Slap-Match)

78
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,730
- Slap-Match against 300?
 -  Is that possible?

79
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,170
How many times do I need to play it?

80
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,430
The student's ddakji will be put on the ground first,

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,170
and Jae Seok will slap his ddakji first.

82
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,760
If the student's ddakji is flipped over, then Jae Seok wins.

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,130
You have to flip it at once.

84
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,760
If I fail to flip it at once, will I not have another chance?

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,970
(Jae Seok is really good at this, but can he beat 300 people?)

86
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,130
(Who is the first opponent to play against Jae Seok?)

87
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,770
(It's a strong and handsome guy.)

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,100
(The first opponent looks tough to beat already.)

89
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,770
- Number One!
 -  Jae Seok!

90
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,800
- Jae Seok!
 -  Number One!

91
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,530
- Jae Seok!
 -  Number One!

92
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,670
- Jae Seok!
 -  Jae Seok!

93
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
(This is how you do a pre-game chant.)

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,790
Akaraka

95
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,260
- Akaraka!
 -  Akaraka!

96
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,220
(Akaraka!)

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,590
(Can you feel the energy?)

98
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,390
Us, too. We should do something.

99
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,440
(They are surely overwhelmed.)

100
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,300
(We can't step back like this.)

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,140
We should do something.

102
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,950
(How will the members cheer against this grand cheering?)

103
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm testing the microphone.

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,730
- Running Man
 -  You're lovely

105
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,940
From top to bottom

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,540
(What are you doing?)

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
(They are so funny.)

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,040
Please focus, Jae Seok.

109
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,770
I'm telling you.

110
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,390
- Jae Seok will play until he loses.
 -  You can do this.

111
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,260
You can do it. You're good at this.

112
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,460
- He is.
 -  You know you're good at this.

113
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,640
You will flip it at once. You will.

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,330
- You're the dominator of this game.
 -  Go.

115
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,030
(After a deep breath, he throws his ddakji.)

116
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,360
(The ddakji flies high in the air.)

117
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
(What's the result?)

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,240
(Jae Seok failed.)

119
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,450
That was so close.

120
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,790
- Don't worry.
 -  Jae Seok is at a disadvantage.

121
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,860
(Jae Seok failed. It's Team 300's turn.)

122
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,480
Jae Seok is at a disadvantage. It's Number One's turn.

123
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,570
Let's go.

124
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,130
(He gets ready.)

125
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,670
It would be a nightmare if he beat Jae Seok now.

126
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,300
(Hit it if you can.)

127
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,030
It's your turn, now.

128
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,190
(He slaps it hard right on Jae Seok's ddakji.)

129
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,830
(Will it end like this?)

130
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,960
It's your turn, now.

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,110
Oh, no.

132
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,640
Oh, no.

133
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,000
(It's not so easy.)

134
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,470
- Try not to slap too hard.
 -  It's Jae Seok's turn.

135
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,000
- I shouldn't slap it too hard.
 -  He should...

136
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,030
- take aim precisely this time.
 -  Hit it softly, not too hard.

137
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,160
(With caution, Jae Seok slaps his ddakji again.)

138
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
(I must end this here.)

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
(Precise targeting)

140
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,500
Okay!

141
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,990
(Jae Seok has won.)

142
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,000
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

143
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,870
(It was a match that showed Jae Seok's skills.)

144
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Number two, please come out.

145
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,770
(The second opponent appears with great aura.)

146
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,840
He's handsome.

147
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,230
I think...

148
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,360
I feel that...

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,370
I must flip it at once. I don't think I'll have another chance.

150
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,430
I think he'll be good at everything.

151
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,760
(Number Two seems to be good at Slap-Match.)

152
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,440
- Have you played this before?
 -  You must be good at sports.

153
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,740
- I major in sports.
 -  Wow.

154
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,930
(He's a sports major.)

155
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,230
(A sports major is here to beat Jae Seok.)

156
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,590
Here comes the challenger. Against this athletic student,

157
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,600
Jae Seok goes first!

158
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,290
- At once. At once.
 -  Flip it at once.

159
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,790
(This is only his second opponent.)

160
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,160
(There might be no second chance.)

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,690
(Jae Seok strikes.)

162
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,740
Don't hit too hard.

163
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,140
(Jae Seok fails.)

164
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,370
(No way.)

165
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,070
- What's your name?
 -  Number Two.

166
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,530
- Number Two!
 -  Number Two!

167
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,960
- He's Ji Seok.
 -  Oh Ji Seok?

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,870
It should flip that way.

169
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,690
- Please don't flip it.
 -  Your names are...

170
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,230
- Ji Seok.
 -  No, Ji Seok.

171
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,460
Go easy, Ji Seok.

172
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,850
(Please)

173
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,910
(I'll show everyone how athletic I am.)

174
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,460
(Fly like a butterfly...)

175
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,590
(and sting like a...)

176
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,790
Good job, Ji Seok.

177
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,200
Go easy, Ji Seok. Good job.

178
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,490
(Number Two fails.)

179
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,670
He's so bad.

180
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,100
(It's really hilarious.)

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
(Kwang Soo's exaggerated laughter makes everyone laugh.)

182
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,890
He missed.

183
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,170
- He missed his turn.
 -  You can do it.

184
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Okay.

185
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,030
(Jae Seok slaps hard without notice.)

186
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,570
(It flips!)

187
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,390
Jae Seok wins again.

188
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,660
(Jae Seok wins.)

189
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,960
That was good. Keep it up. Don't get relaxed yet.

190
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,570
Jae Seok is amazing.

191
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
He beat two opponents already. Number Three, please come out.

192
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, my. He's in good shape.

193
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,540
- Jae Seok is in trouble now.
 -  Please introduce yourself.

194
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,130
I'm Lee Won Jae from the Department of Physical Education.

195
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,350
Oh my goodness. Another athletic guy.

196
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,460
You're also a sports major?

197
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,860
What kind of sports are you good at?

198
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,990
I'm good at swimming.

199
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,030
Swimming? He must be good at this game.

200
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,590
You have broad shoulders.

201
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,330
(Due to extensive swimming, he can slap the ddakji hard.)

202
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,650
Jae Seok versus Number Three.

203
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,060
Jae Seok, you must defeat at least 50 students.

204
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,190
His shoulders are wider than yours.

205
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,630
- Jae Seok, you can do this.
 -  Jae Seok.

206
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,760
You must flip it at once.

207
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,830
Flip it at once. Do it while you still have the stamina.

208
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,130
(Perfect posture)

209
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,230
There you go.

210
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,740
(Jae Seok fails.)

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Your friend mentioned something about a Mosquito Dance.

212
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,890
- Mosquito Dance?
 -  Can you show us the dance?

213
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,630
Can you show it to us?

214
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,130
- In 1, 2.
 -  In 1, 2, 3, 4.

215
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,770
A huge mosquito bit my foot

216
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,970
(A shocking transformation)

217
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,830
It was itchy

218
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,230
(Kwang Soo's counterattack)

219
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,900
So I started to scratch my foot without thinking

220
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,200
It was itchy

221
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,430
(He is the descendant of the Mosquito Dance.)

222
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,760
- You're good at the dance.
 -  He is.

223
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,700
- He was good.
 -  Good job.

224
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Goodness.

225
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,430
This is the dance that Kwang Soo did in a sitcom.

226
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,430
- He danced this in a sitcom.
 -  Right.

227
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,360
- All right.
 -  He's a bit exhausted.

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,820
He's nervous.

229
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,700
- Go! Okay.
 -  Good.

230
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,960
(Number Three fails.)

231
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
You failed to flip it.

232
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,870
(You failed, too.)

233
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,200
(Jae Seok makes a quick attack.)

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,340
Great!

235
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,400
(Jae Seok flips it.)

236
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,940
Jae Seok wins.

237
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,700
- Good job.
 -  We have to keep the pace going.

238
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,070
- Number Four.
 -  We shouldn't let our guard down.

239
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,440
Please come out.

240
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,340
He seems like a cheerleader.

241
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,600
You're like a cheerleader. Please introduce yourself.

242
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,740
Hello, I'm Kim Joon Hyuk, majoring in Church Music.

243
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,430
- What's your major again?
 -  Church Music.

244
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,490
Church Music.

245
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,200
Are you good at this game?

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
When I was in high school, I was the best player in my town.

247
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,960
- Really?
 -  Yes.

248
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,770
- I think he played this a lot.
 -  Okay.

249
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,700
- He must be good.
 -  Knock him down at once.

250
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,370
- You can do it.
 -  Go!

251
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,540
- I failed.
 -  You slapped too hard.

252
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,900
Now, the best player in Sinwol-dong will go.

253
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,730
- I think he'll be really good.
 -  Be gentle.

254
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,890
(The best player in Sinwol-dong)

255
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,590
(He gives it a shot.)

256
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,400
(He also slaps it too hard and fails to flip the ddakji.)

257
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,810
- Jae Seok.
 -  Come here.

258
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,730
I can see that he's a good player.

259
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,540
(He is really good at this game.)

260
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,800
He's really good.

261
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,090
His being the best player is proven!

262
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,710
- He's so good.
 -  Get a hold of yourself.

263
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,210
- He has good power.
 -  He's good.

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,090
- Wow.
 -  He is superb.

265
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,760
He is a great player.

266
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,660
That's right. Jae Seok should beat at least 50 players for us.

267
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,340
But that won't be easy.

268
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,210
Okay. Go.

269
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,330
(Jae Seok's ddakji has left his hand.)

270
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,600
(Will he succeed in flipping the ddakji or not?)

271
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,370
(The ddakji turns but isn't flipped.)

272
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,800
Gosh.

273
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,130
I'll make sure to win this time.

274
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,890
Okay. I hope you don't.

275
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,730
- Do you have a girlfriend?
 -  Yes, I do.

276
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,200
- Is she pretty?
 -  Do you have a girlfriend?

277
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
- She's here.
 -  What's her name?

278
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,760
- She's there.
 -  Where?

279
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,340
- There she is.
 -  Wow.

280
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
- Wow.
 -  You two look alike.

281
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,560
- They look alike.
 -  You really do.

282
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,170
Please say something to your boyfriend.

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
You can do it, Joon Hyuk.

284
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,530
(What a sweet couple.)

285
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,070
I don't think he can do it.

286
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,510
(Boo!)

287
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,130
- Jae Seok! Jae Seok!
 -  Jae Seok! Jae Seok!

288
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,400
- We made it!
 -  Great!

289
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,890
- You will miss it this time.
 -  Oh, please.

290
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,760
- Your girlfriend is watching you.
 -  Look at your girlfriend.

291
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,330
(He throws the ddakji.)

292
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,570
(How will the fate of Jae Seok's crisis turn out?)

293
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,990
(He flips Jae Seok's ddakji.)

294
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,090
(This is unbelievable!)

295
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,370
(The best player of Sinwol-dong succeeds.)

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,790
(Jae Seok fails to beat the fourth player out of 300.)

297
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,870
- He's really good.
 -  He is.

298
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,490
- You did a good job.
 -  You're good.

299
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,860
- Okay.
 -  He's great.

300
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,790
(Now only 6 members are left.)

301
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,630
(Will they be able...)

302
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,990
(to beat the remaining 297 players?)

303
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,270
- Since I beat three players,
 -  Yes.

304
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,470
now we have...

305
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,600
- 297 players left.
 -  297 players.

306
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,740
There are 297 players left.

307
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,430
And we have six members on our team.

308
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,770
Those in the back rows might not be able to play games with us.

309
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,760
- Right.
 -  Because the game will finish.

310
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,660
Let's find out who the next player is.

311
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,530
- Let's take a look.
 -  I want to play at the end.

312
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,070
(Who will be the next player to overcome the crisis?)

313
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,640
It's Jong Kook.

314
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,130
(Shouldn't the ace go last?)

315
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,190
- Isn't it too early?
 -  They're already scared.

316
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,160
- I think they are.
 -  Isn't it too early?

317
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,460
- Already?
 -  Please show us the game.

318
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,590
(What game will Jong Kook play with the students?)

319
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,390
(Arm-Wrestling)

320
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,700
- Yes!
 -  This is great!

321
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,000
But there are too many players.

322
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,160
- Jong Kook, you can beat them.
 -  There are girls, too.

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,290
- But there are too many players.
 -  Okay.

324
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,770
Jong Kook, just beat 230 of them.

325
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,830
- He can do it.
 -  Please beat just 230 players.

326
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sure he can do it.

327
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,690
(His power is beyond our imagination.)

328
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,430
(His power is second to none.)

329
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,260
(Jong Kook is a legendary, talented guy.)

330
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,460
(He is unbeaten in arm-wrestling.)

331
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,430
(How many players will he be able to beat today?)

332
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,940
You're seriously amazing.

333
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,360
- Go fast and don't waste energy.
 -  He's right.

334
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,890
- But there are ladies as well.
 -  Although...

335
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,130
Jong Kook is good at arm-wrestling, there are too many people to win.

336
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,890
- He has to save his energy.
 -  Right.

337
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,660
- Come out.
 -  Joon Hyuk will go first then.

338
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,870
(The best player of Sinwol-dong goes first.)

339
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,260
- What if he wins?
 -  Now, Joon Hyuk...

340
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,430
will start arm-wrestling with Jong Kook.

341
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,530
- Beat him fast.
 -  I think...

342
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,090
All right.

343
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,190
(Jong Kook starts the first round.)

344
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,530
- Do I have to touch the pad?
 -  Yes, you do.

345
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,730
Get ready.

346
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,090
(If Jong Kook loses, Running Man will miss the chance to win.)

347
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,290
(A battle with the dark horse of Yonsei University)

348
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,330
(Who will become the winner in this first round?)

349
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,370
Start.

350
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,030
(It was a fast round.)

351
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,470
(Jong Kook's formidable power)

352
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
(Stunned)

353
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,590
Joon Hyuk's girlfriend is in great pain.

354
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,100
- It can't be helped.
 -  You feel...

355
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,700
(Joon Hyuk's girlfriend is having a hard time.)

356
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,900
You feel the same pain as him, don't you?

357
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,660
- See? We're very strong.
 -  Joon Hyuk disappeared so quickly.

358
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,930
(The dark horse loses.)

359
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,860
Then, it's Number Five's turn.

360
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,370
- She's a girl.
 -  It's a female student.

361
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,840
(Bewildered)

362
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,930
You know what we're playing now.

363
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,860
- You have to arm-wrestle.
 -  Right.

364
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,390
- It's just a game.
 -  You still have to do it.

365
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,500
The women can just think that it's a chance to hold Jong Kook's hand.

366
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,560
(She raises her hand.)

367
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,960
- Gary.
 -  Sorry?

368
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,840
- I want to hold Gary's hand.
 -  Do you want to hold Gary's hand?

369
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,140
But you'll arm-wrestle with Jong Kook.

370
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,260
(You want to hold Gary's hand?)

371
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,060
- You have to hold mine.
 -  Gosh.

372
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm sorry, but...

373
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,600
You can do it!

374
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Let's go!

375
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,460
- Now, I feel much better to play.
 -  Okay.

376
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,380
Jong Kook just said he feels much better about beating you now.

377
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,970
Goodbye.

378
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,800
(Bye.)

379
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,960
(Jae Seok says goodbye in advance.)

380
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,610
- You did a good job.
 -  You can do it.

381
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,440
Do you want to say anything to Jong Kook?

382
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,490
(What will she say to Jong Kook?)

383
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,930
- No.
 -  Okay.

384
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,060
(I don't.)

385
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,230
(I don't have anything to say.)

386
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,210
- Why did you ask that to her?
 -  She said no.

387
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,170
- She tried to bewilder Jong Kook.
 -  I don't either.

388
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,690
Let's just start!

389
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,870
It's good that both of you don't have anything to say to each other.

390
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,690
As the main host, it's good that you said nothing.

391
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,950
All right. Why are you grabbing her hand so tightly already?

392
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,990
- No, I'm not.
 -  Look at the veins in your arm.

393
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,360
- No, that's not true.
 -  Okay.

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,440
Ready.

395
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,590
Start.

396
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,840
(Jong Kook, be gentle to the female students.)

397
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
Finish it quickly.

398
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,560
(No mercy!)

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,530
(I'm sorry for not being cool.)

400
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,870
(All the students jeer and boo.)

401
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,440
All right.

402
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,060
Chae Ryung.

403
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,670
(This is for choosing Gary over me.)

404
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,830
- He's really mad.
 -  Do you have anything to say?

405
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,390
- This is funny.
 -  I don't.

406
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,540
You don't?

407
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,250
She doesn't have anything to say.

408
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,860
(You know I was just kidding.)

409
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,730
Thank you. Let's have the next player come out.

410
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,860
(It's Number 7's turn now.)

411
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,560
- He's cute.
 -  Can I...

412
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,240
- Sorry?
 -  Can I shake hands with Ji Hyo?

413
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,590
- Are you Ji Hyo's fan?
 -  Go ahead.

414
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,960
Do you have anything to say to Jong Kook?

415
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,000
No, I don't.

416
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,730
(Jong Kook is left out in the cold.)

417
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,590
Will you be okay?

418
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,000
- Let's start.
 -  He wants to hold Ji Hyo's hand.

419
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,660
(His wish comes true.)

420
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,840
All right.

421
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
- Now, are you ready?
 -  Yes.

422
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,330
(He wrings Jong Kook's hand tightly.)

423
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,760
We've tried that already to beat him.

424
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,450
- Right.
 -  How does his hand feel?

425
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,330
- It's as hard as bricks.
 -  Exactly.

426
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,030
- Don't expect to win.
 -  How many seconds will it take?

427
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,700
I'll end it in one second.

428
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,290
- One second?
 -  Are you sure?

429
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,390
- Of course.
 -  Okay.

430
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,000
Get ready.

431
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,770
Start.

432
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,890
(Jong Kook wins.)

433
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,540
Goodness.

434
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,970
- You're stronger than I thought.
 -  Really?

435
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,230
We're not weak. They're just strong.

436
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,830
- They're strong.
 -  We've beaten seven players so far.

437
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,090
Jong Kook should beat as many people as he can...

438
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,930
- for us to win.
 -  Right.

439
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,900
The next player, please come out.

440
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm sure Jong Kook can beat a lot for us.

441
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,190
If you think about it,

442
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,860
arm-wrestling isn't an easy game for women.

443
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,630
I'm Kwang Soo's fan. Can I shake his hand?

444
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,160
Do you want to shake his hand? Kwang Soo.

445
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
(Kwang Soo gladly shakes hands with his fan.)

446
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,440
Why doesn't Jong Kook have any fans?

447
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,660
(Kwang Soo suddenly twists his fan's arm.)

448
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
(Ultimately ill-mannered)

449
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,430
Kwang Soo.

450
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,140
- What was that?
 -  What is he doing?

451
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,590
- I twisted her arm.
 -  Gosh.

452
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,000
- Why did you twist her arm?
 -  He's not what you'd expected.

453
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,910
- Okay.
 -  I'm sorry.

454
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,900
(He pretends to apologise and twists her arm again.)

455
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,690
(I can't believe I'm a fan of a guy like him.)

456
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,790
Goodness.

457
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,790
- You're a scum.
 -  Gosh.

458
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,000
You're a piece of trash.

459
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,260
(Thumbs down)

460
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,400
This is how he is.

461
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,230
(He turns down his fan.)

462
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,800
(I still like you.)

463
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,490
- Do you still like him?
 -  That's incredible.

464
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,560
This is not a joke.

465
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,240
He twisted your arm twice and you still like him?

466
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,970
Get ready.

467
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,670
(Thank you for liking me still.)

468
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,130
Start.

469
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,290
(The game starts.)

470
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,530
Ga Yeon.

471
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,790
- Bye.
 -  I'm sorry.

472
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,440
(Jong Kook wins again.)

473
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,530
- Bye, Ga Yeon.
 -  Bye.

474
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,270
He looks pretty built.

475
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,630
(The next player is well-built.)

476
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,360
- Well, then.
 -  Nice to meet you.

477
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,440
Get ready.

478
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
- Let's move fast.
 -  Sure.

479
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,070
Ready.

480
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,100
Start.

481
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
(He tries to resist.)

482
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,400
(Jong Kook wins.)

483
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,270
- What's the matter?
 -  It's hard to stay still.

484
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,360
(He's on a different level.)

485
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,430
He's an incredible person.

486
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,490
He is, right?

487
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,470
Now do you see the troubles we must go through?

488
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,440
- It's been 6 years.
 -  It's 6 years.

489
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,490
We've been ripped apart for six years.

490
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,930
(They've stuck by each other for 6 years.)

491
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,090
Next is Number 10.

492
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,330
Look at him.

493
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,830
(Number 10 makes his entrance.)

494
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,800
(He's robust.)

495
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,360
(He doesn't look ordinary.)

496
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,900
- I'll hold this.
 -  You're wearing...

497
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,410
a very short bottom.

498
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,670
You look like...

499
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,190
somebody...

500
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,080
who works out a lot.

501
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,030
Jong Kook finally met someone on his level.

502
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,030
- It's Number 10.
 -  Right.

503
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,230
- By the way,
 -  Yes?

504
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,300
- I'm a big fan of his.
 -  Is that so?

505
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,830
(Oh, my brother!)

506
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,730
(Jong Kook is deeply moved by his fan.)

507
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm thankful.

508
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,470
I've been his fan since his Turbo days.

509
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,500
- Really?
 -  Are you an older student?

510
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,270
- Are you a returning student?
 -  Yes, I am.

511
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,660
I'm a returning student.

512
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,330
- I see.
 -  You're older than the rest.

513
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,100
I can tell you're a returning student.

514
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,630
- You look different.
 -  Don't say that.

515
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,960
- You have a different vibe.
 -  What do you mean?

516
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,670
Are you on the table tennis team by any chance?

517
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,610
Leave him alone.

518
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,870
- He wore it because it's hot.
 -  All right.

519
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,290
- Get ready.
 -  You should pull your shorts down.

520
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,490
- After facing...
 -  He looks strong.

521
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,960
seven people, Jong Kook met his match.

522
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,130
Set.

523
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:02,190
(It's a nerve-wracking moment. How will it turn out?)

524
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,430
Set.

525
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,870
Isn't that short enough to be underwear?

526
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,010
(Kwang Soo's dirty comment breaks the silence.)

527
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,710
(What's wrong with my shorts?)

528
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,880
- That's a warning.
 -  Are those shorts?

529
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
- No, I was just curious.
 -  That's a warning.

530
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,400
- You need to leave for a minute.
 -  I'm sorry.

531
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,940
(He is timed-out for 1 minute.)

532
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,980
(We have freedom of speech in Korea.)

533
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,400
Do you want to wipe off your sweat?

534
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Ready.

535
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,590
- Set.
 -  He's good.

536
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,260
(This match could go either way.)

537
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,230
(Jong Kook vs Returning Student)

538
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,940
(What will be the result?)

539
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,490
Start.

540
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,670
(The game begins.)

541
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,670
(Jong Kook wins.)

542
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,660
You can't beat him.

543
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,340
- How's your shoulder?
 -  Good job, Jong Kook.

544
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,540
It's too bad but goodbye.

545
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,470
Thank you.

546
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,870
- Thank you.
 -  Next.

547
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,900
- Ready.
 -  She's so cute.

548
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,130
Set.

549
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,490
(Will Jong Kook be a gentleman or pour his energy into winning?)

550
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,540
- You're handsome.
 -  Gosh.

551
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,990
- Thank you.
 -  Don't do that.

552
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,240
Set.

553
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,490
Start.

554
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm sorry.

555
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,740
He finished her.

556
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
(He flashes a smile.)

557
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,400
(While playing against ladies,)

558
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,540
(he shows good manners.)

559
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,050
(However, when he competes against guys,)

560
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,460
(he turns from a nice guy...)

561
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,840
(to a Spartan in a split second.)

562
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,570
(Jong Kook continues to win consecutive matches.)

563
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,450
(He beats 33 people in a row!)

564
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,690
Next.

565
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,090
(Number 38 is next.)

566
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,240
This guy is different.

567
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,300
He has broad shoulders.

568
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,130
(He tries to intimidate Jong Kook by being restless.)

569
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,700
Look at him. He's fast.

570
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,660
- He's swift.
 -  His arms are solid.

571
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,840
You have good pecs.

572
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,330
Your pecs are solid.

573
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,660
(He's muscular.)

574
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,230
I know. You look strong.

575
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,270
Set.

576
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,190
- They're getting physical.
 -  You never know what will happen.

577
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,160
- He's glaring at him.
 -  For Jong Kook,

578
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,730
this is Number 38.

579
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,130
So he has beaten around 35 people.

580
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,190
- Jong Kook must be tired.
 -  Set.

581
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,970
(Jong Kook must be tired after playing 34 rounds.)

582
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,970
(His opponent doesn't look easy.)

583
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,160
(This is a moment of crisis.)

584
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,900
(Will Jong Kook be able to overcome this moment?)

585
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
Start.

586
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,140
(Shrieking)

587
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,660
(He goes down with a yell.)

588
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,630
(What was that for?)

589
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,670
Sorry. It's too bad.

590
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,340
You know...

591
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,390
(You would have thought he's the winner.)

592
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,540
I thought...

593
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,060
Jong Kook lost.

594
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,860
(Shrieking)

595
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,650
Thank you. Good job.

596
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,990
That was definitely comedy.

597
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,160
- He's funny.
 -  That was excellent.

598
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,320
He's the scene stealer.

599
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,440
- That's right.
 -  He tried to tire Jong Kook out.

600
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,490
Look at him.

601
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,770
(Number 42 is good-looking.)

602
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,890
(He's tall and built.)

603
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,960
He's handsome.

604
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,950
What's your major?

605
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,190
You look quite strong.

606
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,790
I'm in the Department of Physical Education.

607
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,200
We finally have somebody from physical education.

608
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,200
What do you major in?

609
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,490
- I'm a Track-and-Field Major.
 -  They're all handsome.

610
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,130
- Do you do track-and-field?
 -  Yes.

611
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,440
Track-and-field is the basic.

612
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,040
(His arms are muscular.)

613
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,290
Jong Kook lost a lot of energy.

614
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,130
- Since Jong Kook...
 -  He arm-wrestled too many times.

615
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,440
arm-wrestled a lot, he's quite exhausted.

616
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,560
- He's exhausted.
 -  This one's unpredictable.

617
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,890
- I'm not sure about this one.
 -  Wow.

618
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,190
He's very handsome.

619
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,260
Get ready.

620
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,490
You never know how this will turn out.

621
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,050
- You can't stop here.
 -  You can do it.

622
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,290
Set.

623
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,130
(Jong Kook's faced with a crisis again.)

624
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,030
(If he loses now, there are 258 students left to compete.)

625
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,830
(Will he overcome this crisis?)

626
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,960
Start.

627
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,740
Look at this. He's strong.

628
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,430
(Jong Kook comes out strong from the start.)

629
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,790
(His opponent is a fair match.)

630
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,470
(What will be the result?)

631
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,440
Look at this. He's sturdy.

632
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,630
Look at that. He's strong.

633
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,840
(It's a match of unparalleled strengths.)

634
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,570
(They start swaying towards Jong Kook's side.)

635
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
(Jong Kook wins.)

636
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,590
Oh, gosh.

637
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,740
(That was a close game.)

638
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,590
You're amazing.

639
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,700
- My goodness.
 -  You did well.

640
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,080
(Jong Kook beats 38 people so far.)

641
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,660
Jong Kook is great but so are the students.

642
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,940
(There are 258 people left.)

643
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,230
This round could be Jong Kook's last.

644
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,330
Start.

645
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,520
(Number 43)

646
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,170
This one's hard. He lost a lot of energy.

647
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,060
Jong Kook is exhausted now.

648
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,740
(Jong Kook is not as fierce as he was in previous rounds.)

649
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,490
It's becoming too much for Jong Kook.

650
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,560
(Jong Kook feels pressured as the strongest member of Running Man.)

651
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,220
Jong Kook, you are starting...

652
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,940
- to get tired.
 -  My arms are sore.

653
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,800
- It's sore.
 -  Shall we continue?

654
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,860
There are four guys in a row.

655
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,360
- This person...
 -  There are four in a row.

656
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,170
- This one looks strong.
 -  He does.

657
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,800
You should watch out for this player.

658
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,230
Set.

659
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,690
(They grasp each other's hands.)

660
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,520
Get ready, Jong Kook.

661
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,890
Give it all you've got.

662
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,070
Set.

663
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,790
(What will be the result?)

664
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,040
- Start.
 -  Good.

665
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,240
(The game starts.)

666
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,670
(It's a close one.)

667
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,140
(He clenches his teeth and pours every ounce of energy he has.)

668
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,170
At last,

669
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,510
will Jong Kook...

670
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,660
(At the 52nd game, he faces his biggest challenge.)

671
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,060
(How will this game turn out?)

672
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,770
After the 52nd game...

673
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,670
(At that moment,)

674
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,740
(Jong Kook's arm begins to sway.)

675
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,560
He's lost all of his energy.

676
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,560
(He lost his energy after 52 matches.)

677
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,260
(His opponent starts to take over.)

678
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,550
(Running Man still has 244 people to beat.)

679
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,030
(Will Jong Kook be able to flip the table?)

680
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,370
Jong Kook has lost all of his energy.

681
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,800
He's lost all of his energy.

682
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,700
(Jong Kook loses!)

683
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,870
(He lost on his 53rd match.)

684
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,270
(He's still incredible.)

685
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,230
(He must have been tired from previous missions as well.)

686
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,640
He's good.

687
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,230
(He beat 52 people in arm-wrestling.)

688
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,440
Good job.

689
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,960
Jong Kook...

690
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
was defeated by his 53rd opponent.

691
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,930
- That was a lot.
 -  The students here...

692
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,040
- were great.
 -  That's incredible.

693
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,280
Jong Kook was also incredible.

694
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,840
Please give them a round of applause.

695
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,530
(There are 244 people left.)

696
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,630
This one's unpredictable.

697
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,860
You never know what will happen.

698
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,830
Except for three of them up there,

699
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,140
Jong Kook has sent everyone else up there.

700
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,840
- I'm sorry.
 -  Next.

701
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,960
That was incredible to watch.

702
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,560
All right, let's continue.

703
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,430
- Following Jong Kook,
 -  Who is it?

704
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,460
let's see who the next person is.

705
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,670
I'm nervous.

706
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,170
(Who will it be?)

707
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,390
I hope it's not me. Gary?

708
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,400
It's Gary and Ji Hyo.

709
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,160
Are they playing together?

710
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,740
- They'll be playing...
 -  It must be 2 on 2.

711
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,640
the Couple Game. You were right.

712
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,570
What game is it exactly?

713
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,240
Gary and Ji Hyo will form an airplane as a team.

714
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,080
One person will lie down and hold their partner up with their feet.

715
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,310
At the sound of the whistle, you must...

716
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,590
- bend your legs up and down.
 -  I know this game.

717
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,630
- This one's a hard one.
 -  This game?

718
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,390
Then we might have a bunch of people dropping out.

719
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,630
The person next to you is your partner.

720
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,700
You have to do well.

721
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,060
You can decide who will hold the other person up.

722
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,430
There are too many majoring in sports.

723
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,050
- You're right.
 -  You can look at it this way.

724
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,190
There might be a lot of people dropping out in this game.

725
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,930
- This is good.
 -  Gary has a strong will. He's good.

726
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,170
For the Couple Game, let's bring out Ji Hyo and Gary!

727
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,290
(It's Ji Hyo and Gary's turn.)

728
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,530
(If we were to talk about these two...)

729
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,730
This is the power of love.

730
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,930
(Having worked together for years, they have the best harmony.)

731
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,230
(They have mastered all couple games.)

732
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,570
(Ji Hyo and Gary are the best couple of Running Man.)

733
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,200
- We will begin now.
 -  This is a conquest.

734
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,190
- According to my whistle,
 -  Let's do this!

735
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,140
- stretch and fold your legs.
 -  You stop when you're tired.

736
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,970
- It's going to be quite tough.
 -  Are you all ready?

737
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,290
- Let's do this!
 -  Here we begin.

738
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,990
- Cheers, everybody!
 -  Let's go!

739
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,220
Start.

740
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,870
(The game begins.)

741
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,260
(Everyone starts flying.)

742
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,470
(From the start, people are screaming here and there.)

743
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,590
(Struggling)

744
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,100
- Many people are dropping out.
 -  Wow.

745
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,000
(Go slowly.)

746
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,270
(10 teams are already out.)

747
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,690
(Lifting)

748
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,660
It's easier to hold them without having to move.

749
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,770
(They encourage each other with their eyes.)

750
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,430
(The screams become louder.)

751
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,300
A bunch of teams got eliminated again.

752
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,700
(He's tired, too.)

753
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,630
- Many teams failed.
 -  Many teams are dropping out.

754
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,100
(After about 10 times, many couples begin to drop out.)

755
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,670
Slowly.

756
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,430
(This is my limit.)

757
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,440
Will they all drop out like this?

758
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,390
- It seems like they'll all fail.
 -  I'm too tired!

759
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,040
(Female couple are panicking, too.)

760
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,740
(All of the couples except for 30 of them are down.)

761
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,230
- Doesn't your stomach hurt?
 -  It's okay.

762
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,160
Gary is too strong.

763
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,900
- He's too good.
 -  It's one of Gary's strengths.

764
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,090
About 50 people are remaining.

765
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,330
To get the result faster,

766
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,660
I will speed up the whistling.

767
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,200
(25 couples remain. The speed is increased.)

768
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,800
(More than 75 teams have already been eliminated.)

769
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,870
Gary is amazing.

770
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,340
Good job.

771
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,440
(We can do well, right?)

772
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,860
- A lot of couples failed.
 -  This is crazy.

773
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,900
(The young couples are as good as Gary and Ji Hyo.)

774
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,660
(The whistling gets faster.)

775
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,740
They are a male couple and they are still going.

776
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,170
His legs are really strong.

777
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,300
If you're about to give up, let us know.

778
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,860
Gary is struggling, too.

779
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,780
Gary is struggling a lot, too. Ji Hyo is struggling as well.

780
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,370
- Your stomach hurts, doesn't it?
 -  Yes.

781
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,390
What do we do?

782
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,870
- I'm okay.
 -  Please cheer for the participants!

783
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,440
(The gym is filled with burning passion.)

784
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,460
(Cries of desperation)

785
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,970
We are almost there.

786
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,240
I hate you, Gary!

787
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,560
Gary!

788
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,490
- Stop, Gary!
 -  Give up!

789
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,590
(Gary is everyone's enemy.)

790
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,960
The ones on top and the ones supporting...

791
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,260
- on the bottom are...
 -  Number 120 is almost out.

792
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,570
- Number 120 is finally out.
 -  Number 120 is out!

793
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,760
(They're like falling leaves.)

794
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
I can't believe it.

795
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,090
(Many couples are getting eliminated.)

796
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,740
- Their stomachs must hurt.
 -  It's difficult.

797
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,500
(Throwing)

798
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,990
(Only 15 couples remain!)

799
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,830
- They are both men.
 -  Seok Jin!

800
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,260
- They're unbelievable.
 -  A male couple is still going.

801
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,500
- They are truly amazing.
 -  Tighten your stomach.

802
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,080
(This is the definition of "bromance".)

803
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,990
Those girls are still going, too!

804
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,720
- Now...
 -  Where?

805
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,590
There is a female couple that is still going.

806
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,370
They are both girls.

807
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,860
Only the tough ones are left.

808
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,730
The ones still surviving are unbelievable.

809
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,560
(Their passion is touching.)

810
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,430
It's hard to be on the top, too.

811
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,000
- Is that so?
 -  Really.

812
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,240
It's also hard to be on top.

813
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,770
(Many couples reach their limit and get eliminated.)

814
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,130
I can't do it any more.

815
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,400
(He can't take it any more.)

816
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,420
Stop, Gary!

817
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,630
(They urge Gary to stop.)

818
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,190
Please give them a big hand!

819
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,340
(Yonsei University students' passion and spirit are praise-worthy!)

820
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,730
- They're all amazing.
 -  They really are.

821
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,170
(Gary just looks ugly.)

822
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,550
Gary is about to lose it. He's almost done.

823
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,630
(Hold on just a little more.)

824
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,540
The male couple is still going.

825
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,570
The female couple is also still going.

826
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,170
Let's go!

827
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,090
Come on, guys!

828
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,660
- Come on!
 -  They are amazing.

829
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,000
It's even tiring for me to keep blowing the whistle.

830
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,320
The ones who still remain are truly amazing.

831
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,870
- All right! This is the last part.
 -  They're amazing.

832
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,190
Let's do just 20 more reps.

833
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,530
(The game will end after 20 reps.)

834
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,040
All the couples that manage to survive will be considered winners.

835
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,150
One!

836
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,360
(The 8 couples start the countdown!)

837
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,550
Two!

838
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,790
(Two)

839
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,890
- Three!
 -  Three!

840
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,130
(Three)

841
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,340
- Four!
 -  Four!

842
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,370
- Five!
 -  Five!

843
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,400
- Six!
 -  Six!

844
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,700
- Seven!
 -  Seven!

845
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,740
- Eight!
 -  Eight!

846
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,570
- Nine!
 -  Nine!

847
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,330
- 10!
 -  10! Just give up!

848
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,940
This is crazy.

849
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,990
What's this for? Stop it!

850
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,290
(It's strangely emotional.)

851
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,460
- 14!
 -  They are too good.

852
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,600
- 15!
 -  15!

853
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,400
- 16!
 -  16!

854
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,470
- 17!
 -  17!

855
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,440
- 18!
 -  18!

856
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,370
- 19!
 -  19!

857
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,840
(One more and it's all over.)

858
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,330
(Meeting for the first time, they were awkward at first.)

859
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,470
(But after playing the games together, they became friends.)

860
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,830
- 19!
 -  19!

861
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,870
(They've completed 19 reps.)

862
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,870
Success!

863
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:08,090
(No teams dropped out.)

864
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,870
(All 8 teams succeeded.)

865
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,170
(We did it!)

866
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,900
You did it! You really did it!

867
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,540
- Put them down.
 -  You can put them down now.

868
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,690
- They are exhausted.
 -  They are truly amazing.

869
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,140
(They are proud of themselves and thankful to each other.)

870
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,360
They are truly amazing.

871
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,900
Good job. Good job.

872
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,760
- You can come down now.
 -  Put them down.

873
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,390
(With their youth and fighting spirit,)

874
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,730
(they finished a mission that they had never done before.)

875
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,430
Good job.

876
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,590
You're done.

877
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,760
(At first, they came to beat each other.)

878
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,810
- You can come down now.
 -  Good job.

879
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,020
- It was the best.
 -  They are really amazing.

880
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
- Ji Hyo.
 -  Good job.

881
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,100
- That was amazing.
 -  Good job.

882
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,490
- It was touching.
 -  It really was.

883
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,040
All right. Gary and Ji Hyo couple...

884
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,370
and the last eight couples did their best.

885
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,500
Please give it up for them!

886
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,770
(182 people got eliminated and 63 people survived.)

887
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,420
Now,

888
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,590
(The competition is in the middle stage.)

889
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,860
Seven Running Man members...

890
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,070
are competing against 300 Yonsei University students.

891
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,030
Three Running Man members are still remaining.

892
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,360
Who will be the next contender? Please reveal it.

893
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,830
(Who is the next contender?)

894
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,190
It's Seok Jin.

895
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,860
- You can do it.
 -  Be serious.

896
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,240
You have to do this one.

897
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,090
- It's nothing.
 -  You're good at this.

898
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,300
- All right.
 -  Let's go!

899
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,910
- Come on!
 -  Let's see what the game is.

900
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,560
- What is it?
 -  Is it rock-paper-scissors?

901
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,540
(What will Seok Jin play against 63 people?)

902
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,140
(Their hearts are beating.)

903
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,200
(What will Seok Jin have to play against 63 students?)

904
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,190
It's rock-paper-scissors.

905
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,040
(Tricky Rock-Paper-Scissors)

906
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,250
- What's Tricky Rock-Paper-Scissors?
 -  You say what you'll put out.

907
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,270
I will say what I will give first and then play the game.

908
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,990
I will first say what I will give.

909
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,080
Whether I stick to it or not is up to me.

910
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,660
Seok Jin is the member who is the best at this game.

911
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,900
That's true.

912
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,890
(Seok Jin has proved to be the king of rock-paper-scissors.)

913
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,560
(He stood out for his brilliant ability. How will he do today?)

914
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,660
Number 71, please come on out.

915
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,890
All right.

916
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,530
(Number 71 takes the mound.)

917
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,040
Please stand here.

918
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,230
Can you ask him what his major is? I think it will help me.

919
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,310
- Industrial Engineering.
 -  Industrial Engineering?

920
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,560
- You must be good at math.
 -  We will begin now.

921
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
- Let's start it. Seok Jin?
 -  Yes.

922
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,440
I will give scissors.

923
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,190
I've been playing rock-paper-scissors for a long time,

924
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,020
and 98 percent of the time, I give scissors.

925
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,070
- He's telling the truth.
 -  Ready. We will start now.

926
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,930
You can play the game when I give the sign.

927
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,990
Will Seok Jin fail from the start?

928
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,460
Or will he continue his legacy?

929
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,860
Seok Jin is really good at this.

930
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,190
Seok Jin said he will...

931
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,890
- give scissors.
 -  Yes.

932
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,930
- Okay. Here we go.
 -  I will really stick to it.

933
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,370
What did the opponent say he'll give?

934
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,730
(Seok Jin's weapons are his one hand and his words.)

935
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,240
(Are they enough to beat 63 people?)

936
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,470
Rock-paper-scissors!

937
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,690
(What?)

938
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,260
(Seok Jin loses.)

939
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,360
(Number 71 wins on the first round.)

940
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,440
(No...)

941
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,630
(Seok Jin, this isn't right.)

942
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,300
He lost.

943
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,670
(Seok Jin, this isn't right.)

944
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,370
(Bye, Seok Jin.)

945
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,300
(Seok Jin is undeniably an unlucky man.)

946
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,900
- It's his first loss of the year.
 -  Seok Jin.

947
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,600
Seok Jin, you are out.

948
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,300
I can't believe you lost.

949
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,360
- How did...
 -  It's your first loss.

950
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,870
He said he will put out scissors. Why did you go with scissors?

951
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,530
If he puts out scissors, at least we could play once more.

952
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,200
- That's why you went with scissors.
 -  Right.

953
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,630
Seok Jin, please go back to your place.

954
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,760
It's okay. We still have players.

955
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,190
- We still have two players.
 -  Okay.

956
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,500
Kwang Soo and...

957
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,900
Haha still remain.

958
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,130
- Gosh.
 -  We still...

959
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,330
don't know what will happen.

960
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,680
- Who's playing next?
 -  Next!

961
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,980
- I think you'll play basketball.
 -  No.

962
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,930
Please reveal the next player.

963
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,090
(Who will play next?)

964
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,330
- Haha.
 -  It's Haha.

965
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,190
(It's Haha, the most mischievous player.)

966
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,390
He said there's something at the end.

967
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,200
Let's check what game they will be playing.

968
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,940
Please show it to us.

969
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,400
(Everyone is focused.)

970
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,460
(What's Haha's game?)

971
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,530
Towel Snatch.

972
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,700
(It's Towel Snatch.)

973
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,300
- Towel Snatch.
 -  What's that?

974
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,370
(This is my game.)

975
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,830
You never expected this, did you?

976
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,300
(Haha is the king of tricks.)

977
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,100
(He's talented at snatching things.)

978
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,040
- He will be good at it.
 -  We never know.

979
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,660
(It's 2 versus 63 now. Yonsei University is leading.)

980
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,870
Please cheer for the two players!

981
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,390
Bravo!

982
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,640
(Who will snatch and who will get snatched?)

983
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,040
If Haha loses on the first round again,

984
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,080
Team Running Man will be in trouble.

985
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,670
Seok Jin, the king of rock-paper-scissors,

986
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,580
lost on the first round.

987
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,430
He said he had a 98 percent chance of winning.

988
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,840
(His crushing defeat is unbelievable.)

989
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,970
(Will Haha be able to make up for Seok Jin's loss?)

990
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,730
(There is tension between them.)

991
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,800
(Haha wins as soon as the game begins.)

992
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,550
(He was helpless.)

993
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,730
I knew it.

994
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,460
(Hey, this is me.)

995
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,590
He's fast.

996
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,470
- His legs are short.
 -  He's really fast.

997
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,560
Next.

998
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
Number 72.

999
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,360
- He is...
 -  You did well.

1000
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,520
Look behind you.

1001
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,640
Let's go.

1002
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,470
Haha has to...

1003
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,890
(Did he just hit me?)

1004
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,310
Haha has to win several rounds.

1005
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,200
(Grabbing)

1006
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,660
Okay.

1007
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,670
(After the impressive greeting, they are ready to play.)

1008
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,040
You two are going down too far.

1009
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,330
- You were...
 -  He did it, too!

1010
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,330
What's the purpose of playing the game if they do that?

1011
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,360
(He is a cheater just like Haha.)

1012
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,560
Get ready.

1013
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
(They will play a fair game.)

1014
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,740
(Nervous)

1015
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,220
(Number 72 wins as soon as the game starts.)

1016
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,000
(Even Haha has failed.)

1017
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
He lost.

1018
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,810
Now...

1019
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,560
It's too bad.

1020
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,870
Even Haha lost.

1021
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,600
Now,

1022
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,500
it's too tricky.

1023
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,330
Kwang Soo is the only one surviving.

1024
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,810
(Kwang Soo must fight 62 people alone.)

1025
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
The game Kwang Soo will play is...

1026
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,940
(What game will Kwang Soo play against 62 people?)

1027
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,090
Quail Egg Hit-and-Miss.

1028
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,830
(Quail Egg Hit-and-Miss)

1029
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,930
I know that.

1030
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,060
(That one?)

1031
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,620
All right. Great.

1032
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,450
Everyone will be given an option of two eggs.

1033
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,440
And you will only choose one.

1034
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,460
The same goes for Kwang Soo.

1035
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,600
On the count of three,

1036
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,110
you will smash the egg on your forehead.

1037
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,140
If you get the raw egg, you pass.

1038
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,570
If you get the boiled egg, you fail.

1039
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,300
Understood?

1040
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,690
Yes, but I'm very pressured.

1041
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,840
- All right!
 -  I'm the last one.

1042
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,820
Kwang Soo and everyone,

1043
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,340
please choose a quail egg.

1044
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,370
Oh my goodness.

1045
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,660
(Quail Egg Hit-and-Miss begins.)

1046
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,890
Please choose one.

1047
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,670
Choose only one.

1048
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,830
I'm scared.

1049
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,690
(This game can eliminate many people at once.)

1050
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,340
- I think I know what it is.
 -  It's raw.

1051
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,420
Please choose one.

1052
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,530
On our forehead?

1053
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,140
- On our forehead.
 -  Okay.

1054
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,410
(They are extremely focused.)

1055
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,570
Take some tissues.

1056
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,490
Now!

1057
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,630
(It could be the last round.)

1058
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,890
This could be the last round.

1059
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,460
- Kwang Soo...
 -  Yes.

1060
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,330
will play Quail Egg Hit-and-Miss...

1061
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,200
- with the remaining students.
 -  Please!

1062
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,000
He's known to be the member who doesn't have any luck.

1063
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,560
He's the unluckiest man ever.

1064
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,630
(He's the unluckiest member.)

1065
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,130
Kwang Soo will now choose a quail egg.

1066
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,390
Please choose one.

1067
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,340
(Will there be a miracle?)

1068
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,330
(Previously, Kwang Soo beat the odds and failed miserably.)

1069
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,990
(Every choice he made was bad during the Unluckiest Man Special.)

1070
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,030
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Gosh.

1071
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,960
(He's the man who is loved by raw eggs and Mr Barrel.)

1072
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,340
(Here comes Mr Unlucky.)

1073
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,530
- If he chooses a boiled egg.
 -  If he chooses the wrong one.

1074
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,130
- Our fate depends on...
 -  Don't think too much.

1075
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,020
That makes you unlucky.

1076
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,390
- Just trust your instinct.
 -  Just be yourself.

1077
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,280
- Of course.
 -  It will be funny either way.

1078
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,720
Regardless of how many people pick raw eggs,

1079
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,220
the moment Kwang Soo chooses the boiled egg,

1080
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
- the game will end.
 -  Yes.

1081
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,000
Today, 7 vs 300 will end with...

1082
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,570
Team Running Man's defeat.

1083
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,830
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes.

1084
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,210
Please choose one.

1085
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,270
Ready.

1086
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,040
Close your eyes and choose one.

1087
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,060
- Feel it.
 -  Today...

1088
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,330
- That's it.
 -  No, you already touched it.

1089
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,690
- You only get one chance to choose.
 -  You touched it.

1090
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,010
- He chose one.
 -  It ends when he picks one.

1091
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,640
It finally begins.

1092
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,540
- Everyone.
 -  I'm curious.

1093
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,240
Some of you are going to smash it on each other's foreheads.

1094
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,930
- Okay.
 -  Let's go.

1095
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,090
Don't hesitate.

1096
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,140
You shouldn't hesitate.

1097
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,630
One!

1098
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,340
(One)

1099
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,790
(Please...)

1100
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,030
Two!

1101
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,030
(Two)

1102
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:57,040
(He is the icon of misfortune. Did he choose the raw egg?)

1103
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,830
Please cheer for him.

1104
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,040
(Jae Seok interrupts.)

1105
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,560
(How dare you, Jae Seok!)

1106
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,780
Let's do this!

1107
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,260
(Everyone's heart is racing.)

1108
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,600
- All right, Kwang Soo.
 -  Ready.

1109
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,110
One!

1110
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,400
(One)

1111
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,200
(Please let it be like how it always has been.)

1112
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,330
Two!

1113
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,500
(Two)

1114
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,460
(Will he be able to beat 62 people with his misfortune?)

1115
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,740
One, two, three!

1116
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,500
(Here we go.)

1117
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,340
Three!

1118
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,000
(It breaks.)

1119
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,600
(He got the raw quail egg.)

1120
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,800
(It's party time!)

1121
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,760
So we won.

1122
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,890
- We won.
 -  Kwang Soo won.

1123
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,050
- We won.
 -  You won.

1124
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,750
If you got the raw egg, please stay seated.

1125
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,270
If you got the boiled egg, please stand up.

1126
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,400
- Thank you.
 -  Many people got eliminated.

1127
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,790
- I knew it.
 -  Kwang Soo...

1128
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,060
- is amazing.
 -  I did it!

1129
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,730
Kwang Soo did it.

1130
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,140
- Kwang Soo did it.
 -  Just once more!

1131
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,040
This is amazing.

1132
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
There were...

1133
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,770
two eggs, so there was a 50 percent chance.

1134
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:23,150
Kwang Soo did it!

1135
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,770
- You're amazing!
 -  Bravo!

1136
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,890
He did something really difficult.

1137
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,460
- He did something really difficult.
 -  Yes.

1138
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,640
Now,

1139
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,660
- the ones remaining here...
 -  They are also amazing.

1140
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,160
also chose the raw eggs.

1141
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,040
- They are amazing people.
 -  All right.

1142
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,240
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes.

1143
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,970
Did you have the gut feeling?

1144
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,340
I thought of the first round as a warm-up exercise.

1145
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,540
Now, not too many people are surviving.

1146
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,830
We will play the game one more time.

1147
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,610
Please choose your quail eggs!

1148
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,040
- They are very serious.
 -  They are.

1149
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,000
How many people are remaining?

1150
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,460
25 people are remaining.

1151
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,170
(If Kwang Soo chooses the boiled one, Running Man loses.)

1152
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,370
- Don't think too much, Kwang Soo.
 -  Maybe he'll choose the boiled egg.

1153
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,230
- You may choose when they're done.
 -  Okay.

1154
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,540
Will there be...

1155
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,000
another miracle?

1156
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,790
- Please choose an egg.
 -  Follow your gut feeling.

1157
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,090
Don't try to do well. Please.

1158
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,260
(Just be yourself.)

1159
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,790
- Wow.
 -  He looks cool.

1160
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,830
He chose his.

1161
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:24,940
He did it.

1162
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,870
He chose his second quail egg.

1163
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,490
(What will happen this time?)

1164
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,730
One!

1165
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,080
(One)

1166
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,860
(Will 7 vs 300 end here?)

1167
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,160
- Please.
 -  Two!

1168
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,390
(Two)

1169
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,500
Please.

1170
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:46,100
(The result of this game depends on Kwang Soo.)

1171
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,290
Three!

1172
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,500
(The egg breaks.)

1173
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,200
(He chose the raw egg once again.)

1174
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,300
(They won't lose to him.)

1175
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,890
(Yes!)

1176
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,090
He's amazing.

1177
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,340
Kwang Soo is amazing.

1178
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,430
Those who survived are also amazing.

1179
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,680
(Many people failed.)

1180
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,820
- Now...
 -  The egg flew to the back.

1181
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,600
- Go, Kwang Soo!
 -  I can't do this.

1182
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,430
- It flew to the back.
 -  You did it.

1183
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,470
(He's proud.)

1184
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,840
Half of you got eliminated.

1185
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,000
14 people remain.

1186
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,880
Kwang Soo,

1187
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,200
you did it again. Was it expected?

1188
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,440
Well, I just did it...

1189
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,030
like I always do.

1190
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,320
- Yes.
 -  Okay.

1191
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,830
You thought it was no big deal.

1192
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,190
Actually, the ones surviving here...

1193
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,870
are very unlucky. It's not easy to choose raw eggs twice in a row.

1194
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,360
That's really unlucky.

1195
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,620
We will begin the third round.

1196
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,760
The students have all picked their eggs.

1197
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,390
Now, it's the third round.

1198
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,500
All right, Kwang Soo.

1199
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,360
If you do it again, I will acknowledge you.

1200
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,830
If he succeeds again...

1201
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,980
He's already done great so far.

1202
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,690
- Even two in a row is hard.
 -  It's hard to get.

1203
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,590
It's really difficult for Kwang Soo...

1204
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,070
- even though he's really unlucky.
 -  That's right.

1205
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,060
- I'll do this comfortably.
 -  Okay.

1206
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,320
Five, four, three, two, one.

1207
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,460
- That's it.
 -  He made a different choice.

1208
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,940
- He went from left to right.
 -  That one looks good.

1209
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,740
One!

1210
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,730
(What will be the result of his choice?)

1211
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,140
Two!

1212
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,500
Kwang Soo.

1213
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,000
Go, Kwang Soo.

1214
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,870
Please be quiet.

1215
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,160
- Look.
 -  He's really sensitive.

1216
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,040
- I'm trying to focus.
 -  He's really sensitive right now.

1217
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,590
I'm sorry. I feel really nervous right now.

1218
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,760
(Please keep quiet during the match.)

1219
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,470
(This is the turning point of the game.)

1220
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,730
(There's a 1 out of 8 chance. Can Kwang Soo make it?)

1221
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,940
Two!

1222
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,880
(There were 300 opponents, but now only 14 remain.)

1223
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,930
Three!

1224
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,440
(Crushing)

1225
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,670
(The raw quail egg returns.)

1226
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,390
(It's not easy to pick the raw egg 3 times in a row.)

1227
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,990
(But it's nothing special to unlucky Kwang Soo.)

1228
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,390
(Kwang Soo is unlucky, and unlucky is the word to describe Kwang Soo.)

1229
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,060
- That's amazing.
 -  It's unbelievable.

1230
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,640
(Everyone, cheer for Kwang Soo!)

1231
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,660
- This is...
 -  Wow.

1232
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,930
(He beat the small chance of 1 out of 8.)

1233
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,110
No way.

1234
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,630
This is amazing.

1235
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,860
(His skills give you goosebumps.)

1236
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,930
There are only a few people left.

1237
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,770
We have been close friends for several years now.

1238
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,240
But I'm really surprised.

1239
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,090
Kwang Soo is amazing. But at the same time, all the survivors...

1240
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,660
out here are amazing, too.

1241
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,530
Now, there are only seven survivors left.

1242
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,760
- Number 72 is really great.
 -  He really is.

1243
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,260
He survived since he played against Gary and Ji Hyo.

1244
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,090
- He is really amazing.
 -  He's the real survivor.

1245
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,230
- He's incredible.
 -  All right.

1246
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,190
- Let's continue.
 -  What are the odds now?

1247
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,270
All right.

1248
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,460
Please choose your eggs.

1249
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,790
I think about two people will survive this time.

1250
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,930
If Kwang Soo is the only one to break the raw egg...

1251
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,790
- and survive, it'll be amazing.
 -  Kwang Soo will choose his egg.

1252
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,860
(It's more like an occult show now.)

1253
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,900
Please choose your egg for this round.

1254
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,870
- My goodness.
 -  Do it, Kwang Soo.

1255
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,940
- You're amazing.
 -  We can win this.

1256
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,050
Don't think for too long. Your initial choice must be right.

1257
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,330
(Kwang Soo chooses the egg on the left this time.)

1258
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,900
- Now...
 -  He's really serious about this.

1259
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,700
I'll count to three. Is everyone ready?

1260
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,190
One!

1261
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,600
(One!)

1262
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,820
- Two!
 -  It must be the raw egg.

1263
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,790
(There are only 7 survivors and the chance is 1 out of 16.)

1264
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:34,940
You'll make it.

1265
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,020
You're amazing already.

1266
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,170
Three!

1267
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,400
(Please...)

1268
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,140
Three!

1269
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,340
(Coming soon)

1270
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,790
(It isn't over until it's over.)

1271
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,030
Is it up there?

1272
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,430
(Mysterious hunters have come with the darkness.)

1273
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,290
What's going on? Oh, gosh.

1274
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,370
What is that?

1275
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,870
(The final mission of the 300th episode special will begin shortly.)

1276
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,670
Three!

1277
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,840
(Please...)

1278
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,770
Three!

1279
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,040
(Hitting)

1280
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,700
(He got the boiled egg this time.)

1281
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,660
This must be the raw egg.

1282
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,580
Wait. Among all of you,

1283
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,990
did anyone get the raw egg?

1284
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,430
(Is there anyone who got the raw egg?)

1285
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:33,340
(If there's none, Kwang Soo will have a rematch against them.)

1286
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,130
- Is there one?
 -  Two?

1287
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,770
(2 students survived.)

1288
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,960
So it turns out that...

1289
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,560
the Team 300 from Yonsei University has won!

1290
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,630
(The final result: Team 300 from Yonsei University wins)

1291
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,230
- Only two survivors were left.
 -  It was really close.

1292
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,790
- It was really amazing.
 -  It was so close.

1293
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,460
- Yes, it was close.
 -  If we had more luck...

1294
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,060
- If Kwang Soo picked the raw egg...
 -  If Kwang Soo had passed,

1295
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,160
- then he could play...
 -  For the last time.

1296
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,950
- once more against two students.
 -  It was so close.

1297
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,390
Please applaud for everyone who participated and did their best!

1298
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,540
(We thank the 300 students who did their best.)

1299
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,430
You did well. Good job.

1300
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,100
- Well done.
 -  It was a good game.

1301
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,470
- Thank you.
 -  It was a nice game.

1302
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,260
Today, we'd like to show our gratitude for your warm welcome...

1303
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,560
and for spending time with us until this late.

1304
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,830
We're really grateful. Thank you, everyone!

1305
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,030
(Thank you once again.)

1306
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,240
Akaraka!

1307
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,100
(But no one was aware of what awaited them.)

1308
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,860
(After the long mission, they are headed somewhere.)

1309
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,570
- I'm starving.
 -  I feel hungry, too.

1310
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,990
(It's too late even for a night-time supper. Where are they heading now?)

1311
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,260
(They're somewhere in Gyeonggi-do, far away from Seoul.)

1312
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,040
- Where are we?
 -  It's scary.

1313
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,900
Goodness. How far are we travelling?

1314
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,140
We're deep in the heart of the mountains. What will we do here?

1315
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,360
(Only the Running Man members' car is moving in the mountains.)

1316
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,030
(They drive through rough and narrow roads to get there.)

1317
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,740
How far are we going? I guess we just arrived.

1318
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,630
(V Pension in Yangpyeong.)

1319
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,230
This pension seems...

1320
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,600
eerie.

1321
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,200
That's for pillow fights.

1322
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,190
We'll be pillow fighting here.

1323
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:25,930
(Will they pillow fight in the heart of the mountains?)

1324
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,720
(What will happen here?)

1325
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,600
- You've played well so far.
 -  Hello.

1326
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,440
Behind you,

1327
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,890
- we've prepared some ramyeon.
 -  Oh, yes!

1328
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,490
(You worked hard, so eat harder.)

1329
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,030
Ramyeon is a perfect snack right now.

1330
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,770
- Right now.
 -  While we boil the water,

1331
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,270
you will play a simple pillow fight.

1332
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,540
We will rank you according to the result of this game.

1333
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,670
And you will receive a bonus for the final mission...

1334
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,900
according to your ranks.

1335
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,790
- There's something.
 -  There must be something.

1336
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,970
You'll find out after watching the introduction video.

1337
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,430
(Pillow Fight Tournament Table)

1338
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,460
You must do your best for this.

1339
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,460
- Ji Hyo can't win this match.
 -  I think she'll lose immediately.

1340
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,930
Ji Hyo, don't think you can't make this fight.

1341
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,630
He probably can't use his right arm because of arm wrestling.

1342
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,130
- Ji Hyo, you can do this.
 -  Ready,

1343
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,940
set, go.

1344
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:27,290
(Ji Hyo versus Jong Kook)

1345
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,260
- Go.
 -  Ji Hyo, smash him.

1346
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,090
(Okay, I'll give it a try.)

1347
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,600
(Take this.)

1348
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,760
(Smashing)

1349
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,260
- He's serious.
 -  That was harsh.

1350
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,390
- My gosh.
 -  Jong Kook is merciless.

1351
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,540
- Jong Kook.
 -  That was really harsh.

1352
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,790
- Calm down, Ji Hyo.
 -  Jong Kook is a man.

1353
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,930
Jong Kook.

1354
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,160
- He changed his concept.
 -  Did that hurt?

1355
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,590
- He's a better guy now.
 -  He's nice.

1356
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,840
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
 -  It's a match between Haha and me.

1357
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,430
Viewer discretion is advised for the children and elderly.

1358
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,790
- You're fine with this, aren't you?
 -  Of course, I am.

1359
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,190
You're both dirty fighters.

1360
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,460
Why don't you hit each other once, first?

1361
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,530
- Hit each other once.
 -  Let's go.

1362
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,690
- Go ahead.
 -  I don't have any hard feelings.

1363
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,860
- Of course.
 -  Hit each other.

1364
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,200
- I'll hit first.
 -  Okay.

1365
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,870
(Whacking)

1366
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,420
Your face got stiff, Jae Seok.

1367
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,260
- Don't get mad.
 -  I'm totally fine.

1368
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,580
- My turn?
 -  Yes.

1369
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,830
(What? Did you dodge?)

1370
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,900
(Didn't we agree to hit each other once?)

1371
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,090
(Look at the mess they're in.)

1372
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,590
He's always a betrayer.

1373
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,760
- That's right.
 -  I saw that coming.

1374
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,490
(You're so deceitful.)

1375
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,970
(Jae Seok unleashes his fury.)

1376
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,010
(Heavy smashing)

1377
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,640
(Goodness. What are they doing?)

1378
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,650
Hey, you shouldn't...

1379
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,910
I can't defend it. I can't.

1380
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,470
Isn't there a player protection policy?

1381
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,530
Why are you two hitting that spot?

1382
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,840
Protect the players.

1383
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
The second...

1384
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,570
(Jackpot)

1385
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,400
- Why are they...
 -  He fell down.

1386
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,960
Why are you two so serious?

1387
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,640
- He hit the exact spot.
 -  Haha won.

1388
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,370
That nasty Haha.

1389
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,700
(The 3rd match: Jong Kook versus Haha)

1390
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,190
- My left arm hurts, too.
 -  I'm lucky. I will be in fourth.

1391
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,270
- I secured the fourth spot.
 -  That sounds nice.

1392
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:23,200
Ready, set, go.

1393
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,870
You arm-wrestled against 50 people. You can't use your arm.

1394
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,360
(He makes a full swing.)

1395
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,670
Was it that arm?

1396
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,190
(Don't cheat when you play, little kid.)

1397
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,430
(Haha gets thrown onto the ground.)

1398
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,130
(You deserve it, Haha.)

1399
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,420
- It's over.
 -  Gosh.

1400
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,930
(Jong Kook wins.)

1401
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,260
This is the grand final between Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

1402
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,330
(The final round: Jong Kook vs Kwang Soo)

1403
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,700
Where are my glasses?

1404
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,110
Hey, Jong Kook. He's really strong.

1405
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,830
- Yes and he has long arms.
 -  He hits really well with his arms.

1406
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,890
It's the final round.

1407
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,290
I'm looking forward to this.

1408
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,630
I can't guess the result.

1409
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,440
Ready, start.

1410
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,240
- Come on, don't give me that look.
 -  What's the problem?

1411
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,240
Kwang Soo...

1412
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,740
has long arms, so he can reach further.

1413
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,890
(Kwang Soo boldly hits first, and they exchange hits right after.)

1414
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,490
(Kwang Soo fights head-on against Jong Kook.)

1415
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,590
(I'm different now.)

1416
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:25,190
(Smashing)

1417
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:27,060
(He's stunned.)

1418
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,360
(Jackpot)

1419
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,430
(He's shocked and horrified.)

1420
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,680
Wait. Wait. Please wait, I was really shocked.

1421
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,820
Hold on. Did you put something in your pillow?

1422
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,680
I was hit so hard. I'm really shocked.

1423
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,060
- His pillow must be different.
 -  Give me a second.

1424
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,170
This is funny.

1425
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,070
(Focus, Kwang Soo.)

1426
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,270
(He fails to hit and fails to defend.)

1427
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,470
Hey, Kwang Soo. Did your neck shrink?

1428
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,190
You look like a mole right now.

1429
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,300
You can't block anything.

1430
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,530
(He was so full of confidence just a while back.)

1431
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,490
He's helpless.

1432
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,830
(He tries to hold on but fails.)

1433
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,200
- Gosh!
 -  What was that?

1434
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,990
What just happened?

1435
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,200
Can you blur this part out?

1436
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,490
Does this even make sense?

1437
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,090
- Kwang Soo.
 -  My legs are shaking.

1438
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,940
You should have stopped him earlier.

1439
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,330
- This is impossible.
 -  Gosh.

1440
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,970
- This is impossible.
 -  I saw it.

1441
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,530
Jong Kook is the winner.

1442
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,230
This isn't fun at all.

1443
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,170
- It was as expected.
 -  My goodness.

1444
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,490
- Let's eat.
 -  Go on and eat.

1445
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,500
I love ramyeon.

1446
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,190
Thank you for the food.

1447
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,460
Thank you for the food. Enjoy your meal.

1448
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,690
Enjoy your meal.

1449
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,030
(Slurping)

1450
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,340
(Gulping down)

1451
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,430
(Ramyeon and kimchi are perfect together.)

1452
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,770
- Thank you.
 -  There's a lot.

1453
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,950
(It tastes even better after doing physical activities.)

1454
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,550
(By the way, are we allowed to be this happy?)

1455
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,740
This is so tasty.

1456
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,390
(After having dinner,)

1457
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:55,040
(they are assigned rooms according to the results of the pillow fight.)

1458
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,200
(They're all alone.)

1459
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,220
(What's here?)

1460
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,840
There are name tags.

1461
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,660
(They weren't given any explanations about this.)

1462
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,000
(Haha)

1463
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,460
(They head to bed feeling anxious.)

1464
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,640
I'm exhausted.

1465
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,240
(The night has come.)

1466
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,960
(Everything...)

1467
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,890
(is hushed...)

1468
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:39,240
(in darkness.)

1469
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:45,700
(A siren breaks the silence.)

1470
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,270
What's this?

1471
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,370
What is that?

1472
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,000
What's this?

1473
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,620
Hello?

1474
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,560
What's this?

1475
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,650
(What's going on?)

1476
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,390
Here's your last mission.

1477
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,490
(This is your last mission.)

1478
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,130
The last 7 vs 300 mission...

1479
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,730
(Here's the ultimate 7 vs 300 mission.)

1480
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,940
Is "300kg".

1481
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,560
"300kg"?

1482
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,690
(This is the mission that will conclude the 300th episode.)

1483
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,560
You must find a scale with your name on it...

1484
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,870
- and escape the cabin.
 -  Who is it?

1485
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,800
The escape van can carry up to 300kg,

1486
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,130
and those who cannot get on the van...

1487
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,240
must walk to Yangpyeong Station on foot.

1488
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,300
(Who will be left behind?)

1489
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:30,940
(The game has started.)

1490
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,970
I have to find the scale and weigh myself first?

1491
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,260
Where could it be?

1492
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,230
(They must first find the scale with their names on it.)

1493
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,300
Where's the scale?

1494
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,730
Do I just go around?

1495
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,010
No hints?

1496
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,570
It's so eerie here.

1497
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,640
Oh, gosh.

1498
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,790
Where could it be?

1499
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,960
(He's scared and clueless.)

1500
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,290
(He spots something!)

1501
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,390
What's that?

1502
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,660
(He spots something!)

1503
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,830
Who is it?

1504
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,990
(Who is it?)

1505
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,170
What's that?

1506
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,380
Run!

1507
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,430
(Somebody is after us.)

1508
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,440
Run!

1509
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,690
(He runs for his life.)

1510
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,140
What was that?

1511
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,500
What's with the bell?

1512
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,070
- What's that? What's after him?
 -  My goodness!

1513
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,540
- What is it?
 -  Oh, dear!

1514
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,830
(A stranger with a bell is chasing them.)

1515
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:18,930
Why here?

1516
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,260
Why are you coming this way?

1517
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,530
Leave me alone.

1518
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,360
(Jae Seok gets caught but he has no idea why.)

1519
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,470
Please, let me go.

1520
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,670
(Ripping)

1521
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,530
(The stranger rips his name tag off!)

1522
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,160
(What?)

1523
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,630
(Is this a sand bag?)

1524
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:38,040
The escape van can carry up to 300kg.

1525
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,270
(This is a huge penalty for him.)

1526
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,090
- Seok Jin.
 -  Yes?

1527
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,170
- 58?
 -  Who was chasing you?

1528
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,460
There were these two guys in black.

1529
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,990
- That's no joke.
 -  They had bells on them.

1530
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,230
- They went that way.
 -  Did you see them?

1531
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,030
I was tying my shoelaces then ran away because I was scared.

1532
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,160
Why are they hunting us down?

1533
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,030
Only about four of us can escape here.

1534
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,140
How much do you weigh?

1535
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,930
- Why do you ask?
 -  Is it 53kg?

1536
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,180
It's important that we know.

1537
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,590
300kg is the maximum it can hold.

1538
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,640
How much do you weigh?

1539
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,230
- I weight 76kg.
 -  76kg?

1540
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,000
- What about you?
 -  I weight 67kg or 68kg.

1541
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,910
I weigh 70kg. We're 70kg on average.

1542
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,140
She probably weighs 50kg.

1543
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,940
- I weight a little more than that.
 -  Do you?

1544
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,970
- What are we supposed to do?
 -  This doesn't work out.

1545
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,940
Hey, are we supposed to go about...

1546
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,690
- without any hints?
 -  No, actually.

1547
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,830
Seok Jin, remember it said the "finish line"?

1548
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,740
(There was something that referred to the "finish line".)

1549
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,330
- Are these puzzle pieces?
 -  There are writings on it.

1550
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,730
This is the most important hint for the ultimate mission.

1551
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,950
- It's a map.
 -  It's a puzzle.

1552
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,890
- It says "finish" something.
 -  A finish line?

1553
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,230
- All right.
 -  Where is this?

1554
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,190
- It's working out.
 -  It's complete.

1555
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,820
We can see all the important spots.

1556
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,160
It must be spread out. There are many houses.

1557
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,200
We have to go near the houses.

1558
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,840
What if we can't...

1559
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,660
find the scales by dawn?

1560
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,300
We have to check how much we weigh.

1561
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,370
What's this?

1562
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,650
Haha, whose name is on it?

1563
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,850
Look.

1564
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,880
(They find a scale!)

1565
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,000
It's wrapped.

1566
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,250
Whose is it?

1567
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,470
(It's useless if it's someone else's scale.)

1568
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,970
This is how it looks like.

1569
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,670
I hope it's yours.

1570
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:14,800
Yours or mine, right?

1571
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,090
It's Jong Kook's.

1572
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,690
(This scale belongs to Jong Kook.)

1573
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:21,990
I had a feeling.

1574
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,600
(They can't take someone else's scale.)

1575
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,390
(Where's my scale?)

1576
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,440
This is hard.

1577
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,150
- Gosh.
 -  Goodness.

1578
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,940
We have to be thorough.

1579
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,840
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1580
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,590
Jae Seok, how many times did you get caught?

1581
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,690
(How many times did he get caught?)

1582
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,040
- Hey.
 -  Three times?

1583
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,130
- Three times.
 -  Do you get one sand bag each time?

1584
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,200
- Do you want one?
 -  Where's the scale?

1585
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,370
(Jae Seok, come on now.)

1586
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,560
(They wish they had all the puzzle pieces.)

1587
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,830
It's not there. I already checked.

1588
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,140
- It's not here, right?
 -  No.

1589
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,460
(Peeking)

1590
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,860
(Goodness!)

1591
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,430
(He finds a scale!)

1592
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,460
It's not here.

1593
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,390
(He hides it behind the curtain.)

1594
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:03,100
I have a feeling it's somewhere here.

1595
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,370
I have a hunch, too.

1596
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:06,990
Let's head out.

1597
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,790
(Let's go out.)

1598
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,040
It's not here. Let's head out.

1599
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,620
Why?

1600
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,160
Why are you telling me to leave?

1601
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,630
- You saw something, right?
 -  You did.

1602
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:15,640
(They suspect him.)

1603
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,690
No, I don't think there's anything here.

1604
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,550
- Tell me the truth. What was it?
 -  Tell us the truth.

1605
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:20,830
- What?
 -  You saw it, right?

1606
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,110
(He acts very awkward.)

1607
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,110
- Hold on.
 -  Look at this guy.

1608
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,170
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Come on.

1609
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,360
- You saw something, right?
 -  I am wondering.

1610
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,980
I am asking this only because I don't get it.

1611
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,210
How did you know?

1612
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:34,160
I only said, "Let's go out."

1613
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,870
- You said it all of a sudden.
 -  He saw it.

1614
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,790
- He saw it.
 -  You did.

1615
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,790
Whose was it? Was it one of ours?

1616
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:40,840
It's mine, right?

1617
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,690
If it's his, I'll leave.

1618
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,290
(Should I tell them where it is?)

1619
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,660
Let's just leave.

1620
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,070
(He won't tell them.)

1621
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,270
Where did you see it?

1622
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,590
(Goodness!)

1623
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:53,770
Here it is.

1624
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,360
I didn't see it.

1625
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,630
- I didn't open it yet.
 -  Whose is it?

1626
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,590
I only saw the box but I didn't see whose it is.

1627
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,550
(Whom does this scale belong to?)

1628
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,230
- It's you.
 -  It's really Jae Seok's.

1629
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,330
Why?

1630
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:05,000
Kwang Soo, you can't do anything about it.

1631
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,480
Why were you being so obvious?

1632
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,960
I was going to look for it, anyway.

1633
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,770
(Jae Seok locates his scale thanks to Kwang Soo!)

1634
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,500
(Meanwhile, Gary is looking on his own.)

1635
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,360
(He spots something!)

1636
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,660
(He finds it!)

1637
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,860
All right.

1638
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,970
(Please, let it be mine!)

1639
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,690
(Is it really...)

1640
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:33,540
(It's Gary's.)

1641
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,170
(Gary finds his scale.)

1642
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:40,770
(He has to take it to the finish line and weigh himself.)

1643
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,670
Isn't it suspicious that a lot of people are gathered down there?

1644
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,030
(They try to remember the puzzle.)

1645
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:49,160
Which way do I go down?

1646
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,700
(They sprint down the mountain.)

1647
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,200
(The maximum weight it can hold is 300kg.)

1648
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,140
There it is.

1649
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,070
Nobody's here yet.

1650
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,030
There's the van.

1651
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,430
I get to escape.

1652
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,700
(Only a total of 300kg can ride the van.)

1653
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,160
I'm good.

1654
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,830
(Jae Seok is the first one to weigh himself.)

1655
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,740
(He's 72.9kg in total with the bag and the sand bags.)

1656
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,590
Hurry up!

1657
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,360
(Gary follows shortly.)

1658
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,370
Hey, Gary.

1659
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,860
(Are you here now?)

1660
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,970
You have three bags on you.

1661
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
You don't have time for a break.

1662
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,700
I went up by 10kg.

1663
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,660
79.3kg.

1664
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,460
(He's 79.3kg with the bag, camera and sand bags.)

1665
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,530
Do I get on?

1666
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,690
Gary, come in.

1667
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,870
(Jae Seok and Gary are 152.2kg in total.)

1668
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,380
This is scary. What's here?

1669
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,530
Oh, hey!

1670
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,890
(The remaining members start to catch up.)

1671
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:46,940
It's mine.

1672
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,260
(There's only 147.8kg of room left.)

1673
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,600
Is it yours? Are you serious?

1674
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,300
I found it!

1675
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,140
(Who will be able to escape?)

1676
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,700
- Who is it?
 -  Somebody's here.

1677
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,340
I feel so light.

1678
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,740
Is it 152.2kg so far?

1679
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,890
Are you carrying anything?

1680
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,130
No, I'm carrying nothing.

1681
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,860
Then we can probably squeeze in four people.

1682
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,620
How did you not get caught?

1683
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,770
- Then...
 -  Should I take this off?

1684
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,430
If I put this bag on, there's only enough room for Ji Hyo.

1685
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,660
(Kwang Soo tries to unload himself and help the next person.)

1686
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,670
Should I take this off?

1687
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:20,850
Then why won't you take your pants off as well?

1688
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,430
- Why would I do that?
 -  You'll be lighter.

1689
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:25,030
- That's too much.
 -  You wanted to help the next one.

1690
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,340
It's not like I want to help them. I'm just opening up possibilities.

1691
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,300
He's tall.

1692
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,990
(He passes with 78.6kg.)

1693
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,700
- How much?
 -  I'm 78.6kg.

1694
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,640
That's close.

1695
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,650
- How much is it in total?
 -  It's 230kg.

1696
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,330
- What?
 -  It's a little over 230kg.

1697
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,030
It's 230kg? Who's that?

1698
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:43,680
- It's Haha.
 -  What's going on?

1699
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,300
You might make it.

1700
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,610
You have to be at most 69.2kg.

1701
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,330
- Hurry up and weigh yourself.
 -  69.2kg?

1702
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,420
- Yes.
 -  Goodness.

1703
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,280
Can you make it?

1704
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,190
(He starts to take his clothes off.)

1705
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,930
(Every gram counts.)

1706
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,330
Take your microphone off.

1707
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,400
Oh my goodness.

1708
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,370
You won't be able to do it if Ji Hyo arrives here. Hurry up.

1709
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:10,230
(He takes his bag, microphone and even pants off.)

1710
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:12,870
It's 70.4kg. 70.4kg.

1711
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,190
Then it exceeds 300kg, right?

1712
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,730
(He exceeds the limit by 0.6kg.)

1713
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,160
- It's 70.4kg.
 -  Don't film me!

1714
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,440
How many kilogrammes does he have to take off?

1715
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,790
Ji Hyo is here!

1716
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:24,000
(Ji Hyo shows up.)

1717
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,790
- It's 69 point...
 -  69 and what?

1718
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:28,100
It's 69...

1719
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,160
- Stay still. The number will stop.
 -  Make it exact.

1720
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,160
It was 63kg.

1721
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,130
- It's 70kg.
 -  Good. It's 69kg.

1722
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,330
(Will Haha be able to lose 0.6kg?)

1723
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,930
- What's wrong with your feet?
 -  It's 70.4kg.

1724
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:41,340
- It's 70.4kg.
 -  Hold on a second.

1725
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,060
- Should I?
 -  What are you going to do?

1726
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,390
It was really close.

1727
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,660
It's because of this sand bag.

1728
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,170
- It doesn't go down below 70.4kg.
 -  This is the problem.

1729
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,320
- It's Ji Hyo's turn.
 -  Okay.

1730
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,000
- Did you find it?
 -  You won't pass, Jong Kook.

1731
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,960
- Jong Kook has four sand bags.
 -  Gosh.

1732
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
Why do you not have many sand bags like me?

1733
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,830
Do you still need more chances? Did you take your necklace off?

1734
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,770
I already regret that I took all my clothes off.

1735
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,760
It wasn't going to work anyways.

1736
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,860
- Get away from me.
 -  I think Ji Hyo won't make it.

1737
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,660
- Jong Kook, get ready.
 -  Why?

1738
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,560
- Ji Hyo is too heavy.
 -  Really?

1739
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,900
Then...

1740
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,460
(Ji Hyo weighs 53.4kg.)

1741
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:21,140
She weighs 53.4kg. You've definitely passed.

1742
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,700
All right. Everyone, let's get going.

1743
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,170
Haha, you were so close.

1744
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,100
Jae Seok should've taken his bag off.

1745
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,360
I also carried my bag.

1746
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,760
- We didn't know it'd go like this.
 -  Right.

1747
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,060
You are so selfish.

1748
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,690
- We'll leave then.
 -  We'll be leaving now!

1749
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,480
- Goodbye.
 -  Be careful, it will rain.

1750
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,610
What should we do now?

1751
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,700
We have no more chances left.

1752
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,330
It was a long day.

1753
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:51,360
- It was a long day.
 -  I am exhausted.

1754
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,600
(It was a long journey.)

1755
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,160
(Way to Seoul)

1756
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,540
As always, the finale is up to us.

1757
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,460
- Let's go.
 -  Let's think we're exercising.

1758
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,470
- Okay. Let's walk for our health.
 -  Let's go.

1759
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:02,800
I can walk for now, but...

1760
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:07,060
- it's 8km, right?
 -  It's not bad. It won't take long.

1761
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,430
That means I have to walk a 100m-road 80 times.

1762
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,370
Seok Jin, it won't take that long.

1763
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,000
But it's good that we're together. It would've been scary to be alone.

1764
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,890
Gosh, it's too dark.

1765
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,500
(Thank you for loving Running Man. We'll keep doing our best.)

1766
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,260
(You've been racing hard so far. You may rest!)

1767
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,820
- I've been on vacation.
 -  Me, too.

1768
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,930
What does Dangerous Meal mean?

1769
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,800
- There's a lot. Hey!
 -  Gosh!

1770
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,830
- Watch out.
 -  Let's catch them.

1771
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:34,930
Stop there!

1772
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,970
(Dangerous Meal and some dangerous individuals threaten Running Man.)

1773
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:39,690
- Jae Seok!
 -  I think I got a big one.

1774
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,110
(The most dangerous trip in Running Man's history)

1775
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,590
Why are you crying?

1776
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:43,900
(A special guest, Yeo Jin Goo)

1777
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,230
(TWICE)

1778
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,360
I think I was set up...

1779
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,160
- by them.
 -  This is scary.

1780
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,560
What should I do?

1781
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,800
- This is no joke.
 -  I'm sorry.

1782
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,920
Be careful!

1783
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,700
(Dangerous Meal)
