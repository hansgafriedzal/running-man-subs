1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,170
(Early summer in 2016, Ganghwa Island)

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,040
(What race will they have in the summer breeze?)

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,090
(The member who arrives first is...)

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,390
(Jae Seok.)

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,940
- Aren't you hungry?
 -  What?

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,190
- Before the race,
 -  It smells good.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,670
you'll enjoy the food first.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Gosh, what is this?

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,030
(A sumptuous feast for the Running Man members)

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,900
Wow, you've prepared so much food!

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,030
Goodness.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,130
(There are various types of seafood, meat and vegetables.)

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,360
It's amazing.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,800
(They're all in one table.)

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,460
(Sizzling)

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,100
Gosh, these look great!

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,360
(This is quite a feast.)

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,520
This is unbelievable.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,660
We've prepared...

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,560
- white and blue plates.
 -  Okay.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,140
Please choose one plate and help yourself to the food.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,520
Let me see.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,170
I'm wearing a blue cap today.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,200
(Jae Seok chooses a blue plate.)

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,630
My goodness.

26
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,930
(What should I eat first?)

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,100
Goodness, the food looks great.

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,060
(The food looks very delicious.)

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,340
Wow.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,090
This is my favourite.

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,100
(Jae Seok is happy.)

32
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,730
(He puts food on his plate while excitingly making noises.)

33
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,570
This is amazing.

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,490
This is eel.

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,720
(Charcoal-grilled eel and beef)

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,860
This is beef.

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,990
(It's hard to resist.)

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,770
May I have some eel?

39
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,600
Thank you.

40
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,630
(His plate is full of food.)

41
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,990
Gosh, I'm so happy.

42
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,360
(He's very content.)

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,470
It looks so tasty, doesn't it?

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,730
This is so nice.

45
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,870
(Why are they treating us so well today?)

46
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,240
(A plate full of food)

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,800
- Can I eat now?
 -  Before you start eating,

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,090
- please look over there.
 -  Where?

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,200
(Please look over there.)

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,990
Please don't do this.

51
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,400
What is Dangerous Meal?

52
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,470
(Dangerous Meal?)

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,390
(What is this?)

54
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,400
Why is this dangerous?

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,650
I just picked whatever I wanted, so why is this dangerous?

56
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,760
I was about to happily enjoy my breakfast.

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,130
Don't do this to me.

58
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,200
- Please take that "R" off.
 -  You guys are so weird.

59
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,240
What is this?

60
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
I will get you if something weird comes out when I take this off.

61
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,870
What is this?

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,660
What is this?

63
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,640
(A menu?)

64
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,200
Today, you'll have a Dangerous Meal race.

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,060
Please enjoy the food...

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,090
and get the ingredients used for the food you chose.

67
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,330
(They must get the ingredients for the food.)

68
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,690
(How can I get all the ingredients for the food I eat?)

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,870
Goodness.

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Seriously.

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,340
This is ridiculous.

72
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,540
Why do I have to gather the ingredients? Why?

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,930
(He must get various fish, vegetables and crabs.)

74
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,000
Why are you doing this?

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,660
(He's in despair.)

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,460
I shouldn't have chosen this rockfish.

77
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,870
(I should have taken less food.)

78
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,190
(Jong Kook arrives.)

79
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,270
Hello.

80
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,570
Good morning.

81
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,730
I'm sure he'll choose only chicken or beef.

82
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,040
Please take as much food as you'd like to eat.

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,230
- Choose one plate there.
 -  Okay.

84
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,080
(Among the two dishes...)

85
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,260
Well...

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,330
(He chooses the white one.)

87
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,530
Can I take as much as I want?

88
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,690
(The plates represent the teams.)

89
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,800
You've prepared steak, right?

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,400
I have no doubt he'll choose it.

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,750
Gosh, what should I put on my plate?

92
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,300
What are you talking about? We all know what you'll choose.

93
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,420
Yukhoe.

94
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,540
See?

95
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,100
I told you he'll choose beef and chicken.

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,700
(He takes a large amount of yukhoe without hesitation.)

97
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,430
This is sashimi.

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,690
(He loves raw food.)

99
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,700
Chicken porridge is my favourite.

100
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,640
He chose chicken porridge.

101
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,890
He's grilling meat.

102
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,400
(He finds charcoal-grilled meat.)

103
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,100
I want some eel.

104
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,940
He's not on my team, so I hope he takes a lot of food.

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,390
(Jong Kook adds eel and meat to his plate.)

106
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,830
I'm done. Let me eat now.

107
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,900
(He also takes a lot of food.)

108
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,140
Wow, this is nice.

109
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm so excited.

110
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,170
You chose a blue plate.

111
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,560
The best choice I've made today is this blue plate.

112
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,260
(They squabble over nothing as soon as they meet.)

113
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,340
I guessed what you'd choose,

114
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,440
- and you did exactly as I guessed.
 -  No way.

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,640
Please enjoy.

116
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,460
You'll have to get the ingredients of the food.

117
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,840
(You have to get the ingredients of the food you brought.)

118
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,650
(What did you say?)

119
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,100
(I knew there would be something.)

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,460
You brought chicken and beef.

121
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,230
So you have to get all of that.

122
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,490
(He must get various fish, meat and vegetables.)

123
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,310
Okay? This is good.

124
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,430
The chickens will teach you a lesson.

125
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,600
(You need to be taught a lesson.)

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,610
I never thought...

127
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,230
they'd ask us to get the ingredients.

128
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,330
(The mission is beyond his imagination.)

129
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,970
This is unbelievable.

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,470
- It is something I never expected.
 -  I decided to just enjoy the food.

131
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,530
(Following Jong Kook,)

132
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,260
(the other members also arrive.)

133
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,580
What is that?

134
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,190
Such a sumptuous feast means...

135
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,930
today's mission is a hard one.

136
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,160
(Ji Hyo chooses a white plate.)

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,110
This is a great breakfast.

138
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,760
She chose the white plate. Poor Ji Hyo.

139
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,640
(Ji Hyo must get the ingredients of the food she and Jong Kook chose.)

140
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,160
I love these lettuce wraps.

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,990
(Ji Hyo also takes a lot of food.)

142
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,540
There's a lot here. I don't know what to choose.

143
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,610
Gosh, Ji Hyo, don't take too much.

144
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,140
Why is she choosing so many different types of food?

145
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,090
Listen to this.

146
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,200
This boiling sound is so nice.

147
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,030
This is curled mallow soup.

148
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,860
Ji Hyo is doing great!

149
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,370
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook show different reactions.)

150
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,730
You brought all kinds of food.

151
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,700
- You have to get the ingredients.
 -  You need to.

152
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,870
Gosh.

153
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,130
We have to go gather strawberries because of you.

154
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,360
(She even brought fruits and eggs.)

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,760
- Really?
 -  Yes.

156
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,330
Gary's here.

157
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,390
(Gary chooses a blue plate.)

158
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,600
This is an unusual opening.

159
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,170
He chose a blue plate.

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,790
(Knowing nothing yet, Gary also takes various dishes.)

161
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,870
This is the best treatment ever.

162
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,700
We're in trouble.

163
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,900
We'll have to borrow a fishing boat.

164
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,930
Hello.

165
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,370
I like coloured ones.

166
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,290
- No way! Not Seok Jin!
 -  This is exciting.

167
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,540
You know he's really lazy. Gosh.

168
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,590
(But he diligently adds food on his plate.)

169
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,040
- The eel's tail is good.
 -  Strawberry cakes...

170
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,670
Let me have a fried egg.

171
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,730
- Yes!
 -  Gosh!

172
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,900
(They have to get all kinds of ingredients.)

173
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,090
I'll choose this white one.

174
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,360
Plates must be white.

175
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,340
Will you weigh the food I take?

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
Why do you give me such a nice meal? It makes me worry.

177
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,020
I'm worried.

178
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,670
He's choosing similar dishes.

179
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,790
- Long time no see!
 -  Hello.

180
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,340
Are we on the same team?

181
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,150
We have to get the ingredients of the food we eat.

182
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,200
What?

183
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,230
- We have to get the ingredients.
 -  Eat first.

184
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,300
Sorry?

185
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,090
Gary,

186
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,660
we have to get the ingredients for everything we eat.

187
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,930
They said we have to get all the ingredients.

188
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,570
(Gary also chose a lot of food.)

189
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,540
(Haha mainly chose beef.)

190
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,580
(Seok Jin's choice includes fish, vegetables, beef and egg.)

191
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,300
- Hello.
 -  Kwang Soo is here.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Hello.

193
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,650
I hope Kwang Soo chooses a blue plate.

194
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,090
Pick the white one.

195
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,570
He should pick the blue one.

196
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,540
My goodness.

197
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,360
Thank you.

198
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,690
- Gosh, we're done for.
 -  Good choice!

199
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,330
- Wow!
 -  Great choice!

200
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,490
(Kwang Soo is on the Blue Team.)

201
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,290
This is the most frustrating thing of the day.

202
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,900
He's of no help.

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,460
I like tomatoes.

204
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,660
(Kwang Soo takes a lot of food.)

205
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,840
I love cucumber kimchi.

206
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,770
This is a great meal.

207
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,130
(The Blue Team now has to get strawberries.)

208
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,390
There's honey here, too.

209
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,670
(He even adds honey.)

210
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,370
This is how I enjoy strawberries.

211
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,090
Great. You should visit a bee farm.

212
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,430
(The Blue Team has to go to a bee farm.)

213
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,840
- Go to a bee farm and get honey.
 -  I will get him.

214
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,090
I think...

215
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,890
Why did you put honey on your plate?

216
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,430
- Sorry?
 -  Kwang Soo, enjoy the food.

217
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,860
You have to get the ingredients of the food you eat.

218
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,870
(He tells Kwang Soo the rule.)

219
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,470
Do what?

220
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,130
You have to go get the ingredients.

221
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,030
- I have to get these ingredients?
 -  Yes. All of them.

222
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,690
You have to get all the ingredients of the dishes you chose.

223
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,430
- You have to catch eel.
 -  Kwang Soo, there's no choice.

224
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,430
Since you're the only one who chose honey, get it yourself.

225
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,170
- Gosh.
 -  Your team is perfect.

226
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,630
We're thinking about how to push the responsibility to each other.

227
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,980
Is this our team?

228
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,660
- This is our team.
 -  Isn't it obvious?

229
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,140
Why am I getting punished from the beginning?

230
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,390
- Hey! You can't say that.
 -  What's with this team?

231
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,970
You're the one who brings us bad luck.

232
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,930
- So we are all unlucky people.
 -  Hey!

233
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,260
Gary completes the team by bringing his share of bad luck.

234
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,610
(Gary is not an exception.)

235
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,140
We are very unlucky. Our team is complete now.

236
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,540
By the way, there is an empty seat. Someone must be coming.

237
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,300
- You're right.
 -  Right?

238
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,550
- Look!
 -  What is it?

239
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,540
(At that moment, someone appears and surprises everyone.)

240
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,140
(A man with a unique aura appears.)

241
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,570
(It's Yeo Jin Goo, the actor of every girl's dream.)

242
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,180
(He grew from a cute, child actor to a handsome, young actor.)

243
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,900
(He proved his talent the last time he was on Running Man.)

244
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,660
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

245
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
Hello.

246
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,900
It's Yeo Jin Goo!

247
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,290
- Really?
 -  Jin Goo.

248
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,030
Jin Goo, whose mother is the same age as me?

249
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,660
- Yes. Right.
 -  Jin Goo's mother...

250
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,100
- is my age.
 -  Jin Goo's mother.

251
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,400
- Can I take whatever I want?
 -  Yes. Take whatever you want.

252
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,270
Everything will be fine, right?

253
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,870
It feels strange.

254
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,300
Will I have a harder time the more I eat?

255
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,970
It's okay. Eat.

256
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,600
Stop it.

257
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm done.

258
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,310
- You can take it upstairs.
 -  Okay.

259
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,770
Jin Goo!

260
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,160
- Jin Goo!
 -  Hello.

261
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,170
- I remember the last time.
 -  Hello.

262
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,030
- Jin Goo.
 -  Jin Goo,

263
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,430
did you put honey on your food?

264
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,390
Where was the honey? I didn't see it.

265
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,460
He got crabs, too.

266
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,530
Jin Goo, we have to go get all those ingredients.

267
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,260
We have to get the ingredients of the dishes you picked.

268
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,560
You have to get all the ingredients used to cook those dishes.

269
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,870
It makes you lose your appetite, doesn't it?

270
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,240
Jin Goo has to butcher a cow.

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,330
- He has to catch eel.
 -  Also crabs.

272
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,140
- He has to catch crabs.
 -  There is so much.

273
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
- I will explain the rule.
 -  Gosh.

274
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,630
The team that completes the Dangerous Meal first...

275
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,710
through various missions will be the winner.

276
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,210
The team that loses will get...

277
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,680
a truly dangerous meal as a penalty.

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,200
(What is this truly dangerous meal?)

279
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,630
I will tell you what that means.

280
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,230
It contains food that is good for your body but uncomfortable to eat.

281
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,990
It includes one of the seven stinkiest food, stinky tofu,

282
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,360
which is a Chinese beloved health food.

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,530
It also includes pickled herring, which is five times stinkier,

284
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,760
Sophora root tea, fermented skate and many more.

285
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,220
(We will take charge of your sense of smell.)

286
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,660
(They are terrified.)

287
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,520
- I once got stinky tofu on my hand.
 -  I am sorry, but...

288
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,350
The smell lasted for two weeks.

289
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,530
Pickled herring smells five times worse?

290
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,990
Here's your first mission.

291
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,290
It is called the "Ingredient Gathering War".

292
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,900
You have to get all the ingredients within the time limit.

293
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,770
At every spot, you will have an opportunity to obtain a card.

294
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,580
The winner of the first mission will be given an advantage...

295
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,870
that can be used for the final mission.

296
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,590
(The Ingredient Gathering War begins.)

297
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,460
(Each team has a list of ingredients they must gather.)

298
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,910
(The two teams head to different areas.)

299
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,630
- We have to get the card.
 -  Right.

300
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,090
- Jin Goo.
 -  Yes.

301
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,400
What's good about being an adult?

302
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,720
What do you want to do the most?

303
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,400
Since I have a driver's license...

304
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,930
If you were to go on a trip,

305
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,000
which girl group member would you take with you?

306
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,430
Who's your type? I don't care about the looks.

307
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,700
- Do you want me to guess?
 -  Sure.

308
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,170
I think I know who it is.

309
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,950
- It's her. That's right.
 -  Jun Hyo Seong?

310
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,800
What do you think about a girl like Hyo Seong?

311
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,460
She's beautiful.

312
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,060
- Right?
 -  You were so quiet all along!

313
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,260
He reacted.

314
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,760
- I've never seem him so excited.
 -  I know.

315
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,530
I have her number.

316
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,700
Do you really have her number?

317
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,770
Call her.

318
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,440
(His heart pounds.)

319
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,940
- Maybe she won't pick up.
 -  Hello?

320
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,090
(His heart starts racing.)

321
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,170
- Hyo Seong.
 -  Oh, dear!

322
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,830
- We're shooting Running Man.
 -  Is that right?

323
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,990
- Yes.
 -  Hyo Seong!

324
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,070
This week's celebrity guest...

325
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,000
chose you as his ideal type.

326
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,380
- Talk to him and guess who he is.
 -  Go ahead.

327
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,630
Listen to his voice.

328
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,270
Here. Talk to her.

329
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,360
Hello.

330
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,660
(He has a great voice.)

331
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,300
- Hello. Who are you?
 -  My goodness.

332
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,040
- They're getting acquainted.
 -  I am...

333
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,290
- Yeo Jin Goo.
 -  Oh, dear!

334
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,840
Hello.

335
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,970
Hyo Seong, what do you think about Jin Goo?

336
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,130
- He's every girl's dream.
 -  Oh, gosh!

337
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,630
(He's every girl's ideal man.)

338
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,270
Talk to her, Jin Goo.

339
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,810
I'm excited, too.

340
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,290
Ask her to have dinner with you one day.

341
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,790
- Let's eat dinner sometime.
 -  Okay.

342
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,670
(Let's have dinner.)

343
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,360
(He's a real man.)

344
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,530
"Let's eat dinner sometime."

345
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,460
It sounds very nice when you say it.

346
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,860
(His low voice is irresistible.)

347
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm fascinated.

348
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,730
- Okay, Hyo Seong.
 -  Hey.

349
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,000
Jin Goo told me to tell you this.

350
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,670
"You're my girl."

351
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,330
(You're my girl.)

352
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,840
"You're my girl."

353
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,860
- Thank you, Hyo Seong.
 -  Thank you.

354
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,070
Thank you.

355
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,530
- Why am I getting hot?
 -  Tell us if there's someone else.

356
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,400
We will instantly call that person.

357
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,390
Now, I know what kind of style he likes.

358
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,570
- Do you?
 -  Yes. I know.

359
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,870
(Gary and Ji Hyo come to fish because they ate fish.)

360
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,770
This is the match of the century.

361
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,040
- The match of the century.
 -  A match of the century.

362
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,860
(This is where Ji Hyo and Gary will have the match of the century.)

363
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,340
It's lovely.

364
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,630
Gosh, listen to the seagulls.

365
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,400
The sound of the seagulls makes me realise that I'm near the sea.

366
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,390
(Welcome. It's been a long time, hasn't it?)

367
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,670
It's the ocean!

368
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,430
Please give me fish!

369
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,590
(Will Ji Hyo and Gary be able to catch fish?)

370
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,260
Bye.

371
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,390
(They're ready to go out.)

372
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,920
- Don't you think it's too empty?
 -  Goodbye.

373
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,560
Bye, seagulls.

374
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,700
- Seagulls!
 -  Seagulls.

375
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,860
Seagulls!

376
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,560
(It sounds like a name of a mixed drink.)

377
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,920
What kind of big fish can you catch here?

378
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,330
Trout and grey mullet.

379
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,960
How big are they? This big?

380
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,590
We sometimes catch big ones which are a few metres long.

381
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,930
- A few metres?
 -  A metre?

382
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,000
One metre long.

383
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,190
Today is that day.

384
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,040
(Today is the perfect day to catch a big fish.)

385
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,900
(It's the match of the century! Who will catch the big fish first?)

386
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,900
- I feel it. Is this the spot?
 -  Yes.

387
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,830
I got the feeling.

388
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,130
He's putting on the bait.

389
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,170
- Please put one here, too.
 -  You can do it here.

390
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,330
(He's terrified.)

391
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,270
(They're in shock.)

392
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,930
(Is that really a worm?)

393
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,840
That looks more like a centipede.

394
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,230
No way.

395
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,560
(What is that monster?)

396
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,580
- That's a centipede.
 -  Where did you get this?

397
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,470
- This worm grows in this area.
 -  Really?

398
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,530
(They must endure this after eating a few pieces of fish.)

399
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,600
That looks like a centipede. I hate it.

400
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,740
(They put the worm on the rod and start fishing.)

401
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,740
- Let it go while throwing it.
 -  Do I let go while throwing it?

402
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,430
(Throwing)

403
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,770
Where did it go?

404
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,200
(It sinks.)

405
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,970
(Let's wait.)

406
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,690
Nice!

407
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,440
(Gary throws the rod, too.)

408
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,670
(They look the same.)

409
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,580
(There's a silence.)

410
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,000
Fishing is like fighting with time.

411
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,070
It went in well, right?

412
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,990
(There is no sign of biting.)

413
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,060
(Suddenly)

414
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,640
I feel like I caught something.

415
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,090
Look at that. Doesn't it look like it's moving?

416
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,800
I think it's moving.

417
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,340
It's moving!

418
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,040
Sir! Captain! I think I caught something!

419
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,510
Look! I caught something!

420
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,070
I caught something, Ji Hyo!

421
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,460
- Did you?
 -  Look!

422
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,290
I think it's a big one!

423
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,590
- Ji Hyo, look!
 -  It looks like a big one!

424
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,800
My goodness!

425
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,770
(Will I lose like this?)

426
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,470
(Let's see.)

427
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,430
What?

428
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,470
(There is nothing.)

429
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,390
Your worm is gone.

430
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,220
Captain. Sir.

431
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,370
Captain, what happened?

432
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,130
(I don't know.)

433
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,440
It's here.

434
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,560
(It looks like there's really something this time.)

435
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,900
It's biting! Ji Hyo, it's biting!

436
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,600
You caught it! You caught it!

437
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,540
It's nothing...

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,370
- There's nothing.
 -  Just leave it be.

439
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,270
It's here! Ji Hyo, it's here!

440
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,580
Ji Hyo! This is crazy!

441
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,410
It's moving! The tail is moving!

442
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,990
Hey! Ji Hyo!

443
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,830
I think it's a shark!

444
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,370
(A shark?)

445
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,760
(The shark just ate the worm and disappeared.)

446
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
Captain, what is wrong?

447
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,260
Captain, what's wrong with me?

448
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,340
(Is Gary fishing for fish or for luck?)

449
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,530
What type of crab do we need to catch?

450
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,910
I'm not good at catching crabs.

451
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,470
Don't they bite?

452
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Of course.

453
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,970
Do you really think they won't?

454
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,250
Man, I'm worried.

455
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,460
It must be here.

456
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,640
The map says we've arrived.

457
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,160
- There is a mudflat on our left.
 -  What is it?

458
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,770
- Here.
 -  There are a lot of holes.

459
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,930
This area is completely covered in mud.

460
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,290
(The endless mudflat makes them sigh.)

461
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,570
My goodness.

462
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,370
(There are many large tools waiting for them.)

463
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,220
- I haven't been here for some time.
 -  It's been so long.

464
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,990
- The other members have it easier.
 -  It's a mudflat.

465
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,040
- Isn't that a crab hole?
 -  I think so.

466
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,240
(Welcome to the mudflat.)

467
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,060
- Greetings, everyone.
 -  Okay.

468
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,690
- You can grab...
 -  By the way, who are you?

469
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm a sub-producer, Park So Hyun.

470
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,430
- Really?
 -  You must be the new sub-producer.

471
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,700
Let's introduce ourselves first.

472
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,960
My goodness.

473
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
They must hire based on looks these days.

474
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,940
What are you saying?

475
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,830
- What are you talking about?
 -  You don't know for sure.

476
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,330
- She's really pretty.
 -  It was so sudden.

477
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,980
You could've just said that she's beautiful.

478
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,660
But you went like this. What was that?

479
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,530
- She's pretty. Greetings.
 -  My goodness.

480
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,560
This is a mudflat where you can grab your crabs.

481
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,260
- All right.
 -  Was that a rhyme?

482
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,470
"You can grab your crabs"?

483
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,160
Here at a mudflat, we can catch crabs

484
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,410
- What are you doing?
 -  Are you serious?

485
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,090
You might get buried in a mudflat if you keep doing that.

486
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,340
Watch your tongue, Seok Jin.

487
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,090
(Embarrassed)

488
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,860
You have five minutes in total.

489
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,860
Freely choose a tool from the table.

490
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,400
- We can freely choose.
 -  If you catch a total of 20 crabs,

491
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,860
you will be granted a chance to draw a card.

492
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,790
Wait. But why do we need fat?

493
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,730
Is this to lure the crabs?

494
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,660
- Or a snack?
 -  I can't tell you.

495
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,400
- You must figure out its purpose.
 -  Crabs must eat this.

496
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,910
They might smell the fat.

497
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,470
Can crabs smell?

498
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,050
Can they?

499
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,130
(Slapping)

500
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,730
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

501
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,280
Seok Jin. You know how bad I can be if I really want to.

502
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,660
- You know him.
 -  Seok Jin,

503
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,240
I'll put this in your nose and take it out of your mouth.

504
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,700
(I'll put it in your nose and pull it out of your mouth.)

505
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,360
(The time limit is 5 minutes.)

506
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,130
- We don't have to go far.
 -  We don't need to go far.

507
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,460
- Look. Come here.
 -  There are no crabs.

508
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,160
- Here. Get ready. Come, Seok Jin.
 -  Okay.

509
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,790
- Ready.
 -  Dig it.

510
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,990
(Jae Seok finds a suitable spot.)

511
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,070
Are there any?

512
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,410
Are there any?

513
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,240
Why aren't there any?

514
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,270
(Screaming)

515
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,230
Oh, gosh.

516
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,740
(What's wrong?)

517
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,300
It's an anaconda.

518
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,360
- That's gross.
 -  They must be nearby.

519
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,970
Deep in there. Here.

520
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,600
They must be in here.

521
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,760
- Step back. Go back.
 -  Dig here.

522
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,030
(It's their second attempt.)

523
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,770
- Look. Here's a crab.
 -  Where?

524
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,060
(Slipping)

525
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,460
- Why are you pushing me down?
 -  Hey, look.

526
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,060
- Where?
 -  Here. Right here.

527
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,630
- It must be underneath.
 -  Get ready to grab it.

528
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,470
(Will it be a crab this time?)

529
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,400
(Screaming)

530
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,900
(They are in panic for the second time.)

531
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,800
- It's irritating.
 -  What is that?

532
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,910
- That's really gross.
 -  There is a snake underneath.

533
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,060
It's not even moving.

534
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,440
- Gross.
 -  That was horrible.

535
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,160
- There must be some crabs.
 -  Worms are everywhere.

536
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,530
- Let's change the spot.
 -  Hurry.

537
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,760
There are so many worms.

538
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,340
Why are there so many worms?

539
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,540
Let's try here.

540
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,910
You're a professional crab hunter. You decide without any hesitation.

541
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,190
- Do you mean it?
 -  Crab hunter.

542
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,900
- I just realised that...
 -  Do you hunt crabs?

543
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,970
I'm the only one digging.

544
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,730
It's because you always go ahead us.

545
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,190
- Like this.
 -  Everyone has their own role.

546
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,900
All right. We're crab hunters.

547
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,250
- Dig here.
 -  Step back. It's dangerous.

548
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,090
I'll dig deep at once.

549
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,960
- Here we go.
 -  Come on.

550
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,230
(Will they catch crabs this time?)

551
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,400
(We don't want to dig up nothing any more.)

552
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,870
- Yes!
 -  Okay!

553
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,430
(We got you!)

554
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,830
- It's really big.
 -  What is that?

555
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,870
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
 -  Great.

556
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,060
- Yes.
 -  It's really big.

557
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,660
- Wow.
 -  What is that?

558
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,460
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
 -  Jae Seok is really good.

559
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,090
- Did you see that?
 -  You're really good.

560
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,860
- It gave me the chills.
 -  It's a crab.

561
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,730
You're a real crab hunter.

562
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,440
- Did you catch it?
 -  I really got the chills.

563
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,070
- Amazing.
 -  Look. It's dancing.

564
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,630
- That's big enough to serve five.
 -  Seriously,

565
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,590
- it's a king crab.
 -  It's like we're at a crab buffet.

566
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,590
- Where is the next spot?
 -  It's as big as a lobster.

567
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,400
Okay, give me the way. Let's go.

568
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,370
This hole is big.

569
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,540
- This is the spot.
 -  Dig in.

570
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,130
- Kwang Soo. Come.
 -  This hole is big.

571
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,630
- Hey, look.
 -  Get ready.

572
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,860
- How many minutes do we have?
 -  It's here!

573
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,030
- Where?
 -  It's right here.

574
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,860
- It's big.
 -  Yes. It's big.

575
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,870
(The crab hunter has done it again.)

576
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,930
- It's here.
 -  Where is it?

577
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,860
- It's right here.
 -  Hurry. Catch it.

578
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,390
- Here.
 -  I got it.

579
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,800
It's not moving.

580
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,970
- Here's another.
 -  Where?

581
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,740
(Come grab a crab.)

582
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,000
- It's solid.
 -  Kwang Soo.

583
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,160
Seok Jin. Don't just stand there and help him.

584
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,200
Okay.

585
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,460
That's why we get penalised all the time.

586
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,740
There's always a reason.

587
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,260
- I found one.
 -  Where?

588
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,130
- I got it.
 -  Good job.

589
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,190
You need to catch some, too, Seok Jin.

590
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,830
I have sharp eyes, just like an eagle.

591
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,930
(They make a really nice team for crab hunting.)

592
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,070
We only needed Kwang Soo and me to come here.

593
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,170
Is it over?

594
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,400
Were we able to catch 20?

595
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,540
All right. Let's count them.

596
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,690
Put all the crabs that you caught...

597
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,320
in the plastic box in front of you.

598
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,440
We can cook a crab dish with these.

599
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,300
- Look at this. One.
 -  One.

600
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,530
- I don't think there are 20.
 -  It tried to bite me.

601
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,790
- They're so small.
 -  Two.

602
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,270
They can be hiding.

603
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,100
- It must be really small.
 -  Three.

604
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,200
- Four.
 -  Four.

605
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,410
Six.

606
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,170
How did you catch a crab like this?

607
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,440
- 14.
 -  Here's another.

608
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,470
- 15.
 -  15.

609
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,730
- 16.
 -  That's right.

610
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,800
- 17.
 -  17.

611
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,830
(They are focusing really hard.)

612
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,440
Gosh.

613
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,270
- No way.
 -  That big one.

614
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,990
Wait.

615
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,060
I think three of them...

616
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,430
Why aren't you touching the big ones?

617
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,450
- I'm scared.
 -  Because it's scary.

618
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,600
Put it on top of this.

619
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,270
(They use the fat to pick it up.)

620
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,150
- Oh, my.
 -  It's scary, isn't it?

621
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,940
We only picked up small ones.

622
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,830
It's so big and clearly visible, but no one's grabbing it.

623
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,990
We have many things in common, such as this.

624
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,260
- I'm scared.
 -  We all are.

625
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,990
- It bites.
 -  Be careful.

626
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,470
- Careful.
 -  Move. Let's do it like this.

627
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,130
- I'll do it.
 -  It has big claws.

628
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,460
It's big enough to serve many.

629
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,160
So we only need one more crab. Don't we?

630
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,770
(They just counted the 19th crab.)

631
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,990
- Look. What is this?
 -  There's one more.

632
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,530
- Where is it?
 -  There. Right there.

633
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,460
- It's really there.
 -  It's amazing.

634
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,680
It's really amazing. We need to film it closely.

635
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,940
It's amazingly small.

636
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,790
(It's an extremely small, micro crab.)

637
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,330
- This may...
 -  What is it?

638
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,760
- Can you see it?
 -  This?

639
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,730
It's a crab. Can you see it?

640
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,670
- Is it a biological crab?
 -  It is.

641
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,260
This is the one, right?

642
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,860
- It's a crab.
 -  It fell down.

643
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,150
It really is a crab. It's a crab. That's amazing.

644
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,690
(They successfully catch 20 crabs.)

645
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,530
I should give them this fat so they can eat it.

646
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,830
Do they eat this? Do they eat fat?

647
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,690
(Actually, that fat is...)

648
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,160
(to lure crabs into a trap.)

649
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,360
- Really? No way.
 -  Amazing.

650
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
- Wait. Do you really mean it?
 -  Yes.

651
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,690
- Shall we give it a try?
 -  I'm curious.

652
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,390
- No way.
 -  I've never heard such thing.

653
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,390
But it takes around a day.

654
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,740
- Nonsense.
 -  What are you doing?

655
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,060
Do you want to fight me in the mudflat?

656
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,530
Are you teasing us?

657
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,570
(I just told you the truth.)

658
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:38,160
(Fat Trap: If you bury a bowl and put fat in, it'll lure crabs.)

659
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,590
- You succeeded, so...
 -  Okay.

660
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,630
I'll give you the chance to draw a card.

661
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,050
I'm not so confident about this.

662
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,060
- I don't think we should.
 -  Can you choose one for us?

663
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,090
- I'll draw one, then.
 -  Yes. Please draw one for us.

664
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,530
We're all unlucky.

665
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,590
(Producer Park So Hyun will draw.)

666
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,470
- No, not that one.
 -  I don't think that's the one.

667
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,030
You shouldn't participate in the draw.

668
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,390
- She's new.
 -  I can see the wrong ones.

669
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,040
Please draw any, Producer Park.

670
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,660
Okay. Good.

671
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,230
This is Producer Park's choice.

672
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,460
All three of us are unlucky.

673
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,910
We didn't participate at all.

674
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,470
Let's see what her choice is.

675
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,340
How old are you again?

676
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,220
- She's not good.
 -  We mustn't ask her again.

677
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,990
- No, this is invalid.
 -  It's invalid.

678
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,460
- Because you drew this card.
 -  We were supposed to draw.

679
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,590
We must draw our card.

680
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,970
Why are you meddling in our own problems?

681
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,330
- Wait. This must be invalid.
 -  No way.

682
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,590
- Producer Park, we decided that...
 -  This isn't right.

683
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,660
we will draw the card.

684
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,570
- Put this card back in the deck.
 -  Okay. We'll draw again.

685
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,690
Which card will you choose? What's your guess?

686
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,040
- I'd choose this one.
 -  This? Let's remove this one.

687
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,150
Shall we pick a card each?

688
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,190
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors, Kwang Soo.

689
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,790
- The winner's card.
 -  We'll go with the winner's card.

690
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,030
- Let's go.
 -  Rock, paper, scissors.

691
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,040
- Rock, paper, scissors.
 -  Rock, paper, scissors.

692
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,730
(Seok Jin wins.)

693
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,540
(What is Seok Jin's card?)

694
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,570
I'm sorry, guys.

695
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,470
- No way.
 -  I'm sorry.

696
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,960
- No way.
 -  I'm sorry.

697
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
(It's the No Chance Card.)

698
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,630
(Seok Jin is always unlucky.)

699
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,800
My goodness.

700
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,060
- Maybe they're all No Chance Cards.
 -  No. Open them.

701
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,330
- No way.
 -  No way.

702
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,070
(What are the other cards?)

703
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,070
(It's a Location Card.)

704
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,900
(Oh my goodness.)

705
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,860
We're really unlucky.

706
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,650
How can this be?

707
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,060
Why is it? It's a mystery.

708
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,790
We need to hire someone to find out why.

709
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,470
(Blue Team fails to acquire a card.)

710
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,830
- How can this happen?
 -  It doesn't make any sense.

711
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,430
- We're just unlucky.
 -  How does this happen?

712
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,990
We should've gotten a card.

713
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,820
We failed to pick a card twice in a row.

714
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,100
Where should we head next?

715
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,940
- Where else do we need to go?
 -  The strawberry farm is nearby.

716
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,070
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go pick them.

717
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,000
- It's 6, 1, 1.
 -  It's 1, 1.

718
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
- Yes?
 -  Hello.

719
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,240
Blue Team, your next destination is...

720
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,440
the bee farm.

721
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,280
- Really?
 -  Don't we have a choice?

722
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
White Team...

723
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,540
won their game...

724
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,870
and used the Location Card. So you must go to the bee farm.

725
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,170
I caught it again. Isn't this too easy? Goodness.

726
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,390
Oh, dear.

727
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,530
Goodness.

728
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,940
You can do it. There you go.

729
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,390
- Let's go.
 -  Hyo Seong is watching.

730
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,440
Good job.

731
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,460
- We're done!
 -  It's done!

732
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,670
- You've passed.
 -  Aren't we amazing?

733
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,190
- Can I see it?
 -  Yes.

734
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,030
(White Team picks a card.)

735
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,270
- It's a Location Card.
 -  All right.

736
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
You can pick the other team's next location...

737
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,460
and disrupt their plans.

738
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,130
- Should we go with the bee farm?
 -  Should we?

739
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,330
- Okay.
 -  We pick the bee farm.

740
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,430
- Sure.
 -  All right!

741
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,260
- That's great!
 -  Awesome!

742
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,640
- This is great!
 -  Let's go!

743
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,730
Just feed us stinky tofu!

744
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,090
(You scoundrels!)

745
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,260
They won the game.

746
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,900
Our team is cursed!

747
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,350
- We need Hwang Jung Min here.
 -  My goodness.

748
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,460
We need a shaman here.

749
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,120
We really need a shaman here.

750
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,790
This is where "The Wailing" is really taking place.

751
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,460
This is insane.

752
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,540
- I can't believe this.
 -  I wanted to avoid the bee farm.

753
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,840
What if we get stung by a bee?

754
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,520
I didn't even think about that.

755
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,360
I'm more upset at that team...

756
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,330
because we're right by the strawberry farm.

757
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,430
- It's near here.
 -  Is it?

758
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,570
- This is the farthest from here.
 -  Really?

759
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,760
Why did you have to dip the strawberries in honey?

760
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,830
Oh, gosh.

761
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,190
(Strawberries and honey are delicious.)

762
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,270
- That was for dessert.
 -  Why would you?

763
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,830
Who dips strawberries in honey?

764
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,530
You're a troublemaker.

765
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,050
I didn't even see the honey.

766
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,820
Am I a troublemaker for dipping strawberries in honey?

767
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,080
My gosh.

768
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,410
Are you saying you're not?

769
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,620
Isn't that causing trouble?

770
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,890
We have to hurry up...

771
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,410
or we'll have to eat stinky tofu.

772
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,860
We have sea sickness...

773
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,730
(They can't go fishing due to sea sickness.)

774
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,940
And we can't go on rides because we'll throw up.

775
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,640
We're afraid of heights...

776
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,770
and scared that the crabs will bite.

777
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,930
I'm also scared of the dark.

778
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,200
Oh, gosh. Why was I born like this?

779
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,730
My goodness.

780
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,090
(They approach the bee farm.)

781
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,940
- It's the bee farm.
 -  We're really here.

782
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,070
How are we supposed to do that?

783
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,530
I've never done this before.

784
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,640
Must we do this?

785
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,470
It's because you dipped strawberries in honey!

786
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,260
The staff members didn't do anything wrong,

787
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,890
and they look like they're in a warfare.

788
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,990
(The staff members brace themselves.)

789
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,670
(They're fully equipped.)

790
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,030
(You may enter, but you won't be able to get out easily.)

791
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,190
- I see bees already.
 -  There are a lot of them.

792
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,930
What are we supposed to do?

793
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,300
We'll get stung as soon as we open the door.

794
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
We'll get stung as soon as we get out.

795
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,070
We're going to get stung by the bees.

796
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
There are bees out here.

797
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,550
We can't get off.

798
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,210
How's this different from going into lava?

799
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,760
I can clearly see the bees outside. How am I supposed to get off?

800
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,360
- There are bees outside!
 -  They're everywhere.

801
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,660
They want us to get stung.

802
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,930
Give us the clothes.

803
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,910
They're not aggressive so you can get off.

804
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,930
How do you know how they are?

805
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,000
Are you friends with them?

806
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,530
This is driving me nuts.

807
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,030
Hey, Kwang Soo.

808
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,840
- This is your fault.
 -  We'll stay in the car...

809
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,530
- and you can go.
 -  Bring us the clothes.

810
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,660
Bring us the honey.

811
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,270
Hurry up.

812
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,560
- How?
 -  You...

813
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,730
What do you mean?

814
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,660
You're a devil!

815
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,740
How could you say that?

816
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,030
There are bees everywhere.

817
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,700
- We're in trouble.
 -  Look at those bees.

818
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,730
- Where are the clothes?
 -  Look at the bees.

819
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,830
- We have to cover up first.
 -  Hurry up.

820
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,460
- Hold on. Don't bees...
 -  Don't they like yellow?

821
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,730
- like this colour?
 -  It's the colour of honey.

822
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,130
Why do you get green, but we get yellow?

823
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,630
This is the colour of forsythias.

824
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,700
It looks sweet.

825
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,630
- Come on, Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo, you brat.

826
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,010
(Kwang Soo, you rascal.)

827
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,800
We have to change quickly.

828
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,640
Isn't this too small?

829
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,470
Is it supposed to stick to your body?

830
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,940
My nose is pressed down. What about you?

831
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,160
(He can't breathe.)

832
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,580
- Why is this so tight?
 -  It's because you have a big nose.

833
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,040
It doesn't cover my ankles.

834
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,530
- And...
 -  My ankles might get stung.

835
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,600
(Kwang Soo is exposed.)

836
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,130
(He gets his ankles taped.)

837
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,270
Let's go together.

838
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,640
We're such cowards.

839
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,300
You're fully equipped.

840
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,010
Are you wearing boots?

841
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,050
They look like boots.

842
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,390
- It's necessary.
 -  I have a trauma.

843
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,190
I've been stung by a hornet twice.

844
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,630
What do you not have a trauma about?

845
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,230
(Jae Seok is full of traumas.)

846
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,140
You have a bunch of traumas.

847
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,620
Why did you dip it in honey?

848
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,930
- He has traumas about everything.
 -  Kwang Soo.

849
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,460
Why did you dip it in honey?

850
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,990
Let's get started quickly.

851
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,190
The other team...

852
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,260
- is ahead of us.
 -  Let's pick the Location Card...

853
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,060
- and make them suffer.
 -  Exactly.

854
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,530
Let's send them to the most difficult one.

855
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,540
Let's get going.

856
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,530
(The bees work hard...)

857
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,200
(and make honey.)

858
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,890
Look at this, Jae Seok.

859
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,350
- My gosh.
 -  Be quiet.

860
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,940
- Wow.
 -  Oh my goodness.

861
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,970
There are about 30,000 to 50,000 bees in each box.

862
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,040
You have to create fumes first.

863
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,000
This is mugwort.

864
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,930
You create smoke.

865
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,160
(Smoke is created by burning mugwort.)

866
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,360
- I can smell it.
 -  Let's close it.

867
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,230
(Bees don't like the smell of mugwort.)

868
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,760
- Hold the brush.
 -  I smell it.

869
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,770
- All right.
 -  Is this it?

870
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,340
Hold onto it.

871
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,040
Let me calm them down.

872
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
Stop taking all the easy jobs.

873
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,400
- Should I open the lid?
 -  Sure.

874
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,840
Is this it?

875
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,560
(Yelling)

876
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,670
Why? What's wrong?

877
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,090
- Hold on. There are so many.
 -  There are too many of them.

878
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,270
- What should we do?
 -  What do we do now?

879
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,870
- Should I open it?
 -  Before you open it,

880
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,460
do this first.

881
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,590
(They open it slightly.)

882
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,640
That's insane.

883
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,390
Spray it!

884
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,000
Hey, slow down.

885
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,730
Slow down.

886
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,690
- Oh, gosh.
 -  I'm sorry, bees.

887
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,270
- Slow down.
 -  Sorry.

888
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,770
Watch this.

889
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,010
Listen to the sound.

890
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,140
- Are they mad?
 -  Wow.

891
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,450
- What do you do now?
 -  Is this a lot of honey?

892
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,600
What comes next?

893
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,060
You have to shake them off.

894
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,370
- Do you?
 -  Please.

895
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,270
That's good.

896
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,300
Kwang Soo.

897
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,090
Would two of these fill up a container?

898
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,100
(Jae Seok gives it a go.)

899
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,070
- Do it here.
 -  It's not easy.

900
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,420
(He has to be brave and shake the bees off.)

901
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,610
(Will Jae Seok be able to do it?)

902
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,360
There are so many of them.

903
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,810
(He shakes it.)

904
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,570
(All of the bees fly off.)

905
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,560
Don't do that!

906
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,430
- Stop doing that!
 -  Hurry up!

907
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,840
- Don't shake it so fast!
 -  Hurry up!

908
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,690
Brush them off!

909
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,390
Hurry! Brush them off!

910
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,470
- Who told you to do that?
 -  Hurry!

911
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,520
I think they're attacking me, Kwang Soo.

912
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,830
Sorry, bees.

913
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,960
- Oh, dear.
 -  It's all good.

914
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,260
(These cowards are frightened.)

915
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,170
(They finish the first one.)

916
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,940
- I'm sorry, bees.
 -  I'm sorry.

917
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,330
You punk, you shouldn't have had the honey.

918
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,140
- I only had a little.
 -  Next.

919
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,660
(Kwang Soo gives it a go to make up for it.)

920
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,670
Oh my goodness.

921
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,440
- Look at this.
 -  There are hundreds of them.

922
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,350
They look upset and aggravated.

923
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,530
Hurry up.

924
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,970
- Do I shake it now?
 -  Go for it.

925
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,240
(Shaking)

926
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,800
They're aggravated.

927
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,300
- The smoke!
 -  They're angry.

928
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,160
We need the smoke!

929
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,330
- Just shake it off!
 -  It's not there.

930
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,590
- Hurry up!
 -  We need the smoke.

931
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,160
- I said, hurry up!
 -  The smoke!

932
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,360
Spray it.

933
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,650
Put it back in.

934
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,840
- I'm sorry.
 -  I'm sorry for ruining your house.

935
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,890
They're going nuts.

936
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,170
- That almost got me.
 -  We won't forget this.

937
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
I can't move an inch.

938
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,940
Hey, Jong Kook!

939
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,390
(White Team is on their way to catch chickens.)

940
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,640
Jin Goo, you picked the right team.

941
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,370
You got to speak to your ideal girl and you'll win as well.

942
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,540
Do you like cute women? How's Son Na Eun?

943
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,660
- I actually really like Apink.
 -  Do you really?

944
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,300
- I really like their songs.
 -  I see.

945
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,310
- There are a lot of them.
 -  Who's your favourite in the group?

946
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,830
Which type of woman do you like from Apink?

947
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,400
- Who do you think is nice?
 -  Who is it?

948
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,310
I...

949
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,530
(It's okay, you can tell us.)

950
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,810
I...

951
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,530
like Ha Young.

952
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,300
(Is it Ha Young?)

953
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
- It's Oh Ha Young, right?
 -  Yes.

954
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,460
- She's the youngest in the group.
 -  That's right.

955
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,660
Let me make a call again.

956
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,630
- It's all right.
 -  Let me just ask her.

957
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,800
- Go ahead.
 -  No, it's okay.

958
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,700
I find it funny how you were trying to act like you don't know her.

959
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,430
I know, right?

960
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,730
You probably know everything about her. Look at this guy.

961
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,030
- He does.
 -  Hello?

962
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey, Bo Mi.

963
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,600
- Hey, Haha.
 -  Are you busy?

964
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,930
We're shooting Running Man right now.

965
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,990
- Hi, Bo Mi!
 -  Are you?

966
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,190
- It's about Ha Young.
 -  Okay.

967
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,880
What type of men does she like?

968
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,130
(His heart is pounding.)

969
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,370
- Ha Young?
 -  Yes.

970
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,440
(Ha Young?)

971
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,660
She likes men like Lee Min Ki...

972
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,460
Does she like Jin Goo, by any chance?

973
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,390
(What about Jin Goo?)

974
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,750
- Yeo Jin Goo?
 -  Yes.

975
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,630
Ha Young is downstairs. Should I get her?

976
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,860
- Okay!
 -  Yes!

977
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,090
- Hold on.
 -  Okay.

978
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,440
This is perfect.

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,360
- My goodness.
 -  Hello.

980
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,470
Hello, Ha Young.

981
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

982
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,070
- Who's this?
 -  Talk to her.

983
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,640
- Come on.
 -  My name is Yeo Jin Goo.

984
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,800
You're lying! Aren't you Kwang Soo?

985
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,870
(Are you Kwang Soo?)

986
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,210
Ha Young.

987
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,540
It is Jin Goo.

988
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,700
It is Jin Goo. Don't regret it later.

989
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,860
- Ha Young.
 -  I don't think so.

990
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,940
Let's not drag this on. We'll do this only once.

991
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,990
We're going to play a game of telepathy.

992
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,330
(Jin Goo and Ha Young will play a game.)

993
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,360
- Sure.
 -  Is it jjamppong or jajangmyeon?

994
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,140
You'll pick one after I count down.

995
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,000
All right, the two of you. This is a game of telepathy.

996
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,990
Do you prefer jjamppong or jajangmyeon?

997
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,300
In one, two, three!

998
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,470
(Is it jjamppong or jajangmyeon?)

999
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,670
(He signals her to choose jajangmyeon.)

1000
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,810
In one, two, three!

1001
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,600
- Jajangmyeon.
 -  Jajangmyeon.

1002
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,360
(They chose the same one.)

1003
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,430
It's meant to be!

1004
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,690
Look at this. I'm getting goosebumps!

1005
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,760
(Jin Goo's heart is racing.)

1006
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,890
- Right?
 -  I'm getting goosebumps.

1007
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,470
Before you go, he wants to say something.

1008
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,260
- That's right.
 -  Go for jajangmyeon.

1009
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,660
- Let's have jajangmyeon later.
 -  Excellent.

1010
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,870
- Perfect.
 -  This is great.

1011
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,330
Are you really Jin Goo?

1012
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,840
- It is.
 -  It is me.

1013
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,850
Any time. I know a good restaurant.

1014
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,260
- Oh, wow.
 -  Thank you.

1015
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,140
That's great.

1016
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,440
If you say, "Mr Chu",

1017
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,010
Jin Goo will say, "Chu".

1018
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,030
You can sing a line,

1019
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,270
and he'll say "Chu". Then we hang up.

1020
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,440
- Mr Chu
 -  Chu

1021
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,360
- Chu on my lips
 -  Chu

1022
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,690
(Mr Chu, chu on my lips.)

1023
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,200
(How's this possible?)

1024
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,760
(Ha Young makes him smile.)

1025
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,550
We'll call you another time.

1026
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,730
- Yes.
 -  Bye.

1027
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,900
This is perfect.

1028
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,630
(I'll see you at the jajangmyeon restaurant.)

1029
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,800
This is great.

1030
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,470
- I should let Hyo Seong know now.
 -  My gosh.

1031
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,530
(I forgot about Hyo Seong.)

1032
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,960
- You guys should just be friends.
 -  You're mean.

1033
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,090
- I feel bad for her.
 -  You could be...

1034
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,040
- good friends with her.
 -  That's right.

1035
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,160
- Hyo Seong.
 -  Yes.

1036
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,600
It's about Jin Goo, but don't get offended.

1037
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you know of Ha Young from Apink?

1038
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,660
- Apink?
 -  Yes, she's the youngest member.

1039
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,960
He's already moved on to her.

1040
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,530
Did he change his mind?

1041
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,810
"Did he change his mind?"

1042
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,960
But you two can be good friends.

1043
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,190
You'll be like a family. Let's keep it that way.

1044
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,330
(Let's root for each other.)

1045
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,170
How did this happen out of nowhere?

1046
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,300
(I need to hear an explanation.)

1047
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,930
She's disappointed.

1048
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,710
- You're disappointed, right?
 -  She is.

1049
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,870
Jin Goo wants to say sorry. Hold on.

1050
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,990
Say something, Jin Goo.

1051
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,570
All right. Hyo Seong, you have to treat me next time.

1052
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,340
(You still need to buy me dinner.)

1053
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,330
You're quite funny, aren't you?

1054
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,260
(You're a funny kid.)

1055
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,470
(Why should I treat you?)

1056
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,230
That was funny. Good one.

1057
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,590
- That's enough.
 -  Leave it at that.

1058
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,630
- That was funny.
 -  "You're quite funny."

1059
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,040
She made me laugh.

1060
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,970
(They finally arrive at the chicken farm.)

1061
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,810
Let's go.

1062
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,240
Jin Goo's never caught a chicken before.

1063
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,340
It probably hurts when they peck you.

1064
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,340
Doesn't it hurt when they peck at you?

1065
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,060
This is a farm where you can obtain chickens.

1066
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,230
- You must catch them yourselves.
 -  Right.

1067
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,230
Under the heading "Wanted",

1068
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,760
there are specific chickens that you must catch.

1069
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,890
- You must bring them back.
 -  They're marked.

1070
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,590
- Look at the nose.
 -  There's a heart.

1071
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,590
- That's a plus sign.
 -  There's the plus sign...

1072
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,330
- and this one's just white.
 -  It's a white string.

1073
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,730
All right, I get it.

1074
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,390
There are 60 chickens inside the fences.

1075
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,990
You have three minutes.

1076
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,890
- Three minutes?
 -  Aren't we using bare hands?

1077
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,860
How are we supposed to catch them?

1078
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,960
(This one's huge.)

1079
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,030
Those are huge. Look at the black one.

1080
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,170
- Get set, go!
 -  Hold on.

1081
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,700
Look first. We have to search for them first.

1082
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,690
Look. It's not this one.

1083
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,700
- Gosh, look at this one.
 -  It's not that one.

1084
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,890
- What's this?
 -  I think that's it.

1085
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,960
- I think it's this one.
 -  This one?

1086
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,470
Try catching it.

1087
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,460
- Which one?
 -  It's a triangle.

1088
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,400
- Isn't that it?
 -  Look at its claws.

1089
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,970
- What now?
 -  I can't see the marks.

1090
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm going nuts.

1091
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,990
Hey, don't do that. I'm scared.

1092
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,760
(He's startled.)

1093
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,940
Come this way.

1094
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,000
They hide so well amongst themselves.

1095
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,460
(Swift)

1096
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,190
(Aren't they fast enough to be ostriches?)

1097
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,440
(Come on, chickens.)

1098
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,760
(He spots one!)

1099
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,940
I found Kkomi.

1100
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,830
Did you find it?

1101
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,120
(It's similar to the picture.)

1102
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,340
- It's Kkomi.
 -  That's it.

1103
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,660
Run. Catch it!

1104
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,730
(It's fast.)

1105
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,130
It's so fast.

1106
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,290
(It takes a sharp turn.)

1107
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,040
- Haha, it's this one.
 -  Where?

1108
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,100
Wait, I'll corner it.

1109
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,470
- Oh, gosh.
 -  Goodness.

1110
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,230
(You're such rookies.)

1111
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,640
Hey, hey.

1112
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,060
(Jin Goo corners it.)

1113
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,840
- Block that side.
 -  I got it.

1114
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,040
I got this side. Catch it. You got it.

1115
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,960
(They succeed!)

1116
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,190
You got it! Go.

1117
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,230
You got it.

1118
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,440
(It's caught.)

1119
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,220
- Let me see the mark.
 -  It's Kkomi.

1120
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,530
You're correct!

1121
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,590
(They are a match.)

1122
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,700
- You have one minute left.
 -  What do we do?

1123
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,630
- Isn't this it?
 -  Where?

1124
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,920
Is it a heart?

1125
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,810
- It has a heart.
 -  It's that one!

1126
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,630
(It runs for its life.)

1127
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,570
Catch it for me. It's that one!

1128
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,230
- Catch it.
 -  It's that one, right?

1129
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,960
- It's that one.
 -  Is it the right one?

1130
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,730
- It's this one.
 -  This one.

1131
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,340
It's this one.

1132
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,700
(He catches it in one try.)

1133
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,460
You're amazing, Jong Kook.

1134
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,090
(Jong Kook is so talented.)

1135
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,270
Take the wing.

1136
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,290
Is this right? It is.

1137
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,130
(They have 15 seconds left. This is their last chance.)

1138
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,330
- It's correct, right?
 -  Yes, you got it!

1139
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,460
(They are a match.)

1140
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,990
That wasn't easy.

1141
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,730
- We're awesome.
 -  Good job.

1142
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,370
- How did you do that?
 -  How did you catch it?

1143
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,270
I can't believe I've been working with him for six years.

1144
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,140
I respect him so much.

1145
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,460
Jin Goo, you caught one in the beginning.

1146
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,970
He's in a great mood, so why don't we do an acrostic poem?

1147
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,660
Your word is "Chicken", Jin Goo.

1148
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,060
In 1, 2, 3. "Chick".

1149
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,190
"Chick".

1150
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,530
("Chick")

1151
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,680
Shut your mouth?

1152
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,180
(Shut your mouth.)

1153
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,360
- Stop it.
 -  Shut your mouth.

1154
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,640
- All of you, shut your mouth.
 -  That's funny.

1155
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,460
You've completed the mission, so you'll pick a card.

1156
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,160
- We're too strong.
 -  Pick...

1157
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,430
- a card.
 -  They'll never pass this mission.

1158
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,940
- All right.
 -  There you go.

1159
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,660
That one's good.

1160
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,300
As long as it's not a No Chance Card, it's fine.

1161
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,060
- Please.
 -  Open it.

1162
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,030
(What did he choose?)

1163
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,730
(Is he astonished?)

1164
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,130
- Please.
 -  Open it.

1165
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,530
- It's a Free Card.
 -  It's a Free Card.

1166
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,030
- Do we win an ingredient?
 -  Yes.

1167
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,040
Okay!

1168
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,690
That's perfect. He picked a good one.

1169
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,860
- We'll take crabs.
 -  Let's cross that out.

1170
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,270
We are not going to catch crabs.

1171
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,810
(White Team has eel, crab and chicken.)

1172
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm getting sleepy.

1173
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,370
Do you make ramyeon on the boat?

1174
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:39,070
(They make 3 bags of ramyeon with shrimp.)

1175
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,840
(It's seafood ramyeon.)

1176
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,270
Oh, yes.

1177
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,070
- Oh my goodness.
 -  Look at the shrimps.

1178
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,960
(Ramyeon on the boat has a strong fragrance of the sea.)

1179
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,200
Thank you for the food.

1180
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,570
(Slurping)

1181
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,600
This is no joke.

1182
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,270
It's delicious.

1183
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,900
(You have to try this.)

1184
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,600
(He peeks at the fishing rods while they eat.)

1185
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,070
Is there more?

1186
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,620
- Where?
 -  That one's moving.

1187
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,140
(Did it move?)

1188
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,930
Is it mine?

1189
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,960
(Ji Hyo is quick to get up.)

1190
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,430
Sir, it feels loose.

1191
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,940
No, it can't be.

1192
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,610
I caught something, Gary!

1193
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,160
(Something's on the hook!)

1194
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,590
Gary! Gary!

1195
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,460
- Gary!
 -  No!

1196
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,030
- This can't be!
 -  I caught a fish!

1197
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,690
(Shrieking)

1198
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,360
- Captain, I'm scared!
 -  Be careful! Watch the ramyeon!

1199
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,790
- Captain, Captain!
 -  Don't drop it in the ramyeon!

1200
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,470
I'm so scared.

1201
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,370
What do I do?

1202
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,970
(It's a big catch.)

1203
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,670
(Will I ever beat Ji Hyo?)

1204
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,240
You said this side was better.

1205
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,700
Why did she catch it over there?

1206
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,890
(Sighing)

1207
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,100
I lost again.

1208
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,440
You're good to go. You're always lucky.

1209
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,860
(Ji Hyo goes ashore first.)

1210
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,030
- I'm leaving.
 -  See you, Ji Hyo.

1211
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,050
- Bye.
 -  What are you doing next week?

1212
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,140
- Next week?
 -  I'll face you again next week.

1213
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,250
Okay, Ji Hyo?

1214
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,330
(Waving)

1215
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,900
I'll see you next week!

1216
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,470
Gary, cheer up!

1217
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,270
(He's no rival to the lucky Ji Hyo.)

1218
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,400
Why can I never beat her?

1219
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,670
(He cannot fall behind. He must hurry.)

1220
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,600
(He gives it a big swing.)

1221
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,690
(He casts 5 fishing rods into the water.)

1222
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,070
If I can't catch anything like this, it means I'm cursed.

1223
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,970
(Let's wait and see.)

1224
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,870
(I wish luck is on my side.)

1225
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,590
(He watches like a hawk.)

1226
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,740
(At that moment!)

1227
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,630
(It moves.)

1228
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,930
I got it. I'm certain.

1229
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,840
It's coming along!

1230
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,100
It's biting! Please don't swim away!

1231
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,200
This one's strong! It's strong!

1232
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:23,990
(What has Gary caught?)

1233
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,670
(It's a big catch.)

1234
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,660
(He catches a bigger fish than what he ate earlier.)

1235
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,970
(A squid catches a fish.)

1236
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,360
I caught it right away.

1237
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,270
(Both teams manage to catch fish.)

1238
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,460
We're done with that part.

1239
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,310
(Blue Team is still collecting honey.)

1240
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,460
Are we removing the by-products?

1241
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,990
- Yes.
 -  You have to make a path...

1242
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,940
- for the honey to flow.
 -  You have to skim off the layer.

1243
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,770
This knife is hot.

1244
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,900
- Is this edible?
 -  Yes it is.

1245
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,690
This is beeswax.

1246
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,000
Is this beeswax?

1247
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,990
- The honey is dripping.
 -  Look at the honey.

1248
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,990
- Look.
 -  It's full.

1249
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,540
It melts when you put the hot knife to it.

1250
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,900
This is amazing.

1251
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,390
Ouch! It's inside my body.

1252
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,700
- Really?
 -  Where?

1253
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,230
- It's inside of me.
 -  You're joking.

1254
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,370
- I'm not.
 -  Where?

1255
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,830
Where?

1256
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,240
- It's not inside.
 -  It's stuck to your head.

1257
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,250
You coward.

1258
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,190
I swear it hit me with its wings.

1259
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,990
It hit you like this?

1260
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,080
What a joke. Please understand him.

1261
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,330
I apologise.

1262
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,600
- It's really in there!
 -  Is it?

1263
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,740
(Has it gone through the suit?)

1264
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,930
(The bee is inside.)

1265
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,170
It's inside, Jae Seok!

1266
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,700
- Is it? Where?
 -  You didn't believe me.

1267
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,860
- How did it make it in there?
 -  I might get stung.

1268
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,640
(The bee breaks through the protective layer.)

1269
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,520
(They need a countermeasure in place.)

1270
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,890
(What? What's this?)

1271
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,790
(Seok Jin sprays him.)

1272
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,270
- No, Jae Seok! Don't do that.
 -  Where is it?

1273
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,460
- Hurry.
 -  Don't move.

1274
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Hey, hey. Why would you open this completely?

1275
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,460
Do it quickly! Come on!

1276
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,550
- I'm almost done.
 -  The bees are...

1277
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,830
flying around me.

1278
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,960
- There was no bee.
 -  What are you doing? No, there was.

1279
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,090
- There's a bee.
 -  Do it quickly!

1280
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,170
(He's in a hurry.)

1281
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,170
- Gosh.
 -  You just laughed, didn't you?

1282
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,190
- There really was one.
 -  How did it get in there?

1283
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,150
- Look at this.
 -  I don't understand.

1284
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,400
How did it get in there?

1285
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,340
I don't know either.

1286
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,860
Then let me spin this.

1287
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,250
Spin it. Jae Seok.

1288
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,640
That's too fast.

1289
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,140
Slow down.

1290
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,470
- It's coming.
 -  It is.

1291
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,040
It's coming out.

1292
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,230
This must be very sweet.

1293
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,430
- It's amazing.
 -  This is real honey.

1294
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,560
This is real, isn't it?

1295
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,830
Kwang Soo, let's visit the strawberry farm after this.

1296
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,020
Sounds good.

1297
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,400
Let's take some of the honey and dip strawberries in it.

1298
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,390
Wow, that's a lot.

1299
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,270
(Blue Team obtains honey.)

1300
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,360
- Now's the time to get a card.
 -  Okay.

1301
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,460
Why don't you pick one?

1302
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,690
- What if we fail again?
 -  No way.

1303
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,830
(Will they be unlucky again?)

1304
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,870
Take one card for yourself.

1305
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,760
- Remove one card.
 -  Okay.

1306
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,140
I removed one card for you.

1307
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,270
I should think before I pick. I was so thoughtless before.

1308
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,960
- Right.
 -  Yes.

1309
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,360
For your information, the card I removed is a Location Card.

1310
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,690
(It's a Location Card.)

1311
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,760
We need to get it right this time.

1312
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,460
There are two chance cards out of the three.

1313
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,730
- What's important is...
 -  We should pick a chance card.

1314
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,140
Let's do this.

1315
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,240
If you are not confident, just give up.

1316
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,030
If you are confident, stay here.

1317
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm out.

1318
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,890
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1319
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,130
- Show me your card.
 -  Show it to us.

1320
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,360
One, two...

1321
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,740
(Which card does he have?)

1322
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,400
- It's a Free Card.
 -  My goodness.

1323
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,140
(We're so unlucky.)

1324
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,660
This is not good.

1325
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,730
(He's totally unlucky.)

1326
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,990
This is crazy. I should've had the No Chance Card.

1327
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,660
There's one Steal Card and one No Chance Card.

1328
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,430
- We can steal something with it.
 -  This is unbelievable.

1329
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,790
Please! We must pick the Steal Card.

1330
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,920
- Forget about being funny.
 -  How about rock-paper-scissors?

1331
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,190
Let's pick the loser's card.

1332
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,960
- Let's pick the loser's card.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors!

1333
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,460
Jae Seok lost.

1334
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,560
- Do you want to switch?
 -  Okay.

1335
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,900
(They decide to exchange.)

1336
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,970
(What will be the result?)

1337
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,440
We're done for if we don't get the Steal Card.

1338
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,830
(Will their unlucky fortune continue?)

1339
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,900
(Or will they be able to catch up with the Steal Card?)

1340
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,240
(Steal Card)

1341
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,330
(This is a jackpot!)

1342
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,330
- Great.
 -  We made it.

1343
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,560
It's good that we exchanged our cards.

1344
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,610
If we didn't, we'd be doomed.

1345
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,730
- We're destined to get this card.
 -  We should always exchange cards.

1346
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,890
We must switch our cards.

1347
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,890
- It was a good choice.
 -  We can change our fate!

1348
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,050
We should exchange our cards at the last minute.

1349
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,230
- Let's not catch eels.
 -  White Team will go there.

1350
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,630
(Blue Team takes White Team's eels.)

1351
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,900
(Blue Team obtains honey and takes eels from White Team.)

1352
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,740
The strawberries are very fresh. We can eat them now.

1353
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,590
- Wow, there are cows.
 -  Right.

1354
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,830
(White Team obtains milk.)

1355
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,650
Can I pick this from the root, Ma'am?

1356
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,270
These grow a lot in summer, right?

1357
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,360
This game is called "Vegetable Halli Galli".

1358
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,460
(Both teams meet at the vegetable farm.)

1359
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,230
- Okay!
 -  What are you doing?

1360
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,590
You did great.

1361
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,230
You're so good at this.

1362
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,540
Since White Team won,

1363
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,960
we'll give you a chance to pick a card.

1364
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,600
(What card did White Team pick?)

1365
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,990
(The "Ingredient Gathering War" is over.)

1366
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,290
I can drink the tea.

1367
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,470
You should eat the stinky tofu.

1368
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,940
- Wow, this is honey.
 -  Great.

1369
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,210
Please put them on the table.

1370
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,660
You've put all the ingredients on the table.

1371
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,230
- Please look at the board.
 -  Okay.

1372
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,470
White Team brought...

1373
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,030
fish, chicken, crab, milk and vegetables.

1374
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,690
- Okay.
 -  Blue Team brought...

1375
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,630
crab, fish, honey, eels,

1376
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,060
- strawberries and vegetables
 -  Right. We have one more than them.

1377
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,690
- We haven't opened our card yet.
 -  Oh, the card?

1378
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,210
It can be the No Chance Card.

1379
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,460
- It shouldn't be the Steal Card.
 -  Then we'll be fine.

1380
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,830
- Please pick the No Chance Card.
 -  Please.

1381
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,460
- Open it now.
 -  No Chance Card!

1382
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,230
- No Chance Card!
 -  Don't let it be the Steal Card.

1383
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,560
- I think they have the Steal Card.
 -  Goodness.

1384
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,790
In 1, 2, 3!

1385
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,530
(What...)

1386
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,730
(card...)

1387
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,840
(will it be?)

1388
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,370
(It has to be Steal Card.)

1389
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,760
(It's Steal Card!)

1390
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,270
Ji Hyo is a lucky girl!

1391
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,360
- Is it the Steal Card?
 -  Yes.

1392
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,730
- It's unbelievable.
 -  My goodness.

1393
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,460
- It's amazing.
 -  Goodness.

1394
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,560
- I didn't know I'd pick that card.
 -  That's amazing.

1395
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,970
Can you believe this?

1396
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,660
Can you?

1397
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,760
- Let's steal eels.
 -  What about honey?

1398
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,640
- We caught eels.
 -  Let's take eels.

1399
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:43,030
- Give them eels.
 -  Okay. Take eels.

1400
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,070
- This is...
 -  Hey, take our eels.

1401
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,340
To the White Team who won,

1402
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,590
- we'll give...
 -  What?

1403
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,190
- an advantage...
 -  Is there something else?

1404
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,160
- for the final round.
 -  That's not necessary.

1405
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,660
- Good! We got an advantage.
 -  This is great.

1406
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,870
- What is this?
 -  What's that?

1407
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,090
(White Team has an advantage.)

1408
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,780
(What will it be?)

1409
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,090
This is for you.

1410
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,440
(Revival Card)

1411
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,560
- Wow.
 -  Revival Card?

1412
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,460
- I don't know what this is for.
 -  Is it okay to show this to them?

1413
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,260
- Gosh.
 -  Can we revive with this?

1414
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,130
There's no one to revive on that team.

1415
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,360
- It's our team that needs the card.
 -  They don't need it.

1416
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,060
Many of us need to revive.

1417
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,790
They don't need the card at all!

1418
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,440
- They won't die.
 -  We can die.

1419
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,770
- This is ridiculous.
 -  That card is to revive the dead.

1420
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:30,560
- They're not dead yet.
 -  Look at Gary.

1421
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,760
- I'm lost for words.
 -  What is this?

1422
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,070
I am really angry.

1423
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,930
I can see how angry he is.

1424
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,760
I am really mad.

1425
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,060
Since you had a long day acquiring the ingredients,

1426
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,230
we've invited special guests...

1427
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,790
to cheer you up.

1428
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,940
Really?

1429
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,890
- Really?
 -  Where are they?

1430
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,170
- There they are.
 -  Wow!

1431
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,730
This is unbelievable!

1432
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,140
(Am I dreaming now?)

1433
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,230
- Wow!
 -  Welcome!

1434
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,300
(The atmosphere is freshened.)

1435
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,310
(It's TWICE who topped various music charts with "CHEER UP".)

1436
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,790
- Wow, It's TWICE.
 -  This is great.

1437
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,590
- Good to see you.
 -  Hello.

1438
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,960
- Hello.
 -  Welcome to Running Man.

1439
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,290
- It's so nice to see you.
 -  Hello.

1440
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,590
- Hello.
 -  Isn't it cold?

1441
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,460
- Wow.
 -  Hello.

1442
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,090
In 1, 2, 3. One in a million. Hello, we're TWICE!

1443
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,770
Wow.

1444
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,990
("CHEER UP" captivated everyone's ears.)

1445
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,690
(They've made all the guys fall for them.)

1446
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,870
(The 9 members each have different charms.)

1447
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,730
Wow, here you are!

1448
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,460
You're very cute and pretty!

1449
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,570
- They're cute.
 -  I'm not tired any more.

1450
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,790
We can sing TWICE's songs as much as we want and enjoy.

1451
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,470
- Right.
 -  But Jin Goo can't.

1452
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,290
- Right.
 -  That's sad.

1453
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,830
- Why can't he enjoy them?
 -  It'd be hard for him.

1454
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,670
- I see.
 -  He talked about Ha Young.

1455
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,960
- This isn't easy for him.
 -  He said he talked to her.

1456
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,130
My goodness.

1457
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,560
- Ha Young thanked me.
 -  Right.

1458
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,360
- Ha Young is attractive.
 -  He's cute.

1459
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,160
- We'll make teams.
 -  Okay.

1460
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,640
To be fair,

1461
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,130
those who choose the same colour will form a team.

1462
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,860
Pick one, Jeongyeon.

1463
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,140
He knows each member's name.

1464
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,760
She picked a white spoon.

1465
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,460
- Good choice.
 -  Great.

1466
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,660
It's Tzuyu's turn.

1467
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,390
(Tzuyu also picks a white spoon.)

1468
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,090
- Great!
 -  Good.

1469
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,900
- Nice.
 -  You did a good job.

1470
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,060
- Done!
 -  Let's go play the game.

1471
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,250
This will be fun.

1472
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,390
Sana is in our team.

1473
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,730
(TWICE members are split between the teams.)

1474
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,670
Let me announce the final mission.

1475
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,240
(What will this big group do?)

1476
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,260
- "Dangerous Recipes".
 -  "Dangerous Recipes"?

1477
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,460
- He's a dangerous director.
 -  He loves dangerous missions.

1478
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,970
Why is everything so dangerous?

1479
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,730
Today's final mission is "Dangerous Recipes".

1480
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,860
Blue Team with nine members...

1481
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,450
should complete recipes for Western dishes.

1482
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,160
And White Team with eight members...

1483
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,770
will complete recipes for Korean dishes.

1484
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,390
Please discuss with your members and hide the ingredients...

1485
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,960
that the other team needs under your name tags.

1486
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,630
When we give the start signal, you'll play Name Tag Elimination...

1487
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,890
and take the ingredients which are under others' name tags.

1488
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,030
Then, complete the recipe first with the ingredients you get.

1489
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,370
The team to finish first wins.

1490
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,560
We have three butter and milk ingredients.

1491
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,460
They should be put on those who can defend themselves well.

1492
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,380
- Jin Goo...
 -  Salmon.

1493
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,460
I'll hide broccoli.

1494
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,730
Momo, come here.

1495
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,800
Hide this under the tag.

1496
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,370
Gosh.

1497
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,140
(Bumping)

1498
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,340
You focused all your attention on TWICE, didn't you?

1499
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,930
Don't embarrass us in front of TWICE!

1500
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,610
Please don't do this.

1501
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,460
- This is your problem.
 -  You can't come this close!

1502
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,040
You shot me from a distance at the bee farm!

1503
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,570
This is a serious problem.

1504
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,140
A member from each team...

1505
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,590
will have Pepper Bombs under their name tags.

1506
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,460
If anyone eliminates the Pepper Bomb name tag,

1507
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,670
the team he or she is on will lose immediately.

1508
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,530
- Really?
 -  Immediately?

1509
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,660
(Pepper Bomb is very dangerous!)

1510
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,290
Wow, this is unexpected.

1511
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,930
They can't use the Revival Card, can they?

1512
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,290
- Pepper Bomb! Pepper Bomb!
 -  Pepper Bomb! Pepper Bomb!

1513
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,430
- Pepper Bomb! Pepper Bomb!
 -  Then...

1514
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,240
we should be careful with ripping.

1515
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,390
Today's highlight is...

1516
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,860
- It's the Pepper Bomb.
 -  Yes, it's the Pepper Bomb.

1517
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,230
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
 -  We can do it!

1518
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,510
(Which team will get the penalty?)

1519
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,940
Let's go for it.

1520
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,200
- We can do it.
 -  Okay. Let's Go!

1521
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,190
- We must win this time.
 -  We should.

1522
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,930
- We should find the lunchbox first.
 -  Right.

1523
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,120
- Let's find the blue one.
 -  Right, the blue one.

1524
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,030
We're looking for a lunchbox. Tell me if you find one.

1525
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,230
(They look for Pepper Bomb hints.)

1526
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,330
What should I do? Do I just look around?

1527
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,760
Take a close look like this.

1528
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,060
(The hint informs of the other team's Pepper Bomb.)

1529
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,340
You'll find it somewhere.

1530
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,400
Do they usually hide things behind water purifiers?

1531
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,690
We must win.

1532
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,460
(Dahyun searches thoroughly.)

1533
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,570
What is behind this?

1534
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,960
Where is the lunchbox?

1535
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,790
(Where are you, lunchbox?)

1536
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,240
Excuse me.

1537
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,630
Even though I might fail to eliminate name tags,

1538
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,690
- I want to find a lunchbox.
 -  Me, too.

1539
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,160
(TWICE politely keeps searching for a lunchbox.)

1540
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,170
Nothing is there. I've already checked.

1541
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,940
I'm sure something is near here.

1542
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,630
No, no.

1543
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:09,700
- I think it could be here.
 -  It can't be here.

1544
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,670
No, it's not in a big place like this.

1545
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,530
It's not here.

1546
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,870
Is the lunchbox here?

1547
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,930
(She starts talking to the cameraman.)

1548
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,690
- Is it here?
 -  It's not here.

1549
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:19,930
- Is it not here?
 -  It's not in...

1550
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,540
- a big space like this.
 -  It's here, isn't it?

1551
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,980
- Is it really not here?
 -  It should be somewhere small.

1552
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,270
I think it's here.

1553
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,470
My intuition tells me it's here.

1554
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,400
I'm just going to rip a name tag first.

1555
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,300
- Already?
 -  Yes.

1556
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,430
What if you get Pepper Bomb?

1557
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,460
(What if he picks Pepper Bomb?)

1558
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,890
The chances are too low.

1559
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,660
(There is a 1 out of 9 chance of getting it.)

1560
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,840
I still won't do it...

1561
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,130
because I am unlucky.

1562
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,930
First of all, we have to collect many recipes.

1563
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,160
(Gary thinks they must rush.)

1564
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,640
That's one way.

1565
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,270
It'd be helpful if we knew their gender.

1566
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,870
Someone's coming.

1567
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,300
It's Ji Hyo.

1568
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,170
- Should we rip her name tag?
 -  Let's rip it.

1569
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,690
- Where are you going?
 -  This building.

1570
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,860
So one of you is not the Pepper Bomb for sure.

1571
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,990
Who knows?

1572
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,330
At least one of you isn't.

1573
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,090
Why? You must be the Pepper Bomb.

1574
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,010
That's why you're filled with confidence.

1575
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,340
- You are the Pepper Bomb.
 -  No.

1576
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,160
It's positive that one of you isn't.

1577
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,540
Okay. Try ripping us then.

1578
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,060
Kwang Soo, you can rip it.

1579
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,470
I can't do it because of our past relationship.

1580
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,230
What are you talking about?

1581
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,460
- We had a past, you know?
 -  What are you talking about?

1582
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,460
If I do it and fail, you will blame it on me.

1583
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,810
- No!
 -  So is that it?

1584
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,300
So you are the Pepper Bomb.

1585
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:27,840
Should we begin by ripping name tags?

1586
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,940
I don't think neither of them has the Pepper Bomb.

1587
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,830
- I know.
 -  Anyway...

1588
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,090
(At that moment,)

1589
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:35,130
(Jong Kook and Tzuyu come to rescue them.)

1590
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,390
- I think it's Kwang Soo.
 -  First...

1591
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,830
Anyway...

1592
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,270
- I don't think it's him.
 -  He's here, he's here.

1593
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,260
- Jong Kook is here.
 -  Oh, dear.

1594
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,090
- Jong Kook is here.
 -  I think it's Kwang Soo.

1595
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,840
- What should we do?
 -  Let's run.

1596
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,270
Then we should've run immediately!

1597
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,360
- We should've done that!
 -  So run faster!

1598
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,460
What's wrong?

1599
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,740
Jong Kook, Kwang Soo is the Pepper Bomb.

1600
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,840
Do you think it's Kwang Soo?

1601
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,100
(I will sprinkle pepper on you.)

1602
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,870
He's coming! He's running!

1603
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,890
Hurry up!

1604
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,070
(It's like a conditioned reflex.)

1605
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,700
- Why are you...
 -  Why are we running away?

1606
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,960
- Jong Kook is coming.
 -  What is it for?

1607
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,240
Why are we running away?

1608
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,330
- Jong Kook must be the bomb.
 -  But we are four.

1609
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,940
- It's the four of us.
 -  He must be it.

1610
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,220
- We're four people. Let's not run.
 -  He might be the Pepper Bomb.

1611
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,670
- I'm certain that he's not.
 -  Really?

1612
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:28,640
(What is Jong Kook's identity?)

1613
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,830
Actually, this is yours.

1614
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,930
(30 minutes ago at White Team's strategy meeting)

1615
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,260
(It's the card that could instantly change everything.)

1616
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,830
(White Team made Jong Kook the Pepper Bomb.)

1617
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,700
- He might be the Pepper Bomb.
 -  I'm certain that he's not.

1618
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,540
They can't rip our name tags for sure.

1619
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,210
- It's because...
 -  That's not it.

1620
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,360
It could be Tzuyu.

1621
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,100
Maybe it's Tzuyu and Jong Kook is just guarding her.

1622
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,800
Right. That's possible.

1623
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,180
But if she's the Pepper Bomb, they don't need to be together.

1624
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,350
Maybe they're trying to fake it.

1625
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,030
They made it really easy to rip Jong Kook's name tag.

1626
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,130
It could be Tzuyu.

1627
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,190
(While Jong Kook and Tzuyu distract them,)

1628
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,860
Let's go find some hints.

1629
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,630
(Jin Goo and Dahyun look for hints.)

1630
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,670
(They search carefully.)

1631
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,570
- I think they hid it around here.
 -  Right?

1632
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,440
- I think so.
 -  I have that feeling.

1633
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,340
- Why?
 -  It's here.

1634
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,240
I found it.

1635
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,290
- I found it.
 -  Did you find it?

1636
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,390
(They finally found it.)

1637
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,530
(Blue Team's Pepper Bomb is a man.)

1638
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,840
- It's a man?
 -  It's a man.

1639
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,530
(Who are the men on the Blue Team?)

1640
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,840
We have to let everyone know.

1641
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,290
There is Jae Seok, Kwang Soo,

1642
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,260
- Gary and Seok Jin.
 -  Seok Jin.

1643
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,730
- It's one of those four.
 -  It's one of them.

1644
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,030
So we have to hurry up and tell everybody.

1645
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,090
(TWICE is not the Pepper Bomb.)

1646
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,400
Let's hurry up and tell the others that the Pepper Bomb is a man.

1647
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,670
It should be around here, but it's not.

1648
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,400
Why isn't it here?

1649
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,270
Isn't this it?

1650
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,870
(He finds the lunchbox!)

1651
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,940
I got it.

1652
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,070
(He found it!)

1653
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,890
- What is it?
 -  "Blue Team's Pepper Bomb..."

1654
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,870
I knew it.

1655
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,670
Blue Team's Pepper Bomb is a Running Man member.

1656
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,990
- Then it could be Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1657
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:05,230
- He was approaching us fiercely.
 -  Should we destroy this?

1658
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,460
It wouldn't be here, would it?

1659
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,950
(Chaeyoung and Sana try to find a lunchbox, too.)

1660
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,440
- It's not in here, right?
 -  I don't think it's there.

1661
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,200
Where should we go?

1662
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,530
(At that moment, Jin Goo and Dahyun appear.)

1663
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,560
Where should we go?

1664
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,970
(Oh my gosh!)

1665
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,730
What? Why?

1666
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,060
(The first battle breaks out.)

1667
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,470
Don't do this to us!

1668
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,330
(Sana is driven into a corner.)

1669
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,470
Don't do this to me! Where are you going, Chaeyoung?

1670
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,200
- Chaeyoung, don't go.
 -  I am sorry, Sana.

1671
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,930
(Sorry, Sana.)

1672
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,090
What's wrong?

1673
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,560
Chaeyoung, be careful.

1674
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,840
(Chaeyoung barely got away.)

1675
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,560
- Jin Goo is here.
 -  I'm scared.

1676
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,370
- He ran as soon as he saw me.
 -  Jin Goo is here.

1677
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,120
Are you going to touch me?

1678
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,670
Kwang Soo is coming.

1679
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,660
(They rip her name tag.)

1680
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,760
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

1681
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,300
- Let's go!
 -  Chaeyoung!

1682
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,460
(You're late!)

1683
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,260
Did they rip your name tag?

1684
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,270
I got ripped.

1685
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,070
Chaeyoung abandoned me.

1686
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,800
I ripped It. I ripped it!

1687
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:06,740
I'm sorry, Sana.

1688
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,470
I am sorry.

1689
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,700
Sana is out.

1690
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,530
- They're so quick.
 -  It's all right, Sana.

1691
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,570
(Sana was the cabbage.)

1692
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,690
Sana is out.

1693
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,630
(Oh my gosh!)

1694
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:22,870
Why?

1695
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,460
- Sana, you were cabbage, right?
 -  There was only one cabbage.

1696
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,560
There was only one cabbage. Kimchijjigae.

1697
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,840
Watch out for chilli, garlic and pork.

1698
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,470
Cabbage.

1699
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,460
We got just one.

1700
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,440
- We got Sana.
 -  Chilli, garlic and pork.

1701
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,260
(White Team gets cabbage.)

1702
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,040
Okay. Let's get more.

1703
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,330
They're here.

1704
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:45,670
Yes. That's it!

1705
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:47,970
Don't run.

1706
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,330
- What are you?
 -  I am the Pepper Bomb.

1707
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,130
- I know.
 -  I really am the Pepper Bomb.

1708
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,220
- I know that.
 -  I'm really the Pepper Bomb.

1709
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,990
- I'm the Pepper Bomb.
 -  Give it to me. I'm sorry.

1710
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:57,460
I'm serious.

1711
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,560
Don't do it. Don't.

1712
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,570
I am the Pepper Bomb.

1713
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,180
(She lies down on the floor to guard her name tag.)

1714
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,270
- Okay.
 -  Look at the girls.

1715
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,510
(Getting up)

1716
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,850
These girls are unbelievable.

1717
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,980
- Gosh.
 -  They are unbelievable.

1718
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,100
There.

1719
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,090
(They must rip TWICE's name tags.)

1720
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,160
Run.

1721
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,630
- Tzuyu, rip their name tags.
 -  We have to rip them.

1722
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,990
- Tzuyu, hurry up.
 -  Tzuyu!

1723
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,140
No!

1724
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,130
- Tzuyu.
 -  Rip it.

1725
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,190
Catch her.

1726
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,470
- Tzuyu.
 -  Let's get it over with.

1727
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,960
(She appeals to him by acting cute.)

1728
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,970
Oh, gosh!

1729
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,930
- Please grab her.
 -  No!

1730
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,270
No!

1731
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,370
(It's a mess.)

1732
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:37,930
- We have to rip her name tag.
 -  Hold on.

1733
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,130
Please hold me.

1734
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,860
- Oh, gosh.
 -  It's okay.

1735
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,130
(Jin Goo comes to help.)

1736
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,300
(What?)

1737
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,630
(These girls used to be...)

1738
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,040
(very elegant.)

1739
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,560
(They are brawling fiercely.)

1740
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,460
(They are so persistent.)

1741
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,470
(They are tough.)

1742
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,470
(I'm not used to seeing them like this.)

1743
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,370
Move.

1744
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:06,990
- I will do it.
 -  Rip it.

1745
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,570
(Momo is cleaning the floor with her body.)

1746
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,310
(They scare me.)

1747
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,060
- Rip it!
 -  I am sorry.

1748
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,130
No. No.

1749
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,860
(While Jin Goo hesitates, someone else rips her name tag.)

1750
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,790
(Tzuyu ripped it!)

1751
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,920
I got it!

1752
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,460
(He's shocked.)

1753
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,700
I got Nayeon's.

1754
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,030
(Momo is out.)

1755
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,460
I got Nayeon's.

1756
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,230
- I got Nayeon's, too.
 -  Her tag got ripped.

1757
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,630
- Look at her hair.
 -  Are you okay?

1758
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,960
- I will take this.
 -  No.

1759
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,160
(It's stuck on her hair!)

1760
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,870
It's still on me, right?

1761
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,000
- It didn't end yet.
 -  I am sorry.

1762
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,800
Aren't I still okay?

1763
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,890
Momo is out.

1764
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,730
(They get green onions.)

1765
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:44,990
Oh, dear.

1766
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,160
(They can complete jeyukbokkeum and dwenjangjjigae as well.)

1767
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,470
- White Team got green onions.
 -  This is ridiculous.

1768
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,740
Green onions.

1769
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,460
We got two ingredients.

1770
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,940
(White Team is winning!)

1771
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,040
Did I die?

1772
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,900
Am I still alive? Yes!

1773
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,040
I'm alive, right?

1774
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,560
(Thanks to the name tag on her hair, she's still safe.)

1775
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,640
It doesn't hurt at all.

1776
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,200
Isn't it okay to move around like this?

1777
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,040
(What?)

1778
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,400
We need milk and...

1779
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,730
- bacon.
 -  We need bacon for carbonara.

1780
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,310
(Blue Team needs to work harder!)

1781
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,370
Oh my gosh.

1782
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,070
Don't do this to me.

1783
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,570
- I am not the only one.
 -  Don't do this to me.

1784
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:25,700
I think Jin Goo is the Pepper Bomb.

1785
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,440
I am the Pepper Bomb.

1786
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,760
I'm the Pepper Bomb, too.

1787
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,860
(Everyone claims to be the Pepper Bomb!)

1788
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,140
I am the Pepper Bomb.

1789
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,340
I'm the Pepper Bomb.

1790
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,270
I am the Pepper Bomb.

1791
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,130
(Let's see.)

1792
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,300
It's here.

1793
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,530
(They already know that the Pepper Bomb is a man.)

1794
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,370
Blue Team's Pepper Bomb is a Running Man member.

1795
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,740
(Then Chaeyoung is not the Pepper Bomb!)

1796
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,770
Come here, Chaeyoung.

1797
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,560
It's dangerous.

1798
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,030
(White Team traps them.)

1799
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:54,460
(Their target is Chaeyoung.)

1800
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,470
No.

1801
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,030
(Jae Seok tries his best to guard Chaeyoung.)

1802
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,190
- No.
 -  Get out.

1803
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,160
- Rip her name tag.
 -  I am the Pepper Bomb.

1804
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,160
- No.
 -  Let go.

1805
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,730
- I am the Pepper Bomb.
 -  Run, Chaeyoung!

1806
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,170
(Chaeyoung is in danger!)

1807
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,470
(Tzuyu tries to make a bold attack.)

1808
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:12,740
Run, Chaeyoung.

1809
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,740
(Did she suddenly change her target?)

1810
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,010
- No!
 -  No!

1811
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,950
It's not him!

1812
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,140
- No!
 -  No!

1813
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,760
It's not him!

1814
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,700
(Jae Seok was the Pepper Bomb of Blue Team!)

1815
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,360
(Jae Seok is out and the race is over.)

1816
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,440
It's over.

1817
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,830
He's the Pepper Bomb.

1818
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,360
(How did this happen?)

1819
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,460
What happened?

1820
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,570
- What happened?
 -  How did this happen?

1821
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,060
(Jae Seok feels sorry.)

1822
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,140
Tzuyu.

1823
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:49,470
(She didn't know Jae Seok was the Pepper Bomb.)

1824
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,460
- But...
 -  It's better that Jae Seok gets it.

1825
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,840
(1 hour ago during Blue Team's strategy meeting)

1826
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,630
- Me?
 -  They might...

1827
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,930
- expect it's you. That's why.
 -  They might expect it.

1828
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,600
- I'll be the Pepper Bomb then.
 -  You do it.

1829
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,590
Jae Seok is out.

1830
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,700
- What?
 -  What?

1831
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,330
- Jae Seok is out?
 -  Jae Seok?

1832
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,720
- Out?
 -  Is Jae Seok out?

1833
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,800
So did we win?

1834
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,560
Did they really lose?

1835
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,460
(Screaming)

1836
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,140
(Blue Team is so excited after hearing their unexpected victory.)

1837
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,100
This is amazing!

1838
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,170
(This is the power of the Pepper Bomb!)

1839
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,340
Who ripped his name tag?

1840
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,160
- Yes. We won!
 -  It's a miracle.

1841
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,290
- We won!
 -  What is this?

1842
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,530
- Did we lose? Just like that?
 -  Look.

1843
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:32,990
I told her to rip Chaeyoung but she ripped Jae Seok.

1844
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:35,900
- But no one...
 -  I thought it was Kwang Soo.

1845
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,240
Jong Kook. Kwang Soo is the Pepper Bomb. It's Kwang Soo.

1846
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,570
Kwang Soo is the Pepper Bomb.

1847
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:43,740
Blue Team's Pepper Bomb...

1848
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,100
(As they found hints, they all guessed the Pepper Bomb...)

1849
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,670
(to be Kwang Soo.)

1850
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,240
(It's surely Kwang Soo.)

1851
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,470
Should we destroy this?

1852
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,290
- But this happened because...
 -  Tzuyu can run really fast.

1853
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,960
Tzuyu is a really good runner.

1854
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,840
But it can't be helped.

1855
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,330
Let's go.

1856
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:04,430
(Blue Team is the winner of Dangerous Recipe.)

1857
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,830
- That's all right.
 -  It's okay.

1858
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,870
Kwang Soo! We made it!

1859
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,340
We did it, Kwang Soo.

1860
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,880
- We won.
 -  Who ripped your name tag?

1861
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,920
Who ripped it? Who?

1862
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,170
Was it Tzuyu?

1863
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,400
(White Team has lost. Blue Team has won.)

1864
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,030
(The truly dangerous penalty will be revealed.)

1865
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,790
Prepare some dishes for the White Team.

1866
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,280
- How will they eat that?
 -  Blue Team members, come here.

1867
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,630
- Amazing. This is today's penalty.
 -  Dangerous Meal.

1868
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:36,270
I'm so glad that I don't have to eat this.

1869
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,470
As soon as they open that, they will not want to eat it.

1870
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,770
In 1, 2, 3.

1871
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,030
(What a smell!)

1872
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,460
- What is that smell?
 -  What are those?

1873
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,530
- What is this?
 -  I'll explain.

1874
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,470
(6 different dishes that taste strong but are good for your body)

1875
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,260
- What is that smell?
 -  What are those?

1876
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,200
- What is this?
 -  I'll explain.

1877
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,800
There's tofu inside.

1878
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,530
I can see it, too.

1879
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,960
They even prepared separate dishes for us.

1880
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,790
- Is that the stinky tofu?
 -  No, it's not.

1881
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:06,330
- Aren't they eggs? Duck eggs.
 -  They are duck eggs.

1882
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:09,520
- They are fermented.
 -  Why would you ferment duck eggs?

1883
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,120
(I can't take this smell.)

1884
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,660
- Fermented skate. Sophora root tea.
 -  Sophora root tea.

1885
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,140
I'll drink Sophora root tea.

1886
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:17,070
- We also have spicy hairtail.
 -  Where's the stinky tofu?

1887
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,760
(It's so spicy it will burn your mouth.)

1888
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,890
- It must be really sour.
 -  Do I need to eat those?

1889
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,130
- They are delicious dishes.
 -  Can I start eating first?

1890
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,690
- Yes.
 -  Okay. Get ready.

1891
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:27,340
In 1, 2, 3.

1892
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,060
- Should I eat now?
 -  Yes.

1893
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,460
- I like fermented skate.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1894
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,770
(Ji Hyo, who likes fermented skate, eats first.)

1895
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,040
Wow, this one's strong.

1896
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,640
It seems strong.

1897
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,200
- Should I eat now?
 -  Yes.

1898
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,430
(Jong Kook drinks the tea at once.)

1899
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:48,110
- Wow, this one's strong.
 -  It is.

1900
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,010
Gosh.

1901
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,330
(Jin Goo tries the stinky tofu.)

1902
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,970
- It's tasty.
 -  How does it taste?

1903
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,860
(This stinky tofu really stinks.)

1904
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:03,230
(The members of TWICE try sophora root tea and spicy hairtail.)

1905
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,700
How does it taste? Is it okay?

1906
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,030
(The smell of fermented skate catches her off-guard.)

1907
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,740
- Is it ham?
 -  Ouch, my nose.

1908
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,840
- What's the problem? Does it hurt?
 -  My nose...

1909
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,620
- My nose hurts.
 -  Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

1910
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,570
- Look at Ji Hyo.
 -  Oh, my nose. Gosh.

1911
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,700
- What happened?
 -  What is this? It looks delicious.

1912
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,130
My gosh, the smell. No, Jong Kook. No.

1913
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,730
- No.
 -  Come to think of it, I'm eating...

1914
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,670
- It's really delicious.
 -  This is...

1915
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,200
- The taste is strong.
 -  It's really strong.

1916
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,260
Jin Goo, thank you for joining us despite your busy schedule.

1917
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,360
And thank you to all the members of TWICE for joining us. Thank you all.

1918
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,770
(We'd like to thank Yeo Jin Goo and TWICE for joining us.)

(Cho Jin Woong)

1921
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,000
(Kwon Yul, Han Ye Ri)

1922
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,330
(They only have 8 hours.)

1923
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:02,860
(They've become fugitives due to a moment's choice.)

1924
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,160
(Run away from the chaser and grab 7,000 dollars.)

1925
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,690
(Run away as fast as you can or chase them by any means.)

1926
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,460
(It's a race between the hunters and fugitives.)

1927
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,840
They got them all.

1928
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,470
