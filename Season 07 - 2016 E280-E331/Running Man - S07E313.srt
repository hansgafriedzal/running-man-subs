1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,700
(At a cafe in Hannam-dong)

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,000
(Nice music is playing here.)

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,630
(Who are these beautiful women listening to music?)

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,850
Look at Kwang Soo. He's all dressed up again.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,490
- Hello.
 -  Are you going somewhere?

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,530
Why?

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,840
- Are you a choir member?
 -  What are you talking about?

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,100
(His suit has the same colour of pigeon, a symbol of peace.)

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,230
What happened to your hair? It looks awful.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,700
Why did you part your hair like that?

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,380
- Please don't do that.
 -  What?

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,190
- You look like Ahn Jae Wook.
 -  Right, in "Star in My Heart".

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,850
You also look like the Superman from Dr Slump.

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,590
(Jong Kook perfectly resembles the cartoon character.)

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,820
My goodness.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,660
- Hello, everyone.
 -  Hi.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,130
- We invited six beautiful ladies.
 -  Really?

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,360
- You'll play with them today.
 -  Yes!

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
It's because Ji Hyo isn't here today.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,100
- That is right.
 -  Ji Hyo isn't here.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,150
That means one of us will be her partner today.

22
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,600
Right. One of us will be unlucky.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,730
You'll become a couple with one of them.

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,860
- Really?
 -  So we'll meet our destiny.

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,470
(Where are the members' partners?)

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,790
(They're right above them.)

27
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,330
(They came early and each chose music they like.)

28
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,980
(Those who choose the same music will become a couple.)

29
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,880
- That's not easy.
 -  We must have same taste, then.

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,920
- We'll play the music they chose.
 -  Okay.

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,900
If they play "Hot Issue", you know who chose the song.

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,060
It's Ji Hyo, then.

33
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,320
- I'm nervous.
 -  Please, listen carefully.

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,500
They chose their favourite songs.

35
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,230
(This song?)

36
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,260
- I got it.
 -  It's Ji Hyo.

37
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
- It must be Ji Hyo.
 -  I think I know...

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,460
- who chose this one.
 -  It is Ji Hyo.

39
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,930
- Really?
 -  That's right.

40
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,560
- Why?
 -  It can only be Ji Hyo.

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,700
I'm sure Ji Hyo chose this song.

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,430
- Young people don't know this song.
 -  Ji Hyo thinks this song suits her.

43
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,200
(Who is this beautiful girl?)

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,030
- It can't be A Joong.
 -  It can't be.

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,800
- The next one.
 -  Okay.

46
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,330
("Seoul Life" by Rose Motel)

47
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,230
- I don't know who chose this.
 -  I will choose this one.

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,930
I like this one.

49
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,010
The one who chose this song must be on the older side.

50
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,560
This is...

51
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,760
- Who chose this song must be old.
 -  But the thing is,

52
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,300
young idol singers might listen to these songs more.

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,930
I'll play the next song.

54
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,660
Is there any hip-hop music?

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,030
("Twinkle" by TTS)

56
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,700
(Haha is excited.)

57
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,130
- This is a little...
 -  I'm sure it's a trap.

58
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,930
- It's a trap.
 -  I like TTS.

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,130
- I like it.
 -  This is a good one.

60
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,900
I think we should choose old songs.

61
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,200
This is hard...

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,860
because this song was released about 3 to 4 years ago.

63
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,200
Isn't it someone who pretends to be young?

64
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,330
I think we must listen to all the songs to figure it out.

65
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,630
Maybe "Hot Issue" is really there.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,730
("I Need a Girl" by Taeyang)

67
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,900
- Taeyang?
 -  It's Taeyang.

68
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,730
Taeyang?

69
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,960
This song is great.

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,890
- I'm sure an idol chose this.
 -  It's a nice song.

71
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm sure there's a twist. Don't be fooled.

72
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,720
Girl group members like Taeyang.

73
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,130
- This song would be a good choice.
 -  No.

74
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,630
(There must be hidden traps.)

75
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,700
I'll play the next song.

76
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,060
("Romantic Cat" by Cherry Filter)

77
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,460
- This is my favourite!
 -  I love this song.

78
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,160
- I love "Romantic Cat".
 -  I'm sure...

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,830
there are three traps Ji Hyo laid.

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,030
This feels like Ji Hyo's.

81
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,830
(Do I look like Ji Hyo?)

82
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,000
She likes this one.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
(Do I look like Ji Hyo?)

84
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,800
Let me play the last song.

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,190
- There are so many traps.
 -  This is so confusing.

86
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,260
It's already the last song?

87
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,160
This is a bright song.

88
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,700
It's very vibrant. Don't you think someone cute chose this?

89
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,360
This is music for clubs.

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
But I feel like it's an old lady who chose this one.

91
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,630
- I think so, too.
 -  This is so old.

92
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,300
I want "Seoul Life".

93
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,660
I want it, too.

94
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,060
- I was going to choose it, too.
 -  I like "Seoul Life".

95
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,530
- I want it.
 -  I want "Seoul Life".

96
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,160
I was also going to choose "Seoul Life".

97
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You all can choose the same one.

98
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,000
- Right.
 -  If that's your taste, it's okay.

99
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,550
I'll choose "Seoul Life".

100
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,780
Why?

101
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,400
Why does everyone want that song?

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,430
- I like that song.
 -  Gosh!

103
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,300
I think you all are trying hard not to be Ji Hyo's partner.

104
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,030
- How could you...
 -  If it's not her, it's all good.

105
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,300
Everyone here is okay if it's not Ji Hyo.

106
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,130
- It's time to make a decision.
 -  Please choose one song.

107
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,270
- "Seoul Life".
 -  "Seoul Life".

108
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,870
I want "I Need a Girl".

109
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,300
I will choose "Romantic Cat".

110
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,190
- I want "Seoul Life".
 -  Again?

111
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,600
- Too many competitions.
 -  So you all don't want Ji Hyo.

112
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,960
Good.

113
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,760
Okay. Then,

114
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,030
the ladies who chose "I Need a Girl"...

115
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,350
and "Beautiful Girl" will come out first.

116
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,760
- Oh, my.
 -  There they are.

117
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
They are idol group members.

118
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,420
- My goodness.
 -  I knew it.

119
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,600
She's pretty.

120
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,030
(How can my taste be the same with an idol member?)

121
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,160
(Who are these beautiful Running Women?)

122
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,220
Gosh, Mi Joo! Mi Joo is here.

123
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,600
- It's Mi Joo.
 -  Se Jeong is here.

124
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,960
(Se Jeong is a member of a famous idol group, Gugudan.)

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
(Beautiful Mi Joo of Lovelyz is here as well.)

126
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,330
- Mi Joo is here.
 -  Come again?

127
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,430
- What?
 -  It's Mi Joo!

128
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,090
- Se Jeong is here!
 -  I like Mi Joo!

129
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,570
- You are...
 -  I chose the wrong song.

130
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,760
So idol group members are here!

131
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,100
- My goodness.
 -  They are here!

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,760
- What is this?
 -  It's good.

133
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,300
They chose "Beautiful Girl" and "I Need a Girl".

134
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
- Great.
 -  They chose the songs.

135
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,460
I was going to choose "Beautiful Girl".

136
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,410
We'll listen to "Beautiful Girl" again,

137
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,460
and the one who chose it will go back to the second floor.

138
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,030
- I was going to choose that.
 -  All right.

139
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,400
- I never knew you'd come here.
 -  They're so bright.

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,950
Mi Joo is so pretty. It's Mi Joo.

141
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,590
- Is she going up again?
 -  No!

142
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,500
- Here comes Se Jeong.
 -  This is bad.

143
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,660
I met Se Jeong on Saturday.

144
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,160
- Hello.
 -  She's Jae Seok's partner.

145
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,330
Hello.

146
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,320
Se Jeong, you should've chosen "One Man".

147
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
(That was a nice joke.)

148
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,130
You two will become a couple.

149
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,330
(Jae Seok and Se Jeong are a couple.)

150
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,430
- Did you choose the same song?
 -  Yes.

151
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,330
Why did you choose this song?

152
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,790
I was on "Kpop Star 2" before,

153
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,630
and I sang this song there.

154
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,930
I see.

155
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,810
(She's cute.)

156
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,900
(This girl has become a star now.)

157
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,670
- But...
 -  I missed it, gosh.

158
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,530
The lady who chose "Seoul Life" is coming next.

159
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,630
Now I understand how things are going today.

160
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,680
Those who chose "Seoul Life" and "Mi Mi Mi" will come down.

161
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,130
I want to see who chose "Mi Mi Mi".

162
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,500
- Let's invite them.
 -  Okay.

163
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,400
(They chose "Seoul Life" to avoid being a couple with Ji Hyo.)

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Gosh.

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,880
- Wait.
 -  Who is it?

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,760
They are totally different from the first two.

167
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,160
She's Jae Suk.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
- It's Jae Suk.
 -  Gosh.

169
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,230
- Jae Suk!
 -  Hello.

170
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,400
- Long time no see.
 -  One of them chose "Seoul Life?

171
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,860
Ji Hyo, you chose "Seoul Life"?

172
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,230
- Are you serious?
 -  You chose it?

173
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,000
- Gosh.
 -  I know you did.

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
(Guess who chose "Seoul Life".)

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,670
- Hello, Jae Suk.
 -  Jae Suk!

176
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,700
- They're like my family.
 -  Who chose "Romantic Cat"?

177
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,660
I love this song, though.

178
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,060
This is a great song.

179
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,660
Great!

180
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,630
("Seoul Life" is Jae Suk's choice.)

181
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,660
Then,

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,280
did Ji Hyo choose "Mi Mi Mi"?

183
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,230
- Hello.
 -  Hello, Jae Suk!

184
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,460
- It's been long.
 -  She's cute.

185
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
- Anyway, Jae Suk...
 -  What is this?

186
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,760
- is Jong Kook's sister-in-law.
 -  Our Jae Suk.

187
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,100
She and Soo Ae are like sisters.

188
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
Jong Kook, Soo Ae is doing well.

189
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,660
- Are you okay?
 -  I don't know.

190
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,800
Good.

191
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,100
I wanted to console him.

192
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,360
Did he get dumped? They didn't even have a date.

193
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,700
- Did she dump him?
 -  Is it already over?

194
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,730
Soo Ae never considered it.

195
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
Was it just for the show?

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
(I'm not smiling inside.)

197
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,330
She made him have a crush on her.

198
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,630
The one I will choose is...

199
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,270
Hey, you.

200
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,300
Me?

201
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,860
Hey, think about it one more time.

202
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,330
(Hey, think about it one more time.)

203
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,560
We already were in the same team before. Think about it again.

204
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,140
- I want Mi Joo.
 -  Come here, you brat.

205
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,830
- Wait a minute.
 -  Goodness.

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,760
We'll be the winner in the end.

207
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,360
Now, those who chose...

208
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,000
"Romantic Cat" and "Twinkle" will come out.

209
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,650
"Romantic Cat" and "Twinkle".

210
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,760
Please, come down.

211
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,990
Who are you?

212
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,660
(Who are you?)

213
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,100
Who is it?

214
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,400
(Who are these beautiful ladies?)

215
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
- She's Tuna Lady.
 -  Tuna Lady is here!

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,890
- Really?
 -  Tuna Lady!

217
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,090
- Tuna Lady is here!
 -  Moon Sook is here.

218
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,530
- My goodness!
 -  Tuna Lady!

219
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,100
- Gosh.
 -  Moon Sook is here!

220
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,290
- Hello!
 -  That's Moon Sook!

221
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,000
(Noh Sa Yeon and Ahn Moon Sook)

222
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,660
- Tuna Lady.
 -  Tuna Lady is here!

223
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,450
She's back because it's summer.

224
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,760
- Moon Sook is here, too.
 -  Hello, Moon Sook.

225
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,230
They chose "Twinkle" and "Romantic Cat".

226
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,520
I can't really say who's good and who's bad.

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
Let's see...

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,630
if Sa Yeon is a romantic tuna.

229
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,500
(Who chose "Romantic Cat"?)

230
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
I think it's Moon Sook.

231
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,830
- They're not going up.
 -  Is it Moon Sook?

232
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,670
Where are you going?

233
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,650
(Where are you going?)

234
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,460
- No one wants Seok Jin.
 -  They both are...

235
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,000
- Please, hold on.
 -  Wait.

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,930
They don't want Seok Jin.

237
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,100
Where are you going?

238
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,330
(We don't want unlucky Seok Jin.)

239
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,060
- They don't want Seok Jin, either.
 -  They went back up.

240
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,760
- I do understand them, though.
 -  Right.

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
I think...

242
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,930
She's coming back down.

243
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,430
It's Moon Sook.

244
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,330
(Moon Sook chose "Romantic Cat".)

245
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,350
(They have the same taste in music.)

246
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,920
- Ahn Moon Sook!
 -  Yes!

247
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,710
- You look so pretty today.
 -  You look beautiful.

248
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,060
You look beautiful today.

249
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,000
- You look lovely.
 -  That's right.

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,230
- She does look beautiful.
 -  You look gorgeous today.

251
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,040
It's been five years since I joined you last time.

252
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,800
Yes, I remember. It was during the summer.

253
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,030
And it was summer, just like today.

254
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,060
It's also funny that my life hasn't changed at all since then.

255
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,730
(Her life hasn't changed a bit for the last 5 years.)

256
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,080
- It has been the same.
 -  It hasn't changed at all.

257
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,330
And I'm sick of this man, too.

258
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,030
(She's already tired of seeing Seok Jin.)

259
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,860
(Moon Sook and Seok Jin will play together today.)

260
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,310
You made me dress up. You should match me with a single man.

261
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,130
Those guys are not as nice as you think.

262
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,130
Please bring them down.

263
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,400
(The remaining women have chosen one of their belongings.)

264
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,530
(The man who picks them will become their partners.)

265
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,500
- They are here. Can you open it?
 -  Okay.

266
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,530
What are they?

267
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,620
There is a fan. A small fan.

268
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,530
These socks seem worn out.

269
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't idol singers wear these often?

270
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,430
They also use small fans.

271
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,030
Please choose one each.

272
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,530
- I'll be the last to choose.
 -  Okay.

273
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,030
- I'm not choosing the earrings.
 -  You know how unlucky I am.

274
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,030
Here.

275
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,400
- He got a good one.
 -  Do you like it, Jong Kook?

276
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,530
Can I have the other one?

277
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,430
- Congratulations.
 -  Why did you give this to me?

278
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,330
- Those might be Sa Yeon's.
 -  We don't have time.

279
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,630
- You're wasting time.
 -  Why did you give these?

280
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,730
- She sprayed perfume.
 -  Hurry up.

281
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,760
Come on.

282
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,700
(Who are the owners of these three different objects?)

283
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,630
Ladies, please come down

284
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,860
Sa Yeon is wearing her earrings.

285
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,760
- That's a relief.
 -  Hello.

286
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,960
- Hello.
 -  She's wearing earrings.

287
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,800
- Welcome.
 -  We've been waiting for you.

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,130
They are all wearing earrings.

289
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm wearing earrings, too.

290
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,200
We have Mi Joo, Ji Hyo...

291
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,230
and Tuna Lady.

292
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,630
- Please show them what you chose.
 -  Okay.

293
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,100
- One, two, three.
 -  One, two, three.

294
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,100
All right. Who's the owner of this small fan?

295
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,710
(It's so difficult to read their faces.)

296
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,860
All right. Who's the owner...

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
of this small fan?

298
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,900
- Please stand beside him.
 -  Yes!

299
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,130
(Screaming in happiness)

300
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,860
(It's the Tuna Lady.)

301
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,000
- Yes. Yes, I got him.
 -  It's so amazing.

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,780
- No way.
 -  It's really amazing.

303
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,710
- They are the best couple.
 -  What an amazing couple.

304
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,000
Wow, what a match.

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,160
- They're the final boss for today.
 -  They're the best couple at games.

306
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,700
- You should be smiling, Jong Kook.
 -  I am.

307
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,630
- I am smiling.
 -  You're faking it.

308
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,860
All right. We have Kwang Soo and Gary left.

309
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,930
You must be looking forward.

310
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,700
If I get Ji Hyo...

311
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,400
- Why?
 -  I prefer someone else, too.

312
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
- She can have a different partner.
 -  I'm sure she feels the same way.

313
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,330
It would be unlucky if we were paired.

314
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,030
- That's right.
 -  I'm fine with Ji Hyo.

315
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,230
I don't care any more.

316
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,430
- All right.
 -  I'm not changing my opinion.

317
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
It just scares me.

318
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,200
We have earrings...

319
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,410
and a pair of socks.

320
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,160
Please stand next to the person who has your belongings.

321
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
One, two, three. Go.

322
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,260
(Go!)

323
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,430
- Ji Hyo is smiling strangely.
 -  Yes, she surely is.

324
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
- Gary!
 -  No!

325
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,300
- Why did I pick last?
 -  Calm down.

326
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,230
(Kwang Soo is touched to be paired with Mi Joo.)

327
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,780
- Gary. You must be happy. Right?
 -  Look at Kwang Soo.

328
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,130
- Kwang Soo seems really happy.
 -  He's so lucky today.

329
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,130
(Gary and Ji Hyo are a couple for today.)

330
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,420
- Gary.
 -  Yes?

331
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,300
Ji Hyo is so happy to be with you.

332
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,330
- Let's do well.
 -  Let's love again.

333
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,830
(Will the once Monday Couple rekindle their love?)

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,630
(Running Women are here to conquer.)

335
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,430
(Gather as many Running Balls as possible...)

336
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,230
(to have an advantage at the final race.)

337
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
Sa Yeon, I think this is the end of us.

338
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,700
(Women's Name Tag Elimination will be played for the first time ever.)

339
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,800
(Here comes the strong ladies.)

340
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,500
(Running Men versus Running Women)

341
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,800
We have a simple test for you to take...

342
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,330
before we move for the first game.

343
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,930
What is it?

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,710
- What's that?
 -  It's a punching machine.

345
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,930
- What is that?
 -  Is it a punching machine?

346
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,430
- It feels like I'm at an arcade.
 -  Okay!

347
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,430
Do you seriously want Mi Joo to punch that thing?

348
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,630
This is not a game for the ladies.

349
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,630
This is...

350
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,430
- You lost some weight, didn't you?
 -  Yes, I did.

351
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,900
- Do we have only one chance?
 -  You must hit the centre.

352
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
We all know that Ji Hyo always strikes first.

353
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
- That's right.
 -  Yes. She always strikes first.

354
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,700
She always strikes first.

355
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
- Really?
 -  Yes. She's really strong.

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,430
I feel nervous.

357
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,030
- Go, Ji Hyo.
 -  Why is she wearing pyjamas?

358
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,030
Just look at her.

359
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,160
(Her stance looks good.)

360
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,800
She knows how to hit.

361
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Shouldn't you take off your bracelet?

362
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,160
- Remember the good, old days.
 -  Get ready.

363
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,130
(Remember how you used to punch?)

364
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,600
- She knows how to punch.
 -  Go.

365
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,930
(She punches it.)

366
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
(Ji Hyo gives it a crushing blow.)

367
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
- That was a good punch.
 -  I hope it goes over 500 points.

368
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,860
- 500 points?
 -  Amazing.

369
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,700
498 points. That was a nice punch.

370
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,230
- Next.
 -  It's Mi Joo's turn.

371
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,030
- How should I punch?
 -  Mi Joo.

372
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,890
- Can she score 300 points?
 -  What are you doing?

373
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,230
- Gosh.
 -  What's wrong?

374
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,830
- What's wrong?
 -  It's tight around my shoulders.

375
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,900
- Her dress is not comfortable.
 -  I thought she was stretching.

376
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,360
- She seems strong.
 -  Don't grab your wrist.

377
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,550
- Cover your entire hand.
 -  It'll prevent it from twisting.

378
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,630
Take care of your Tuna Lady instead!

379
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,670
- Because Kwang Soo was...
 -  Why do you care about her?

380
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,830
- She has Kwang Soo.
 -  She could get hurt, that's why.

381
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,630
You're really strange.

382
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,930
- She won't hurt herself.
 -  Goodness.

383
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,960
- I'll do it now.
 -  Yes.

384
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Look at that punch.

385
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
(She gives it a good punch.)

386
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,600
- 420 points?
 -  The number keeps rising.

387
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,760
- Really?
 -  Amazing!

388
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,330
530 points?

389
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,830
(Although she's thin, she's quite strong.)

390
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,000
Although it seems like she didn't put in much force,

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,060
- she put her weight in it.
 -  She's been hiding her strength...

392
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,820
- She has been hiding it.
 -  because she's an idol singer.

393
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,360
I think she can score over 700 points.

394
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,860
- I'm nervous now.
 -  Sa Yeon.

395
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,960
- I thought it was 70 points.
 -  She can score over 700 points.

396
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,730
She's been hiding her ability.

397
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,430
Stop talking about Mi Joo.

398
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,330
- I'm sorry.
 -  Sa Yeon's mad.

399
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
(Glaring)

400
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,260
That was too much, Jae Seok.

401
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Good luck, Sa Yeon.

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,720
- You should apologise to her.
 -  Well, I...

403
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,130
Aim for the centre.

404
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,630
Just put your weight in.

405
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
(She slightly misses her punch.)

406
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,600
- She missed it.
 -  Let me try once more.

407
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,430
527 points?

408
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,930
She missed it and scored 527 points.

409
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,600
I missed.

410
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,330
You lost your grip while punching.

411
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,600
I did. Can I try one more time?

412
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,730
- I don't know if you can.
 -  I'm upset because of Mi Joo.

413
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,730
I'll punch one more time thinking about her.

414
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,160
- You can't.
 -  You only care about Mi Joo.

415
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
- It's all Mi Joo.
 -  All right. Just once.

416
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,910
When you punch, you should put all your weight in the punch.

417
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,500
If not, you'll slip.

418
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,700
That's it.

419
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,860
(Lady Tuna's powerful smash)

420
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,000
- That was a strong punch.
 -  I think it'll be over 700 points.

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,860
- That was really close.
 -  700 points?

422
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
It's 583 points.

423
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,510
- That was a nice punch.
 -  You did well.

424
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,630
The last punch was...

425
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,730
- Don't worry. It's nothing.
 -  Jae Suk is...

426
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,900
She is most likely to win.

427
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,230
- We played against her before.
 -  She can't be rivalled with anyone.

428
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,110
She can't be rivalled.

429
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,500
- You only need one hand.
 -  Jae Suk is really...

430
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,020
You should warm up more.

431
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,600
(That was a loud, powerful punch.)

432
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,630
(That's surely her whole-hearted punch.)

433
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,160
- What was that?
 -  Amazing!

434
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,530
(She scores 689 points.)

435
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,230
- 689 points?
 -  What is that score?

436
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,030
- What was that?
 -  Did I do well?

437
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,530
Yes, you were amazing.

438
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,960
You should warm up more.

439
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,930
(Look at that punch.)

440
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,930
(She's in a different league.)

441
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,130
- Did you see that swing?
 -  It was just...

442
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,760
She put all her weight in it.

443
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,500
- She hit the bull's-eye.
 -  She put her weight in.

444
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,500
- It's so clear.
 -  You should punch with your body.

445
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,790
She should be playing at the Olympics!

446
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,720
- You shouldn't punch like this.
 -  She shouldn't be here.

447
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,210
- Thank you.
 -  Jae Suk, you should be in Rio.

448
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,690
But our Se Jeong is really good at punching.

449
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,230
- Wait.
 -  It shouldn't be "our" Se Jeong.

450
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,160
You're in different teams.

451
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,260
You're friendly to everyone.

452
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,030
- You're so strange.
 -  No, I mean it. She is...

453
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,260
really good at punching.

454
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,400
- What are you talking about?
 -  Take care of your Tuna Lady first.

455
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,600
- Look, Se Jeong.
 -  Punch with your weight behind...

456
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
- your punch.
 -  Grab your hand like this...

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
- Go! Take care of your partner!
 -  Stand here, Se Jeong.

458
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,960
Jong Kook!

459
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,730
(You little jerk!)

460
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,000
Gosh. Today must be my unlucky day.

461
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
The fan makes her face look bigger!

462
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,600
(The fan is too small for her.)

463
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,030
It's your fault, Jong Kook.

464
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,330
It makes her face look bigger!

465
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,330
Sa Yeon, get under this fan.

466
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,900
Come under this big fan.

467
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,250
(This fan will surely make her face look small.)

468
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,100
Hey, stop it.

469
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,630
- We should treat her like a queen.
 -  Jong Kook.

470
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,160
Take good care of her.

471
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,370
- How could you use this fan?
 -  I was just being nice.

472
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,210
- It's really funny.
 -  Se Jeong.

473
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,200
- Can you do it now?
 -  Yes.

474
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,850
She looks weak.

475
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,870
My goodness.

476
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,420
Nice punch.

477
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,260
(Se Jeong's gives it a right hook.)

478
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,130
- 420 points?
 -  It's going higher than that.

479
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,160
- It's 500 points.
 -  She got 591 points.

480
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,630
That's good enough.

481
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,500
Here comes an ex-professional taekwondo player.

482
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,900
(Next is Moon Sook.)

483
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,330
- I'm looking forward to this.
 -  I'm nervous.

484
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,130
Moon Sook, punch like this.

485
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,870
This dress is really uncomfortable.

486
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,930
You can pull your dress up a bit.

487
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,060
- Wait.
 -  No. Not like that.

488
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,230
- Stop it, Moon Sook.
 -  What are you doing?

489
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,830
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,230
It's my dress. Why do you guys care?

491
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,800
- It's too much.
 -  Isn't this just okay?

492
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,610
- Her dress is quite long.
 -  This machine is little low.

493
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,700
(She punches it.)

494
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,870
(She gives it a powerful smash.)

495
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,600
- That was great.
 -  She used one hand.

496
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,030
- It's 553 points.
 -  That's really good.

497
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,370
Do you want to do it again?

498
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,370
We all expected this outcome.

499
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,200
Punching, posture and power... This game was for Jae Suk.

500
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,030
She knows how to punch.

501
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,330
I think she's stronger than some men.

502
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,230
(Jae Suk and Haha are first place.)

503
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,500
(Ji Hyo and Gary are last.)

504
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,870
All right, everyone. For the first game,

505
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,000
we'll play "Running Women's Arm Wrestle".

506
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,590
- You're playing against Jae Suk.
 -  I guess only the women play.

507
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,330
We divided you into several classes.

508
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,760
It doesn't make any sense.

509
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,720
You'll play against appropriate opponents.

510
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,250
- Go beat Se Jeong.
 -  But...

511
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,700
- Relax. It's okay to lose.
 -  Let's go.

512
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,380
She looks like she could be my daughter. I'm sorry.

513
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,000
- Jae Suk, let's go!
 -  Get ready.

514
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,130
- Let's have a good match.
 -  Haha is really annoying.

515
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,430
Get ready, everyone.

516
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,570
- She doesn't look so determined.
 -  That's it.

517
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,630
- Grab her.
 -  Gosh.

518
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,130
Just fall down, Se Jeong.

519
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,100
- Yes. You're doing nice. Good.
 -  It's a one-sided match.

520
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,760
(She screams and falls.)

521
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,160
(She sounds like a dolphin.)

522
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,330
Hey, Se Jeong.

523
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,030
- I feel guilty for winning this.
 -  That's was cruel.

524
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,430
- I'm sorry, Se Jeong.
 -  Were you excited?

525
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,500
I think you screamed in excitement.

526
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,630
(I screamed without knowing.)

527
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
- Oh well.
 -  It's so hot and tiring.

528
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,830
- I'm really tired.
 -  It was inevitable.

529
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,410
- There was nothing you could do.
 -  Next players are...

530
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,160
- Ji Hyo and Mi Joo.
 -  Go, Ji Hyo.

531
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Go, Mi Joo. Go.

532
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,900
Se Jeong should've played against these two.

533
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,590
Mi Joo, you only need to try once.

534
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,700
Ready.

535
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,060
- Go hard, Ji Hyo.
 -  Ji Hyo seems really relaxed.

536
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,060
Look at her relaxed face.

537
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,210
- This is quite...
 -  She's good.

538
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,000
Push, Mi Joo. Push if you can't pull.

539
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,430
How did Jae Suk do this so easily?

540
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,630
(Screaming)

541
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,230
(Mi Joo is out.)

542
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,810
She collapsed while screaming.

543
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,190
(I may have been like that, too.)

544
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,130
- Next.
 -  Let's go!

545
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,430
- Seriously, Gary...
 -  Ahn Moon Sook.

546
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,880
This is a big match.

547
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,430
- Let's go.
 -  You can do it!

548
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,160
(They start off by intimidating each other.)

549
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,300
This really is a big match.

550
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,560
It's almost the final.

551
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,160
- I can't predict the result.
 -  Let's go!

552
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,300
They are surprised by each other.

553
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,760
Ready...

554
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,830
(Moon Sook vs Sa Yeon)

555
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,680
Who's going to win?

556
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,990
As we expected,

557
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,370
- Push to your right.
 -  they are...

558
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,180
It's like a match between a dragon and a tiger.

559
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,300
It's intense.

560
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,000
Moon Sook! Attack inwards.

561
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,230
To the left.

562
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,300
Pull her.

563
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,230
(Moon Sook attempts to make a sudden attack.)

564
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,200
(How dare you?)

565
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,330
(Sa Yeon counterattacks.)

566
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,230
(Swift)

567
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,000
Pull her towards you!

568
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,630
(She successfully counterattacks.)

569
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,400
Pull her towards you!

570
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,060
(Sa Yeon wins.)

571
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,430
Drink some water.

572
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,800
(The match ends with Moon Sook on the floor.)

573
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,130
(I can't beat her at all.)

574
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,160
(The semi-final, Ji Hyo vs Sa Yeon)

575
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,430
- Hey, she even beat me.
 -  She is toying with Ji Hyo.

576
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,560
(Sa Yeon wins with just one move.)

577
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
(Tuna Lady is on a winning streak.)

578
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
She defeated all four.

579
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,130
Now, it's your turn.

580
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
(The final, Sa Yeon vs Jae Suk)

581
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,930
- Let's go.
 -  You can do it.

582
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,700
- Loosen your arm muscles.
 -  It's nice to use my power.

583
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
- Loosen up.
 -  That feels good.

584
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,730
(This is a true variety show.)

585
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,690
(A fair play is expected.)

586
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,870
Ready, set...

587
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,750
- I can feel their energy.
 -  Let's go.

588
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,760
(Startled)

589
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
I can feel her great power.

590
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,430
- She's surprised.
 -  Both of them are surprised.

591
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,160
Only the strong can recognise each other.

592
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
All they did was hold hands.

593
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,330
I've never seen them this nervous.

594
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,060
My heart is beating really fast.

595
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,830
She wasn't nervous when she was playing games with us.

596
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,000
- I'm sweating.
 -  I think Jae Suk will win.

597
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
(It's like a fight against themselves.)

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,320
- Ready...
 -  Go, Jae Suk.

599
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,730
This is the final.

600
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,490
- Set.
 -  They're the representatives.

601
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,630
Go.

602
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,960
(The match starts.)

603
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,830
- Sa Yeon isn't an easy one, either.
 -  Look at them.

604
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,300
Sa Yeon isn't easy at all.

605
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,370
It's a close match.

606
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,530
(Sa Yeon attacks first.)

607
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,300
(How can she attack in that posture?)

608
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,030
It's a close match.

609
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,560
(It was a swift move.)

610
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,960
(Jae Suk let go of Sa Yeon's hand while pretending to defend.)

611
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,190
(Jae Suk is the final winner.)

612
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,330
I'm so sorry.

613
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry, Sa Yeon.

614
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
(It's the historic moment when a new legend emerges.)

615
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,430
You're no longer the strong one.

616
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,060
I haven't seen her so embarrassed like that.

617
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,620
- After the game...
 -  Please move a little bit.

618
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,960
she got up and said,

619
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,300
"She is out of my league."

620
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,760
(Jae Suk is out of Sa Yeon's league.)

621
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,830
Jae Suk.

622
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,920
I didn't know she would lose.

623
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,100
You are the best.

624
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,060
(A new legend of variety shows is born.)

625
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,720
(Haha and Jae Suk are the winners.)

626
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,400
(Currently, Jae Suk and Haha have four Running Balls.)

627
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,900
The second game is called "Gather the Running Balls".

628
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,400
You will need to gather the Balls from different spots.

629
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,230
Try your best to gather as many Running Balls as you can.

630
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,820
- Okay.
 -  Let's go!

631
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,900
Let's go!

632
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,500
(She looks innocent and happy.)

633
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,410
(I'll try to get a lot of Running Balls.)

634
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,100
(There are five different spots where they can obtain the Balls.)

635
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,700
Guys, let's go to the snack bar.

636
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,260
- First...
 -  Wouldn't it be an eating game?

637
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,700
Although we might lose, we will be able to at least eat.

638
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,950
Let's nourish our bodies first.

639
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,790
- Let's just eat first.
 -  You're right.

640
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,100
- We're on a winning streak.
 -  Is the camera on now?

641
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,610
- It isn't, right?
 -  It is on.

642
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,490
- I brought some food.
 -  Go ahead and eat.

643
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,360
- Is the camera on? Then...
 -  You can eat freely.

644
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,430
(She is hungry.)

645
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,400
The camera's on, so go on and eat.

646
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,300
We're going to a snack bar in a few minutes.

647
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
- Really?
 -  Yes.

648
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,150
- Let's eat there too.
 -  First, we'll go to...

649
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,860
(Eating is always good news.)

650
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,400
They're so eager to eat.

651
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,100
They are different kinds of food.

652
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,600
I will eat with my guard down.

653
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,260
After eating some bread, you usually...

654
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,970
- crave tteokbokki.
 -  You're right.

655
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,160
Tteokbokki goes well with bread.

656
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,600
In order to eat tteokbokki...

657
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,400
Bread is just an appetiser, right?

658
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,670
- Eating is like a relay.
 -  It shouldn't stop midway.

659
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,130
- It's like handing over the baton.
 -  It's like breathing.

660
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,830
"Breathing"?

661
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,930
Appetite is like breathing.

662
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,500
Food is like a relay.

663
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,730
- I have good breathing skills.
 -  It's an endless marathon.

664
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,300
She has good breathing skills.

665
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,600
She has good breathing skills?

666
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,830
I really do.

667
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,560
Wow, this car runs nice and smoothly.

668
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,430
- Really?
 -  Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

669
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,100
(Laughing)

670
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,630
Moon Sook, I feel like I'm with my uncle.

671
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,690
(I feel like my uncle is my partner.)

672
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,100
- I got my license in 1988.
 -  In 1988?

673
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,530
(They depart from Itaewon to Dongdaemun-gu.)

674
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,660
- Let's go to the billiard hall.
 -  Okay.

675
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,200
- Let's go.
 -  Great.

676
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,400
I wonder what the mission will be.

677
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,230
It's been a long time since I came to one.

678
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,230
(What kind of mission will be given on this blue table?)

679
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,000
What kinds of food are you reminded of in a billiard hall?

680
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,180
- Jjajangmyeon.
 -  Jjajangmyeon.

681
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,500
Please bring two bowls of jjajangmyeon.

682
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,170
- Oh my goodness!
 -  Really?

683
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,950
- That's so great.
 -  I'm hungry.

684
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,960
The mission here is "Mouth Billiards".

685
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,930
You blow the ball to the other team's net.

686
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,500
The team to score two points first wins the game.

687
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,330
The winning team will obtain one Ball and jjajangmyeon.

688
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,830
I definitely got to eat jjajangmyeon.

689
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,850
- We'll start when you're ready.
 -  We are ready.

690
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,900
Ready...

691
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,160
(Dominate the game with your great lung capacity.)

692
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Set.

693
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,430
(Blowing)

694
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,800
(Wind blows from every direction.)

695
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,030
- We are almost there.
 -  Block it.

696
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,100
(Gary tosses it to the front.)

697
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,960
Oh no.

698
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
(The ball is headed towards Seok Jin's net.)

699
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,230
(Ji Hyo spots a chance to score.)

700
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,260
Go, Ji Hyo!

701
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,160
(Gary and Ji Hyo score a goal.)

702
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,530
That's Ji Hyo.

703
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,960
(She's the striker of Mouth Billiards.)

704
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,730
Do you have a long tongue?

705
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,430
How in the world...

706
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,830
are you so good at blowing?

707
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,900
(I can't blow for too long because it makes me dizzy.)

708
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,600
You said you would speak like a real lady.

709
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,730
- It's not important any more.
 -  Is it not?

710
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,730
(Nothing is more important than winning.)

711
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,550
- All right.
 -  Get ready.

712
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,560
Let's go.

713
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,800
(The game restarts.)

714
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,430
Good.

715
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,630
(Spitting)

716
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,060
Come on, Moon Sook.

717
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,400
(She aggressively attacks by spitting and shoving her face in.)

718
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,930
- Attack.
 -  Kiss him!

719
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,430
(You provoked a sleeping lioness.)

720
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,130
Score it!

721
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,510
(Blowing)

722
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,130
Come on, Gary. Don't back off.

723
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,930
(Startled)

724
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,730
Moon Sook!

725
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,260
Why don't you just kiss him?

726
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,700
(The other teams enter.)

727
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,500
(Their faces are so close to each other.)

728
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Gosh, what are they doing?

729
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,600
It looks somewhat erotic.

730
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,730
Erotic?

731
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,900
(Gary makes a long distance shoot.)

732
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,660
Defend.

733
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,900
(Seok Jin gets a chance right after the crisis.)

734
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,930
(She quickly blows.)

735
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,230
(Ji Hyo's surprise attack leads to a winning goal.)

736
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,260
(Seok Jin and Moon Sook score 0, Gary and Ji Hyo score 2.)

737
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,430
(She is at a loss for words.)

738
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,110
It was awesome.

739
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,850
- Ji Hyo, that was great.
 -  She's sweating.

740
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,500
Congratulations.

741
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,600
- Jjajangmyeon...
 -  Let's give them jjajangmyeon.

742
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,430
(The winners are blessed with jjajangmyeon.)

743
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,660
It smells great.

744
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Jjajangmyeon always goes well with billiards.

745
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,260
(Monday Couple starts nice and smoothly.)

746
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
(Jae Seok, Se Jeong, Kwang Soo and Mi Joo head to the snack bar.)

747
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,130
Sorry, but why don't you go to another spot?

748
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,360
Mi Joo, this is the only team that we can compete with.

749
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,730
I think that's right.

750
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,630
Usually, Haha is quite weak,

751
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,300
but not today because he is teamed with Jae Suk.

752
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,700
She is really strong.

753
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,900
So this team is the easiest to win against.

754
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,200
- We...
 -  Oh, here we are.

755
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,130
- This is the place.
 -  Se Jeong, get in quickly.

756
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,240
Okay.

757
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,010
You guys come in later.

758
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,760
- Jae Seok.
 -  I want to get in.

759
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,500
- Hello.
 -  Se Jeong, grab a seat.

760
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,270
Sit down and brace yourself.

761
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,560
- We are now...
 -  I guess we'll eat something.

762
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,930
The mission you have to complete here is...

763
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,040
- "Exercise and Tteokbokki".
 -  "Exercise and Tteokbokki"?

764
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,730
Move the tteokbokki...

765
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,060
to your partner's dish using the hand grip chopsticks.

766
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,430
Then the partner has to eat it using the fork dumbbell.

767
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,840
How many kilogrammes will it weigh? That's...

768
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
Do you think you can do that, Kwang Soo?

769
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,430
- Wow, this is...
 -  Oh, this looks heavy.

770
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,590
(Which team will have the honour of being the weakest?)

771
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,730
Ready, start.

772
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,730
Should I use only one hand?

773
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,100
- Yes.
 -  It's not easy to pick them up.

774
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,500
Kwang Soo.

775
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,930
These chopsticks are really hard to use.

776
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,700
(She enjoys the tteokbokki.)

777
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,030
(She is eating well.)

778
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,260
- It's hard.
 -  Help yourself.

779
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,730
- I'm hungry, Kwang Soo.
 -  This is hard.

780
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,930
Goodness.

781
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,130
- Yes?
 -  Why is this so hard?

782
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,860
(Frustrated)

783
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
(Struggling)

784
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,730
(It drops again.)

785
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,900
Help yourself.

786
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,330
- I'm so hungry.
 -  Here you go.

787
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,490
Goodness.

788
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,070
- Here you go.
 -  I know how to pick it up now.

789
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,100
All right!

790
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,900
It's spicy.

791
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,860
No, it's not spicy at all.

792
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,710
- Goodness.
 -  Just swallow them.

793
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,630
- You must really like tteokbokki.
 -  I do.

794
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,800
(Se Jeong must've been very hungry.)

795
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,630
Mi Joo, we have to beat them.

796
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,000
(The spiciness is catching up to her.)

797
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
Se Jeong, we need to win.

798
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,240
- It's too spicy.
 -  Just put it in your mouth.

799
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,300
It's not spicy.

800
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,400
(The game is about to end.)

801
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,630
Mi Joo, we don't have much time. Hurry up.

802
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,030
(Which team will be the winner?)

803
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,300
- Stop.
 -  Gosh, time's up.

804
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,700
How many pieces did you eat?

805
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,830
Mi Joo ate 7 and Se Jeong ate 8 pieces.

806
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,100
Jae Seok's team wins.

807
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,600
Jae Seok and Se Jeong obtain one Running Ball.

808
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,830
How many more did they eat?

809
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,850
(They lost by just one piece.)

810
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,330
It's spicy but delicious.

811
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,370
(The winner is given the chance to try cheese tteokbokki.)

812
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,700
There are even rice balls.

813
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,480
(She seems elated.)

814
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,630
(Rice balls make her happy.)

815
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,500
- Enjoy.
 -  My goodness!

816
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,360
(She smacks her lips.)

817
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,230
(The cheese is stringy.)

818
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,760
I feel bad for the other couple.

819
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,200
(Let's drink some water to forget about our hunger.)

820
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,630
(I also want a bite of the chewy cheese.)

821
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,030
Se Jeong, you must love tteokbokki.

822
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,630
- I really love it.
 -  Do we have to go somewhere else?

823
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,360
Shall we wait until someone comes? When will they come?

824
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,700
(What's Kwang Soo and Mi Joo's fate?)

825
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,900
(The place to play billiard)

826
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,630
- Let's go.
 -  Would you like to play?

827
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,930
- This? We give up.
 -  We might pass out if we do.

828
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,700
- I'm really dizzy.
 -  My head really hurts.

829
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,560
(I'll show you the real diaphragmatic breathing.)

830
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,230
Don't touch this.

831
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,900
You'd better not touch this, okay?

832
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,400
No one can't touch this. This is mine.

833
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,900
- Get ready.
 -  All right.

834
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,260
(The game starts.)

835
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,800
(A competitive match)

836
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,530
(I'll show you my strength.)

837
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,900
(She bumps her chin.)

838
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,330
(She only bumped into the ball slightly.)

839
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,400
She crushed it.

840
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,530
(It's crushed appallingly.)

841
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,660
(She has a secret weapon that destroys anything she touches.)

842
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,130
It's completely broken.

843
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,660
I can't get up because I'm too embarrassed.

844
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,400
(Here comes Ha Jae Suk's power.)

845
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,260
- Look at that.
 -  Goodness.

846
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,500
(The game resumes after they change the ball.)

847
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,430
(They blow back and forth.)

848
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,230
(We only hear them blowing.)

849
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,800
(Jong Kook blows hard to shoot.)

850
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,300
(Dashing)

851
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,500
(Blowing)

852
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,430
(It passes the goal line.)

853
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,650
- It's in.
 -  It's in.

854
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,620
- That was a goal.
 -  Wow.

855
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,760
You're impressive.

856
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,900
(Tuna Lady gathers all her energy today.)

857
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,060
(Tuna Lady tries to shoot again.)

858
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,530
It's in.

859
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,630
It's a goal.

860
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,990
- Great.
 -  It's in.

861
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,430
You're impressive. You play well.

862
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,130
(Jong Kook and Sa Yeon earn one Running Ball.)

863
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,400
(Guests waiting for a Running Couple are at this cafe.)

864
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,430
There they are.

865
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,600
(Guests waiting for a Running Couple are at this cafe.)

866
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,030
Who are they?

867
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,200
They're so cute.

868
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,500
- Hello.
 -  Goodness.

869
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,000
(It's a strange man with two cute girls.)

870
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,600
He looks familiar.

871
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,800
(His silhouette is familiar.)

872
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,020
Hello, Gil Gang.

873
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,930
- Hello.
 -  What brings you here?

874
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,700
- Hello.
 -  I was with family and got caught.

875
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,480
Really? Goodness.

876
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,250
They're Gil Gang's daughters.

877
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,830
Gosh, they're so pretty.

878
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,930
They're the judges of this mission.

879
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,230
- I'm nervous.
 -  I see.

880
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,830
Gil Gang and his daughters will evaluate the mission at this cafe.

881
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,050
- It's a dramatic play.
 -  How does it go?

882
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,830
There are script A and B.

883
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,630
You earn a Running Ball based on Gil Gang's evaluation.

884
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,290
- I'll pick script A.
 -  It's not up to you.

885
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,030
I'll give you script B.

886
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,000
- Gil Gang never disappoint.
 -  What are you doing?

887
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Gil Gang sure is strict.

888
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,900
- Goodness.
 -  I'll give you script A.

889
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Tell Dad to give us a good score.

890
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,260
(Please, put in a good word for us.)

891
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,720
Are you ready, Gil Gang?

892
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,830
- Yes.
 -  All right.

893
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,130
- Now...
 -  If it isn't genuine, I'll give...

894
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,560
- zero points.
 -  We'll be good.

895
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,760
Be quiet and do it.

896
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,100
Please start "Running Theatre".

897
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,600
Get ready, and go.

898
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,430
I didn't know what you'd like, so I ordered a shrimp burger.

899
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,900
(The first difficulty, "Wasabi Burger" scene)

900
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,300
(The two are sitting across from each other.)

901
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
(Goodness!)

902
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,630
(Actress: What are you trying to do?)

903
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,800
What are you trying to do?

904
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,900
(A sudden attack of wasabi)

905
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,030
His nose is cleared up.

906
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,030
Jae Seok's nose is cleared up.

907
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
(Put a piece of lemon in her mouth.)

908
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,830
I'll kill you if you tell on me or anyone who finds out.

909
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,000
(She's losing her consciousness.)

910
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,100
Goodness.

911
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,400
(I feel them just by looking at them.)

912
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:30,030
(The second difficulty, "Furiously Exhaling" scene)

913
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,900
(She can blow well after the wasabi cleared her nose.)

914
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,030
Don't underestimate me.

915
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,860
(The third difficulty, "Water Slapping" scene)

916
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,860
(She screams in excitement.)

917
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,960
(He aims the gun at her then shoots her.)

918
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,400
(He shoots water.)

919
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,760
Shoot me before you go.

920
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm tired of these games.

921
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,160
Goodness. Let's break up!

922
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,730
(She screams.)

923
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,130
(Goodness)

924
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,190
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Gosh.

925
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,260
- Oh, no.
 -  Goodness.

926
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,930
(His head spins.)

927
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,000
Are you okay?

928
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,770
You hit me so hard.

929
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,770
- Are you all right?
 -  What's going on?

930
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,060
- Se Jeong.
 -  Are you okay?

931
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,400
- You didn't crack...
 -  Why didn't it break?

932
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,430
this gourd. You should have cracked it beforehand.

933
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,500
It doesn't break even when I do this.

934
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,770
Gil Gang gave you a fail, so you failed.

935
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,800
- Gosh.
 -  The gourd didn't break.

936
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,400
Look at this. It's impossible to break this.

937
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,360
- What if I break it with my head?
 -  If so, I'll accept that we failed.

938
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,600
- Really?
 -  Yes.

939
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
- Yes, I'll accept it.
 -  Your children might get hurt.

940
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Be careful of the children.

941
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,330
(He breaks it with his strong head.)

942
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,000
(What?)

943
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,000
It's a gourd that breaks easily.

944
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,430
- It's pretty fragile.
 -  Se Jeong didn't hit him hard.

945
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,960
I can't help but accept that we failed.

946
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,860
(Come back after rehearsing more.)

947
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,000
Action.

948
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,830
(Gary and Ji Hyo start their "Running Theatre".)

949
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,360
You jerk. What happened?

950
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,500
How could you do this without telling me? How could you?

951
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,430
(The gourd rolls off.)

952
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,130
What did I do wrong?

953
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,300
Have a seat. Do you know how much I suffered...

954
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,360
because of you?

955
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,270
(Breaking)

956
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,860
(His bottom hurts as he gives everything into his acting.)

957
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
You're horrible.

958
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,110
I'm okay. Stop crying.

959
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,800
Here you go, Ji Hyo.

960
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
(Give that to me.)

961
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,830
(She blows her nose.)

962
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,120
She failed.

963
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Something came out of Ji Hyo's nose.

964
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,030
Did my nose run?

965
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,400
Try it with your left nostril.

966
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,030
The other nostril may not work.

967
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,100
Keep going. We can film that part separately.

968
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,060
What are you talking about?

969
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,430
I wish my heart would get hard instead.

970
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,000
(The third scene is "Fist of Rage".)

971
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,090
(He punches.)

972
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,590
(She holds the board and he smashes it.)

973
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,180
Do you smell something burning?

974
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,400
What? What's burning?

975
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,100
(She splashes water on him.)

976
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,830
Who are you throwing water at?

977
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,730
I don't care.

978
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,830
- Who are you throwing it at?
 -  What's burning?

979
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,990
- My heart is burning right now.
 -  Is it your heart?

980
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,090
(They hug and pop a balloon.)

981
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,200
They failed.

982
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,800
(Popping)

983
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,960
They failed.

984
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,000
(His heart turned into ashes.)

985
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
- He'd better not pass them.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

986
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,660
(What did the judges think of Gary and Ji Hyo?)

987
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,860
(He has a discerning eye.)

988
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,930
Yes, thank you.

989
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,880
- Is it true?
 -  How can they pass?

990
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,200
How can they pass?

991
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,770
- They acted realistically.
 -  What about us?

992
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,530
Didn't we also act realistically?

993
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,920
- The gourd didn't break.
 -  Oh, my goodness.

994
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,010
- Here you go.
 -  Okay.

995
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,270
How is this possible?

996
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,500
(Cafe to the hair salon)

997
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,040
This mission is called "Colourful Limbo".

998
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,290
One of you are to lift your partner and go under the limbo stick.

999
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,520
The couple that passes the lowest limbo earns three Running Balls.

1000
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,790
However, every time you try, you must do something...

1001
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,560
which is getting a colour spray treatment from the hair stylist.

1002
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,360
- Let's try it once.
 -  Gosh.

1003
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,900
- I'll lift you. Let's try it.
 -  I don't want to.

1004
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,190
Can I make myself lighter?

1005
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,300
Mi Joo, you can't be that heavy.

1006
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,930
- We just had some food.
 -  Come on.

1007
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,420
I'm scared.

1008
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,060
- One.
 -  I won't breathe.

1009
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,030
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1010
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,430
(She falls down.)

1011
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,660
(A counterattack of a girl group member)

1012
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,830
I don't think I can lift you.

1013
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,200
Try it once. It'll be fine.

1014
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
- Let's try it.
 -  Okay.

1015
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,700
Please make it look pretty.

1016
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,730
Okay.

1017
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,210
It looks so good, Kwang Soo.

1018
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,530
Are you spraying green?

1019
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,840
What's going on here?

1020
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,300
I can't do this.

1021
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,400
Isn't this a limbo set?

1022
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,730
- Here you go.
 -  What's this?

1023
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,600
- Are you done?
 -  Yes.

1024
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,960
- Are you really a hair stylist?
 -  I'm sorry.

1025
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,430
How could you do this so carelessly?

1026
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,600
- You look very good.
 -  What's wrong?

1027
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,960
- How can he lift me and do that?
 -  The colour won't fade.

1028
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,860
(Kwang Soo tries at 75cm.)

1029
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,130
What are you doing?

1030
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,330
(He struggles.)

1031
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,530
Wow, goodness.

1032
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,000
- I'm sorry. Must I continue?
 -  He can't do it.

1033
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,100
He can't do it.

1034
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,660
- Wait a minute.
 -  Shall I tilt my head?

1035
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,960
(He reaches a limit.)

1036
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,560
I have to lift my leg off the ground.

1037
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,660
I can't lift it.

1038
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
(They squirm.)

1039
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,770
(I guess this is the end.)

1040
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,160
What are you doing?

1041
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,930
How low is this?

1042
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,960
(He changes his plan to move 1mm at a time.)

1043
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
- It's okay, I got it.
 -  There you go.

1044
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,230
Can you lift your legs?

1045
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,060
You may be able to make it.

1046
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,840
Let's see.

1047
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,750
Don't move your legs so much.

1048
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,430
Why did you try 70cm?

1049
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,770
- I passed the stick.
 -  They might make it.

1050
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,120
- That could work.
 -  They want to use up the energy.

1051
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,360
He might fall on his bottom. Will they make it?

1052
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,830
(Unfortunately, Kwang Soo and Mi Joo fail.)

1053
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,900
Go on.

1054
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,030
That was a close call.

1055
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,560
- We'll try now.
 -  Seok Jin doesn't have to lift her.

1056
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,960
- Woman may lift the man.
 -  How could I let her?

1057
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,580
Sir, Sir, Sir!

1058
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,830
Sir!

1059
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,300
- What's that?
 -  What are you doing?

1060
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
You look so cute.

1061
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,830
Excuse me, Sir.

1062
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,030
You're cute.

1063
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,530
- You look cute.
 -  The colour's like doenjang jjigae.

1064
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,130
- I do look passionate.
 -  But isn't this...

1065
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,540
- Moon Sook, it's better this way.
 -  Isn't this too much?

1066
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,560
- Before...
 -  Put your arm around me.

1067
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,830
(He gives it his all.)

1068
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,200
What have you been eating, Moon Sook?

1069
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,270
I have big bones. It's my bones.

1070
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,030
Most women say it's because they have big bones.

1071
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,060
Right.

1072
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,830
(My bones are very big.)

1073
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,960
I think it's going to fall.

1074
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,430
(It's okay if you have big bones. Trust me!)

1075
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,560
You can do it, Honey.

1076
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,660
- Slowly.
 -  Be slow.

1077
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You can do it.

1078
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,530
(Moon Sook, do you trust me?)

1079
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,100
(We are a flaming youth.)

1080
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
You got it.

1081
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,000
(Seok Jin succeeds.)

1082
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,630
(Go on and play the music! Seok Jin is the best.)

1083
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,630
(Seok Jin and Moon Sook succeed at 90cm.)

1084
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,960
Moon Sook, you're light.

1085
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,930
I held a cotton puff.

1086
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,600
We'll start immediately.

1087
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,530
Can we do three tries at once?

1088
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,740
Look, it's Gary and Ji Hyo.

1089
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,060
Is this limbo?

1090
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,610
- It is.
 -  Let's start now.

1091
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,630
We're going to win.

1092
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,270
(Kwang Soo tries again.)

1093
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,300
- We can do this.
 -  Say, "start" first.

1094
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,030
- Start.
 -  What's up with my hair?

1095
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,750
How high is this?

1096
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,630
This is easy, of course.

1097
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
- If you succeed, the rank changes.
 -  It's hard from here.

1098
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,900
- It gets difficult now.
 -  You must stand up.

1099
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,830
- It's difficult to get up.
 -  It's limbo.

1100
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,030
- Do you win when you stand up?
 -  Yes.

1101
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,120
Smack me once.

1102
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,130
(She obliges.)

1103
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,300
(He's awake now.)

1104
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,960
- One more time.
 -  No, it's okay. This is good.

1105
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,060
(It was a miraculous touch.)

1106
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,130
- He's done.
 -  You're almost there.

1107
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,240
- You're good. Stand up now.
 -  Get up.

1108
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,530
Don't look. Just stand up.

1109
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,270
(Will Mi Joo's slap work?)

1110
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,730
Stand up. Good, okay.

1111
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,730
(Lifting)

1112
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,300
(Kwang Soo and Mi Joo succeed at 80cm.)

1113
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,100
How high was this one? Was it 80 cm?

1114
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,160
(Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are currently in 1st place.)

1115
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,660
(Running Theatre)

1116
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,930
I'm your aunt.

1117
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,100
Yeon Soo, where's the origin of your last name?

1118
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,770
What group are you from? From what line? Generation?

1119
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,720
- I'm from the 29th generation.
 -  I see, Sir.

1120
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,730
I'm first.

1121
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,730
- I'm very...
 -  That was quite...

1122
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,370
Auntie.

1123
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,270
Please take good care of me.

1124
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,290
- They're my aunts.
 -  They're so cute, really.

1125
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,860
Ready, action.

1126
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
I didn't know what you'd like, so I ordered a shrimp burger.

1127
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,270
Let's eat.

1128
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,330
It looks delicious.

1129
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,630
(I hate that we must eat this while knowing.)

1130
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,830
(The two are sitting across from each other.)

1131
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,930
(Her nose is painfully refreshed.)

1132
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
(Laughing)

1133
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,900
My tongue is numb.

1134
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,830
Goodness, I'd rather live alone.

1135
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,130
I'd rather live alone. Let's break up.

1136
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,930
(This is a true Running Woman's gourd breaking.)

1137
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,200
(She hits his head with the gourd and leaves.)

1138
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,660
- How did we do?
 -  In 1, 2, 3. Great job.

1139
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,660
(They succeed.)

1140
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,750
Are you okay?

1141
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,410
I got hit on the side of my head.

1142
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,430
Action.

1143
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
You jerk.

1144
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,200
(Breaking)

1145
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,560
What happened? Why didn't you tell me?

1146
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,430
Where? Do you see?

1147
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,660
(The fire has been extinguished.)

1148
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,270
(It's powerful acting.)

1149
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,660
My heart has changed.

1150
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,740
- Did they do well?
 -  How was it?

1151
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,160
In 1, 2, 3.

1152
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,430
(They passed.)

1153
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,400
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1154
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,830
- You're the best.
 -  Goodness.

1155
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Three more.

1156
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,200
(Eating)

1157
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,770
(She eats...)

1158
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,900
(and eats.)

1159
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,930
(The barbell...)

1160
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,830
(makes an assist.)

1161
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,830
Haha and Jae Suk.

1162
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,360
(Haha and Jae Suk win.)

1163
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,660
We did it.

1164
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,130
(They finish a meal through the mission.)

1165
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,660
(Ji Hyo and Gary come first with 7 Balls.)

1166
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,400
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok's team come last.)

1167
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,710
Let's go, hurry. Good.

1168
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,360
(They try 75cm.)

1169
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
(They pass the bar with ease.)

1170
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Gary.

1171
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,860
- Grab onto me.
 -  Okay.

1172
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,770
You got it.

1173
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,730
Do I have to get up now?

1174
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Get up.

1175
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,860
(He uses his lower body strength.)

1176
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,360
(Gary and Ji Hyo succeed and come 1st place.)

1177
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,660
Do you want to try 70 cm to be safe?

1178
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,160
Okay, let's do that.

1179
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,900
Let's do 65cm. 65cm.

1180
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,720
- Gary, this is too low.
 -  We can do it.

1181
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,430
It's best to succeed here so we can get three Balls.

1182
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
Let's go.

1183
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,130
In 1, 2, 3.

1184
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,360
(They pass with ease thanks to their good teamwork.)

1185
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,360
Lean down more. I'll grab you.

1186
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
You did it.

1187
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,200
(They pass the bar at once.)

1188
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,160
You did it. Gary, you can do it.

1189
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,400
(After 6 years together,)

1190
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,560
(Gary and Ji Hyo are the best at couple games.)

1191
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,660
(They showed unbelievable power in front of 300 people.)

1192
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,160
(Today, they show off their great chemistry once again.)

1193
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,700
- Gary, get up.
 -  Wait, a little more.

1194
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,130
Stand up.

1195
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,430
(He puts in all his might.)

1196
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,430
(They set a new record.)

1197
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,500
Yes!

1198
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,630
(They are always the best duo.)

1199
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,360
(Gary and Ji Hyo are 1st, Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are 2nd.)

1200
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,160
- There won't be a difference.
 -  Really?

1201
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,110
- Should I just stay still?
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1202
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,560
(He's in shock.)

1203
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,730
(Wait a minute, Sa Yeon.)

1204
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,200
Hey, you're making her embarrassed. Jong Kook!

1205
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,300
(He lets go of her.)

1206
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,830
Are you going to let her fall like this?

1207
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
- No, it's not that.
 -  Let's do it again.

1208
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,160
Are you going to let her fall like that?

1209
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,560
(Let's try again.)

1210
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,420
- Let's do it again.
 -  What?

1211
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,060
Try lifting me one more time.

1212
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,630
Try up to here.

1213
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,940
We're going to practise.

1214
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,430
This is your last try.

1215
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,760
(Straining)

1216
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,030
(Is she a tuna fish or a whale?)

1217
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,300
- Hurry and stand up.
 -  I can get up.

1218
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,560
I can get up but I'm thinking about passing through.

1219
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,230
I'm sorry.

1220
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,630
(Leaning over)

1221
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,630
Jong Kook!

1222
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,060
(He lets go of her again.)

1223
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,620
Are you going to keep dropping her like this?

1224
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,430
My goodness. You should rest here.

1225
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,430
- Gosh.
 -  I wanted you to rest.

1226
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,610
- I didn't see you that way.
 -  No, it's not that.

1227
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,500
- I thought you could lift me.
 -  Try it again.

1228
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,560
- I can stand up.
 -  Really?

1229
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,730
- Sa Yeon, can you excuse us?
 -  I can get up.

1230
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,880
I'll try it with Se Jeong.

1231
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,300
- Okay, good.
 -  Are you okay?

1232
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,030
- He got it.
 -  I'm okay.

1233
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,040
- Hold on.
 -  We have to go down.

1234
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,660
(He begins with a smooth pick up.)

1235
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,000
(Only the beginning was smooth.)

1236
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,530
(Should I rest, too?)

1237
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,500
- Wait a minute.
 -  At least try to go under.

1238
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,700
Wait a minute, please.

1239
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,300
Sit. You have to sit completely.

1240
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,100
Se Jeong, go out first. Good, you go first.

1241
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,630
(You first, Se Jeong.)

1242
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,330
- You can let your hands go.
 -  Okay.

1243
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,430
Good job.

1244
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,560
(It won't be that easy.)

1245
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,260
They can't do it.

1246
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,260
Se Jeong.

1247
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,700
You can go. Go alone.

1248
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,100
(I don't think I can go any more.)

1249
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,060
- This is difficult. I'm flustered.
 -  Goodness.

1250
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
That's it. Goodness.

1251
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,030
(Jae Seok and Se Jeong fail.)

1252
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,660
- You did well.
 -  This is hard.

1253
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,560
- Good job, Se Jeong.
 -  It's hard to go under.

1254
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,020
I think 65cm is too low.

1255
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,400
Can we practise a bit more?

1256
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't think we can.

1257
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,420
Let's try again. You're good at this.

1258
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,430
- Let's go.
 -  Okay.

1259
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,860
I'll go out first like they did.

1260
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,530
- Let's go out. Let's do it.
 -  Okay.

1261
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,530
Great.

1262
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,130
Look.

1263
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,730
(They barely...)

1264
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,960
(pass her head.)

1265
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,660
I'm going.

1266
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,870
(She hits the bar.)

1267
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,140
I'm going.

1268
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,260
(She makes a double K.O..)

1269
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,300
Sa Yeon, this isn't a lawn.

1270
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,730
(This summer, a tuna appears on the blue ocean.)

1271
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,120
Sa Yeon, may I try it with you?

1272
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,640
- Really? Are you sure?
 -  Yes.

1273
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,360
Jae Seok exercises a lot.

1274
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,930
It'll feel like you're carrying two Se Jeongs.

1275
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,160
My gosh, Sa Yeon.

1276
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,960
(I was wrong.)

1277
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,430
Goodness, I'm sorry.

1278
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,000
- Stand up.
 -  I'm sorry.

1279
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,200
I don't think I can do it.

1280
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,560
Get up.

1281
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,130
Try moving.

1282
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,160
- You can do it.
 -  Try it at least.

1283
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,730
- I can't go another step.
 -  Try it once.

1284
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,400
- Hurry.
 -  This is the best I can do.

1285
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
(I think this is where it ends.)

1286
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,260
(Falling)

1287
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,100
Oh my goodness.

1288
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,230
(Why can't you guys hold me?)

1289
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,890
- I'm sorry, Sa Yeon.
 -  You did well.

1290
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,100
It's my first time.

1291
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,430
(She lives up to her name.)

1292
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,660
- You tried.
 -  We got weaker.

1293
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,430
- Right. We got weaker.
 -  We...

1294
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,900
(Jae Seok's lower body gives in.)

1295
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,960
It's not that serious.

1296
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,420
- She's not that heavy.
 -  I didn't drink water today.

1297
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,260
- I didn't have any water.
 -  What are you talking about?

1298
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,730
- It's because I'm dehydrated.
 -  It's not that bad.

1299
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,100
- Let's give up on this.
 -  Let's go.

1300
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,200
- We can't succeed here.
 -  Let's go to the Photo Zone.

1301
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,930
- Let's take our baby.
 -  Let's go to the Photo Zone.

1302
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:31,930
Gosh.

1303
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,260
(Sa Yeon leaves after showing off her superior weight.)

1304
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,830
(We will take three photos at the Photo Zone.)

1305
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,130
What do you do at the Photo Zone?

1306
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,430
Step on me and go up.

1307
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,200
What should I do?

1308
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,630
(Photo Zone begins.)

1309
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,420
What should we do? Goodness!

1310
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,030
- Get away.
 -  My gosh.

1311
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,960
- Go, go.
 -  Jump.

1312
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,800
- This doesn't work.
 -  We can do it.

1313
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,560
- I can't do it.
 -  Get on.

1314
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,260
(We can't use that method.)

1315
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,060
(3 photos are taken.)

1316
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,600
You have to do this. Go like this.

1317
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,830
(Gary and Ji Hyo are clearly visible.)

1318
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:14,000
(Is this a ghost?)

1319
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,430
Oh my gosh!

1320
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,560
Look at that.

1321
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,700
(Gary and Ji Hyo succeed.)

1322
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,500
I think luck is on our side today.

1323
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,730
It's our day.

1324
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,760
(I have a good feeling about this.)

1325
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,860
(Meanwhile, in the billiard room)

1326
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,760
We have a chance.

1327
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,930
Hello.

1328
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,360
(Their rival, Jae Seok and Se Jeong appear.)

1329
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,660
You must have been to the hair salon.

1330
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,560
What is that?

1331
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,830
(They're good in styling.)

1332
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,290
- You must have been there.
 -  Of course.

1333
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,860
I told you. Today isn't our day.

1334
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,720
- Nothing goes as I planned.
 -  Exactly.

1335
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,930
How many have we got?

1336
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,530
Can I tell them?

1337
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,240
- Don't tell them.
 -  Really?

1338
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,900
- How many?
 -  I think they got about three.

1339
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,230
(Laughing)

1340
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,930
- How did you know?
 -  Really?

1341
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,000
We got three.

1342
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,190
How did you know?

1343
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,100
I'm sorry about this. I was so surprised.

1344
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,500
The bag is bulging.

1345
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,260
- You're amazing.
 -  You're lying, right?

1346
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,430
We need to win this, Mi Joo.

1347
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,500
How many have you done?

1348
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:19,860
We're ruined.

1349
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,860
(Blowing)

1350
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,330
(It's a close game.)

1351
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,820
(Kwang Soo attacks.)

1352
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,430
(It fails.)

1353
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,200
This is scary.

1354
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,660
(Hitting)

1355
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,640
(Jae Seok's attack almost had them lose a point.)

1356
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,400
(Is that how you want to play it?)

1357
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,820
(Hitting)

1358
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,840
Wait. What are you doing?

1359
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,560
What are you doing?

1360
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,830
(I'm just returning the favour.)

1361
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,660
(Blocking)

1362
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,030
- That's cheating.
 -  It's just...

1363
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,830
- It's not cheating.
 -  Where are they?

1364
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,180
- It was a mistake.
 -  You cheated.

1365
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,360
- It's a penalty.
 -  I'll receive the penalty.

1366
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,330
- Okay.
 -  Over here.

1367
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,030
You can't eat from now on.

1368
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,560
- This hand won't be able to eat.
 -  Yes.

1369
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,500
You can punish it with a slap.

1370
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,190
(He hits the hand hard.)

1371
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,900
It needs to learn a lesson.

1372
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,060
That's it.

1373
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,860
I won't use my right hand.

1374
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,990
Help me out.

1375
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,560
It's a penalty kick.

1376
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,660
It's all right to have a goalkeeper.

1377
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,330
- There's no point, then.
 -  We can have a goalkeeper.

1378
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,160
- Wait, give me your hand again.
 -  Why?

1379
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,330
(Fighting)

1380
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,830
- You can't be there.
 -  We need to have a goalkeeper.

1381
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,500
(Kwang Soo gets ready for the penalty blow.)

1382
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,230
(It's not on pause.)

1383
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,930
(I'm concentrating hard, Mi Joo.)

1384
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,000
(Kwang Soo catches them off guard.)

1385
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,130
It moved.

1386
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,560
It didn't. I was breathing out.

1387
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,130
(Kwang Soo misses his penalty kick.)

1388
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,260
It was from my nose.

1389
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,430
(It becomes heated again.)

1390
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,030
(Blowing)

1391
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,830
(Half spitting)

1392
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,330
(They keep cheating.)

1393
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,330
It's so hard.

1394
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,430
Mi Joo!

1395
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,730
Throw-in.

1396
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,700
(Then I'll throw it in.)

1397
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,530
- That's cheating.
 -  Isn't throw-in allowed?

1398
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,260
- Throw-in isn't allowed?
 -  It's a penalty.

1399
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,930
- Penalty.
 -  Penalty kick.

1400
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,130
I'm tired.

1401
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,030
(I won't let you.)

1402
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,900
(Gripping)

1403
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,230
(Poking)

1404
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,060
(Jae Seok misses his penalty kick.)

1405
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,960
(That's too much.)

1406
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,030
I'm sorry.

1407
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,000
- My goodness.
 -  Is it usually like this?

1408
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,360
(The game continues.)

1409
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,900
(Gagging)

1410
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,830
(He's out of breath.)

1411
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,760
This is the end for Jae Seok.

1412
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,260
(Now's the chance.)

1413
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,700
(Kwang Soo succeeds.)

1414
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,300
(Kwang Soo and Mi Joo win.)

1415
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,630
Team Kwang Soo wins with a score of 1 to 0.

1416
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,800
(They scored miraculously in the end.)

1417
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,230
We will go back to the gym.

1418
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,660
("Gather the Running Balls" is over.)

1419
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,860
(The number of Running Balls each team gathered)

1420
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,930
With the Running Balls that you gathered,

1421
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,040
we will draw a lottery for Revival Cards with Ahn Gil Gang.

1422
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,260
We won't tell you the result.

1423
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,900
(Revival Cards could turn the final results around.)

1424
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:48,030
(Who will be the lucky team?)

1425
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,390
It's now time for the final mission.

1426
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,730
The final mission is...

1427
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,230
"The Link between You and Me".

1428
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,560
- When we begin,
 -  Link.

1429
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,700
Running Women should go right.

1430
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,060
Running Men should go left.

1431
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,760
(The starting point for men and women are different?)

1432
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,060
You can't see nor meet your partner.

1433
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,100
(We can't meet our partners?)

1434
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,400
Ladies will start Name Tag Elimination 10 minutes early.

1435
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,100
After 10 minutes, men will start.

1436
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,100
If your partner gets eliminated...

1437
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,060
during the first 10 minutes,

1438
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,750
you cannot participate in the game.

1439
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,530
You cannot participate.

1440
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,600
(It's a real link.)

1441
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,330
(The result of the final mission depends on Running Women.)

1442
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,330
(If the woman is eliminated, the man is eliminated instantly.)

1443
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,200
- The whole team gets eliminated?
 -  That's it.

1444
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,960
If the man is eliminated, the woman will be eliminated as well.

1445
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,480
Your lives are linked.

1446
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,760
- The team gets eliminated.
 -  We don't meet?

1447
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,500
You can't meet.

1448
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,630
(They win if they survive and stick their name tags on the overpass.)

1449
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,380
Does revival apply to the whole team?

1450
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,490
You'll be revived together.

1451
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,560
If someone gets a hold of you, you need to go like this.

1452
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,230
Like this.

1453
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:23,020
You need to push and strip it as quickly as possible.

1454
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,490
- Okay.
 -  Speed is most important.

1455
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,400
- You need to go like this.
 -  From the sides? Okay.

1456
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:29,930
You got it?

1457
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,430
Only one survives in the end.

1458
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,060
You need to betray them.

1459
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,600
- Okay.
 -  Don't trust anyone.

1460
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,130
- You need to use full power.
 -  Okay.

1461
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,730
(Seok Jin and Moon Sook plan to use their power.)

1462
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,100
(What?)

1463
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,430
I ripped both sides of the Velcro.

1464
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,550
(Moon Sook ripped his clothes as well.)

1465
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,350
- Isn't this too harsh?
 -  Oh, my.

1466
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,860
Moon Sook. I'm worried for your team.

1467
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,030
Do we have an extra t-shirt?

1468
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,700
All right. Ladies will go right.

1469
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,060
Will it be decided with one game?

1470
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,660
(She's waiting impatiently.)

1471
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,830
I'm nervous.

1472
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,130
(She sighs heavily.)

1473
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,330
(She looks around.)

1474
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,230
(She's looking for a place to hide.)

1475
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,760
(Her movements somewhat resembles Kwang Soo's.)

1476
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,730
I won't fit in here. I'm done for.

1477
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,860
I'll hit anyone who comes this way with this towel. Can I do that?

1478
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,330
- Hitting isn't allowed.
 -  Really?

1479
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:32,430
(She might knock someone down.)

1480
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,030
I'm not allowed to hit anyone?

1481
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,500
I'll be hiding here.

1482
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,560
I'm going to rip the name tag as soon as the door opens.

1483
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,810
Can I knock them out and rip their name tags?

1484
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,900
Can I?

1485
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,930
(Running Women are ready.)

1486
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,660
They're beginning. Okay.

1487
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,700
Sa Yeon will be hard to beat.

1488
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,930
(Sa Yeon needs to be eliminated.)

1489
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,430
It will be chaotic on the men's side.

1490
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,630
Sa Yeon needs to be eliminated.

1491
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,830
I'm a little worried but Se Jeong is fast.

1492
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,830
She seems to be good at sports.

1493
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,930
Jae Suk is here to win.

1494
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,030
(He's worried about Jae Suk.)

1495
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,330
I hope Jong Kook gets eliminated.

1496
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,700
(Jong Kook is warming up.)

1497
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,600
She needs to choose her allies well.

1498
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,760
If she pairs up with Jae Suk, they'll be unbeatable.

1499
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,760
Hang in there.

1500
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,240
(You have to hang in there to betray them.)

1501
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,930
Jae Suk. Hang in there.

1502
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,330
The ladies need to do well.

1503
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,860
I need to survive until the end.

1504
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,730
(Running Women are our hope.)

1505
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,230
Running Women Name Tag Elimination will begin.

1506
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,600
(Running Women Name Tag Elimination will begin.)

1507
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,630
Five, four, three,

1508
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,500
- Oh, my.
 -  two and one.

1509
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,930
The race begins.

1510
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,010
I'm nervous.

1511
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,400
The race begins.

1512
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,900
(Where should I go?)

1513
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,860
Which way should I go?

1514
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,260
(She goes down the stairs.)

1515
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,900
(Jae Suk appears.)

1516
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,400
(Running)

1517
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,660
Jae Suk.

1518
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,900
(Jae Suk, join me.)

1519
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,260
Jae Suk.

1520
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,860
Where did she go?

1521
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,930
(She is ambushed by Jae Suk.)

1522
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,530
Wait.

1523
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,930
(Let's talk this out first.)

1524
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,860
Please don't forget me.

1525
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,100
- I'm sorry.
 -  Jae Suk. Wait.

1526
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,730
Wait.

1527
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,350
(She pushes her.)

1528
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,200
- She's so strong.
 -  Jae Suk.

1529
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
(Se Jeong attacks back.)

1530
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,600
Se Jeong, you have a Revival Card.

1531
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,260
- I don't.
 -  You do.

1532
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,560
- Jae Suk.
 -  She's so strong.

1533
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,260
Jae Suk.

1534
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,060
There's no good in beating a weak person.

1535
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,300
I'm the weak person.

1536
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,230
(Men's fate depend on the women's competition.)

1537
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,630
She's so strong.

1538
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,400
(She runs away.)

1539
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,160
She's really strong.

1540
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,500
(If Se Jeong's out, Jae Seok is also out automatically.)

1541
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,430
(Where are Sa Yeon and Moon Sook?)

1542
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,860
Be careful.

1543
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,560
(Did the best players become allies?)

1544
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,130
You'd better be careful from now on.

1545
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,760
(She's being careful.)

1546
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,730
(Ji Hyo and Jae Suk check each other out without attacking.)

1547
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,990
- Jae Suk.
 -  Where are you headed?

1548
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,000
Will you take off my name tag? Do you have a Revival Card?

1549
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,950
If I do, why would I be here?

1550
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,100
I'd rather rest. Look at me sweating.

1551
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,660
Let's not take off each other's name tag for now.

1552
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,500
Will you take off mine?

1553
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,430
(Okay, I'll trust you for now.)

1554
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:06,000
(She catches them.)

1555
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,030
(Sa Yeon and Moon Sook spot Ji Hyo and Jae Suk.)

1556
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,900
(Let's go and attack them.)

1557
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,130
(She turns off the light.)

1558
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,200
(Tuna Lady turns off the light by mistake.)

1559
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,630
(Goodness!)

1560
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,330
She gave me a fright.

1561
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You startled me.

1562
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,860
- Wow.
 -  The game is nip and tuck now.

1563
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,530
Where are the little ones? Only the strong players are here.

1564
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,900
Let's start with the younger ones.

1565
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,700
- The younger ones?
 -  Whom should we become allies with?

1566
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,130
Shall we get rid of...

1567
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,400
- the weak ones first?
 -  Let's do that.

1568
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,260
- Shall we get rid of them first?
 -  Then the four of us can fight.

1569
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,290
Okay, then we'll play fairly.

1570
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,530
Why don't we pair up and go this and that way?

1571
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,260
- One should go that way.
 -  We have to stay focused.

1572
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,930
Let's play after we get rid of the weak ones.

1573
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,960
- Do you promise?
 -  Yes, I promise.

1574
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,200
If you betray us, you'll have a hard time in your career.

1575
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,510
Okay? Do you understand?

1576
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,600
The 4 of us will attack the other 2.

1577
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,350
It's okay because their male partners...

1578
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:17,390
- Seok Jin has to win.
 -  You have only three minutes left.

1579
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,430
- Let's hurry.
 -  Hurry up.

1580
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,060
- Let's do it before men start.
 -  Where are they?

1581
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,330
- Do we go downstairs?
 -  Yes.

1582
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,960
- Let's go downstairs.
 -  Okay.

1583
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,650
You can't take off my name tag.

1584
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,060
Then it won't be fun.

1585
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,130
- My partner is Seok Jin.
 -  Okay.

1586
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,430
It's Seok Jin, I see.

1587
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:34,360
Three minutes are left for Name Tag Elimination.

1588
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,060
Three minutes?

1589
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,230
(Do they still have three minutes left?)

1590
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,500
Is the announcer drunk?

1591
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,200
(Mi Joo is at risk, but why doesn't the time pass?)

1592
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,060
He sounds drunk. How is that possible?

1593
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,800
My moustache grew while we were waiting.

1594
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,860
(Mi Joo, please stay alive.)

1595
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,830
Brace yourself for today.

1596
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,230
It's time now.

1597
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,400
(The predators' partners are relaxed.)

1598
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,430
Jae Suk.

1599
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,330
I expect Sa Yeon to take off two name tags.

1600
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,130
I think I should.

1601
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,400
(What's the current situation at Running Women's race?)

1602
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,900
(Se Jeong and Mi Joo formed an alliance.)

1603
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,630
(They're startled.)

1604
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,560
(I hear the others' breathing.)

1605
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,730
What do we do?

1606
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,100
- Sa Yeon, hurry up.
 -  Okay.

1607
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,200
(The predators slowly lay a siege.)

1608
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,260
(Her name tag is exposed.)

1609
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:22,930
(She slowly approaches.)

1610
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:26,700
(She reaches her hand toward Moon Sook's name tag.)

1611
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,700
(What are you doing?)

1612
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,980
I just laid my hand there.

1613
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,800
- I'm serious.
 -  What are you doing?

1614
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,330
You scared me.

1615
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,430
Gosh.

1616
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,530
If you don't keep your promise,

1617
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:42,430
I'm going to say bad things about you everywhere.

1618
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,130
(I'll get my chance again.)

1619
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,230
(The predators are still looking for the weaker ones.)

1620
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,330
Did you find them? Where are they?

1621
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,060
(At that time)

1622
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,430
(She reaches for Jae Suk this time.)

1623
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,530
(Gosh)

1624
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,030
(Tuna Lady, you shouldn't do that.)

1625
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,130
- What's going on?
 -  You can't do that.

1626
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,000
- You can't do that.
 -  You can't do that.

1627
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,760
- You can't do this.
 -  Come on.

1628
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,620
- I just wanted to try it.
 -  Gosh.

1629
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,630
How can I trust anyone in this world?

1630
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,330
You can't do this.

1631
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,290
I just wanted to try it.

1632
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,800
Let's let Sa Yeon experience what it feels like.

1633
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,380
I'm dizzy.

1634
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,600
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

1635
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,560
You started it.

1636
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,400
I said I just wanted to try it.

1637
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,530
(She tears it off.)

1638
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,730
(Sa Yeon is out.)

1639
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,860
Jong Kook is out, too.

1640
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,120
(You have no mercy at all.)

1641
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,320
- I'm sorry, Sa Yeon.
 -  I'm sorry.

1642
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,730
(Tuna Lady is out first.)

1643
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:45,060
- Did you see that?
 -  Sa Yeon is out.

1644
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,000
(In that case...)

1645
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,310
(Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.)

1646
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,330
Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.

1647
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:57,190
(Did I hear something wrong?)

1648
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,600
No way.

1649
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,030
(This is so futile.)

1650
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,430
What's going on?

1651
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,790
Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.

1652
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:11,800
- What?
 -  Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.

1653
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,830
Who?

1654
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:14,030
Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.

1655
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,700
(Thank goodness.)

1656
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,650
What on earth?

1657
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,860
(This is so unexpected.)

1658
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,360
- Jong Kook and Sa Yeon are out.
 -  Wow.

1659
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,830
A strong player is out. Who took off her name tag?

1660
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,030
(Everyone seems happy to hear the strongest couple got eliminated.)

1661
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,730
What if they have a Revival Card?

1662
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,960
Jong Kook, you must head to prison now.

1663
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,060
Can't I stay here?

1664
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,730
This is the same as prison.

1665
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,130
(He's sent to prison even before the race starts.)

1666
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,700
- You must go now.
 -  I can't believe it. What happened?

1667
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,030
(What happened, Tuna Lady?)

1668
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,850
Did you see what happened to Sa Yeon?

1669
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,010
- Let's eliminate the others first.
 -  Okay.

1670
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,230
- It's for real, right?
 -  Yes.

1671
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,530
Running Men's Name Tag Elimination starts.

1672
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,100
- Let's go upstairs.
 -  Men's Name Tag Elimination starts.

1673
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,960
- Men started, too.
 -  Five, four...

1674
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,300
- three...
 -  Men also started.

1675
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,160
- Men play their own game.
 -  Right.

1676
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,830
- We may be sent to prison suddenly.
 -  Why?

1677
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:11,360
We may be sent to prison if our partner's name tag is taken off.

1678
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,170
I'm in trouble because of Seok Jin.

1679
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,330
Running Men's Name Tag Elimination starts.

1680
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,530
(Running Men's Name Tag Elimination starts.)

1681
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,430
I must hide.

1682
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:24,400
I didn't expect that to happen.

1683
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,650
(Jae Suk's partner Haha is at risk.)

1684
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,360
Which couple has a Revival Card?

1685
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,330
- Seok Jin, did you hear the news?
 -  Yes.

1686
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,900
- Didn't Sa Yeon...
 -  She got eliminated.

1687
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,400
Don't suspect me.

1688
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,630
- Don't suspect me, either.
 -  I'm really not the one.

1689
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,160
- Are you sure?
 -  Yes.

1690
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,400
- Do you have a Revival Card?
 -  No.

1691
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,360
Please don't run around.

1692
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,990
- I'm dead if I get eliminated.
 -  Really?

1693
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,360
You know I only have four.

1694
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,590
- Seok Jin.
 -  Hey, Kwang Soo.

1695
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,060
(Kwang Soo joins them.)

1696
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,240
- Did you know Sa Yeon's eliminated?
 -  Yes.

1697
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,590
- Let's attack Haha first.
 -  It doesn't matter.

1698
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,290
- Let's attack Haha first.
 -  Why?

1699
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,130
He's partners with Jae Suk.

1700
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,760
- Haha?
 -  Yes.

1701
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,010
This game is over once Jae Suk and Sa Yeon are eliminated.

1702
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:02,990
Don't do anything foolish.

1703
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,430
We must not.

1704
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,060
- I'm being serious.
 -  I'll keep my hands together.

1705
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,920
I'm eliminated if you take off my name tag.

1706
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,140
I'm really eliminated if you take off my name tag.

1707
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,060
- Me too.
 -  I'm being serious, Kwang Soo.

1708
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,360
- I'm being serious.
 -  Me too.

1709
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,500
(Kwang Soo who always plays tricks)

1710
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,780
(Seok Jin who's ready to follow)

1711
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,900
(Gary who's sometimes an ace)

1712
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,360
(The three of them team up.)

1713
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,930
(Jae Suk's partner Haha is the first target.)

1714
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:27,600
Which floor was Haha on?

1715
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,800
He could be on the second floor.

1716
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,430
He's either on 2nd or 3rd.

1717
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,200
Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are out.

1718
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,000
(Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are out.)

1719
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,770
Who is out?

1720
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:42,260
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1721
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,260
Do you feel it's unfair?

1722
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,430
Goodbye, Kwang Soo.

1723
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,130
(Goodbye, Kwang Soo with his fingers locked.)

1724
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,730
I'm locking my fingers because I'm embarrassed.

1725
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,300
(He's sent to prison with his fingers locked.)

1726
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,830
(One minute ago where Running Women are)

1727
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,000
- Let's go.
 -  Will we be here all night?

1728
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,060
- Don't do it.
 -  Let's go.

1729
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,560
Will we be here all night?

1730
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,760
(The predators are attacking the prey as a team.)

1731
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,560
- Let's go.
 -  You called us here.

1732
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,260
Ji Hyo.

1733
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,030
No.

1734
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,260
(Their hunting starts.)

1735
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,330
Ji Hyo.

1736
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,530
(They show too much love to Mi Joo.)

1737
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,660
Ji Hyo.

1738
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,860
(She screams.)

1739
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,160
(The girls are at risk.)

1740
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,430
No, don't do it!

1741
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,630
- Oh my.
 -  Tear it off.

1742
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,830
That's right. Take it off.

1743
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:26,830
(She tears the name tag.)

1744
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,900
(Mi Joo is eliminated.)

1745
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,660
- That was crazy.
 -  I'm sorry.

1746
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,600
Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are out.

1747
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,200
(Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are eliminated.)

1748
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,660
Kwang Soo and Mi Joo are out.

1749
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,760
(What great news.)

1750
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,830
Why are they eliminated?

1751
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,900
Somebody must've ripped Mi Joo's name tag.

1752
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,030
Se Jeong is impressive then.

1753
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,560
Wow, she's impressive.

1754
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,360
(What if Se Jeong wins at this rate?)

1755
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,500
There's Kwang Soo.

1756
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,520
Jae Seok and Se Jeong are out.

1757
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,620
Goodness.

1758
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,300
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1759
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,660
I didn't do anything.

1760
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,100
I was just about to start.

1761
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,200
I was just...

1762
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,660
(It was his quickest elimination.)

1763
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,730
Gosh.

1764
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,230
I was just about to run away.

1765
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,430
I was about to get started.

1766
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,960
You must head to prison.

1767
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,630
I'm going to lose my mind.

1768
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,300
No, don't.

1769
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,730
Don't, don't.

1770
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:25,730
(Playback of what happened)

1771
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,730
No, don't do it.

1772
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,430
- Why not?
 -  I'm really exhausted.

1773
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,500
(Se Jeong resists with all her might.)

1774
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,800
(Tearing)

1775
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,130
(But she failed.)

1776
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,200
I'm sorry.

1777
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,760
I'm sorry.

1778
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,010
Goodness, it's so unfair.

1779
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:41,250
Please let me participate for just two minutes.

1780
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,660
You're already eliminated.

1781
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,360
(Se Jeong, see you in prison.)

1782
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,100
It must be fun.

1783
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,100
(He wants to participate.)

1784
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,630
I used to like it very much.

1785
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,600
- Did you get the sign?
 -  Yes, I did.

1786
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,530
(Only three teams remain. They must stay alert at all times.)

1787
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,130
(Ji Hyo has her back towards me.)

1788
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,130
(She's off guard.)

1789
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,260
(This is her perfect chance.)

1790
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,430
Haha and Jae Suk are out.

1791
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:19,030
- Who?
 -  Haha and Jae Suk are out.

1792
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,730
No way!

1793
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,800
Gosh.

1794
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,530
Goodness.

1795
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,160
(What happened to her?)

1796
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,230
Haha!

1797
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,330
What was all this for?

1798
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That pretty girl...

1799
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,430
(What did I do to Se Jeong?)

1800
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,930
You must go see her now.

1801
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,400
I'm about to cry. Can I cry here?

1802
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,070
(Poor girl.)

1803
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,830
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1804
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,860
Gosh.

1805
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,430
- This is unbelievable.
 -  "This is unbelievable".

1806
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,800
You must win.

1807
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,930
- What is it?
 -  It's over now.

1808
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:59,270
Wait. Hold on.

1809
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,880
Remove at least one more person, Jae Suk!

1810
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,150
Remove Gary's name tag.

1811
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,230
Stay still.

1812
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,660
(They remove Haha's name tag.)

1813
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,200
(Haha and Jae Suk are out.)

1814
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,600
Who's left now?

1815
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,630
(Only two couples survived.)

1816
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,000
(Seok Jin and Moon Sook vs Ji Hyo and Gary)

1817
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,160
Let's go for another round.

1818
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:20,200
When three members cornered me, I was so scared.

1819
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,360
- Right.
 -  Right.

1820
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,960
- Se Jeong.
 -  I think it's reality.

1821
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,830
I have been harassed by 6 members for the past 7 years.

1822
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,930
- Gosh.
 -  Se Jeong.

1823
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,000
One person harassed six members.

1824
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,960
(This is the truth.)

1825
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:34,260
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

1826
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,160
- Why?
 -  You must tell the truth.

1827
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,070
Who has the Revival Card?

1828
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,330
- It's either Gary or Seok Jin.
 -  It's one of those two.

1829
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:42,570
- I think...
 -  I think it's Gary...

1830
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:45,430
because the way Ji Hyo acted was so suspicious.

1831
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:48,200
- Ji Hyo is so crafty.
 -  That crafty Ji Hyo...

1832
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,920
- She's crafty.
 -  Ji Hyo is so crafty!

1833
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,800
She acted very strangely.

1834
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,240
Ji Hyo is so crafty!

1835
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,260
Gary has become a skilful actor now.

1836
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,030
- Today,
 -  He kept a poker face.

1837
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,070
Gary and Ji Hyo looked strange today.

1838
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,150
What about you? Do you have the Card?

1839
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,000
If we had one, we'd be already out.

1840
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,700
- That's right.
 -  Okay.

1841
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,790
Take some rest.

1842
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,960
Okay. It was a hard day.

1843
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,160
You should give up now.

1844
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,260
Now, I'm a canned tuna.

1845
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,730
(She is very exhausted.)

1846
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,430
Then who are the ones that are still left?

1847
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,660
Is it only Seok Jin's couple and us?

1848
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,630
(Only 2 teams survived.)

1849
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,800
Seok Jin should survive somehow.

1850
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,430
What if we lose before we even start fighting?

1851
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,200
(If either one is out, the couple fails.)

1852
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:36,570
(Meanwhile, in the men's stadium...)

1853
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:39,230
Gary, we must do something.

1854
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,260
You're right.

1855
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,360
Before Moon Sook finds Ji Hyo...

1856
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,070
It's locked.

1857
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,960
(Moon Sook, I trust you.)

1858
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,630
(She spots Ji Hyo.)

1859
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,070
(Seok Jin vs Gary)

1860
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:01,430
(Moon Sook vs Ji Hyo)

1861
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,930
(Their battle will determine the winning couple.)

1862
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,030
Let me take yours.

1863
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,960
I'll make you be in the spotlight today.

1864
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,160
(Your future will be prosperous.)

1865
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,530
(Will the fierce Moon Sook and Seok Jin win?)

1866
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,570
(It won't be that easy.)

1867
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,700
(This 7-year-old couple has great chemistry.)

1868
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,900
(Will the Monday Couple have the honour of winning?)

1869
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,960
(This final battle...)

1870
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,960
(will determine the winner of today's match.)

1871
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,700
(The couple to place their name tags on this overpass wins.)

1872
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:44,160
(Who will be the final winners?)

1873
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,360
(What?)

1874
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,430
(Is that Gary?)

1875
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,300
Ji Hyo, you did a good job.

1876
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,070
You did a good job, too.

1877
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,330
- Ji Hyo, as you said...
 -  I said I was prepared.

1878
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,360
Yes!

1879
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,700
- Good!
 -  Good job.

1880
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,800
(During the final battle...)

1881
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,360
(Ripping)

1882
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,330
(Gary removed Seok Jin's name tag.)

1883
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,100
(Moon Sook was a little late.)

1884
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,330
It was close.

1885
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,100
(Seok Jin and Moon Sook failed.)

1886
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,530
- Seok Jin and Moon Sook are out.
 -  Okay!

1887
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,570
- It was so close.
 -  Ji Hyo!

1888
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,760
I'm sorry, Moon Sook.

1889
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,160
(The couple who received the Revival Card...)

1890
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,070
(was Gary and Ji Hyo.)

1891
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:29,260
(Gary and Ji Hyo started the mission with the Revival Card in hand.)

1892
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,860
(However, they won without using the Revival Card.)

1893
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,360
(Gary and Ji Hyo are the final winning couple.)

1894
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,000
I love that this show doesn't contain an inch of trust.

1895
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,900
- I can't believe anyone.
 -  Right.

1896
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,700
I heard that it's you who started the betraying chain.

1897
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,700
(The Running Women had a long day.)

1898
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,060
- To the winning couple...
 -  What is it?

1899
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,200
(They receive a golden badge and a golden tiara.)

1900
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,360
Thank you.

1901
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,040
(Jealous)

1902
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,260
It was...

1903
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,070
Jae Suk!

1904
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
Thank you.

1905
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,880
(Thank you, Running Women, for joining us today.)

1906
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,410
(3 late summer blockbusters)

1907
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,930
Game of Emperor's Throne.

1908
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,530
When the moon overlays the sun, the new emperor will be chosen.

1909
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,700
(Lee Joon Gi, Kang Ha Neul and Hong Jong Hyun)

1910
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,000
I will destroy them. You won't survive.

1911
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,430
(There is 1 throne but 10 princes.)

1912
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:20,960
(They fiercely struggle to hold the throne.)

1913
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,030
The sun and the moon,

1914
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,570
set us free!

1915
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:25,620
(And...)

1916
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,430
(the secret of the throne is revealed.)

1917
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,160
(Who will travel through time and hold the throne?)

1918
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,960
(Game of Emperor's Throne)

1919
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,800
