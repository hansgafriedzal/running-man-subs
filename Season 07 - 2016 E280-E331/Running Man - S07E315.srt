1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,480
(On a late summer day, at Yeouido Park)

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,150
Hello.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,780
(Is Jae Seok the first member to arrive?)

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,950
This is Jong Kook's car.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,250
- Are you dressed in black again?
 -  What's wrong?

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,850
- It's better than long sleeves.
 -  It's hot. Why do you wear black?

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,520
You'll be divided into two teams and compete against each other.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,420
- A car is coming to pick you up.
 -  Really?

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,020
The guest will choose his team members.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,250
(The guest will get to choose his team members.)

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,620
- Really?
 -  That means I can organise...

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,580
my team regardless of his choice, right? I can manage that.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,200
Organise your team? What are you talking about?

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,460
Goodness.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,080
- I'll organise my team...
 -  It means you are an outcast.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,720
- You're just an outcast.
 -  No, I'm not. It's different.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,550
It's only that the person hasn't been chosen. Don't say it like that.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,520
Do you remember the fight in the mud?

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,050
- We were so manly.
 -  You were awesome.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,120
- You were the best.
 -  I mean it.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,680
It was a clash between power and speed.

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,310
You were very powerful.

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,690
(They praise their own performance.)

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,750
PS stands for power and speed.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,320
I like that. PS.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,480
- P!
 -  S! Good!

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,520
How about this?

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,690
- If only one of us gets chosen,
 -  Yes.

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,620
- let's not get on the car together.
 -  Of course.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,850
(Let's just drop out together.)

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,020
- How's my idea?
 -  We must keep our dignity.

32
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
If the guest is male, he'll choose Ji Hyo.

33
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,880
- No, Gary.
 -  If the guest is female,

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
- she'll choose Kwang Soo.
 -  You never know.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
Don't say that.

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,250
- I'm so lonely.
 -  What are you talking about?

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,310
(Yeouido Park)

38
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,680
(Meanwhile, somewhere in Yeouido Park)

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,450
(Under a cloudless sky)

40
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,980
(What?)

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
(There's a trolley in the middle of the park.)

42
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,580
(A map?)

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,180
(A car arrives.)

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,350
(The guest that members are waiting for is...)

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,920
Hello.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,680
(Cha Seung Won)

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,050
(This sexy man knows how to cook.)

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,480
(The handsome middle-aged guy, Cha Seung Won, is on Running Man.)

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,890
Today's race is called "Running Map".

50
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,560
We have a map ready for you.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,920
Please hop on the trolley bus...

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,530
and pick up the members.

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,280
Choose the ones you like.

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,020
How can I do that? I'd feel bad for the others.

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,720
Don't worry. It's only to divide them into two teams.

56
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,530
Goodness.

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,350
I don't know...

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,950
all the Running Man members,

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,120
but I know most of them.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
(I have to choose between acquaintances and strangers.)

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,220
Will this take me to the members?

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,420
They're all waiting in the vicinity of the park.

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,050
What are they doing in this heat?

64
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,320
(They're waiting for you.)

65
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,050
I'm not sure what to do.

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,520
There it comes.

67
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,150
There must be someone.

68
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,130
- Goodness.
 -  They are here.

69
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,870
Gosh, they shouldn't be together.

70
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,020
What is this map about?

71
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,050
Jae Seok.

72
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,420
- You can't pick both of them.
 -  Jong Kook.

73
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,070
- It's Seung Won.
 -  Seung Won.

74
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,050
- You are here.
 -  Seung Won.

75
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,250
- Hello.
 -  Seung Won.

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,750
(He gives a big smile.)

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Hello.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,880
- You look very fit.
 -  You look better than before.

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,120
- Really?
 -  Yes.

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,010
Really?

81
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,320
Wow, Seung Won.

82
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,730
- What should I do?
 -  Seung Won.

83
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,650
- Don't touch him.
 -  Come here for a minute.

84
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,840
- Why are you touching him?
 -  You don't know what may happen.

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,520
- What do you mean by that?
 -  What should I do?

86
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,620
Let's get on the trolley.

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,950
- Wait a minute.
 -  Just get on.

88
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,550
- Stop.
 -  Wait a minute.

89
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,420
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Let him choose.

90
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,490
- By the way, Jong Kook,
 -  Yes?

91
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,220
I haven't seen Jae Seok in a long time.

92
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,280
Exactly. You should stay here.

93
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,050
- Seung Won.
 -  Yes?

94
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,380
If you don't pick me, you'll have to deal with me.

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,280
(You'll have to deal with me.)

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Come on, can't you deal with him?

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,580
- No.
 -  You can defeat him.

98
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,650
I can't.

99
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,010
Goodness.

100
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,680
How can I defeat him?

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,180
It doesn't matter. Do what makes you feel comfortable.

102
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,150
- He usually takes revenge.
 -  I know.

103
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,620
- Does he hold grudges?
 -  No, he doesn't.

104
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm weak when it comes to affection.

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,180
- Don't feel pressured.
 -  Hurry up.

106
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,120
He doesn't like revenge.

107
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,110
It's not that.

108
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,750
- I haven't seen you in a while.
 -  Okay, I'll get on.

109
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,050
- Okay.
 -  Stay here.

110
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,180
Jong Kook, I'm sorry.

111
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,450
- Don't apologise to him. Get on.
 -  It's okay.

112
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,520
- Let me go. Go on the trolley.
 -  Get on.

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,920
Go on the trolley first.

114
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,250
(Let me apologise to him first.)

115
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,570
- Come on, Seung Won.
 -  Jong Kook.

116
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,390
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
 -  It's okay, Seung Won.

117
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,020
He's the type to take revenge.

118
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,320
Goodness.

119
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,810
- Why were you with him?
 -  Jong Kook.

120
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,020
Jae Seok.

121
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,250
(I'm going to get you.)

122
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,230
- Gosh.
 -  Good to see you.

123
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,080
- Long time no see. Have a seat.
 -  I know.

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,420
- You made the right choice.
 -  Really?

125
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,850
(It's like a ride through a safari.)

126
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,620
Let's talk later.

127
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,800
You're so soft-hearted. Why would you talk to him later?

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,390
- See you.
 -  Don't look at him.

129
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,450
- I'm getting motion sickness.
 -  It's okay.

130
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,020
Of course you should choose me.

131
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,750
- Is Jong Kook okay?
 -  Of course, he is.

132
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,430
- Goodness.
 -  Don't worry about him.

133
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,280
Things turned out well. Who's next?

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,580
- Next choice will be easier.
 -  Don't worry, Seung Won.

135
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,880
The next members won't be scary at least.

136
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,610
- They won't make me feel awkward.
 -  They won't.

137
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,520
- I'm usually not afraid of people,
 -  I know.

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,520
but Jong Kook is scary even on television.

139
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,850
(Jong Kook is scarier than anything else.)

140
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,020
(Around the corner is the second meeting place.)

141
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,550
- There they are.
 -  There they are.

142
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,920
- There they are.
 -  There they are.

143
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,380
A map?

144
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,950
(The members who are waiting here are...)

145
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,470
Is that a trolley?

146
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,360
(Kwang Soo, Gary and Ji Hyo.)

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,820
- It's Kwang Soo and...
 -  There are three of them.

148
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,360
Please get off the bus first.

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
It's Seung Won.

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,820
Seung Won.

151
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,950
Hello, Seung Won.

152
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,620
- Hello, Seung Won.
 -  Hello.

153
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,920
- Hello.
 -  It's nice to meet you.

154
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,220
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

155
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,450
Hey.

156
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,220
What I want to say is that...

157
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
- I have to choose only 1 person.
 -  Out of 3 of them?

158
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,050
That's really difficult.

159
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,880
What happened to you? Did he choose you?

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,180
Yes, he chose me.

161
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,450
- Are you sure?
 -  I'm his assistant.

162
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,250
- It's nice to meet you.
 -  Get back on the trolley.

163
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,750
- This is difficult, indeed.
 -  Jae Seok was with Jong Kook.

164
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,720
- It was really...
 -  You're wise.

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,910
Jong Kook was scary.

166
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,880
Good luck with making decisions.

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,020
(Good luck with making decisions.)

168
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,650
I'm worried.

169
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,020
- There he is.
 -  He's here.

170
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,550
- Jong Kook.
 -  He's being ridiculous.

171
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,620
- That's a huge difference.
 -  Wait a minute.

172
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,380
- How could it be so different?
 -  Get on the trolley.

173
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,320
Remember that I'm watching you.

174
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Hurry up, Seung Won. He's riding a black van, too.

175
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,750
Kwang Soo is my junior in modelling.

176
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,680
There's a lot of traffic right now.

177
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,420
I'm sorry.

178
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,520
- Thank you.
 -  Oh no.

179
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,380
- Thank you.
 -  Let's get on.

180
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,050
- Let's go.
 -  He's a traitor.

181
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,520
- Thank you.
 -  Hurry up and get in.

182
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,070
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Why did you pick him?

183
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,750
- What's wrong?
 -  Why did you pick him?

184
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,280
- Was he a bad choice?
 -  It's not that.

185
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,180
- Please believe me.
 -  What's wrong?

186
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,120
I won't make you regret today.

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,720
What if we become the losing team?

188
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,350
No way.

189
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,150
Kwang Soo is my junior in modelling.

190
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,490
- He is your junior?
 -  Of course.

191
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,150
He's a junior comedian.

192
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,020
Come on, Jae Seok.

193
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,520
- Kwang Soo was a famous model.
 -  He was a famous model?

194
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,020
- Yu Hae Jin was also famous.
 -  He was?

195
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,080
That's what he says.

196
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,750
(Laughing)

197
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,680
- He says that about himself.
 -  You startled me.

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
He always says that to me.

199
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
Goodness.

200
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,220
It seems to me...

201
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,750
that since you chose me and Kwang Soo,

202
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,380
you prefer being funny to winning.

203
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,950
I knew it.

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,650
What's the point of winning on the show?

205
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,350
- I know.
 -  That's right.

206
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,460
They're here.

207
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,020
- Gosh.
 -  Who's on the trolley?

208
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,750
- Who's on the trolley?
 -  I see Jae Seok.

209
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,920
Yu Jae Seok.

210
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,960
- I'm your fan, Seung Won.
 -  Hello.

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Haha.

212
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,020
How have you been? Hello.

213
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,820
- I'm your fan.
 -  Hello.

214
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,120
Let's get on the bus, Seung Won.

215
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,420
Wait a minute.

216
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,920
- He looks like he's in his 20s.
 -  What should I do?

217
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,750
- Whom should I choose?
 -  Jae Seok is here.

218
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,260
- Hello.
 -  Gosh, I don't know what to do.

219
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,580
What do I do about Haha?

220
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,740
It's difficult to choose between the two.

221
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,420
We made up our minds.

222
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,950
We'll stay together no matter what.

223
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,480
What did you say?

224
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,580
Haha, let's go.

225
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,020
- Okay, Seung Won.
 -  Okay.

226
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,650
I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

227
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
Why did you make that useless comment?

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,650
- Why did you say that?
 -  Haha.

230
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,450
Come back out here.

231
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,550
- How funny.
 -  You are amazing.

232
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,120
Seok Jin, come this way.

233
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,350
Just come here now.

234
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,740
(This is where you belong.)

235
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,390
That was his last decision.

236
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,550
(Seung Won's team gets on the trolley.)

237
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,140
- You made your decision quickly.
 -  Put your seat belt on.

238
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,220
It's because...

239
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,730
- I know Haha already.
 -  I know.

240
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,750
You picked your teammates based on...

241
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,280
your prior relationships.

242
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,850
(He's gone through a hard time with Jae Seok.)

243
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,920
It's more tiring.

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,750
(He met Kwang Soo while modelling.)

245
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,150
(He met Haha on television.)

246
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,280
(Seung Won values his relationships.)

247
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,650
- I'm all about relationships.
 -  I know.

248
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,620
(Team Blue versus Team White)

249
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,990
(Fishing area, Naengmyun restaurant, Noryangjin, Mangwon Market)

250
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,220
(With entertainment leader Cha Seung Won,)

251
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,150
(complete the Running Map.)

252
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,250
(Laughter and food can be found on the road.)

253
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,380
(Find R Mon in various places...)

254
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,180
(to find out the secret to Running Map.)

255
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,280
You and Hae Jin make a fantastic couple.

256
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,160
Hae Jin is great,

257
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,250
and Gary is similar to him.

258
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,250
- They're a little similar.
 -  You are right.

259
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,180
"Do it like this."

260
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,590
Goodness.

261
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,730
(They're definitely similar.)

262
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,610
"Let me see."

263
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,950
Imagining him here tires me out.

264
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm so tired of him.

265
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,750
(They move to R1 point.)

266
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,540
There's a lot of good food here.

267
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,120
- These croquettes look delicious.
 -  They look delicious.

268
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,080
- I haven't been here in a while.
 -  I want some donuts.

269
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,380
Fruits are being sold already.

270
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,440
There's a lot to eat at this market.

271
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,250
- That looks delicious as well.
 -  It's tteokgalbi.

272
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,520
Wow, what's that?

273
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,750
- It's tteokgalbi.
 -  I want some.

274
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,380
- That's delicious.
 -  It's really delicious.

275
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,750
- Look at jokbal.
 -  It's jokbal.

276
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,280
- That looks delicious.
 -  That's mini-jokbal.

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,820
- That looks really good.
 -  I can sense what's going on.

278
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,220
(He trips and falls.)

279
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,820
(He was too busy staring at the food.)

280
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,220
Shouldn't we eat kalguksu here?

281
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,420
It's okay.

282
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,500
Are you just going to look at food without eating?

283
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,920
- Are you okay?
 -  That's how I tripped.

284
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,150
(He was close to tasting the ground.)

285
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,820
(There's a flag in the middle of the market.)

286
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,880
What's going on?

287
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,450
Do we sit at the table with our team?

288
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,880
Sit with your team, please.

289
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,920
What's this?

290
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,150
- There's eight.
 -  What's this?

291
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,270
- Nakji jeongol sounds good.
 -  I like small octopus.

292
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,820
The winner gets food that's famous at this market, which is...

293
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,120
- modeum jeon...
 -  Let's eat jeon.

294
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,350
- and sikhye.
 -  Sikhye?

295
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,750
You'll play a game called "Tug for Food".

296
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,750
- What's that?
 -  Is it like tug of war?

297
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,750
The person to bend the knees first while pulling the rope loses.

298
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,180
- That's really difficult.
 -  It requires strength.

299
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,850
You decide the order. You compete based on the order.

300
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,620
Discuss in which order you'll play.

301
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,520
- I want to play against Seung Won.
 -  Why?

302
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,120
I don't want to play against Jong Kook.

303
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,350
(No thank you.)

304
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,750
- Let's see.
 -  Please think carefully...

305
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,980
- Please determine the order.
 -  and determine the order.

306
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,220
Stop it.

307
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,220
He's Jong Kook's target today.

308
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,080
(They whisper among themselves.)

309
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,020
(Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, Haha, Seung Won)

310
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
We're done.

311
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,280
- You decided the order in secret?
 -  Yes.

312
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,590
(Gary, Jong Kook, Seok Jin, Ji Hyo)

313
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,020
(The list of matches is made.)

314
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,880
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes?

315
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
- Don't go easy on him.
 -  I know.

316
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Kwang Soo's feet are too big.

317
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
He has giant feet.

318
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,520
(He has large feet.)

319
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,650
- Kwang Soo, show us your strength.
 -  Okay, Jae Seok.

320
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,880
I don't have much space to sit.

321
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm also at the edge.

322
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,550
- I'm sitting on the pavement.
 -  You're too tall.

323
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,620
- Don't yield to him.
 -  Shouldn't he move up?

324
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,250
- Come on, Gary.
 -  How can you do this?

325
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,650
I'll hold the middle.

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,850
- Get ready.
 -  Wait, I'm not ready yet.

327
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,100
(The winning team in "Tug for Food"...)

328
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,680
(can enjoy modeum jeon...)

329
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,220
(and sikhye.)

330
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,650
(Kwang Soo, I'm hungry.)

331
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,880
Ready, set, go!

332
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
(Go!)

333
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,950
You're doing good.

334
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,750
Look at them go.

335
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,750
Don't bend your knees.

336
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,080
(This isn't a face making game.)

337
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,380
Don't bend your knees.

338
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,480
- Watch your knees.
 -  Hey.

339
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,010
- That's not fair play.
 -  He bent his knee.

340
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,470
- Don't bend your knees.
 -  Watch your knees.

341
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,670
(He bent his knee.)

342
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,680
Hey.

343
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,000
- I won, right?
 -  Why did you bend your knee?

344
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
(He accidentally bent his knee to tickle Gary's foot.)

345
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,450
- Why did you do that?
 -  I was trying to tickle him.

346
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,020
- We won.
 -  Yes.

347
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,080
- All right!
 -  Gary wins.

348
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,680
- Jae Seok is a good judge.
 -  I wan to eat that modeum jeon.

349
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,280
- Why did you do that?
 -  Don't you want to eat that?

350
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,580
- I didn't mean to do that.
 -  Come on, Kwang Soo.

351
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,150
- I'm very sensitive right now.
 -  What was that about?

352
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,280
Next up,

353
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,630
Jae Seok from Team Blue...

354
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,500
- and Jong Kook from Team White.
 -  Yes, we won already.

355
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,120
I didn't think of Seung Won as that kind of guy.

356
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,180
(The two are exchanging mixed feelings of joy and sorrow.)

357
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm fine.

358
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,350
Good job, Ji Hyo.

359
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,120
- I don't mind it.
 -  Ji Hyo.

360
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,380
- You've got a good taste.
 -  I'm fine.

361
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,410
You don't know yet. We could win.

362
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,150
- I agree.
 -  We never know.

363
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,150
This could go either way. Jae Seok works out a lot.

364
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,480
(I can't live under your shadow forever.)

365
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,650
(But the opponent is Jong Kook.)

366
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,150
Go!

367
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,350
(He roars like a lion.)

368
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,150
(There was no hope to begin with.)

369
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
That was quick.

370
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,750
(He got lifted.)

371
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,680
That was boring.

372
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,420
- Is that all you got?
 -  That was really boring.

373
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,640
We're having fun here.

374
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,420
- You think you can do better?
 -  Why are we playing this game?

375
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,750
- Don't say that.
 -  I want to give it a try.

376
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,270
- Wait.
 -  Try it, Seung Won.

377
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,280
- You didn't say start.
 -  You try.

378
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,630
(Is that his wallet?)

379
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,150
- You didn't say start.
 -  Hey, Seung Won.

380
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,740
Why did you bring your wallet here?

381
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,180
- Seriously.
 -  Why didn't you leave it somewhere?

382
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,880
Opportunity makes the thief, you know.

383
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,740
- Hold on.
 -  You try it.

384
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,380
I'm tired of losing.

385
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,680
This is it. We can win this one.

386
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,030
Go, Seung Won.

387
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,380
He's flexible.

388
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm not that flexible. That's the problem.

389
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,480
Why are all the games favourable to Jong Kook?

390
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,400
- Why is that?
 -  I won't go easy on you.

391
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,480
Seung Won works out a lot, too.

392
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,880
(Go!)

393
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,650
(He gets pulled all the way.)

394
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,850
(It was like seeing the evolution of man.)

395
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,150
(How dare you?)

396
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,360
- Move over.
 -  He's angry.

397
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,660
Get over here, Seung Won.

398
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,580
He's not worth it.

399
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,170
(Jong Kook almost got pounded by Seung Won.)

400
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,680
You almost got pounded.

401
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,180
Relax.

402
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,520
I thought we had a chance this time.

403
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,250
Jong Kook is way too strong.

404
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,480
- How are we supposed to win?
 -  He's unbeatable.

405
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,280
- Unlucky draws.
 -  Exactly.

406
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,320
- There was no way we could win.
 -  Ji Hyo drew well.

407
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,180
- You were good.
 -  Hey, Seung Won.

408
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,020
- Do you feel good about yourself?
 -  He's good.

409
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,670
- He's our guest today.
 -  Hey.

410
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,120
(This is what Jong Kook is capable of.)

411
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,520
I don't believe that guy.

412
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,750
For the second game, I'll show you the prize first.

413
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
(They're croquettes.)

414
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,460
- What is that?
 -  Those are my favourite.

415
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,850
Aren't those croquettes?

416
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,950
They are croquettes.

417
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,640
The second game is "Slap the Book".

418
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,570
- What is that?
 -  "Slap the Book"?

419
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,880
- If you flip all five coins,
 -  Consecutively?

420
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,220
you will win.

421
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,250
Let's go.

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
Show us what you got.

423
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
(They are destined to compete with each other.)

424
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
(It's the battle between Jong Kook and Jae Seok.)

425
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,480
(This is your chance to take revenge.)

426
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,670
- Jae Seok, we have to eat those.
 -  Okay.

427
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,980
Those are ours.

428
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,020
- I want the croquettes, Jong Kook.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors?

429
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,880
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Paper.

430
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
All right.

431
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,350
This should work better.

432
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,750
Leave it alone.

433
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,280
(He gives an unsatisfied look.)

434
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,150
- What are you doing?
 -  Don't interfere.

435
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,880
- Fine.
 -  Stop moving the book.

436
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,150
(He slaps the book.)

437
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,150
("Slap the Book" begins.)

438
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,980
Why do you keep switching the court?

439
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,250
- What are you talking about?
 -  It doesn't matter.

440
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,250
(This is the chance to redeem myself.)

441
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,750
(He slaps the book.)

442
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
What are you doing?

443
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,750
(It got flipped to its original state.)

444
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,580
Have you never played this game?

445
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,680
- To be honest, I'm not that good.
 -  The game isn't over yet.

446
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,870
- I knew it.
 -  Flip the other ones, Jong Kook.

447
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,680
Have you not played this game in high school?

448
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,250
Jae Seok, make your hand like this.

449
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,250
Seung Won, I'm not very good at it.

450
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,680
- I'm not feeling confident.
 -  At least do the hands right.

451
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,050
At least do the hands right.

452
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,950
(Four coins got flipped.)

453
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,100
(The person to flip the last coin wins.)

454
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,280
- Jae Seok!
 -  This is our chance.

455
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,360
- This is so easy.
 -  It hit my thumb.

456
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,420
- I can do this.
 -  Hey!

457
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,420
(The coin spins in the air.)

458
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,740
- We did it!
 -  I did it!

459
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,190
(It flipped.)

460
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,020
- We did it!
 -  I did it!

461
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,880
(Seung Won looks the happiest.)

462
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,580
- We did it.
 -  We won.

463
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,860
Thanks, Jong Kook.

464
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,850
- Team Blue wins.
 -  It was all thanks to Jong Kook.

465
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,300
I take no credit.

466
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,850
I'm glad it turned out this way.

467
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,190
It feels even better to win like this.

468
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,050
- Lastly,
 -  Yes.

469
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,480
we will be playing "Slap-Match".

470
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
It's a good game.

471
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,570
The winner will continue playing until he or she loses.

472
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,620
The prize is jokbal.

473
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,280
- It's jokbal?
 -  I'm really craving jokbal.

474
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,020
He even fell down because of that.

475
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,690
- He fell really hard.
 -  I did.

476
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,280
We've all played this game, right?

477
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,750
You know the game right, Seung Won?

478
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,220
- Yes, you just need to flip that.
 -  The winner stays on.

479
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,450
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  This is really important.

480
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,640
Rock-paper-scissors.

481
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,050
- All right.
 -  Why did you lose?

482
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,060
- Did you do that on purpose?
 -  Don't worry about it.

483
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,050
Whenever you're ready.

484
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,420
- Right here?
 -  Yes.

485
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
- That's where I should aim, right?
 -  Yes.

486
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Go.

487
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,380
(Here she goes.)

488
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,220
(She slaps it.)

489
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,050
(It got flipped.)

490
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,020
(One shot, one kill)

491
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
- What is this?
 -  She's so good.

492
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,980
I've been practising with my dad.

493
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,580
- What happens now?
 -  She didn't even give him a chance.

494
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,730
- Get out.
 -  Do we keep going first?

495
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,250
- Do rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors.

496
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,490
(Paper and scissors)

497
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,850
Why did you do that?

498
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,120
Why did you show it first?

499
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,750
- You showed the paper.
 -  Why did you do that?

500
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,690
- Don't show them your pick.
 -  Hey, I'm the oldest here.

501
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,950
Move over.

502
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm good at this game.

503
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,250
- Let me handle this on my own.
 -  Hey, Seung Won.

504
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,880
- Don't tell me what to do.
 -  We were too sensitive.

505
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,520
- I'm sorry.
 -  Do you see how much I'm sweating?

506
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,360
- I can see that.
 -  I'm trying really hard.

507
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,650
We just want you to have that jokbal.

508
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,750
- I understand.
 -  Okay.

509
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,580
- She won't be able to do it again.
 -  You can do it, Ji Hyo.

510
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,570
I know you have it in you.

511
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,690
- She's good.
 -  Right here?

512
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,580
She's been practising.

513
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,470
- She practised with her father.
 -  She's a try-hard.

514
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,120
Why do we play these games?

515
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,080
Don't let them get to you.

516
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,280
- Be calm.
 -  Give it a go.

517
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
That's it.

518
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,980
(It got flipped again.)

519
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,690
(Hard work always pays off.)

520
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,820
- She's crazy.
 -  What's gotten into her?

521
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,380
This is your day, Ji Hyo.

522
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,050
- He didn't even get to try.
 -  Hey.

523
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,050
Sorry, that's not her fault.

524
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm just going to order some jokbal for myself.

525
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,920
Do you hear me?

526
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,580
I have my wallet with me.

527
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,250
- It's not over yet.
 -  Yes, the game isn't over.

528
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,690
This stupid game.

529
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,750
- Ji Hyo isn't even sweating.
 -  This is stupid.

530
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,150
- I'll win.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors.

531
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,100
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  All right.

532
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,220
- Three loses in a row.
 -  I don't believe this.

533
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,750
- Why did you go with paper again?
 -  I didn't know.

534
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,650
We've all lost with paper.

535
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,480
- I'm a bit tired.
 -  You can do it, Ji Hyo.

536
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,020
You can still do it.

537
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,190
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
 -  She's perfect for this game.

538
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,050
She's too good.

539
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,750
Can you go easy on us?

540
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,190
- She's going to do it again.
 -  Do it again, Ji Hyo.

541
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,480
She shouldn't have any energy left.

542
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,380
(It got flipped again.)

543
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,480
(That's disheartening.)

544
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,320
You make me sick.

545
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,520
Why is this so easy?

546
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,690
This is weird.

547
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,850
There's something wrong with it.

548
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,880
You should have won the rock-paper-scissors, then.

549
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,420
Shouldn't we do a drug test on her?

550
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,690
- This is our last chance.
 -  He's the last one.

551
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,250
- You have to win.
 -  I can't afford to lose this one.

552
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,950
You have to win the rock-paper-scissors.

553
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,250
- She's our new "Slap-Match" queen.
 -  You're the king of "Slap-Match".

554
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,980
Rock-paper-scissors.

555
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,480
(Rock and paper)

556
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,520
(She's the winner.)

557
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,050
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Didn't I say you have to win?

558
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,010
- This is over.
 -  I'm sorry.

559
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,250
Don't you ever call yourself the king of "Slap-Match" again.

560
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,150
You said I should go for rock.

561
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,480
- When did I say that?
 -  Forget it.

562
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
- Well, that's too bad.
 -  She won all of them.

563
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,580
Why did you go...

564
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,850
- without discussing it first?
 -  This is driving me crazy.

565
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,870
- Put an end to this, Ji Hyo.
 -  This is driving me crazy.

566
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,380
- End this.
 -  Do it, Ji Hyo.

567
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,120
- Right here.
 -  End it, Ji Hyo.

568
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,180
This is crazy.

569
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,750
- Please, not again.
 -  Go for it.

570
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't listen to them.

571
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
This is the chance to knock them all out by yourself.

572
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,280
- Go, Ji Hyo.
 -  You can do it.

573
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,150
Show them what you're capable of.

574
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,380
(Is this going to be it?)

575
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,480
(Or is this the beginning of a turn-around?)

576
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,880
(She slapped it.)

577
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,050
(It got flipped again!)

578
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,290
(She knocked them out all by herself.)

579
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,920
Wow, she's amazing today.

580
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,290
He can't do it.

581
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,350
Why isn't this working?

582
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,050
(He's mad.)

583
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,480
- Why can't I flip this?
 -  They didn't even get to try.

584
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,320
- I didn't see this coming.
 -  Is this it then?

585
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,620
What does your father do?

586
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,850
He must be good at "Slap-Match".

587
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,650
How could this happen?

588
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,950
(Team White wins!)

589
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,880
- I can't believe this.
 -  This is ridiculous.

590
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,050
- The croquettes are here.
 -  They look so good.

591
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,880
How could we not win a single game?

592
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,560
- We didn't even lose on purpose.
 -  Can we have some?

593
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
- Look at this sikhye.
 -  Hey, Gary.

594
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,190
- Okay, fine.
 -  Here you go, Ji Hyo.

595
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,040
I don't think we're allowed to share.

596
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,580
Don't give them any.

597
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,880
We won the game. They shouldn't get any.

598
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,650
- It looks good.
 -  Look at these croquettes.

599
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,520
- They look really good.
 -  They do.

600
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,620
It's delicious.

601
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,850
- It really is.
 -  Let me try some.

602
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,450
- What's in it?
 -  This is good.

603
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,680
(She's got her eyes on sikhye.)

604
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,150
(He can't stop thinking about jokbal.)

605
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,980
(It should have been mine.)

606
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,020
Give Seung Won some.

607
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,410
He fell because of jokbal.

608
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,680
- It's amazing.
 -  I really want some jokbal.

609
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
Open up, you.

610
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,980
(He's teasing him.)

611
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,680
How could you do that? Don't let them do that to you.

612
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,410
That's so childish.

613
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,620
- Let go of me.
 -  Don't eat that.

614
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,250
- Please.
 -  Go to a restaurant later.

615
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,380
No, let me handle this. Hear me out.

616
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,650
- I can't watch you like that.
 -  No, this is the thing.

617
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,480
- That made me mad.
 -  You should have won the game.

618
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,250
He shouldn't have let it touch my lips.

619
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,120
Why did he put it and the sauce on my lips?

620
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,730
- What is he doing?
 -  He is teasing us.

621
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,450
(Jae Seok sneaks up from behind.)

622
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,130
Hey, what are you doing?

623
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,720
What are you doing?

624
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,950
- What are you doing?
 -  Drink this. Quickly.

625
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,550
Hey, wait. What do you think you are doing?

626
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,850
- Come on, Seok Jin.
 -  What do you think...

627
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,720
- you are doing?
 -  Stop stealing.

628
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,550
- What do you think you are doing?
 -  Stop stealing from them.

629
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,130
(Seung Won drinks the entire sikhye.)

630
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,450
- Hey.
 -  Come on, Seok Jin.

631
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,730
Why did we play the game in the first place?

632
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,020
- Come on.
 -  Stop it.

633
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,850
- Come here, Gary.
 -  Gosh.

634
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,820
(Both teams receive a map piece.)

635
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,120
Thank you for the meal.

636
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,610
- Thank you for the meal.
 -  You can't share the map piece.

637
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,820
- Let's go.
 -  Thank you for the meal.

638
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,220
(They move to the next destination.)

639
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,650
(They move from Mangwon Market to a naengmyun restaurant.)

640
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,980
This time, the winning team will win cold naengmyun dishes.

641
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,610
You will play a game called "Zoomed in Penalty Kick".

642
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,370
All of you will have a chance to shoot at once...

643
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,220
but it will be too dull if we let you just kick the ball.

644
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,890
So you need to wear a pair of telescope glasses.

645
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,950
(What? A pair of telescope glasses?)

646
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,520
(Are they really wearing this?)

647
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,450
The goalies also need to wear them.

648
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,120
- So who wears the glasses?
 -  Both the kicker and the goalie.

649
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,990
We have the Korean Oliver Kahn.

650
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,350
Hi. I'm Oliver Kwang.

651
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,280
- We have Gary Yashin.
 -  Gary Yashin.

652
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,680
- So they are the goalies?
 -  Yes.

653
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,460
(The Entries of the Game)

654
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,110
- Look at the ball first.
 -  Yes.

655
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,220
- Look at where the ball goes first.
 -  Okay.

656
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,380
- Kwang Soo looks like Usain Bolt.
 -  You can't see this?

657
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
(They look very similar.)

658
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
- I can't see a thing.
 -  Really.

659
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
- Can't you see anything?
 -  You can't? Really?

660
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,350
- Will you be all right, Kwang Soo?
 -  Yes.

661
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,950
- This could be dangerous.
 -  Kwang Soo will block first.

662
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,950
(This is how they see the world with the pair of telescopes.)

663
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,720
- Are you ready?
 -  Yes.

664
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,880
Set.

665
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,520
(Two of the Unlucky Trio are competing each other. Who'll win?)

666
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,680
Set.

667
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,620
- You're 4 steps away from the ball.
 -  Four steps?

668
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,120
Walk four steps forward.

669
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,380
(An old kicker who can't see a thing properly...)

670
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,620
(versus a tall but unlucky goalie.)

671
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
(Who will win in the end?)

672
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,480
(He misses.)

673
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,850
(He misses the ball.)

674
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,550
- That's it.
 -  No.

675
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,580
- You kicked and missed. That's it.
 -  No. It's not.

676
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,020
- He used his chance already.
 -  He didn't kick the ball yet.

677
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,850
(Seok Jin is trying again.)

678
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,620
(He scores this time.)

679
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,240
- Well done.
 -  I scored, right?

680
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,990
- Did it go in?
 -  Nice.

681
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,650
Hurry up. It's raining.

682
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,750
- Is it my turn now?
 -  It's Jae Seok's turn.

683
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,520
- Go, Jae Seok.
 -  Okay.

684
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,420
- I can't see properly.
 -  What's this?

685
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,090
- The ball will come this way.
 -  First of all...

686
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,750
I can see through only one side.

687
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,320
- I really can't see anything.
 -  Me, too.

688
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,280
Please hand him the ball.

689
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,420
(They can't see much.)

690
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,790
Jae Seok looks like that he's wearing his own glasses.

691
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,440
- It goes well with him.
 -  It matches.

692
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,320
He actually looks handsome.

693
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
(He looks like an insect.)

694
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,350
I'll win if I can kick properly.

695
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,450
One, two, three and shoot.

696
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,680
(He had a hard time kicking penalty shots before.)

697
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,520
(In Asian Dream Cup 3 years ago,)

698
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,420
He shoots!

699
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,280
(Jae Seok kicked the ball and it hit the goal post.)

700
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,420
He shoots!

701
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,010
- It hit the post!
 -  That was close.

702
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,850
It was really close.

703
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,850
Nick kick.

704
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,920
(He kicks confidently.)

705
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,120
(Gary blocks it.)

706
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,180
Nice.

707
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,080
Nice.

708
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
(Gary blocks the ball.)

709
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,980
- The ball hit him.
 -  Goodness.

710
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
- That was close.
 -  It really was.

711
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,940
Gary was really lucky.

712
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,180
- Gosh. I almost got it.
 -  If you kicked to the other side...

713
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,280
I could see the ball until you kicked. It vanished after that.

714
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,240
- You can block this time, right?
 -  Yes, of course.

715
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,590
I'm ready.

716
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,980
Hey, Oliver Kwang.

717
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,270
Kwang Soo. Lie down.

718
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,250
- Lie down in front of the goal.
 -  Okay.

719
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,850
(Lying down? It sounds like a good idea.)

720
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,020
Yes, you can kick the ball. Look at the ball and just kick forward.

721
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,220
(Ji Hyo shoots.)

722
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,450
(Kwang Soo lies down.)

723
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,680
(Did he block the ball?)

724
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,860
It went in.

725
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,280
(Ji Hyo scores a goal.)

726
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,720
- That's it.
 -  It went in.

727
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,850
Well done, Ji Hyo. He helped you score.

728
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,950
- Did it go in?
 -  Yes.

729
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,520
It went in.

730
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,620
Well done, Ji Hyo. He helped you score.

731
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,420
- Did it go in?
 -  Yes.

732
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,180
- If he was standing up...
 -  Then he could've blocked the ball.

733
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
(Their strategy actually helped the other team.)

734
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,320
Why did you tell him to lie down?

735
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,180
You should've lied down earlier. Why did you lie down so late?

736
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,450
- Seung Won is next.
 -  What I mean is...

737
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,220
Ji Hyo is lucky today.

738
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,620
(You guys are hopeless. Let me handle this myself.)

739
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,220
(I know how to kick a ball fairly well.)

740
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,920
Okay. I'm ready.

741
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,450
Go, Seung Won.

742
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,350
- Okay.
 -  Oh, he's good.

743
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,050
He's good.

744
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,320
(He's groping around for the ball.)

745
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,870
(He doesn't fail to disappoint us.)

746
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,620
My gosh.

747
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,250
(Everyone behaves the same with the pair of telescopes.)

748
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,350
We should stand closer to the ball when we kick.

749
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,750
(I must win naengmyun for my teammates.)

750
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,850
(I'll kick you straight to the goal.)

751
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,880
(I was good at football in one of my films.)

752
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,220
(Seung Won scores.)

753
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,550
- Nice.
 -  You scored.

754
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,620
- Nice.
 -  Yeah.

755
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,250
- Nice.
 -  Good kick.

756
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,950
- He scored.
 -  I can't block it.

757
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,530
(The ball went to the corner and went in.)

758
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,180
- Nice.
 -  You scored.

759
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,350
- Nice.
 -  Yes!

760
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,520
(See? I'm good.)

761
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,820
The score is 2 to 1.

762
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,730
- There.
 -  You can do it.

763
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,820
You look like you can see properly even with those glasses.

764
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,650
(Oliver Kwang versus Gary Yashin)

765
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,450
- Get ready.
 -  You can do it.

766
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,020
(Kwang Soo is focusing really hard.)

767
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,080
What a nice kick.

768
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,250
(Gary kicks the ball.)

769
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,350
Nice shooting.

770
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,350
(Oliver Kwang catches the ball.)

771
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,980
Nice.

772
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,020
- Does your knee hurt?
 -  Nice catch.

773
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,480
- Nice. Good job.
 -  Kwang Soo blocked it.

774
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,680
- Nice work.
 -  Why did you fall down?

775
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,850
Well done, Kwang Soo.

776
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,220
- Come on, Kwang Soo.
 -  Good luck.

777
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,400
- Come on.
 -  Let's score.

778
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,350
- Go, Gary Yashin.
 -  Go, Gary.

779
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,000
- They look like aliens.
 -  Let's go.

780
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,020
(A tall alien is looking at the ball...)

781
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,820
Yes, they really do.

782
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,150
(and an ugly alien is trying to block the ball.)

783
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
Good.

784
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,420
It might go in.

785
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,950
- Good.
 -  It might go in.

786
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,520
(Gary blocks the ball.)

787
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,010
Nice.

788
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,530
- Nice.
 -  Good job, Gary. That was so nice.

789
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,150
It's time to eat naengmyun.

790
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,680
- This naengmyun seems so nice.
 -  Sorry, guys.

791
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,080
(Team White has won naengmyun.)

792
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
- People on the internet are...
 -  Gary did really well.

793
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,180
(Yes. It's really delicious.)

794
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,500
(They are looking at them with envy, anger and hunger.)

795
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,820
Well done, Gary.

796
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,200
I really wanted to eat naengmyun.

797
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,420
Give Seung Won a bowl.

798
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,750
He came here to join us today.

799
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,600
I already had a bite. I can't give this to him.

800
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,880
All the shows that I attended with Jae Seok were like this.

801
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,180
- Seung Won, have this.
 -  I was always tired and hungry.

802
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,550
- That's true.
 -  Every single time.

803
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,720
I always give him a hard time.

804
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
- Don't you think so?
 -  It often rained just like today.

805
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,480
- Without any notice.
 -  Yes. Really.

806
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,490
I know the naengmyun is for that team,

807
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,120
but it's always like this with Jae Seok.

808
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,420
- It's really strange.
 -  Can you please order one?

809
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,380
- We will share it together.
 -  No, I'm sorry.

810
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,550
Seung Won has money.

811
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,020
- That's right. He can buy one.
 -  Yes, I can.

812
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,210
Come on.

813
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,850
Then it's okay, I guess.

814
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,750
(I have enough money. Can't you see?)

815
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,950
- Let's have some naengmyun then.
 -  I'll buy you one.

816
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,620
I'll buy you one.

817
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,150
- Really?
 -  Yes, really.

818
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,380
- Okay. Let's have one.
 -  Isn't it okay?

819
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,610
He's buying.

820
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,220
I've met my friends after a long time.

821
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,380
- So he's buying us a meal.
 -  Yes, that's right.

822
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,180
- Okay. We're leaving in 10 minutes.
 -  Then we should eat in 10 minutes.

823
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,680
- Make your orders. Quickly.
 -  Excuse me.

824
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,670
- Can we have one naengmyun?
 -  Order four. I'll pay.

825
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,450
- Four naengmyuns please.
 -  You have to pay by yourself.

826
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,920
- Sure.
 -  Yes. I'll pay.

827
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,420
- Can I order some extra noodles?
 -  Yes, go on.

828
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,520
Order as much as you like. Order some extra noodles.

829
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,750
- I've never seen anyone like him.
 -  Can we have one egg mari, too?

830
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,320
- Egg mari? It's good. Okay.
 -  Yes. Egg mari.

831
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,830
- Order it.
 -  Okay. One egg mari.

832
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,750
- Kimchi kalguksu is on the menu.
 -  Really?

833
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,270
- You're amazing.
 -  Excuse me.

834
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,450
- I'll have kimchi kalguksu instead.
 -  Wait.

835
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,800
Let's check our order again. We're ordering three naengmyun,

836
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,950
one extra noodles, one kimchi kalguksu and two egg mari.

837
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,920
- That's right.
 -  Okay. That's it.

838
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,880
- He's really kind.
 -  Can I have some Sprite, too?

839
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,020
- Stop it. It's too much.
 -  Okay.

840
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,080
Four bottles of Sprite please.

841
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,520
- Four bottles of Sprite, please.
 -  That's right.

842
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,000
- He's amazing.
 -  Four bottles of Sprite, please.

843
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,220
I've never seen anyone who bought meals in the middle of the show.

844
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,620
- He's the first to bring a wallet.
 -  Yes, I have my wallet here.

845
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,320
There were only two people who brought their wallets to...

846
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,080
a TV show. They are Kim Gu Ra and Cha Seung Won.

847
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,580
Gu Ra brings his wallet with him all the time, too.

848
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,080
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

849
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
- Please put it here.
 -  Thank you for the meal.

850
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,850
(Lesson for the day: Always bring your wallet with you.)

851
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,080
I didn't expect this.

852
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,520
(It's delicious.)

853
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,750
- So it means that I'm not wrong.
 -  You're right.

854
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,980
(Where is he going?)

855
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,450
(Here are your cups.)

856
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,920
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you the meal today.

857
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
- My goodness.
 -  Thank you.

858
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,420
- Seung Won is so kind.
 -  He's buying us a meal today.

859
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,310
I wasn't trying to show off. I thought I needed to help them.

860
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,750
- He's so considerate.
 -  He's kind like an angel.

861
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,580
(He's picky but kind.)

862
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,400
(He's so nice.)

863
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,650
We have our egg mari here.

864
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,150
I'm so touched.

865
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,080
He's like the Giving Tree.

866
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,150
It's so delicious.

867
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,250
(Everyone has the equal right to eat.)

868
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,390
- You all finished eating,
 -  It's so delicious.

869
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,990
so we'll give you another map piece.

870
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,220
But we failed to get any.

871
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,850
Thank you.

872
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,550
We'll give you the map to get to the final destination,

873
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,280
but one of the two doesn't have the hint on it.

874
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,220
Please take it for now...

875
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,850
We need one more.

876
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,320
(Seung Won doesn't forget to collect the receipt.)

877
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,650
(You don't have to shoot this.)

878
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,620
(I treated them nicely today.)

879
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,450
We must win this round.

880
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,080
We almost won the "Slap-Match" round, but failed because of her.

881
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,680
Right, my goodness.

882
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
- "Slap-Match".
 -  Gosh.

883
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,820
(I'm the queen of slap-match.)

884
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,620
- My goodness.
 -  Ji Hyo was too good.

885
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,150
- I practised with my father.
 -  Who on earth practises that?

886
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,920
(Ji Hyo practised with her father.)

887
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,380
(Her special instructor was her father.)

888
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,120
(He taught her to hit right in the middle.)

889
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,280
(This is a bad example that you shouldn't follow.)

890
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,320
You shouldn't do like this.

891
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,050
(Thanks to her father, she could win the "Slap-Match" round.)

892
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,520
I will practise table tennis next time.

893
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,380
(Her hard effort didn't betray her.)

894
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,280
(In the fishing quiz mission,)

895
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,050
(she caught a lot of fish.)

896
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,480
Hey, look at this!

897
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,550
- I got it again.
 -  Hey.

898
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,830
(She was good at fishing as well.)

899
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,240
Gosh, what is it? I wasn't going to catch it.

900
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,420
- I haven't heard about it.
 -  Gosh, look at this.

901
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,750
- What is that?
 -  It's a carp!

902
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,320
Goodness, look at this!

903
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,520
(What? You caught a carp?)

904
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,650
(What a shiny carp!)

905
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,820
- I thought...
 -  Is that a carp?

906
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,050
(Lucky Ji Hyo even caught a carp.)

907
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,220
- Really?
 -  Wow!

908
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,520
Ji Hyo!

909
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,320
- I got it.
 -  You've earned extra points.

910
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,620
Okay!

911
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,680
- It's over.
 -  I'll give you a hint, too.

912
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,820
- Okay.
 -  Thank you.

913
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,720
- Thank you.
 -  Good.

914
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,920
Thank you.

915
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,950
(Team Blue earned a map piece and a hint.)

916
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,980
Do you get it?

917
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,420
(Current status: Only Team Blue has a hint.)

918
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,850
(What mission will they do in this fish market?)

919
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,850
- Hello.
 -  Will we have to cook here?

920
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,250
- That must be our mission.
 -  Is it cooking?

921
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,320
What is this?

922
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,570
- What should we do?
 -  What's all this?

923
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,150
We'll give you the last map piece here.

924
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,450
The mission you'll do here is "Relay Cooking".

925
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,420
("Relay Cooking")

926
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
"Relay Cooking"?

927
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,320
Each team will have...

928
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,150
one person who will go shopping and three who will cook here.

929
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,850
One member will go buy the ingredients...

930
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,030
for 15 minutes.

931
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,680
The other three members will cook in relay for 10 minutes each.

932
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,150
You should decide the order among your members.

933
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,880
- We'll give you exactly 45 minutes.
 -  We only have 10 minutes each.

934
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,450
The three members who will cook will wait in the room that's...

935
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,090
equipped with a monitor.

936
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,750
- I see.
 -  So you can't interfere.

937
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,320
You'll come out of the room only when it's your turn.

938
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,150
Jae Seok, you're a good cook.

939
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,420
- By the way,
 -  Fix the orders.

940
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,590
why don't we have any basic sauces?

941
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,300
You have to buy everything.

942
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,230
(Do we even have to make the sauce?)

943
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,480
15 minutes won't be enough.

944
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,280
(This sounds pretty difficult.)

945
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
- You'll tell us what to cook?
 -  Of course, I will.

946
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Gary should go shopping.

947
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,450
(Gary has lived alone for a long time.)

948
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,050
- First...
 -  You should buy...

949
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,750
- Buy sugar and salt.
 -  We need some soy sauce.

950
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,350
We need soy sauce, starch syrup, red pepper powder and so on.

951
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,850
These are basic ingredients.

952
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,450
- Buy everything that you see.
 -  Don't forget soy sauce.

953
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,290
(I got it.)

954
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,450
There's a basic procedure you should follow when you cook.

955
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,980
Put the ingredients first. Then pour water in and the sauce.

956
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,250
(Ingredients should be put in first.)

957
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,290
What if I want to make the sauce?

958
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,920
I don't think we'll have enough time to do that.

959
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,520
- We need doenjang and gochujang.
 -  Doenjang and gochujang?

960
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,280
Buy doenjang, gochujang and artificial flavouring.

961
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,480
- MSG?
 -  Yes.

962
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,180
How will you decide the winning team?

963
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,650
- You'll see soon.
 -  Really?

964
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,720
(How will they decide the winning team?)

965
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
(Hello.)

966
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,220
Look at him. He's cute.

967
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,630
(We're watching you.)

968
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,230
Both teams will cook the same menu.

969
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,280
Doenjang and gochujang.

970
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,820
Don't forget MSG.

971
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,880
Kwang Soo.

972
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,550
Doenjang, gochujang, red pepper powder and MSG.

973
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,090
(Don't forget to buy the artificial flavouring.)

974
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,730
It's very important...

975
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,350
to taste food at the proper time.

976
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,150
Ingredients determine 50 percent of the taste, right?

977
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,550
It's no exaggeration to say it takes up about 80 percent.

978
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,750
Fresh ingredients are the key in cooking.

979
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,180
Fresh ingredients can determine a dish's whole taste.

980
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,570
I don't know what they'll cook today,

981
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,050
but the role of the first player is very critical.

982
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,150
We need a strategy today.

983
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,850
One member should spend the entire 10 minutes making the sauce.

984
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,680
- Haha is good at it.
 -  And...

985
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,250
I will prepare the ingredients. I'm good at it.

986
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,350
Seung Won will cook first.

987
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,920
I'll be second and Jae Seok will be the last.

988
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,680
Am I the last one?

989
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,380
- I'll go last then.
 -  Good.

990
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,320
Who will prepare the ingredients?

991
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,950
I'll take charge of it.

992
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,860
- Are you good at using knives?
 -  Not really.

993
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,820
We'll tell you today's menu and count down right away.

994
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,680
This is what you'll cook today.

995
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,320
(This is the last chance to obtain the last map piece.)

996
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,250
(What would they cook today?)

997
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,700
It's nakji jeongol! Start!

998
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,880
- It's nakji jeongol! Start!
 -  Nakji jeongol?

999
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,680
(They're off to buy the ingredients.)

1000
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,750
Start.

1001
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,720
It's nakji jeongol! Start!

1002
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,750
- Nakji jeongol?
 -  Start!

1003
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,590
- It's nakji jeongol! Start!
 -  What?

1004
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,720
- Kwang Soo!
 -  Make sure you buy small octopus.

1005
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,980
Buy small octopus, radish, spicy pepper... Gosh.

1006
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,280
- The menu is nakji jeongol.
 -  I see.

1007
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,920
They shouldn't buy hard or tough small octopus.

1008
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,020
They're not good for nakji jeongol.

1009
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,020
I hope they buy fresh small octopus in dark brown colour.

1010
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,120
What are the basic ingredients of nakji jeongol?

1011
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,750
- Of course, small octopus.
 -  Right.

1012
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,480
- I usually add some radish.
 -  Radish?

1013
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,950
- It'd be good if they added clams.
 -  Clams?

1014
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,090
Yes. I'd also add some crown daisy.

1015
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,680
They need to buy green onion and garlic.

1016
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,380
When I make the sauce,

1017
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,420
I usually put some fish sauce to make it more savoury.

1018
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,120
I hope they also add some fish sauce, too.

1019
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,180
(Which team will get a map piece in this round?)

1020
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,420
- Nakji jeongol.
 -  Nakji jeongol?

1021
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,150
- Is this...
 -  I don't know what to buy.

1022
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,320
- the right way to the fish market?
 -  It is.

1023
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,220
(These two head to the fish market.)

1024
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,120
Let's go to the supermarket first.

1025
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,020
(He runs.)

1026
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,220
Sauce...

1027
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,680
I'll buy the basic ingredients first.

1028
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,650
(Kwang Soo, you don't even know what's important, right?)

1029
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,090
Where is he?

1030
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,420
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

1031
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,480
- Where can I buy small octopus?
 -  Here.

1032
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,720
- Right there.
 -  I'm making nakji jeongol today.

1033
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,520
How much is it?

1034
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,750
- It's 3 for 10 dollars.
 -  I'll have 3 then.

1035
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,720
- You need big ones for jeongol.
 -  Look at this. It's big.

1036
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,150
- Really? Then give me two, please.
 -  Two?

1037
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,950
Where is he?

1038
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,920
He's over there.

1039
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,110
Hello.

1040
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,120
What do I need to make nakji jeongol?

1041
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,720
What does he need to make nakji jeongol?

1042
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,480
- Add mushroom and water parsley.
 -  Okay.

1043
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,620
- Water parsley and...
 -  Radish.

1044
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,720
- You also need clam broth.
 -  Clam broth?

1045
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,750
- Do I need clams?
 -  You do.

1046
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,820
Please give me some.

1047
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,380
Give me everything I need.

1048
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,700
- You can't ask her.
 -  What are you talking about?

1049
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,280
- I just bought small octopus.
 -  He's right.

1050
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,950
- He asked you what to buy, right?
 -  I bout small octopus. That's it.

1051
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,750
- I want everything he bought here.
 -  Okay.

1052
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,400
No way. Go away.

1053
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,260
Please give me everything he bought. I'll come back and pay for it.

1054
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,620
- I want the same ingredients.
 -  Wait. I'm talking to her.

1055
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,050
Ma'am, what is this?

1056
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,170
Please give me the same.

1057
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,280
- Wait, she's mine!
 -  What are you talking about?

1058
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,980
- I said, she's mine.
 -  She's mine.

1059
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,120
Go find your own woman.

1060
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,930
- Please give me the same.
 -  No, stop it.

1061
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,150
I want what he bought.

1062
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,950
Please give me small octopus!

1063
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,270
(Ma'am, please tell me the rest of the ingredients.)

1064
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,720
Wait. Come on.

1065
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,180
You can't do this.

1066
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,650
- What else do I need?
 -  You also need some kelp.

1067
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,820
(He has gathered all the information.)

1068
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,150
- Miss, keep it a secret.
 -  Okay.

1069
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,320
(Please keep it a secret.)

1070
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,880
Kwang Soo should get everything we need.

1071
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,680
- He's not reliable.
 -  I should've gone instead.

1072
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,480
- He'll ask others.
 -  Would he?

1073
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,850
- He would if he has a brain.
 -  Right.

1074
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,390
He wouldn't omit the small octopus just to make this show funny, right?

1075
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,160
Nakji jeongol without small octopus doesn't make any sense.

1076
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,850
I want some abalones.

1077
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,680
Please give me three abalones...

1078
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,590
and five shrimps.

1079
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,980
(He hasn't bought small octopus yet.)

1080
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,680
I'd also like three spoon worms.

1081
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,450
- How much is this?
 -  This one?

1082
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,480
It's 38 dollars per kg.

1083
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,180
38 dollars per kg? That's too expensive.

1084
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,750
No one puts lobster in nakji jeongol.

1085
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,820
What do I need then? Isn't it the same as maeuntang?

1086
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,950
(Gary is at the supermarket.)

1087
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,380
(This is the list of the ingredients Hye Jeong recommended.)

1088
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,450
Radish and green onion.

1089
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,250
Should I add some bean sprouts with water parsley?

1090
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,880
Where is water parsley?

1091
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,250
- Do you want me to wrap it?
 -  Yes, please.

1092
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,690
- Soy sauce.
 -  Here it is.

1093
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,090
Here's ground garlic.

1094
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,680
Where is red pepper powder?

1095
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,520
- What are you looking for?
 -  Red pepper powder.

1096
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,750
- Red pepper powder?
 -  Kwang Soo, why are you here?

1097
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,320
Ramyeon.

1098
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,420
Make sure you buy artificial flavouring.

1099
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,020
(He buys ramyeon as Seung Won told him to.)

1100
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,480
What else should I buy?

1101
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,620
Water parsley, green onion and onion. Where's water parsley?

1102
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,220
I'll buy everything Gary bought.

1103
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,550
Please give me his receipt.

1104
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,380
You're not supposed to use MSG when you cook.

1105
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,750
You're nasty.

1106
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,750
I'll put them in.

1107
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,750
- Time's up for grocery shopping.
 -  Yes, it's done.

1108
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,020
Okay, let's pay for them.

1109
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,850
- So are you done with the grocery?
 -  Yes.

1110
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,420
Please stand at your table.

1111
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,450
- Here they come.
 -  Yes.

1112
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,720
- They bought the ingredients.
 -  They are relaxed.

1113
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,520
Kwang Soo bought a lot but Gary didn't buy much.

1114
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,540
Kwang Soo bought a lot of ingredients.

1115
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,250
He bought a lot.

1116
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,950
Please show what you've bought.

1117
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,120
I bought kelp, Cheongyang chilli,

1118
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,050
- mushrooms...
 -  Really?

1119
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,480
- Mushrooms,
 -  Mushrooms?

1120
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,030
- radish,
 -  Radish is great.

1121
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,350
green onions,

1122
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,380
onions,

1123
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,050
soy sauce, water parsley...

1124
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,130
and small octopus.

1125
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,550
I think Gary bought proper ingredients.

1126
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,250
There were onion, garlic and so on.

1127
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,850
He was smart with his shopping.

1128
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,940
- He has red pepper powder.
 -  Great.

1129
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,620
(Good job.)

1130
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,360
Good job.

1131
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,380
I bought ramyeon.

1132
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,640
He wanted to use the seasoning powder.

1133
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,250
Gochujang,

1134
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,220
- doenjang,
 -  That's right.

1135
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,550
- bean sprouts,
 -  Good.

1136
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,020
- water parsley.
 -  Well done.

1137
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,070
Good.

1138
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,080
And stir-fried small octopus.

1139
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,150
(Stir-fried octopus for nakji jeongol?)

1140
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,250
Why did he buy that?

1141
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,380
He didn't forget small octopus, did he?

1142
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,750
Is it okay to buy stir-fried small octopus?

1143
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,820
You shouldn't buy ready-made food.

1144
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,550
I don't understand him.

1145
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,320
- Show me small octopus.
 -  Kelp.

1146
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,150
- Please, small octopus.
 -  Right.

1147
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,250
- There should be small octopus.
 -  Yes.

1148
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,420
- Is he confused?
 -  Small octopus please.

1149
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,320
- Cabbage.
 -  We don't need that.

1150
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,580
There should be small octopus.

1151
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,950
That must be small octopus.

1152
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,250
(Show me the small octopus.)

1153
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,250
Crabs.

1154
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,170
(Crabs?)

1155
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,180
Crabs.

1156
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,980
Why the crabs?

1157
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,600
- Isn't it cheating?
 -  Next is...

1158
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,320
- Buying crabs is cheating.
 -  Clams.

1159
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,020
Crabs will make it delicious.

1160
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,750
Abalones.

1161
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,220
(What?)

1162
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,380
Kwang Soo even bought abalones.

1163
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,180
How much did he spend for this nakji jeongol?

1164
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,050
He swept everything at the supermarket.

1165
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,380
- Did he even buy small octopus?
 -  Small octopus.

1166
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,720
(Small octopus, please.)

1167
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,180
Small octopus.

1168
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,250
(Here comes the small octopus.)

1169
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,810
- Okay.
 -  Good.

1170
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,020
- We'll use abalones, clams...
 -  Okay.

1171
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,880
and small octopus.

1172
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,440
For vegetables, we'll use green onions and bean sprouts.

1173
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,850
- I'll prep the ingredients.
 -  Bean sprouts.

1174
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,810
Bean sprouts and mushrooms.

1175
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,920
We'll start the timer. The first chefs, please come out.

1176
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,170
- It has started.
 -  Please come out.

1177
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,750
- Chop the green onions.
 -  Let's go.

1178
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,350
- Let's start.
 -  It's okay.

1179
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,350
Check how fresh the small octopus is.

1180
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,590
We should put the vegetables in later, right?

1181
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,950
Put the vegetables in later.

1182
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,650
- Time is passing.
 -  Boil the water first.

1183
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,340
- Today's menu is nakji jeongol.
 -  Yes.

1184
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,980
First of all, small octopus should be tender.

1185
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,550
Since it is jeongol,

1186
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,070
there should be enough soup.

1187
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,050
- That's what jeongol should be.
 -  Right.

1188
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,430
It looks easy to make jeongol, but depending on...

1189
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,440
how you cook the small octopus,

1190
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,710
it can be as soft as willows or as tough as a bark.

1191
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,450
It can be tough like a branch.

1192
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,790
So we'll wait and watch what they will make.

1193
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,480
Boil the water first.

1194
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,620
- Clams.
 -  Okay.

1195
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,550
- Boil the water first.
 -  Okay.

1196
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,950
- Water.
 -  Boil some water.

1197
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,150
It's not fair to coach him.

1198
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,220
Don't coach him what to do.

1199
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,020
- Stop, Jae Seok.
 -  They're controlling him.

1200
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
Put some water.

1201
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,380
- Put some water.
 -  They should stay quiet.

1202
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,520
Put in the water!

1203
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,720
- You too, Seok Jin!
 -  More, more.

1204
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,450
More, more.

1205
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,080
I can clearly hear them.

1206
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,630
- More, more!
 -  Am I their puppet?

1207
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,320
- More. That's enough.
 -  I can hear them.

1208
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,980
- Stop.
 -  Stop!

1209
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,950
- Stop.
 -  Okay, that's enough.

1210
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
(You're my puppet chef.)

1211
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,820
What is this?

1212
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,020
This is not a relay.

1213
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,950
Look. Ji Hyo poured enough water...

1214
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,160
to make soup for jeongol...

1215
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,750
but Haha's water is not enough at all.

1216
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,580
You need plenty of water for that.

1217
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,440
Ji Hyo, there are clams.

1218
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,950
- What?
 -  He bought clams.

1219
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,550
He bought clams?

1220
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,280
- Wash the clams.
 -  Do I have to wash the clams?

1221
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,680
- Get rid of the mud.
 -  Get rid of the mud.

1222
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,220
- Gochujang!
 -  Two spoonfuls of it.

1223
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,220
(He's putting in doenjang.)

1224
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,050
Stop pouring now.

1225
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,530
(Your wish is my command.)

1226
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,480
It would be better for him to do it all.

1227
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,820
- What is he putting?
 -  What is it?

1228
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,350
- It's doenjang.
 -  It looks like doenjang.

1229
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,750
That's too much. That's bad.

1230
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,380
It's not doenjang jjigae.

1231
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,450
He put in too much doenjang...

1232
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,140
- compared to the water.
 -  I know.

1233
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,250
Open it quickly.

1234
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,920
Okay, pour it in.

1235
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,580
(He is remote-controlling Haha.)

1236
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,350
More, more. Now, stop.

1237
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,480
- Stop.
 -  Cover the brand name.

1238
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,820
Turn the ramyeon around so that the brand name won't be shown.

1239
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,750
Turn the ramyeon. Okay.

1240
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,320
It doesn't matter.

1241
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,720
Be quiet, please.

1242
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,220
Please be quiet.

1243
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,450
- Goodness.
 -  Do you own this restaurant?

1244
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,680
- Take the plastic away from fire.
 -  Be careful.

1245
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,620
Seung Won told you to take the plastic away from the fire.

1246
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,480
Take the plastic away from the fire.

1247
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,820
It's dangerous.

1248
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,450
- Dissolve the doenjang.
 -  This is not right.

1249
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,850
- Resolve it.
 -  Just come out here.

1250
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,720
Haha is just busy with the doenjang.

1251
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,250
- It'll be doenjang jjigae.
 -  Maybe.

1252
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,330
Put in a third of a ladle of red pepper powder.

1253
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,170
A third of a ladle is enough.

1254
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,250
- A third of it.
 -  A third.

1255
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,250
(Haha got used to the orders.)

1256
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,250
- Okay. That's enough.
 -  Okay.

1257
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,650
Now, put in the vegetables. Put them in.

1258
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,380
This is not a relay.

1259
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,470
What kind of a cooking competition is this?

1260
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,250
This is nonsense.

1261
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,430
It's not fair to coach a player when they play.

1262
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,150
While preparing the broth,

1263
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,900
you should wash the ingredients.

1264
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,920
Ji Hyo went to wash the ingredients.

1265
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,080
(Smart Ji Hyo washes the ingredients.)

1266
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,220
Loot at her.

1267
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,850
- She brought a strainer.
 -  She is smart.

1268
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,750
- Women are good at this.
 -  Right.

1269
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,650
She puts them in after washing.

1270
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,980
(She looks feminine today.)

1271
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,830
- She's back.
 -  She's here.

1272
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,520
What did she wash?

1273
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,920
- Green onions...
 -  She puts the clams in first.

1274
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,540
There she goes.

1275
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,120
She is doing great.

1276
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,280
Did she get rid of the mud?

1277
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,850
- Should I put in the radish?
 -  Cut the radish.

1278
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,840
- Cut the radish.
 -  Cut the radish.

1279
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,230
Cut them into big pieces.

1280
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,920
- Big pieces.
 -  That's good.

1281
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,850
You're doing great.

1282
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,250
That's enough. Put it in.

1283
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,320
Look how well she is doing.

1284
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,730
She knows how to cook.

1285
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,020
- Take your time.
 -  Take your time.

1286
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,420
Don't put in too much Cheongyang chilli.

1287
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,470
Let's see how she does.

1288
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,350
She's good.

1289
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,820
- She's good.
 -  You're good.

1290
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,850
You can get married.

1291
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,890
Cut them into bigger pieces.

1292
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,380
- Bigger pieces?
 -  Look.

1293
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,170
I was going to put these into the sauce.

1294
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,370
- That's okay.
 -  Was it for the sauce?

1295
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,340
- It was for the sauce.
 -  Good.

1296
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,960
- She is doing great.
 -  Not bad.

1297
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,240
You need two stems of green onions.

1298
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,010
- Two stems.
 -  Two stems.

1299
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,080
Two fresh stems.

1300
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,720
No. I mean the ones in your right hand.

1301
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,080
- Yes.
 -  Right.

1302
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,820
- Diagonally.
 -  Cut them diagonally.

1303
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,250
Cut them into 1cm long.

1304
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,750
That's bigger than 1cm!

1305
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,550
- Calm down.
 -  It's okay.

1306
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,530
Tell them they need to calm down.

1307
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,020
Haha didn't wash anything at all.

1308
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,220
I know. Maybe he's not going to wash his ingredients.

1309
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,620
He just unwrapped the chilli and is now cutting it.

1310
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,050
- You bought kelp.
 -  Yes.

1311
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,450
Cut it 10cm by 10cm.

1312
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,250
- 10 by 10.
 -  10 by 10.

1313
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,650
10cm by 10cm.

1314
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,650
Good.

1315
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,330
Cut it in half.

1316
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,750
We need some more.

1317
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,750
- Okay, put it in.
 -  Shall I put it in?

1318
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,970
- Okay.
 -  That's enough.

1319
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,240
That's enough.

1320
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,820
- That's enough!
 -  Do as you're told.

1321
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,720
- This soup doesn't look good.
 -  That's because of the doenjang.

1322
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,720
There will not be enough soup left.

1323
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,810
You're right.

1324
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,350
I'll go next.

1325
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,920
I think you should go next.

1326
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,850
How can I finalise the food then?

1327
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,120
- I'll almost finish it.
 -  Okay.

1328
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,650
You have 30 more seconds left.

1329
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,250
Put in the bean sprouts.

1330
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,450
Just two handfuls.

1331
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,650
That's too much.

1332
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,720
- He said two handfuls.
 -  Just two.

1333
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,750
15 seconds!

1334
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,050
I'll get going.

1335
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,820
- Go, Seung Won.
 -  Go, go.

1336
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,650
You have to actually finish cooking.

1337
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,030
You should almost finish it.

1338
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,080
Ji Hyo preps the ingredients very well.

1339
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,550
She is good.

1340
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,820
Haha you should come to the table.

1341
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,650
Time's up. It's the second chefs turn.

1342
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,850
Second chef, please come out.

1343
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,150
Come out.

1344
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,220
- Drop what you're doing.
 -  Okay. It's my turn.

1345
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,350
Go, Seung Won.

1346
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,380
(The second chef of Team Blue is Seung Won.)

1347
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,750
(Here comes Seung Won.)

1348
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,220
Good job.

1349
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,220
- You're not the last chef.
 -  No, I'm not.

1350
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,150
I washed the bean sprouts.

1351
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,480
- Hurry up.
 -  Seok Jin is here.

1352
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,720
See? Seung Won comes in the middle.

1353
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,480
- Right.
 -  The order is important.

1354
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,040
As you said, he comes third...

1355
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,720
to almost finalise the food and pass it onto Jae Seok.

1356
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,160
I think so.

1357
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,250
- The beansprouts are over there.
 -  Okay.

1358
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,750
I left them there.

1359
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,730
- Good job.
 -  It was so hectic.

1360
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,540
- Good job.
 -  You did well.

1361
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,620
Now, we don't need to tell him to do anything.

1362
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,050
Where are the bean sprouts?

1363
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,430
Over there.

1364
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,750
They are well prepared.

1365
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,220
You said you wanted to know Seung Won's cooking.

1366
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,250
Yes, I'm curious.

1367
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,580
- How would he...
 -  Let's see how he cooks.

1368
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Let's see.

1369
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,050
I think they sell washed ones.

1370
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,350
(He pours water to make it less salty.)

1371
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,710
He doesn't measure.

1372
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,330
- Seung Won added water.
 -  Yes.

1373
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,080
It might have turned into a steamed dish...

1374
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,680
or it could have been ruined...

1375
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,690
but Seung Won added some water.

1376
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,980
He's working very hard.

1377
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,640
He's working without rest.

1378
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,720
It's like a cooking competition show.

1379
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,450
(I will revive this jeongol at all costs.)

1380
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,620
Seung Won isn't the last player.

1381
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,320
- Are you putting in sauce?
 -  He's adding sauce.

1382
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,500
- That's a lot.
 -  Seok Jin is adding the whole...

1383
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,200
gochujang pack.

1384
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,220
- He's still managing to make...
 -  Right.

1385
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,820
- the sauce in a bowl.
 -  Exactly.

1386
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,880
Ji Hyo added two of those.

1387
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,240
- Wash the small octopus!
 -  Okay.

1388
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,750
Two minutes has passed.

1389
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,080
Two minutes? Already?

1390
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,820
You have to wash the small octopus now!

1391
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,050
- The small octopus!
 -  Okay!

1392
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,230
- We're going to win.
 -  Is Seok Jin in slow motion?

1393
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,750
What's he doing?

1394
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,620
It's very important how one handles the small octopus.

1395
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,450
It's the most important. It's important how tender...

1396
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,050
and chewy one can make it.

1397
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,980
This is so difficult.

1398
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,710
(Seok Jin barely catches up and begins to wash the small octopus.)

1399
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,050
- Are you finished already?
 -  Yes.

1400
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,280
(Screaming)

1401
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,720
My gosh, it's alive!

1402
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,950
(The small octopus is still alive.)

1403
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,350
Oh my goodness. This isn't easy.

1404
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,980
(Seok Jin is startled.)

1405
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,720
I was really frightened. I'm not joking.

1406
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,350
(Screaming)

1407
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,580
He should've left it to me.

1408
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,960
I can wash it before we put it in.

1409
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,320
Gosh, it's not easy.

1410
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,450
(Seok Jin returns.)

1411
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,680
Why isn't this boiling?

1412
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,220
Look at the lid. Close the lid properly!

1413
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,480
(You keep opening the lid.)

1414
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,180
- What?
 -  Close the lid properly.

1415
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,880
If you keep opening it, it won't boil even more.

1416
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,380
Can you be quiet?

1417
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,750
Hurry up and close it.

1418
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,080
- You surprised me.
 -  You can't come out here.

1419
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,220
Why is he opening the lid?

1420
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,520
- Don't add the bean sprouts now.
 -  What's wrong?

1421
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,200
What did I do wrong? Why are they yelling at me?

1422
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,350
If you add the bean sprouts now, won't it get soggy?

1423
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,450
Will it be soggy?

1424
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,080
Do you add it as a whole?

1425
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,450
He's cutting it up.

1426
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,820
- Goodness, he's great at this.
 -  He cuts off the ink.

1427
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,150
- Right.
 -  The eyes, too.

1428
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,550
(He chops with charisma.)

1429
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,650
He's so sexy.

1430
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,550
- It's a master technique.
 -  Do you add it already?

1431
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,980
It's important how tender and chewy you make the small octopus.

1432
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,450
Won't the small octopus get stiff if you add it too quickly?

1433
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,020
(Won't the small octopus get stiff if you add it too quickly?)

1434
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,650
You can add it as a whole after boiling the soup.

1435
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,750
You can cut it with the scissors after it cooks.

1436
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,350
It's a big minus for the main ingredient to get stiff.

1437
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,520
(It's a big loss.)

1438
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,380
(Seung Won continues to add the small octopus.)

1439
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,220
We don't have to worry.

1440
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,470
- You surprised me.
 -  You can't come out here.

1441
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,120
He just adds the whole thing.

1442
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,320
Seok Jin is just making the sauce after washing the small octopus.

1443
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,450
The other team added the octopus too early so it may be stiff.

1444
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,160
- Seok Jin isn't putting it in yet.
 -  Right.

1445
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,410
I'm curious to know if he simply forgot about it or if it's intended.

1446
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,380
- This is...
 -  Gary, did you buy the sugar?

1447
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,450
Close the lid. You don't have to take that out.

1448
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,120
- Right. I'll take it out.
 -  There are too much bubbles.

1449
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,420
- They said not to take it out.
 -  Seok Jin.

1450
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,670
Stop taking that out and just close the lid so it can boil.

1451
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,280
Just come back.

1452
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,880
This tastes good if you eat it now.

1453
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,750
Just close the lid already!

1454
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,240
- Stop it!
 -  Stop.

1455
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,410
- Close the lid!
 -  He won't keep it closed.

1456
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,850
- I have to open it to add things.
 -  He's not keeping it closed again.

1457
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,740
- Add the clams.
 -  We bought the pickled shrimp.

1458
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,750
Okay.

1459
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,350
Where is it?

1460
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,880
- It looks great.
 -  It's in front of you!

1461
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,380
- Oh, it's here.
 -  Right.

1462
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,910
He's so skilled.

1463
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,420
- Jae Seok can add water parsleys...
 -  Add onions and the small octopus.

1464
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,480
(Seung Won adds various vegetables.)

1465
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,620
(Team Blue's nakji jeongol is almost complete.)

1466
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,920
Look at ours.

1467
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,320
We're almost done. You can say that we're almost finished.

1468
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,520
If it just tastes good.

1469
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,880
I don't know if I'm making it the right way.

1470
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,250
- That...
 -  Make the sauce.

1471
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,550
(It's up to Jong Kook to revive it.)

1472
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,080
- Five seconds left.
 -  Add the water parsley.

1473
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,060
- The results...
 -  I should wash the water parsley.

1474
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,000
- Add the mushrooms later.
 -  Jae Seok, get ready.

1475
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,750
- Okay, let's go!
 -  Change players.

1476
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,950
- Add more vegetables.
 -  Go in, please.

1477
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,080
- Jae Seok,
 -  It's already...

1478
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,750
taste it and add just a bit of...

1479
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,680
- the ends of the water parsley.
 -  The clams!

1480
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,550
- Just a little bit.
 -  Add the small octopus last.

1481
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,680
- Okay.
 -  Just taste it.

1482
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,510
- Taste it for flavour.
 -  Okay.

1483
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,420
- Taste it.
 -  The scent is already...

1484
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,410
- great. I'll add the clams.
 -  What is this?

1485
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,250
What's wrong with this sauce?

1486
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,650
- What is that?
 -  What...

1487
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,530
(It looks awful as well.)

1488
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,650
It's lacking sweet flavour.

1489
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,980
- Jae Seok,
 -  Yes?

1490
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,120
just wash five clams in the kitchen.

1491
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,450
- Good. Just five.
 -  That's enough!

1492
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,950
That's plenty. Don't add too much.

1493
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,720
You'll fall! Be careful.

1494
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,200
(Jae Seok is washing the clams for the nakji jeongol.)

1495
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,050
The clams should've gone in earlier.

1496
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,970
- They should've put it in earlier.
 -  That's right.

1497
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,120
The clams should be added first like Ji Hyo did...

1498
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,050
- to create a hearty taste.
 -  Right.

1499
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,750
Make the clam broth first.

1500
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,550
- He's not going to add the sauce.
 -  You can add more!

1501
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,580
I'm going to add more!

1502
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,050
Are you going to change it to a non-spicy soup?

1503
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,200
I'm curious as to when he will add the small octopus.

1504
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,650
You have to add the small octopus and water parsley now.

1505
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,310
Put it in as a whole.

1506
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,080
- Do I add it as a whole?
 -  Just put it in as a whole.

1507
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,280
- Just put it in.
 -  Cut it after it cooks.

1508
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,350
- Put it in. Good job.
 -  Add one more!

1509
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,580
- You should cut it first.
 -  Put it all in.

1510
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,020
- Don't you have to cut it first?
 -  No. Just put it in.

1511
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,050
You usually cut it with scissors after it cooks.

1512
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,480
The ink bursts if you cut it first.

1513
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,720
(The small octopus is added last.)

1514
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,950
Did they add the octopus now?

1515
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,550
- It's tender when it's added last.
 -  Small octopus...

1516
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,920
- isn't supposed to be added first.
 -  Close the lid. It has to boil.

1517
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,350
It has to boil for three minutes and we're done.

1518
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,850
Doesn't this look like a dish from a skilled restaurant?

1519
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,020
- You're right.
 -  Doesn't it?

1520
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,640
It looks like it's from a very famous restaurant.

1521
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,750
- Jae Seok, taste it for flavour.
 -  Okay.

1522
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,180
(Team Blue's nakji jeongol is almost complete.)

1523
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,490
- The small octopus is done.
 -  It tastes good.

1524
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,480
- It tastes pretty good, Seung Won.
 -  Does it taste good?

1525
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,920
It tastes good.

1526
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,380
- There are 30 seconds left.
 -  I usually eat blandly.

1527
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,450
I wanted to make a clear soup like that.

1528
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,320
Okay. Let's make ours clear and not spicy.

1529
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,970
Yeonpotang tastes better than nakji jeongol.

1530
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,280
- There are 20 seconds left.
 -  I can...

1531
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,950
I can make this taste so much better if I add one more.

1532
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,550
Of course, you can.

1533
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,850
- Four, three...
 -  Should I add red pepper powder?

1534
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,580
two and one.

1535
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,920
Time is over.

1536
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,150
(Who will be the winner in the small octopus cook-off?)

1537
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,550
(Time over)

1538
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,080
We said that we have panellists here.

1539
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,060
- Yes.
 -  We'll have them join us now.

1540
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,250
- Do we have judges?
 -  Please come in.

1541
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,880
Who are the panellists?

1542
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,480
- What?
 -  Isn't that...

1543
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,720
- Who is it?
 -  Again?

1544
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,380
- Hye Jeong.
 -  My goodness.

1545
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,450
When did you get here?

1546
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,380
- Come over here.
 -  Please come here.

1547
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,480
Come here.

1548
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,950
- When did you get here?
 -  Hello.

1549
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,580
- Hi.
 -  Hello.

1550
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,080
I'm watching you carefully.

1551
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
(I've had my eye on you.)

1552
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,650
They've been watching you guys cook the whole time.

1553
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,250
- Is that so?
 -  Yes. They were inside.

1554
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,900
- So everything can be judged.
 -  My gosh.

1555
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,920
Can you tell us your exact standards for evaluation?

1556
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,380
My first standard is whether or not...

1557
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,480
- the completed dish is edible.
 -  That's right.

1558
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,080
So it's not whether or not it tastes good.

1559
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,100
It's a bit difficult to discuss good taste here.

1560
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,740
That's my first standard.

1561
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,600
I watched Seung Won very carefully today.

1562
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,820
It should be enough that he's handsome,

1563
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,880
but he's taking away our jobs by cooking well too.

1564
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,520
He cooks very well though.

1565
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,310
What surprised me was...

1566
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,120
the way he cleaned and organised the area like professionals do.

1567
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,450
- Not anyone can do that.
 -  You're right.

1568
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:04,620
(This is me.)

1569
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,350
- But just one thing is...
 -  Don't laugh like that...

1570
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,150
- in front of Hye Jeong.
 -  that he cooks a bit arrogantly.

1571
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,250
He pours the red pepper powder with the entire bottle.

1572
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,950
If you make a mistake, you can pour too much.

1573
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,610
It was nice to be able to catch a fault in him.

1574
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:21,940
It was impressive to see Jong Kook wiping his hands when he came out.

1575
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,210
You are right.

1576
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,650
That's the least he can do.

1577
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,220
(It's a given.)

1578
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,250
He should do that at least.

1579
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,750
- Okay, Hye Jeong.
 -  Yes.

1580
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,650
- Please give a fair evaluation.
 -  Hwan, you should try some too.

1581
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,250
(How will Team Blue's taste?)

1582
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,870
- If you try it, it tastes decent.
 -  Right.

1583
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,250
- It smells nice.
 -  Doesn't it?

1584
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,320
We did well.

1585
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,220
(How well did Seung Won's skills seep into the dish?)

1586
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,450
- This is the right colour.
 -  Right.

1587
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,670
(It's delicious!)

1588
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,750
It's delicious.

1589
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,880
Haha did well. His throwing in of doenjang helped.

1590
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,670
- She said "throwing in".
 -  It helped to match the flavour.

1591
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,750
It's true.

1592
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,240
- It's so delicious.
 -  Seung Won added red pepper powder.

1593
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,080
This created a great harmony between the doenjang and gochujang.

1594
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,920
(Exclaiming)

1595
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,670
- The doenjang is delicious.
 -  Isn't it?

1596
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,080
The small octopus isn't stiff either.

1597
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,350
- It's unexpected.
 -  Right.

1598
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,340
This dish is edible.

1599
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,220
(This dish is edible.)

1600
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,720
- Great. We can eat it.
 -  It's edible!

1601
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,480
In terms of meat, it's like grilled meat instead of seasoned meat.

1602
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,320
- I see.
 -  It looks good.

1603
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,970
- We avoided any kicks in flavour.
 -  I see.

1604
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,120
Isn't it okay?

1605
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,880
How did they make it?

1606
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,050
Isn't it hearty?

1607
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,620
I personally don't like adding salt.

1608
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,550
- Adding white radish...
 -  Yes.

1609
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,420
made it extremely refreshing.

1610
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,520
We also added the small octopus last.

1611
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,750
It must taste refreshing.

1612
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,620
The small octopus is more tender than Team Blue.

1613
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,250
- That's right.
 -  We put it in last.

1614
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,380
- That's what we were aiming for.
 -  Ji Hyo also added the clams first.

1615
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,850
The soup brewed out from the clams and made it more refreshing.

1616
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,880
I have a slight cold right now, but I feel like my cold has disappeared.

1617
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,950
(The clam soup healed her cold.)

1618
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,600
It's a great dish for healing.

1619
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,450
Both of these dishes are edible.

1620
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,420
The delicious nakji jeongol that we usually eat is here.

1621
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,220
- But that side...
 -  Yes?

1622
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:21,020
Team White had less ingredients and Team Blue had more,

1623
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,150
- so there's an advantage with that.
 -  Right.

1624
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,820
(Which team's dish did the panellists like more?)

1625
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,180
But I still choose this team.

1626
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,980
(Blue Team wins "Relay Cooking".)

1627
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,750
- We won.
 -  Hurrah.

1628
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,820
We won.

1629
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,280
(He bows to express gratitude.)

1630
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,980
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1631
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,520
- Thank you.
 -  You did a good job.

1632
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,680
- It's delicious.
 -  Thank you.

1633
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,420
- Try some.
 -  I want some soup.

1634
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,120
- Gary, try some.
 -  It's delicious.

1635
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,480
Yes, it's very delicious.

1636
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,450
(Small octopus looks nice and chewy.)

1637
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,220
Kwang Soo.

1638
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,020
- Ours is delicious.
 -  It is.

1639
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,130
It's really good.

1640
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,950
- I love how it tastes.
 -  It's delicious.

1641
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,450
- Try some.
 -  I love how it tastes.

1642
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,550
(Spicy nakji jeongol is appetising.)

1643
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,250
- I love this taste.
 -  Kwang Soo would love it.

1644
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,410
- This is very good.
 -  It has an interesting taste.

1645
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:14,880
Both of them are delicious.

1646
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,520
(Today, they put their cooking skills to a good use.)

1647
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,130
You just finished your mission.

1648
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,020
Once you get the last piece,

1649
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,740
you can discuss and figure out the final destination.

1650
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,470
We'll give you the last piece when you get to your car.

1651
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,640
At the final destination, you'll find a map platform.

1652
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,650
With the maps and hints you collected today,

1653
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,320
you'll be able to complete the map.

1654
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:47,150
(The 2 teams obtained hints and map pieces during 4 missions.)

1655
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,080
- We need 1 more.
 -  We need 1 more to complete.

1656
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
(With one more piece, the outline of final destination is revealed.)

1657
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,750
- There must be another piece.
 -  We need one more.

1658
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,610
They're giving us the last one.

1659
01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:00,120
- Here's the last piece I mentioned.
 -  Okay.

1660
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,530
Here you go.

1661
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,800
It's a hint. Find out what it is.

1662
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,980
- Is that it?
 -  Yes.

1663
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,900
- Here it is. Take a look.
 -  Take a look.

1664
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,950
Shall we start moving? Let's get going for now.

1665
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,490
- Does it work?
 -  Let's start moving first.

1666
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,260
- Do you see something?
 -  It's Yeouido High School.

1667
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,650
- Isn't that Hangang...
 -  It's Hangang Park.

1668
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:21,300
It's under Wonhyo Bridge. There's a road underneath you can take.

1669
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,320
Like C, the hint we got has M on the back.

1670
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,920
It must be a similar hint.

1671
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,500
- I found the final destination.
 -  Where is it?

1672
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,620
- I found it.
 -  Here it is.

1673
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,750
Where?

1674
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,880
- Yeouido High School.
 -  It's Hangang Park.

1675
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,270
It's Yeouido, Hangang.

1676
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,720
This is certain.

1677
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,360
- "Yeouido, Hangang"?
 -  Yes.

1678
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,450
We found it.

1679
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,070
- Is that the destination?
 -  I knew we'd find it.

1680
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,350
Go to Wonhyo Bridge after passing 63 Building.

1681
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,620
- It's that part of Hangang River.
 -  It's close to Wonhyo Bridge.

1682
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,380
- Is that it?
 -  I think so.

1683
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,820
- There's a cruise ship dock.
 -  That's it.

1684
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,550
- There it is.
 -  We should hurry.

1685
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,920
- There's a puddle of water.
 -  Get out of the car first.

1686
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,520
There's a puddle of water.

1687
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,420
- Just go.
 -  Shall we go now?

1688
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,720
- Start running.
 -  To where?

1689
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,160
- It's that way.
 -  Is that it?

1690
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,350
This is the place.

1691
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,850
Is the other team already here?

1692
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,320
They arrived early.

1693
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,800
- They are here.
 -  Hurry up.

1694
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,920
This place is it.

1695
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,980
Where is it?

1696
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,720
(They must find a platform and place the completed map.)

1697
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,620
Where is it? Where?

1698
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,480
Is this it? Wait. What's this?

1699
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,680
It's my first time running on Running Man.

1700
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,750
- It's my first time running.
 -  Is this it?

1701
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:31,220
What's this?

1702
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,530
- We must place the completed map.
 -  Put the map together.

1703
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,130
- Don't we need another piece?
 -  Which one is it?

1704
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,960
- It's like this.
 -  That's at the bottom.

1705
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,450
- Does it go here?
 -  This is right.

1706
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:44,120
(Will Team Blue win by blocking Team White's interruption?)

1707
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,080
Does it go here?

1708
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,450
- We need one more.
 -  This goes at the bottom.

1709
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,050
We have to find one more.

1710
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,480
- We must find it.
 -  We must find one more piece.

1711
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,880
(Wasn't the map complete before?)

1712
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,420
Which one is missing?

1713
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,680
(Where is the missing puzzle piece?)

1714
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,280
(A rectangular map needs another piece when put in a square form.)

1715
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,070
Do we have to find it?

1716
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,980
You don't have one hint,

1717
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,050
so you don't know the secret to the last piece.

1718
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,420
- You'll find R Mons at this place.
 -  R Mon?

1719
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,750
Hold R Mon...

1720
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,120
and put this against it.

1721
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,680
You'll see a clear R on a real R Mon.

1722
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,150
The fake one will say "Fail".

1723
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,380
- Where? Oh, I see it.
 -  It says on here.

1724
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,050
You must find the right R Mon. If you find it quickly,

1725
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,820
- I'll give you the last hint.
 -  Okay.

1726
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,090
I understand.

1727
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,950
Many R Mons are scattered all the way to the playground.

1728
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,280
- Okay.
 -  You must go now.

1729
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,320
Let's go.

1730
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,880
Where are they?

1731
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,650
I'm bad at this kind of game.

1732
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,210
(Among 30 R Mons, 3 of them are real.)

1733
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,320
Here's one.

1734
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,250
(He finds one R Mon.)

1735
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:49,070
(Is this the real one?)

1736
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,080
Kwang Soo. It says "Fail".

1737
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,250
(Fail. Try again.)

1738
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,650
There it is. We found one.

1739
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,750
Let's take a look.

1740
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,750
Is it there?

1741
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,850
(Am I real or not?)

1742
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,600
It says "Fail".

1743
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,750
This isn't real.

1744
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:09,980
(Where are the real R Mons?)

1745
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,580
It says "Fail".

1746
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,350
Here it is.

1747
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,150
(This one says "Fail".)

1748
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,580
(This one says "Fail", too.)

1749
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,720
- Hello, Gary.
 -  Hello.

1750
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,680
Move it out of the way.

1751
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,180
(Catching real R Mon is as difficult as a mobile phone game.)

1752
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,280
(They work hard in vain as R Mons appear and vanish quickly.)

1753
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,420
"Fail".

1754
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,880
We're in trouble.

1755
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,850
That's not the one.

1756
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:47,750
There's one.

1757
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,420
(Everyone runs toward one R Mon.)

1758
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,020
"Fail". Gosh.

1759
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,450
Here's one.

1760
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,920
(Is the one on a seesaw real?)

1761
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,950
Hello.

1762
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,580
Let's see.

1763
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,480
(It's the real one!)

1764
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,520
(I saw it and found it.)

1765
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,580
Seung Won.

1766
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,620
Did you find it?

1767
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,720
The other team got something.

1768
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,550
They must have found one.

1769
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,580
(He tears it off.)

1770
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,920
It says "CMI".

1771
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:25,420
(What does "CMI" mean?)

1772
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,820
What does "CMI" mean?

1773
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,250
(The last secret to the map is hidden in CMI.)

1774
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,010
- Did you find it?
 -  I found it.

1775
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,720
- It says "CMI".
 -  What?

1776
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,110
- "CMI".
 -  It just says "CMI".

1777
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,750
That means music.

1778
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,250
- That's right.
 -  What?

1779
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,720
(CMI seems to mean music.)

1780
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,550
CMI refers to music.

1781
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,750
- What was that?
 -  Is that in order?

1782
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,070
What were the letters we got before?

1783
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,450
Which letters remain?

1784
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,650
- There aren't any.
 -  We found C and M.

1785
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,720
(It's R Mon.)

1786
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,350
This one has to be real.

1787
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,420
(It seems like the real one.)

1788
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,620
This one looks different.

1789
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,980
It's supposed to say R, right?

1790
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,940
- Gary found one.
 -  Where?

1791
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,980
He's over there.

1792
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:08,930
Do I tear it off?

1793
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,950
(He tears off the sticker.)

1794
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,080
"CMI"?

1795
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,280
Is this the hint?

1796
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,480
- Did you find it?
 -  This is the hint.

1797
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,520
It says, "CMI".

1798
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,320
- C?
 -  M and I.

1799
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,390
Cha Seung Won.

1800
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,350
- What?
 -  Does Cha start with a C?

1801
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:29,920
- What's CMI?
 -  It's not Cha Seung Won.

1802
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,750
(Let's go put the map together.)

1803
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,180
Kwang Soo, bring it.

1804
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,390
Bring it, Kwang Soo.

1805
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,580
- Kwang Soo.
 -  What's CMI?

1806
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,520
- Did you get the three letters?
 -  Yes.

1807
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,980
You can find out the secret to the map.

1808
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,410
- What's CMI?
 -  The answer is in those letters.

1809
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,550
What could it be?

1810
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,650
This is where we cooked. This isn't the fish market.

1811
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:54,810
Market?

1812
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:56,910
Market? Cold?

1813
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,180
Isn't it "I'm Cha"?

1814
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,840
- I said it's "I'm Cha Seung Won".
 -  Isn't it "I'm Cha"?

1815
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,750
- Let's go there.
 -  What do we do now?

1816
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,420
We have to do something with CMI.

1817
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,520
Isn't it "I'm Cha"?

1818
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,520
(Cha Seung Won? Music? What on earth is CMI?)

1819
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,420
Isn't it short form of microphone?

1820
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,280
MIC for microphone?

1821
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,950
(Wait, if it's a microphone, isn't it something we're wearing?)

1822
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,720
Find a microphone.

1823
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,620
- A microphone? Where's the map?
 -  It's here.

1824
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,280
Isn't a microphone hiding somewhere on us?

1825
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,390
Microphone.

1826
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,650
- Roger.
 -  Roger, copy that.

1827
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,350
- Roger.
 -  It fits perfectly.

1828
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:42,530
- Microphone.
 -  It's MIC.

1829
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,870
(He talks gibberish.)

1830
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,160
(Does the map appear when I do this?)

1831
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,700
- Roger.
 -  MIC.

1832
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,320
- Isn't it right?
 -  Check this out.

1833
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,520
Wait a minute. MC Yu.

1834
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,250
It's MIC.

1835
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,350
I think it's microphone.

1836
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,850
You are so close.

1837
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,990
I was surprised by how far you got.

1838
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,520
The other team probably found out.

1839
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,080
(They must stop Team Blue from figuring it out.)

1840
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,520
- They haven't figured it out.
 -  No, they didn't.

1841
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,960
CMI, CMI.

1842
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,750
See if there's anything on your microphone.

1843
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,750
Check your microphone.

1844
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,820
(He searches the microphone pocket.)

1845
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,550
(Is it in Seung Won's pocket?)

1846
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:22,020
They're coming in the back. Be careful.

1847
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,750
I don't think it's in there.

1848
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,390
Wait.

1849
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,480
(Wait.)

1850
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,620
(He found the last piece.)

1851
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,220
(The last map piece was in the microphone pocket.)

1852
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,520
Kwang Soo.

1853
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,580
(What's the secret of the map?)

1854
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,020
(You win once you take the flag.)

1855
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:44,750
(They finally figured out the secret of the map.)

1856
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,750
(Where is the flag?)

1857
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,750
- Where's the flag?
 -  Do we look for the flag?

1858
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,050
What's going on?

1859
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,120
(At that moment,)

1860
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,650
(a flag rises from afar.)

1861
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,480
What's going on?

1862
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,850
(He starts to run.)

1863
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,120
What's going on?

1864
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,740
- What is it?
 -  The flag is up.

1865
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,420
- Take it.
 -  Take it now.

1866
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,620
They're after us.

1867
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,420
(Let's catch them first.)

1868
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,170
What's going on?

1869
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,580
Jae Seok.

1870
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,950
(Everyone's goal is to take the flag.)

1871
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,750
- Get it.
 -  It's up.

1872
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,520
(Will they take the flag or lose it?)

1873
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,080
- The flag is up.
 -  Run for it.

1874
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,890
- Hurry.
 -  Pull it out now.

1875
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,720
- Hurry.
 -  Hold it tight.

1876
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,320
- All right.
 -  I got it.

1877
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,180
No, this one.

1878
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,890
(Seung Won gets the flag.)

1879
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,320
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Jae Seok!

1880
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,720
Did you find it in Seung Won's microphone?

1881
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,520
- It was right here.
 -  You mean the missing piece?

1882
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,200
Right. I removed this and it was right here.

1883
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,150
- Wow.
 -  You're amazing.

1884
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,280
You did a great job.

1885
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,230
- Wow!
 -  Good job.

1886
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,520
We made it.

1887
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:00,250
- Goodness.
 -  I'm about to cry now.

1888
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,350
- Seung Won.
 -  Seung Won got the flag.

1889
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:04,000
He's the final winner today.

1890
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,050
What?

1891
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,080
We're a team.

1892
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,650
Seung Won is the final winner.

1893
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,820
(What are you talking about?)

1894
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,720
We let him get the flag.

1895
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,580
- We even held it for him.
 -  We came here first.

1896
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,980
Please look at this.

1897
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,150
- Every microphone had a piece.
 -  Wait.

1898
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,750
- But it is...
 -  Please read this.

1899
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,950
(The one who gets the flag becomes the final winner.)

1900
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,610
My goodness, we're a team.

1901
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,580
- Is he the winner?
 -  Yes.

1902
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,620
- We told you.
 -  Why...

1903
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,180
Why was mine put in weirdly?

1904
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,680
Why did you insert the piece like this?

1905
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,680
Thank goodness you didn't find yours.

1906
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,180
If you did, you would've betrayed us.

1907
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,680
- It's right here.
 -  Right.

1908
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,410
You carried it with you the entire day.

1909
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,620
Really?

1910
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,620
Kwang Soo, you...

1911
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,080
Therefore, Seung Won is the winner of the Golden Compass.

1912
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,520
- My goodness.
 -  This is ridiculous.

1913
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,720
I thought our team was the final winner.

1914
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,620
Guys, take your microphones off.

1915
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,510
Goodness. It was a hint.

1916
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:59,490
Frankly speaking, I'm not that happy.

1917
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,620
I don't really know what's going on.

1918
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,750
- I'm holding it because it's mine.
 -  Seung Won!

1919
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,950
You're very selfless.

1920
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,620
No, I really didn't mean this.

1921
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,420
I was going to get the flag,

1922
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,950
- but changed my mind for you.
 -  He's right.

1923
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,620
I wouldn't have known if not for Kwang Soo.

1924
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:16,620
I think Kwang Soo should get the Golden Compass.

1925
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,420
Give me that Golden Compass.

1926
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,820
This is the Golden Compass.

1927
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,400
- Will you give it to Kwang Soo?
 -  No, I'll take it.

1928
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,350
- It's okay, right?
 -  Yes.

1929
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:27,080
- What is this?
 -  It is...

1930
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,480
This is the Golden Compass.

1931
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,010
- Thank you.
 -  I didn't know about this.

1932
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,110
- Good.
 -  Please give a round...

1933
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,820
of applause to Seung Won!

1934
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,420
You must be very lucky.

1935
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,420
(Congratulations, Seung Won.)

1936
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,580
I'm no longer a criminal!

1937
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,650
What have we done wrong?

1938
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,060
(That's how everything began.)

1939
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,720
Welcome aboard the Train to Prison.

1940
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,150
A trip? Why do I have to be locked up?

1941
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,920
- Why did you do that to me?
 -  Just put me behind bars.

1942
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,980
I have a bad feeling.

1943
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,720
Let's escape when we get to Cheonan.

1944
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,810
(They struggle to escape from the train.)

1945
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,820
I'll hide this inside my cloth and run away.

1946
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,320
- What are you doing?
 -  You can't do this to me.

1947
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:09,270
- Goodness.
 -  Is this the end of the escape?

1948
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,050
(Train to Prison)
