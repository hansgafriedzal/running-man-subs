1
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:09,402
(There's an unexpected guest.)

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,862
(There's someone at the door.)

3
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:17,002
(Someone pulls an awful prank.)

4
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,032
(Why is this happening to them?)

5
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,502
What's going on?

6
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:24,062
(The shadow of vengeance is near.)

7
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:28,132
(The Runjuring)

8
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,532
Please go inside and fill in the questionnaire.

9
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:33,362
Where?

10
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,862
- Do you mean this one? - Yes.

11
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,032
- Do I sit there and fill this in? - Yes.

12
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:41,432
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

13
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:45,562
(Are they answering a questionnaire even before the programme begins?)

14
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,332
"Where would you like to visit?"

15
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:49,532
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

16
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,332
I want a thriller special.

17
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:52,562
(The Second Running Man questionnaire)

18
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:56,732
(Seok Jin writes down his wishes.)

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,962
Every...

20
00:00:58,032 --> 00:00:59,032
(Boom)

21
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,902
(Screaming)

22
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:05,102
(That really scared him.)

23
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,602
My goodness.

24
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:10,202
Gosh, you should've hung it properly.

25
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:11,732
Every...

26
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:13,832
cast member...

27
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:15,832
could be...

28
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,032
the suspect.

29
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:21,602
Just like the movie, "The Neighbour".

30
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,302
(Water drops on his head.)

31
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:24,802
What was that?

32
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:25,962
(Surprised)

33
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:27,902
What happened?

34
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:29,102
(Something just fell on my head.)

35
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:33,102
What was that? Water just fell from the ceiling.

36
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,832
It was water.

37
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:38,302
(What's going on in this room?)

38
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,002
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

39
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,132
Oh, my goodness!

40
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,262
(Oh, my goodness!)

41
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,902
(He's shocked.)

42
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,662
(It's giving him goosebumps.)

43
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:54,402
Why did it fall?

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,132
My goodness!

45
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,202
(Startled)

46
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,332
(He's sniffing.)

47
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:05,062
(What just touched my hand?)

48
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:10,432
(Ji Hyo enters the mysterious waiting room.)

49
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,662
Hi, Ji Hyo.

50
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,962
(She gargles her mouth to feel refreshed.)

51
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:19,102
- What's this? - Please fill out the questionnaire.

52
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:22,802
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

53
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,602
(She screams.)

54
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,632
My gosh.

55
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,532
What was that?

56
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,872
Something feels wrong about this room.

57
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:38,632
(Is this a haunted room?)

58
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:39,832
I'm scared.

59
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,372
(Is this a haunted room?)

60
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,762
I feel like something is going to crawl out from under the sofa.

61
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:57,732
(There's something weird about this room.)

62
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:03,432
(Ji Hyo moves aside and starts filling out the questionnaire.)

63
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:06,362
I'm done.

64
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,662
Please go to the next room.

65
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,202
You can go.

66
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,302
It's just a door.

67
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,432
(Why does everything feel so eerie today?)

68
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,302
(The members who've gone through this are waiting in the next room.)

69
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:30,832
(They've all become quiet after the incident.)

70
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,732
If I scream when the door opens, would Ji Hyo be startled?

71
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,202
If you scare her,

72
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,902
would she slap you in the face or not?

73
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,332
- I'll bet my entire fortune. - Really?

74
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:44,102
- She'll definitely hit me. - Do you think so?

75
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:45,932
She'll swear at him while hitting him.

76
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,932
I'll bet on that, too.

77
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,132
- She'll hit the back of his head... - Give it a try.

78
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:51,432
or slap him in the face.

79
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,362
- Grab her shoulders and scream. - Right.

80
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,532
(Kwang Soo is nervous.)

81
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:59,332
- Hi, Ji Hyo. - Something fell off, right?

82
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,962
- Yes. What was it? - What fell off?

83
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:09,302
(She screams and swears at him.)

84
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,032
(I'm sorry.)

85
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:14,672
- You were right. - Look at her facial expression.

86
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:18,002
- I was right. I kept my fortune. - You were right.

87
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,002
- I'll protect my own fortune. - Good job.

88
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,032
Come and sit down.

89
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,262
- You were right. - That's right.

90
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,702
- I knew it. - Your prediction was right.

91
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:27,102
What's with that room anyway?

92
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:29,102
- I don't know. - I don't know, either.

93
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,462
I've been waiting here without knowing what's going on.

94
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:31,732
(What is going on in that room?)

95
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,932
What was that? What are we going to do today?

96
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,832
(All the cast members enter through the mysterious room.)

97
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,762
- Hello, everyone. - Hi, Gary.

98
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,232
- What was that? - I think something is in there.

99
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,332
What's going on?

100
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,902
(I have a bad feeling.)

101
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,502
Everyone, before I tell you...

102
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:51,832
about today's race, I'll introduce you to a special guest.

103
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,032
- Okay. - I see.

104
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:56,562
Please come out. In 1, 2, 3!

105
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,832
- What's going on? - What's happening?

106
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:01,632
(Everyone is startled.)

107
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,632
- What's going on? - What's happening?

108
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,172
(Oh...)

109
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,462
(my...)

110
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,632
(gosh.)

111
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,432
(They fall backwards.)

112
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:15,032
(They take a deep bow backwards.)

113
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,502
- My goodness. - What just happened?

114
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,232
(Why do they have to greet the guest like this?)

115
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,432
- Welcome! - Who is that?

116
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:25,362
(He looks familiar. Who is he?)

117
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,032
- It's nice to meet you all. - Isn't that Gyeong Gyu?

118
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:30,102
(Lee Gyeong Gyu, the king of variety show with a 36-year experience)

119
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,532
- I lost again. - Look!

120
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:36,232
(Gyeong Gyu challenged the cast members three months ago.)

121
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,632
(His challenge ended in a disastrous and humiliating defeat.)

122
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,462
He tried to protect his name tag, but he lost it.

123
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,632
I'll abandon all of my team members and challenge you again...

124
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:44,962
by myself.

125
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,162
(He's back for revenge.)

126
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:48,562
My goodness!

127
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:53,532
(The Runjuring was only a taste of Gyeong Gyu's revenge.)

128
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:54,832
You're joking, right?

129
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,462
(Everyone, look forward to my revenge.)

130
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:59,562
- Was it a hidden camera prank? - Hello.

131
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,102
- Hello, Gyeong Gyu. - Welcome, everyone.

132
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,362
I can't believe this.

133
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,662
(No wonder I had a bad feeling.)

134
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,602
(I never knew Gyeong Gyu would come back.)

135
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,532
(That means...)

136
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,932
- We'll go home early today! - Oh, yes!

137
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,532
(We'll go home early today thanks to Gyeong Gyu.)

138
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:17,662
I knew you would come back. I knew it.

139
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:20,532
- I'm here to celebrate Chuseok. - It's the Chuseok Special.

140
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:22,132
- It's the Chuseok Special. - That's right.

141
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,932
I'm here to redeem my defeat.

142
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,932
- You're rechallenging us? - That's right.

143
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,432
- Did you form a team again? - Again?

144
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,132
- Yes, I formed a new team. - I see.

145
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:31,202
- I formed a new team. - His last team was very strong.

146
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,232
- We caught even Kim Dong Hyun. - Exactly.

147
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:36,302
- My new team is very strong. - Is that so?

148
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,202
- I removed all the weak members. - Yes.

149
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:42,762
- You found faster people? - I found new members.

150
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,562
- I'm excited to meet them. - Right.

151
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:47,732
Today's theme is Running Man versus Avengers Part Two.

152
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:48,932
It's the second part.

153
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:50,032
(Running Man vs Avengers Part 2)

154
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:53,832
You'll have a match with Team Avengers who became stronger.

155
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,532
The winning team will be decided...

156
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,162
through Name Tag Elimination at the end.

157
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,732
- Name Tag Elimination? - Like last time.

158
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:04,102
Each team gets to choose the lucky and unlucky members...

159
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,532
who will be given special missions.

160
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:09,232
Before the final match, the team that wins the first round...

161
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,362
will be given a hint about the other team's lucky and unlucky members.

162
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,762
So it's very important to win the first round.

163
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,402
The winning team will receive the golden shield.

164
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:19,932
The leader of the losing team and the member the leader chooses...

165
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:22,262
will be hit on the forehead by the other team.

166
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,802
- That's the penalty. - Gyeong Gyu, will that be okay?

167
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,462
- Can we hit Gyeong Gyu, as well? - Do you expect us to hit him?

168
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,232
- Yes, you can. - I can't even imagine...

169
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,632
hitting Gyeong Gyu on his forehead.

170
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,532
- I'll try my best to win. - I can't hit him.

171
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:37,362
(You don't have to worry about that.)

172
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:41,502
(I brought the strongest team for my revenge.)

173
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,832
I'm nervous to meet his team.

174
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,432
His team was great last time.

175
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,702
- That's right. - They were very strong.

176
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,932
- They were strong, indeed. - But we won.

177
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,162
(Last time was like an appetiser.)

178
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:58,002
(This time will be like a full course meal.)

179
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,032
- All right! - What's that?

180
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,432
(The members of Team Avengers will be revealed.)

181
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:04,732
- What's that? - Who is that?

182
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,762
- Hi, Hye Jin. - My goodness.

183
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,502
- It's Hye Jin. - It's been a long time.

184
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:12,502
(Han Hye Jin, Team Avengers)

185
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,062
- Welcome. - Hello.

186
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,232
Congratulations on the birth of your baby.

187
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,002
- Thank you. - How have you been?

188
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:22,432
- How have you been? - It's been a really long time.

189
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,632
It's good to see Hye Jin again.

190
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,432
- Since the last time she was here, - Hello.

191
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,032
- "Healing Camp". - Hye Jin...

192
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:30,532
got married and everything. You two hosted "Healing Camp".

193
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:31,832
- That's right. - We hosted the show together.

194
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:34,032
- They hosted it with Kim Je Dong. - That's why it's "Killing Camp".

195
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,862
- It reads, "Killing Camp". - That's right.

196
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,462
The first round is "Killing Camp".

197
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,332
"Don't Say the First Place".

198
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:43,632
The team that guesses more answers...

199
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,002
that are ranked from the 2nd to the 6th in the poll wins.

200
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,632
As soon as the quiz ends, we'll begin "Running Rumble".

201
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,732
The team who wins the first three points can...

202
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,632
eliminate a member from the other team from "Running Rumble".

203
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:58,932
(The first team to win three points can remove the other team's member.)

204
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:01,662
(We'll have a chance of winning if we eliminate the ace.)

205
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:02,832
- I can't believe this. - Right after the quiz?

206
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:03,932
They get to eliminate one of us.

207
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:07,202
The team will have one less member in "Running Rumble".

208
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:08,802
What are these boxes?

209
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,802
- I think people are in there. - What are the boxes?

210
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:13,532
- They need more members. - Only one member of...

211
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,562
- Team Avengers has been revealed. - That's right.

212
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:18,332
The rest of the members are hidden in those boxes.

213
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,772
- Is that so? - They're moving in the boxes.

214
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,432
You can't lock people in boxes like this.

215
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,032
Why do you keep moving in there?

216
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,332
- I wonder who are in there. - The fifth box moved a lot.

217
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,362
The more the box is moving,

218
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:31,602
the stronger the person inside of the box is.

219
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,602
- The 3rd box is moving a lot. - I wonder who's in the 5th box.

220
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:35,832
The 3rd and 5th box.

221
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:38,362
Each time you get the right answer,

222
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:41,532
you can open 1 cell in 1 of the boxes.

223
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,732
- I understand. - You can guess who is in the boxes.

224
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:45,202
- That sounds fun. - I see.

225
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,232
That way, you can eliminate one of the members.

226
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,602
When Gyeong Gyu and Hye Jin get the right answer...

227
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,062
Do you see the roulette?

228
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,362
- They get to... - They choose a member with it?

229
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:56,232
put the name tag of the member they want to remove on the roulette.

230
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:57,732
They can choose the member they wish to eliminate...

231
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,732
- I see more Seok Jin and me. - by spinning the roulette.

232
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,302
It seems like it has more of my name tags on there.

233
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,162
They'll put a lot of Jong Kook's name tags on there.

234
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,532
- You lose if you say the top rank. - Okay.

235
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:07,902
- Let's begin. - Okay.

236
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,272
- Please show us the question. - We shouldn't say the first place.

237
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:11,772
- "The most common baby nickname". - "The most common baby nickname".

238
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,062
Hold on.

239
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,632
This poll was conducted in 2015.

240
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,532
- Did your baby have a nickname? - She knows the answer.

241
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:20,932
- Lucky. - That must be the first place.

242
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,272
- It might be the first place. - I hope it's not.

243
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,562
- I hope it's not. - Did you say "Lucky"?

244
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:24,862
- I hope it's the first place. - It's not on the list?

245
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,102
- It's not in the top six? - It's not on the list?

246
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,772
- Is it not on the list? - It's not on the list.

247
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:30,102
Sparky.

248
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,232
- Who would use that nickname? - I don't think it's on the list.

249
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,332
Sparky.

250
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,202
- Lovely must be the first place. - Jae Seok.

251
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,332
- Lovely. - That must be the first place.

252
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,232
- I'm sure it's the first place. - Is it the first place?

253
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:40,432
- What's the ranking? - Is it the first place?

254
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,632
(It sounds very friendly. It feels like the first place.)

255
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,932
- Lovely. - Lovely.

256
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:47,232
- It's not in the top 2? - It was ranked the 2nd in 2016.

257
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,462
- Really? Goodness. - This one was conducted in 2015.

258
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,732
- I think this name is on the list. - Go ahead.

259
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:53,202
- Joy. - Joy.

260
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,002
- Joy. - It must be on the list.

261
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,202
- Did he get it right? - What ranking is it?

262
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,432
- It's not the first place, right? - Isn't it the first place?

263
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,102
(What ranking could "Joy" be?)

264
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,462
- It's the first place. - Oh, yes! I told you so.

265
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,032
- It's the first place. - Oh, yes! I told you so.

266
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,302
(One team is happy while the other is sad.)

267
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:07,632
- I can't believe him. - I knew it.

268
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,662
(He said the answer that he had to avoid.)

269
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,802
- How did you get that? - Gosh.

270
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,502
- I'm sorry. - See? I told you.

271
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,402
- I was about to call out Awesome. - I told you, Hye Jin.

272
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:20,332
- I told you. It's 2 versus 1. - I'm really sorry.

273
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,302
- I really didn't know. - I didn't pick Joy for a reason.

274
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:23,632
- It was so obvious. - Was it?

275
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,062
- I didn't have a baby nickname. - Didn't you?

276
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,662
- Did you have one, Hye Jin? - I had one.

277
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:28,762
- What was it? - What was it?

278
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,332
- It's quite embarrassing, though. - Please tell us.

279
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:31,532
It was Boxing.

280
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,162
- Boxing? - Really?

281
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:36,502
- I got pregnant on the Boxing Day. - Oh, the Boxing Day?

282
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,062
- On the Boxing Day? - I see.

283
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,902
- That's why you named her Boxing. - What's the Boxing Day?

284
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,232
- The day following Christmas Day. - I see.

285
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:44,002
- That Boxing Day? - Yes.

286
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:46,502
- I see. - I've never heard of such name.

287
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,402
(This is embarrassing.)

288
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,402
Seok Jin. Did you have a baby nickname?

289
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:51,632
I don't think I had one.

290
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:53,132
- Really? Seok Jin? - No baby name for you? Really?

291
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,402
- How about Joseon? - Joseon?

292
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,702
- How about Liberation? - Liberation? No way.

293
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,832
How about Dumbell for Jong Kook's future baby?

294
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,462
- Dumbbell? - Dumbbell sounds good.

295
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,262
For twins, how about Dumbbell and Barbell?

296
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,702
- It sounds great. - Barbell.

297
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:06,132
- We should remove a name. - Let's put Jong Kook's name on.

298
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,762
Where should we put it on?

299
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:10,032
Right here. Let's put this over Seok Jin's name.

300
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:12,802
(We are taking Seok Jin out.)

301
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,402
Why was his name placed right next to mine?

302
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,262
Hye Jin thinks Ji Hyo is a tougher opponent than Seok Jin.

303
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,732
Hye Jin seems quite tough. She even named her daughter Boxing.

304
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,002
She is really cautious.

305
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:24,262
- Let's move on to the next topic. - All right.

306
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,202
- Let's see. - We must avoid the top answer.

307
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,532
"What are the most popular kind of SNS profile pictures?"

308
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:32,062
- We must know better than them. - What is it? SNS profile pictures?

309
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:36,162
- Scenery pictures. - Yes. They are really popular.

310
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:37,802
- Scenery. - Photos of sky, for example.

311
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:39,202
- Scenery pictures... - Yes.

312
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:40,632
- are second most popular. - Yes.

313
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,102
- That was close. - Good one.

314
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:44,532
Don't pick the usual ones.

315
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,662
- It was really close. - So please don't.

316
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:47,662
Scenery pictures are the second popular profile pictures.

317
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:48,932
Since you got the right answer,

318
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,202
(Haha can remove a sticker.)

319
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:53,532
- please choose a sticker to remove. - I'll choose box five.

320
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:55,302
Sticker number three.

321
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:56,962
- I'll choose 3 of box 5. - You chose 3 of box 5.

322
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:58,402
- What is it? - Why?

323
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,202
- I can see feet. - That person must be a man.

324
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,632
- What is that? - He must be sitting.

325
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:02,962
- I can't see any. - He must be lying down.

326
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,402
- He's lying down. - You can only see his feet.

327
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,562
- Look at his feet. They are big. - You can see big feet?

328
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,432
He must be really uncomfortable to stay in the box like that.

329
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,362
Let's remove sticker six next time.

330
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:12,432
That posture looks so uncomfortable.

331
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:13,562
Don't guess the first place.

332
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:14,732
Baby photos.

333
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,762
- That must be the most popular. - Baby photos.

334
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,832
- It must be. - No way.

335
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:18,962
I think selfies are the top of the list.

336
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,432
- Yes, selfies could be the top. - First place.

337
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,102
- Yes. - It's okay if it's not the first.

338
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:23,262
- It can't be the first. - Let's see.

339
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,832
It's fourth on the list.

340
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:27,002
- Good job. - Nice.

341
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,532
- Pictures of family members. - I see.

342
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,532
Let's pick 5 of box 5.

343
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,802
- Sticker 5 of box 5? - It won't reveal his face.

344
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:35,102
Do you want to see the face?

345
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,102
I can almost see though.

346
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,202
- That shirt is out of style. - I have no idea.

347
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,262
Hey. Hide your hands.

348
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,432
I can tell makeup is very lovely.

349
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:43,032
- That person must be a woman. - A woman?

350
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,532
- No way. It's a man. - Hide your hands.

351
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,432
- No, I think it's a woman. - I can see makeup on the hands.

352
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:47,532
That must be a man.

353
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,362
- How about pictures of coffee? - Pictures of coffee?

354
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,862
- No way. - Pictures of Justin Bieber.

355
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,502
- They pressed first. - Pictures of Justin Beiber.

356
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,902
- Selfies. - Selifies, selfies.

357
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,662
- Haha. - Do you mean selfies?

358
00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:01,402
(Wait, selfies are really popular profile pictures.)

359
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,662
- Wait... - It must be the first place.

360
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:04,402
- What are you doing? - It's the first.

361
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:07,002
- No, I didn't mean selfies. - It's the first?

362
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:08,602
- I meant pictures of me, Haha. - It ranks third.

363
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,502
(It ranks third.)

364
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,862
- Gosh, Haha. - Oh dear, I'm so relieved.

365
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:17,202
- Selfies? Really? Only the third? - That's right.

366
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,232
- No way. - I thought selfies are the first.

367
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,602
- Selfies are not the 1st? - What's ranked 1st then?

368
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:22,262
Let's try the third box. Shall we?

369
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,502
Okay. Sticker 6 of box 3, please.

370
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:24,802
- Sticker 6 of box 3? - Yes. That's it.

371
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,402
- Let's see the face. - We're removing sticker six.

372
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,902
But they're not all lying down, right?

373
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,732
I can see the hips.

374
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,762
- That must be a man. - I think all of them are men.

375
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,202
His thighs are something.

376
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,132
- One of them must be Sung Hoon. - The thighs look really thick.

377
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,202
(Thick thighs)

378
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:41,032
(Hang on, I've seen those thighs.)

379
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,202
I can't see properly.

380
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:44,762
- Is he tall? - All right.

381
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,062
Photos of delicious food.

382
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,862
- Food? - Yes. Food.

383
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:48,902
- Food? - Yes.

384
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,432
- It must be on the list. - Yes, it must be.

385
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:51,632
- It might be the first. - Is it on the list?

386
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:53,102
- I think it's the 5th. - It's ranked 6th.

387
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:54,262
- Yes. - Okay.

388
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:58,132
- Good job. - Seok Jin. Let's try 5 of box 3.

389
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,462
- Sticker 5 of box 3? Okay. - Sticker 5 of box 3?

390
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,432
Okay. We'll remove the 5th sticker on the 3rd box.

391
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,332
- Who is that? - He's hiding himself.

392
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:09,132
- It's Moon Hee Jun. - Yes, it's Hee Jun.

393
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:12,832
(Peekaboo! How did you guys figure out?)

394
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,102
You shouldn't do that.

395
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:17,102
(Team Avengers, Moon Hee Jun)

396
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,002
What a surprise.

397
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,932
- Hello, Hee Jun. - It's Hee Jun.

398
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:24,702
He should be in the team.

399
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:26,202
- Is he strong? - Aim for the fifth.

400
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:29,402
(There're only 2 left now. The 1st and 5th.)

401
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,602
Default pictures.

402
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,302
Default profile pictures given by the system.

403
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,602
Default profile pictures?

404
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:35,232
- Yes. - It's on the list.

405
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,362
- Yes. - That's good.

406
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,162
- That must be the first place. - The basic profile picture.

407
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,132
- It must be the 1st place. - It is ranked the 1st.

408
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,002
(Kwang Soo picks the first of all things.)

409
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,332
I told you, right?

410
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:45,762
We don't have to do anything to win.

411
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:48,832
- Come on. - I knew it was the first.

412
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:51,132
- Kwang Soo is really unlucky. - You're right.

413
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:52,432
We don't have to do anything to win.

414
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,402
- I told you, right? - It was so obvious.

415
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:55,802
We'll win without doing anything.

416
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,802
- Gosh. - I knew this.

417
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,532
- I see. - Yes.

418
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:01,332
- We don't need him there. - Him?

419
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:03,202
Are you removing Seok Jin's name again?

420
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:04,302
It's me?

421
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:05,602
Is it Seok Jin again?

422
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,502
- They're determined. - Gosh.

423
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,532
There's only one left for Seok Jin's name.

424
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,662
We must eliminate Jong Kook from "Running Rumble".

425
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,032
- He has profile pictures of us. - Profile pictures of all members?

426
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,162
It's embarrassing.

427
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:19,432
Gyeong Gyu is really showing off.

428
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,702
- Really? - Is that your profile picture?

429
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:22,962
Look.

430
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,732
It's like a music album cover. There's even a title.

431
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:28,062
My father's profile picture is very similar to his.

432
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,302
- How did you even get this? - I know.

433
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,262
Where's my privacy?

434
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,162
- Come on. - You uploaded it to show everyone.

435
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,402
Wait. Do they have to lie down like that all day?

436
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,602
They must be keep tossing and turning.

437
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:43,032
- It must be really hot inside. - My goodness.

438
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,462
Let's see who's next. Wow, this is great.

439
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:46,802
Who's that?

440
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:49,062
"My precious Si On and Sung Yeung".

441
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,332
That was ranked the fourth.

442
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:52,932
- That's the kind. - Yes. Family photos.

443
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,132
- Si On is Boxing, right? - Yes, she is.

444
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,002
- Let's see who's next. - Who is it?

445
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,702
- Is this the number one? - That's right.

446
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:03,002
Yes. The most popular one. Default picture.

447
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,732
I'm not interested in those kinds of profile photos.

448
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,902
- That's not cool. - Gary.

449
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:09,002
Don't you think your profile picture is too handsome for you?

450
00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:12,562
- Did you do that on purpose? - That's way too handsome.

451
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,602
I think he went to the salon for that picture.

452
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,932
Look. It's really neat. He definitely had a haircut.

453
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,832
- Jae Seok, can we speed up? - Sure.

454
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,562
- They are suffering inside. - I see.

455
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,862
- Look, they can't breathe. - I'm sorry.

456
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,332
This is the profile picture of Kwang Soo.

457
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,702
- He's definitely showing off here. - Yes, I can tell.

458
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,062
- No, it's not that. - So, global prince?

459
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,332
No. Not at all.

460
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:35,102
- He wants to be popular worldwide. - I see.

461
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,802
- Let's look at Haha's. - Look at that.

462
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:40,432
Haha always shows his dream to everyone around him.

463
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,502
(Haha wants to be tall.)

464
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,102
- The impossible dream. - What is that?

465
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,102
This picture says Haha wants to be tall like this guy.

466
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,472
- A basketball player. - "Of course. I'm a genius."

467
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,502
- It's like a real bluff. - My goodness.

468
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,662
This is Seok Jin's.

469
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,632
That's a typical 50s' profile.

470
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:58,262
- Really. I mean it. - I agree.

471
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,732
- Really. - That even embarrasses me.

472
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:03,062
Men of his age always put pictures of them look young and active.

473
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:04,902
- That's so typical. - "I am still active!"

474
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,232
- That's right. - "I can do it."

475
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:08,302
- He wants to show people that... - Gyeong Gyu's picture is similar.

476
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,332
he's still healthy and active.

477
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,202
Why did you put a picture of AOA members?

478
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:14,432
- Look at their faces. - It's the picture with our faces.

479
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,102
- Yes. It's with our faces. - I see.

480
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:18,602
I thought it was a farewell message to your agency.

481
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:21,832
(Seok Jin cancelled his contract with his agency after seven months.)

482
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,602
It looks like a farewell message now.

483
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:26,562
(Did you see my profile picture? How are you doing my friends?)

484
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:29,332
"Things you never want to hear from your boss".

485
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,502
- Can I begin? - Yes.

486
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,562
"Get it done before you take off today."

487
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,402
Is it on the list? It must be the sixth on the list.

488
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,662
- It was ranked the sixth. - I see.

489
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,562
- Shall we open up the 5th box? - Let's go with 6 of box 5.

490
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:41,632
- Okay. - All right.

491
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,972
Who is that?

492
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:44,702
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

493
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:48,472
(With flowery shirt and makeup, who could it be?)

494
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,532
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

495
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,562
- It's you, Key. - It's Key?

496
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,602
(Team Avengers, Key)

497
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:58,702
With his face revealed, he looks really stylish with that shirt.

498
00:18:58,732 --> 00:18:59,732
Yes, he really does.

499
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:03,232
My face is all swollen. I was afraid you wouldn't recognise me.

500
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,762
Everything suits for a handsome guy, right?

501
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,472
(His flowery shirt suits him really well.)

502
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:11,202
- "Do it again." - "Do it again?"

503
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:12,802
That sounds annoying, but do people really say...

504
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,732
- Really? - Is it on the list?

505
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:16,502
- In our daily lives. - Let's go with the second box.

506
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,662
- Box 2. - Box 2, sticker 6.

507
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,262
- Box 2, cell 6. - Box 2, cell 6 please.

508
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,502
Would this person be lying down as well?

509
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:22,862
- I don't think so. - Let's find out.

510
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,032
- This one is standing. - I know.

511
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,132
It's pink.

512
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:26,972
- The socks are in pink colour. - Then is it a woman?

513
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,032
Is it a man or woman?

514
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:29,332
- I don't have any idea. - This one is fashionable.

515
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,162
- I think that person is a man. - It must be. We have Hye Jin here.

516
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,902
"This is why you always fail."

517
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,562
- That's why. - It sounds really horrible.

518
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,032
- It's on the list? Really? - Isn't this...

519
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,032
- Take the sticker 1 off. - Box 2, sticker 1 please.

520
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:42,432
- Who is that? - Isn't it...

521
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,932
Gosh.

522
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,432
- Who is he? - Isn't he Roy Kim?

523
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:47,602
- I'm so lost now. - Isn't he...

524
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,932
- an actor? - Is he tall?

525
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,002
- Isn't he Roy Kim? - I saw him, but I have no idea.

526
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:53,532
- My goodness. - Isn't he Shin Sung Rok?

527
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:56,002
- Isn't he the actor Shin Sung Rok? - No way.

528
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,532
"I wasn't like that when I was your age."

529
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,502
Okay.

530
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,302
- Good. - Gosh. That sounds awful, too.

531
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,472
Please open up box 2, sticker 2.

532
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,602
Isn't he on our team?

533
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,902
I really don't have any idea.

534
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:10,702
Who is he?

535
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,862
- Wait. Isn't he Sung Hoon? - Really?

536
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:15,032
You can't change your posture. Are you okay with that?

537
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,532
Let's keep the stickers 3 and 4 untouched until the end.

538
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,002
- Yes. - Let him stand like that.

539
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,762
- We won't free you until the end. - No way.

540
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,502
(Please remove the stickers.)

541
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:29,532
"I need to talk to your parents."

542
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,762
- What? - What are you talking about?

543
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,562
- No way. - It's not about school kids.

544
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,702
Nobody will bring in their parents to their workplaces.

545
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,262
"Why are you so ugly?"

546
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:38,932
Hateful comments on looks?

547
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:39,932
(Wrong answer)

548
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:41,802
"Actually, I like you."

549
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,332
("Actually, I like you.")

550
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,432
No?

551
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,262
"I just don't like you."

552
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,762
("I just don't like you.")

553
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,032
That was really straightforward.

554
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,002
- How about "Go away"? - Gyeong Gyu says it every day.

555
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,232
(All of their answers are wrong.)

556
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:56,802
"Just do as I say."

557
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,262
"Do as I order."

558
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,032
- That sounds like an answer. - That must be the first place.

559
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,602
- That must be the 1st place. - Or the 2nd place.

560
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:07,562
(It must be ranked either the 1st or the 2nd place.)

561
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:09,472
That must be the first place.

562
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,062
- First place. - First place.

563
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,502
(He guessed the first place again.)

564
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:15,302
This makes me feel annoyed.

565
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,762
- It's so annoying. - Gosh, Kwang Soo.

566
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,032
He got the first place right.

567
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,932
I can't believe it.

568
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,362
How did you pull it off?

569
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,262
Your name is gone now, Seok Jin.

570
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,402
Am I gone?

571
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,802
Seok Jin must participate in the competition.

572
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:32,262
- I have to compete no matter what. - You do.

573
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,302
- I'm so curious. - Choose number four.

574
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,262
- Number four, please come out. - He looks like someone.

575
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,472
Who is number four?

576
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:42,162
(Who is the person kept in the box throughout the show?)

577
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,472
(It's Yoon Hyung Bin!)

578
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,902
It's Yoon Hyung Bin.

579
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,702
- It's Hyung Bin. - Hello.

580
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,462
- He does mixed martial arts. - You're right.

581
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,762
- Martial arts. - He'll be great.

582
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,362
(Team Avengers, Yoon Hyung Bin)

583
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:57,702
(He's a professional mixed martial artist in entertainment field.)

584
00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:59,862
I waited for a long time.

585
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:01,502
Look how big his thighs are.

586
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:04,002
- He's never lost a game. - That's right.

587
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:06,202
- He's never lost. - Can we let out number two?

588
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,402
- It's Sung Hoon. - Sung Hoon?

589
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:11,932
(He finally sees light after being kept inside for an hour.)

590
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,902
- He's pretty big. - He's sweating a lot.

591
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,462
- I'm a fan of your drama. - He has a great body.

592
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,632
His acting was good.

593
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:22,332
(Team Avengers, Sung Hoon)

594
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:24,102
Tell me it's not true.

595
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,602
(Sung Hoon is a handsome actor with a hot body.)

596
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,862
- He has a great body. - I'm a fan of your drama.

597
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:31,662
I watched his drama every day, but why didn't I recognise him?

598
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,832
- Number 1. - Who's number 1?

599
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:36,602
- I'm curious about number one. - Who on earth is it?

600
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,062
Who is it? I can't see.

601
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:40,062
(Is that a gorilla?)

602
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,062
- It's Dong Hyun. - It's Dong Hyun.

603
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,402
(Team Avengers, Kim Dong Hyun)

604
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,962
Please give them a round of applause. Thank you.

605
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,362
- Aren't they too strong? - They're too strong.

606
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,002
- It'll be very difficult. - They make a good team.

607
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:55,332
As Team Avengers won, one of Running Man members...

608
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,632
will be taken off the team when their name is chosen.

609
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:00,932
It's okay as long as Jong Kook isn't chosen.

610
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:03,762
Someone else has to be picked other than Jong Kook.

611
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,402
It's a member that will be taken off the team.

612
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:07,962
I hope I'm chosen.

613
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:10,402
It should be either Haha or Ji Hyo.

614
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,832
- Gosh. - I hope it's me or Ji Hyo.

615
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,132
This usually doesn't work in our favour.

616
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:16,332
It's Jong Kook.

617
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,262
- It's Jong Kook. - We're in trouble.

618
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,102
- It's Jong Kook. - Oh, no.

619
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,532
(Kim Jong Kook)

620
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,062
(It's not Jong Kook.)

621
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,962
- What? - It's Ji Hyo.

622
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,162
(It passes Jong Kook and Jae Seok.)

623
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,162
- What? - It's Ji Hyo!

624
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,032
- It's Ji Hyo. - No way.

625
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:39,262
- We're safe. - Thank goodness.

626
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:40,862
(Ji Hyo is excluded from "Running Rumble".)

627
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:43,402
- We still have Jong Kook. - We're safe.

628
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:44,862
Thank goodness.

629
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,432
Jae Seok can't be taken off, either.

630
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,032
(Will Team Running Man be able to take revenge?)

631
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:56,032
(It's a one-to-one competition with one member from each team.)

632
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:59,502
(An additional member joins after every 30 seconds.)

633
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:04,002
(The team to knock out all the opponents wins.)

634
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,232
What if Dong Hyun uses his martial arts technique?

635
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:07,632
- That's possible. - No way.

636
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:09,132
Shouldn't we warm up?

637
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:11,732
- We must win this game. - Let's warm up.

638
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:16,302
(The players ready to run away stretch their legs.)

639
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,832
- Here we go. - You should stay focused.

640
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,862
Me?

641
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:23,162
- I work very hard. - Why are you being careless?

642
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,902
Gyeong Gyu, I'm going to work very hard.

643
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:28,602
Show me something then.

644
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,532
Don't be careless. You must do your best.

645
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,662
- I'll do my best. - You can do it.

646
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:34,362
(In what order will Team Avengers compete?)

647
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:35,762
Here's the countdown.

648
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:37,832
- It's starting. - We can do it.

649
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:40,032
- Jong Kook, please do well. - You can do it.

650
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:42,262
(Everything will depend on who wins the first round.)

651
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,362
- You can do it. - Please.

652
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:48,232
(Who's the first player from each team?)

653
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:55,262
(The first player from Team Running Man is Jong Kook.)

654
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,032
- It's Jong Kook. - Is it Jong Kook?

655
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,862
- He's definitely the first. - Right, it's the same.

656
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,262
They have the same strategy.

657
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:05,802
(First player from Team Avengers)

658
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:07,062
He startled me.

659
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:08,802
(It's UFC fighter, Kim Dong Hyun.)

660
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,332
- Is it Dong Hyun? - Gosh. It is.

661
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,502
- This will be hard. - All right.

662
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:18,202
(Jong Kook vs Dong Hyun)

663
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:21,032
- Is It Dong Hyun? - I knew you'd come.

664
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:23,202
(It's a competition between the strongest member of each team.)

665
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:26,262
I thought it'd be you.

666
00:25:27,062 --> 00:25:28,402
(He trips and falls.)

667
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:32,802
(He trips while trying to look cool.)

668
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,932
(It's a chance for Jong Kook.)

669
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:39,632
(However, he stands up immediately.)

670
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,502
I need to get rid of you quickly.

671
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,802
I need to get rid of you.

672
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,162
(It's a match between best players in their own field.)

673
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:46,932
(Jong Kook grips him hard.)

674
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:49,002
(Jong Kook makes a preemptive strike.)

675
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:52,232
If Dong Hyun loses, we'll be at a disadvantage.

676
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:54,062
It won't be easy to defeat him.

677
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:55,732
Jong Kook grabbed him.

678
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:59,802
(Jong Kook holds down his collar and attacks with his right hand.)

679
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:01,462
(Amazing)

680
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:04,562
Jong Kook got closer to touching Dong Hyun's name tag.

681
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:07,362
(Dong Hyun is at risk.)

682
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,332
- This is so exciting. - What if he gets him?

683
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:10,462
He's hanging in there.

684
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:12,062
(Dong Hyun endures even though Jong Kook has him by the collar.)

685
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:13,232
Don't come near me.

686
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:15,302
(The countdown for the second player to join starts.)

687
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:17,002
What will you do if Hyung Bin joins?

688
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:21,532
(Which player will join Jong Kook and Dong Hyun?)

689
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:23,062
It's not safe.

690
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:24,632
- Who's going in second? - Who's next?

691
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:25,932
There you go.

692
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:32,432
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

693
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:33,762
(The second players join.)

694
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:37,232
Two, one, zero.

695
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:39,762
(Which players will join to determine the winner?)

696
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:45,532
(It's Lee Kwang Soo from Team Running Man...)

697
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:47,762
(versus Yoon Hyung Bin of Team Avengers.)

698
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:50,062
Grab him, grab him.

699
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:51,562
Take off Hyung Bin's name tag.

700
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:53,762
(It's Jong Kook versus Dong Hyun and Kwang Soo versus Hyung Bin.)

701
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,762
Oh, goodness.

702
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,262
(Members who are watching get fired-up.)

703
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:00,662
No, no.

704
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:03,462
Kwang Soo, attack him.

705
00:27:04,602 --> 00:27:06,862
(While two battles are taking place...)

706
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,432
You have long arms.

707
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:09,602
(Jong Kook attacks him.)

708
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:11,062
You have long arms.

709
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:15,232
(Dong Hyun grabs the name tag.)

710
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:17,032
(Tearing)

711
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,232
(He tore Jong Kook's name tag.)

712
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:20,532
You have long arms.

713
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:23,432
(Dong Hyun takes off Jong Kook's name tag in an instant.)

714
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:25,532
- I got it. - Over here, over here.

715
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:26,862
Over here.

716
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,132
(Jong Kook is out.)

717
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,402
Okay!

718
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,332
(Well done, Dong Hyun!)

719
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,602
- He took off the name tag. - He did it.

720
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:35,832
- He did it. - We got this.

721
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,162
- He took off Jong Kook's name tag. - What happened?

722
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,532
It's over for us.

723
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,302
- Goodness. - Kwang Soo, hang in there.

724
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,462
We're in trouble.

725
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,362
(Now, it's Kwang Soo against Dong Hyun and Hyung Bin.)

726
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:48,002
Grab him now. Go to the back.

727
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,502
Grab it from the back. Take his name tag.

728
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,462
(He defends himself with all his might.)

729
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,662
No.

730
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:59,032
(He has to withstand no matter what.)

731
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:03,362
Three, two, one, zero.

732
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:04,562
(Third players join.)

733
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:09,762
(It's Gary versus Sung Hoon.)

734
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:11,062
Hurry up.

735
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:12,862
Hurry up.

736
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:17,262
(Kwang Soo, wait. I'm coming for you.)

737
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,262
(Tearing)

738
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,302
He tore it.

739
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:20,432
(Kwang Soo is out.)

740
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,932
They took off his name tag.

741
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,202
(It's a match of 3 against 1.)

742
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,632
What do I do now?

743
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:28,862
Don't resist, Gary.

744
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:31,102
Kwang Soo, why weren't you quicker?

745
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,962
Don't even resist.

746
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,602
Goodness, what should I do?

747
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:37,632
(Defence is the only way to survive.)

748
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:39,632
(His defence against three players is deft.)

749
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:44,962
Four, three, two, one, zero.

750
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,132
(Fourth players enter.)

751
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:49,232
(It's Jae Seok versus Key.)

752
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,002
- We're in trouble. - Wait.

753
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:55,362
- We're in trouble. - Is your name tag torn off?

754
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:57,932
- It's not off yet. - Stop it.

755
00:28:57,932 --> 00:28:59,962
(All Team Avengers members corner the other team.)

756
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:01,132
We're in trouble.

757
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:03,102
- Stop it. - Wait a minute.

758
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,102
Their defence is incredible.

759
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:06,902
I'm trying to grab him.

760
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,962
You can do it. We're already holding them down.

761
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,432
Just tear it off.

762
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,132
(Jae Seok and Gary attack suddenly.)

763
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:15,262
(But Sung Hoon and Hyung Bin react quickly.)

764
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:17,132
Attack them.

765
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,332
(They're cornered yet again.)

766
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:21,702
- Gosh, what's going on? - You want to play like this?

767
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:22,762
(We can't survive on our own.)

768
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,302
- Is this how you want to play? - New members are joining.

769
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,232
(Seok Jin joins.)

770
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:30,832
- New members are joining. - Gosh, we're in trouble.

771
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,002
(Hee Jun from Team Avengers joins.)

772
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,432
- What's going on? - Gosh.

773
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:35,532
Gosh.

774
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,032
- No. - Watch out.

775
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:38,962
- No. - Seok Jin.

776
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,662
(Seok Jin is out as soon as he joins.)

777
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:43,162
- Goodness. - Seok Jin.

778
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:45,232
Why did you even attack Seok Jin?

779
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:47,232
(Seok Jin is out immediately.)

780
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,132
(Oh, no.)

781
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,402
What on earth was that?

782
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,402
(They burst out laughing.)

783
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,962
Oh, my goodness.

784
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:04,062
(It's 2 Running Man versus 5 Avengers.)

785
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:05,062
(Tearing)

786
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:08,202
(Hyung Bin tears off Gary's name tag.)

787
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:09,662
Wait, what happened?

788
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:13,532
(Sung Hoon eliminates Jae Seok.)

789
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:15,302
(All Team Running Man members in the ring are eliminated.)

790
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:16,332
Wait.

791
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:21,062
(They've been playing "Name Tag Elimination" for six years.)

792
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:24,162
(It's time for my revenge. I can't lose twice.)

793
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:25,232
Come out.

794
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,202
Come here.

795
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:29,932
(Only Haha remains on Team Running Man.)

796
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,402
Is everyone else eliminated?

797
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,402
(Seventh Avenger, Han Hye Jin appears.)

798
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:37,702
- We predicted this would happen. - Don't do it.

799
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,832
(It's time to go, Haha.)

800
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,502
- Turn him over. - Turn him over.

801
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:42,832
- See you later, Haha. - Hold him.

802
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,462
(They deliver Haha to Hye Jin.)

803
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:46,602
(Poor Haha.)

804
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:50,932
(Hye Jin tears off his name tag elegantly.)

805
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,032
(Tearing)

806
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,162
That was humiliating.

807
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:58,262
- That was so embarrassing. - Goodness.

808
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,132
How could they do that?

809
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:03,062
He eliminated Jong Kook.

810
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,902
- I wish we could play once more. - It's so unfair.

811
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:08,562
Team Avengers wins.

812
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:09,702
(Team Avengers is the winner of "Running Rumble".)

813
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:13,402
- It's a complete defeat. - We got completely defeated.

814
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:16,562
- That's too harsh. - Gosh, seriously.

815
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:21,502
We were completely defeated today.

816
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,332
We weren't this bad before.

817
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:26,932
Hyung Bin did much better than I thought.

818
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:30,002
- He was very fast. - How did you think of me, then?

819
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:33,132
- Seriously. - I thought you'd be easy.

820
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,732
Hyung Bin worked out a lot.

821
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,132
He was really fast but also frivolous at the same time.

822
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:40,562
- He was too frivolous! - I know.

823
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:44,132
- They've become too strong. - That's right.

824
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:46,532
How could you eliminate the name tag that fast?

825
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:49,762
I focused too much on the game and kind of lost my mind.

826
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,862
I could see that when I saw your eyes flipping out.

827
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:55,232
- He was seriously half crazy. - Gosh.

828
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:57,462
- Sorry? - Why aren't you getting married?

829
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:00,032
People told me to get married as late as possible.

830
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:02,162
We didn't mean this late.

831
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:03,932
You should've been married already by now.

832
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,662
- Sorry? - Why don't you join "Mum's Diary"?

833
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:09,502
- Me? - Are you casting him?

834
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:11,002
I am a good son.

835
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:13,332
- I'm scanning him now. - He's bad at things like that.

836
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,462
I am very close with my mother.

837
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,732
- He doesn't live alone. - He lives with his parents.

838
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:20,832
Paparazzi gave up on him because he's so boring.

839
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:23,832
He's either always at home or at the gym.

840
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:27,002
You'll hear only three answers if you ask him what he's doing.

841
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:29,032
"I'm on my way to the gym", "I'm working out" and...

842
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,002
"I'm going home from the gym".

843
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:34,132
He'll give you 1 out of these 3 answers.

844
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:35,832
(They had a good time in the bus.)

845
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:37,832
(They arrive at the place for the second round.)

846
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:41,232
The mission in this round is "Sixth Sense Quiz".

847
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:44,232
- The Running Man team goes first. - Is it...

848
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:46,032
(I have a bad feeling.)

849
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,202
- I think it is... - No way.

850
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:54,032
Each member will take charge of each sense.

851
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:56,202
And one member should make a guess...

852
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:59,032
based on the information from the other members.

853
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:01,202
Each team will answer two questions at once.

854
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:04,962
If you end in a tie, the team that took less time to answer will win.

855
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,402
- This is... - No way.

856
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,102
(We've done this before, right?)

857
00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:10,462
(My premonition was never wrong.)

858
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,132
I was hoping we wouldn't do this.

859
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:13,462
(My premonition was never wrong.)

860
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,562
(They've done this scary mission seven months ago.)

861
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:19,032
What is this? It feels so strange!

862
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,462
(It's scarier because they can't see it.)

863
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:21,932
What is this?

864
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,102
(It's scarier because they can't see it.)

865
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,832
Get out, Ji Hyo.

866
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,832
- You can't decide that. - I'll smell.

867
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:34,002
The other members aren't allowed to answer on behalf of anyone.

868
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,032
The team members can only describe what they felt.

869
00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:37,902
- Jong Kook should touch it. - You're right.

870
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:39,232
Jong Kook, you can touch it.

871
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:42,262
- You can't decide that. - Who will smell, then?

872
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:44,032
- I want to smell it. - He's sensitive.

873
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:47,332
Team Running Man, please discuss it over there.

874
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:49,632
- Team Avengers, please sit down. - Why should I do that?

875
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:52,232
- Please sit down and... - Who will see it?

876
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,402
(What items will they be guessing today?)

877
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,932
(Please wait and see.)

878
00:33:57,932 --> 00:33:59,802
I am sure you prepared scarier objects.

879
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:03,632
If the object hurts me, I'm going to kill it.

880
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,602
Please do not kill it.

881
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:08,232
I made it clear now.

882
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:09,872
- Please don't kill it. - My goodness.

883
00:34:10,002 --> 00:34:11,432
I really mean it. I'll kill it.

884
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,902
Here's the first item!

885
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,632
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3!

886
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:20,032
(What is the first item that will stimulate the members' senses?)

887
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,502
- Gosh. - What is it?

888
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,832
- This is unbelievable! - My goodness!

889
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,432
(They're seriously shocked.)

890
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:32,162
This is really something!

891
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:33,732
- Will they really be all right? - That's too much.

892
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,432
(Will they really be all right?)

893
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,302
(Are they acting, or are they really shocked?)

894
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,562
(They're about to lose their minds.)

895
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:42,762
(Ji Hyo has to guess the answer.)

896
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,732
- My goodness. - I can't believe this.

897
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,302
- This is truly shocking. - Kwang Soo.

898
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:48,662
(It's giving them goose bumps.)

899
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:49,872
I'm going to hear this.

900
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:51,872
- I want to smell it. - Gosh, I'm scared.

901
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:55,062
- My goodness. - Look at Dong Hyun. It's real!

902
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:56,902
Gosh, this is so scary.

903
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,532
- Let's do it. - Go for it.

904
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,732
- I don't think I can touch this. - Go on.

905
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,132
They're just trying to scare us.

906
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:04,532
- It won't kill us, will it? - Gosh, this is crazy.

907
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,602
My goodness, just do it already.

908
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,532
Why don't you try it yourself?

909
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:12,162
- This is really scary. - They're so scared.

910
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:14,062
- I'm serious. - Do it! No, don't!

911
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:15,932
(Why are you doing this to me?)

912
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:17,132
Please don't do that!

913
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:21,002
- My goodness. - I've never seen that before.

914
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,732
(What is inside the box?)

915
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,232
- I can't do this. - Gosh.

916
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:26,832
(What is inside the box?)

917
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:29,432
- Is it moving? - It is moving.

918
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:31,232
- This is my first time seeing that. - Gosh.

919
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,732
(Is it a hand?)

920
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,162
- I have to feel it. - Go down.

921
00:35:36,162 --> 00:35:37,602
(They're acting to scare Team Running Man.)

922
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:38,762
What is it?

923
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,502
(He is really scared.)

924
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,372
(Gary's hand is close to the hand in the box.)

925
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:44,872
- No, not there! - It's moving.

926
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:47,002
- I can't do this. - Not there.

927
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:48,872
(Cringing)

928
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:50,502
You look so ugly. Just do it.

929
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,032
Be quiet. That's not important.

930
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:53,932
(Screaming)

931
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,702
(He touched the hand inside the box.)

932
00:35:57,832 --> 00:35:58,872
(Gary finally lost his mind.)

933
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:00,232
Why? What was it?

934
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:02,502
It almost bit you. That was so close!

935
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:04,562
- You almost got bitten. - Goodness.

936
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,832
(He's dizzy.)

937
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:09,132
- It touched me. - What did you touch?

938
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:10,602
- Is it moving? - My gosh.

939
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:12,732
- Is it alive? - It licked me.

940
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:15,932
(I think it licked my hand.)

941
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:20,602
(The hand touched Gary just like a reptile's tongue.)

942
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:25,762
- This is really something. - Are you serious?

943
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,962
- Describe it. - Tell me what you felt.

944
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,462
- What did it feel like? - Tell us.

945
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:30,832
- Tell us. - Come on.

946
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:32,102
I felt its skin.

947
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,462
- What? - It was skin.

948
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:38,602
- My gosh, this is scary. - I'm not sure if it was a tongue...

949
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:39,802
- or skin. - Really?

950
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:41,832
- Gosh! - I don't think I can do this.

951
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,102
Let's switch our positions.

952
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,562
- I'm not exaggerating! - You should do it.

953
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,902
- You know I can't do this. - My goodness!

954
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,662
- Will you not start? - You know I can't do this.

955
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:52,932
- What are you doing? - I can't do this.

956
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:54,602
- Just do it! - I'm too scared now.

957
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:59,402
(It's Kwang Soo's turn to hear it now.)

958
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:00,872
Is this sound really coming from the box?

959
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:03,602
(Kwang Soo, come on.)

960
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,232
He looks like a fool again.

961
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,232
(I can hear you.)

962
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,632
- Kwang Soo, what do you hear? - It was dry.

963
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:09,932
What does it sound like?

964
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:11,902
I'm telling you, it moves.

965
00:37:12,502 --> 00:37:14,332
- Gosh, you're lying. - I am not.

966
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,332
(What did Kwang Soo hear?)

967
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:20,332
(The noise is 100 percent made only by hand.)

968
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:23,102
The thing moves. It moves.

969
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,332
- It moves? - I fought with it.

970
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:27,302
(It sounds like this.)

971
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:28,632
This is how it sounds like.

972
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,432
- Then... - Is it a dinosaur?

973
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,432
Is it a tongue?

974
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:32,932
- Gosh, I can't do this. - I think it's a tongue.

975
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,732
Toads are poisonous.

976
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,232
It's warm.

977
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,602
Right. It's really something.

978
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:39,872
Why is it warm?

979
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,562
- It's really warm inside. - Just do it.

980
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,202
- Why is it warm? - Feel the skin.

981
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:46,332
- My goodness. - Just do it.

982
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,372
I almost hit you with my elbow.

983
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,402
- My goodness. - We have no time to waste.

984
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:52,762
(He's hesitating.)

985
00:37:54,302 --> 00:37:55,872
Do it slowly.

986
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:58,502
(He screams.)

987
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,562
(Jae Seok slightly touches the hand.)

988
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,002
- You! - What's wrong with you?

989
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,002
- It's alive. - I told you! It's moving!

990
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:11,232
- Is it really moving? - Gosh.

991
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,432
I told you that it moves.

992
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,002
Jae Seok just swore.

993
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:17,372
- Is it alive? - It is.

994
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,032
- Really? - It's moving.

995
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:21,602
Why are you doing this to me? No, I don't want to do it.

996
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:23,602
- This is... - Is it really alive?

997
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,532
- It's so scary. - Hold on.

998
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:26,802
(Haha smells it.)

999
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:31,132
Wait. It smells like my grandmother.

1000
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:34,132
- What? - I'm serious.

1001
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:35,232
(It smells like Haha's grandmother.)

1002
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,432
- What does it smell like? - Please tell us.

1003
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:39,632
It smells like a house where five guys live in.

1004
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:42,462
You must touch it to guess the item.

1005
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:45,062
- I am pretty sure. - Still, I have no idea!

1006
00:38:45,302 --> 00:38:47,932
It's like a room where five guys live in.

1007
00:38:48,532 --> 00:38:50,032
- Gosh, what on earth is it? - I'm so curious.

1008
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:52,402
- What is it? - It really smells like guys.

1009
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:53,732
- What colour is it? - It moved really quickly.

1010
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,432
- What is it? - It's soundless.

1011
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:57,262
- It doesn't have any hair. - But it moves very fast.

1012
00:38:57,832 --> 00:38:59,102
It's really hard to guess.

1013
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,232
- If it's quiet... - Do people live inside the box?

1014
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,632
If it is soundless...

1015
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:03,832
(That's not entirely wrong though.)

1016
00:39:04,032 --> 00:39:06,162
- It is a soundless... - Take a look at it.

1017
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:07,832
What colour is it?

1018
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:10,332
It was moving before, but it stopped moving.

1019
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:12,762
- You said it's alive. - It's dead now.

1020
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:14,962
It's sinking down inside the box.

1021
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,762
I don't think it's a living creature.

1022
00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:19,962
- What? - It's not alive. I think...

1023
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,632
it's something made of steel.

1024
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:23,202
- It is... - Made of steel?

1025
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,732
Then...

1026
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,602
It smells like...

1027
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,732
- It's really hot in here. - It is.

1028
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:31,132
Is it because it's breathing?

1029
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:33,562
It's steaming inside.

1030
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:35,032
(He moves his hand around.)

1031
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:38,302
(They almost shake hands.)

1032
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:39,832
Why?

1033
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,132
It's a bit wet.

1034
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:44,662
- Is it wet? - Yes, it's wet.

1035
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,462
- I think... - It's wet.

1036
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:48,662
- Why is it wet? - It's wet.

1037
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:50,502
I've seen it a lot before.

1038
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:52,602
It's really dangerous.

1039
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:55,372
(Seok Jin gets shocked.)

1040
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:58,372
- What was that? - I think it's an abalone.

1041
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,662
- What? - An abalone.

1042
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,132
It was wet, and it felt like skin.

1043
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,132
- Is it slippery? - Mine was dry.

1044
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:08,332
- Mine was dry. - But mine was wet.

1045
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,432
- It moved very fast. - You didn't touch it.

1046
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:11,932
I did touch it.

1047
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:13,662
- You didn't. - I brushed up against it.

1048
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:16,632
- Really? - Ji Hyo, it's like skin.

1049
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:18,402
- Try putting everything together. - Can it be a sponge?

1050
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,102
It made slurping sounds.

1051
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:22,102
You said it was slippery.

1052
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:23,732
It sounded more like this.

1053
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,762
It moved quickly and touched my hand.

1054
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,132
Did it really sound like that?

1055
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:30,932
(Will they be able to guess it correctly?)

1056
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:34,432
Is it a bullfrog?

1057
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,832
(Her guess is a bullfrog.)

1058
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:38,262
You're wrong.

1059
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:40,102
- It's hard. - You were close.

1060
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:43,372
- My goodness! - Isn't that a hand?

1061
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:44,702
(Surprise!)

1062
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,532
- It's a human hand. - There's a hand inside the box.

1063
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:49,832
- Is it a hand? - This is what I touched.

1064
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:51,502
- Gosh. - Is it a hand?

1065
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:53,902
- How did it make such a sound? - Whose smell was it?

1066
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:57,102
- I told you. - You thought it was calamari.

1067
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,762
- Haha. - It stinks.

1068
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:00,402
You were right, then.

1069
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:02,102
- It is... - It smells like factory bread.

1070
00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:04,232
It's Team Avengers' turn now.

1071
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:06,372
They don't seem that scared.

1072
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,232
Let's open the first item right away.

1073
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:10,872
Am I in charge of looking at it?

1074
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,032
You should touch it.

1075
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:16,762
- I'll listen to it. - No way.

1076
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:17,872
In one,

1077
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:19,402
- I can hear very well. - two,

1078
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:21,062
- What? Who? - three.

1079
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,002
(You were so relaxed when you were watching it, right?)

1080
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:27,262
(What will be in the boxes this time?)

1081
00:41:28,732 --> 00:41:30,162
This is so different from ours.

1082
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:32,062
(What could it be?)

1083
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:33,432
This is so different from ours.

1084
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:36,332
- What is that? - Oh, my.

1085
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,202
- They can't see. - This is not a joke.

1086
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:40,872
- This is too much. - This is so different from ours.

1087
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:43,602
So this is what you got for them. Good job.

1088
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:45,132
Well done.

1089
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,932
- You didn't betray us. - This is crazy.

1090
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:50,762
- This is too much. - I'm not kidding.

1091
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:52,232
- We're not lying. - What is it?

1092
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,262
- I'm telling you for real. - This is real.

1093
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,432
- We're not joking. - It really moved.

1094
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:58,632
- This one looks angry. - Look at this. Look.

1095
00:41:58,632 --> 00:41:59,902
I swear that it is alive.

1096
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:01,532
- It really is. - This is surprising.

1097
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,162
- Look at this. - This is insane.

1098
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:04,372
Take a look at this!

1099
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,962
- Look at this one. - It is so active.

1100
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:07,462
Look how active it is now.

1101
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:09,802
(Are they faking it, or is it real?)

1102
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:10,962
- But... - Wait.

1103
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,232
I can hear some loud thumping noise.

1104
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:15,832
(The loud sound is coming out through the headphones already.)

1105
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:18,232
- Put in your hand first. - It's the first time I see it.

1106
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:21,132
- Just put it in. - It's not very dangerous but...

1107
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,462
- No. - It can be dangerous.

1108
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:24,532
To my knowledge, it has teeth for sure.

1109
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:26,762
- I can feel the movement. - It's moving.

1110
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,032
- You're right. - It's really alive.

1111
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:32,762
- I've never touched one alive. - Me neither.

1112
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:34,372
- I mean it. - It's true.

1113
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:37,602
- Try to touch it. - You don't usually touch it alive.

1114
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:40,732
- Even if I knew what it is, I... - I would not be able to touch it.

1115
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:42,232
(Are they telling the truth or not?)

1116
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:45,202
(What is the item that will stimulate their senses?)

1117
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:48,502
Hyung Bin, what's wrong with your hand?

1118
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,332
(Welcome. Please explore me.)

1119
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,502
Hyung Bin, what's wrong with your hand?

1120
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:55,962
Touch it right.

1121
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:58,262
(I can't get my wrist straight.)

1122
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:00,262
- You're almost there. - Almost.

1123
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:02,372
- Is there a plate? - A little further.

1124
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,132
It's already standing so just spread your fingers.

1125
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,732
I've never seen anyone touching it alive.

1126
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:08,832
No way.

1127
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,932
- Does it have feet? - I can only touch it if it's dead.

1128
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:13,032
- Only if it's dead. - Of course.

1129
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:14,102
(He is just 1cm above the abalone.)

1130
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:15,932
I'm scared to see their faces.

1131
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:17,702
Oh, I couldn't...

1132
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:20,962
(Screaming)

1133
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,762
(He wants to fight with the abalone.)

1134
00:43:22,762 --> 00:43:23,832
Hey.

1135
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,602
I hate it.

1136
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,832
- I can't touch it even if I see it. - I felt something mushy.

1137
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:30,702
- Mushy? - There's something mushy.

1138
00:43:30,702 --> 00:43:34,232
It's not too mushy, but it is a little bit.

1139
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:36,032
- Did it bite? - It felt like a monster.

1140
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:37,562
- Is it alive? - I think so.

1141
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:39,402
- Is it wet? - Then what's this sound?

1142
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:40,632
What is this?

1143
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:42,762
I don't know why they put listening to this.

1144
00:43:42,762 --> 00:43:45,162
- I've never heard the sound of it. - I hear a fizzing sound.

1145
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:46,832
Could you mimic the sound?

1146
00:43:47,532 --> 00:43:49,402
It's the sound of chewing something.

1147
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,602
Try to make that sound.

1148
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,462
- I can hear it, too. - Make the sound.

1149
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:54,232
- Sung Hoon. - That's because it has teeth.

1150
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,232
- Mimic the sound. - It sounds like it's munching.

1151
00:43:56,232 --> 00:43:58,632
- Did they feed it? - What on earth is it?

1152
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:04,032
(It's the sound you can hear when you take abalones off.)

1153
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,762
(Respond, my hearing organs.)

1154
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:10,162
There is a fizzing sound...

1155
00:44:10,202 --> 00:44:11,662
and it's chewing on something.

1156
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:12,932
- What is it chewing? - That's right.

1157
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:14,532
- What's the fizzing sound? - It has to eat something.

1158
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:16,762
- It has teeth anyway. - It's slippery...

1159
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,302
and mushy.

1160
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:19,732
- Is it slippery? - Yes.

1161
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:21,662
- It has teeth. - Next, it's Key's turn.

1162
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,462
(Key tries to guess by looking at it.)

1163
00:44:23,462 --> 00:44:24,562
Can you see it?

1164
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,862
It's not moving, but what colour is this?

1165
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:29,032
It is moving now.

1166
00:44:29,102 --> 00:44:30,262
Is it moving?

1167
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,502
Let me see.

1168
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:35,262
- Are you done? - It's light green.

1169
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,762
- Light green? - Great.

1170
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,562
- It must be a reptile. - He's good.

1171
00:44:38,662 --> 00:44:40,432
How did you notice that?

1172
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:42,802
Next, it's Gyeong Gyu.

1173
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,662
- Is it a snake? - In fact,

1174
00:44:44,702 --> 00:44:46,662
- I'm not afraid of anything. - No way.

1175
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:47,702
I mean it. What should I do?

1176
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,602
(You have the most active one.)

1177
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:51,102
You have the most active one.

1178
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,002
(Suddenly, he's flustered.)

1179
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:54,162
It is very energetic.

1180
00:44:54,162 --> 00:44:55,702
It's the only one that is still standing.

1181
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:57,632
- Really. - Yes, it's still standing.

1182
00:44:57,632 --> 00:44:58,802
It's the only one standing.

1183
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:01,132
It is as if an alligator is opening its mouth like this.

1184
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:02,862
- It really is. - Right.

1185
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:05,062
Yours is incredibly active.

1186
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,802
- He looks scared. - It's still standing.

1187
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:09,062
- You should know that. - It is true.

1188
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:11,902
(Decide which hand is more important to you.)

1189
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:15,332
Decide which hand is more important.

1190
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:16,732
(He changes to his left hand.)

1191
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:17,962
Which hand do you use to hold your microphone?

1192
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:20,102
Put in the hand that is less important.

1193
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,402
- He put in the left hand. - Yes.

1194
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:23,932
He must be right-handed.

1195
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,362
- It's moving. - It's not there.

1196
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:28,432
It's not over there but in the centre.

1197
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:30,202
- It's in the centre. - Centre.

1198
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:32,062
Don't pretend you are touching it.

1199
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,432
- He's pretending. - You said you're not afraid.

1200
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,962
This one is really moving a lot.

1201
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:39,732
- He's almost there. - Almost there.

1202
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:41,362
Just a little further.

1203
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:42,662
(Screaming)

1204
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:48,932
(That was such a frightening touch.)

1205
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:50,602
- It's moving. - It keeps moving.

1206
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:52,702
- It touched my hand suddenly. - It moves a lot.

1207
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:54,862
It was going to bite me.

1208
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,532
- He's startled. - He's flustered.

1209
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:58,762
You touched it with just the tip of your finger.

1210
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:00,562
You're easily scared.

1211
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:03,262
- You're timid. - You are a coward.

1212
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:05,502
- He easily gets scared. - Gosh.

1213
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,402
I still respect you.

1214
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:09,502
I felt it just with the tip of the finger.

1215
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:10,602
Is it alive?

1216
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:12,662
He is a respectable senior...

1217
00:46:12,662 --> 00:46:14,162
- It is slightly mushy. - yet he is timid.

1218
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:15,432
Next, let's go, Hee Jun.

1219
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:17,532
Does it smell?

1220
00:46:18,032 --> 00:46:20,632
(Let's try to smell it.)

1221
00:46:20,632 --> 00:46:22,132
- Can you smell it? - Does it smell?

1222
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:23,902
Smelling is important.

1223
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,562
(Who are you?)

1224
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:28,702
- It smells like a new house. - A new house?

1225
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,132
- Yes, a new house. - A new house?

1226
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:31,702
Maybe with four bedrooms?

1227
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:34,262
It smells like the wall of a living room.

1228
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:36,332
He has a keen sense.

1229
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:39,062
There is a P apartment in there.

1230
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,832
I think it's R apartment.

1231
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:44,702
(Why not E apartment?)

1232
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,402
- Stop joking and smell it. - Okay.

1233
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:49,832
- It smells... - I think it doesn't have a head.

1234
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:52,502
like an apartment in Busan.

1235
00:46:53,732 --> 00:46:56,162
It smells slightly fishy,

1236
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:58,132
so it's like an apartment near the beach.

1237
00:46:58,132 --> 00:46:59,302
He is so sharp.

1238
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:01,102
- Next, it's Dong Hyun. - Go ahead.

1239
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:02,732
- He is so brave. - Let's see.

1240
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,132
- Dong Hyun is so manly. - Dong Hyun's is so scary.

1241
00:47:05,602 --> 00:47:08,002
(Let's see if you are a real man.)

1242
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:10,232
- That one is active, too. - It's the most active.

1243
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:11,832
I've never seen it like that.

1244
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:15,702
(He flies like a butterfly and dominates the ring.)

1245
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:17,802
(He's like a stun gun that terrifies the opponents.)

1246
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,902
(He is the professional fighter, Kim Dong Hyun.)

1247
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:23,762
(Dominate the abalone for the honour of a fighter.)

1248
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:26,062
- I don't think he'll get hurt. - Oh, goodness.

1249
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:29,902
(Now, it's time to respond.)

1250
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:32,232
(He's twitching.)

1251
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,162
- He twitched. - It's moving.

1252
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:39,602
(A guy whose nickname is a stun gun seems to be attacked by one.)

1253
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:42,802
(They immerse themselves in acting and make a fuss.)

1254
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,432
It's moving!

1255
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,362
- It's standing. - Please stop.

1256
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,332
- Really? - Please stop it.

1257
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:52,432
(Goodness!)

1258
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:54,802
Some parts are hard,

1259
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:56,332
- but other parts are soft. - Really?

1260
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,602
And is it alive?

1261
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:59,232
I think this one is dead.

1262
00:47:59,232 --> 00:48:00,932
- It's alive. - It is.

1263
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:04,632
(Now, try to guess what is in the box.)

1264
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,362
(What is Hye Jin's conclusion?)

1265
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:08,332
- It is both hard and soft. - It's a turtle.

1266
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:10,062
(The answer of Team Avengers is a turtle.)

1267
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:11,632
- A turtle? - Is it a turtle?

1268
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:13,402
- A turtle? - I don't think it's a turtle.

1269
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:16,502
It doesn't smell like a turtle.

1270
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,502
- The correct answer is abalone. - So it was them.

1271
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:21,002
- They are so active. - Oh, gosh.

1272
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,562
Smelling like an apartment in Busan was correct.

1273
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:25,862
- They are alive. - And they are active.

1274
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,902
(The current score is zero to zero.)

1275
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:29,902
They are really alive.

1276
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:33,102
- I'd like to look at it. - I can do that.

1277
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:34,202
We need two people to touch it.

1278
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,062
- You try to touch it. - I can't even look at it.

1279
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:37,532
That place if for touching and this is for looking.

1280
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:40,862
- I want to look at it. - We'll reveal the third item.

1281
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,702
- I can't do this. - In one,

1282
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,502
- They are arguing. - two,

1283
00:48:44,502 --> 00:48:45,662
- Who is touching it? - three.

1284
00:48:45,662 --> 00:48:47,062
I'm startled.

1285
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:48,532
- You need to taste it. - What?

1286
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:50,002
- Taste it? - Yes.

1287
00:48:50,002 --> 00:48:52,162
(What could it be?)

1288
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:55,032
(The Avengers start to overreact.)

1289
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:57,002
- You should not taste it. - Don't touch that part.

1290
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,962
You mean I should taste it? No way.

1291
00:49:00,932 --> 00:49:02,432
(Do you want to taste a piece of it?)

1292
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,762
Kwang Soo, go ahead.

1293
00:49:04,902 --> 00:49:06,462
- I'm scared. - It smells awful.

1294
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:09,032
It has a strong smell. We should figure it out.

1295
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,402
I think it's a fermented skate ray.

1296
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,732
- It smells like a fermented skate. - Gosh.

1297
00:49:14,062 --> 00:49:16,632
- I think it's a dried fish. - A little more backwards.

1298
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:19,102
- Move backwards. - A little more.

1299
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:22,032
- Be careful over there. - It's scary when you don't see it.

1300
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:23,862
(This looks like a reaction competition.)

1301
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:25,402
- So it's that. - That is...

1302
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,762
You are able to touch it though.

1303
00:49:30,162 --> 00:49:31,662
I didn't touch it yet.

1304
00:49:32,932 --> 00:49:34,102
What do you think it is, Kwang Soo?

1305
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:35,202
(He doesn't dare to touch it yet.)

1306
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:37,262
- What is it, Kwang Soo? - Hold on.

1307
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:38,862
Please explain it to me.

1308
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:41,402
- Go on. - We don't have much time.

1309
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:44,432
We don't have much time.

1310
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:47,232
It's hard. It's hard. It's hard.

1311
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:48,862
- Is it hard? - It's hard. It's hard.

1312
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:51,502
- That means it's dry. - Then it's a dried fish.

1313
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,132
Then Gary, what do you see?

1314
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:54,462
I can't see it very well.

1315
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:57,662
It looks like a tail or something.

1316
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,802
- What? - Excuse me?

1317
00:49:58,802 --> 00:50:00,862
- Does it have a tail? - It looks like a brush.

1318
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:02,502
- A brush? - Yes.

1319
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:04,162
- Next, Haha. - What kind of dried fish is there?

1320
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:06,002
It looks like the tip of a brush.

1321
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,132
- You'll find out if you hear it. - It must be a tail.

1322
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:09,262
Is it a dried fish?

1323
00:50:09,732 --> 00:50:10,962
I can hear it from here.

1324
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:12,802
- It's alive. - Excuse me?

1325
00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:14,462
What sound is it?

1326
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:16,362
(It's a crunching sound.)

1327
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:19,802
(It's crunching sound you make when you tear something.)

1328
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:22,402
What sound is it?

1329
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:25,402
Hey, I have to stick my tongue in here.

1330
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:31,032
(What is this scary sound?)

1331
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:32,532
He really is a musician.

1332
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:36,002
- He is a musician. - You make that sound to your baby.

1333
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:37,232
- I'm serious. - His baby?

1334
00:50:38,232 --> 00:50:39,462
You make that sound when you play with your baby.

1335
00:50:39,462 --> 00:50:41,602
- He's making me scared. - It's Seok Jin's turn now.

1336
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,962
What kind of a game is it to stick your tongue into it?

1337
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:46,002
- Do not put in your tongue fast. - Really?

1338
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,162
Why do you say so?

1339
00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:48,332
(They are enjoying Seok Jin's anxiety.)

1340
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:49,432
It will be okay, right?

1341
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:51,632
Your tone is funny.

1342
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,732
(I'm in charge of tasting. May I kiss you?)

1343
00:50:56,202 --> 00:51:00,032
(What can be the romantic item to arouse Seok Jin's taste buds?)

1344
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:05,702
Try to taste it.

1345
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:08,332
I think it doesn't have teeth.

1346
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:09,702
What's wrong?

1347
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:11,732
What's wrong?

1348
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,102
- What's wrong? - What did it taste like?

1349
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:15,362
Did it touch your tongue?

1350
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:19,262
It felt like a hard piece of wood.

1351
00:51:19,262 --> 00:51:20,862
What about the taste?

1352
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,262
It has no taste.

1353
00:51:22,702 --> 00:51:23,762
It has no taste?

1354
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:26,162
- It has fishy taste, though. - Fishy taste?

1355
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:29,662
Jong Kook, touch it and describe it to us.

1356
00:51:30,002 --> 00:51:31,762
He might hurt his hand if he grips it.

1357
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:34,232
- Be careful. - What is it?

1358
00:51:34,502 --> 00:51:36,632
- Can you tell what it is? - What?

1359
00:51:36,662 --> 00:51:37,662
Can you tell what it is?

1360
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:41,002
- It feels like wood, but... - Right.

1361
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,702
it smells like fish.

1362
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:44,002
And...

1363
00:51:44,462 --> 00:51:46,032
- Is it something dried? - It's something...

1364
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,902
we can touch with ease.

1365
00:51:48,562 --> 00:51:49,702
All right.

1366
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,732
You'll sense the strong smell.

1367
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:53,702
It smells like fish.

1368
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:54,962
- It's that. - It's...

1369
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:58,132
- Did you smell it often in Pohang? - I smelled it often in Pohang.

1370
00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:00,002
- It's not something... - Stop.

1371
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,202
- that's completely dried. - It wasn't that soft.

1372
00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:04,502
It doesn't smell like something that's completely dried.

1373
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:06,762
How does something that's completely dried smell?

1374
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:08,732
I thought it's completely dried.

1375
00:52:09,102 --> 00:52:11,032
I thought it was that and she's...

1376
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:13,002
It smells like the salt water...

1377
00:52:13,032 --> 00:52:15,602
- rather than fish. - Let's decide that as the answer.

1378
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:19,302
(What's Jae Seok's final answer after Ji Hyo's description?)

1379
00:52:19,432 --> 00:52:24,962
(It feels hard like a piece of wood.)

1380
00:52:26,702 --> 00:52:29,002
(It has a tail that looks like a brush.)

1381
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:34,002
(It sounds crunchy as if something is being torn.)

1382
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:37,102
(It has no taste, but smells fishy.)

1383
00:52:37,832 --> 00:52:40,732
(It smells like Pohang and something half dried.)

1384
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:47,232
(Team Running Man gets a hint for the final mission if it's correct.)

1385
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:49,102
Dried pollack.

1386
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,202
(Jae Seok's answer is dried pollack.)

1387
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:52,502
- Isn't it dried herring? - That's right.

1388
00:52:53,432 --> 00:52:55,602
I got confused when you said Pohang.

1389
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:57,302
I thought you'd say dried herring.

1390
00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:59,432
- I almost said dried herring. - You didn't, though.

1391
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:00,862
So this is dried pollack.

1392
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,602
Wow, this is the dried pollack.

1393
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:05,802
(The strange sound Haha heard was...)

1394
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,062
- You make that sound when you play. - I'm being serious.

1395
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:12,032
(that of tearing dried pollack by hand.)

1396
00:53:13,332 --> 00:53:15,462
Here's the second object.

1397
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:18,262
In 1, 2 and 3.

1398
00:53:19,002 --> 00:53:20,432
Key is up next.

1399
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:22,662
- What is that? - What is it?

1400
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:24,802
- What's going on? - Here they go again.

1401
00:53:25,062 --> 00:53:26,102
What is this?

1402
00:53:26,232 --> 00:53:27,402
(Here come the people who are experts on bluffing.)

1403
00:53:27,632 --> 00:53:28,932
- Goodness. - What is it?

1404
00:53:29,132 --> 00:53:30,362
How did you even get this?

1405
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:33,432
- How did you even find this? - Does it even exist today?

1406
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:36,002
I can't believe they came up with this idea.

1407
00:53:37,002 --> 00:53:38,002
This is unbelievable.

1408
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:39,862
- Wow, that's... - I would give up.

1409
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:41,762
Let's start with Key.

1410
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:43,502
What are the chopsticks for?

1411
00:53:44,632 --> 00:53:46,062
(Is it something we can't even touch?)

1412
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,962
- Does he need them for tasting? - To taste it?

1413
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:49,302
How can he taste it?

1414
00:53:49,332 --> 00:53:51,032
- It's impossible to taste it. - This is no joke.

1415
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:54,262
Excuse me, but is it possible to make any sound with it?

1416
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:55,902
How can they taste it?

1417
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:58,262
- It's impossible to taste it. - This is no joke.

1418
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:01,502
(The scary unknown object is pork skin.)

1419
00:54:02,902 --> 00:54:04,932
It's Key's turn.

1420
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:07,862
- Is there a plate? - There's a plate.

1421
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,702
(Startled)

1422
00:54:10,302 --> 00:54:11,432
(Haha exaggerates his reaction.)

1423
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:12,732
He just touched it.

1424
00:54:14,102 --> 00:54:15,202
He just touched it.

1425
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:17,462
- You just touched it. - Did I?

1426
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,262
You just touched it, you fool.

1427
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:22,802
(He taps it slightly.)

1428
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:26,502
(They exaggerate their reaction.)

1429
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:28,762
- What is it? - How does it feel?

1430
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:30,432
It feels like some kind of skin.

1431
00:54:31,462 --> 00:54:33,002
- Is it alive? - It feels like skin?

1432
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:34,162
- Skin? - Is it alive?

1433
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:36,332
(Fooling them is so fun.)

1434
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:40,432
(Hee Jun listens to the sound.)

1435
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,402
Someone is making jeon.

1436
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:44,402
- Someone is making jeon. - Really?

1437
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:48,262
- Gosh, what is it? - What happened?

1438
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,832
- There's a fire. There's a fire. - What's going on?

1439
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:54,262
Things are on fire.

1440
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:56,802
There's a fire.

1441
00:54:56,802 --> 00:54:58,962
- There's a fire. There's a fire. - What's going on?

1442
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:04,362
(It's the sound of pork skin sizzling on the pan.)

1443
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:07,602
At first, it sounded like someone is making jeon.

1444
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,102
(Hee Jun describes the sound sensitively.)

1445
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,002
- Then the sound quietens down. - You're so good at explaining it.

1446
00:55:11,032 --> 00:55:13,832
- Your description is amazing. - I can even hear the sound now.

1447
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,962
- Yes, that's what I heard. - His expression is amazing.

1448
00:55:16,002 --> 00:55:17,302
He's very good at describing it.

1449
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:19,502
Everything got burnt.

1450
00:55:19,532 --> 00:55:21,302
(It's Hye Jin's turn to touch it.)

1451
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:23,662
- Goodness. - Please.

1452
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:25,632
- Don't do that. - I was really surprised.

1453
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:28,162
(Hye Jin doesn't hesitate at all.)

1454
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:30,662
- What is it? - Let's move onto the next person.

1455
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:34,462
(Mothers are amazing as they fear nothing.)

1456
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:36,102
Gosh, she's not scared at all.

1457
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:38,962
(She gropes about.)

1458
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:42,332
- Gosh, don't do that. - Don't do it.

1459
00:55:42,402 --> 00:55:45,762
(She isn't fooled by their reaction.)

1460
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:48,002
- How can she do that? - She's not scared at all.

1461
00:55:48,032 --> 00:55:49,262
Why is she doing that?

1462
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:51,702
- Come on. - That's not fun.

1463
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:53,602
That's not fun.

1464
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:55,062
(They try to distract her.)

1465
00:55:55,062 --> 00:55:56,202
That's not fun.

1466
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:58,202
She's becoming less attractive.

1467
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,302
(His comment doesn't affect her.)

1468
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:02,532
- Isn't she too bold? - That's not attractive at all.

1469
00:56:02,632 --> 00:56:03,902
She should be scared a little.

1470
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,502
- What does it feel like? - It's...

1471
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:08,002
very thin...

1472
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:09,932
and is oily.

1473
00:56:11,232 --> 00:56:13,562
- It must be something slippery. - Aren't you scared?

1474
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:16,562
(It's not a big deal.)

1475
00:56:17,702 --> 00:56:19,262
That's impressive.

1476
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:23,002
Hye Jin is incredible, indeed.

1477
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:25,302
(It's Dong Hyun's turn.)

1478
00:56:26,162 --> 00:56:27,532
Why is she not scared of that?

1479
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:29,602
If it were Ji Hyo, she'd be crying already.

1480
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:32,202
It looks like a thumb.

1481
00:56:32,362 --> 00:56:33,532
That's strange.

1482
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:35,562
- It sounds a bit cruel. - Dong Hyun.

1483
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:37,862
Dong Hyun, you're amazing.

1484
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:38,902
(They're impressed by his sight.)

1485
00:56:39,002 --> 00:56:40,732
- He never disappoints us. - It's like...

1486
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:42,302
- they put a thumb in here. - Are you talking about this?

1487
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:44,962
- You're very impressive. - It looks like a thumb.

1488
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:47,202
Does it look like this?

1489
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:49,002
It does look like a thumb.

1490
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:51,202
I've never smelled it before.

1491
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:53,562
- I don't know what it smells like. - I wonder what it smells like.

1492
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,862
It smells like my grandmother's pillow.

1493
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:58,602
(It means his grandmother used pork skin as her pillow all her life.)

1494
00:56:58,732 --> 00:57:01,662
It's so familiar like my grandmother's pillow.

1495
00:57:02,132 --> 00:57:04,932
- I don't know why, but it does. - Really?

1496
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:09,932
It's not an odour that gives you a bad feeling.

1497
00:57:10,102 --> 00:57:11,532
It's somewhat savoury.

1498
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,862
- Right? - It's a little savoury.

1499
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:15,802
Figuring it by taste is the problem.

1500
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:17,832
Making them taste it is...

1501
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:19,832
- It's cruel. - Sung Hoon.

1502
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:22,232
- Will he be okay? - Poor Sung Hoon.

1503
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:23,932
It's not something you can touch.

1504
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:33,862
- Hey, you. - Wait.

1505
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:36,102
You said you'd do everything.

1506
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,602
- That's not what I meant. - You said that to me.

1507
00:57:38,632 --> 00:57:40,462
You said you didn't know what to do because...

1508
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:42,232
you didn't fear anything.

1509
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:45,262
(Is this what you meant by having no fear?)

1510
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:46,702
He asked me, "What should I do?"

1511
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:49,462
I asked why. He said he didn't fear anything...

1512
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,162
and he was worried about the show getting boring.

1513
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:53,302
- I mean this is too... - Just eat it then.

1514
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:56,602
Would you push my head down?

1515
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,462
- Here you go. - Gosh.

1516
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:01,132
Put more of your tongue inside.

1517
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:05,832
(He gives up.)

1518
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,302
That's enough.

1519
00:58:07,332 --> 00:58:09,962
(He throws a fit after tasting pork skin.)

1520
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:11,102
Look at him.

1521
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:14,402
Do you give up?

1522
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:18,662
His actions are too different from his words.

1523
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:21,402
He tapped out.

1524
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,102
- Did someone attack you? - I mean this is really...

1525
00:58:24,432 --> 00:58:25,662
Please say the answer.

1526
00:58:26,032 --> 00:58:28,862
It doesn't have any taste.

1527
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:31,432
- I didn't taste anything at all. - That's right.

1528
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:35,102
It was like skin of fruit. It was like this.

1529
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,762
- He's getting close. - He's observant.

1530
00:58:38,002 --> 00:58:41,402
It's thin and slippery.

1531
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:43,962
- It had no taste. - It smelled savoury.

1532
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:45,602
Gosh, it's so difficult.

1533
00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:48,632
- This isn't it. - In 5, 4, 3...

1534
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:50,532
Why are you counting down?

1535
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:53,402
(It's a competition after all.)

1536
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:56,162
(If Gyeong Gyu gets the answer right, they get tie again.)

1537
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:58,402
- It had no taste. - We're doomed because of you.

1538
00:58:58,432 --> 00:58:59,562
Goodness.

1539
00:59:00,902 --> 00:59:03,902
(If Team Avengers answers more quickly, they get the hint.)

1540
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:07,462
(What is Gyeong Gyu's answer?)

1541
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:08,532
Fritters?

1542
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:09,932
Is it squid fritters?

1543
00:59:10,162 --> 00:59:11,332
(It's incorrect.)

1544
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:13,262
- Is it correct? - That wasn't even close.

1545
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:14,432
They almost got to the answer, though.

1546
00:59:15,162 --> 00:59:17,032
- Hye Jin is so competitive. - This is fun.

1547
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:18,762
(Team Running Man wins Round Two.)

1548
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,702
Take a look at the second one.

1549
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:23,032
Hye Jin, you know the second one, right?

1550
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:24,562
- Is it pork skin? - Yes.

1551
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:26,162
- How did you know? - It's pork skin.

1552
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,962
(Sorry, was it too difficult?)

1553
00:59:28,362 --> 00:59:31,162
- If I had known... - The winner of this round is...

1554
00:59:31,362 --> 00:59:32,602
Team Running Man.

1555
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:33,732
(Team Running Man receives a hint on the final mission.)

1556
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:36,632
- It's still neck and neck. - It's a tie anyway.

1557
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:37,662
We got one.

1558
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:39,302
- We got one, too. - That's right.

1559
00:59:39,332 --> 00:59:42,902
The final mission is "Name Tag Elimination".

1560
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,732
Each team decides a lucky and unlucky member from their team...

1561
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:48,532
and put a sticker under their name tags.

1562
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:51,302
If you take off a name tag of a lucky member,

1563
00:59:51,332 --> 00:59:54,562
you can not only eliminate the lucky member, but you can also...

1564
00:59:54,562 --> 00:59:57,602
eliminate an additional member of your choice within three minutes.

1565
00:59:57,632 --> 00:59:59,532
(Getting a lucky member will allow you to eliminate one more.)

1566
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:03,362
If you take off the name tag of an unlucky member, your team loses.

1567
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:04,962
Will the whole game be over?

1568
01:00:05,032 --> 01:00:07,102
Does the team lose if you take off an unlucky member's name tag?

1569
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:09,832
- Yes. The game ends then. - We have to be careful.

1570
01:00:09,862 --> 01:00:12,202
What if we take off a tame tag of an unlucky member?

1571
01:00:12,202 --> 01:00:13,702
- Do we get to go home? - Your team loses.

1572
01:00:13,732 --> 01:00:16,432
- I'll be the unlucky member. - Being unlucky is good.

1573
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:17,862
Let's look for the unlucky member.

1574
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:20,362
You want it to be over quickly instead of winning?

1575
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:22,502
Let's look for the unlucky member.

1576
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:24,362
I want to hit him.

1577
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:25,702
(Which team will be the final winner?)

1578
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:29,232
Did you decide on the lucky and unlucky member?

1579
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:31,032
Let's look for the hint.

1580
01:00:31,032 --> 01:00:32,332
Let's look for the hint first.

1581
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:35,132
Wait. We have to find the hint,

1582
01:00:35,162 --> 01:00:36,762
but this place is too big.

1583
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:39,162
- I don't know where to start. - Can we go inside the store?

1584
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:41,932
Don't you think the hint is in here?

1585
01:00:42,032 --> 01:00:44,962
I don't think many people looked through here.

1586
01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:48,102
Where is R?

1587
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,402
(Find the hint on who's lucky and unlucky.)

1588
01:00:49,402 --> 01:00:51,162
(You must find the hint to prevent from losing.)

1589
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:52,562
This place is huge.

1590
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:54,062
It really is.

1591
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,362
Even this store is big.

1592
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,802
(Goodness)

1593
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:02,132
We should leave.

1594
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:03,202
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

1595
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:05,462
- I didn't know. - I'm sorry.

1596
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:07,232
- I had no idea. - Come on, Jae Seok.

1597
01:01:07,232 --> 01:01:08,232
I really had no idea.

1598
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,332
(Meanwhile, Team Avengers are also searching for hints.)

1599
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,962
It will take forever to look through all these.

1600
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:13,332
(Goodness!)

1601
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:15,832
(Did Hee Jun finally find a hint?)

1602
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:20,232
Can't I have ice cream?

1603
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:22,532
(You said, you were on a diet.)

1604
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:24,462
This is so hard.

1605
01:01:24,462 --> 01:01:25,462
(Where are the hints?)

1606
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:26,902
How would it look like?

1607
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:30,802
- Are you the unlucky member? - Yes.

1608
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,062
Me, too.

1609
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:34,302
You received a hint, right?

1610
01:01:34,462 --> 01:01:35,562
No, I didn't.

1611
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:37,632
I thought you received one earlier.

1612
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:39,502
I'm coming to eliminate you.

1613
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:42,102
- Can I rip your name tag? - Yes, you can.

1614
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:43,332
- Seriously? - Yes, I'm serious.

1615
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,362
(You can rip it off if you want to.)

1616
01:01:45,562 --> 01:01:46,832
(Has Kwang Soo released an album before?)

1617
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:47,862
Well,

1618
01:01:48,532 --> 01:01:50,862
- you can eliminate me now. - Really?

1619
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:52,962
So only one of you are the unlucky member, right?

1620
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:55,932
- But the hint said that Ji Hyo... - One of you aren't the unlucky.

1621
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,502
and Kwang Soo can't be the unlucky.

1622
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,832
We'll receive a hint soon.

1623
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:04,662
- I'm pretty confident. - We can eliminate him.

1624
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,862
- We can eliminate Kwang Soo. - Why?

1625
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:08,102
He didn't release an album...

1626
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:13,962
Oh, I see.

1627
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:15,962
I see.

1628
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:17,702
(Kwang Soo runs off as soon as Key slips out the hint.)

1629
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:19,462
- What should we do? - Hurry.

1630
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:21,532
(Who is this?)

1631
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:23,462
(It's Jong Kook.)

1632
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:24,762
I just heard their hint.

1633
01:02:24,962 --> 01:02:25,962
Jong Kook!

1634
01:02:26,102 --> 01:02:27,732
- I'm such a fool. - Jong Kook!

1635
01:02:27,732 --> 01:02:28,732
(They can't approach easily because of Jong Kook.)

1636
01:02:28,732 --> 01:02:30,932
Jae Seok, their hint is someone who released an album.

1637
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:33,162
"Someone who released an album" must be their hint.

1638
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:36,032
- What? - "Someone who released an album".

1639
01:02:36,062 --> 01:02:39,732
- Why did you let it slip? - We promised not to reveal that.

1640
01:02:39,732 --> 01:02:41,132
- Oh my. - Goodness.

1641
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:43,002
I must be a fool!

1642
01:02:43,032 --> 01:02:44,762
(Gosh, I must be a food.)

1643
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,832
Ji Hyo!

1644
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,102
What? What's going on?

1645
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:51,132
"Someone who released an album" must be their hint.

1646
01:02:51,362 --> 01:02:53,232
- You mean that's the hint? - Yes, for the unlucky member.

1647
01:02:53,932 --> 01:02:55,062
So it's about our unlucky member.

1648
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:57,032
Ji Hyo, run away!

1649
01:02:57,802 --> 01:02:58,802
(We are their targets.)

1650
01:02:58,802 --> 01:02:59,832
What's happening?

1651
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:01,332
(We are their targets.)

1652
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:04,462
(Team Avengers are on their way to find other hints.)

1653
01:03:04,462 --> 01:03:07,002
- This place is suspicious. - There's nothing in here.

1654
01:03:07,002 --> 01:03:10,502
- This place is suspicious. - I feel there must be something.

1655
01:03:11,362 --> 01:03:13,002
It's somewhat suspicious.

1656
01:03:14,902 --> 01:03:15,932
What?

1657
01:03:18,702 --> 01:03:21,332
- Oh, my. It's here. - Did you really find one?

1658
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:23,432
- Where did you find it? - Good job.

1659
01:03:23,462 --> 01:03:26,562
It was in here. I spotted it when I was trying to sit on the swing.

1660
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:28,002
You are amazing.

1661
01:03:29,962 --> 01:03:32,632
- Nice job. - What? What's this?

1662
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:35,562
You'll get a hint if you choose the yogurt without vinegar.

1663
01:03:36,162 --> 01:03:37,332
- It's completely random. - I see.

1664
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:39,632
Since you have the box, why don't you try to pick one?

1665
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:41,162
Gyeong Gyu.

1666
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:43,502
Look at the colour. I can't tell from the colour.

1667
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:47,062
- I think number 7 is the yogurt. - Is this number 7?

1668
01:03:47,062 --> 01:03:49,462
- Isn't this number 1? - It's number 1.

1669
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:51,032
How can you say this is seven?

1670
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:53,762
My goodness. How could this be seven?

1671
01:03:53,762 --> 01:03:54,962
- I thought it was 7. - This is number 1.

1672
01:03:55,762 --> 01:03:56,932
- Please choose. - I choose number two.

1673
01:03:56,962 --> 01:03:58,762
(Gyeong Gyu chooses number 2.)

1674
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:00,632
- Now, drink it. - Yes.

1675
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:02,232
Does he need to drink it all at once? Oh, my.

1676
01:04:02,562 --> 01:04:05,262
- I think I know what it is. - What if it's the vinegar?

1677
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:06,532
(What will it be?)

1678
01:04:06,532 --> 01:04:08,002
(He drinks it down.)

1679
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:09,862
(It has to the yogurt to receive a hint.)

1680
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:11,562
This is amazing. Is that the vinegar?

1681
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:13,762
(Moving his mouth)

1682
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:15,132
- Is it the yogurt? - It's the yogurt!

1683
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:18,832
- Really? - Are you serious?

1684
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:21,832
I noticed it when you said "number seven".

1685
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:23,862
Let's see what number one is.

1686
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,162
(Oh, dear.)

1687
01:04:29,662 --> 01:04:32,432
(Congratulations. Number one was the vinegar.)

1688
01:04:32,432 --> 01:04:35,032
- That was amazing. - Well, it's...

1689
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:37,862
- Your face is turning red. - I think he is bloating.

1690
01:04:38,862 --> 01:04:40,932
- This is quite fun. - Yes, it is. This is exciting.

1691
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,202
The hint will be sent to your mission phone.

1692
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,062
- The mission phone. - Oh, it's here.

1693
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:47,062
- This fast? - It was really fast.

1694
01:04:47,062 --> 01:04:49,702
- It's because we're standing close. - Such a nice world we live in.

1695
01:04:50,132 --> 01:04:51,862
He could've just said it rather than sending a message.

1696
01:04:52,462 --> 01:04:53,962
- I know. - It's a nice world.

1697
01:04:53,962 --> 01:04:55,962
What a nice world we live in today.

1698
01:04:55,962 --> 01:04:58,662
- The unlucky member is single? - Unmarried?

1699
01:04:59,102 --> 01:05:01,802
- Then it must be Ji Hyo or Gary. - Ji Hyo or Gary.

1700
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:05,362
- Ji Hyo or Gary. - Kwang Soo is also single.

1701
01:05:05,532 --> 01:05:07,062
Or Jong Kook! There are four.

1702
01:05:07,062 --> 01:05:08,862
- There are so many. - Among them,

1703
01:05:08,862 --> 01:05:11,502
- Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo didn't... - They didn't released an album.

1704
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:14,632
- It must be Jong Kook or Gary. - Jong Kook or Gary.

1705
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:16,802
- Jong Kook or Gary. - So it's one of them.

1706
01:05:16,832 --> 01:05:20,462
- Jong Kook or Gary? - Yes. The unlucky is 1 of the 2.

1707
01:05:21,532 --> 01:05:23,962
There are four unmarried members.

1708
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:27,462
We found out that Jong Kook or Gary must be the unlucky member.

1709
01:05:27,462 --> 01:05:29,362
- They are all over there, now. - Are they together?

1710
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:31,132
- All of them are there. - Let's go.

1711
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:33,462
- Where? Where? - Sung Hoon could be the unlucky.

1712
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:37,902
- Right. - Key is very active.

1713
01:05:38,162 --> 01:05:40,232
- Dong Hyun might be the one. - I think I saw someone here.

1714
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:41,732
- There she is. - What?

1715
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:44,762
- It's Hye Jin. I feel sorry. - We need to eliminate her.

1716
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:45,862
Where are the others?

1717
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:47,062
(Is Hye Jin in trouble?)

1718
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,462
(Here you go.)

1719
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:53,102
(Is Hye Jin the unlucky member?)

1720
01:05:53,102 --> 01:05:54,102
(She tries to eliminate Kwang Soo.)

1721
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:57,362
- Wait a minute, Hye Jin. - I'll do it.

1722
01:05:57,362 --> 01:05:59,102
- Hye Jin. - Can I eliminate you?

1723
01:05:59,662 --> 01:06:01,162
(How dare you?)

1724
01:06:01,162 --> 01:06:02,832
You rip mine, and I'll rip yours.

1725
01:06:02,832 --> 01:06:05,162
- Can I eliminate you? - Can we really do this?

1726
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:07,962
- I have to go watch soccer. - She was trying to rip mine off.

1727
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:09,232
I have to hurry home to watch the soccer game.

1728
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,632
- You mean you need to go home? - Can I rip it off?

1729
01:06:11,632 --> 01:06:12,632
Sure.

1730
01:06:12,962 --> 01:06:15,462
Then we can all call it a day.

1731
01:06:15,462 --> 01:06:18,532
- Come on. - Why are you doing this?

1732
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:19,802
- Eliminate her. - Leave it.

1733
01:06:20,362 --> 01:06:22,732
(I don't think Hye Jin is the unlucky member.)

1734
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:24,002
(Ripping)

1735
01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:25,702
- Come on. - You ripped mine.

1736
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:27,362
- Eliminate her. - Hold on for now.

1737
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:28,902
(He ripped mine.)

1738
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:29,932
(She's such a good actress.)

1739
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,962
- Didn't he just rip mine? - You are such a good actress.

1740
01:06:32,062 --> 01:06:33,062
They're here.

1741
01:06:33,162 --> 01:06:34,432
(Team Avengers is here.)

1742
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:37,362
- Why? Go ahead. - Don't come near.

1743
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:38,962
(Finally, they are here.)

1744
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,262
- Wait a minute. - Hey!

1745
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,332
- What's going on? - No, it's fine. Eliminate me.

1746
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,602
Hey, don't go there.

1747
01:06:45,062 --> 01:06:46,332
(Running Man members could be hiding...)

1748
01:06:46,332 --> 01:06:48,032
- Don't go near them. - Gyeong Gyu.

1749
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:50,062
(like this.)

1750
01:06:51,462 --> 01:06:54,232
(Jong Kook was hiding when Team Avengers arrived.)

1751
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:56,002
(He sneaks from the back.)

1752
01:06:56,732 --> 01:06:58,432
(Gary, who was also hiding, approaches.)

1753
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:00,902
(Ripping)

1754
01:07:00,932 --> 01:07:02,062
(Sneaking)

1755
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:05,562
(Jong Kook and Gary make a surprise attack.)

1756
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:06,962
- He's eliminated. - They attacked from the back.

1757
01:07:06,962 --> 01:07:08,162
(Gyeong Gyu was not on the list from the beginning.)

1758
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,062
- What happened? - Let's leave. Let's go.

1759
01:07:11,062 --> 01:07:13,232
- We can't be here. - What's going on?

1760
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,932
We have to get Kwang Soo.

1761
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:17,162
(Is Gary in trouble?)

1762
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:20,232
(He escapes.)

1763
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:22,162
Don't eliminate Gary or Jong Kook!

1764
01:07:22,162 --> 01:07:24,532
(If we eliminate them rashly, we may end up losing the game.)

1765
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:25,932
Do not eliminate Gary or Jong Kook!

1766
01:07:26,162 --> 01:07:28,102
(They are running after them.)

1767
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:29,532
It's okay to eliminate him.

1768
01:07:29,532 --> 01:07:30,632
(Ripping)

1769
01:07:31,062 --> 01:07:32,902
- He's out. - Seok Jin is eliminated.

1770
01:07:32,902 --> 01:07:34,462
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1771
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:35,602
- He's eliminated. - Oh my.

1772
01:07:36,562 --> 01:07:37,862
(Jae Seok is cornered.)

1773
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:39,162
Eliminate Jae Seok!

1774
01:07:39,162 --> 01:07:40,602
(Eliminate Jae Seok!)

1775
01:07:40,802 --> 01:07:42,962
- Hold on. - Eliminate him!

1776
01:07:42,962 --> 01:07:44,232
(They're vigorously attacking Jae Seok.)

1777
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:45,662
- Wait a minute. - It's fine. Eliminate him.

1778
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,432
(Gary attempts to rescue Jae Seok.)

1779
01:07:47,462 --> 01:07:49,002
Hey! Get back! Not him!

1780
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:51,102
(Sung Hoon, you can't eliminate Gary!)

1781
01:07:51,102 --> 01:07:53,232
(If he's the unlucky member, then we are doomed.)

1782
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:54,902
Leave Gary alone!

1783
01:07:54,902 --> 01:07:57,162
(They can attack other members as much as they like.)

1784
01:07:57,732 --> 01:07:59,632
- Jong Kook! - Hyung Bin, Hyung Bin.

1785
01:08:01,062 --> 01:08:02,462
(Screeching)

1786
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:05,702
Eliminate Hyung Bin.

1787
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,362
(Haha is cornered.)

1788
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:09,332
We got him.

1789
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:10,362
Haha is eliminated.

1790
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:12,262
(Jong Kook sneaks in.)

1791
01:08:12,432 --> 01:08:14,172
Gary, eliminate him. Eliminate Hyung Bin.

1792
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:16,532
(Will he rip off Hye Jin's name tag?)

1793
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:19,062
(Earlier)

1794
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:20,232
Isn't this the hint box?

1795
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:22,672
(Ji Hyo found a hint box.)

1796
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:26,462
(A hint will be given if you pick the normal chopsticks.)

1797
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:28,962
(It's a success.)

1798
01:08:28,962 --> 01:08:32,462
(The unlucky member of Team Avengers uses a nickname.)

1799
01:08:32,462 --> 01:08:34,202
The unlucky member uses a nickname.

1800
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:36,332
- A nickname? - Yes.

1801
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:37,862
(If so...)

1802
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:40,862
(Since Hye Jin uses her real name, she can't be the unlucky.)

1803
01:08:40,862 --> 01:08:41,862
(Ripping)

1804
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,062
(Hye Jin is eliminated.)

1805
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:46,062
Eliminate him.

1806
01:08:46,062 --> 01:08:48,062
(Kwang Soo is confronting Key and Sung Hoon.)

1807
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,732
(Ripping)

1808
01:08:50,732 --> 01:08:52,532
(He succeeds.)

1809
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:55,532
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1810
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:58,172
(Team Avengers repaid their debt.)

1811
01:08:58,172 --> 01:09:00,172
- Good job. - Guys!

1812
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:01,962
Goodness.

1813
01:09:04,502 --> 01:09:06,762
- Are you all right? - Jae Seok.

1814
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:09,062
(Gyeong Gyu is coaching his team even when he's eliminated.)

1815
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:10,962
Who's that behind Jae Seok?

1816
01:09:10,962 --> 01:09:12,002
(Eliminating Jae Seok is only a matter of time.)

1817
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:17,062
(Jong Kook appears.)

1818
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:18,732
Hey. No way! Dong Hyun!

1819
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:21,432
- Goodness. - No way! Dong Hyun!

1820
01:09:21,432 --> 01:09:23,002
(He rips off Dong Hyun's name tag.)

1821
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:24,902
(Dong Hyun is the lucky member!)

1822
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:26,802
Dong Hyun is the lucky member.

1823
01:09:26,802 --> 01:09:27,802
(Team Avengers' lucky member is Dong Hyun.)

1824
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:31,262
We need to be prudent. Lucky member shouldn't get eliminated.

1825
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:34,462
- Yes, he shouldn't get eliminated. - So he needs to be strong.

1826
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,802
- I suggest Dong Hyun... - Right.

1827
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:38,902
- or Sung Hoon. - Okay. Let's do that.

1828
01:09:39,732 --> 01:09:41,862
Gary or Jong Kook is the unlucky member.

1829
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:43,632
We'll choose one to be eliminated.

1830
01:09:43,672 --> 01:09:45,802
- We should've eliminated Jae Seok. - Be careful!

1831
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:48,032
- Please be cautious. - In 1, 2, 3.

1832
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:49,462
- Hyung Bin. - Hyung Bin.

1833
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:51,502
- Hyung Bin is out. - He's out.

1834
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,832
- Me? - Yes.

1835
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:55,262
- Why? - You mean this is the end?

1836
01:09:55,332 --> 01:09:56,962
We also had a hint.

1837
01:09:57,332 --> 01:09:59,062
- You're not the unlucky member. - The hint says so.

1838
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,632
What do you take us for?

1839
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,462
We already know you're not the unlucky member.

1840
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:04,762
Any last words?

1841
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:06,332
(He rips off his own name tag.)

1842
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:09,002
- Nice. - Will you give me back my name tag?

1843
01:10:09,532 --> 01:10:11,002
It's okay to eliminate Jae Seok.

1844
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:16,262
(Remaining team members)

1845
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:18,632
There's a possibility that...

1846
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:22,362
they may think I'm too passive to be the unlucky member.

1847
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:24,962
I used guerrilla tactics and not attacked them actively.

1848
01:10:24,962 --> 01:10:27,462
But they might have perceived you as being active.

1849
01:10:27,462 --> 01:10:31,432
Since this is hit-or-miss, our option is Sung Hoon or Key.

1850
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:34,702
We'll have to make a choice and eliminate one. There's no other way.

1851
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:38,102
No, we have no idea what will happen when the situation gets tense.

1852
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:39,562
- Maybe it's Key. - It's so uncertain.

1853
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:41,862
I'm sure they are more confused than us.

1854
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:44,332
- You're right. - Yes, I'm sure they are.

1855
01:10:45,562 --> 01:10:47,402
Even if we have the hints,

1856
01:10:48,532 --> 01:10:50,862
taking the bull by the horns is the only way.

1857
01:10:50,862 --> 01:10:51,862
- There's no way to eliminate them. - Right.

1858
01:10:52,062 --> 01:10:55,362
- I think Jong Kook is the lucky. - In order for us to win,

1859
01:10:55,362 --> 01:10:57,802
we need to eliminate everyone except the unlucky member.

1860
01:10:57,802 --> 01:11:00,702
I think we should eliminate Jong Kook and Jae Seok.

1861
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:02,332
What about Ji Hyo? She's still alive.

1862
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:04,102
- Right, she's still alive. - Yes.

1863
01:11:04,102 --> 01:11:05,102
Then...

1864
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,832
- She must be the lucky member. - Yes.

1865
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:08,862
Is she?

1866
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,862
That's why they told her to hide and not to roam around.

1867
01:11:12,132 --> 01:11:14,262
- They must be over there. - Where? There?

1868
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:15,432
I can hear them.

1869
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:17,172
- There they are. - Yes. I can see them.

1870
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,002
- Where are they? - Right over there.

1871
01:11:19,502 --> 01:11:22,432
They are approaching us. They must have found all the hints already.

1872
01:11:23,562 --> 01:11:25,702
Come on, Hee Jun. Let's just fight.

1873
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:28,002
Let's finish this quickly.

1874
01:11:28,302 --> 01:11:29,632
- Yes. - It's hit-or-miss now.

1875
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,462
Remember. Jong Kook isn't our first target.

1876
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:33,802
Come on. Let's do it.

1877
01:11:34,232 --> 01:11:35,802
- Hee Jun. This way. - There's Jae Seok.

1878
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:37,932
Go. Let's rip his name tag first.

1879
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:40,432
(They are sure that Jae Seok isn't the unlucky member.)

1880
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:43,962
- Rip it off. - There.

1881
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:46,002
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1882
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:49,802
- Be careful. - Go for Jong Kook's name tag.

1883
01:11:49,802 --> 01:11:51,002
(One of them is the unlucky member.)

1884
01:11:52,202 --> 01:11:54,732
(Who is the unlucky one?)

1885
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:57,802
Come on, Jong Kook. Please.

1886
01:11:57,802 --> 01:11:58,902
(They are wrestling hand-to-hand.)

1887
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:01,172
Come on.

1888
01:12:01,172 --> 01:12:03,402
Jong Kook. Do you call this a variety show?

1889
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:04,702
This is a fighting show.

1890
01:12:04,932 --> 01:12:07,232
(Sung Hoon reaches out for a name tag.)

1891
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:10,602
(Is he trying to rip Jong Kook's name tag...)

1892
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:13,062
(or Gary's?)

1893
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:17,962
(Whom is he going to attack?)

1894
01:12:19,062 --> 01:12:20,302
Maybe there isn't anything.

1895
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,432
(Sung Hoon goes for Jong Kook's!)

1896
01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:23,402
- Gosh. - What?

1897
01:12:23,832 --> 01:12:26,102
(He rips off Jong Kook's name tag.)

1898
01:12:26,932 --> 01:12:31,102
(Team Avengers loses right away if Jong Kook is the unlucky member.)

1899
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:36,732
(If Jong Kook is the lucky member, they can eliminate Ji Hyo and win.)

1900
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:39,602
(How will this battle end?)

1901
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:40,672
- Gosh. - What?

1902
01:12:41,762 --> 01:12:44,502
(Jong Kook is the lucky member.)

1903
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:45,962
Where is it?

1904
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:47,262
Where is his name tag?

1905
01:12:47,302 --> 01:12:49,172
(We did it.)

1906
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,002
I couldn't rip his name tag off.

1907
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:54,172
(Hee Jun found a hint box.)

1908
01:12:54,172 --> 01:12:56,202
- I found one. Isn't this the one? - Where is it?

1909
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:57,232
- That's right. - Yes.

1910
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,832
I'll get a hint if I eat the one without mustard in it.

1911
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:00,332
Can we check?

1912
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:01,862
I succeeded.

1913
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:04,432
The unlucky member of Team Running Man uses a nickname.

1914
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:08,802
(Gary, who uses his nickname, was the unlucky member.)

1915
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:14,032
(Unlucky)

1916
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:17,172
- Choose one to be eliminated. - We will eliminate Ji Hyo.

1917
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:21,102
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1918
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,232
All right.

1919
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,632
Jae Seok shouldn't have been eliminated.

1920
01:13:24,402 --> 01:13:25,832
Team Avengers has won.

1921
01:13:25,832 --> 01:13:28,202
(Team Avengers has won.)

1922
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:30,862
The sequel is always better than the first.

1923
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:35,732
Today, we had Running Man versus Avengers Part 2...

1924
01:13:36,032 --> 01:13:37,202
and Team Avengers won.

1925
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:39,962
(Sung Hoon was the ace of Team Avengers today.)

1926
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:43,332
We will give this golden shield to Team Avengers.

1927
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,532
(The golden shield will be given to Team Avengers as the prize.)

1928
01:13:47,602 --> 01:13:49,802
Do you get it? Be modest.

1929
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:52,672
Why do you live like that? Act your age.

1930
01:13:52,672 --> 01:13:54,632
- Can you just do it? - You shouldn't scold him.

1931
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,762
- I'm not done yet. - Let's finish here.

1932
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:58,402
(Waiting to be penalised is more tiring than penalty itself.)

1933
01:13:58,402 --> 01:13:59,632
That must be more tiring.

1934
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:02,762
(Gyeong Gyu slaps his forehead.)

1935
01:14:03,532 --> 01:14:04,832
Did you hear that sound?

1936
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:06,262
He fell with a thud.

1937
01:14:06,262 --> 01:14:07,602
The sound resonated in this place.

1938
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:09,432
(Running Man vs Avengers Part 3 coming soon!)

1939
01:14:09,632 --> 01:14:10,672
(It's time for Running Man TV.)

1940
01:14:10,672 --> 01:14:11,702
- Hello. - Hello.

1941
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,232
(The most popular videos with the most popular keywords)

1942
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:14,502

1943

(Bring in anyone you want.)

1946
01:14:19,732 --> 01:14:21,202
(Show how charming you are.)

1947
01:14:21,202 --> 01:14:22,802
(Kwang Soo's channel)

1948
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:26,362
(You can't guess what's coming next.)

1949
01:14:26,432 --> 01:14:28,502
(Seok Jin's channel)

1950
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:31,362
(Meanwhile,)

1951
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:37,172
(there is a man wandering around Running Man members.)

1952
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,862
(The scene stealer)

1953
01:14:39,232 --> 01:14:42,602
