1
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:08,426
(On a fine day in autumn,)

2
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:12,996
(five items have been delivered to Running Man.)

3
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:16,756
(What would the items be?)

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,396
What's all this?

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:21,456
Coward, kid,

6
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,626
reggae, cooking...

7
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:24,896
and wit.

8
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,956
It all seems relevant to me, right?

9
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:31,396
Did you have to use that picture? Goodness.

10
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,796
(He's very muscular.)

11
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,126
The five items in front of you...

12
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:38,326
are the most popular search words about each of you.

13
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,996
Unlucky, grasshopper, cardboard,

14
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:42,096
James Bond and skinny jeans.

15
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:44,126
You mean these are the most popular search words about me?

16
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,026
Are we starting a mission already?

17
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,396
"Hot Race".

18
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:51,856
"For your individual mission, please make the most popular video."

19
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,996
"Hot Race".

20
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,726
"For your individual mission, please make the most popular video."

21
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,226
"A three-minute video you made...

22
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:01,156
will be opened to the public on the Internet."

23
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,426
"Members will be ranked according to the number of views of each video."

24
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:06,756
"The results will have a major impact on the next race."

25
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:09,026
You mean I need to make a three-minute video?

26
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,496
Please choose a keyword that you'd like.

27
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,326
Well, I think...

28
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:16,056
it's most likely that Jae Seok will win this mission.

29
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,296
Let's be realistic.

30
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,056
What am I supposed to do?

31
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:22,056
Goodness.

32
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:25,326
I think I have nothing to do with this one.

33
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:28,026
It's my face. That one's out.

34
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:29,626
There's no reason for me to choose that one.

35
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,926
I'm sure if I choose that one,

36
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,226
it'll make me do something like bungee jump...

37
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,926
Goodness. What's this? Soo Ae?

38
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:41,256
I'll need to cast her first if I am to choose that word.

39
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:43,356
- That's too much. - But we found that in the big data.

40
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:46,396
Did her name really come up in the big data?

41
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,856
Oh, well. Goodness.

42
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:51,526
I'll choose this one since I don't know what to expect.

43
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,656
- You mean the big nose? - Yes, I choose the big nose.

44
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,956
Since people call me dazed Ji Hyo,

45
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,856
I'll choose dazed Ji Hyo.

46
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,656
I'll choose 1 between these 2.

47
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,196
I'll choose this since it's been a while.

48
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,026
Should I shoot the members with this water gun?

49
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:10,196
(Members selected their keywords.)

50
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,926
We'll give you a mission regarding Trainer Kook.

51
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,296
Please make "Kook's 3-minute Workout" video.

52
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,056
Korea's favourite weakling will also feature in your show.

53
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,496
Who would this Korea's favourite weakling be?

54
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,296
Will Yoon Seok be on the show?

55
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,296
(If it's Korea's favourite weakling, will he be Yoon Seok?)

56
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,196
(Groaning)

57
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,756
(Shaking)

58
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,396
Is this 30kg?

59
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,496
(Who is this frail figure waiting for Jong Kook?)

60
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,826
Cinderella's nose?

61
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,956
"Find the Cinderella who only left behind the trace of a nose."

62
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:42,496
"The mould of Cinderella's nose and 'nose brothers' are given as hints."

63
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,796
So this must be similar to finding Cinderella's crystal shoe.

64
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,056
I need to find a nose instead of a crystal shoe, right?

65
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,496
- Is this the nose? - Yes.

66
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:51,056
(Who are you?)

67
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:53,226
Cinderella has such a high nose bridge.

68
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:56,456
Am I supposed to find whose nose this is?

69
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:59,396
Who are you? Whose nose is this?

70
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,326
I'm coming for you. Wait for me.

71
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:03,326
(Cinderella, I'm coming to find your nose.)

72
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,656
"Finding Ms Right."

73
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:09,156
"Go find a female celebrity who said Kwang Soo is her ideal type."

74
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,296
"Go on a date with her."

75
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:15,326
"It's a success if it turns out that Kwang Soo is really the ideal type."

76
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,796
Am I going on a date?

77
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,726
"Make a one-minute theme song for Running Man."

78
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,656
"But in the song, each member's voice...

79
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:27,326
must be included more than once."

80
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,296
(Laughing)

81
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:37,426
(Is this really my mission?)

82
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:41,056
"Compete with Crush who won the Space Out Contest."

83
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,196
"And find out who is the best at spacing out in Korea."

84
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:45,696
This is the mission for...

85
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,526
- James Bond. - What is it?

86
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:49,996
(What would Jae Seok's mission be?)

87
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,996
(Return of James Bond, Scene-stealer)

88
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,896
What? You mean I'm Scene-stealer?

89
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,356
Now, you've become Scene-stealer.

90
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:03,596
(Are you talking about something like a prominent supporting role?)

91
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,996
"You can steal 10 percent of others' views."

92
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:08,326
You mean I can steal their views?

93
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,056
I can steal the views from that specific member?

94
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,296
Really?

95
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:16,756
"But once they finish their mission, your identity will be revealed."

96
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,726
"If they eliminate you, you'll lose 50 percent..."

97
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,496
This is ridiculous!

98
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,996
You'll lose 50 percent of your views.

99
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,696
By all ways and means...

100
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,456
Ways and means are not the issue. There must be members...

101
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:31,026
who already noticed the Scene-stealer mission.

102
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,166
I'll give you a GPS.

103
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,626
You'll find out where they are.

104
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,056
What should I tell them about my mission?

105
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:38,126
(I should never get caught.)

106
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,026
(And from now on...)

107
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:43,026
What's this?

108
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,196
"Beware of Scene-stealer."

109
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,396
Scene-stealer?

110
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,396
Then there must be something.

111
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,196
Will someone show up when we film the video?

112
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,796
Let's start. So I need to make a three-minute video, right?

113
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,196
(Which member will have the highest views?)

114
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,326
Oh, dear. My goodness.

115
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,296
Have you heard of the Space Out Contest?

116
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:07,166
I don't know. Aren't you dazed Ji Hyo, by the way?

117
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:10,796
(Yes, I am.)

118
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,926
There's a contest called, the Space Out Contest.

119
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,196
There's a person...

120
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,456
who won first place...

121
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,626
and I need to compete against him.

122
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:23,726
Look at him.

123
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,656
Look at him. How can I possibly win against him?

124
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,626
There's a person I'd like to meet personally.

125
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,796
Can I make this an excuse for meeting the person?

126
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:36,126
- So this mission will be an excuse? - Yes, that's what I'll do.

127
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,326
The person I really hope to meet is...

128
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,526
There's a greater possibility that it won't happen.

129
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:41,756
Jeon Do Yeon.

130
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:43,626
(Jeon Do Yeon)

131
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:44,896
I wish I could meet her.

132
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:49,096
It'd be amazing if I ever get to meet her.

133
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,926
I'm sure my video would have the highest views.

134
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,496
What should I do when I go on a date?

135
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,496
(It's an unexpected date.)

136
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,656
I'm a person who loves to surprise a woman.

137
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,696
You should've let me know in advance to prepare for an event.

138
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,726
(I should've at least bought some candles.)

139
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:06,956
Who said I'm her ideal type?

140
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:07,956
(He searches celebrities who said he is their ideal type.)

141
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:09,826
Here's the title of an article.

142
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,526
"Beauties Like Kwang Soo."

143
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:15,456
(Lee Sun Bin and Kang Seung Hyun, Beauties Like Kwang Soo.)

144
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,726
Actress Moon Geun Young.

145
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:21,996
"Members of WJSN also picked Kwang Soo as their ideal man."

146
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,356
Even Kang Seung Hyun said, I'm her ideal type.

147
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,826
Seung Hyun picked me.

148
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,696
U Ie,

149
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,996
She wouldn't like me now.

150
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,326
(U Ie and Lee Sang Yun are in love.)

151
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,696
I get upset when they take advantage of me like this.

152
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,696
If you search, "Kwang Soo is my ideal type",

153
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:39,626
you get 23 pages of articles.

154
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,456
Song Ji Eun, a member of Secret,

155
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:43,826
"I think Kwang Soo is amazing."

156
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:47,196
It says, "Lately, I like Kwang Soo."

157
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,156
But this article was written in 2014.

158
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,026
It's been quite a while.

159
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,126
Did Jeong Eun Ji say that I'm her ideal type?

160
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,596
(Jung Eun Ji Picked Kwang Soo as Her Ideal Type. Why on Earth?)

161
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,626
(Kwang Soo is calling Jung Eun Ji.)

162
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,356
- Hello? - Eun Ji.

163
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,056
Why did you call me all of a sudden?

164
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,656
I'm filming Running Man right now.

165
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,026
- Okay. - I've been searching some articles.

166
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,226
- Yes.

167
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,996
I found that you picked me as your ideal type.

168
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,126
Why on earth did I do that?

169
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,626
(Why on earth did I do that?)

170
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:23,756
You can't do this to me right now.

171
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,596
I need to find a person who picked me as her ideal type.

172
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:30,896
You once picked me as your ideal type.

173
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,396
Well, yes.

174
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:33,856
What was the reason?

175
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,296
- When was it? - Why did I say that?

176
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,296
- Do you remember when? - No, I don't.

177
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,026
Then get lost.

178
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,396
(Kwang Soo is acting like bad guy.)

179
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,826
- Eun Ji. - That was annoying.

180
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:44,896
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,796
I need to find a person who thinks I'm her type of man.

182
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:49,756
- Okay. Good luck. - Thank you. I'll call you later.

183
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:51,496
- All right. Bye. - Bye.

184
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,856
Okay. She's off the list now.

185
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:57,226
(Eun Ji is off the list.)

186
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,856
(Kwang Soo calls the next person on the list right away.)

187
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,296
I haven't called her for a long time.

188
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,956
- Hello? - Hi, Geun Young.

189
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,826
(He's talking to the actress, Moon Geun Young.)

190
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:08,296
- Who is it? - Geun Young.

191
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,156
- Yes? - Hello.

192
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:11,826
Hello.

193
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:15,996
Well, it is embarrassing to say this myself,

194
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,456
but do you remember saying that I'm your ideal type of man?

195
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,456
No, I didn't mean it that way.

196
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,296
One's ideal type always changes, doesn't it?

197
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,726
You means I'm not your type any more?

198
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:29,156
I'm sorry, Geun Young.

199
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,626
(I'm not your type of man any more?)

200
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:34,266
I'm so sorry to bother you.

201
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,296
- That's okay. - Okay.

202
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:39,326
I'm just going to date anyone.

203
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,026
What do you mean?

204
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,596
I told you that I'm recording Running Man right now.

205
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,326
Are you?

206
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,426
What do you mean you want to date anyone?

207
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,426
I want more dating experience.

208
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,126
(Well...)

209
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,356
- Okay. Geun Young. - Yes?

210
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,296
Are you drunk?

211
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,056
- What are you talking about? - I'm really flustered right now.

212
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,796
- Are you? Okay. I see. - Yes.

213
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:04,056
- All right. I will call you later. - Okay. Bye.

214
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,396
(He quickly hangs up.)

215
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:08,526
Okay. Geun Young seems a bit drunk right now.

216
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:12,356
She says that someone's type changes over time.

217
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,596
("One's ideal type changes.")

218
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,426
She made her point.

219
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:20,526
(Who is the next candidate?)

220
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:23,426
- Hello? - Hello?

221
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,796
- Seung Hyun. - Yes?

222
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,156
Well...

223
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:28,526
(He's talking to the model, Kang Seung Hyun.)

224
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,096
You... Well, Seung Hyun.

225
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,696
Why did you call me?

226
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,926
What do you mean, "Why did you call me?"

227
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:40,766
I found out that you appointed me as your ideal type of man before.

228
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,026
No. I didn't mean it that way.

229
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,626
It came up during a small talk and we were talking about petty things.

230
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:48,226
It might be petty, but it could be important.

231
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,156
Where did you read the article? That is...

232
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,126
I searched for it myself.

233
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,766
That's not important. This is the important bit.

234
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,526
You appointed me as your ideal type, didn't you?

235
00:09:57,696 --> 00:10:01,826
- I did. - I'll give you a chance to date me.

236
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,596
- You're giving me a chance? - Why are you laughing out loud?

237
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,296
I'm actually nervous. Okay.

238
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:11,026
- Such an honour this is. - Hey, Seung Hyun.

239
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:12,996
Where are you right now?

240
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,026
I'm walking my dog in front of my house.

241
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:18,196
- Oh, are you? - Yes.

242
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:20,456
- I'll see you there then. - Okay.

243
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:21,626
(Kwang Soo will go on a date with Seung Hyun.)

244
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,926
I haven't dated anyone for quite a long time.

245
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,326
(Will she still consider Kwang Soo as her ideal type?)

246
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,266
It's a lovely day for a date.

247
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:29,926
I could really get into it.

248
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,296
This must be the place.

249
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:33,826
Hey, Seung Hyun.

250
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,726
(Laughing)

251
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:37,896
Hey, Seung Hyun.

252
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:40,826
(They are embarrassed to see each other.)

253
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:41,996
Hey, Seung Hyun.

254
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,926
(She's Korea's famous supermodel, Kang Seung Hyun.)

255
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,626
Long time no see.

256
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,156
Did you put on makeup?

257
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,826
Yes, I did.

258
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,356
It's a date. I haven't been on a date for ages.

259
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,096
- What? Yes, we have a mission. - What's the mission?

260
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:55,896
What's wrong?

261
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,856
(Barking)

262
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,596
- What's the matter? - I don't know. He's acting strange.

263
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,826
(Stay away from Seung Hyun!)

264
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,196
Oh, my.

265
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:08,496
It's Haha.

266
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,496
- Yes, Haha. - Hey, Kwang Soo.

267
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,296
What's your mission? Do you have to find your first love?

268
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,226
No, I need to find someone who likes me...

269
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,056
and said that I'm her type.

270
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:21,396
- I need to cook. I'm on my way. - I see.

271
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:26,026
Are you on your way to see who appointed you as her type, too?

272
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,896
No way. I'm married with a kid.

273
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,096
(He's married.)

274
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,896
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:35,826
(Don't worry. I met my woman a long time ago.)

276
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:38,296
- Anyway, have fun. - Okay, Haha.

277
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,526
- I'll call you later. - Sure.

278
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,196
I need to search the Internet.

279
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:44,996
(Haha has to cook "Haha's Dish" with food only from convenience store.)

280
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,656
I've found them already.

281
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,456
"120 convenience store dishes".

282
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:51,496
What is "Mark's Dish"?

283
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,496
"For your information, the reason why..."

284
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:58,256
"it's called Mark's Dish is because Mark's fan invented the menu."

285
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,526
It's really popular right now.

286
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:03,396
(Okay, Mark. I choose you!)

287
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,396
We need to...

288
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:08,156
cook a proper dish, but we also need to add...

289
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:10,096
something more stimulating to it.

290
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,026
(It must be hot, no matter what.)

291
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,956
We're at JYP Entertainment agency.

292
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,826
We need Mark for "Mark's Dish".

293
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:19,526
Let's go. Just push ahead.

294
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:21,256
Mark?

295
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,326
Mark? I knew I could count on you.

296
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,726
You're all set.

297
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:28,526
- Hello. - Hi, Mark.

298
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:30,096
(Mark from Got7)

299
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,456
Yes. We're all set.

300
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:35,056
To be honest, I was a bit worried.

301
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:36,626
Mark, here's your microphone.

302
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:37,896
(Why is Haha holding Mark's microphone?)

303
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:38,996
I'll set it for you.

304
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,626
It's all being recorded, right?

305
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:44,526
Stay focused. Don't miss anything. Not even the shortest moment.

306
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,396
Come on, I'll do it for you.

307
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,426
(Mark,)

308
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:54,026
(I need your help.)

309
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:56,396
Come on, I'll do it for you.

310
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,656
(Ta-da)

311
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,696
Why? What's wrong?

312
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,656
(Is Mark's sexy body the stimulant of the show?)

313
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,826
No. I'll do it for you.

314
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:09,426
- There you go, Mark. - I can do it myself.

315
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,956
No, don't put it that way.

316
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,626
(Haha lifts up Mark's shirt.)

317
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:19,396
(Come on, Mark. I really want to win this game.)

318
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,126
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

319
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,226
How should we do this? Where are your group members?

320
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:26,726
- They are off on their holidays. - How about you?

321
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,296
- I couldn't go home. - Why not?

322
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:29,656
My home is in Los Angeles. It's too far.

323
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,956
All the other members went home for Chuseok,

324
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,326
- and you're staying here? - Yes.

325
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:39,626
(How are you, Mum?)

326
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:46,426
(You must be having a hard time. I know what you are going through.)

327
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,026
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am. Please stop.

328
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:51,526
(Haha successfully lifts Mark's shirt for the second time.)

329
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,626
(We have to work on this anyway, so let's do our best and win together.)

330
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,196
All right. I'll be honest with you.

331
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:01,056
I thought it wouldn't be really fun if we just cook.

332
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,396
That's why I was showing some skin.

333
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:03,856
- Is that your idea? - Yes.

334
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:04,996
So...

335
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,196
(Why didn't you tell me earlier?)

336
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,896
(I'll do my best to secure the first place.)

337
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,526
Yes. That's the spirit.

338
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:12,296
What about Mark and I go to sauna and eat half-naked?

339
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,526
- We can just cook half-naked. - Really?

340
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,926
Can you do that for me? He's really cool.

341
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,296
He's so open-minded.

342
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,796
They are already set out.

343
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,796
What should we do with these?

344
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:28,426
Well, Park Jin Young is here.

345
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:30,726
(Park Jin Young?)

346
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:32,596
- Is Park Jin Young here? - Yes.

347
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:33,896
(Park Jin Young? You mean JYP?)

348
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:34,996
- Is Jin Young here? - Yes.

349
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,896
(Of course, not.)

350
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,456
That was a good one. Nice to see you.

351
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:44,956
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Come this way.

352
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,096
We have Junior JYP, too.

353
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,656
We're going to cook "Haha's Dish".

354
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,756
- Are you a good cook? - Me?

355
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,696
- I'm good at cutting things. - Really?

356
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:54,796
- Yes, I am. - Really?

357
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,326
All right. First,

358
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,726
take off your top.

359
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,256
(Take off your top.)

360
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,956
(Do you want us to take off our clothes?)

361
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,156
- We're back. - Okay.

362
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:06,126
Awesome! You look great.

363
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,296
This is just amazing.

364
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,896
You need to take off your shirt, too.

365
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:12,696
Okay, I will. Really.

366
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,956
(Do you really want me to take off my shirt, too?)

367
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,056
(Seriously?)

368
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,256
You look nice.

369
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,956
Show people how determined you are.

370
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:23,026
Now, we are a team.

371
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:25,226
I'm just doing it because you want me to,

372
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,096
but this won't affect the outcome at all.

373
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,326
(Their indecent cooking show begins now.)

374
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,296
Let's cook curry udon first.

375
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:35,596
Wow. We have a lot of desserts.

376
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:39,026
I will boil this because we need a bit of curry sauce for those.

377
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,526
- Got it. - Okay.

378
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:44,256
(Mix some instance curry sauce with water and boil.)

379
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,596
Please open up the udon.

380
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,456
When you serve those, don't serve them like any other.

381
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,926
- Do you mean this? - Show off your body when you serve.

382
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,526
(Haha's trying to show off his physical beauty.)

383
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:56,726
(We need you to watch this.)

384
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:57,856
That's great.

385
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,726
Amazing.

386
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,496
("Click Bait")

387
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,696
That's great.

388
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:08,496
(Thank you in advance for your views.)

389
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:10,126
We have a great teamwork.

390
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:15,756
(Add the instant udon sauce and an egg...)

391
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:18,496
(and boil them together with the curry sauce.)

392
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:20,356
This will taste great. I'm sure of it.

393
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:27,926
(Throw the sauce over the cooked noodles.)

394
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,596
(That looks quite nice.)

395
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,496
You're a good cook.

396
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:35,156
- We're making it just like pizza. - Yes, that's right.

397
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,126
Based on the idea,

398
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,656
I'll put some cheese on it.

399
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,456
Rip crab sticks in smaller pieces. Wash your hands before this.

400
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:46,296
Then I will throw in some salad, which are really healthy...

401
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:47,496
and mix them together.

402
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,756
(Rip crab meats in smaller pieces and mix with salad.)

403
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,496
This looks quite delicious.

404
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:56,426
(Put the mixed salad on a slice of puffed rice.)

405
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,456
To finish off with a bit of flavour,

406
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:04,696
put some sliced dried laver on it.

407
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,696
- It's delicious. - One dish is ready.

408
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,926
Put it over there nicely.

409
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,466
Put it on that large dish.

410
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,696
That's it. You're doing great.

411
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,256
(They know what to do to get more nunber of views.)

412
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,796
That's it. You're doing great. Show your physical beauty.

413
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,526
(Haha is definitely getting more views on his video with them.)

414
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,966
Show it more. Great.

415
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,526
(This is really embarrassing.)

416
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:28,826
Thank you. Thank you so much.

417
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,626
Where are you, Jae Seok?

418
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,126
What are you up to, Seok Jin?

419
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:38,896
I need to ask you something.

420
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,026
What is it?

421
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,996
Didn't you go to school with Jeon Do Yeon?

422
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:44,466
Yes, that's right.

423
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,756
Can you call her that casually?

424
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,426
Of course.

425
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:50,056
This is the reason why I called you.

426
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:53,796
I want to meet with her with my mission as an excuse.

427
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,356
We used to be close.

428
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:59,256
Used to? That's past tense.

429
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:02,526
Do you have her number?

430
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,256
I used to know, but now I don't.

431
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:09,926
The last time I saw her was at a car wash.

432
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:10,926
When was that?

433
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,926
That was in 1997.

434
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,896
(I saw Do Yeon in 1997.)

435
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,526
(Reply 1997)

436
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:19,626
I'm hanging up.

437
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:22,026
- What? - You're no help at all.

438
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:24,196
- What are you talking about? - That was 20 years ago.

439
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:27,626
Do you know how glad she was when we met back then?

440
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,926
That was 20 years ago at a car wash.

441
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,196
- Yes, it was. - Are you kidding me?

442
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,526
You're useless.

443
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,526
(Seok Jin will have to come up with a different plan.)

444
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:40,156
(How is Ji Hyo preparing for the Space Out Contest?)

445
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:44,056
(She arrived at Crush's studio.)

446
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:46,826
Oh, my.

447
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,496
Hello.

448
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,126
Is this your studio?

449
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:54,966
(He's dazed already.)

450
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,526
(He's the hottest musician at the moment. It's Crush.)

451
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:03,296
(He is the winner of the Space Out Contest.)

452
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:06,856
The weather is perfect to space out.

453
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,726
- Take this first. - Okay.

454
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,356
- Read it out loud. - I accept your challenge.

455
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,696
"Crush, I challenge you."

456
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,466
"Let's see who's the best at spacing out."

457
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,256
This is nuts.

458
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,526
(I accept your challenge, dazed Ji Hyo.)

459
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,826
This is nonsense.

460
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:27,356
What is this trophy? Is this it?

461
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:31,256
(She found the trophy he received for winning the Space Out Contest.)

462
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,466
2016 Han River Space Out Contest.

463
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:35,966
May 21.

464
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:37,856
He won this.

465
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,696
This is who he is.

466
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:43,026
Look at this.

467
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,626
Look at this trophy.

468
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,696
You're putting me up against someone like this?

469
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,056
This is so funny.

470
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,596
I watched some episodes of Running Man.

471
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:56,926
I think you could be a match for me.

472
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,826
I'm not like that.

473
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,096
Am I the only one who thinks that?

474
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,296
You got me all wrong.

475
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,126
Anyway, let's head out. The weather's nice out.

476
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:09,056
Let's take a walk outside.

477
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:10,896
(Will she be able to get the most views and win?)

478
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,156
How do we get more views?

479
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,996
(Gary gathers everyone he knows to help him out.)

480
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,896
I'm sorry, Se Yun.

481
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,466
This is Panda.

482
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,356
(Professional musicians team up to create a minute-long theme song.)

483
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:30,256
This is my long-time friend from elementary school.

484
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:31,326
Nice to meet you.

485
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,896
They've worked with many Korean artists.

486
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,426
Wait a minute.

487
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:40,726
I have to put other members' voices in there.

488
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,426
- The members of Running Man? - They all have to go in the song.

489
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:46,796
(They're having conversations with music terminology.)

490
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,256
- That's a good idea. - It could work.

491
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,926
Maybe I'll get them to sing along and record it all together.

492
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,466
(He's calling Ji Hyo to record her voice.)

493
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,096
She's probably spacing out right now.

494
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,656
She could already be doing it.

495
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,756
(He has another phone ready for recording.)

496
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:03,756
Hey.

497
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,826
- Ji Hyo? - Hi.

498
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:08,196
- Where are you? - I'm with Crush.

499
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:10,026
- You are? - Yes.

500
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,656
Where did you say you were going? Hannam-dong?

501
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:15,056
No, we're going to Jamwon, near Banpo-dong.

502
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:16,826
- Oh, Han River? - Yes.

503
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,156
Are you here right now?

504
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,826
I thought I might meet you there.

505
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,356
Sure, come over.

506
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,626
Hey, Gary.

507
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:26,396
- Hey, Crush. - Long time no see.

508
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,626
- How have you been? - Good, thanks.

509
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,466
Be good to Ji Hyo, Crush.

510
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,596
Of course, she's really pretty.

511
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,526
Don't seduce her.

512
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:38,156
See you there, Crush.

513
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,526
- Okay. - Goodbye.

514
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:42,026
- I'll hang up now. - Okay.

515
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:45,196
I could even get Crush's voice in there.

516
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:52,126
(He's going over the conversation.)

517
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:54,656
Ji Hyo sounds so happy.

518
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,356
(She does sound really excited.)

519
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,996
She does. Is that because of Crush?

520
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,456
- I'm with Crush. - You are?

521
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,796
She laughs when she says his name.

522
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:06,756
Are you jealous?

523
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:07,996
Are you kidding me?

524
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:09,626
(Is this what jealousy feels like?)

525
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,056
Did you write the lyrics yet?

526
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:12,656
- Be quiet. - Okay.

527
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:15,226
I have to go there quickly.

528
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,526
I kidnapped Crush from his studio.

529
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:22,056
He's very confused right now.

530
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:23,656
(Running Man's Space Out Contest is about to begin.)

531
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,026
He needs to be looked after.

532
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,856
We even have a judge today.

533
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:28,856
(The founder of the Space Out Contest and judge, Woops Yang)

534
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:33,456
We will now begin Running Man's Space Out Contest.

535
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:37,056
(It's Ji Hyo against Crush.)

536
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:44,626
(The person to keep the steadiest heart rate will become the winner.)

537
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,856
What I do is...

538
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:51,526
I sing the lyrics of my songs in my head.

539
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:53,656
So I can't fall asleep, right?

540
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:57,956
I have to stay calm and space out, right?

541
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,626
(It won't be as easy as you think, Ji Hyo.)

542
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:06,526
(Space Out Contest starts now.)

543
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:21,196
(They're spacing out.)

544
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:26,056
(The video is not paused.)

545
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:30,526
(This video is also not paused.)

546
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:36,126
(How can they be this calm?)

547
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:40,156
(Running Man is very strange today.)

548
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:48,726
(We should call the show Sitting Man.)

549
00:23:49,756 --> 00:23:54,826
(What's this?)

550
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:59,656
(These are embarrassing pictures of them.)

551
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:04,056
(What's this?)

552
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:07,856
(He's completely ignoring it.)

553
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:13,726
(They're trying to make their heart rates go higher.)

554
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:17,956
(She looks peaceful so far.)

555
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:19,926
(He glances at the picture.)

556
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:22,456
(This looks dangerous.)

557
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,356
(What do they have this time?)

558
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,526
(These are even more embarrassing pictures.)

559
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:32,656
(You won't hold it in this time.)

560
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:35,156
(She can't hold it in.)

561
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,856
(This won't be easy for you, either.)

562
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:43,826
(He's about to burst into laughter.)

563
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:52,756
(Somebody help me.)

564
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:02,456
(They're measuring their heart rates after the interruption.)

565
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:09,896
(The results are taken right back to the judge.)

566
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,026
(Gary shows up.)

567
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,656
Are you doing it right now?

568
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:18,356
You don't stand a chance against Crush.

569
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:20,496
Are you not allowed to speak?

570
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,196
You can't talk?

571
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,726
I need them to talk.

572
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,056
(What is it? Come here.)

573
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:31,926
I need to make a theme song.

574
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:33,856
Just shout, "Run".

575
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,526
(This is ridiculous.)

576
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,896
Don't laugh, Ji Hyo.

577
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:39,296
(This guy is in another world.)

578
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:42,826
I haven't seen Crush since last year and he's not even saying hi to me.

579
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:44,656
(He's keeping his glance forward.)

580
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,496
Just give me a shout.

581
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,856
(Gary tries to record Ji Hyo's voice.)

582
00:25:51,656 --> 00:25:52,896
Say that again?

583
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,096
(She barely makes a sound.)

584
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,926
I just need you to say one word!

585
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,096
(It's not like I don't want to.)

586
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:07,896
(She blows into the microphone.)

587
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,096
(It doesn't look like he will be getting anything good out of her.)

588
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,296
You said all I needed was her voice.

589
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:13,756
This is what your voice sounds like.

590
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,996
(It's the sound she made when she blew into the microphone.)

591
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:23,626
Do you hear that? I can't use this. Just say run.

592
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:25,956
Run.

593
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:27,526
That's it.

594
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:29,456
Hey, Crush.

595
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:32,456
Say what you want to say.

596
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:34,656
Go away.

597
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,156
(It was short but strong.)

598
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:40,696
Do you think I can record a song with this?

599
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:42,526
Go away.

600
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:43,896
(I must not laugh.)

601
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:46,296
At least I got what I came for.

602
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:47,826
Thank you, everyone.

603
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:51,356
Don't stay in the sun for too long. Good luck.

604
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:53,996
(Bye, Gary.)

605
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,196
This is hard.

606
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,256
(Ji Hyo goes back to spacing out.)

607
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:02,696
I feel drained already.

608
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:06,526
I need the voices of Kwang Soo, Jong Kook and Seok Jin.

609
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:08,826
I only got one syllable out of them and I'm already tired.

610
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:11,396
(Kwang Soo receives a call while he's on a date.)

611
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:12,456
It's Gary.

612
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,456
- Hello, Gary? - Hey, Kwang Soo.

613
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:18,196
- What's up? - Can you say run?

614
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:19,896
- Run? - Yes.

615
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:21,496
Give me a shout.

616
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:23,826
Run!

617
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:24,996
Run!

618
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:26,156
Run.

619
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:28,256
(The sound of Seok Jin's run sucks the energy out of you.)

620
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:29,526
What?

621
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:32,196
(Seok Jin has more to offer.)

622
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,626
- Was that good? - Goodness.

623
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,726
Shall we record "Left ear, right ear, Seok Jin is out"?

624
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:39,056
(He gets an idea from Seok Jin.)

625
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,526
Please listen to the song with headphones on.

626
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,626
Left ear, right ear

627
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:46,926
(Did he just create a new theme song?)

628
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,796
(They start to make a song with voice recordings.)

629
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:51,826
Shall we start with something like that?

630
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:53,796
- Play it. - Did you make...

631
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:54,896
a sample already?

632
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,626
(He adds a beat to the members' voice recordings.)

633
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,796
(It sounds so good.)

634
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:07,726
(What's wrong with the sound?)

635
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,656
It sounds like...

636
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,396
a video game.

637
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:14,656
(It's a sound you often heard at the arcade.)

638
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:20,226
(The sound makes you want to insert coins.)

639
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:24,056
(The hottest one-minute theme song is coming soon.)

640
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:27,026
What's your ideal type of men?

641
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:28,226
Lee Kwang Soo.

642
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,156
Why is that?

643
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:32,296
I like...

644
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,796
(I like...)

645
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:40,256
(Tell me why I'm your ideal type.)

646
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:44,426
I like people who are big.

647
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:48,196
You might as well like Seo Jang Hoon.

648
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,256
Isn't that what you mean?

649
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,356
We have to go on a date. What kind of date do you usually like?

650
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:57,126
Since I have a dog,

651
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:00,426
I enjoy walking the dog together and chatting.

652
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,256
I enjoy having conversations like this.

653
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,926
It's a Hollywood-style date.

654
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,696
A date while walking the dog.

655
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:10,126
(I know what that feels like.)

656
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:14,526
(He attracts her by going on a Hollywood-style date with her.)

657
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:17,496
(He prepares a romantic date.)

658
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,426
(The dog barks aggressively.)

659
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,056
I have an incoming call.

660
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,296
(The reality is that the dog barks randomly.)

661
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:24,356
Ji Hyo is calling.

662
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:25,896
Hello, Ji Hyo.

663
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:29,126
- Where are you? - Right now, I am...

664
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:30,796
What kind of tone is that?

665
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,156
Hello, Jae Seok.

666
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:34,896
Jae Seok.

667
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:37,256
For today's date, so many people...

668
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,526
- Hello. - are helping me out.

669
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,456
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

670
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:44,326
- I'm on a date now. I'll call back. - Long time no see.

671
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:47,726
He said he's looking for people whose ideal type of men is him.

672
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:48,856
Seung Hyun said I'm her ideal type.

673
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,026
- Is that why you met him now? - Yes.

674
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:53,426
- We'll go on a date. - I know this is just a mission.

675
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:56,426
- However, Kwang Soo, - Yes.

676
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,296
pardon me for saying this, but what a dirty trick.

677
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,296
A dirty trick?

678
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:01,126
- It is. - We're just starting our date.

679
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:04,526
- What's wrong with you? - I'm not sure when she said it,

680
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:07,396
but he came to her to ask if she likes him.

681
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,196
I don't remember, but I was shocked that he knew about it.

682
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:12,026
- What do you mean? - Don't you remember, Seung Hyun?

683
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:14,126
- No. - You should be more aware.

684
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,526
Don't say that to a world-class model.

685
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,956
I looked it up and found out I actually said it.

686
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:19,996
When did you say it?

687
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:22,026
It's been a few years ago at least.

688
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:23,596
- Kwang Soo, what is that? - Come on.

689
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,696
Come on, Jae Seok.

690
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,456
(He backs away from Kwang Soo.)

691
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:29,856
Gosh, that's such a dirty little trick.

692
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:32,296
- I'm still your ideal type. - Right.

693
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,626
- She says it's still the case. - Right.

694
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:35,726
Why did you say that back then?

695
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:37,226
At that time,

696
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:41,526
Jang Ki Ha asked me if I enjoyed being on Running Man.

697
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,496
Leave it, I'll do it for her.

698
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:45,396
Are you okay?

699
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:48,996
(He's good at interrupting. What's going on here?)

700
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:51,526
(Is Jae Seok Scene-stealer I should be cautious of?)

701
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:53,826
- You should show your face. - He asked if I enjoyed the show...

702
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,996
- and which member is my ideal type. - I see.

703
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,626
Was it among Running Man members?

704
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:00,656
See? This is what was missing.

705
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,996
- Was it among Running Man members? - Seung Hyun's answer...

706
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:05,326
wasn't her ideal type in the entertainment industry.

707
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,496
- Was it me out of six people? - This was missing.

708
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:09,596
Seung Hyun.

709
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:12,756
Who's your ideal type in the entertainment industry?

710
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:14,156
Kwang Soo.

711
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:16,026
- Really? - Be quiet.

712
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,626
You lost your chance.

713
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:21,456
Things seem quite uncomfortable between you two.

714
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:23,496
What would you have done if I weren't here?

715
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,526
(If you weren't here, we would be enjoying our date.)

716
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:29,096
I definitely have a potential.

717
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,656
- Have you eaten? - No.

718
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:31,796
Let's go eat.

719
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,796
What are you doing right now?

720
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:36,926
- Are you trying to ruin my date? - Let's go eat.

721
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,256
You haven't eaten, right?

722
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:40,156
There's a cafe nearby.

723
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:41,256
Shall we go there?

724
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:45,656
(He's very suspicious.)

725
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:49,626
Two iced coffee, please.

726
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:50,856
(Their Hollywood-style date starts at a cafe.)

727
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:52,626
I enjoy things like this for a date...

728
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,326
instead of doing something special.

729
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,656
I like doing things that are ordinary.

730
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,126
Since with your last girlfriend,

731
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,656
you haven't been on a cafe date in a while, have you?

732
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,056
- It's been a while. - Right?

733
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,796
(The three are slowly getting to know each other.)

734
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:08,356
(Don't worry about me.)

735
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:12,126
He's definitely Scene-stealer. He's always in my sight.

736
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,656
- Jae Seok, look over there instead. - I didn't do anything.

737
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:17,226
- Go and play with the dog. - He's always around us.

738
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,296
Gosh.

739
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:21,196
- I'll leave after I get my drink. - She keeps looking at you.

740
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:22,496
I'll leave after I get my drink.

741
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:23,996
(He's a professional interrupter.)

742
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,826
Let's not ask about each other's past.

743
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:30,156
It's because he wants a casual relationship.

744
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:32,396
What do you want?

745
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:34,196
- Do you want my name tag? Take it. - No.

746
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:35,356
I would have done that already.

747
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:38,056
- Goodness. - Are you on some kind of mission?

748
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:39,296
No, I'm not.

749
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,356
I'm leaving after I get my drink.

750
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:46,096
I feel like a third wheel at Kwang Soo and Jae Seok's date.

751
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:50,096
- I'm not sure how to act. - Okay.

752
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,356
Sit on this seat, Seung Hyun.

753
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:53,056
Sit on this seat.

754
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,426
- That's what it feels like. - You're so sensitive.

755
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:58,526
All right, let me get my toast.

756
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:01,896
Isn't it ready yet? Here it is.

757
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,356
(What is he really up to?)

758
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:06,756
How do I take it?

759
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:11,326
How do I take it?

760
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:14,956
(What does he mean by that?)

761
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:20,496
- If you bring up the past... - Are we...

762
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:24,996
on a date or not?

763
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,426
Sir.

764
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,626
- Stop moving around. - Pardon me.

765
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:31,796
I really have to leave for my mission now.

766
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:34,096
I was very happy and grateful...

767
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,956
- that you came to see me. - Me, too.

768
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:40,296
It wasn't about having fun. I took it seriously.

769
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,626
- I took it seriously and... - Continue your conversation.

770
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:44,926
- I took it seriously and... - Continue your conversation.

771
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,396
Kwang Soo, can you put your foot here?

772
00:33:46,396 --> 00:33:48,296
(He asks for Kwang Soo's foot.)

773
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,996
Is he mentally sick?

774
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,796
Why are you asking for my foot when I'm on a date?

775
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,126
I need to make a tracing of everyone's feet.

776
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,696
- You can do it for me, right? - Sure.

777
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,626
Come on, please let me do it.

778
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:03,356
- It can be embarrassing. - Gosh.

779
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:04,356
I just need your foot.

780
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,496
Is it so difficult to put your foot on this?

781
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,526
- Come on. - Gosh.

782
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,956
I also need to get tracings of other members' feet.

783
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:11,726
Wait a minute.

784
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,196
- Is this what I think it is? - What?

785
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,656
Is this your mission?

786
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,096
I have to get tracings of six members' feet...

787
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:21,096
to identify as Scene-stealer.

788
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:24,496
I have to put this up on a bulletin board at the end.

789
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,656
- Just let me do it. - We're competing after all.

790
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:28,866
Just let me do it.

791
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,726
- Will you leave after this? - Yes.

792
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:34,726
Gosh, why is this happening?

793
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:35,896
(She sees Kwang Soo's foot on their first date.)

794
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:36,956
Here you go.

795
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,026
Sign your name right here.

796
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:40,126
(You might as well sign your name.)

797
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:41,956
- Gosh. - The toast is ready.

798
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,926
(Didn't Jae Seok say he'll leave when the food is served?)

799
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:50,256
That looks delicious.

800
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:53,456
That looks amazing.

801
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:54,596
It looks very delicious.

802
00:34:56,696 --> 00:35:00,326
(He runs away quickly with a shoe in his hand.)

803
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:01,426
What's going on?

804
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:03,496
He ran away.

805
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:04,596
What?

806
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:06,056
(My shoe)

807
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:08,426
- He ran away. - Gosh.

808
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:09,456
He's a thief.

809
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,366
He's a thief. Catch him.

810
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:14,366
He's a real thief.

811
00:35:15,256 --> 00:35:16,296
He's a real thief.

812
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:20,056
(A real scene-stealer appears.)

813
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:21,096
Catch him.

814
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,156
He's a real thief.

815
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,026
(It's a real thief.)

816
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,096
(Jae Seok runs without looking back.)

817
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:36,826
(Did he follow me all day just to get my shoe?)

818
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:40,126
(Suddenly, he's left without his shoe.)

819
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,926
Goodness.

820
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:45,956
That was amazing.

821
00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:48,756
When did he steal the shoe?

822
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:52,156
I'm definitely the third wheel on their date.

823
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,126
(It's a date between two strange men.)

824
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,196
This isn't a date.

825
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:58,656
I feel like he dumped me on our first date.

826
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:01,496
Gosh.

827
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:03,226
That was close.

828
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:05,096
That was close.

829
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,296
(Why did Jae Seok steal Kwang Soo's shoe?)

830
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,596
He has such large feet.

831
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,656
I have to decide between the two.

832
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:13,956
How about this?

833
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:17,526
"James Bond mission is finding as many members as possible..."

834
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:20,626
"and steal a shoe from them no matter what."

835
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:22,096
Stealer of shoes.

836
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,896
(He's assigned as a stealer of shoes.)

837
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:28,526
(Who knew they meant shoes?)

838
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,866
It's delicious.

839
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:32,426
(What does Scene-stealer gain when he steals a shoe?)

840
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:34,596
Gosh, Jae Seok.

841
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,866
Gosh.

842
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,696
(They say your shoes can be easily stolen in Seoul.)

843
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,456
What is this?

844
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,456
What just happened?

845
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,096
What's this?

846
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,056
Urgent news.

847
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:50,366
"You lost a shoe to Scene-stealer and 10 percent of your views."

848
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,526
"When the mission's over, you get a hint to recover your views."

849
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:55,596
(If you lose a shoe, Scene-stealer takes 10 percent of the views.)

850
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:56,696
He's Scene-stealer.

851
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:00,896
Do I get a chance to recover it?

852
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:02,056
When the mission is over.

853
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,726
(He still has the other shoe.)

854
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:05,396
I need to meet other people.

855
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:07,956
I'm sorry, Seung Hyun.

856
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:10,256
I'm not someone without manners.

857
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:11,956
You didn't find your shoe?

858
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:13,456
He stole it and ran away.

859
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:15,056
That was his mission. What do I do?

860
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:16,996
(It may be rude to continue their date like this.)

861
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,026
What's your shoe size?

862
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:20,126
(By the way, what's your shoe size?)

863
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:21,196
Do you have money?

864
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,226
I need money to buy shoes.

865
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,456
Do you know anyone whose ideal type is me?

866
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:27,456
I'm sorry.

867
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:28,496
I think our date is a flop.

868
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,426
I'm sorry, Seung Hyun, but I'm going to eat.

869
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:34,396
(He eats a lot at the end of their horrible date.)

870
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,396
You must fill your stomach for the next date.

871
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,126
(What is on Seung Hyun's mind?)

872
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,296
(Is Kwang Soo still her ideal type?)

873
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:45,456
(They'll use lie detector to find out what's on her mind.)

874
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:46,726
(Kwang Soo will ask her three questions.)

875
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:47,796
You can start now.

876
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:50,056
(If she says yes to all and it's true, Kwang Soo is her ideal type.)

877
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,196
I am willing...

878
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:55,096
to have another date...

879
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,996
- with Kwang Soo again. - Yes.

880
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:01,196
(Her answer is yes.)

881
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,926
I couldn't show you my real charms today.

882
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,826
(Let's see if she answered truth.)

883
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,956
I really...

884
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:10,826
(This sound means she lied.)

885
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,996
(But she looks fine.)

886
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:15,456
(Didn't she get the electric shock?)

887
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,726
I don't feel anything.

888
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,696
- Earlier, it worked. - It says you're lying.

889
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,956
(The detector says Seung Hyun is telling a lie.)

890
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:24,026
(Then, we'll regard it as the truth.)

891
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:25,496
Since she didn't feel anything.

892
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,196
You heard the sound.

893
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:28,896
Isn't she pretending?

894
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:33,496
- No, I'm not. - I don't think that's possible.

895
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:35,026
I found it hard to pretend.

896
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:38,026
(He tested the detector 30 minutes ago.)

897
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,726
- Are you the most handsome member? - Yes.

898
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:40,956
(He said yes.)

899
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:43,196
I'm serious. Who do you think is more handsome than me?

900
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,056
Seriously...

901
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,926
(He's shocked.)

902
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,996
You all heard the alarming sound...

903
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,126
as if a disaster occurred, right?

904
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:00,296
Next question, please.

905
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,396
(Did she really tell the truth or did she fake it?)

906
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,296
If you have to go to a desert island...

907
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,326
with one of Running Man members, will you choose Kwang Soo?

908
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:09,366
Yes.

909
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:11,526
(She's willing to go to a desert island with him.)

910
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,926
I'm sure she said the truth, since she said this earlier.

911
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:15,126
(He seems confident.)

912
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:17,156
(Let's see.)

913
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,726
(What?)

914
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:27,596
(Does it really not hurt?)

915
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,396
Her hand is trembling.

916
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:33,096
I really don't feel anything. Why are you so doubtful?

917
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:35,656
If I seriously ask you out...

918
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:37,926
Your question is so...

919
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:39,326
Will you say yes?

920
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:40,496
(He asks if she will go out with him.)

921
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:41,526
Yes.

922
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:44,926
This is the most important question.

923
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:49,626
(Is Kwang Soo really her ideal type or nothing more than a weirdo?)

924
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:52,126
What if it says... Gosh, it hurts.

925
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:53,696
Gosh, it hurts.

926
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:55,496
Gosh, it hurts.

927
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,456
(What is that?)

928
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:59,256
(That was a pure lie.)

929
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:00,526
Are you playing with me?

930
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,956
I tried to help you.

931
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:06,596
I endured the pain twice.

932
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:10,626
(Now I am trying to hold back my anger.)

933
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,326
You don't have to say that.

934
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:15,496
Am I not your ideal type? Was I your ideal type in the past?

935
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,866
You used to be.

936
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:20,426
(I wish I could go back in time.)

937
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,956
(I thought Kwang Soo was my ideal type in the past.)

938
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:26,096
(It turned out that Kwang Soo is no longer Seung Hyun's ideal type.)

939
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:29,296
Haha is in Cheongdam-dong now.

940
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:33,096
Jong Kook is in Apgujeong-dong. He must be working out again.

941
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:36,156
Everyone, this is the gym I go to.

942
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:39,396
(He arrives at the gym to start working out.)

943
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,426
Who is it?

944
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,596
(He doesn't look familiar.)

945
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:45,456
Who is it?

946
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:51,366
(Who are you?)

947
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:54,396
Goodness.

948
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:57,396
(Who will be Jong Kook's partner today and exercise together?)

949
00:40:57,626 --> 00:40:58,756
It's nice to see you!

950
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:00,656
(He is...)

951
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:03,756
(Sleepy of Untouchable.)

952
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:07,826
(He's a charismatic hip-hop singer with 8 years of experience.)

953
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:10,526
(He's Korea's famous weakling.)

954
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:11,526
Let's do it later.

955
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,456
I can't do this.

956
00:41:13,456 --> 00:41:16,656
(This weakling joins Running Man!)

957
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,626
People think you're very weak.

958
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:22,866
Let's show them that you're not weak.

959
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:25,296
- Show them how strong you are. - I'm trying to bulk up these days.

960
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:26,956
(I'm actually working on it.)

961
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:28,156
(You must be joking.)

962
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,956
- Are you? - I gained 10kg.

963
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:32,226
Are you serious? Why are you still so skinny?

964
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:33,456
Why are you still so skinny?

965
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:34,866
(He daringly exposes his belly.)

966
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:36,326
What was that?

967
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,396
I want to be muscular. Next year,

968
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:42,826
I want to get married... No. I want to perform without a shirt on.

969
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:44,726
(What did you say?)

970
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:46,326
- That didn't come out right. - Get married?

971
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,326
I want to perform like that.

972
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:50,526
Right. When rappers perform without a shirt on,

973
00:41:50,596 --> 00:41:53,126
it is so cool. You must try it, too.

974
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,156
I hope so.

975
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:58,096
Then, let's analyse your body composition first.

976
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:02,326
(This is essential to find appropriate exercise for him.)

977
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:03,526
It's coming out.

978
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:04,626
(Let's see how healthy Jong Kook is.)

979
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:08,126
I have 42.1kg of skeletal muscles.

980
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,796
I weigh 79.2kg and have 6.3kg of body fat.

981
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,626
You have about 6kg of fat?

982
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:16,596
- Right. - Then, do your muscles weigh 73kg?

983
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:19,126
(Do your muscles weigh 73kg?)

984
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:20,526
(He's not a crustacean.)

985
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:22,056
- I also have bones. - Oh, bones.

986
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:24,126
Of course, the rest aren't muscles.

987
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,956
(It's Sleepy's turn.)

988
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,126
Okay.

989
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:28,996
It's coming out.

990
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:31,626
You have 14.8kg of muscles...

991
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:33,526
and 16.6kg of body fat.

992
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:34,726
(His body fat weighs 16.6kg.)

993
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,126
How can you have this much fat? You look so skinny.

994
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:40,156
- I'm thin but obese. - Really?

995
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,326
People call me E.T.

996
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,726
(He's an E.T-like hip-hop singer.)

997
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,726
You have 10kg of fat more than me.

998
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:47,526
Your body fat weighs 10kg heavier than mine.

999
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:50,866
- I really want to work out. - Let's begin with the basics.

1000
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:52,496
Let's do push-ups first.

1001
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:53,866
- Relax your shoulders. - I'm good at this.

1002
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,296
This is for warming up.

1003
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:56,526
Do as many times as you can.

1004
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:01,396
Wait, get up.

1005
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,996
Wait, get up.

1006
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:04,496
You must straighten your body.

1007
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:08,296
You should straighten your body. Keep the posture.

1008
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:09,866
Ready, go!

1009
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:11,626
(Ready, go!)

1010
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,196
- One. - It's too painful.

1011
00:43:13,196 --> 00:43:15,366
- It's too painful. - Already?

1012
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,596
Where do you feel painful?

1013
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:19,796
- Where? - My back.

1014
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:20,956
Does your back hurt?

1015
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:23,056
This is a chest exercise. Why does your back hurt?

1016
00:43:23,096 --> 00:43:24,526
Do it again. Go!

1017
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:26,126
Good.

1018
00:43:26,926 --> 00:43:28,456
Two more. Go!

1019
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:30,956
Great. Keep it up!

1020
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:34,056
That's it. You did well.

1021
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:37,156
(A deep sigh)

1022
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,896
You already look tired. Lie down, then.

1023
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:41,596
(He's totally exhausted.)

1024
00:43:41,596 --> 00:43:44,596
- Can I take a break? - You can't.

1025
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:45,896
Start!

1026
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:47,656
(It's time for bench press.)

1027
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,056
Go!

1028
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:51,996
It's a piece of cake.

1029
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:54,526
(It's a piece of cake.)

1030
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:57,226
(His arms are shaking.)

1031
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:59,056
- Gosh. - One more.

1032
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:01,996
(He's on vibration mode.)

1033
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,756
(He screams.)

1034
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:05,526
(He finishes his chest workout.)

1035
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:06,596
Get up.

1036
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:08,256
Get up at once.

1037
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,656
(It's time for back exercises.)

1038
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:11,656
Two!

1039
00:44:12,456 --> 00:44:13,926
- It's too heavy. - Good.

1040
00:44:14,926 --> 00:44:16,296
- Is it heavy? - Yes.

1041
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:18,396
- Please lower the weight. - Lower the weight?

1042
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:20,156
(His back exercise is over.)

1043
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:22,096
That's it. Push it! Good.

1044
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:24,726
- Two more to go. - I think it's too heavy for me.

1045
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:27,426
No, it's not. Even women can bear this weight.

1046
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:29,756
(I miss my mum.)

1047
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:31,356
- Isn't it too harsh? - No.

1048
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:32,696
You must enjoy it. It's so fun.

1049
00:44:32,696 --> 00:44:34,596
- It's so fun. - It is fun.

1050
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:37,356
Picture how you'd look after working out.

1051
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:40,296
- My name will be on top search. - That's right.

1052
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:42,596
- I can't do it any more. - You must.

1053
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:46,056
- Gosh. - Jong Kook, I really can't.

1054
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,726
- Three more to go. - I'm serious.

1055
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,956
One, two...

1056
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:53,356
and three. Good job.

1057
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:55,226
(He moans in pain.)

1058
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:58,656
I helped a lot of celebrities with their work out.

1059
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:00,456
I recently helped Park Bo Gum.

1060
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,296
- He's a superstar. - I taught him how to work out.

1061
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:03,956
I just taught you the way Bo Gum works out.

1062
00:45:03,956 --> 00:45:05,596
- Really? - Yes.

1063
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:07,496
(He seems to come to his senses again.)

1064
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:09,596
I taught Bo Gum the same exercises.

1065
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:11,696
You're doing exactly what he did.

1066
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:13,856
- Can I become Park Bo Gum, then? - Of course.

1067
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:20,456
(I wish I can be like Park Bo Gum.)

1068
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:21,796
Bo Gum works out the same way.

1069
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:23,496
- Park Bo Gum! - Good.

1070
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:24,796
- Park Bo Gum. - Park Bo Gum.

1071
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:26,456
- Good. - I can't do it.

1072
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:28,526
No way. Keep it up.

1073
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,656
Great! Just one more set.

1074
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:34,456
Let's do it for the last time. In 1, 2, 3.

1075
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,256
Park Bo Gum!

1076
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:38,356
Park Bo Gum.

1077
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:40,356
(Running Man's Space Out Contest)

1078
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:41,596
What is that?

1079
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,796
(Scene-stealer Jae Seok arrives at Han River.)

1080
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:46,126
What is Ji Hyo doing?

1081
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,196
(He wants only one thing.)

1082
00:45:53,056 --> 00:45:54,196
Crush!

1083
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,456
I see why you won the competition before.

1084
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:58,856
(Jae Seok tries to distract Crush.)

1085
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,326
My goodness.

1086
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:02,526
He doesn't even move his eyes.

1087
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,456
He's amazing.

1088
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:06,296
(Where are my shoes?)

1089
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,956
(Why is he here?)

1090
00:46:08,956 --> 00:46:10,296
(She stares at Jae Seok.)

1091
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,856
(He's intimidated.)

1092
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:14,156
Why do you move your body?

1093
00:46:14,156 --> 00:46:16,526
If you move your body, you'll lose the contest.

1094
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:20,326
(Go away.)

1095
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,696
If you speak, you'll lose.

1096
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,396
(He tries to annoy Ji Hyo, saying she'll lose if she moves.)

1097
00:46:24,396 --> 00:46:26,326
Crush won the contest before.

1098
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,056
What is that? What is he doing?

1099
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:30,956
What is that for?

1100
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:35,326
(It's a good chance for Jae Seok since they should stay calm.)

1101
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:36,796
It's amazing.

1102
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,796
(It's a good chance for Jae Seok since they should stay calm.)

1103
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:39,996
What's her heart rate?

1104
00:46:40,826 --> 00:46:42,426
(He moves Ji Hyo's shoes.)

1105
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:44,896
Did you say it's 14?

1106
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:47,056
(This is very thrilling.)

1107
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:48,126
How can you...

1108
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:49,826
My goodness.

1109
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:52,996
Crush doesn't even smile.

1110
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:55,156
(He has nothing on his mind.)

1111
00:46:55,856 --> 00:47:00,126
(Ji Hyo is writing to Jae Seok to leave her alone and go.)

1112
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:01,696
Okay.

1113
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:06,426
(The longer he stays here, the more they'll find him suspicious.)

1114
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:13,226
(Finally, he jumps into action.)

1115
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:16,426
Goodbye, Crush.

1116
00:47:18,196 --> 00:47:25,996
(Ji Hyo looks back!)

1117
00:47:25,996 --> 00:47:27,356
Goodbye, Crush.

1118
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:29,896
(But she can't see the shoe from here.)

1119
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:34,526
(Her shoe is gone.)

1120
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:40,126
(Scene-stealer Jae Seok gets away with this.)

1121
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:42,296
That was really easy.

1122
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:45,396
It was a piece of cake this time.

1123
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,596
(She is dazed.)

1124
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:51,656
She doesn't even realise her shoe is gone.

1125
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:54,426
I got it very easily.

1126
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,126
Who comes next?

1127
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:00,656
Jong Kook is near here,

1128
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,696
but he is not easy to deal with.

1129
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:09,056
Then I should call Min Hyo Rin's agent.

1130
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:11,956
(The first one Seok Jin picked for Cinderella's nose is Min Hyo Rin?)

1131
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,296
- Hello. - Hello. Mr Ko.

1132
00:48:14,296 --> 00:48:16,196
I'm Ji Seok Jin from Running Man.

1133
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:18,296
Oh, hi. How are you?

1134
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:24,056
I didn't make an appointment but I'd like to meet Hyo Rin now.

1135
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:27,396
She is in Japan for shooting for a magazine.

1136
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,596
- Is she in Japan? - Yes.

1137
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:32,496
Oh, I see. Okay, then.

1138
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,496
I'll try Gaeko then.

1139
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,796
The number you have dialled is in roaming area...

1140
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:40,726
- He is overseas now. - You'll be charged after the beep.

1141
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:42,196
Next is Zico.

1142
00:48:42,196 --> 00:48:48,926
(You were my pick from start, Zico.)

1143
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,326
- The number you have dialled... - It's not going through.

1144
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:54,596
I'll meet somebody after all.

1145
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:57,796
(Starting is important, but he's having a trouble from the start.)

1146
00:48:57,796 --> 00:49:00,256
Who was that? There was a celebrity van.

1147
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:01,626
Why don't you check it out?

1148
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:03,956
Shall I stop the van and check it out?

1149
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,956
Would you get closer to the left side of the van?

1150
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:09,596
Roll down the window please.

1151
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:13,096
(He's looking for Cinderella's nose in the street.)

1152
00:49:13,096 --> 00:49:14,196
This is embarrassing.

1153
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,356
Excuse me. Go a bit closer.

1154
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,396
Hello, I'm Ji Seok Jin.

1155
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:21,996
Is this a celebrity van?

1156
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:23,626
- Whose van is it? - Who's in there?

1157
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,196
I'm shooting Running Man. Whose van is it?

1158
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:29,496
(I met you on Seongsu Bridge but who are you?)

1159
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:33,196
It's Park Si Yeon's.

1160
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:36,396
I'd like to meet Park Si Yeon! Is she in there?

1161
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:37,596
Let me pull off the van.

1162
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:38,796
Great. Thank you.

1163
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:42,756
So we happened to meet Park Si Yeon like this.

1164
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:46,426
I got a chance to meet Park Si Yeon in the street.

1165
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:49,126
(He is so excited to see her.)

1166
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:51,296
I can't believe I can meet her.

1167
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:55,056
Is it really Park Si Yeon?

1168
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,396
Hello.

1169
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:57,756
Is this Park Si Yeon's van?

1170
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:59,896
(She looks so surprised.)

1171
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,896
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

1172
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,926
Hello, Si Yeon. I'm sorry to stop you.

1173
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:06,056
- I'm surprised. - Me too.

1174
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,396
I was on the way to a salon.

1175
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:09,196
You were.

1176
00:50:09,196 --> 00:50:12,796
- Sorry I suddenly stopped you. - That's okay. I'm nervous.

1177
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:16,456
I'm nervous too, and I'm sorry for being rude.

1178
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:19,696
I need to find someone who has a nose that matches this one.

1179
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:23,096
May I check your nose?

1180
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:24,756
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

1181
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,496
- Let's check. - What if it matches?

1182
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:30,596
It's like Cinderella's glass slippers,

1183
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:32,456
but now we're looking for Cinderella who has a matching nose.

1184
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,696
I'll put this on your nose and see if it fits you.

1185
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:39,756
(He just bumped into Si Yeon.)

1186
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:43,696
(Can she be Cinderella he was looking for?)

1187
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:46,696
I think it fits you. Wait.

1188
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:49,696
No, the shape of the lips is different.

1189
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:54,256
(This is embarrassing.)

1190
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:57,626
Sorry to make you have all the trouble.

1191
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:59,096
- I apologise. - No problem.

1192
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:02,696
- I'll invite you as a guest. - Okay. That sounds good.

1193
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:05,796
- I really appreciate it. - Okay. Goodbye.

1194
00:51:05,926 --> 00:51:07,396
- Bye. - Thank you.

1195
00:51:07,396 --> 00:51:09,296
I really appreciate it.

1196
00:51:09,656 --> 00:51:13,056
I'm so grateful to Si Yeon.

1197
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:17,426
I think we can see a lot of celebrities at salons.

1198
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:19,456
Let's go to salons. Is it okay?

1199
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:23,996
And our goal today is to catch all the celebrity vans.

1200
00:51:24,096 --> 00:51:25,596
Catch all the vans and let's go to salons.

1201
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:30,096
I believe we can bump into the person with this nose.

1202
00:51:30,096 --> 00:51:31,326
Is this a celebrity van?

1203
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:33,526
Who is it? Lim Ji Yeon?

1204
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:35,426
- Hello, Seok Jin. - Hi.

1205
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,526
Good to see you here.

1206
00:51:37,526 --> 00:51:40,196
My mission is to find the person that has this nose.

1207
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:42,826
- May I try it on your nose? - Really?

1208
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:45,296
- It's too big. - I think it's big.

1209
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:47,496
It's big, isn't it? There is room inside.

1210
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:51,056
- Don't press it too hard. - I didn't mean to.

1211
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:52,496
It hurts.

1212
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:53,496
I'm sorry.

1213
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:56,226
- Thank you for the interview. - No problem.

1214
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:58,856
- Goodbye. Thank you. - Thank you.

1215
00:51:59,226 --> 00:52:00,826
There are many celebrities in this neighbourhood.

1216
00:52:01,196 --> 00:52:02,626
The number looks like that of a rental car.

1217
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:05,396
And the windows are tinted.

1218
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:06,956
- Hello. - Would you like to get out?

1219
00:52:07,026 --> 00:52:09,296
Give me the nose.

1220
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:10,726
Whose nose do you think it is?

1221
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,396
- This one? - Wait.

1222
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:14,656
- Is it yours? - No, it's not.

1223
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,426
(Kim So Hee tries on the nose.)

1224
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:18,756
No. This is too big for you.

1225
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:21,426
Wait. Excuse me.

1226
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:23,196
(He goes for the van behind.)

1227
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:25,496
Seung Yeon of Kara?

1228
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:27,126
May I go with you?

1229
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:28,496
I'll get to meet Han Seung Yeon.

1230
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:30,396
(He goes to a salon where Seung Yeon is.)

1231
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:33,126
Seung Yeon. Where is she? Seung Yeon.

1232
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:35,356
- Don't record this. - Please help me.

1233
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:38,696
- It's okay. You're pretty enough. - It's been a while.

1234
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:40,726
- This is incredible. - Let's see if it matches.

1235
00:52:41,026 --> 00:52:42,696
- Put it on your nose. - There is something in here.

1236
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:43,896
No, it's clean.

1237
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:46,226
(Seung Yeon is the fourth candidate.)

1238
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:48,926
No, you're not the one. The lips are...

1239
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:50,496
located very low.

1240
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:52,596
- I think this belongs... - To a man?

1241
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:54,056
Yes, I think so.

1242
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,126
(Is this a nose of a man?)

1243
00:52:57,396 --> 00:53:00,996
I think Seok Jin is too excited now.

1244
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:04,126
I think I need to let him calm down a little bit.

1245
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:06,896
There he is.

1246
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:12,396
(What kind of strategy should I use for Seok Jin?)

1247
00:53:13,226 --> 00:53:14,296
Who is it?

1248
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:16,956
(He's still trying hard to check the vans.)

1249
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,696
(Jae Seok is running.)

1250
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,826
Who's in there?

1251
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:22,596
- Excuse me? - April.

1252
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:25,026
- April. It's a new girl group. - Yes.

1253
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:26,156
Are they all in?

1254
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:27,326
(While Seok Jin is distracted by the girl group,)

1255
00:53:27,326 --> 00:53:28,396
(Jae Seok is planning the operation.)

1256
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:30,926
Please hold Seok Jin.

1257
00:53:31,396 --> 00:53:33,196
Why are you here?

1258
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:36,356
- What were you doing? - What about you?

1259
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:39,956
I'm looking for a matching nose. It's nonsense.

1260
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:42,626
I'm looking for the person whose nose is matching with this one.

1261
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:43,626
What is this?

1262
00:53:44,026 --> 00:53:45,296
The person... What are you doing?

1263
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:46,656
(They hold him tight.)

1264
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:49,356
What are you doing, Jae Seok?

1265
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,096
(What do you think I'm doing?)

1266
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:54,096
(I need your shoe.)

1267
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:55,896
Hey, wait up.

1268
00:53:55,896 --> 00:53:58,226
(What a brat.)

1269
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:00,126
What's wrong with him?

1270
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:01,156
(Laughing)

1271
00:54:01,596 --> 00:54:02,696
What's wrong with him?

1272
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:07,096
(What a robber you are.)

1273
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:09,496
(Jae Seok is fast.)

1274
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,026
- Jae Seok. - Go, go. Just go.

1275
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:13,156
(He slams the door.)

1276
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:15,396
- Hey. - You can go.

1277
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:17,896
How could you? Are you crazy?

1278
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:20,996
Jae Seok. He must be crazy.

1279
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:25,156
(Bye, Seok Jin.)

1280
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,926
You can just leave.

1281
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:30,726
Is he out of his mind?

1282
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:33,526
Gosh.

1283
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:35,296
(Why did you steal my shoe?)

1284
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:36,856
I don't know what to say.

1285
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:39,156
I'm at a loss for words.

1286
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:41,156
He must be Scene-stealer.

1287
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,456
He is Scene-stealer.

1288
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:46,396
"He gets 10 percent of your final viewership."

1289
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,026
(If he steals a shoe, he'll get 10 percent of the viewership.)

1290
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:49,896
After the mission, you have a chance to get it back.

1291
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:52,396
Let's go, anyway.

1292
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,856
I need to borrow some slippers in the salon.

1293
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:58,926
I can't walk around without a shoe.

1294
00:54:58,926 --> 00:55:02,056
(I'll take revenge on you for sure.)

1295
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:04,026
(What's the main dish of Haha and Mark?)

1296
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:05,426
What else do we have to do?

1297
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:07,156
Now,

1298
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:09,796
let's make the main dish of our own.

1299
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:12,396
(What's the main dish of their own?)

1300
00:55:12,496 --> 00:55:16,326
Let's combine my recipe your recipe together.

1301
00:55:16,456 --> 00:55:19,926
Instead of the sausage, let's add a hamburger steak.

1302
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:21,956
- A hamburger steak? - Yes, an instant hamburger steak.

1303
00:55:22,096 --> 00:55:23,796
Let's put it instead of sausage.

1304
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,696
I think it must be delicious.

1305
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:29,526
(Cook tteokbokki and instant spaghetti and mix them.)

1306
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,196
(Pour some mozzarella cheese.)

1307
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,856
(Put a hamburger steak on it and top it with more cheese.)

1308
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,796
(Lastly, microwave it and it's done.)

1309
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:42,526
This looks so good.

1310
00:55:43,696 --> 00:55:46,496
We're really making a dish with foods from convenience stores.

1311
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:49,856
(To make a dessert, put bananas around a cream puff.)

1312
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:53,396
(Drizzle melted chocolate and top it with green tea ice cream.)

1313
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:55,396
(It looks great. Please order in now.)

1314
00:55:56,696 --> 00:55:58,026
You need just two ingredients for this.

1315
00:55:58,296 --> 00:56:01,196
All you need is chocolate chip cookies and banana milk.

1316
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:04,356
Eat it in five seconds after you pour the milk.

1317
00:56:04,396 --> 00:56:05,796
- Nice. - Time's up.

1318
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:09,596
I think we have a great teamwork.

1319
00:56:09,656 --> 00:56:11,456
- We're fast. - Let's cheer.

1320
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:14,856
(They try to show their muscles to raise the viewership.)

1321
00:56:14,856 --> 00:56:19,056
(Please click a lot on Haha's broadcast.)

1322
00:56:20,056 --> 00:56:21,596
I hope the result will be good.

1323
00:56:21,596 --> 00:56:23,396
(Here is a full course meal made with instant foods.)

1324
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:27,896
(An appetiser topped with crab meat, curry udon...)

1325
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:31,126
(and the main dish of their own.)

1326
00:56:31,196 --> 00:56:34,026
(They created dishes on a whole new level with instant foods.)

1327
00:56:34,196 --> 00:56:35,656
Here is someone who can help you.

1328
00:56:37,056 --> 00:56:40,096
(Is there someone who will help Haha's cooking show?)

1329
00:56:41,456 --> 00:56:42,596
Oh, it's Chan Sung.

1330
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:43,796
(Here is Chan Sung of 2PM.)

1331
00:56:43,796 --> 00:56:44,926
- Chan Sung. - Hello.

1332
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:46,656
- Hello. - What is all this?

1333
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:49,126
You came here. Congratulations on your comeback.

1334
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:50,856
(He showed up on Haha's show before a music show.)

1335
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:54,426
I saw him in the restroom.

1336
00:56:54,426 --> 00:56:55,996
I was wondering why he was here.

1337
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,456
This is my agency.

1338
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:59,256
Oh, this is your agency.

1339
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:01,626
- I'm sorry. Now... - Okay.

1340
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:03,496
- Guys. - What's all this? They look weird.

1341
00:57:03,496 --> 00:57:04,496
What are you guys doing?

1342
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:06,656
- Take this off. - Take it off.

1343
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:08,396
(Haha tries to reveal Chan Sung's muscles, too.)

1344
00:57:08,396 --> 00:57:09,526
We should take it off here.

1345
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,596
Since when did Running Man become like this?

1346
00:57:11,656 --> 00:57:12,796
What are you doing?

1347
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,296
- Roll it up. - Why are you doing this to me?

1348
00:57:15,296 --> 00:57:17,126
It's for the viewership.

1349
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,796
- No, it's okay. - Come on.

1350
00:57:18,996 --> 00:57:20,526
(Breaking news! Chan Sung shows his muscles on Haha's show.)

1351
00:57:20,526 --> 00:57:23,396
- Please do it like this. - Please don't.

1352
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:25,496
- You have great muscles. - I'm puzzled.

1353
00:57:25,756 --> 00:57:27,096
- Great. - I give up.

1354
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:30,856
The hot guy in 2PM...

1355
00:57:30,856 --> 00:57:32,156
(At that moment, Seok Jin enters the room.)

1356
00:57:32,526 --> 00:57:34,026
(What is Seok Jin doing here?)

1357
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:35,526
- Hello. - Hello.

1358
00:57:35,526 --> 00:57:37,396
(What brings Seok Jin to Haha's cooking show set?)

1359
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:40,496
Gosh, Jae Seok is such a rascal.

1360
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:43,456
How do I find the person with this nose?

1361
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:46,356
How far do I have to go?

1362
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:48,356
It's impossible to find the person.

1363
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:50,856
How do I find the person with this nose?

1364
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:51,996
Goodness.

1365
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:55,726
I need a hint. It's so unfair compared to other members.

1366
00:57:55,896 --> 00:57:58,626
Give me a hint such as the location of this person.

1367
00:57:58,626 --> 00:58:01,896
Tell me which neighbourhood I should go.

1368
00:58:01,926 --> 00:58:03,796
Otherwise, I can't do it.

1369
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:05,796
How do I find the person? Think about it.

1370
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:08,826
Where would I find them with just a copy of their nose?

1371
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:12,956
Considering your mission is more difficult compared to others',

1372
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:15,256
we'll give you a small hint.

1373
00:58:15,256 --> 00:58:16,526
Give me a big hint instead.

1374
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,256
What's the hint?

1375
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:23,456
The person with this nose is an idol member...

1376
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:26,996
who works for either SM, YG or JYP Entertainment.

1377
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:28,596
(It's an idol group member at 1 of the 3 agencies.)

1378
00:58:28,596 --> 00:58:30,926
- It's one of the idol members? - Yes.

1379
00:58:31,656 --> 00:58:33,126
Big nose idol.

1380
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:35,526
(He searches "Big nose idol" online.)

1381
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:37,196
Big nose...

1382
00:58:38,196 --> 00:58:39,756
There's information on big nose idol.

1383
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:41,356
(Which idol member did he find?)

1384
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:43,696
He's a big nose idol member.

1385
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:44,756
Look at this.

1386
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:46,826
(Chan Sung of 2PM is the top suspect.)

1387
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:49,396
It's Chan Sung of 2PM. He works for JYP Entertainment.

1388
00:58:49,956 --> 00:58:51,226
Let's go.

1389
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,356
- Seok Jin. - I'm exhausted.

1390
00:58:55,526 --> 00:58:57,126
- I don't want to talk any more. - Don't do it.

1391
00:58:57,126 --> 00:58:58,456
Come here, Chan Sung.

1392
00:58:58,456 --> 00:58:59,626
Don't go near him.

1393
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:00,626
Come here.

1394
00:59:00,626 --> 00:59:03,726
Looking for the person has been exhausting. Come here.

1395
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:06,296
- Leave now, Chan Sung. - It's you, isn't it?

1396
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:09,056
- Right? It's you. - Hurry up and leave.

1397
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:10,696
Wait a minute.

1398
00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:12,756
(Where are you going?)

1399
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:14,726
- Seok Jin, I have to go. - Wait a minute.

1400
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,626
Wait, let me take a look.

1401
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:17,956
- Really? - Isn't it his nose? Look.

1402
00:59:17,956 --> 00:59:20,496
The nostrils look different from his.

1403
00:59:20,826 --> 00:59:22,526
It's definitely his nose.

1404
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:26,726
(It was neither Park Si Yeon, Han Seung Yeon nor Lim Ji Yeon.)

1405
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:30,896
(Is Chan Sung the person with the nose he's been looking for?)

1406
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:32,696
(It fits perfectly.)

1407
00:59:34,026 --> 00:59:37,126
(What? It fits perfectly.)

1408
00:59:37,526 --> 00:59:38,726
I can't breathe.

1409
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,326
Seok Jin, you completed the mission successfully.

1410
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:43,226
(The big nose is Chan Sung's.)

1411
00:59:43,226 --> 00:59:44,356
Really?

1412
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:46,456
(The big nose is Chan Sung's.)

1413
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:49,296
(He finally succeeds in finding Cinderella's nose.)

1414
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:51,326
I had no idea that it was you.

1415
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:53,096
(Seok Jin finds another big-nosed person in Seoul.)

1416
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:55,026
I wondered how you would find me.

1417
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,996
- This is incredible. - I was really curious.

1418
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,726
We have another mission for you.

1419
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:00,056
We have another mission for you.

1420
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,926
Both of you completed your mission, so we give it to you simultaneously.

1421
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:04,856
- At the same time? - Here's your mission.

1422
01:00:05,626 --> 01:00:08,396
Scene-stealer is James Bond.

1423
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,226
(James Bond?)

1424
01:00:10,226 --> 01:00:13,696
Eliminate James Bond who stole your number of views and your shoe.

1425
01:00:13,696 --> 01:00:14,926
(Eliminate James Bond who stole your views and your shoe.)

1426
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:16,826
(What's this?)

1427
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:18,056
This looks amazing.

1428
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:20,156
It looks so delicious. Wait a minute.

1429
01:00:20,226 --> 01:00:21,526
He's a thief.

1430
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:23,626
(He ran away with Kwang Soo's shoe without a reason.)

1431
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:26,656
(He stole Ji Hyo's shoe.)

1432
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,496
That was so easy.

1433
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:30,356
What are you doing?

1434
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:31,896
What's wrong with him?

1435
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:32,926
(He stole Seok Jin's shoe in the middle of the street.)

1436
01:00:32,926 --> 01:00:34,056
Hey.

1437
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:36,756
Jae Seok, have you lost your mind?

1438
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:38,326
(James Bond's intention was to steal their views.)

1439
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:42,596
(James Bond is back.)

1440
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:45,326
What does it mean?

1441
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:47,356
I'm about to lose my mind right now.

1442
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:50,026
Should we eliminate him by taking off his name tag?

1443
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:53,426
- How do we know where he is? - You'll get a GPS.

1444
01:00:53,426 --> 01:00:55,756
- This will determine the winner. - Do we have to look for him?

1445
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:57,296
I'm tired of looking for people.

1446
01:00:57,796 --> 01:00:59,296
(The person who takes off Jae Seok's name tag gets all his views.)

1447
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,626
This is the end of Running Man Space Out Contest.

1448
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:07,156
Jae Seok took one of my shoes.

1449
01:01:07,526 --> 01:01:10,196
Why did he take one of my shoes?

1450
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:13,226
I was happy to be a part of...

1451
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:16,396
the Space Out Contest between Ji Hyo and Crush.

1452
01:01:16,396 --> 01:01:19,256
Based on the overall performance,

1453
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:23,056
Crush is the winner of the Space Out Contest.

1454
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:24,826
He's a strong opponent.

1455
01:01:25,026 --> 01:01:27,296
You're a strong opponent. Congratulations.

1456
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:28,956
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1457
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:30,526
(The story of the Space Out Contest will be told on Ji Hyo TV.)

1458
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,126
What's this?

1459
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,326
The person who eliminates him takes all the views...

1460
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:37,026
he obtained from other members.

1461
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,796
(The person to eliminate Jae Seok will take all of his views.)

1462
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:42,826
He stole my shoe.

1463
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:43,956
Gosh.

1464
01:01:43,956 --> 01:01:44,956
(She's wearing two different shoes because of Scene-stealer.)

1465
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:47,796
I need to change my shoes.

1466
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:50,526
I can't run or walk in these.

1467
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:51,796
Shall I give you a piggyback?

1468
01:01:52,196 --> 01:01:53,896
May I borrow one of your feet?

1469
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:57,656
I'll follow your walking speed.

1470
01:01:57,656 --> 01:02:00,396
(Ji Hyo and Crush go to find Scene-stealer.)

1471
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:04,526
(Haha, Seok Jin and Ji Hyo start the chase.)

1472
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:11,256
(Kwang Soo walks carefully in two different shoes.)

1473
01:02:11,256 --> 01:02:13,126
Can I enter the salon looking like this?

1474
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:19,296
(He goes to meet her wearing two different shoes.)

1475
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:21,656
This is the place.

1476
01:02:24,256 --> 01:02:26,356
(Where's the woman that chose me?)

1477
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:28,296
I'm looking for a salon.

1478
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:36,056
(Who is the second woman to express her love for Kwang Soo?)

1479
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,456
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1480
01:02:38,456 --> 01:02:39,696
Hello.

1481
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:43,096
(Kwang Soo's second love is Song Ji Eun.)

1482
01:02:44,096 --> 01:02:45,696
By the way,

1483
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:48,056
it's embarrassing to say it myself,

1484
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:50,996
but I heard you said I'm your ideal type.

1485
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:52,456
(He asks such a direct question during their first meeting.)

1486
01:02:52,456 --> 01:02:54,956
Have you ever said that?

1487
01:02:55,226 --> 01:02:58,726
You've been my ideal type of men for seven years.

1488
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:00,726
(She's liked me for seven long years.)

1489
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:03,196
I was very surprised to hear from you.

1490
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,526
It feels like meeting...

1491
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:08,196
- a special celebrity in my heart. - Gosh.

1492
01:03:11,656 --> 01:03:12,826
I feel nervous.

1493
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,526
I've never been in such a situation before.

1494
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:17,456
It feels like meeting a special celebrity in my heart.

1495
01:03:17,456 --> 01:03:19,056
(They both feel very nervous.)

1496
01:03:19,326 --> 01:03:20,326
May I...

1497
01:03:21,026 --> 01:03:22,096
speak casually with you?

1498
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:24,156
Of course, go ahead.

1499
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,096
Is there anything you wanted to do on a date?

1500
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,626
I haven't been on many ordinary dates.

1501
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:33,396
I want to get my nails done...

1502
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:35,696
with my boyfriend...

1503
01:03:35,696 --> 01:03:38,326
and have a conversation. I like to do small things.

1504
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:41,096
I've never done that before with someone on a date.

1505
01:03:41,096 --> 01:03:42,996
- I haven't, either. - Really?

1506
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:44,896
(Shall we get our nails done?)

1507
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:46,096
That's why.

1508
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:47,796
(Shall we get our nails done?)

1509
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:53,096
(For their date, they get a nail treatment together.)

1510
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,296
I've never done this before,

1511
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:58,196
- so I don't know. - I'll set it up for you.

1512
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:00,456
I'll explain it to you.

1513
01:04:00,996 --> 01:04:02,256
What do men usually get?

1514
01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:06,356
Some get character designs that match their girlfriends'.

1515
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:07,656
- That sounds cute. - I see.

1516
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:10,226
(He checks her reaction.)

1517
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:12,696
May I get a character design?

1518
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,226
(He'd do anything she thinks is cute.)

1519
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:19,296
Which design shall I get? Can you choose one for me?

1520
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:23,796
- Let's get each other's initials. - Let's do that.

1521
01:04:23,996 --> 01:04:25,856
(He's startled by how quickly they're getting close.)

1522
01:04:25,856 --> 01:04:27,526
How are my hands?

1523
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:29,096
They're quite dirty.

1524
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:30,426
(They're quite dirty.)

1525
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:34,126
How could you say that when...

1526
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,626
A lot of people are interrupting my date today.

1527
01:04:39,396 --> 01:04:42,426
Your hands are much cleaner than I expected.

1528
01:04:42,896 --> 01:04:44,656
How dirty did you expect them to be?

1529
01:04:44,796 --> 01:04:47,356
(His hygiene level is much higher than she expected.)

1530
01:04:47,356 --> 01:04:49,626
What type of men do you dislike?

1531
01:04:50,026 --> 01:04:53,426
I'm asking because I want to be the best I can be to you.

1532
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:56,026
I don't like men who pry too much.

1533
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,056
- Someone who's nosy? - Right.

1534
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,696
Did I misunderstand?

1535
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:03,196
I think I heard you saying that you're the obsessive type on TV.

1536
01:05:03,726 --> 01:05:05,056
I heard you were the obsessive type.

1537
01:05:05,256 --> 01:05:07,056
Me?

1538
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:08,756
Who said such a lie?

1539
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:10,856
I'm not like that at all.

1540
01:05:11,656 --> 01:05:14,656
I've never been obsessed with anyone.

1541
01:05:15,696 --> 01:05:18,996
Where's Kwang Soo? He has ulterior motives right now.

1542
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:22,096
- Hello, Ji Hyo. - Hello.

1543
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:24,026
- Hello. - Hello.

1544
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:26,826
- Hello. - Congratulations, you won recently.

1545
01:05:26,826 --> 01:05:30,156
You don't have the luxury to relax and get a nail treatment.

1546
01:05:30,156 --> 01:05:32,726
- You don't have time right now. - What's going on?

1547
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:33,726
What's wrong?

1548
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,326
You're missing a shoe, Kwang Soo.

1549
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:38,526
He had mismatched shoes ever since I met him.

1550
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:40,656
You're missing a shoe.

1551
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:42,696
Kwang Soo.

1552
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,696
How can you be relaxed and get a nail treatment right now?

1553
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:49,196
I'm on a date.

1554
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:50,856
Is it finished?

1555
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:53,896
Thank you.

1556
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:56,956
(Her initials are engraved on his nail.)

1557
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:00,296
I've never done it before.

1558
01:06:00,796 --> 01:06:03,026
- That looks so cute. - That's so cute.

1559
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:05,326
(He smiles.)

1560
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:06,996
Do you like it, Kwang Soo?

1561
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,526
It's my first time doing this.

1562
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:11,356
Do you like it?

1563
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:12,956
(Now that they have a keepsake,)

1564
01:06:12,956 --> 01:06:17,226
(it's time to find out how each other feels.)

1565
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:21,526
Is your ideal type of men Kwang Soo?

1566
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:25,856
(Do your feelings for me remain the same since seven years ago?)

1567
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,896
Yes.

1568
01:06:28,796 --> 01:06:33,226
(Kwang Soo, do you feel my love?)

1569
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:36,826
(What are Ji Eun's feelings for Kwang Soo?)

1570
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:43,856
(Her feelings for him haven't changed.)

1571
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:46,096
This is so boring.

1572
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:49,526
(Ji Hyo suddenly asks Ji Eun a question.)

1573
01:06:49,526 --> 01:06:52,956
While observing Kwang Soo today,

1574
01:06:52,996 --> 01:06:55,356
were you disappointed in him at all?

1575
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,196
No.

1576
01:06:58,026 --> 01:06:59,496
Wow, she was being honest.

1577
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:01,526
Wow, she was being honest.

1578
01:07:01,526 --> 01:07:03,596
(She's in love with him.)

1579
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:05,026
Wow, she was being honest.

1580
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:09,396
Would you like to meet him in private after recording the show?

1581
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:12,096
(Would you like to meet him in private after recording the show?)

1582
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:13,126
Yes.

1583
01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:15,926
(Will their love continue off-air?)

1584
01:07:15,926 --> 01:07:17,956
Ji Eun, you're an idol member.

1585
01:07:24,326 --> 01:07:26,526
(Kwang Soo's heart flutters.)

1586
01:07:27,396 --> 01:07:30,096
(It's time to check Kwang Soo's feelings.)

1587
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:34,896
(Is Kwang Soo's love for Ji Eun true?)

1588
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:36,696
This is amazing.

1589
01:07:37,426 --> 01:07:38,826
- Let's see. - I'm feeling confident.

1590
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:41,656
- If you're lying, I'm going home. - I'm confident.

1591
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:44,426
- I'm really confident, Ji Eun. - I'll actually go home.

1592
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:46,256
Would you like to meet her again privately?

1593
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:48,296
(It's the same question.)

1594
01:07:48,296 --> 01:07:49,356
Yes.

1595
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:54,256
(My heart is pounding.)

1596
01:07:55,096 --> 01:07:57,626
(This is the truth, Ji Eun.)

1597
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:03,126
(She smacks him.)

1598
01:08:03,656 --> 01:08:06,356
(Aren't you forgetting something?)

1599
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:10,026
We're shooting a show here.

1600
01:08:10,026 --> 01:08:11,796
(Ji Hyo is worried about them making the headlines of the news.)

1601
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,796
- What show? - Get to work.

1602
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:15,426
Why are you hitting on her?

1603
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:17,526
What are you talking about?

1604
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:19,056
What's going on?

1605
01:08:19,056 --> 01:08:20,056
(Was that really the truth?)

1606
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:21,256
Kwang Soo.

1607
01:08:21,256 --> 01:08:23,896
Would you date me if I asked you out?

1608
01:08:24,196 --> 01:08:25,256
I'm sorry, what?

1609
01:08:25,256 --> 01:08:27,166
What? I have to say yes?

1610
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:29,526
- Yes, to show the machine works. - Okay, then.

1611
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,026
- Will you date me? - Yes.

1612
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:37,056
(Let's see if Kwang Soo was serious about his previous answer.)

1613
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:39,456
(Oh, gosh.)

1614
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:44,096
(Machines do not lie.)

1615
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:47,126
(This means he was serious about Ji Eun.)

1616
01:08:47,126 --> 01:08:49,396
Are you okay?

1617
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,496
The machine works.

1618
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:54,226
- It works, Kwang Soo. - It's a weird feeling.

1619
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:58,826
(Exclusive news! Kwang Soo was serious about Ji Eun.)

1620
01:08:58,896 --> 01:09:01,166
(Kwang Soo is Ji Eun's kind of guy.)

1621
01:09:01,996 --> 01:09:08,196
(Did Kwang Soo find the other half of his life?)

1622
01:09:08,856 --> 01:09:10,456
(Meanwhile, in Gary's studio)

1623
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:11,666
It has to sound like a runaway.

1624
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:19,056
(Musician Hee Geon is busy writing lyrics.)

1625
01:09:21,496 --> 01:09:25,456
(The recording begins.)

1626
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:29,596
(He's charismatic.)

1627
01:09:30,126 --> 01:09:33,856
(He looks cool all of a sudden.)

1628
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:36,596
(He's trying his hardest as if he's releasing a new album.)

1629
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:37,626
I'll go again.

1630
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:39,396
(He's trying his hardest as if he's releasing a new album.)

1631
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:40,496
Let me do go again.

1632
01:09:40,496 --> 01:09:42,996
(He's trying his hardest as if he's releasing a new album.)

1633
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:44,526
This is a party for the winners

1634
01:09:44,526 --> 01:09:46,096
The night is victorious

1635
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:51,526
(We might hit the top views.)

1636
01:09:51,596 --> 01:09:53,126
There's no right or wrong

1637
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:55,256
Watch your back and know who you are

1638
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:56,596
Run

1639
01:09:57,356 --> 01:09:59,396
(He finishes recording in the blink of an eye.)

1640
01:10:01,856 --> 01:10:04,456
(Gary is infatuated with his music.)

1641
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:09,166
- Are we done? - Not yet.

1642
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,096
- There's more? - We have to take the video now.

1643
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:14,496
(Mikey of Turbo came to help but is exhausted now.)

1644
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,926
It's a workout for everyone.

1645
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:20,926
It's easy to follow even for beginners.

1646
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:25,796
This is what people need.

1647
01:10:25,796 --> 01:10:29,026
(What's he doing?)

1648
01:10:29,026 --> 01:10:30,666
Are you warming up?

1649
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:31,996
Where did you learn that?

1650
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:33,226
My trainer taught me.

1651
01:10:34,256 --> 01:10:35,396
- That? - Yes.

1652
01:10:35,526 --> 01:10:37,426
- He told you to do that? - Yes.

1653
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:39,296
(It caught on to other people.)

1654
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:40,826
I've never seen anything like that.

1655
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:42,126
Like this.

1656
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:44,996
(It's addictive.)

1657
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:48,226
We start off with a squat.

1658
01:10:49,296 --> 01:10:51,126
One squat.

1659
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:52,296
One.

1660
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:56,256
Go down, straighten your legs and do a push-up.

1661
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:58,526
- Okay? - Okay.

1662
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:00,096
(Kook's Workout consists of squats and push-ups.)

1663
01:11:00,096 --> 01:11:02,756
Come back up and jump. Easy, right?

1664
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:04,296
Do it in one motion. One.

1665
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:07,196
There you go. Push up.

1666
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,096
Stand up and jump.

1667
01:11:09,226 --> 01:11:11,356
Hold still. One, two.

1668
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:12,696
(I want my mum.)

1669
01:11:12,826 --> 01:11:13,956
Release.

1670
01:11:14,756 --> 01:11:16,826
- Hold them up. - They're so heavy.

1671
01:11:17,326 --> 01:11:19,296
Let's do one more. One, two, three.

1672
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:21,826
This is easy.

1673
01:11:21,996 --> 01:11:23,526
A push-up. Then come up bending your legs.

1674
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:25,396
(Kook's Workout consists of crawling and push-ups.)

1675
01:11:25,396 --> 01:11:27,726
- I can do it. - Now, jump.

1676
01:11:27,726 --> 01:11:29,056
(What will become of Kook's Workout?)

1677
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:31,996
- Let go. - Wait, this feels awkward.

1678
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,626
This is weird.

1679
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:37,756
You have to stretch it out after a workout.

1680
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:39,326
- Hey. - What is this?

1681
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:40,496
Sleepy.

1682
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,896
(He's Deep Sleepy.)

1683
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:42,956
Hey.

1684
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:45,596
- He's sleeping. - Hey.

1685
01:11:45,596 --> 01:11:51,056
(Tell my family that Kook's Workout was fun.)

1686
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:54,856
Hey, wake up.

1687
01:11:55,756 --> 01:11:57,856
- Wake up. - I'm good.

1688
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,726
You have to tell the viewers how great the workout was.

1689
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:02,096
- Where am I? - Get up.

1690
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:04,826
You have to encourage the viewers.

1691
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:08,296
There are beginners like you out there.

1692
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:09,926
If you do the workout,

1693
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,666
(If you do the workout,)

1694
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:12,956
you'll feel energetic.

1695
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:14,626
(That's hilarious.)

1696
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:18,226
Exercising is great for your body.

1697
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:21,196
Do you think you'll get a nice body from this workout?

1698
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:22,256
I got it already.

1699
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:23,926
See? It worked.

1700
01:12:23,926 --> 01:12:25,226
I'm here now.

1701
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:26,796
(Someone came to see Trainer Kook.)

1702
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:28,196
If I go to see Jong Kook,

1703
01:12:28,596 --> 01:12:32,456
he'll know I'm up to something.

1704
01:12:32,456 --> 01:12:33,666
(How can I take his shoe off?)

1705
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:34,826
What should I do?

1706
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:38,166
I'm being chased.

1707
01:12:38,696 --> 01:12:41,696
I don't have the luxury to spend time with other members.

1708
01:12:42,226 --> 01:12:43,456
Things might go south.

1709
01:12:43,596 --> 01:12:44,726
(Jae Seok)

1710
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:46,926
(Ji Hyo is right behind him.)

1711
01:12:46,926 --> 01:12:48,496
I need to catch the thief.

1712
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:49,666
(Ji Hyo starts chasing Scene-stealer Jae Seok.)

1713
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:50,996
- I'll go in first. - Okay.

1714
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:55,096
Can you take us to Hyundai Senior High School?

1715
01:12:55,596 --> 01:12:56,726
(Ji Hyo)

1716
01:12:57,526 --> 01:12:58,596
(Haha)

1717
01:12:58,956 --> 01:13:02,126
I have to take the cab. I'm going to chase him, too.

1718
01:13:02,126 --> 01:13:04,666
(Haha is also chasing Jae Seok.)

1719
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:08,526
Is the actual mission starting now?

1720
01:13:08,696 --> 01:13:10,596
Does the prize only go to the one person that catches him?

1721
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,626
(Only one person can steal Jae Seok's views.)

1722
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:16,526
(Everyone moves towards Jae Seok.)

1723
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:17,696
Gosh.

1724
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:20,056
I might get caught here.

1725
01:13:21,526 --> 01:13:22,826
One, two, three.

1726
01:13:22,826 --> 01:13:24,056
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1727
01:13:25,796 --> 01:13:27,996
- Let's go! - Why are they underground?

1728
01:13:28,526 --> 01:13:30,756
- Hey, Sleepy. - Hello.

1729
01:13:31,226 --> 01:13:33,526
What are you doing here?

1730
01:13:33,526 --> 01:13:35,726
I have to stop by everywhere.

1731
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:37,826
- Why? - Let's get Jae Seok to try.

1732
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,756
- I have to go. - Go where?

1733
01:13:39,756 --> 01:13:41,056
- Work out with us. - What?

1734
01:13:41,056 --> 01:13:43,326
- Let's start exercising. - I don't have the time.

1735
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:44,456
Why are you here?

1736
01:13:44,456 --> 01:13:47,356
I have to do my mission as Scene-stealer.

1737
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,666
- What's that? - I have to be in your videos.

1738
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,256
That's fine. You can work out with us.

1739
01:13:52,256 --> 01:13:53,526
No, I'm really tired.

1740
01:13:53,526 --> 01:13:56,526
We have to work out for the video. What are you supposed to do?

1741
01:13:56,526 --> 01:13:58,856
I'm not sure. I'm really tired.

1742
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,496
I've been running around everywhere.

1743
01:14:00,496 --> 01:14:02,056
(The members are after me. I can't stay here for long.)

1744
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:05,826
It said we should watch out for Scene-stealer.

1745
01:14:05,826 --> 01:14:09,726
(It said we should watch out for Scene-stealer.)

1746
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,796
It said we should watch out for Scene-stealer.

1747
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,496
- Why? - That's what it said.

1748
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,296
Oh, I know.

1749
01:14:16,296 --> 01:14:18,796
That's because I'm taking video time from you.

1750
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:21,396
- Hence the name, Scene-stealer. - I see.

1751
01:14:21,396 --> 01:14:23,666
Are you supposed to do something?

1752
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,326
Not really.

1753
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:29,726
I'm supposed to take 10 percent of your time on the video.

1754
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:31,456
- I'll be mine. - 10 percent?

1755
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:35,166
(Is Jong Kook getting suspicious?)

1756
01:14:35,256 --> 01:14:38,956
If he takes Jong Kook's shoe, it might get difficult for us.

1757
01:14:38,956 --> 01:14:40,996
(The game depends on Jae Seok.)

1758
01:14:40,996 --> 01:14:43,056
He must be around here somewhere.

1759
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:47,996
(The three-minute videos will be released after the show.)

1760
01:14:47,996 --> 01:14:50,526
(Members will be ranked according to the number of views of the videos.)

1761
01:14:50,526 --> 01:14:52,896
(The videos will be open for 24 hours after the show.)

1762
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:55,626
(The fate of Running Man lies in your hands. Click now!)

1763
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:58,126
(The chase to catch Scene-stealer begins.)

1764
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:00,296
Jae Seok is Scene-stealer.

1765
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:01,326
(The identity of Scene-stealer has been revealed.)

1766
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:03,166
- He started to move. - He's at Han River.

1767
01:15:03,226 --> 01:15:04,526
Where's Jae Seok?

1768
01:15:04,756 --> 01:15:06,256
I'm going to try my hardest.

1769
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:07,596
(We have to catch Scene-stealer.)

1770
01:15:07,596 --> 01:15:10,226
(Get back the viewership he stole.)

1771
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:11,396
Let's find Jae Seok.

1772
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:12,996
I'll go after him, too.

1773
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:14,196
(They chase.)

1774
01:15:14,196 --> 01:15:16,196
(He runs.)

1775
01:15:16,356 --> 01:15:17,456
Did you find him?

1776
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,096
(The result of this chase...)

1777
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:20,856
(will decide the fate of next week's race.)

1778
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:23,326
(How will this chase end?)

1779
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:26,666
(The fate of 7 Running Man members lies in your hands.)

1780
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:29,166
(Look up Running Man on Internet portals now.)
