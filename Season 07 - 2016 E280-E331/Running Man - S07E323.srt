1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:03,176
Hello.

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:06,276
How come you get in here as if it were your car?

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,546
- Do I have a secret mission? - Please, wear this in your ear.

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,946
Wait. Listen to me, please.

5
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,676
What's this?

6
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:15,506
Please follow the instructions given through this in-ear headphones.

7
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,346
- Through this? What's going on? - Wear that in your left ear.

8
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:18,776
But this is my right ear.

9
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:20,506
What? What's going on?

10
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:21,976
Why?

11
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:23,306
What's all this?

12
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,306
(A car opens.)

13
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:26,976
What's going on?

14
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,876
(This is such an absurd way to start the show.)

15
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:30,076
Hello.

16
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:32,476
Hello. What's all this?

17
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:33,946
(Finally, they are greeting each other.)

18
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,106
Kwang Soo.

19
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,006
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Hey, Gary.

20
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,206
- Seok Jin, Hello. - Hi, Jae Seok.

21
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:43,146
- Hello. - Kwang Soo, stop saying 'hello'.

22
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:50,206
(There's someone.)

23
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:55,116
(You must follow the orders given to you through the radio.)

24
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,376
You want me to stop greeting them?

25
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:57,746
I don't hear anything.

26
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,576
Go five steps forward.

27
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:01,076
- What? - I don't hear anything.

28
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:03,616
(It's not so bad if the orders are like this.)

29
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:05,646
Why can't I greet them?

30
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:06,646
Go on your stomach.

31
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:08,646
- Pardon? - Go on your stomach.

32
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,376
(Get down, Kwang Soo.)

33
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,106
What is this?

34
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,176
(He doesn't even question.)

35
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:15,176
What are you doing?

36
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:18,106
(The members are getting suspicious of Kwang Soo.)

37
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:19,876
Five push-ups.

38
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:22,806
(The orders are getting harder.)

39
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,706
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

40
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,346
Roll forward.

41
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:32,206
Why should I?

42
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,906
- Who are you? Why? - Roll forward.

43
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,376
(Jae Seok starts off with rolling forward.)

44
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,376
(Plopping)

45
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:40,076
What is this about?

46
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:43,106
- Kim Jong Kook. - Yes.

47
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,406
Pull up your shirt.

48
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:47,906
Pull up my shirt?

49
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:52,246
No. You have to show your skin.

50
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,906
- Show some skin. - Pardon?

51
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,076
(He's surprised.)

52
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:59,806
Pull up your shirt for about 20cm.

53
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:01,076
You want me to pull it up?

54
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:02,846
20cm.

55
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,546
(Roar)

56
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:08,176
- Stay like this. - What do you want me to do?

57
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,806
- Stay like this. - Isn't it too much to do this?

58
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:14,376
It's okay. They'll blur it out for you.

59
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,516
What? What do you want me to do?

60
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:17,016
(It's been blurred perfectly.)

61
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:18,106
I have it up.

62
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:22,306
We have an emergency order.

63
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,906
Now, you must find the hidden chair number one...

64
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:30,806
and put it on the mat. That team will get an advantage.

65
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:34,446
- Kwang Soo, this is the mission. - You need to find...

66
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,706
(They must find the chair first.)

67
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,376
(They're giving the order to their trustworthy avatars.)

68
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:42,376
- You have to find chair number one. - Find it, then you have to bring...

69
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,976
(Avatars that understood faster leaves first.)

70
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,076
Hurry and find it.

71
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:50,246
Find chair number one and put it on the mat.

72
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,806
While looking for the chair,

73
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:57,406
say "I'm ugly" three times.

74
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,206
I'm ugly.

75
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,006
(The avatar's life is so busy.)

76
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:03,546
I'm ugly.

77
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:06,606
I'm ugly.

78
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:08,706
Run, run, run.

79
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,306
Where is the Japanese chair?

80
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,646
Chair number one. It's chair number one.

81
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:13,806
(You're not looking for a Japanese chair.)

82
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:16,146
Chair number one, not a Japanese hair.

83
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,276
Chair number one...

84
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,406
Hurry up. Find it, Kwang Soo.

85
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,946
I want to find it, too.

86
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,506
Hold on. Can you get up for a second?

87
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,606
- I think Seok Jin found it. - Yes.

88
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,906
Go and stop Seok Jin.

89
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,146
(They found chair number one.)

90
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:33,776
- Stop Seok Jin. Stop Seok Jin. - Go stop Seok Jin.

91
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:34,946
You can do it, Seok Jin.

92
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:36,506
Come on, Seok Jin.

93
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,276
Let's get out first.

94
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:41,146
Seok Jin, tell them you made an acrostic poem about the chair.

95
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,076
I have to do well. I made a good poem about the chair.

96
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,106
- Really? - Why would you do that?

97
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:49,646
- It won't be good. - What are you trying to do?

98
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,246
- Help me start off. - Chair.

99
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:53,476
- Chair. - Call the doctor.

100
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,506
- Call the doctor! - Wait...

101
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:55,646
If you steal this...

102
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:56,646
All right.

103
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,546
Jong Kook, get ready to throw a punch.

104
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,006
All right, that's all I have.

105
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,376
- How do I snatch this? - All right, that's all I have.

106
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,376
(Slapping)

107
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,906
Why are you being like that?

108
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,876
Seok Jin's master.

109
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,176
Put it down.

110
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,646
- Let's put it down. - Put it down.

111
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:15,506
You have to take the chair to the blue mat and sit on it.

112
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,176
- Focus. - Jong Kook, sit on it.

113
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,176
(Of course he tries to cheat.)

114
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,246
- You're disqualified. - Sit on it. Sit on it.

115
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,746
Good job, Jong Kook. Just kick him.

116
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:25,746
Steal it, Kwang Soo.

117
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,816
Hurry. You have to sit on the chair.

118
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:28,976
(Chaos)

119
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,446
- Haha, take the mat and run. - Go on the mat.

120
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,776
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

121
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,076
- Run away. - Get him.

122
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:38,076
(Haha is running away with the mat.)

123
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,976
It's useless without the mat. Those fools.

124
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:41,176
Hey!

125
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:43,976
(He succeeds in sitting.)

126
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,376
Good work.

127
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:46,506
(Jong Kook is so good.)

128
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:47,776
You did well. Good boy.

129
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:50,406
Good boy. They called me a good boy.

130
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,646
- We have to follow orders. - It's hard.

131
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,476
We didn't do anything, but I'm already tired.

132
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,816
Jae Seok, we'll bring in your master.

133
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:00,106
Who is it? I'm so curious.

134
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:01,646
- Jae Seok, was it a woman? - She...

135
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,546
- She sounded a bit mature. - Really?

136
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,146
(Who could it be?)

137
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,906
- You can tell. - Could it be Ahn Moon Sook?

138
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,076
She wasn't that old.

139
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,406
(Could she be...)

140
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:14,076
- Right? - You're right.

141
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:15,776
Seriously?

142
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,876
- Seo Ji Hye. - Wow.

143
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:22,076
(She's an actress starring in "Jealousy Incarnate".)

144
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,706
- I was her teacher. - Yes, that's right.

145
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:25,806
Pardon? Do you know me?

146
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,606
Seo Ji Hye. Am I wrong?

147
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,276
- It's Seo Ji Hye. - How did you know me 10 years ago?

148
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:32,606
- I met you on a different show. - 10 years ago?

149
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,506
- Where? - Ji Hye has no idea.

150
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,606
This is embarrassing.

151
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,146
- What's wrong with you? - What's your problem?

152
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,606
You don't even know her.

153
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,376
- I'm embarrassed for him. - It was on a different show...

154
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,176
- Stop it. - Don't you remember me?

155
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:45,876
- She really doesn't know you. - She changed.

156
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,806
- You put me in an awkward position. - She changed.

157
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,906
- She's surprised. - I'm sorry.

158
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:53,106
- We've met before, right? - I'm in a very awkward position.

159
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,906
Haha made it really awkward.

160
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,646
- Do you really not remember? - Haha, stop it.

161
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,046
- Jong Kook. - What's wrong with you?

162
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,976
- Don't be so pathetic. - I remember she was on some shows.

163
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,406
She was.

164
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,706
- What? - I didn't do that many.

165
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:07,376
- "The War of Roses". - Yes, "The War of Roses".

166
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,976
- Is this true? - Were you in it, too?

167
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:12,606
- I was really the bomb. - Forget it. Stop being a loser.

168
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,806
You were in it, too?

169
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,306
He says he was the bomb.

170
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,376
- You had no presence. - I was really awesome.

171
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:18,646
(Seo Ji Hye)

172
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:23,376
(She appeared on a variety show in 2002 as a college student.)

173
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:28,076
(Haha was ignored.)

174
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,306
(Just like 14 years ago, he's ignored again.)

175
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,876
She didn't think she saw you at a place like that.

176
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,346
You've changed.

177
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:35,346
No...

178
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,176
Why are you saying that?

179
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:41,676
- Next, it's Haha's master. - Good, good.

180
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,606
- I hope it's someone Haha knows. - Me, too.

181
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,606
(Muscular)

182
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,706
- You said it's a man, right? - What is this?

183
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,776
What's with the leg?

184
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:53,206
- It's Kim Joon Hyun. - It's Joon Hyun.

185
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,406
Nice ankle.

186
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:56,546
Are we shooting a food show today?

187
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,276
- Why are you sweating already? - What?

188
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,376
They gave me a long sleeve shirt since it's fall.

189
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,946
Usually we don't have lining inside.

190
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,506
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

191
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,606
It was a woman's voice.

192
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,806
- A woman? - I hope you have bad luck.

193
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:12,106
- Why? - Seok Jin or Kwang Soo has Ji Hyo.

194
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:15,706
Come on, Ji Hyo.

195
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:16,876
(They are right.)

196
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,506
- I told you. - It's Ji Hyo.

197
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,206
- You got it right. - Her entrance is so scary.

198
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,976
Ji Hyo came to work today.

199
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,946
It's going to be a fierce game.

200
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,406
- Kim Jong Kook. - It's a beauty.

201
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:30,506
- Is it a beauty? - Yes.

202
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:32,176
- I'm excited. - I can't wait.

203
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,246
- Do Yeon? - It's Do Yeon.

204
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,606
- Balloon. Look at the balloon. - Her arm is like a man's.

205
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,306
That's not Jang Do Yeon.

206
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,306
- Is it not? -That's a man.

207
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:41,576
- It's not her. - It's Jang Do Yeon.

208
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,346
- I told you. - Yes.

209
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:45,876
How great.

210
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:49,446
- She cut her hair. - Her orders were great.

211
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,006
- Hello. - Hello.

212
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:53,046
- Your haircut suits you. - Yes.

213
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,206
- Liar. - He thought you were a man.

214
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,476
Who said my arm is like a man's?

215
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,076
You look more like Goo Bon Seung with this hair.

216
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:02,206
- Really? - You're exactly the same.

217
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,606
(They're like twins.)

218
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,006
- Goo Bon Seung? - Goo Bon Seung.

219
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,376
- I'm curious. - I guess you can get confused.

220
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:09,246
Seok Jin, did you have a man?

221
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,346
Yes.

222
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,606
- He made him recite poems. - That poem was...

223
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:16,046
- It's Se Chan. - Se Chan.

224
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,906
- It's Se Chan. - Hey, Se Chan.

225
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,606
- Hey, Se Chan. - Again?

226
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:21,506
(They're back together again.)

227
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,146
Why do you complain about the poems?

228
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,306
It was funny, wasn't it?

229
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,746
(We fear for this team.)

230
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,376
Is there an award for the winners?

231
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,506
He's right. I was treated badly.

232
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,076
What is this?

233
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,306
- Who is that? - What is that?

234
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,876
- Blond hair. - It's an idol!

235
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,546
- No, no. - An idol?

236
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,416
(Who is Gary's master?)

237
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:42,576
Min Ho.

238
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,206
(Min Ho)

239
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,006
Why are you making him stand beside me?

240
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:49,176
Is it a penalty for Gary?

241
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,006
- You'll look so ugly today. - This is a penalty.

242
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:55,606
- Two handsome guys. - Get in the shot with him.

243
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,606
This is really a bad target.

244
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,806
No pose can make me look better.

245
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,806
I'll just let it go.

246
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,506
- We're treating Min Ho well. - You're so handsome.

247
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,546
Today's race,

248
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,976
as you have just experienced, is Avatar House.

249
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,276
It's so great.

250
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:16,046
The guests will become...

251
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:19,546
our members' masters to do the race.

252
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:23,046
There are 12 bags in front of you.

253
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:28,776
In them, there are two bags with bombs and one with gold.

254
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:34,106
Each team is to choose a bag to enter the house.

255
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:39,416
After every game, the winning team has a chance to change bags.

256
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,706
The team that ends up with both bombs...

257
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,746
will be getting a huge penalty.

258
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,946
It's already bad as it is.

259
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:49,946
- Go. - Go ahead.

260
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,176
(The bombs are in bags between 7 and 12.)

261
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,246
This one.

262
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:55,976
She picked one.

263
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:57,106
Did they get the answer?

264
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,276
As for me...

265
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,976
One, two, three, four, five and six.

266
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,106
- There's something inside. - Jong Kook has the gold.

267
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,916
- It could be the bomb. - It's a bomb.

268
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,246
The rest of you can select your bags.

269
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,376
- This one is leftover. - Shake it.

270
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:14,246
It's heavy. It's so heavy.

271
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,276
- He's good at acting. - It's heavy.

272
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,746
That's a lie.

273
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,706
(Everyone is using tricks.)

274
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,876
It's so heavy.

275
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:24,546
Joon Hyun is the best.

276
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,276
Let's move to the Avatar House.

277
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:28,276
- Okay. - Okay.

278
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:29,916
(They're entering Avatar House.)

279
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,706
(Avatar House)

280
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:34,176
- What is this? - What's that?

281
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,976
No way. We're not sitting on the small seats, right?

282
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,606
Gosh, they're so cute.

283
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,306
- Sit here, Master. - Seok Jin.

284
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,916
- Yes. - Escort your master.

285
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,916
Yes, Sir.

286
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:46,246
- I'm your master. - Yes, Sir.

287
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,376
- Seok Jin. - Yes, Master.

288
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,006
Even the chairs?

289
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,646
Give me some carbohydrates.

290
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,706
- Carbohydrates? - Give me carbohydrates.

291
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,046
Master, please lie down.

292
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,246
- Seok Jin. - Yes, Master.

293
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,646
How dare you. Go sit on the floor.

294
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:01,146
Yes, Sir.

295
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:02,206
Can you bring me some snacks?

296
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,946
Snacks? Which one?

297
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,306
- I want cookies. - Okay.

298
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,806
Don't lean on your back.

299
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,106
My master is pretending to be mean when he's actually really nice.

300
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,306
I know you're a nice guy.

301
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,346
My heart is beating so fast right now.

302
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,606
I don't like being rude.

303
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,106
My master is very popular right now.

304
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:22,906
- What? - My master is very popular.

305
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,576
- Stop it. - Why?

306
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,176
- Quiet down, Seok Jin. - Yes, Sir.

307
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,246
How old are your avatar?

308
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,006
I'm almost 60.

309
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,106
(50 Years a Slave)

310
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:35,146
- He should be set free now. - He was born a long time ago.

311
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,746
Shouldn't you let him go by now?

312
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,246
He's like an insurance at this point.

313
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:40,976
This guy is a loyal slave.

314
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,506
Spit it out.

315
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:44,876
You said I could eat it.

316
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,246
I told you to peel it for me, not eat it.

317
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,476
Is she allowed to beat me up?

318
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,906
Is she allowed to put her hands on me?

319
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,046
Here.

320
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,106
You look like a dog.

321
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,306
Can you do something about this?

322
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,076
- Poor Kwang Soo. - I'll say.

323
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,376
- This isn't right, you know. - Fine.

324
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:03,076
Kwang Soo's a pet.

325
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,846
I think I know which one of you is the master.

326
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,946
- Look at them. - I'm not feeling any pressure.

327
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,876
I'm very comfortable with my role.

328
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:16,106
They're a prince and a servant.

329
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:18,176
- Master. - Hold still.

330
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,776
- Please. - I said hold still.

331
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:22,606
He's obviously the prince.

332
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,876
Did you all check your suitcases?

333
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,446
- Can we do that now? - Yes.

334
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,576
Don't let other people see you.

335
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:32,446
You can share with your partner, but you can't see anyone else's.

336
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:34,076
You can go check it out.

337
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,746
- Let's go, Master. - Should we go now?

338
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,106
Let's go over to the corner, Master.

339
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,176
(He's looking around.)

340
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:51,106
(Some look relieved and others look surprised.)

341
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,876
(What's this, Master?)

342
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,476
I think we should put on an act.

343
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,706
We have to make a good switch.

344
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,506
Should I open it first?

345
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:08,006
(The key is to swap the suitcases so the team can benefit from it.)

346
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,906
I'm 100 percent certain that we're not carrying the bomb.

347
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:14,606
See? Oh, wait.

348
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,006
Oh, gosh.

349
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,146
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok are carrying the bomb.)

350
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,806
Did you have to pick that one?

351
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,146
- I don't have anything. - That's good.

352
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,706
This isn't good.

353
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:32,176
- I'll open mine first. - Okay.

354
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,476
(Jong Kook's suitcase is empty.)

355
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,076
Is that possible?

356
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,046
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook got gold.)

357
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,146
I can tell you're acting, Do Yeon.

358
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,246
(I'm not, actually.)

359
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:49,046
This is good. I'm satisfied.

360
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,776
Jong Kook got something. I'm sure of it.

361
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:56,776
(Who's the other one carrying the bomb?)

362
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:01,346
(People have finished checking their suitcases.)

363
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,606
This is the first mission.

364
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:03,706
- Mission? - It's an announcement.

365
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,776
- We shall begin "Spin the Bomb". - "Spin the Bomb"?

366
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,806
The winner of each round gets to swap the suitcases.

367
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,406
(What's going on?)

368
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,006
There's something on the screen.

369
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,146
- This is the first mission. - "Back Hug Jjajangmyeon"?

370
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,506
This round is called "Back Hug Jjajangmyeon".

371
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:21,946
- It's something we're good at. - Nice.

372
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:25,076
The master will have a blindfold on behind the avatar...

373
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:28,006
and feed the avatar jjajangmyeon while doing a back hug.

374
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,806
- This is going to be hard. - So I don't get to eat it?

375
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:33,946
The team who finishes jjajangmyeon the fastest and cleanest...

376
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,506
will get the chance to swap their suitcases.

377
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,906
Don't worry, Master. Don't go easy on me.

378
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,606
Just put it in there.

379
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,806
- It's really jjajangmyeon. - It's gan jjajangmyeon.

380
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:46,546
(Here comes freshly made jjajangmyeon.)

381
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:47,576
That looks good.

382
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:50,446
- It's all soft once it's mixed up. - This is nice.

383
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:53,176
- Is this seafood jjajangmyeon? - I'm so hungry for some.

384
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,906
Jong Kook hasn't had jjajangmyeon for three years.

385
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,246
Can he have chicken breast instead of the noodles?

386
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,406
Do you have any idea how much oil they use to make jjajangmyeon?

387
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:03,976
- Here he goes again. - Just eat it.

388
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,846
It's his 1st time in 3 years eating jjajangmyeon.

389
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:08,376
- Do Yeon, close up his mouth. - That's unbelievable.

390
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,946
How else is he going to eat, then?

391
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,446
(Will Jong Kook give up on his strict diet for his master?)

392
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:14,506
- Did you take your glasses off? - Yes.

393
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:17,446
Oh, my.

394
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,406
- You're going to do it like that? - You liked that?

395
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,076
I mean...

396
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,106
You look thrilled.

397
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:25,276
Can avatars have feelings for their masters?

398
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:27,546
Did you see what my master did?

399
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,976
- What are you doing? - That was...

400
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,676
- What? - Are you in love with your master?

401
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,346
- Oh, my. - What's going on here?

402
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:36,446
She's serious.

403
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,646
You look too ugly to be like that right now.

404
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,646
What does it have anything to do with how I look?

405
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:41,946
Why does that matter?

406
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,606
All I'm saying is that it's not a good look.

407
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,806
I'll do an acrostic poem for Seok Jin.

408
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,646
- This one's for him. - This should be good.

409
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,846
It's about jjajangmyeon.

410
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,206
- Hey, you. - "Hey, you"?

411
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,846
Are you kidding me?

412
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,476
Eat your noodles.

413
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:55,606
Nice one.

414
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,246
- That was good. - Did you like that?

415
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:59,876
- I want to try next. - Did you like that?

416
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,876
Who's it for?

417
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,506
It's about jjajangmyeon. It's for Seok Jin again.

418
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,506
Give it a go.

419
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,006
- Hey, you. - "Hey, you."

420
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,406
Are you kidding me?

421
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,746
I'll punch you in the face.

422
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,706
That was good.

423
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,506
Way to go, Master.

424
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,176
- I liked the last line. - I gave it a try.

425
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,106
- I think my master is ready now. - I see.

426
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:17,576
Try it.

427
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:18,906
Why you little...

428
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,376
Are you impersonating Joo Hyun?

429
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:22,506
Are you kidding me?

430
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,006
Can I have the noodles?

431
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,606
I'm hungry right now.

432
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,676
- Good one, Master. - Someone give him some noodles.

433
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,476
Let's get the first round started.

434
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:32,876
- Let's go! - Let's go!

435
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,176
Go, Master!

436
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,576
I've said it many times. You're not supposed to chew on it.

437
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:37,606
Got it.

438
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:38,946
(Understood, Master.)

439
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,706
- Let's go, Kwang Soo. - Let's do this.

440
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,376
Ready.

441
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:48,176
(We have to take first place and get rid of the bomb.)

442
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,476
Ready, set, go!

443
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,946
Let's go.

444
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,906
(She's looking for it.)

445
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,146
You're doing good.

446
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,476
That's too much.

447
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,576
(It's a big mouthful.)

448
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,206
(He tries a bite.)

449
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,776
Look where the noodles end.

450
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,776
This isn't "Baek Jong Won's Top 3 Chef King".

451
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,046
I got it.

452
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,116
Start eating.

453
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,116
Stop. Don't do that.

454
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,146
(Kwang Soo gets his face washed with jjajangmyeon.)

455
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,746
There's no time to taste. Just push it down.

456
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,376
(This is the last time I'm eating jjajangmyeon.)

457
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,646
Don't taste it.

458
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,706
Where are you?

459
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:27,206
(That's not the mouth, Master.)

460
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:30,246
- Just put it in there. - That's my eye.

461
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:31,676
(He's eating away.)

462
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,276
Stop it.

463
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,176
Why are you taking so long?

464
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,806
You're doing good, Master.

465
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,446
(She shoves it in there.)

466
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:43,546
Can we take a short break?

467
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,146
There's no time for that.

468
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:47,906
- What are you talking about? - I should go like this.

469
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:51,376
That's too much. That's way too much.

470
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,406
Start eating.

471
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:57,176
(Jjajangmyeon is good for cleansing your face with.)

472
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,246
Why aren't you eating any? Start eating.

473
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:01,046
- My throat hurts. - Start eating!

474
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:04,846
Don't bite. Just swallow it down.

475
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,906
Less talking, more eating.

476
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,276
(Jae Seok is leading, followed by Haha, Kwang Soo and Jong Kook.)

477
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,476
You're doing good.

478
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,146
(The master has good technique and the avatar has a big mouth.)

479
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,246
- There's so much left. - Where are you?

480
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,506
- Are we done? - Where are you?

481
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,076
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo won.

482
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,576
No way.

483
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,706
(It's clean.)

484
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,476
(He's done already?)

485
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,546
Why did you do so bad?

486
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:37,616
You didn't give me any time to chew on it.

487
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,546
You just kept shoving more in.

488
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,006
There's no time for chewing.

489
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,006
Do I deserve to get beat up?

490
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,246
- What's wrong this time? - Look at her.

491
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,116
Just do as I say.

492
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:50,346
What is this?

493
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,176
My avatar is so bad at this.

494
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,646
My throat hurts.

495
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:55,806
(Master, you're overly passionate.)

496
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,776
- Did he make you upset? - Yes.

497
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,746
He still looks very upset.

498
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:03,476
I can't even turn my head right now. My neck muscles are sore.

499
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,576
Gary was so slow.

500
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,876
He even tried to shove my face down to the bowl.

501
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:09,076
(His master isn't scared of getting his hands dirty.)

502
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,506
He pressed down on me.

503
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:11,776
(His master isn't scared of getting his hands dirty.)

504
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,346
I was just helping you.

505
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,276
You poked me in the acupuncture point.

506
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,006
Sorry about that.

507
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:21,176
My master likes to win.

508
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,206
She was like this.

509
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,776
My master likes to win.

510
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,746
She was amazing.

511
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:29,616
Do we get to swap suitcases now?

512
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:32,116
Jae Seok and Ji Hye will be given an exchange ticket.

513
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,616
(Jae Seok and Ji Hye are given the chance to swap suitcases.)

514
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,776
Let's see here.

515
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,306
(We should get rid of the bomb.)

516
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:37,706
You should try to get the gold.

517
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,246
I want gold.

518
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,876
Chances are Jong Kook has it.

519
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:44,116
- I don't care if you take it. - What should we do?

520
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,476
- We should swap one. - Okay.

521
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,376
Which one do you want?

522
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:48,776
I want this one.

523
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:50,946
They wouldn't let their gold lying around like that.

524
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:51,946
What are you talking about?

525
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,646
(They exchange their suitcase to the one that was hidden.)

526
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:56,446
- We could easily tell you had it. - Oh, really?

527
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,616
Is that the bomb?

528
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:58,976
We'll go with this one.

529
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:03,406
The two teams will now check their suitcases in secret.

530
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:06,346
I think the one Jae Seok had was the bomb.

531
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,346
That means Jong Kook has it now.

532
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,906
We'll all know who has what shortly.

533
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:11,976
It's probably the bomb.

534
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:13,116
My master...

535
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,346
doesn't care about the game. He just wants to eat jjajangmyeon.

536
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:19,806
Don't let my noodles get cold.

537
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,306
(This is the suitcase Jae Seok and Ji Hye gave them.)

538
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,006
(It's the bomb.)

539
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,006
I knew it.

540
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,176
They'll know it's the bomb once they open it.

541
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,506
(What did Jae Seok and Ji Hye get?)

542
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:47,116
(It's gold.)

543
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:50,306
(They got the golden touch.)

544
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:52,806
(He falls over.)

545
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,376
(He got too excited and got himself injured.)

546
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:56,746
Oh, my butt.

547
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,446
(It's quite fun to control Jae Seok actually.)

548
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:04,246
There's gold inside. How did you know?

549
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,776
- At first, I thought of Seok Jin. - Actually,

550
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:10,946
Actually, when we stepped forward,

551
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:14,616
- they peeked at us. - That's right. There was a hint.

552
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,876
- What took you so long? - Hurry up, Jae Seok.

553
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,576
- Come on. - What's wrong with you?

554
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,346
Stop setting him up and come out.

555
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,946
They have both the gold and the bomb.

556
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:24,906
What happened? Did she hug you back there?

557
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,546
- Then what's wrong? - Why are you out of breath?

558
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,706
- No. Nothing. - What did you do?

559
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,306
- What's the matter? - Why?

560
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,476
- He looks really happy. - What's his problem?

561
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:33,246
Now, it's time for Joon Hyun to shine.

562
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,646
- He will win, of course. - Stop giving me pressure.

563
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:36,946
- Come on. - It's your show time.

564
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,346
- It's disadvantageous to us. - I just found out that...

565
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:40,806
- Ji Hye loves to win. - I see.

566
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,506
At the same time,

567
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,746
- Min Ho loves to win, too. - That's right.

568
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:45,506
Min Ho never wants to lose.

569
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:48,906
If he gets defeated one more time,

570
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,806
- he will burst out in anger. - I'm sure he will.

571
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:52,976
Gosh. What should I do?

572
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,376
I need to practise feeding my partner with chopsticks.

573
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,576
And these two, I'm also sure that Kwang Soo will...

574
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,706
- try to revenge. - Revenge?

575
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:00,576
No, I won't. There's no way I'll do it.

576
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:02,546
- I won't. We need to win. - I think...

577
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:05,046
they will not play to win. They will play to revenge.

578
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:07,406
- We won't be able to recognise her. - Of course not.

579
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:09,446
- That sounds very likely. - I play to win.

580
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:12,246
- I'm aiming for victory. - Let's see her face after the game.

581
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:15,106
- What are these? - Why noodles?

582
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:17,276
Everybody thinks that Joon Hyun will win,

583
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,606
but we need to see how things go.

584
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:23,106
I will show you that women can also win.

585
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,546
(Please go easy on me, Kwang Soo.)

586
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,276
- Some can swallow this with a gulp. - Would you like some?

587
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,206
No, thank you.

588
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,946
She loves to cheat.

589
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,346
- She really is. - You heard her, right?

590
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,306
She loves to make fouls.

591
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:37,046
I almost said, "Yes, thank you."

592
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:40,176
- She may be quiet, but... - She cheats quietly.

593
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,746
She's so kind and nice.

594
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:43,146
- You can only use chopsticks. - Ready,

595
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:44,306
set.

596
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,606
(If they win, they can exchange bags with others.)

597
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:47,976
(Gulping)

598
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:51,246
(Will Joon Hyun end up winning? Let's find out.)

599
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,276
Set, go!

600
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:55,206
- Where are the chopsticks? - Yes, you got them.

601
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:58,176
(Come on, masters. You can do it.)

602
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,846
(Kwang Soo picks up a lot of jjajangmyeon.)

603
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,176
She can't eat those at once.

604
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,906
(Kwang Soo is taking his revenge.)

605
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,446
(Pushing)

606
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:09,206
(Seok Jin pushes Se Chan's head forward.)

607
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,346
- You can do it! - Slow down.

608
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,176
(They gulp everything so fast.)

609
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:14,276
All right. There.

610
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,476
You need to chew.

611
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:18,746
- You're doing great. - Don't chew. Just swallow them.

612
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:21,076
She's doing great. She's eating really fast.

613
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,706
- Come on. Swallow them. - She's amazing.

614
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,606
(But we all know who's the fastest eater here.)

615
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:36,506
(He only needs to gulp few times to eat them all.)

616
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:43,506
(Can I order some extra noodles? Thank you.)

617
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,406
- We can beat Joon Hyun. - Hurry up. You're really slow.

618
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,906
- Hurry up. We're almost finished. - You're taking too much time.

619
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,306
I think we're almost finished.

620
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,906
Come on. We can do it.

621
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:53,976
(He's the best at covering her face with sauce.)

622
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:55,976
Come on, Se Chan!

623
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,976
- Take a big gulp. - Come on. Swallow them.

624
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,776
- Hurry up. Swallow. - Come on.

625
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:07,346
- Aren't we finished? - If you are, put your bowl up.

626
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:09,046
She's really amazing.

627
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,446
Hurry up. Show your empty bowl.

628
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,176
- What are you doing? - Aren't you finished yet?

629
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,206
- Okay. - She's unbelievable.

630
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:17,006
- Show them your bowl. - She ate them all.

631
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,806
- She finished it. - Show your bowl to them.

632
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:20,606
- There they are. - Really? Is she finished already?

633
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,006
- I can't find any noodles. - Where are they?

634
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,206
- I can't find them. - Where are they?

635
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,076
(Ta-da)

636
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:28,046
All right. Haha and Joon Hyun won.

637
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:29,506
(Haha and Joon Hyun succeed.)

638
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:32,476
- We finished them as well. - I knew I could count on Joon Hyun.

639
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,876
(I should've been faster.)

640
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,446
- I finished it. - We finished them as well.

641
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:40,606
- That was really quick. - Do Yeon is unbelievable.

642
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:43,406
(I can't accept my defeat. How could they eat so fast?)

643
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,546
- That was amazing. - Do Yeon ate really quickly.

644
00:24:45,546 --> 00:24:47,106
- I ate almost everything. - Gosh.

645
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,576
- Look at her bowl. It's empty. - She ate them all.

646
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:51,146
- She ate a lot. - That was really close.

647
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:54,706
Haha, I thought that was my hand, not yours.

648
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:57,576
- Really? - You put noodles in just like me.

649
00:24:57,576 --> 00:25:00,646
- Joon Hyun is so nice. - That was amazing.

650
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:02,076
- My goodness. - Gosh. Where is Ji Hyo?

651
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:05,076
Min Ho did a great job, too. Oh my gosh. Look at Ji Hyo.

652
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,176
- My goodness. - What happened?

653
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,576
- That is so cruel. - What happened, Ji Hyo?

654
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:12,176
- It's funny. Don't wipe her face. - What happened to you?

655
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,776
- Take a photo before cleaning her. - Okay.

656
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,206
- Anyway, what happened to her? - Take a photo of her face.

657
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,606
Who did this to you?

658
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,246
Is that some kind of a face pack?

659
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:21,946
That must be a jjajang face pack.

660
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:24,676
He even tried to open my mouth with his hand. Like this.

661
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:26,676
I just tried to feed you as fast as I could.

662
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:29,376
(That's why she took her revenge by biting his thumb.)

663
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,906
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

664
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:34,276
Ji Hye is really upset.

665
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:36,246
Leave her. She'll calm herself down.

666
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:38,746
- Calm down. Calm your anger. - The sauce looks like a beard.

667
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,946
Take your time.

668
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:43,176
Min Ho and Ji Hye are really upset because they lost the game.

669
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:45,206
- Don't get in their way. - I can see that.

670
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:47,476
- Min Ho is really upset. - They really are.

671
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,776
- No, I'm not. - Ji Hye did really well, too.

672
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,806
- That was close. - What a pity.

673
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:54,046
- That was really close. - Ji Hye, are you all right?

674
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,446
- You don't know her. Do you? - Come on, Ji Hye.

675
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:59,276
- Stop being too friendly. - That's all right, Ji Hye.

676
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:03,776
(Eating)

677
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,976
All right. Let's take out the jjajangmyeon bowls.

678
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:08,476
- Come on. The game's over. - Hey, I'm not done eating.

679
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:10,476
- Let's take the dishes away. - Let him finish his meal.

680
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:12,276
- It's finished. - Why does he keep eating?

681
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:14,106
The game's over already.

682
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,006
Haha and Joon Hyun will be given an exchange ticket.

683
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:18,146
(They can swap one of their bags.)

684
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,606
- We were so close to winning. - I'm sorry to hear that.

685
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,106
We will...

686
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:25,306
swap with Jae Seok and my sister's team.

687
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:28,046
- That's our choice. - What do you mean, "your sister"?

688
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,976
I mean Ji Hye, of course.

689
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,506
(Ji Hye is my sister.)

690
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,806
- Don't you need my opinion? - I'm sorry, Master.

691
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:37,606
We'll swap our bag with Jae Seok and his sister's team.

692
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:39,676
(He says exactly the same thing as Haha.)

693
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:40,706
He's so kind like an angel.

694
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:42,906
One of their bags must be the bomb.

695
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:44,446
- Am I correct? - Yes, you are.

696
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:45,606
I noticed something...

697
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:47,946
(I think I can feel what's inside.)

698
00:26:47,946 --> 00:26:49,276
- Aren't they the same? - They must be the same.

699
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,976
- Is there a difference? - They must be...

700
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:54,506
- either bomb or gold. - There wouldn't be any gold inside.

701
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,706
I don't think so.

702
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:58,646
How can they weigh just the same?

703
00:26:58,646 --> 00:26:59,706
I'll swap with this bag.

704
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:03,606
- Will you? - You're not experts at all.

705
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,276
- Give one of your bags. - Come and grab one.

706
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,376
Can I check what's inside?

707
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:09,806
(Did they swap the correct bag?)

708
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:12,106
I think this bag is empty.

709
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:14,506
- I thought both bags were empty. - I felt the same.

710
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:18,306
(Is that a gold or an empty bag? There's a 50-50 chance.)

711
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,346
This side.

712
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:22,406
- No. - It's empty.

713
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,446
(They got an empty bag.)

714
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:24,576
- It's empty, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

715
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,746
- Is that the bag with gold? - Yes, this is the one.

716
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,106
- Do we still have it? - Yes, they picked the wrong one.

717
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:35,106
(The gold is still with Jae Seok and Ji Hye.)

718
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:38,746
(It'd be the best for them if the new bag isn't the bomb.)

719
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,576
In my opinion...

720
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,246
- They tried to find a heavier bag. - It must be empty.

721
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,176
- It must be. - Both of their bags were empty.

722
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,646
- They didn't care. - Yes. Both of them must be empty.

723
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:47,706
- Good. - There.

724
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,246
- All right. - It's great so far.

725
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:50,806
Good.

726
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:53,776
- They are really good. - Why?

727
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:56,006
- They are so good. - They are good at acting.

728
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:59,306
- I didn't know. - That room makes everyone actors.

729
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:00,646
- That's really peculiar. - What are we doing here?

730
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,776
- That room changes everyone. - Everyone is acting here.

731
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,206
- You're so good at acting. - Master,

732
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:07,676
- I want to go in there, too. - Jae Seok. Are you confused?

733
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:09,606
- Yes? Yes, I am. - Look. They are acting now.

734
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,606
Why does everyone act after getting out of the room?

735
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,806
There must be something inside the room.

736
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:15,206
We'd also like to go in.

737
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,976
(Here comes the second round of Avatar House.)

738
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:22,006
This round is called, "My Avatar Can".

739
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,946
- What? - After checking the game,

740
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:27,746
masters can make a bid with the number which you think...

741
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:29,276
your avatar can achieve.

742
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,846
My master will bid?

743
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:33,776
- Trust me, Master. - Raise your hand to make your bid.

744
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,006
- I'm in. - I like this kind of game.

745
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:38,646
Only the team with the highest number can make their challenge.

746
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:41,246
- Let's play no matter what. - Call out only if you think I can.

747
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:44,446
Gosh. I don't think you can succeed in any game, Seok Jin.

748
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:45,846
Master, trust me.

749
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:47,506
Please trust me.

750
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,046
- Min Ho will... - My goodness.

751
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,406
Isn't she the famous auctioneer?

752
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:52,946
- Amazing. - Yes, she is.

753
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:55,846
- "What's your bid?" - "Sold!"

754
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,676
- "What's your bid?" - "What's your bid?"

755
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,676
She came all the way here. Hello.

756
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:03,306
Hello, I'm auctioneer Kim Min Seo. I will host today's auction.

757
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,646
(Kim Min Seo, auctioneer)

758
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:08,376
- They brought a real auctioneer. - She has an amazing voice.

759
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:09,746
Yes. Her voice is amazing.

760
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:14,006
I'll give you a brief explanation about the auction.

761
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:16,846
Only the team that makes the bid with the highest number...

762
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:18,546
can challenge the mission.

763
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:21,576
If the team succeeds,

764
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,406
they will be given the exchange ticket.

765
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:26,746
- Good. - Master!

766
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,076
- I'll trust you this time. - What if we fail?

767
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:30,646
- There must be a penalty. - If you challenge and fail,

768
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:34,606
you must open and show one of your bags to everyone as a penalty.

769
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,876
- That's the penalty. - Please be careful with your bids.

770
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,546
- Do we need to open our bags? - Is that the penalty?

771
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:41,946
- Yes, it is. - The penalty is huge.

772
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,706
- That's tough. - Do we need to show both bags...

773
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:46,206
- or only one? - Do we need to show only one bag?

774
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,406
- Yes. One. - Okay.

775
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,276
You're asking because one of your bags isn't empty, right?

776
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:51,976
- That's right. - That was a sharp question.

777
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:54,376
(Min Ho is a sharp detective.)

778
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,346
Okay. I'll tell you the first game.

779
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:59,146
The first game is...

780
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:02,106
(What kind of game will they play?)

781
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,846
- "Break the Bananas". - What?

782
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:06,106
It's called "Break the Bananas".

783
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,776
- What kind of game is that? - You only have one minute.

784
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:11,106
Please guess how many pieces your avatar can break...

785
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,506
- How many pieces? I see. - Do we need to break the most?

786
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,006
- Yes. - We have a minute.

787
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:16,206
We'll break bananas for a minute.

788
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:20,776
Please consider carefully and make your bids.

789
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,576
- All right. Let's see. - It's quite easy.

790
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:25,006
Let's try. Break one banana.

791
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:26,806
- It's quite easy. - It's easy, isn't it?

792
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:30,146
- Try the other way. Good job. - It's quite easy.

793
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:31,846
- What is this? - It's really easy.

794
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:35,646
It's quite easy. We can call more than 30.

795
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,006
My master is very strict and passionate.

796
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,376
Why? What's the matter?

797
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,106
"You can break more than 30, can't you?"

798
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,676
The starting bid is 10 bananas.

799
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,046
Auction begins now. 10.

800
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,776
Let's bid. Let's bid first and see how things go.

801
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:52,846
- We should bid more than 30 to win. - Yes, we should.

802
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,046
(They wait for others to begin first.)

803
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:55,776
- 10. - Okay. 10.

804
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,576
- 10. - Okay. Se Chan suggested 10.

805
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:58,646
- She already got it. - 20?

806
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,546
- Song Ji Hyo, 20. - You're raising too many.

807
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:01,576
30.

808
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:03,376
- It's rising too fast. - 30?

809
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:04,606
Min Ho suggested 30.

810
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,676
- 35. - 35 is suggested.

811
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:09,246
- You have to open your bag. - Don't forget it.

812
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,646
- 40. - There is 40.

813
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:13,306
- 40? - You have to open your bag.

814
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,346
45.

815
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:17,446
- 45? - Don't forget it.

816
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:19,776
Should we open our bags if we fail?

817
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,706
- 48. - Here is 48.

818
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:24,746
(What did you say?)

819
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,246
Please consult me in advance.

820
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,646
- 49. - What?

821
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,146
(They don't communicate.)

822
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:34,146
Min Ho's 49 is the highest.

823
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:36,046
- 50. - Here is 50.

824
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:37,746
- 50? - 60.

825
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:38,776
(She says 60.)

826
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:40,646
- What? - Gosh.

827
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,106
The highest if Do Yeon's 60.

828
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,506
I'll suggest 61.

829
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,646
- Hey. - This is insane.

830
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:49,846
Is there anyone else? 61 is the highest now.

831
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:51,046
Somebody needs to accept this.

832
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:52,876
No one accepts this.

833
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:54,076
Did I succeed?

834
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,576
If there is no one, we'll close it.

835
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,506
I'll give a chance to bid only to one team.

836
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:01,346
- This is nerve-wrecking. - It is.

837
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:02,976
- Now, it's 61. - 61.

838
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,006
- It's the highest now. - It won't do.

839
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:08,046
(Will this be finalised?)

840
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:09,906
Before I count...

841
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:10,946
70.

842
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:12,576
(She bids 70 without fear.)

843
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,276
Did she say 70?

844
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:17,376
- You can't change it. - What's wrong?

845
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:20,146
- If it's 61... - Do it yourself then.

846
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,206
There are 62, 63, 64 and so on above 61.

847
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,646
(My avatar is talkative.)

848
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,276
Even a machine can't do that much.

849
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:29,546
Jang Do Yeon bid the highest so far.

850
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,546
It's 70. Is there anyone else?

851
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:33,246
This is crazy. We can't bid any more.

852
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:36,946
I'll shout the price three times before we finalise it.

853
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,206
70, 70,

854
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,446
70.

855
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,746
Wait. 71.

856
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:47,046
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo bid 71.)

857
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:48,306
Why did you go so far?

858
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,376
(The bid was like a buzzer beater.)

859
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,406
I thought she called something much bigger.

860
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:55,076
Song Ji Hyo's 71 is the highest now.

861
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,046
Kwang Soo, you have to succeed in splitting them.

862
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:00,246
It's 71 now. Will you bid more?

863
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:01,846
- Don't bid any more. - Don't.

864
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,246
71.

865
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,476
(They're anxious.)

866
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:06,576
I'll bid 80.

867
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:08,746
(He bids 80.)

868
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:09,746
(She's surprised.)

869
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:13,346
Come on, come on. Kwang Soo, come on.

870
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:15,276
It's better to open the bag.

871
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,406
- Come on. - Come on.

872
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:19,106
How can I make 80 pieces?

873
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,546
I'll finalise this after shouting 80 three times.

874
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:22,546
80.

875
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:26,746
(He challenged Kwang Soo.)

876
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:29,546
(Should I take that challenge or not?)

877
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:31,776
81.

878
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,346
(She throws 81.)

879
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,646
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo bid 81.)

880
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:38,746
- It was our strategy. - Here is 81.

881
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,046
Why did you accept this?

882
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:44,406
If you bid 82, you'll have a chance to challenge.

883
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,576
- Do you want to bid 82? - She's so good.

884
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:48,546
Gosh. We need to go.

885
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:51,206
- How many? - Now, it's 81.

886
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:52,746
- Is she taking this? - You'll have a chance to challenge.

887
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:54,276
(They're waging a war of nerves.)

888
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:56,676
85.

889
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:57,906
(Jong Kook and Do Yeon bid 85.)

890
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:01,016
- 85? - Here is 85.

891
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:02,546
(They bid 85 to give away the bomb.)

892
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:04,306
I'll shout the number three times and close it.

893
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:05,306
85,

894
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:06,516
85...

895
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,946
(Jong Kook will have a chance to challenge in this situation.)

896
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:14,516
(Will it be finalised?)

897
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,246
85. It's auctioned off.

898
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,546
(They bid 85 successfully.)

899
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:20,546
Let's see.

900
00:34:20,546 --> 00:34:23,346
I've seen that on TV...

901
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:25,146
- but it's impossible. - Is it?

902
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,376
- Is this impossible? - Muscles are useless.

903
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:29,846
- Our strategy worked. - Yes, it worked.

904
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:32,516
- 85? - Wow, is this it?

905
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:34,346
- 85? - Wow, is this it?

906
00:34:34,346 --> 00:34:35,546
(85 bananas come in.)

907
00:34:36,046 --> 00:34:39,146
They're not ripe yet.

908
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:41,206
I think he can do it.

909
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,676
He can squeeze and split them.

910
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,676
You need to split 85 of them in a minute.

911
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,976
- Jong Kook will challenge. - You need to break 4 in 3 seconds.

912
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:50,516
Jong Kook will challenge.

913
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,946
(Come on, bananas.)

914
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:52,946
You can do it.

915
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,146
(I'll wish for your success.)

916
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:58,146
(He's glaring.)

917
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,606
Start.

918
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,276
(He starts to split 85 bananas in a minute.)

919
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,476
You're fast. Good.

920
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:04,876
He's doomed.

921
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:07,046
- No. He's doing well. - He's so fast.

922
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,806
No. Tear them all.

923
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:11,246
Monkeys will be sad to see this.

924
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:13,306
- Let's blend them later. - He is really fast.

925
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:14,446
- He is fast. - He can make it.

926
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:15,876
- He is so quick. - Good job.

927
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,516
- Great. - You can make it.

928
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,146
He may get cramps in her fingers.

929
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,946
If there were 80 of them, it would be possible but...

930
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,016
Well...

931
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:23,746
- They're slippery. - There are many left.

932
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,746
Did he split 20?

933
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:27,806
- I think he can do it. - It is possible.

934
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:30,406
- It's because he's Jong Kook. - It's like a circus.

935
00:35:30,406 --> 00:35:31,446
He can do it.

936
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:33,046
30 seconds have passed.

937
00:35:33,046 --> 00:35:34,446
Bravo.

938
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:37,546
- I think he can finish it. - I think so, too.

939
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,476
- Gosh. - Goodness.

940
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:41,706
- He looks like a monster. - How can he do this?

941
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:44,046
- Even monkeys can't do that. - Did you call him a monster?

942
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:45,376
- He's a machine. - Since he's so good.

943
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,306
- How many seconds have passed? - 40 seconds.

944
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,906
He must be thinking of this as exercise.

945
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,646
(There are only a few left.)

946
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:53,446
(Cheer up, my avatar.)

947
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,906
- We don't know the result yet. - As time goes on,

948
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,106
- Jong Kook is getting tired. - You can do it.

949
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,576
(For my owner and...)

950
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:03,906
(to pass the bomb to others...)

951
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:04,946
It's okay.

952
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,206
(It's exciting.)

953
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:08,546
Jong Kook is getting tired, too.

954
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:11,376
- Five minutes are left. - Five minutes.

955
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:14,016
Everyone, get ready to laugh.

956
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,206
It's a failure.

957
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,746
(He fails to split the bananas.)

958
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,546
(They burst into laughter.)

959
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,576
(He can't split the bananas.)

960
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:24,306
- He is a fool - He is a fool

961
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,306
It's party time.

962
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:28,076
That was impossible.

963
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,946
This was impossible.

964
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:34,576
As you went over 40,

965
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:37,106
- your speed got reduced. - Right.

966
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,376
- It was good exercise. - If Jong Kook failed, we can't...

967
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:42,516
My master will eat those bananas.

968
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:46,606
I'll challenge to eat 85 of bananas.

969
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,306
You challenge to eat them?

970
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,406
(Kim Joon Hyun's Top 3 Chef King)

971
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,046
(Come here, bananas.)

972
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:53,146
Let's share the bananas.

973
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:55,806
- Okay. - With the staff, too.

974
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,076
It's a banana festival.

975
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:58,906
- It's really a banana festival. - Yes.

976
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,746
Let's share with the staff.

977
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,946
You can't succeed alone.

978
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:07,146
Unfortunately, Jong Kook's challenge turned out to be a failure.

979
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,276
(Their challenge has failed.)

980
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,646
(It serves you right.)

981
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:16,276
Because he failed, he has to open one of his bags.

982
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:18,146
There is a bomb in either on of the bags.

983
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,646
- Pick one. - I'll pick the bag on the right.

984
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:22,306
- I'll pick the right, too. - Shall we pick this?

985
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,346
- Let's pick this one. - Okay.

986
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:26,246
(Jong Kook, you're doomed.)

987
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,246
Please open it.

988
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:30,046
(What will there be in the bag?)

989
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:32,746
(It should not be a bomb.)

990
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:34,546
Is it a bomb?

991
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:36,676
(It's a bomb.)

992
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:39,946
It's a bomb.

993
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:41,546
(Location of the bomb is revealed.)

994
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,846
- Wow, bomb. - Bam.

995
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,476
But if Jong Kook comes first place, we're over.

996
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,776
- Then we'll be doomed. - Right.

997
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,746
We need to block them completely.

998
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:55,046
Now, we'll begin the second auction.

999
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:57,046
- Okay. - All right.

1000
00:37:57,046 --> 00:38:01,246
This time, the owners will challenge...

1001
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,516
and the avatars will bid.

1002
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,646
I'll let you know the next game.

1003
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:07,946
It's splitting the wooden chopsticks this time.

1004
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:09,206
- What? - Did it change?

1005
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,846
The second game is splitting wooden chopsticks.

1006
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,946
I can split it even with my bottom since I'm a comedienne.

1007
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,846
My master can do that, too.

1008
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,016
Can she?

1009
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:22,676
- Excuse me? - Really?

1010
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:25,516
You can do that.

1011
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:27,546
- I can't. - She's upset.

1012
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:28,776
She is upset.

1013
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,106
My body remembers splitting chopsticks very well.

1014
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:35,646
The time limit is 1 minute and we'll start from 10.

1015
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,406
- 20. - Let's start the auction.

1016
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:38,576
- 20. - I'll take 20.

1017
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:40,206
- 30. - It's 30 now.

1018
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,346
60.

1019
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,776
Hey, you're not supposed to do that.

1020
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:47,276
- Haven't you bid? - Get out.

1021
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:49,146
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - You haven't bid, have you?

1022
00:38:49,646 --> 00:38:51,546
You'll be kicked out if you're like that.

1023
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:52,846
Why are you making the game so hard?

1024
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,606
Don't you think we can do 200?

1025
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:56,876
- We can do 60. - Look at this, Kwang Soo.

1026
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:59,046
You said you could do it but why are you silent?

1027
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,476
How long have you been on variety shows?

1028
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,646
Gosh!

1029
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:05,946
- You deserved that. - Wait.

1030
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:07,746
Do I have to hear that from a young boy?

1031
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:10,346
He's been on Running Man for years.

1032
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:12,476
You just destroyed the foundation of this auction.

1033
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,946
- Right. - Use your head.

1034
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:16,046
Why do you think we're here?

1035
00:39:16,046 --> 00:39:19,606
To be more careful, let's go up one by one from now.

1036
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,346
- That's how it should be. - One by one.

1037
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:22,846
Why are you doing this to me, too?

1038
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:26,246
- I'll bid 53. - I'll take 53.

1039
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:27,646
- 54. - 54.

1040
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,376
- I'll go with 55. - It 55.

1041
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,046
60... No.

1042
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:34,206
She said to go up one by one.

1043
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,906
So we can't skip numbers?

1044
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,246
Didn't you hear what she said?

1045
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:39,576
Is he a fool?

1046
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:41,946
(The prince of Asia became a fool.)

1047
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,946
- It suits him. - You're a fool.

1048
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,606
- What are you talking about? - You're like a fool.

1049
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,476
Fools usually look skinny like him.

1050
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,206
He looks a little bit dumb.

1051
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:53,276
- Did you say I look dumb? - A fool suits him better.

1052
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:55,446
- Let's restart. - Let's go.

1053
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:58,676
It's now 55. You can bid 56.

1054
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:01,306
- Do you want to bid 56? - 56.

1055
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,306
- 56. - Haha bid 56.

1056
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:05,146
I can do 56.

1057
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:06,846
It's 56.

1058
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:09,606
I think they're doing that to raise the number.

1059
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,146
I'll shout the number three times.

1060
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,446
- 56, - Let's finish it.

1061
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:13,446
- 56. - It's over.

1062
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,206
- It's over. - 57.

1063
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,646
- I was going to bid. - 58.

1064
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:20,246
Jong Kook bid 58. Is there anyone who want 59?

1065
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:23,016
Are there more? It's now 58.

1066
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:25,446
- 60! - Hey!

1067
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:27,646
(He bids 60.)

1068
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:28,676
Hey, fool.

1069
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,606
- We're going up. - We can't call 60 now.

1070
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,206
I don't understand why I can't call 60.

1071
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,876
- 60 is... - Why not?

1072
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,306
60 is a tabooed number.

1073
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:39,876
Why is it tabooed?

1074
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:42,176
Hey, fool, I'll give it to you. So just go home.

1075
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,046
- Don't call me a fool. - Go home.

1076
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:45,646
I can't believe this.

1077
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:50,146
Kwang Soo bid 60, the highest number.

1078
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:52,476
Don't you want to try to bid?

1079
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:54,516
- 64. - He said 64.

1080
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:56,206
- I'll go with 65. - It's 65.

1081
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:57,346
- Now, it's 65. - Wait a minute.

1082
00:40:58,046 --> 00:40:59,176
(My master will take 66.)

1083
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,376
My master will take 66.

1084
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,876
- Isn't that too many? - They said 66.

1085
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,376
Isn't Ji Hye shocked?

1086
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:08,406
Ji Hye will try 66 pairs.

1087
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:09,976
- Let's have them open the bag. - Okay.

1088
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:12,076
- Okay. - Let's take a look.

1089
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:13,946
All right, let's go.

1090
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:16,546
- Let's go. - If there's no one else,

1091
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:17,776
we close at 66.

1092
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,346
66? 66?

1093
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:22,706
It's sold at 66.

1094
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,446
You can do it.

1095
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:26,906
No, she can't.

1096
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:29,606
These are harder to grip than bananas.

1097
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:31,606
How you grip the chopsticks is important.

1098
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:32,646
Okay.

1099
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:35,106
It's Ji Hye's chopsticks show.

1100
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:37,406
- She won't make it. - It seems difficult.

1101
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:39,146
It gets tiring after a while.

1102
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:42,516
- Jae Seok's final bid was 66. - Right.

1103
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:46,676
Ji Hye must split 66 pairs of chopsticks to succeed.

1104
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,906
Just concentrate on doing this.

1105
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:51,976
It gets tiring after a while.

1106
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,776
(Will they win the bag of gold?)

1107
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:56,206
Please start.

1108
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:57,406
Start.

1109
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:58,706
(Separating 66 pairs of chopsticks starts.)

1110
00:41:58,706 --> 00:41:59,746
She's fast.

1111
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:04,376
- Keep going. - Goodness.

1112
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:06,646
- Give it to me properly. - Goodness.

1113
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:09,206
Did you hear what she just said?

1114
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:11,946
- "Give it to me properly." - What are you doing?

1115
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,446
- Hold the bottom. - What are you doing right now?

1116
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:17,946
- Hold the bottom of the chopsticks. - Did you hear what she said?

1117
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:19,706
- "What are you doing right now?" - Hurry up.

1118
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,776
- Hurry and give them to me. - Don't hold the top.

1119
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:24,746
- Split them from the bottom. - Do a better job, Jae Seok.

1120
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,246
- Split them from the bottom. - Goodness.

1121
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:29,306
(They're growing apart like the separated chopsticks.)

1122
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:32,406
- Jae Seok needs to do better. - It's okay, don't worry.

1123
00:42:32,406 --> 00:42:33,706
We can do it.

1124
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:35,646
We can do it.

1125
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:37,546
- We're quick enough. - Only 30 seconds passed.

1126
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,906
- They might make it. - It's possible.

1127
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:41,476
Don't worry. We'll make it.

1128
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,076
- 30 seconds remain. - We'll make it.

1129
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:44,976
I'm absolutely positive.

1130
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:47,546
- I told you this was possible. - They're almost done.

1131
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:49,876
We can do it. We can do it.

1132
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,676
We can do it.

1133
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,206
(Will their wish turn into a miracle?)

1134
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:56,106
- They're almost done. - We can do it.

1135
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,706
(They have less than 10 pairs left.)

1136
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:01,246
- We can do it. - In 9, 8...

1137
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,046
- We can do it. - In 7, 6, 5...

1138
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:09,476
(What will be the result of this battle?)

1139
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:12,406
- In 2, 1. - Just a little more.

1140
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:16,246
(With remaining five pairs, they fail.)

1141
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:20,046
(They were so close.)

1142
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:22,276
(Someone's failure makes others happy.)

1143
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:24,176
I want to see someone succeed.

1144
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:27,016
Why didn't you hand them to me properly?

1145
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,806
- Ji Hye's mood changed a lot. - I saw that, too.

1146
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:31,246
She has a short temper.

1147
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:32,906
(She's very angry.)

1148
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:35,046
Did you see her do this?

1149
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,906
(Throwing away the chopsticks)

1150
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:38,076
She did it at the end.

1151
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:41,076
- In 2, 1. - Just a little more.

1152
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,746
(We're doomed.)

1153
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:45,576
Gosh, we were so close.

1154
00:43:45,576 --> 00:43:48,106
Let's see what's in their bag.

1155
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:49,306
(It's time to see inside their bag.)

1156
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:52,306
- I want to see someone succeed. - This is fun.

1157
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:54,406
I bet there's something inside one of the bags.

1158
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:56,046
I think so, too.

1159
00:43:56,046 --> 00:43:58,106
- I think one of them has gold. - I bet there's gold inside.

1160
00:43:58,106 --> 00:43:59,476
Show us the front.

1161
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:00,946
(He'll open one of the bags.)

1162
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:03,376
- Jae Seok. - There are some scratches.

1163
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:05,076
Look at this.

1164
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,306
There are scratches because they changed the stickers.

1165
00:44:08,306 --> 00:44:10,606
The sticker on that bag changed, right?

1166
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:12,076
- It's this one. - That's the one.

1167
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:13,846
It's that bag.

1168
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:17,646
(One of the bags has gold. There must be something inside.)

1169
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,606
(The bag is empty.)

1170
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:25,576
Goodness.

1171
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:28,346
There's something inside the bag on the left.

1172
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:30,006
I'm sure there is something.

1173
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:32,776
Didn't Jae Seok's team change the bag?

1174
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:35,446
(He got lucky and avoided opening his bag with gold.)

1175
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:38,406
This is today's last auction.

1176
00:44:38,446 --> 00:44:40,976
This auction is a game category...

1177
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,746
which the master and his avatar...

1178
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,406
- play together. - Come on.

1179
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:47,346
- Let's do it. - It's "Couple Jump Ropes".

1180
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,846
It's "Couple Jump Ropes".

1181
00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:51,876
We did this often when we were young.

1182
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:53,176
How will it turn out?

1183
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,706
- You should try it once. - Shall we give it a try?

1184
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:57,746
I bet Min Ho is good at it.

1185
00:44:58,106 --> 00:44:59,506
Get ready, start.

1186
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:01,806
(Min Ho and Gary try jumping the rope.)

1187
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:04,676
- They'll make it. - This is possible.

1188
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:08,006
(Their movement is swift like a butterfly.)

1189
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:11,106
(Despite their drastically different looks, they have good chemistry.)

1190
00:45:11,106 --> 00:45:13,406
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - Do it as if you're doing it alone.

1191
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,446
- Look at them. - In 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1192
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:18,146
They're good.

1193
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:19,876
Gosh.

1194
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,476
Min Ho's team can do it.

1195
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:24,976
(Let's show them what we can do.)

1196
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,776
- They're good, too. - 13, 14, 15...

1197
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,606
16, 17, 18.

1198
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:33,106
Why did you trip?

1199
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,106
(Why did you trip?)

1200
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:37,676
He should have done better.

1201
00:45:38,346 --> 00:45:39,876
She complains a lot.

1202
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:42,876
There's something wrong with her personality.

1203
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:44,446
My master is...

1204
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:46,106
- a little... - She's somewhat upset.

1205
00:45:46,106 --> 00:45:47,276
She's upset.

1206
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:49,976
You had enough time to practise.

1207
00:45:49,976 --> 00:45:52,646
Now, we'll start the auction.

1208
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,106
We start at three.

1209
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:56,206
Let's start at three.

1210
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:59,206
- Four. - Seok Jin called four.

1211
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,246
- Six. - Haha called five.

1212
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:02,746
Ji Hyo called six.

1213
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:03,746
Nine.

1214
00:46:03,946 --> 00:46:05,776
- Haha called nine. - It's dangerous.

1215
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:07,646
- We can do 9, can't we? - 11.

1216
00:46:07,776 --> 00:46:09,506
- 12. - We have 12.

1217
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:11,006
- 13. - We have 13.

1218
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:12,306
- 14. - 14?

1219
00:46:12,446 --> 00:46:13,706
I say 20.

1220
00:46:13,706 --> 00:46:15,906
- 20? Okay, I accept. - 30.

1221
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,676
- The highest bid currently is 30. - Let's call 30.

1222
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:20,476
I'm warning you, but we won't give up this game.

1223
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,576
We'll play it no matter what.

1224
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:24,106
During the simulation...

1225
00:46:25,676 --> 00:46:27,806
- You seem nervous. - I'm sorry. Let's take a break.

1226
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:30,446
- He's already nervous. - Pardon me.

1227
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:33,106
Seok Jin, you seem quite nervous.

1228
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:37,176
During the simulation, we jumped the rope 18 times.

1229
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:39,506
- 41. - Min Ho should try.

1230
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,746
- 41. - We have 41.

1231
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:43,776
- Min Ho will try no matter what. - What should we do?

1232
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:45,976
He should give it a try.

1233
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,846
- Se Chan? - 42.

1234
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,306
We have 42. Will you try 43, Min Ho?

1235
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:52,006
- Will you try 43? - 43.

1236
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:53,806
- 43. - I accept 43.

1237
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:55,346
43 is the highest bid.

1238
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:56,946
(Please stop Min Ho for me.)

1239
00:46:57,006 --> 00:46:58,606
Min Ho will try no matter what.

1240
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:01,176
I think it's a competition of these two teams.

1241
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:05,006
Ji Seok's team is trying for fun, but Min Ho's team is likely to win.

1242
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:07,806
My heart is pounding because I'm so nervous.

1243
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:10,606
Here's our final decision.

1244
00:47:11,446 --> 00:47:12,506
I call 50.

1245
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:13,946
I call 50.

1246
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:15,876
- 50? - Yes.

1247
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,176
Is 50 the last call?

1248
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:20,346
- I think Min Ho will do it. - Is it 50?

1249
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,406
- Is Min Ho not going for it? - Min Ho should give it a try.

1250
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,776
This is your last chance. Is the final call 50?

1251
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:27,706
(You're going for it, right?)

1252
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,746
(What will be Min Ho's move?)

1253
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,546
It's sold at 50.

1254
00:47:34,576 --> 00:47:36,776
(Se Chan and Seok Jin have to try 50 jumps together.)

1255
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:38,276
- Wait. - Min Ho.

1256
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:40,006
- Min Ho won't do it? - Why not?

1257
00:47:40,006 --> 00:47:41,506
You've done boxing before.

1258
00:47:42,146 --> 00:47:43,806
It's been 10 years since I've done boxing.

1259
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:45,576
He has a bad knee.

1260
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,706
How can he jump 50 times with his knee?

1261
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:50,406
It'd be hilarious if he trips on the first jump.

1262
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:51,476
That would be amazing.

1263
00:47:51,906 --> 00:47:53,346
- Can you leave glasses on? - They get in the way.

1264
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,376
- You look ugly without them. - They get in the way.

1265
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,206
(He trips immediately.)

1266
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:02,546
Stop it, please.

1267
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,946
He should be able to jump at least once by himself.

1268
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:06,446
My goodness.

1269
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:08,806
How can they jump 50 when he can't jump 5 times?

1270
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,746
Let's try it without the rope.

1271
00:48:10,746 --> 00:48:11,946
Let's practise.

1272
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:17,376
(Not in sync)

1273
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:19,846
- What was that? - Were they on a seesaw?

1274
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:22,146
I thought they were on a seesaw.

1275
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,646
- I thought so, too. - Let's make an eye contact.

1276
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:26,276
(Their practice time is up.)

1277
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:27,846
Stay with my pace.

1278
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,646
It'd be hilarious if they trip on their second jump.

1279
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:32,246
I'm sorry, Ma'am,

1280
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,006
but may we start when we're ready?

1281
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:35,106
Of course.

1282
00:48:35,106 --> 00:48:38,346
- Why would you apologise? - Why is that important?

1283
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:40,506
- We'll start ourselves. - I'm not used to being called.

1284
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:42,076
- Please count our jumps. - Okay.

1285
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:45,076
- You can do it. - We can do it.

1286
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:46,846
Let's do it.

1287
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:48,706
Who's the master?

1288
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:49,876
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1289
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,946
- Let's do it. - We can do it.

1290
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:56,246
(Master...)

1291
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:59,146
(Avatar...)

1292
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:03,846
(We can do it.)

1293
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,246
It's like "Dad's Challenge".

1294
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:09,376
Are you naming this?

1295
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:10,746
"Dad's Challenge"?

1296
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,606
- You can do it, Dad. - Go, Dad.

1297
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:15,146
- Let's go. - Let's start.

1298
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:16,346
I bet they'll make three jumps.

1299
00:49:16,346 --> 00:49:17,946
(How funny will they be?)

1300
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,876
- It's making me nervous. - Let's give it a try now.

1301
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,546
(Let's give it a serious try.)

1302
00:49:24,306 --> 00:49:26,546
- We can do it. - Let's do it.

1303
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:28,676
(A golden opportunity to earn the bag of gold.)

1304
00:49:29,846 --> 00:49:32,706
- Let's start. Get ready. - Let's go.

1305
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:35,176
(They start their "Couple Jump Ropes".)

1306
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:39,406
Two, three, four...

1307
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,146
- Six, seven. - No one predicted correctly.

1308
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:43,906
(They jump in sync.)

1309
00:49:43,906 --> 00:49:45,346
- What's going on? - 10.

1310
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:46,906
(Goodness)

1311
00:49:46,906 --> 00:49:49,046
Don't push me down too much.

1312
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:50,906
(Everyone is in a daze.)

1313
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:54,076
Don't push me down.

1314
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:56,406
Don't push me down.

1315
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:58,846
- Don't push me down. - 17, 18.

1316
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:00,406
(He tripped.)

1317
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:04,006
(Screaming)

1318
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:06,976
- They jumped many times. - It was your fault.

1319
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:09,076
You pushed me down too much.

1320
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,706
Se Chan tripped on the rope,

1321
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:13,276
but Seok Jin pushed him down.

1322
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,776
- Really? - Se Chan couldn't jump.

1323
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:17,576
- They're quite good. - You should have resisted.

1324
00:50:18,006 --> 00:50:20,246
Are you kidding me?

1325
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:22,076
Let's see what's in their bag.

1326
00:50:22,076 --> 00:50:23,446
Which one shall I open?

1327
00:50:23,446 --> 00:50:26,476
They might have a bomb in one of the bags.

1328
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:28,246
We should have succeeded.

1329
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:30,076
- This bag. - This one?

1330
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,306
- Do they have something in the bag? - I don't think so.

1331
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,446
I bet they have a bomb.

1332
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:35,806
Let's see.

1333
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:37,346
If not, it's in Kwang Soo's.

1334
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,706
Here you go.

1335
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:40,406
- There's nothing inside. - Okay.

1336
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:41,946
Good job in hiding it.

1337
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:44,106
- He sounds so strange. - I know.

1338
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:46,946
- What he said sounds so fake. - Kwang Soo is good at guessing.

1339
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:48,876
I'm quite observant.

1340
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:51,876
I keep imagining Kwang Soo with his nose running.

1341
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:54,146
What are you talking about?

1342
00:50:54,146 --> 00:50:55,806
That's so funny.

1343
00:50:55,806 --> 00:51:00,476
All right. The auction for "My Avatar Can" is over.

1344
00:51:00,606 --> 00:51:03,006
- That was fun. - I wish you luck.

1345
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,506
- See you next time. - Thank you.

1346
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:07,606
Can we do that again?

1347
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,206
- That was so fun. - I want to do that again.

1348
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,076
(2 hours later)

1349
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:16,106
- We will now begin the death match. - This is making me nervous.

1350
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,846
(They'll fight over the bomb in a game of wits.)

1351
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:19,876
Get yourself together.

1352
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,306
(There are twists after twists.)

1353
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:22,906
Is there another twist?

1354
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:25,906
(How will this cruel race of masters and avatars end?)

1355
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:28,806
(2 hours ago)

1356
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:32,476
This round is called, "Find the Right Card".

1357
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:37,076
Avatars have to make their way through the obstacles of the track.

1358
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:41,376
Before the match starts, the masters will play a game to win cards.

1359
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:44,906
They can remove the obstacles according to the cards they win.

1360
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:48,446
The difficulty of the race...

1361
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:51,376
depends on how many cards the masters gain.

1362
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:55,346
If the avatar comes in first place,

1363
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,506
the team is given the opportunity to exchange bags.

1364
00:51:58,706 --> 00:52:00,046
Some of the cards are misspelled.

1365
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:02,346
- What? - Some are misspelled.

1366
00:52:02,346 --> 00:52:04,106
(They need to look for cards that are typed correctly.)

1367
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:05,106
I see.

1368
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,376
If you get a card that reads, "Hurdles",

1369
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,276
they'll remove it from the race.

1370
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:10,346
(What?)

1371
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:12,476
My master...

1372
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:14,776
gets upset easily, but she's really slow.

1373
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:17,046
Does she have any good traits?

1374
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:19,376
She said she was worried.

1375
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:23,576
"Don't you think I'm coming off too strong?"

1376
00:52:23,776 --> 00:52:25,976
"How do you think I should behave?"

1377
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,146
She's like a little girl.

1378
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:29,206
I think it's too late for a change.

1379
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:30,376
It's too late now.

1380
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:31,906
So I said,

1381
00:52:31,906 --> 00:52:32,906
"It's too late today."

1382
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,806
- It's too late to go back now. - Was she that bad?

1383
00:52:35,806 --> 00:52:37,246
You should try again next time.

1384
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:39,646
She said she's usually not like this.

1385
00:52:39,646 --> 00:52:41,906
I could sense anger from her face.

1386
00:52:42,046 --> 00:52:44,246
She's a nice person, but she has a personality disorder.

1387
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:46,206
- At least she's nice. - That's right.

1388
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:48,446
She's a nice person.

1389
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:51,076
(They put on sticky pants to get the cards.)

1390
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:53,206
You should take those pants home when you go home.

1391
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:55,206
- You look good. - He does.

1392
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,806
Are you from Anyang?

1393
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,706
Don't I look like a gangster?

1394
00:52:58,706 --> 00:52:59,876
You do.

1395
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,446
- Look at that. - Are you...

1396
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:03,146
Are you a gangster from Anyang?

1397
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,106
Let's go, Master!

1398
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:09,006
I have faith in you, Ji Hyo. I want a path of flowers!

1399
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:11,746
(I'm counting on you to give me a path of flowers.)

1400
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:13,446
You can count on me.

1401
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:16,876
Look at all the cards.

1402
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:19,106
You have to get the correct one.

1403
00:53:19,106 --> 00:53:20,306
I see it.

1404
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,846
I see one.

1405
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:23,576
I see it there.

1406
00:53:23,776 --> 00:53:24,906
What's that one?

1407
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,906
Hey, Ji Hye.

1408
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,406
(What am I supposed to be doing again?)

1409
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,976
You have to get the correct ones.

1410
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:33,046
(You can count on me, Kwang Soo.)

1411
00:53:33,746 --> 00:53:35,776
- I want a path of flowers. - Did you see that?

1412
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,646
- I see hurdles. - There are lots.

1413
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:39,906
- You have to think fast. - Get the pressure board.

1414
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:41,806
- You can go now. - Let's go.

1415
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:42,806
("Find the Right Card" begins.)

1416
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:46,546
(It's a dance-off.)

1417
00:53:46,546 --> 00:53:47,846
What's that dance?

1418
00:53:47,846 --> 00:53:51,276
Min Ho can dance to this.

1419
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:53,406
Look at Min Ho.

1420
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:56,376
Look at him go.

1421
00:53:57,346 --> 00:53:59,276
Se Chan, copy Min Ho's dance.

1422
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:01,346
(I can do that, too.)

1423
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:02,476
That's good, Min Ho.

1424
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:05,376
- I wish I could dance like that. - He looks so cool.

1425
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,876
- He's good. - Nice, Min Ho.

1426
00:54:08,876 --> 00:54:10,476
Why aren't you dancing, Master?

1427
00:54:10,476 --> 00:54:12,106
- Acupressure plates. - Acupressure plates.

1428
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:13,806
(The first word is "acupressure plates".)

1429
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:16,006
(I got this.)

1430
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:17,646
Push them over.

1431
00:54:17,646 --> 00:54:19,676
(He comes charging in.)

1432
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:20,676
There you go.

1433
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:22,046
(She gets pushed aside.)

1434
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:25,906
(Looks like Min Ho found something in the middle of the chaos.)

1435
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:27,676
- Way to go, Ji Hye. - Ji Hyo!

1436
00:54:27,706 --> 00:54:29,206
(Ji Hye is good at everything.)

1437
00:54:30,206 --> 00:54:31,776
- Ji Hyo! - It's over here.

1438
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,046
- It's over here. - That's not the right one.

1439
00:54:35,046 --> 00:54:36,646
We got it.

1440
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:39,146
It's over there, Se Chan. She has it.

1441
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,446
- Do Yeon has it. - I got it.

1442
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,446
- Push them away. - It's on Do Yeon's bottom.

1443
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,906
- It's on her bottom. - Get up.

1444
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,146
(Ji Hye doesn't give up easily.)

1445
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:48,406
Way to go, Ji Hye.

1446
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:51,146
- Ji Hyo! - You're doing well, Ji Hye.

1447
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:52,606
- Ji Hyo! - It's over here!

1448
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:54,306
(It's right in front of Ji Hye.)

1449
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:56,076
(Ji Hyo comes charging in.)

1450
00:54:56,446 --> 00:54:58,046
(Good job, Ji Hyo.)

1451
00:54:58,046 --> 00:54:59,046
- We did it! - That's not the right one.

1452
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,376
- We did it! - Where did it go?

1453
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:02,076
- Where is it? - Take the card off now.

1454
00:55:02,076 --> 00:55:03,276
(Ji Hyo's team no longer has acupressure plates.)

1455
00:55:03,276 --> 00:55:05,806
(This one isn't spelled correctly.)

1456
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,176
(So close, yet so far.)

1457
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:09,446
- Gosh. - Okay!

1458
00:55:09,446 --> 00:55:11,576
(That's right, isn't it?)

1459
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:12,746
It's wrong?

1460
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,776
Min Ho.

1461
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:17,146
(Get it together, Master.)

1462
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,906
I think there's one more.

1463
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:21,976
There were two cards.

1464
00:55:21,976 --> 00:55:23,046
(Min Ho gets one as well.)

1465
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:26,306
You got one, too?

1466
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:27,806
- Are you serious? - This is turning out nicely.

1467
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:29,446
Is there one more, then?

1468
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:31,506
- It's over? - It's done?

1469
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:32,946
Who got it?

1470
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:34,806
Master, it's over.

1471
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:36,876
Get up, Master.

1472
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,146
(She's disappointed.)

1473
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:40,276
I couldn't find it.

1474
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:42,676
My master is...

1475
00:55:43,046 --> 00:55:46,046
always driven, but she's so bad at games.

1476
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:47,976
- She didn't win anything today. - Right.

1477
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:50,776
If you have anger issues, you won't be able to find it.

1478
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:53,046
It's not like we're the ones going on the race.

1479
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:55,006
We're doing this for the avatars, right?

1480
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:58,176
Can I choose not to do this if I want obstacles for him?

1481
00:55:58,606 --> 00:55:59,676
Is that how it is?

1482
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:00,976
(What's she on about this time?)

1483
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:03,746
Master, you're so slow at the start.

1484
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:04,776
I'm sorry.

1485
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:06,046
Get your head in the game.

1486
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:09,306
- I'm sorry. - You were just standing there.

1487
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:10,346
I'll try harder.

1488
00:56:10,346 --> 00:56:12,206
- This is your last chance. - Okay.

1489
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,106
- Stop disappointing me. - I'm sorry.

1490
00:56:14,106 --> 00:56:15,446
(Haha teases his kind master.)

1491
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:17,676
(Who is the master here?)

1492
00:56:18,146 --> 00:56:20,446
- I'm counting on you, Master. - Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1493
00:56:20,446 --> 00:56:22,776
- Let's do this. - Yes, let's go.

1494
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:24,546
I don't see anything that says "Puddles".

1495
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:26,146
I don't wants puddles.

1496
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:30,446
(The second round starts.)

1497
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,476
How many are in your group?

1498
00:56:33,476 --> 00:56:34,506
It's just me and him.

1499
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:36,876
- Are you a party of three? - Yes.

1500
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:38,206
I live alone.

1501
00:56:38,206 --> 00:56:39,276
- Who does? - I do.

1502
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:40,576
Oh, really? I'll pass.

1503
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:44,176
Fruit plate for table three, please.

1504
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:45,906
(This is Running Nightclub.)

1505
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:48,006
- I have to ask you to leave. - "Plunger".

1506
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:49,506
- What? - Plunger?

1507
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,576
Plunger.

1508
00:56:50,576 --> 00:56:52,276
(They're sprinting for it.)

1509
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:53,876
Coming through.

1510
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,376
- Master! - Coming through.

1511
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,246
- What are you doing, Ji Hyo? - We can sit out on this one.

1512
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:00,276
But it's a plunger!

1513
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:02,546
So what?

1514
00:57:02,546 --> 00:57:04,146
Don't you want to win the race?

1515
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:07,506
Get away from me, all of you.

1516
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:10,676
I got it.

1517
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,106
Remove the unnecessary ones.

1518
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:14,276
Get away from me.

1519
00:57:15,076 --> 00:57:17,046
- What's the word again? - Throw away the other ones.

1520
00:57:17,046 --> 00:57:19,176
(Se Chan misses it when it's right in front of him.)

1521
00:57:19,176 --> 00:57:21,546
- Plunger? - That's not the right one.

1522
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:23,606
- Let's see here. - We have to win this race.

1523
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,146
(It's right here.)

1524
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,346
- It's over there! - There it is.

1525
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:29,376
(It's over there, Master.)

1526
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:31,946
- Hey, Ji Hye. - It's over there.

1527
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:35,276
(He eats the card with his legs.)

1528
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:38,206
(They reach between his legs.)

1529
00:57:38,806 --> 00:57:40,646
Where are you touching?

1530
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:43,546
- Where is it? - Get that.

1531
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:45,906
(Meanwhile,)

1532
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:48,906
(Ji Hye is confused with the misspelled word.)

1533
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:50,646
(This is right, isn't it?)

1534
00:57:50,646 --> 00:57:52,346
That's not it. That's not the one, Ji Hye.

1535
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:53,976
It's obviously wrong. Why is she confused?

1536
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:56,876
- Come on, Ji Hye. - Move over.

1537
00:57:57,046 --> 00:57:58,476
Go away.

1538
00:57:58,846 --> 00:57:59,906
There you go.

1539
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:03,546
(He's done it again.)

1540
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,946
He got it again.

1541
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:06,776
He found another one.

1542
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:10,446
(I want the best things for Gary.)

1543
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:14,946
(Min Ho and Gary have removed plungers from their race.)

1544
00:58:15,506 --> 00:58:16,676
Good job, Master.

1545
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:19,046
(His master is on fire.)

1546
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:20,246
Look at him.

1547
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,376
(I want to do well, too.)

1548
00:58:22,376 --> 00:58:23,476
Ji Hye, it's right over there.

1549
00:58:24,606 --> 00:58:26,006
Move over.

1550
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,646
Go away.

1551
00:58:27,646 --> 00:58:28,806
There you go.

1552
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:31,546
- Why is she confused? - There you go. You got it.

1553
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:32,906
- I got it. - Good job.

1554
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:35,476
(Did Joon Hyun get the right card?)

1555
00:58:35,476 --> 00:58:37,046
- Where did it go? - Good job, Master.

1556
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:39,146
Okay!

1557
00:58:39,146 --> 00:58:41,446
(Joon Hyun and Haha have removed plungers from their race, too.)

1558
00:58:42,176 --> 00:58:43,306
What was the word again?

1559
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:45,646
What on earth are you doing, Ji Hye?

1560
00:58:46,846 --> 00:58:48,706
- Can't you read? - Get it on your pants.

1561
00:58:48,976 --> 00:58:50,476
- Is this right? - Yes.

1562
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:52,446
- She got it. - You did it!

1563
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,906
- Wait a minute. - You did it, Ji Hye.

1564
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:56,676
- I thought this one was wrong. - We did it.

1565
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:57,846
(It's missing a letter.)

1566
00:58:57,846 --> 00:58:58,906
It's not right?

1567
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:00,546
It's misspelled.

1568
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:02,106
- Oh, really? - No, this is right.

1569
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,976
- It's incorrect. - No, this is right.

1570
00:59:05,406 --> 00:59:07,376
- Ji Hye says it's right. - It's missing a letter.

1571
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:09,376
How can you get that wrong?

1572
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:12,606
She got confused with the most obvious one, too.

1573
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:14,446
I was confused.

1574
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:15,946
What's that on your legs?

1575
00:59:17,146 --> 00:59:18,276
(She's collecting incorrect cards.)

1576
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:20,906
- What are they doing there? - She's hilarious.

1577
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:23,076
(She slaps the cards down.)

1578
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,906
(She got everything else except for the right card.)

1579
00:59:25,906 --> 00:59:27,706
- Ji Hye. - I told you it was wrong.

1580
00:59:27,706 --> 00:59:29,546
- Ji Hye is... - I told you.

1581
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:31,446
Ji Hye is about to lose it.

1582
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:33,846
Take it easy, Ji Hye.

1583
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:37,906
We have to do better than this, Ji Hyo.

1584
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:40,176
We need to exchange the bags with gold ones.

1585
00:59:40,806 --> 00:59:41,876
(Come on, Master.)

1586
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:43,006
We need to get our gold.

1587
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:45,276
What? I was just...

1588
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:47,546
We have to win the race, right?

1589
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:48,906
I'm just saying, you know?

1590
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:52,406
Why are you like this? We have to win this game.

1591
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:55,546
- What's the last one? - Puddles.

1592
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:57,346
- What? - Puddles.

1593
00:59:57,576 --> 00:59:59,176
Is it "puddles" or "poodles"?

1594
00:59:59,176 --> 01:00:00,746
- "Puddles". - Okay.

1595
01:00:00,746 --> 01:00:03,146
- There it is. - That one is misspelled.

1596
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:05,846
(She has her own way of doing things.)

1597
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:07,876
Come here, Ji Hye.

1598
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:09,876
Come here.

1599
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:12,376
(Master, I found the right card.)

1600
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:14,606
(Got it.)

1601
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,106
Isn't that cheating?

1602
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:19,106
(The third round starts.)

1603
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:21,606
(This is their last chance.)

1604
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:26,946
(Only 1 obstacle remains.)

1605
01:00:27,576 --> 01:00:28,846
(They dance vigorously.)

1606
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:29,946
You can't mess this one up.

1607
01:00:30,306 --> 01:00:34,406
(Let's remove some obstacles.)

1608
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:36,476
Let's go, Joon Hyun!

1609
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:38,646
- Puddles. - You have to do this one!

1610
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:39,706
You must get this.

1611
01:00:39,706 --> 01:00:41,246
- You have to do this one! - You have to get this one.

1612
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:42,506
- You have to do this! - Please!

1613
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:45,946
(I don't want to get wet in this cold weather.)

1614
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,906
(Joon Hyun comes charging in for the 3rd time.)

1615
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:52,746
(This fat man owns this turf!)

1616
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:54,706
(What's this?)

1617
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:56,206
(Don't get tricked.)

1618
01:00:57,106 --> 01:00:58,576
It's hiding somewhere.

1619
01:00:58,706 --> 01:01:00,806
- Ji Hye. - You must get it!

1620
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,606
- You have to get it! - You must get it.

1621
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:04,376
(Joon Hyun stays stuck to the floor.)

1622
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,476
Where is "Puddles"?

1623
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:08,446
You should look for it instead of lying down.

1624
01:01:09,276 --> 01:01:10,976
(Master, I hate water.)

1625
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:14,576
Where is it?

1626
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:16,676
Wait a minute.

1627
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:17,906
Where is "Puddles"?

1628
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:20,276
- Don't let someone else take it. - Where is it?

1629
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,176
(What? "Water Bottom"?)

1630
01:01:22,276 --> 01:01:23,676
That's "Water Bottom"!

1631
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,406
(That one is misspelled!)

1632
01:01:26,506 --> 01:01:27,706
(He gropes everywhere to search.)

1633
01:01:27,706 --> 01:01:28,946
- Ji Hyo! - Get out of the way.

1634
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:31,576
Move. How dare you touch me there?

1635
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:32,976
Ji Hye is so competitive.

1636
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:34,706
(It's a fair game.)

1637
01:01:34,706 --> 01:01:36,606
- Ji Hyo, focus on the game! - Ji Hye.

1638
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:39,006
- Please! - I think it's underneath him.

1639
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:42,976
(Everyone attacks Joon Hyun.)

1640
01:01:42,976 --> 01:01:44,406
- There you go. - Ji Hye, over here.

1641
01:01:44,406 --> 01:01:46,706
- Ji Hye, it's over there. - Grab it with your bottom.

1642
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:48,246
(She puts her hand in.)

1643
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:50,706
Go in!

1644
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:52,546
Watch where you're putting your hand.

1645
01:01:52,906 --> 01:01:55,406
- Hey, what are you doing? - Come on.

1646
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:56,976
(Grab "Puddles"!)

1647
01:01:56,976 --> 01:01:58,606
- It's stuck to your bottom. - I can't see anything.

1648
01:01:58,606 --> 01:02:00,376
It's stuck to your bottom.

1649
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:02,176
- I know. - Get out of the way.

1650
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:03,646
(I won't let you go.)

1651
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:05,606
- You shouldn't take it off. - Get out of the way.

1652
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:06,806
(You're worse than me.)

1653
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,806
- Let it go. - Please let me go.

1654
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:10,546
- Move out of the way. - Miss.

1655
01:02:10,546 --> 01:02:11,906
(Let go of his bottom.)

1656
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,476
It's already stuck to his bottom.

1657
01:02:14,476 --> 01:02:17,106
- What are you talking about? - She's trying to take it off.

1658
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:18,476
This isn't a race.

1659
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:20,776
Lying down on the floor won't help you at all.

1660
01:02:21,206 --> 01:02:22,906
(She doesn't budge.)

1661
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:23,906
Gosh.

1662
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,906
Let him go.

1663
01:02:25,906 --> 01:02:28,476
(Please take her away from him.)

1664
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:31,106
- Let's pull Ji Hye away. - She touched my bare skin.

1665
01:02:31,106 --> 01:02:34,276
- Pull her away now. - Ji Hye.

1666
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:37,046
She put it on her bottom.

1667
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:40,406
(Did Ji Hye steal the card?)

1668
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:42,646
- What on earth? - Come on.

1669
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:43,706
(She stuck many cards on her.)

1670
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:46,006
Good job, Ji Hye.

1671
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:48,276
What's the point if she stuck all the cards on her?

1672
01:02:48,276 --> 01:02:49,446
Ji Hye!

1673
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:50,906
(Ji Hye has a strong will.)

1674
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:53,276
- What's the point? - Ji Hye!

1675
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:55,776
She cheated because it was already stuck on Joon Hyun.

1676
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:58,606
- You're the best. - That's cheating.

1677
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:00,106
(We did it.)

1678
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:04,446
I'm sorry, but Ji Hye doesn't have six bottoms.

1679
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:07,806
She touched my bare skin.

1680
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:10,246
She lay down and pretended to be asleep.

1681
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:12,046
- I have to be okay. - Are you okay?

1682
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,246
My heart is beating so fast.

1683
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:16,446
Good job, Ji Hye.

1684
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:17,646
(She removes puddles for Jae Seok.)

1685
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:19,706
(Current status of "Find the Right Card")

1686
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:21,646
- Where are we? - It's based on your colour.

1687
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:25,746
- It's based on colours. - This is ours.

1688
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:27,506
You're a fool if you can't win first place.

1689
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,006
Gary's team hardly has obstacles.

1690
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:31,006
- Gosh. - This looks difficult.

1691
01:03:31,176 --> 01:03:33,606
(It's their last chance to exchange bags.)

1692
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:35,706
- My master removed... - Good luck.

1693
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:37,346
so many obstacles for me.

1694
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,076
Gary, you can do it!

1695
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:41,006
- You can do it, Jae Seok! - Good luck.

1696
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:44,146
- Seok Jin, you have a chance. - Go, Haha.

1697
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:46,346
- You can do it, Gary. - I'm sorry.

1698
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:47,646
(Gary is ready.)

1699
01:03:48,276 --> 01:03:50,706
- Get ready. - You can do it, Haha.

1700
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:53,876
(Please do well, Jae Seok.)

1701
01:03:54,806 --> 01:03:56,006
Get ready.

1702
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:59,176
(Don't worry, Master. I'll protect our gold.)

1703
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:00,176
Start.

1704
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:01,606
("Obstacle Race" starts.)

1705
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:06,206
Run, Haha. Run.

1706
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,976
(Gary gets ahead.)

1707
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,276
(Sticky trap slows down Gary and Jong Kook.)

1708
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:15,606
(Hurdles are ahead for the teams running behind.)

1709
01:04:16,446 --> 01:04:20,206
(Gary, Haha and Kwang Soo are in the lead.)

1710
01:04:21,106 --> 01:04:22,646
(They crawl quickly.)

1711
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:25,306
Go, Gary!

1712
01:04:26,406 --> 01:04:29,706
(Some avatars enter the hurdle zone.)

1713
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:35,976
(Everyone passes through the hurdles quickly.)

1714
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:39,876
(Seok Jin struggles by himself.)

1715
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,446
- You can do it. - Gosh.

1716
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:45,476
(Seok Jin's team will probably lose.)

1717
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:47,646
(Meanwhile,)

1718
01:04:48,306 --> 01:04:50,576
(Gary is moving quickly.)

1719
01:04:51,606 --> 01:04:53,706
(He enters the net at the speed of light.)

1720
01:04:54,646 --> 01:04:56,106
(Screaming)

1721
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:59,506
(Jong Kook enters the plunger zone.)

1722
01:05:00,246 --> 01:05:01,406
(They struggle.)

1723
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:05,806
(The competition remains fierce.)

1724
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:07,746
You can do it.

1725
01:05:12,906 --> 01:05:14,706
I can't enter the net.

1726
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,376
(Gary faces difficulties in the net.)

1727
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:18,806
You can do it.

1728
01:05:19,446 --> 01:05:21,476
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

1729
01:05:21,476 --> 01:05:22,546
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

1730
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:25,206
(Kwang Soo gets ahead.)

1731
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,306
(I'm glad I removed the net.)

1732
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:30,106
The net is difficult to get through.

1733
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:31,706
(Gary finally passes the net.)

1734
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:33,646
The net is difficult.

1735
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:35,076
(Without the puddles, Jae Seok moves quickly.)

1736
01:05:36,506 --> 01:05:38,906
(I won't let anyone take our bag of gold.)

1737
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:41,406
You're running first place.

1738
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:43,906
(Jae Seok moves forward.)

1739
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:49,506
(Will Gary remain first place?)

1740
01:05:49,506 --> 01:05:50,606
(Gary wins!)

1741
01:05:51,006 --> 01:05:52,006
(He's half a second ahead.)

1742
01:05:56,176 --> 01:05:57,246
That was amazing.

1743
01:05:57,246 --> 01:05:58,476
Goodness.

1744
01:05:58,706 --> 01:06:00,646
(I was so close.)

1745
01:06:01,476 --> 01:06:03,306
That net was so difficult.

1746
01:06:04,346 --> 01:06:05,746
I almost lost the race.

1747
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:07,806
You almost lost the race, Gary.

1748
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:09,406
The holes in the net were tiny.

1749
01:06:09,406 --> 01:06:11,506
Right? I could have won the race.

1750
01:06:11,546 --> 01:06:14,246
(Gary and Min Ho are given the chance to exchange bags.)

1751
01:06:14,246 --> 01:06:17,006
- There were screws on the floor. - I see.

1752
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,106
(Kwang Soo got injured.)

1753
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:19,576
It's okay.

1754
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,876
(Did my dear Kwang Soo get hurt?)

1755
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:24,506
- That's fortunate. - He's okay.

1756
01:06:24,506 --> 01:06:25,746
He got a small cut.

1757
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:29,176
- Goodness, look at that. - Ji Hyo is putting on some bandage.

1758
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:31,406
My goodness.

1759
01:06:31,406 --> 01:06:34,146
Ji Hyo is so sweet, but she can be so aggressive at times.

1760
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,446
- I don't understand her. - I'm not sure...

1761
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:37,876
- what kind of person she is. - I don't understand her.

1762
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:39,806
She's sweet right now.

1763
01:06:39,806 --> 01:06:41,706
My mum is fickle about her, too.

1764
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:43,906
(Ji Hyo is very fickle.)

1765
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:47,476
Gary and Min Ho, you may exchange your bags with another team.

1766
01:06:47,476 --> 01:06:50,476
(Which team will Gary and Min Ho choose?)

1767
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:53,806
- How about Haha's team? - Haha's team?

1768
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:55,646
We don't have any gold.

1769
01:06:55,646 --> 01:06:56,976
- You don't? - He's lying.

1770
01:06:57,276 --> 01:06:59,646
I normally get upset easily. I'm sorry.

1771
01:06:59,976 --> 01:07:02,346
- We'll exchange with this bag. - Okay.

1772
01:07:02,346 --> 01:07:03,406
(They choose Jae Seok's bag.)

1773
01:07:03,476 --> 01:07:04,806
Jae Seok's bag?

1774
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:05,806
(I hope it's not the one with gold.)

1775
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,346
- They look nervous. - Did you keep our bag safely?

1776
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:09,346
Yes.

1777
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:11,846
Is this our bag?

1778
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:15,806
(They open the bag.)

1779
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:19,206
(Here's the gold.)

1780
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,976
- Gosh. - They got gold.

1781
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:24,176
(Did his fake acting succeed?)

1782
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:26,346
I bet they got gold.

1783
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,976
I think they did.

1784
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:31,006
Min Ho's reaction is too awkward.

1785
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,676
(Jong Kook is quick.)

1786
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:34,806
(What's in Ji Hye and Jae Seok's bag?)

1787
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:36,146
- Is this our new bag? - Yes.

1788
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:38,476
She seems upset.

1789
01:07:38,476 --> 01:07:42,246
Ji Hye looks very upset. I can see it on her face.

1790
01:07:42,246 --> 01:07:43,276
(Did Ji Hye get the right bag?)

1791
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:44,506
- She looks very upset. - I'm not upset.

1792
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:47,006
- Do you have a bomb in both bags? - That would be funny.

1793
01:07:47,006 --> 01:07:48,006
Then she has two bombs.

1794
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:49,906
(This morning,)

1795
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:53,846
(Gary and Min Ho chose their bag carefully.)

1796
01:07:54,746 --> 01:07:57,376
We have to exchange the bags carefully.

1797
01:07:58,146 --> 01:07:59,246
Shall I open mine first?

1798
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:00,506
(Inside their bag,)

1799
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:02,206
(they find a bomb.)

1800
01:08:02,206 --> 01:08:04,306
We have a bomb.

1801
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:07,606
(When Jae Seok and Jong Kook exchanged bags...)

1802
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:09,006
I'll exchange with this.

1803
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:10,506
(Min Ho and Gary waited for their chance.)

1804
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:14,446
(Gary and Min Ho exchanged their bomb with gold.)

1805
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:19,446
(Their plan becomes successful.)

1806
01:08:20,476 --> 01:08:21,876
Why did they exchange with ours?

1807
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:25,706
She shouldn't have said anything. She made a big mistake.

1808
01:08:25,706 --> 01:08:27,446
I think we got something good.

1809
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:30,546
At the end, something seemed strange.

1810
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:34,106
- Ji Hye got angry. - She got angry.

1811
01:08:34,316 --> 01:08:38,176
Also, Jae Seok's eyes quivered so much.

1812
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:42,176
- I think... - We have a good chance of winning.

1813
01:08:43,816 --> 01:08:44,816
(Gary and Min Ho get the gold.)

1814
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:46,346
(The other two teams have bombs.)

1815
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:50,246
The final race is "Pass the Bomb".

1816
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:53,316
When the four teams without the bomb...

1817
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:56,446
find two bags of gold that are hidden,

1818
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:59,776
they get to escape and are exempt from being penalised.

1819
01:08:59,816 --> 01:09:04,746
One of the teams has a bag of gold already.

1820
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:07,406
That team has to find one more bag.

1821
01:09:07,406 --> 01:09:08,706
(That team is Gary and Min Ho.)

1822
01:09:08,706 --> 01:09:11,646
The teams with a bomb...

1823
01:09:12,276 --> 01:09:15,906
can give the bomb to someone else by taking off his name tag.

1824
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:20,106
Only the masters can take off the name tags.

1825
01:09:20,106 --> 01:09:21,816
(There are only seven bags of gold.)

1826
01:09:23,816 --> 01:09:26,346
(Find 2 bags of gold to escape.)

1827
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,106
Only the team with bombs can rip name tags.

1828
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:30,106
(They pretend not to have a bomb.)

1829
01:09:30,106 --> 01:09:32,106
Let's pretend like we're looking for the bags.

1830
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:35,076
- Do you mean the bags of gold? - Yes.

1831
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:38,046
Other teams don't know that we have a bomb.

1832
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:40,376
It's Jae Seok's team.

1833
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,776
Who is it?

1834
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:43,606
- It's Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok.

1835
01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:45,146
He doesn't have anything.

1836
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:48,046
- We can catch Ji Hyo. - Let's go downstairs.

1837
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,876
They might think we have a bomb.

1838
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:52,406
They might.

1839
01:09:52,406 --> 01:09:54,976
- We can pretend to attack. - Okay.

1840
01:09:54,976 --> 01:09:56,376
(They pretend as if they have a bomb.)

1841
01:09:56,376 --> 01:09:57,376
(She hesitates.)

1842
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:01,106
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook appear.)

1843
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:03,206
(They must run to survive.)

1844
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:06,316
(He runs after Ji Hyo, the master.)

1845
01:10:06,316 --> 01:10:07,676
Run away, Ji Hyo!

1846
01:10:07,876 --> 01:10:09,946
Run away, Ji Hyo!

1847
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,316
I caught her. Hurry, Do Yeon.

1848
01:10:13,406 --> 01:10:15,746
(I'll protect my master.)

1849
01:10:15,746 --> 01:10:17,006
(Only Do Yeon can take off the name tag.)

1850
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:19,406
- Do Yeon, you must come here. - Run away, Ji Hyo!

1851
01:10:19,846 --> 01:10:21,816
- It's already over. - Hurry up, Do Yeon.

1852
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:22,816
Kick him there!

1853
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:25,176
- Where? - Kick him there!

1854
01:10:27,006 --> 01:10:28,246
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1855
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:32,176
(Ji Hyo is at the risk of getting a bomb.)

1856
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:33,776
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. - I'm sorry.

1857
01:10:35,076 --> 01:10:36,376
(Ji Hyo's name tag is ripped.)

1858
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:39,076
I'm sorry. You'd do the same in our shoes.

1859
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:40,606
- We're in a hurry. - Catch someone else.

1860
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:42,276
(This is unfair.)

1861
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:45,316
I don't want the bomb any more.

1862
01:10:45,316 --> 01:10:46,546
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook get rid of their bomb.)

1863
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,246
- He's such a gentleman. - Come to your senses.

1864
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,106
(They can look for bags of gold.)

1865
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:52,646
- Why? - We need to focus on the gold now.

1866
01:10:52,646 --> 01:10:54,106
We have a bomb now.

1867
01:10:54,106 --> 01:10:56,046
I can't believe that they got us.

1868
01:10:56,046 --> 01:10:59,276
If you hide it like this, nobody will know you have a bomb.

1869
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:00,876
(They became a new bomb.)

1870
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:04,146
It could be somewhere here.

1871
01:11:04,146 --> 01:11:05,776
(They came down to the underground level.)

1872
01:11:05,776 --> 01:11:07,546
(We really want to find gold.)

1873
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:09,146
Let's go this way.

1874
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:10,246
(He looks around.)

1875
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:11,316
What is it?

1876
01:11:12,546 --> 01:11:13,576
(What is it? Are you a bomb?)

1877
01:11:13,576 --> 01:11:16,676
- What is it? Are you a bomb? - I was startled.

1878
01:11:16,676 --> 01:11:18,376
- I'm not a bomb. - Be honest.

1879
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:21,176
- I'm not. We're looking for it. - I was frightened.

1880
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:24,946
- You guys are not, are you? - No, we're not.

1881
01:11:25,316 --> 01:11:27,546
- I was startled. - There is somebody.

1882
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:29,316
Who? Who's coming now?

1883
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:32,476
- Someone is coming. Go back. - What?

1884
01:11:32,476 --> 01:11:34,316
(Who else? It's me.)

1885
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:37,546
(She's as fast as lightening with aggressive hands.)

1886
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:38,576
(Jae Seok is fully supporting her.)

1887
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:40,676
Haha, Haha.

1888
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:41,776
(She tears it off.)

1889
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:44,006
You guys are so fast.

1890
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:45,246
I'm sorry.

1891
01:11:45,246 --> 01:11:47,776
It's that woman again who touched my bottom.

1892
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,476
Goodness.

1893
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:51,406
Let's hide this under here.

1894
01:11:51,446 --> 01:11:53,346
You have to pretend not to be a bomb.

1895
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:54,346
(The bomb goes to Joon Hyun and Haha.)

1896
01:11:54,346 --> 01:11:57,646
We need to find the gold quickly.

1897
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,816
(They can look for the gold now.)

1898
01:11:58,946 --> 01:12:00,376
Let's get out of here quickly.

1899
01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:03,376
Now, I feel like I'm really on Running Man.

1900
01:12:03,376 --> 01:12:05,146
- Now you feel it. - I feel my heart pounding.

1901
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:06,976
- You do? - I feel like I'm in Running Man.

1902
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:08,976
- It looks like real Running Man. - Yes.

1903
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:11,816
(Peeking)

1904
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:14,206
Okay. Look over there. Isn't there any?

1905
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:16,816
I can hear some sound.

1906
01:12:17,406 --> 01:12:20,846
(What's happening upstairs?)

1907
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:22,446
Sorry. I was not thinking enough.

1908
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:25,246
I was not. I won't do it again.

1909
01:12:25,246 --> 01:12:26,476
What is it?

1910
01:12:27,106 --> 01:12:29,176
- I was not thinking enough. - Hey.

1911
01:12:29,176 --> 01:12:31,206
- They have bombs. - Just...

1912
01:12:31,376 --> 01:12:34,316
help get others quickly.

1913
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:35,746
Wait, is it Ji Hyo?

1914
01:12:35,746 --> 01:12:36,976
(They run automatically.)

1915
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:38,006
(The bomb is after you.)

1916
01:12:38,006 --> 01:12:39,076
Are you coming?

1917
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:40,946
I'm okay. Keep running.

1918
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:42,246
It's a bomb.

1919
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:43,706
Run away.

1920
01:12:45,006 --> 01:12:46,106
Hey.

1921
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,406
- Jong Kook, I'm on my way. - Do Yeon, keep away from them.

1922
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,976
I'm following you.

1923
01:12:49,976 --> 01:12:52,316
(The owner has a hard time running.)

1924
01:12:54,406 --> 01:12:55,506
Where did he go?

1925
01:12:56,976 --> 01:12:58,176
Where is he?

1926
01:13:01,046 --> 01:13:03,816
Where is Se Chan? I lost him.

1927
01:13:04,976 --> 01:13:06,406
Se Chan.

1928
01:13:07,076 --> 01:13:08,376
Where are you?

1929
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:11,006
Have you seen Se Chan?

1930
01:13:11,946 --> 01:13:13,316
(They lost each other while running away.)

1931
01:13:13,676 --> 01:13:15,446
Where did he go?

1932
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:18,346
- Can I warm up a bit? - Sure.

1933
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:20,316
- I'm really fast. - You are fast.

1934
01:13:20,446 --> 01:13:23,076
- I run so fast. - He keeps saying he's fast.

1935
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:24,906
You will make me anxious.

1936
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:26,776
You're fast, aren't you?

1937
01:13:27,476 --> 01:13:29,676
(Is this what you meant?)

1938
01:13:29,676 --> 01:13:32,606
Where did he go? He is really fast.

1939
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:36,076
Are you Se Chan's cameraman? Where is he?

1940
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:37,946
You didn't find him?

1941
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:42,406
I'm going crazy. Is he off-camera, then?

1942
01:13:44,506 --> 01:13:46,746
(He's right.)

1943
01:13:48,506 --> 01:13:51,406
(He's shooting Running Man alone.)

1944
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:54,906
(It's hard to find him.)

1945
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:56,446
Now, I'm relieved.

1946
01:13:58,746 --> 01:14:01,646
- We need to find the gold. - Where can we find it?

1947
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,106
- Gosh. - I'm startled.

1948
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,676
- What are you doing? - Excuse me?

1949
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:07,676
The bomb is coming down.

1950
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:08,876
Did you say bomb?

1951
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:10,876
Kwang Soo. He's coming.

1952
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,246
He's coming again.

1953
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:13,406
(They noticed the pink bomb instinctively.)

1954
01:14:13,406 --> 01:14:14,676
Why are you following me?

1955
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:17,176
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo should pass the bomb to find the gold.)

1956
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:19,146
Run away, Min Ho.

1957
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,746
Run away.

1958
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:25,576
(Gary tries to block Kwang Soo.)

1959
01:14:25,576 --> 01:14:26,646
I failed.

1960
01:14:27,646 --> 01:14:28,846
Come over here.

1961
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:31,146
- Come here. - Get Ji Hyo.

1962
01:14:31,146 --> 01:14:32,376
Please block Ji Hyo.

1963
01:14:32,376 --> 01:14:33,706
Ji Hyo.

1964
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:37,176
Tear it off. You can just tear it off, Ji Hyo.

1965
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:39,646
(He desperately defends himself.)

1966
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,246
Why are you doing this to us?

1967
01:14:41,246 --> 01:14:42,946
- Tear it off. - No.

1968
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:44,376
I'll tickle him.

1969
01:14:44,976 --> 01:14:46,006
(She tears his name tag off.)

1970
01:14:46,006 --> 01:14:48,746
Kwang Soo, why do you tickle me?

1971
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:50,946
Goodness.

1972
01:14:51,576 --> 01:14:52,976
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1973
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:55,816
- But we take turns to get bombs. - You're right.

1974
01:14:57,846 --> 01:15:00,476
Se Chan. Se Chan.

1975
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:02,206
Se Chan.

1976
01:15:02,546 --> 01:15:04,706
Se Chan.

1977
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:07,676
Hey. Come up.

1978
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:09,046
There he is.

1979
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,106
I found him.

1980
01:15:12,506 --> 01:15:14,846
You're safe. Did you lose your name tag?

1981
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:16,546
No, I didn't.

1982
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:17,946
I kept running away.

1983
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,676
- Well done. - I kept looking for you.

1984
01:15:19,676 --> 01:15:21,906
I was looking for you, too. They're running.

1985
01:15:21,906 --> 01:15:24,076
They're coming up. Come here.

1986
01:15:24,076 --> 01:15:25,246
Come here, Seok Jin.

1987
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:27,546
(We'll crush you.)

1988
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,776
- Seok Jin, do you have gold? - No, I don't.

1989
01:15:30,076 --> 01:15:31,906
- Go find one. - At this time...

1990
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:34,676
- Really. - Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

1991
01:15:34,676 --> 01:15:36,176
See? I knew it.

1992
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:37,706
Hey, Hey.

1993
01:15:38,176 --> 01:15:40,406
Catch him.

1994
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:44,476
Catch him.

1995
01:15:44,846 --> 01:15:46,546
I told you to catch him.

1996
01:15:46,546 --> 01:15:48,106
(The giraffe and the rhino attacks him.)

1997
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:49,106
Did you get him?

1998
01:15:49,906 --> 01:15:52,746
I got him for you.

1999
01:15:53,146 --> 01:15:55,176
You should remember this.

2000
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,706
You have to.

2001
01:15:56,706 --> 01:15:58,646
- Please remember this. - You, fool. You should help me.

2002
01:15:58,646 --> 01:16:01,676
Fool? I didn't like you from the start.

2003
01:16:01,746 --> 01:16:03,106
How dare you call him a fool.

2004
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:05,046
- I caught him. - You have to help me.

2005
01:16:05,046 --> 01:16:06,546
Let's help each other.

2006
01:16:06,776 --> 01:16:08,076
Excuse us.

2007
01:16:08,776 --> 01:16:10,946
(At the moment they wanted to rest)

2008
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,506
(They look scary.)

2009
01:16:14,506 --> 01:16:17,176
- Gosh, I'm startled. - Wait.

2010
01:16:17,176 --> 01:16:18,706
- What is it? - Oh, I see.

2011
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,776
How can you do this to us as soon as you see us?

2012
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,376
We were hiding to do this.

2013
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:23,776
What is that?

2014
01:16:24,776 --> 01:16:26,076
Min Ho, come quickly.

2015
01:16:26,846 --> 01:16:28,246
Min Ho, come quickly.

2016
01:16:28,246 --> 01:16:29,376
Gosh.

2017
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,706
(They get bombs again.)

2018
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:32,246
- We got the bombs right away. - We can't help it.

2019
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,106
(They get bombs again.)

2020
01:16:34,106 --> 01:16:35,546
(Se Chan, Seok Jin, Joon Hyun and Haha have bombs.)

2021
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:37,676
Min Ho, Min Ho.

2022
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,206
(Right after they tossed the bombs, they find a bag.)

2023
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:42,606
Did you find it?

2024
01:16:42,976 --> 01:16:44,506
- I found it. - You did?

2025
01:16:44,506 --> 01:16:47,476
I can't open it.

2026
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:52,846
(It's really gold.)

2027
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:54,976
Aren't we too fast?

2028
01:16:55,106 --> 01:16:57,346
Really? Is it over already?

2029
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:58,746
Oh my gosh.

2030
01:16:58,746 --> 01:17:00,346
We found them too easily.

2031
01:17:01,946 --> 01:17:04,106
Shall we go over now?

2032
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:07,316
- Should we go downstairs? - Let's go. We already have gold.

2033
01:17:08,176 --> 01:17:10,076
Is there anything? What is it?

2034
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,006
Goodness. If this is gold, why don't you go out with me?

2035
01:17:13,746 --> 01:17:15,646
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2036
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,576
(They don't know what to do.)

2037
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:20,676
- This is incredible. - It is.

2038
01:17:20,676 --> 01:17:22,246
Do you want to go out with me?

2039
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:23,816
But my opinion is important, too.

2040
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:25,376
Then you should've told me your opinion.

2041
01:17:25,376 --> 01:17:26,976
- Why should I? - You should have told me.

2042
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,846
- I thought it was not gold. - I told you. Check with the camera.

2043
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:30,976
(We started to date from today.)

2044
01:17:30,976 --> 01:17:32,316
Is this our first day, then?

2045
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:34,476
Sure. Although we can break up any time.

2046
01:17:34,476 --> 01:17:36,576
- Let's break up tonight, then. - This is really gold.

2047
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:39,906
- You're so cool. - I don't know what's going on.

2048
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,906
- He's incredible. - I looked just in case.

2049
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:43,676
You look awesome.

2050
01:17:44,676 --> 01:17:46,006
He looks awesome.

2051
01:17:46,006 --> 01:17:49,206
He's so cool that I want to marry him.

2052
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,476
(They succeed in escaping.)

2053
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:52,276
They might be here.

2054
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:53,846
Let's look around here.

2055
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:58,206
(They're looking for gold.)

2056
01:17:58,776 --> 01:18:00,576
You need to look carefully.

2057
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:04,246
(She searches where others didn't look.)

2058
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:08,606
Kwang Soo.

2059
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:09,706
Why?

2060
01:18:11,346 --> 01:18:12,476
Did you find it?

2061
01:18:13,006 --> 01:18:15,946
(She finds gold as soon as she opens it.)

2062
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:17,206
(They need one more to escape.)

2063
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:18,276
We are getting close.

2064
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:23,446
What are you looking at? Is it a bag?

2065
01:18:23,976 --> 01:18:25,006
How did you see this?

2066
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:26,846
How did you see?

2067
01:18:27,506 --> 01:18:29,106
She is unbelievable.

2068
01:18:30,446 --> 01:18:32,406
(She finds gold consecutively.)

2069
01:18:32,406 --> 01:18:33,476
I found it.

2070
01:18:33,476 --> 01:18:37,906
(She surely has lucky hands.)

2071
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:40,576
Goodness.

2072
01:18:40,606 --> 01:18:44,106
It was so dramatic today, but we made it.

2073
01:18:44,106 --> 01:18:46,776
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo escape, too.)

2074
01:18:46,776 --> 01:18:47,846
We can escape, right?

2075
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:50,346
(The status of "Pass the Bomb")

2076
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:54,316
(Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo's teams escape.)

2077
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:57,606
(There are three teams left.)

2078
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:00,276
It's a disaster if they both attack us at the same time.

2079
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,546
Let's find Jae Seok.

2080
01:19:02,676 --> 01:19:04,846
We have to find someone first and pass the bombs.

2081
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:07,246
We have to...

2082
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:09,246
- focus on finding gold. - We have to.

2083
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:11,346
Let's pass the bomb to Jae Seok...

2084
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:13,406
and find gold.

2085
01:19:13,406 --> 01:19:15,346
Cheer up.

2086
01:19:15,406 --> 01:19:16,476
I'm exhausted, too.

2087
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:18,106
I'm getting upset. Quickly.

2088
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:20,506
We need to be swift.

2089
01:19:21,446 --> 01:19:24,746
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok try hard to find gold.)

2090
01:19:24,746 --> 01:19:26,106
Where can it be?

2091
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:27,876
Why?

2092
01:19:27,876 --> 01:19:29,606
(Se Chan Attacks her.)

2093
01:19:30,176 --> 01:19:31,876
(Se Chan hunts her while she was alone.)

2094
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:32,946
I can't hold on.

2095
01:19:34,046 --> 01:19:36,046
Let me tear it.

2096
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:38,676
- Se Chan. - I eliminated it.

2097
01:19:38,776 --> 01:19:40,046
(The bombs go back to Ji Hye and Jae Seok.)

2098
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:42,246
- I took it off. - What happened?

2099
01:19:42,246 --> 01:19:43,846
- I took it off. - Did you?

2100
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:45,006
Good job.

2101
01:19:46,246 --> 01:19:48,006
Let's go to find gold.

2102
01:19:48,006 --> 01:19:49,176
This way.

2103
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,376
Whether it's us or them,

2104
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,506
someone has to find the gold.

2105
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:58,206
This way. Come this way.

2106
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:00,346
What is it?

2107
01:20:01,076 --> 01:20:03,406
(Welcome to the trap.)

2108
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:07,576
(Joon Hyun tears the name tag.)

2109
01:20:08,816 --> 01:20:11,346
(The bombs move to Se Chan and Seok Jin.)

2110
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:15,006
I took his name tag. Pass the bombs to them.

2111
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,576
Let's finish it right away.

2112
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:18,346
Wait a moment.

2113
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:21,376
They must be waiting for us here.

2114
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:23,376
- We kept waiting for you. - You kept waiting?

2115
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:25,046
- Was the gold there? - I'm completely exhausted.

2116
01:20:25,506 --> 01:20:28,846
- Sorry, Seok Jin. - Sorry.

2117
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:33,106
There it is.

2118
01:20:33,106 --> 01:20:34,146
(Before they started to hunt to pass bombs,)

2119
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:37,816
(they already found gold in the beginning of the race.)

2120
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:39,316
It's gold.

2121
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:40,776
(They already found gold in the beginning of the race.)

2122
01:20:41,246 --> 01:20:45,476
If we find gold first and keep waiting, they'll appear there.

2123
01:20:45,706 --> 01:20:46,906
Let's go upstairs.

2124
01:20:46,906 --> 01:20:48,776
(They found gold first and hid it.)

2125
01:20:48,776 --> 01:20:51,176
There it is. I found it.

2126
01:20:51,176 --> 01:20:52,376
(So they can escape as soon as they pass the bomb.)

2127
01:20:52,376 --> 01:20:54,646
Let's hide.

2128
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:55,946
Let's hide.

2129
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:58,346
Chase them, then let them go.

2130
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:01,276
Open it.

2131
01:21:01,276 --> 01:21:03,476
- I'm sorry, Seok Jin. - Sorry.

2132
01:21:03,476 --> 01:21:04,876
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

2133
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:07,346
You look like a bear, but you're pretty sharp.

2134
01:21:07,346 --> 01:21:08,506
We found it.

2135
01:21:08,816 --> 01:21:09,846
(Joon Hyun and Haha escape last.)

2136
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:12,406
- We ran out of energy. - I'm about to cry.

2137
01:21:14,006 --> 01:21:15,506
Today's final race.

2138
01:21:15,506 --> 01:21:19,676
There is a death match for the owner of the bomb bag.

2139
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:23,376
The owner in each team will sit at the death match table.

2140
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:25,576
Why is Se Chan always so unlucky?

2141
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:28,776
I don't know. Why does it always happen to me?

2142
01:21:28,846 --> 01:21:32,546
Seok Jin and Jae Seok. Sit under the balloons.

2143
01:21:32,606 --> 01:21:35,816
- Should we take off our hats? - What should we do? Take it off?

2144
01:21:35,816 --> 01:21:39,076
On the table, there is one bomb bag...

2145
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:41,206
and one regular bag.

2146
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:43,606
You must try and switch...

2147
01:21:43,606 --> 01:21:47,946
your opponent's regular bag with your bomb bag.

2148
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:52,146
- The goal is to give away bombs. - This makes me nervous.

2149
01:21:52,146 --> 01:21:53,646
This is going to be a mind game.

2150
01:21:53,906 --> 01:21:56,976
- Master, please... - What do we do?

2151
01:21:56,976 --> 01:22:00,106
Why am I treated like this until the end?

2152
01:22:00,106 --> 01:22:02,206
- Master. - This isn't on, right?

2153
01:22:02,206 --> 01:22:03,876
It makes me nervous to just watch.

2154
01:22:03,906 --> 01:22:07,146
(The one to make the first move will win.)

2155
01:22:07,146 --> 01:22:08,676
Press the button.

2156
01:22:09,646 --> 01:22:10,976
One, two...

2157
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:12,476
(Who will go first?)

2158
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:13,546
Three.

2159
01:22:15,076 --> 01:22:16,776
(Stinging)

2160
01:22:17,576 --> 01:22:19,046
- Who is it? - Endure it.

2161
01:22:19,046 --> 01:22:21,606
(I can do anything to win.)

2162
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:23,076
She's hiding it.

2163
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:25,006
How did you do that?

2164
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,446
She lifted her thumb.

2165
01:22:27,446 --> 01:22:30,406
- How are you so spiteful? - It's okay, she endured it.

2166
01:22:30,406 --> 01:22:33,006
- She's tearing up. - It's okay, she acted well.

2167
01:22:33,446 --> 01:22:34,946
You're the best.

2168
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:37,346
- It's so funny. - I've never seen anyone like that.

2169
01:22:37,446 --> 01:22:39,506
- Come on the show again. - You're the best.

2170
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:41,246
- You must come again. - Seriously.

2171
01:22:41,246 --> 01:22:43,546
She endured it by biting her tongue.

2172
01:22:43,776 --> 01:22:45,576
She endured the electricity.

2173
01:22:45,706 --> 01:22:47,076
Okay, here we go.

2174
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:50,176
- Press it when it changes. - You have to press right away.

2175
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:54,276
(Who will be faster?)

2176
01:22:54,276 --> 01:22:55,506
(Screaming)

2177
01:22:55,506 --> 01:22:57,776
(Yang Se Chan loses.)

2178
01:22:57,776 --> 01:23:00,076
(That's what I'm talking about.)

2179
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,476
You can't endure it.

2180
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:03,506
It hurts.

2181
01:23:03,506 --> 01:23:05,976
- That's amazing. - She's hard-core.

2182
01:23:05,976 --> 01:23:07,706
- She's hard-core. - She was faster.

2183
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,006
She's scary.

2184
01:23:10,006 --> 01:23:12,346
- She's a scary woman. - I didn't know that was possible.

2185
01:23:12,506 --> 01:23:14,146
Death match will start now.

2186
01:23:14,276 --> 01:23:15,976
Your chances are 50 percent.

2187
01:23:15,976 --> 01:23:17,206
(Death match starts now.)

2188
01:23:17,206 --> 01:23:18,776
Please check your bags.

2189
01:23:18,906 --> 01:23:20,406
- We chose those. - Yes.

2190
01:23:20,406 --> 01:23:22,406
(The teams are checking the bags.)

2191
01:23:22,406 --> 01:23:23,876
- Se Chan looks cool. - Wow, Se Chan.

2192
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:25,476
- He has a poker face. - He looks cool.

2193
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:27,706
- You can't tell. - You can't read him.

2194
01:23:27,846 --> 01:23:29,446
He looks like he's in a movie.

2195
01:23:29,646 --> 01:23:31,546
Se Chan, look at me.

2196
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,606
Master, just for once.

2197
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:35,006
I don't think that helps.

2198
01:23:35,006 --> 01:23:36,876
Look at Ji Hye's eyes.

2199
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:39,846
Ji Hye is scary.

2200
01:23:39,846 --> 01:23:41,046
She'll glare through the bags.

2201
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:42,976
Her eyes are so fierce.

2202
01:23:43,146 --> 01:23:44,316
Is it the bag on the right?

2203
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:46,676
- Right from my side? - Yes.

2204
01:23:46,676 --> 01:23:48,346
- Is this one the bomb? - Yes.

2205
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:52,346
(Could it be?)

2206
01:23:52,346 --> 01:23:53,606
- Good, good. - It's not in there.

2207
01:23:54,146 --> 01:23:55,316
Good?

2208
01:23:56,006 --> 01:23:57,106
Hurry up and change it.

2209
01:23:57,106 --> 01:23:59,006
I'll give you another chance.

2210
01:23:59,006 --> 01:24:00,206
Why are you giving her a chance?

2211
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:03,706
I feel like I was too harsh on her before.

2212
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,946
- Just give it to me. - I want to give you a chance.

2213
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:08,776
- I'll give you a chance. - Just give me the bag.

2214
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:10,376
Hold on.

2215
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:13,106
- This makes it certain. - What is he saying?

2216
01:24:13,106 --> 01:24:14,876
I think you're the one that needs a chance.

2217
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:16,706
- I'm giving Ji Hye a chance. - He's persistent.

2218
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:18,206
- It's this bag for sure. - I'm sacrificing...

2219
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:21,206
Se Chan. You're making me look pathetic.

2220
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:24,606
I'll give you another chance.

2221
01:24:25,576 --> 01:24:27,446
- This one. - All right.

2222
01:24:27,446 --> 01:24:30,346
This will be amazing if there is a twist.

2223
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:33,706
- There is another chance? - Yes.

2224
01:24:33,776 --> 01:24:35,546
Se Chan is good at things like this.

2225
01:24:36,106 --> 01:24:37,506
- Bomb. - Right?

2226
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:39,606
Ji Hye, please open the bag to check.

2227
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:40,976
- Please. - Se Chan.

2228
01:24:40,976 --> 01:24:43,246
- Se Chan. - Does it end here?

2229
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:44,446
Open it slowly.

2230
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,476
- Se Chan, right? - Please.

2231
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:48,176
(The bag is being opened.)

2232
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:52,006
(This is the final match to determine the losers.)

2233
01:24:52,006 --> 01:24:57,146
(What was in Se Chan's bag?)

2234
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:58,146
(Pass)

2235
01:24:58,146 --> 01:24:59,476
Ji Hye passes.

2236
01:25:00,146 --> 01:25:02,046
(The balloon explodes.)

2237
01:25:02,046 --> 01:25:04,316
(Congratulations, Seok Jin.)

2238
01:25:07,506 --> 01:25:08,876
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok avoid getting penalty.)

2239
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:10,046
I'm so happy.

2240
01:25:10,446 --> 01:25:11,546
I'm so happy.

2241
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:13,946
Gosh.

2242
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:15,206
(Their love is still strong.)

2243
01:25:15,206 --> 01:25:17,206
It was so amazing.

2244
01:25:17,206 --> 01:25:18,476
I'm so happy.

2245
01:25:18,476 --> 01:25:21,146
(It was a good move.)

2246
01:25:21,606 --> 01:25:22,816
I'm so happy.

2247
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,176
(You need to meet a good master.)

2248
01:25:24,176 --> 01:25:27,476
Let's give a round of applause for Jang Do Yeon,

2249
01:25:27,506 --> 01:25:31,176
Joon Hyun, Ji Hye, Se Chan...

2250
01:25:31,176 --> 01:25:32,706
and Min ho.

2251
01:25:32,706 --> 01:25:35,906
(Thank you for joining us on Running Man.)
