1
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:12,292
(2016, Shanghai)

2
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:20,125
(This is a beloved tourist spot famous for its old buildings.)

3
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,155
- This is amazing. - There's so much to see.

4
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,155
(The seven members have arrived at Nanjing Road.)

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,755
It's amazing.

6
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:30,225
- Look at that car. - They filmed a movie here.

7
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:31,655
Should we take a selfie here?

8
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,425
- Let's take a selfie. - Everyone, come closer together.

9
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:34,865
We need to take a photo of this.

10
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,395
- Let's take a selfie. - Get ready.

11
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,725
- Gary. - Let's take a photo.

12
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,455
One, two, three.

13
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:46,425
(January 2016, the seven members at Nanjing Road)

14
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,555
This is fun.

15
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,755
You're right.

16
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,255
(The seven are all together in Nanjing Road)

17
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:56,155
(90 years ago)

18
00:00:56,255 --> 00:01:02,255
(1926, Shanghai, China)

19
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:09,725
(1926, the case of Shanghai Secret Society Y)

20
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:17,595
(The society was suffering from a lack of funds.)

21
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:22,855
(K, the leader of the independence movement in Shanghai...)

22
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:32,625
(was raising funds by diverting money from Japanese banks.)

23
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:44,125
(The Japanese army orders the arrest of K all over China.)

24
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:56,595
Come quick.

25
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:03,055
(The huge amount of funds K diverted are divided into six briefcases.)

26
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:20,695
(K was on his way to the Independence Army Headquarters...)

27
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:24,525
(in Shanghai with one of the briefcases.)

28
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:30,225
(The Japanese army continued to chase him,)

29
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,325
(and he was on the verge of getting caught.)

30
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:49,955
(K barely managed to get through the Japanese policemen.)

31
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:04,825
(Delivering the military funds safely could turn things around.)

32
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,225
(No matter what happens,)

33
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,155
(and whatever gets in his way,)

34
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:23,155
(he had to make it back to the Shanghai Headquarters.)

35
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:49,195
(Is this where his fight ends?)

36
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,825
(He's not afraid of getting arrested.)

37
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:56,825
(He's not afraid of getting harshly tortured either.)

38
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:59,025
(He just could not afford...)

39
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:04,295
(to lose this briefcase.)

40
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,795
(At that moment,)

41
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:17,725
(the fellow Independence Army soldiers appeared miraculously.)

42
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,725
(There is still hope!)

43
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:40,425
(K and the Independence Army overcame numerous crises.)

44
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:47,325
(They were not afraid to face anything to achieve independence.)

45
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:55,095
(However,)

46
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,095
(their mission was not...)

47
00:04:57,155 --> 00:05:00,995
(easy at all.)

48
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,525
(If only we could get through them...)

49
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,625
(If only we could get past this...)

50
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,725
(They risked their lives for the great cause.)

51
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:26,095
(Nothing could bend their will of achieving independence.)

52
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,625
(If only they could get through this,)

53
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:42,325
(they could be so close to gaining independence.)

54
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,125
(They thought...)

55
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:57,955
(they almost had it.)

56
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,795
(K got arrested, but...)

57
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:05,025
(the five briefcases with the military funds...)

58
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:10,155
(were still hidden somewhere in Shanghai.)

59
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:20,225
(10 members of the Secret Society appear in Shanghai.)

60
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:25,425
(Yu Jae Seok)

61
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:32,825
(Lee Kwang Soo)

62
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:40,725
(Jee Seok Jin)

63
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:46,695
(Kim Jong Kook)

64
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:52,725
(Haha)

65
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:59,725
(Gary)

66
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:05,595
(Song Ji Hyo)

67
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:13,895
(Jong Tae Se)

68
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,695
(Ji So Yun)

69
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:28,025
(Park Ji Sung)

70
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:40,425
(On one rainy winter day in Shanghai,)

71
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:51,425
(a letter...)

72
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:57,155
(was secretly delivered to each of the members.)

73
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,225
"Dear members of the Secret Society..."

74
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,525
"Dear members of the Secret Society..."

75
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:05,695
"Dear members of the Secret Society,"

76
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,325
"unfortunately, Mr K, who was delivering the military funds..."

77
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,695
"Unfortunately, Mr K, who was delivering the military funds..."

78
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,955
"got arrested by the Japanese policemen."

79
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,095
(Mr K got arrested by the Japanese policemen.)

80
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:22,425
"Collect all the funds Mr K hid in Shanghai..."

81
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:25,425
"and return to the Manchuria Headquarters."

82
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,325
"Agent J, the new director, must make it back."

83
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,225
"Agent J, the new director,"

84
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,595
"must make it back."

85
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:33,325
"More information on Agent J..."

86
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,095
"will be updated later."

87
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:36,425
"Come to..."

88
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,825
"the headquarters right now."

89
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:40,625
(Come to the headquarters right now.)

90
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:45,325
(Shanghai Headquarters of the Secret Society)

91
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,595
Fellows,

92
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:47,995
this is the headquarters.

93
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:51,155
(The headquarters look desolate.)

94
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,625
(There is one man waiting for 10 Secret Society members.

95
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:53,955
It looks so desolate.

96
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,525
Oh, hello!

97
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,625
- Welcome. Have a seat. - You are Captain.

98
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,995
It's been a while, Captain.

99
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,425
- It's been a while. - Have a seat.

100
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,295
- I will sit here. - I have a chair here.

101
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:07,225
Hello, I'm the director of Shanghai headquarters, Mr Go.

102
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:09,525
- You've travelled a long way. - Hello, Sir.

103
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,125
- It's nice to meet you. - Good job, everyone.

104
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:13,225
Good job, everybody.

105
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,625
It's not the time to clap your hands.

106
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:17,425
I'm sure you already heard about Mr K.

107
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:21,195
I will tell you briefly about how to obtain information...

108
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,325
- about the military funds. - Please tell us.

109
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:26,155
First, meet the informant in downtown...

110
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,195
and collect as many pieces of information as possible.

111
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,625
(Look for the informant with a red scarf.)

112
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,025
The secret code is "wo ai ni".

113
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:34,525
Then the informant will...

114
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,825
(The secret code is "wo ai ni".)

115
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,725
- do this. - That's my sign.

116
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,955
(In Shanghai, this sign been used for almost 100 years.)

117
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,325
It's my sign.

118
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:46,625
- It's mine. - Why is it yours?

119
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:47,725
It's mine.

120
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:49,925
- This has been around. - It's mine.

121
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,955
But when you receive a new piece of information, you must pay...

122
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,125
three cents in return.

123
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,325
- Three cents. - We have to pay too?

124
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:00,225
If you need a translation service,

125
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,025
look for the interpreter with a red umbrella.

126
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:06,325
Of course, you also need to pay him for the service.

127
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:08,225
- How much? - We have to pay them both?

128
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,325
- But we are on the same team. - Hold on.

129
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:11,625
We are trying to look for the military funds,

130
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,025
and we have to spend money?

131
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,325
We should save that money...

132
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:16,825
and use it for our operation.

133
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,195
This is all I can give you.

134
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,325
(It's going to be a long day, so drink up.)

135
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:24,025
You can complete different missions in downtown...

136
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:25,825
and earn your operation funds.

137
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,825
You must have already heard this.

138
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,325
No matter what happens, you must make sure...

139
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:33,695
Agent J makes it back to the Manchuria Headquarters.

140
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,895
- Who is Agent J? - Is it me, perhaps?

141
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:37,925
There are too many people whose name includes "J".

142
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,925
- It could be me. - Ji Sung has "J" too.

143
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,725
- Seok Jin has it too. - I have one too.

144
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,625
- Ji Hyo has it too. - I have it too.

145
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,725
- Jong Kook has it too. - Jong Kook has it.

146
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:46,925
- Agent J... - So Yun has it too.

147
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,895
- Right. - Who is Agent J?

148
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:49,955
It's not Kwang Soo.

149
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,625
- It's not me either. - It's not Gary.

150
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,995
- Us three are an exception. - It's not us three.

151
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,325
- Tae Se has "J" in his name too. - Right.

152
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,895
No matter what the sacrifices may be,

153
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,895
it is your duty to make sure Agent J returns to the headquarters.

154
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,955
- Don't forget that. - So...

155
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,195
what you mean is...

156
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,525
that some of us will be sacrificed.

157
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,595
That happens all the time anyway.

158
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,895
Now, set out to get the operation funds.

159
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,095
- Let's go. - Let's go.

160
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,325
- Let's go. - Let's go.

161
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,225
- Let's go. - Let's go, Seok Jin.

162
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,425
Who's Agent J? It could be any one of us.

163
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:23,025
(The 10 members finally leave.)

164
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,225
(1926, Shanghai)

165
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:34,425
(Find the lost military funds and Agent J.)

166
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:40,595
(10 Members of the Secret Society)

167
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,795
(Chapter 1: The Secret Society Rises)

168
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:49,525
(Shanghai was the centre of independence movement at the time.)

169
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,725
(There are trams and old cars.)

170
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:52,895
There are cars too.

171
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,425
(The street scenes of Shanghai in the 1920s are recreated.)

172
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:55,425
It's unbelievable.

173
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,195
It's moving!

174
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,225
(He's fascinated.)

175
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,225
Of course, it's moving.

176
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,425
(Why are you acting like it's your first time at Nanjing Road?)

177
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,055
I didn't know it would actually move.

178
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,625
It's like we travelled back in time.

179
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,795
(Nanjing Road was as busy as Korea's Myeongdong back then.)

180
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,325
- There's a tram. - Gary, this is where they shot...

181
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:11,925
- the movie "Lust, Caution". - "Lust, Caution"?

182
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:16,755
(Many movies were filmed in Nanjing Road.)

183
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,355
Do you know who I am?

184
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,755
(Glancing)

185
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,055
I'll only reveal it to you.

186
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,155
(I'll only reveal it to you.)

187
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:28,425
I am...

188
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,855
(I am...)

189
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:31,855
Ha Jung Woo.

190
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,155
(Laughing)

191
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,055
(You went too far.)

192
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,955
He's the Hawaii Pistol there,

193
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,125
and I'm the Broad-shouldered Gangster.

194
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,255
(I'm the Broad-shouldered Gangster.)

195
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:41,455
Do you get it?

196
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,755
I'm the Broad-shouldered Gangster.

197
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,855
I think they give us the hints in Chinese.

198
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,025
Yes. That's why we need the interpreters.

199
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,255
But then...

200
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,755
- we need some cash first. - Right.

201
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,855
- Let's look for it. - There's something there!

202
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,125
- Where? - Isn't that something over there?

203
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,955
The booth, right?

204
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,055
(They need to complete this mission to earn some money.)

205
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,255
We are here for the mission!

206
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,495
(We are here for the mission!)

207
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:03,725
Hello.

208
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,625
"Wasabi Dumpling"

209
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,955
"Take turns eating dumplings. The one who gets the wasabi loses".

210
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,955
(This is entirely on luck.)

211
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,455
- I'll go first! - Okay.

212
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,555
- You lose if you get the wasabi. - We can conquer it together.

213
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,755
- It's okay. Go! - Go!

214
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,155
- It's between you and me, right? - Yes.

215
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,595
(Swallowing)

216
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:23,755
Okay!

217
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,455
It's delicious.

218
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:26,855
Hold on.

219
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,855
(Gosh)

220
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:32,425
(He's got it.)

221
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,155
All right.

222
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:38,255
Did you get it?

223
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,855
(Sniffing)

224
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:43,155
(The wasabi is so strong.)

225
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:44,855
(Kwang Soo is always unlucky.)

226
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,155
It's impossible for Kwang Soo to win this type of games.

227
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,725
(Jong Kook earns three cents as his operation funds.)

228
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,955
Let me go again.

229
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:54,425
Please let me try again with her. Do you know this game?

230
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:56,855
The one that eats the wasabi dumpling loses.

231
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:58,955
Go!

232
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,395
- Should I go first? - Go ahead.

233
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:02,955
(He grabs one.)

234
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,455
(How could this be?)

235
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,655
Hold on.

236
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:08,855
No way.

237
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,495
Maybe they all have wasabi in it.

238
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:13,755
- You really got it again? - Are they all filled with wasabi?

239
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,325
- Is it strong? - For real?

240
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,125
- Again? - I get the money, then?

241
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,325
My goodness.

242
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:19,755
(Ji So Yun earned it easily.)

243
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:22,655
- How could you pick it again? - I've got my money.

244
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:23,725
(I'm crying because I'm sad, not because it's stings.)

245
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:26,595
This area is too large.

246
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,155
(Park Ji Sung is collecting information on his own.)

247
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,555
I think I saw something over there.

248
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,225
(I think I saw something there.)

249
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,855
Here it is!

250
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,055
I have to move fast.

251
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,655
I'm tired.

252
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:38,755
(I'm tired.)

253
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,725
I'm doing this for Agent J.

254
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:47,255
I feel like my heart is failing me.

255
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,595
(You won't be out of breath if you talk less.)

256
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,555
"Master of the Ball"

257
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:57,855
"To complete this mission, throw the ball in the air..."

258
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,395
"and catch it after doing three turns."

259
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,855
It's three turns, right?

260
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:03,725
One,

261
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:04,855
Two...

262
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:06,495
Goodness.

263
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,725
How high should I throw the ball?

264
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:16,155
(He's reluctant but gives it a go.)

265
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:17,655
(It dropped.)

266
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,655
(Turning)

267
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,055
Hold on. Give me a minute.

268
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,355
(I shouldn't get this dizzy.)

269
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,525
I'm dizzy.

270
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,055
Oh, boy.

271
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,455
This is more difficult that I thought.

272
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,495
(The ball flies away.)

273
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:36,455
Where is it?

274
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,755
Where did it go? I'm so dizzy.

275
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,025
(He's not good at handling the ball.)

276
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,755
I need to turn really fast.

277
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,325
(I'm the Captain!)

278
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:48,655
(He does a triple Axel.)

279
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,755
Now it's gone that way.

280
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,155
(Now it's gone that way.)

281
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,525
I failed.

282
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:55,595
(Captain Park is kind of cute.)

283
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,655
Get set. Go!

284
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,655
(Haha versus Tae Se)

285
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:00,055
(Struggling)

286
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:01,955
(Tae Se is unstoppable.)

287
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,855
(Tied to two ends of a rope, the one who rings their bell first wins.)

288
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,155
Tae Se, ring the bell.

289
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,725
- Ring the bell. - He's playing with Haha.

290
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:11,225
- I will ring it in a minute. - Hey!

291
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,595
Haha is unlucky to play this with Tae Se.

292
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,625
(Will Haha be able to take his first step?)

293
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:16,755
- Wow. - Hey.

294
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:18,225
(He has superhuman strength.)

295
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,555
(Ringing)

296
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,425
- Hey! - Oh, my.

297
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,655
That wasn't even a fair game.

298
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:26,555
(Why did it have to be him?)

299
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:27,755
Get set. Go!

300
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,955
(Next up, Jae Seok versus Seok Jin)

301
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,395
The floor is slippery.

302
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:32,655
- What do you mean? - The floor is slippery.

303
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,425
I'm going to win.

304
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,655
Wow.

305
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:37,525
- I've got it. - No, I'm slipping.

306
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:38,655
(Seok Jin's almost got it!)

307
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:40,855
(There)

308
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,595
(He misses.)

309
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,755
It didn't ring.

310
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:45,055
- No, it didn't ring. - This is my chance.

311
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,855
(He's being dragged.)

312
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:50,855
(Jae Seok wins.)

313
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,055
I'm so upset!

314
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,725
I thought we were friends.

315
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,595
I had no choice.

316
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,325
Thank you.

317
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,425
Thank you.

318
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:02,495
(Jae Seok and Tae Se each earn three cents.)

319
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,625
(Kissing)

320
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,155
- Today's the day, my friend. - It is.

321
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,425
We can accomplish many things today, my friend.

322
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,725
(Two of them look for the missions.)

323
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,855
"Guess what the ingredients are in this Chinese dish in three tries".

324
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,065
There are three of them.

325
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,755
They look like pork or beef.

326
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:19,155
Let me try this one. Isn't this duck?

327
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,495
- Never mind. - I know what it is.

328
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,595
Try it. Try the smallest one.

329
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,255
It looks like a pig's ear.

330
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:27,625
It is a pig's ear.

331
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,065
You think so?

332
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,755
It must be. Try it.

333
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:31,955
(Is this really a pig's ear?)

334
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,595
Right? We've tried it before.

335
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:35,655
That's right.

336
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,325
- I told you so. - Give them your answer.

337
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:38,425
I got this one.

338
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:39,595
It's a pig's ear.

339
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,065
- I got it! - It's right.

340
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,255
(He guesses the answer.)

341
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,425
- Seok Jin. - I gave away the answer.

342
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,155
Give me a coin.

343
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,155
- Give me one too. - But this is all I have.

344
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,525
(They should have done their own missions.)

345
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,855
I have to win a game.

346
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:51,955
You don't have a single penny?

347
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,255
No.

348
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,355
I lost all the missions.

349
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,855
(They need coins to gain important information.)

350
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,655
I need to earn money quickly.

351
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:00,595
- Someone's coming out. - There is someone.

352
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,495
(The three of them try another mission.)

353
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,255
(Introducing the pride of China, Face Mask Changing)

354
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,255
(Flipping)

355
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,395
(The mask changed suddenly.)

356
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:16,455
It's Face Mask Changing.

357
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:18,355
(This is an ancient Chinese dramatic art that involves...)

358
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:19,455
He's perfect at it.

359
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,755
(changing masks in an instant.)

360
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:25,855
(Flipping)

361
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:33,725
(Once, twice, thrice and four times in a row)

362
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,655
(Ta-da)

363
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,325
That was shocking.

364
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,155
- My goodness. - That startled me.

365
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:47,625
(Incredible)

366
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,755
That's how you look.

367
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,755
(He's rather cute looking.)

368
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,225
(He sticks his tongue out.)

369
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,525
(Slapping)

370
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,655
(Surprise)

371
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,125
He has the mask on again.

372
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,065
- How did he get it back on? - How?

373
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,225
- How did he do it again? - That's why he's the master.

374
00:19:05,355 --> 00:19:06,955
(Hopping)

375
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:09,855
(How did you enjoy my performance?)

376
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,355
I've never seen this before.

377
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,425
- You're incredible. - Where do you keep your masks?

378
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,565
(What could their mission be?)

379
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:17,855
Jae Seok joined later so he doesn't get a chance.

380
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,065
- Yes. - What?

381
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:21,125
(I'm excluded?)

382
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,155
It makes sense. You weren't here to hear the instructions.

383
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:24,655
Hello, Inspector Gadget.

384
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,455
Go, gadget arms.

385
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:28,065
I'm the Broad-shouldered Gangster.

386
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,255
He says he's a gangster.

387
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,355
I'm a real gangster.

388
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,855
I'll hit you with my shoulders.

389
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,625
(Be aware of Jae Seok's shoulders.)

390
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,065
I've only heard about such a gangster.

391
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,625
You're the Broad-shouldered Gangster.

392
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:38,955
Right. I'm the one.

393
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,325
- I have to be on my way? - Yes.

394
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:41,655
Gosh.

395
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:42,955
- Come back later. - Bye, Gangster.

396
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:44,125
(Bye, Gangster.)

397
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:45,855
- Bye. - Go, gadget arms!

398
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,225
See you later, Miss Seok Jin.

399
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,625
See you later.

400
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,755
"Miss"? Call me Madam.

401
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,155
- Sorry, Madam. I must get going. - I'm a Madam.

402
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,225
Here's your mission.

403
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,155
In what sequence...

404
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,225
did the two-faced mask appear?

405
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,455
- The sequence? - The two-faced one?

406
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,595
One, two, three.

407
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,755
(Ji Sung: second, Seok Jin: third, Haha: second)

408
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,065
You both picked second.

409
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,155
I picked a different one.

410
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:13,425
The correct answer is...

411
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:14,755
- second. - Yes!

412
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,755
(Correct answer is the second mask.)

413
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,065
I knew it.

414
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:22,155
How did you guys know?

415
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,255
(The mask appeared right after the first one.)

416
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,325
I counted how many times it changed.

417
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,855
I even counted how many times the fan was opened.

418
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:29,125
You counted 11 changes?

419
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:30,155
I thought it was nine times.

420
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,065
He held his fingers out.

421
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,065
- I counted 9. - It was 11.

422
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,655
There were 11 masks.

423
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,655
- But... - He's amazing.

424
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,255
I didn't think that would be the mission.

425
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,955
You just guessed, right?

426
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,125
- No, I knew that one for sure. - He's right.

427
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:47,655
It was white on one side and red or blue on the other.

428
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:48,755
(He's memorised the sequence and mask colours as well.)

429
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:49,855
That's incredible.

430
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,125
- Ji Sung, aren't you rich? - You must have won many games.

431
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,755
You must be rich.

432
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,255
(Ji Sung wins with his unbelievable memory.)

433
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,755
(It's time to look for an informant.)

434
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,855
I have to find someone who looks like an informant.

435
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,425
(The informant holds clues about Agent J and military funds.)

436
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:05,855
How would an informant look?

437
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:08,755
Oh my, I have no idea.

438
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:13,855
(Where would the informant be amongst the crowd?)

439
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,565
Oh.

440
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,655
Could it be that one?

441
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,855
(He spots a woman wearing a red scarf.)

442
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:22,955
They wouldn't just make us say...

443
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:26,065
"Wo ai ni" to nobody.

444
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,425
(Jong Kook searches thoroughly for an informant.)

445
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:32,855
(He spots the red scarf.)

446
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:38,065
Wo ai ni.

447
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,355
(He says the code word.)

448
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,225
The secret code is "Wo ai ni".

449
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,455
Then the informant will make a heart like this.

450
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:46,155
(The right person will show him a heart.)

451
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,065
Wo ai ni.

452
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,755
(He gives it a try.)

453
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:53,055
Wo ai ni.

454
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,755
Wo ai ni.

455
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:57,855
(He says the secret code.)

456
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,325
(A heart)

457
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:06,555
(Jong Kook finds an informant.)

458
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:12,995
(And so does Ji Sung.)

459
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:19,725
(He can buy information about Agent J and military funds from them.)

460
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:26,825
(They move to a place where no one can see them.)

461
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:33,195
(The cost of information is three cents.)

462
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:39,725
(Jong Kook acquires an important piece of information.)

463
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,825
(Ji Sung buys a piece of information for three cents.)

464
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:52,195
(What kind of information is inside the envelope?)

465
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:53,455
Goodness.

466
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:54,495
(What kind of information is inside the envelope?)

467
00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:59,955
(It's a piece of information about Agent J.)

468
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,395
(What does this mean?)

469
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,655
It's in Chinese.

470
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:10,295
(It's another piece of information about Agent J.)

471
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:11,495
It's a man.

472
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,695
(It's another piece of information about Agent J.)

473
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:13,825
I should...

474
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:17,495
(The Chinese characters indicate a man.)

475
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:18,695
I should keep this with me.

476
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:23,495
I'll have to hide it for now.

477
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,595
I'll eventually find out who it is.

478
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,855
(He hides the information inside his jacket.)

479
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,855
(He pays one cent for translation.)

480
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:31,955
- Here. - Okay.

481
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:33,595
What does this mean?

482
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,295
(It's the same information as Jong Kook's.)

483
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,555
It means "Small eyes".

484
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:38,695
(It means "Small eyes".)

485
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:40,595
- Small eyes? - Yes.

486
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,695
- What? - What are you doing here?

487
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,195
- Yes? - What?

488
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,655
- What's up? - I want to know...

489
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:48,095
- what you're doing. - What do you mean?

490
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,195
Well...

491
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,695
(Wait a minute.)

492
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,295
- Wait. - Come on.

493
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,395
(Wait a minute.)

494
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,455
(Ji Sung has small eyes.)

495
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:59,195
No matter what,

496
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:00,995
you have to bring Agent J...

497
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,695
back to the Manchuria Headquarters.

498
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:03,825
(Agent J must escape with the military funds.)

499
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:06,495
(So far, the only information...)

500
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:08,495
(they have is...)

501
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:12,695
(a man with small eyes.)

502
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,695
(Who is Agent J?)

503
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:19,755
(Meanwhile,)

504
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,695
(Ji Hyo is not very lucky today.)

505
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,395
Hey.

506
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:32,495
(She gets inside a classic car.)

507
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:37,025
Where would everyone else be?

508
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,495
I have no money.

509
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,855
(I have no money, but I have class.)

510
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:43,925
Sir.

511
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:46,295
(She gets a free ride.)

512
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:49,055
I'll get off here, please.

513
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,355
(I'll get off here, please.)

514
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:54,925
(Thank you for letting me ride for free.)

515
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,895
(I got here so easily.)

516
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:02,955
Ji Hyo.

517
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:04,695
Jae Seok.

518
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:06,695
Where were you?

519
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:10,825
I couldn't get any money. So I'm on my way to get some.

520
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,195
(Wait a minute.)

521
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,295
(Does Jae Seok have money?)

522
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,395
Do you want to play the jujube game?

523
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:18,455
What's that?

524
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:21,195
Whoever eats the jujube first wins.

525
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,455
- Let's do it. - All right.

526
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,755
I already have some funds. I'm doing this only for you.

527
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,925
Thank you.

528
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,925
(Thank you.)

529
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,095
I won't forget this.

530
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,195
All right.

531
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,195
Okay.

532
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:33,925
(Whoever eats the jujube first with chopsticks wins.)

533
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:34,995
Okay.

534
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,555
- Are you going to betray me later? - No.

535
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,695
I don't have any money right now.

536
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:41,925
All right.

537
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:43,695
(They have to eat this.)

538
00:25:43,795 --> 00:25:46,595
Will you be in trouble if I quit and just leave?

539
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:47,755
Of course.

540
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,795
- Because I have no money. - Get ready.

541
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:51,995
Start.

542
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:52,995
(Start)

543
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,725
(They fight with their chopsticks.)

544
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,755
Where did it go?

545
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:05,095
(It's my jujube!)

546
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,395
Didn't you say...

547
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,955
you were going to let me win?

548
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:12,055
I said I'd come with you. I didn't say...

549
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:13,795
I would let you win.

550
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:19,925
(Jae Seok gets it first.)

551
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,495
(He puts it in his mouth.)

552
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:23,895
(Jae Seok wins.)

553
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,895
I trusted him.

554
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,095
How lucky I am.

555
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,595
- Oh, gosh. - I didn't think I'd win.

556
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,955
Didn't you say you'd give me a chance?

557
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,995
- Jae Seok. - I'm sorry.

558
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:39,195
I said I'd come with you,

559
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,395
but I never said I wouldn't eat it.

560
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,825
Jae Seok!

561
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:44,995
I trusted you!

562
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,055
I'll see you next time.

563
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:48,195
Okay.

564
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:52,395
(Let's go get some information.)

565
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:56,395
(Although he has money...)

566
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:58,195
I saw them around before.

567
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,455
(It's difficult to find the informants.)

568
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,995
(He found one!)

569
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:08,395
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok fight to get the informant.)

570
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,295
(The informant chooses Jae Seok.)

571
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,395
That's not fair.

572
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,495
- Can she choose? - Yes.

573
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,495
Of course. She just did.

574
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,295
Thank you.

575
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:22,195
(Jae Seok buys the piece of information for three cents.)

576
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:26,395
(The information he received is...)

577
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,495
What does this mean?

578
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:31,825
(It's about Agent J.)

579
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:35,695
(He pays one cent for translation.)

580
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:39,295
Could you whisper it to me?

581
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,955
(Could you whisper it to me?)

582
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,555
(Agent J has small eyes.)

583
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,855
(There are multiple members with small eyes.)

584
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:50,825
- Do you know who it is? - No.

585
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,095
(They need more information.)

586
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:53,925
It's too difficult. The hint is too vague.

587
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:58,395
Is there only one Chinese hint?

588
00:27:58,555 --> 00:27:59,595
This is the hint.

589
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:03,025
(Tae Se passes this mission at once.)

590
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:04,695
Thank you.

591
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:05,795
(Tae Se passes this mission at once.)

592
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,895
Excuse me. Wo ai ni.

593
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:11,095
(He finds an informant and gets the information instantly.)

594
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,055
(He wins...)

595
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,295
(the dice rolling mission as well.)

596
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,395
Thank you.

597
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,495
(He got three hints.)

598
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:19,595
This is my third hint.

599
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:21,825
(Tae Se is getting close to finding out who Agent J is.)

600
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,595
(Gary, on the other hand...)

601
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,195
The answer is eight.

602
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:27,895
- You're wrong. - Okay.

603
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:29,795
Ox tongue?

604
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:32,795
(He fails every mission.)

605
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:37,195
(Gary is a total opposite of Tae Se.)

606
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:41,195
I wouldn't know even if I heard it again.

607
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,025
(He tries hard,)

608
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,895
(but he keeps failing.)

609
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,695
My goodness, this is frustrating.

610
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:47,795
(Gary's...)

611
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,195
(last hope is...)

612
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,295
So Yun!

613
00:28:50,955 --> 00:28:51,955
Ji So Yun!

614
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:53,895
Come here.

615
00:28:54,595 --> 00:28:56,055
- Did you get any information? - Hey.

616
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,095
No. Do you want to play a game with me?

617
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,395
Have you played the dumpling one?

618
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,455
- Yes. - Have you?

619
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:03,195
- Yes. - Do you want to try again?

620
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:04,395
It'll be too strong.

621
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:06,095
- Did you win? - Yes.

622
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:08,095
Really? Let's do it one more time.

623
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:09,395
You go first.

624
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:13,155
(Whoever eats the wasabi dumpling loses.)

625
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:15,195
- I think it'll be this one. - Put it in your mouth.

626
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,555
(Chewing)

627
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,195
Don't hold it back.

628
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,295
- Okay. - Was it okay?

629
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,295
(Gary passed.)

630
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:27,695
(She chews it.)

631
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,655
- Was it okay? - Yes.

632
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,495
(Gary passed.)

633
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:39,195
Oh gosh.

634
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,455
(One of them contains wasabi.)

635
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:44,755
Just shove it in your mouth.

636
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,755
(She chews it.)

637
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,595
(This is the one.)

638
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,195
(I win!)

639
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,155
It's really strong.

640
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:54,395
Can she get some water?

641
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,025
It's okay.

642
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,295
You can take the money.

643
00:29:58,395 --> 00:29:59,495
- Really? - Yes.

644
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:00,695
Thank you, So Yun.

645
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,495
This is my first money bag.

646
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:05,295
(Gary acquires money.)

647
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,395
It's strong.

648
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,595
It's really stings.

649
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,855
Wo ai ni.

650
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,855
(He finds an informant.)

651
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:19,095
(Gary buys the information for three cents.)

652
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:26,195
(It's a hint about Agent J.)

653
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:27,495
It's a man.

654
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,055
(He understood right away.)

655
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:30,395
It's a man.

656
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:32,095
Agent J is a man.

657
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,395
(Agent J is a man.)

658
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:36,095
(Information about Agent J is slowly being revealed.)

659
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:39,295
One, two, three.

660
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:40,995
Why are you doing this?

661
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,055
- I win! - No!

662
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,195
- Yes! - No!

663
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:45,595
(In order to find out who Agent J is...)

664
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:46,655
Yes.

665
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:51,195
(They need to get more hints.)

666
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,395
(The Secret Society has to find out who Agent J is.)

667
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:57,595
You can't lose this to anyone.

668
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:00,395
You must guess one of the ingredients.

669
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:05,295
(They must help Agent J escape with the military funds.)

670
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,955
(While they are busy finding hints,)

671
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,495
(Mr Go appears.)

672
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:12,655
Wait here.

673
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:15,195
I heard something's going on here.

674
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,695
What?

675
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:18,595
- Pardon? - Something will happen here.

676
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,595
- Shall I wait here? - Yes.

677
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:22,595
- Wait. - I need all the members.

678
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:26,025
(All members were called by the headquarters for emergency.)

679
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:27,295
What's going on?

680
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,595
- Broad-shouldered Gangster. - Fellows.

681
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,395
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are here too.)

682
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:33,925
You're Broad-shouldered Gangster?

683
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,095
- What? - Broad-shouldered Gangster.

684
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,095
Please wait here.

685
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,695
Aren't we a secret society?

686
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:41,095
We are out on the open street.

687
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,055
- We are out on the street. - Over there.

688
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:44,555
What's that?

689
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,095
They're wearing white.

690
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:47,495
(What's that?)

691
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:49,395
(What is it?)

692
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:53,155
(They are Japanese police officers.)

693
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,055
They are police officers.

694
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,095
They're Japanese police officers.

695
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,295
- What's going on? - They're policemen.

696
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,195
(The policemen are...)

697
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,495
(coming in from...)

698
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:04,025
(all directions.)

699
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:05,925
- Don't look at them. - What's going on?

700
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,655
Act natural.

701
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,955
Stand up straight. Look natural.

702
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,855
(They are coming nearer.)

703
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:14,995
He has something is his hand.

704
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,795
(What's happening?)

705
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:20,495
Why? Is there a problem?

706
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:22,095
(A dire situation)

707
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,595
We're in a tense situation.

708
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:25,655
They suspect me as...

709
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:27,695
We all should be careful.

710
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:28,795
Hey!

711
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:29,895
(Will they be able to rescue Agent J?)

712
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:33,995
(Chapter 2: The Target)

713
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:36,655
A suspicious...

714
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:38,655
- Look over there! - What's that?

715
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,195
(What is it?)

716
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:41,295
What is it?

717
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:43,795
(What challenge will the Secret Society face?)

718
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,355
- They're wearing white. - What's going on?

719
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,895
- They're wearing white. - Who are they?

720
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:49,425
- They're policemen. - It's the Japanese police.

721
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,995
(A group of men start to swarm the streets.)

722
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:52,555
(The Secret Society's biggest enemy, Japanese police)

723
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,695
- It's the Japanese police. - Why are they here?

724
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:56,155
- We must look suspicious. - We look too suspicious.

725
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:57,425
Be careful with your hat.

726
00:32:57,495 --> 00:32:58,525
Act natural.

727
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,255
The Japanese policemen are here.

728
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,295
- Look away. - They're the police.

729
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:03,795
Act natural.

730
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,895
Cross your arms and look natural.

731
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:07,395
Why are the police...

732
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,255
- They're carrying something. - It must be something of worth.

733
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:12,055
He has something in his hand.

734
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:15,095
- Let's steal it. - They'll make an announcement.

735
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:16,695
See? Look.

736
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:22,655
(If you spot the Secret Society, report to the police immediately.)

737
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:27,395
(Those without an ID will be deemed as a member and will be arrested.)

738
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:28,525
The information that says...

739
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:31,095
the Independence Army arrived in Shanghai must have leaked.

740
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:33,395
- What? - There will be random inspections.

741
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:34,555
(The Japanese police will run random inspections to catch the members,)

742
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,355
- They'll be running inspections. - They'll run random inspections...

743
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,095
and if you don't have an ID card, you will be arrested.

744
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:40,195
- An ID card? - Yes.

745
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:42,795
Fortunately, I know a place that can forge fake ID cards.

746
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,455
- Really? - We need to forge our ID cards?

747
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,195
That means we have to spend money again.

748
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:47,795
On the ground floor of that building...

749
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:50,055
- is a person that can forge IDs. - How much does it cost?

750
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,695
It will cost five cents.

751
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,355
Lend me some money. I'll pay you back.

752
00:33:53,495 --> 00:33:55,425
- Me too. - Lend me just two cents.

753
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,655
- Just two cents. - Me too.

754
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:58,795
That'll be enough for me.

755
00:33:58,795 --> 00:33:59,795
What is that?

756
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:00,895
(A prison car appears in the middle of a street in Shanghai.)

757
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:01,895
What is it?

758
00:34:01,895 --> 00:34:03,095
(A prison car appears in the middle of a street in Shanghai.)

759
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:04,195
Is it a prison?

760
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:06,695
If it's a prison...

761
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,395
The police are over there.

762
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,495
(Without an ID, they will be locked up in the prison.)

763
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,495
(Startled)

764
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:13,655
- They're on their way here. - We need to hide.

765
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:16,155
They're right.

766
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:19,355
- The police are on this street too? - Over there.

767
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:22,095
Let's just go. Act casual.

768
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:26,155
They're coming this way.

769
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:27,355
- They're coming. - It won't work.

770
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:29,725
They've noticed us.

771
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,495
I can't be caught this early on.

772
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:40,795
(He runs across the street.)

773
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:42,625
I need to go that way.

774
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:45,295
But they're so many policemen on that street.

775
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:47,465
I...

776
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,525
(He needs money in order to forge an ID.)

777
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:49,995
I could get caught while trying to earn money.

778
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:51,395
(He needs money in order to forge an ID.)

779
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,795
Ji Sung, where are the games?

780
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,995
I'm looking for the games too.

781
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,425
Ji Sung, come over here.

782
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,155
So Yun, do you know what game it is?

783
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,595
(The Elephant Wrestling game)

784
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:03,655
Oh, no.

785
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:05,525
I'm going to lose this against you.

786
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:11,095
(Let's try it first.)

787
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,095
I can't believe I'm playing this game with Ji Sung.

788
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:15,995
It's an honour.

789
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,895
What am I doing here?

790
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,655
Get ready.

791
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:26,155
Get set. Go!

792
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,425
(The game begins.)

793
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:28,655
Oh, my. So Yun.

794
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:30,695
(Pulling with all her might.)

795
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,195
You are so strong.

796
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:35,795
I can't move.

797
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:40,395
(Korea's best female footballer vs Korean Captain)

798
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:41,595
This is hard.

799
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:44,295
(She doesn't lose easily against Ji Sung.)

800
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:46,395
Goodness.

801
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,895
I'm sorry.

802
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:50,595
Goodness.

803
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,755
(Ji Sung wins the game.)

804
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:53,995
Oh no.

805
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:55,895
I couldn't possibly win.

806
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:57,195
Ji Sung wins.

807
00:35:57,595 --> 00:35:59,155
(They're both out of breath.)

808
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:03,195
(Ji Sung is already out of breath.)

809
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,355
Oh, my.

810
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,555
I'm sorry that I had to do this.

811
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,295
- That was so hard. - Thank you.

812
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,095
I'll give you one.

813
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:12,425
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

814
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:15,795
- Hide it well. - Now we need to go buy the ID.

815
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,995
It's the police. We need to hide.

816
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,095
Oh no, my money.

817
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,895
(She can't afford to drop a single penny.)

818
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:24,995
I should run.

819
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:29,525
(As Jae Seok tries to steal Ji Hyo's money,)

820
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,655
(So Yun pickpockets Jae Seok.)

821
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:33,155
Excuse me, So Yun.

822
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:34,995
How could you?

823
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:37,195
Are you really going to steal from me?

824
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,195
(Jae Seok's tries to steal again.)

825
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:41,295
(So Yun attempts again as well.)

826
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:43,555
Wait. What do you...

827
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,655
What do you think you're doing?

828
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,995
I learned it from you.

829
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:47,995
(I learned it from you.)

830
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,795
You shouldn't have learned to steal.

831
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,195
- Broad-shouldered Gangster. - All right, then.

832
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:54,795
Which way do I go?

833
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:56,795
Gary, do you have money?

834
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:58,195
No, I'm only going to check the place out.

835
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:00,525
Don't lie. I know you have money.

836
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:04,595
- Everyone, Gary has money! - Give me an ID card.

837
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,695
(He pays five cents to forge an ID card.)

838
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,155
Where is Gary?

839
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:10,795
I think he went to buy the ID card.

840
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:12,695
I know.

841
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,465
(The shop is full of customers.)

842
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:18,355
(Will they be able to outrun the Japanese police?)

843
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:19,495
Jang Hui Gun?

844
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:20,655
Oh, Gang Hui Gun.

845
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:21,995
(Gary manages to forge an ID.)

846
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:25,495
(He pronounces his name in Chinese.)

847
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,295
(He repeats it slowly.)

848
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:29,795
Are you sure that's the name you want to take?

849
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,355
You should change your name.

850
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:34,495
It's okay.

851
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,295
Why did you take that name?

852
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,995
- Goodness. - Goodness.

853
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,995
(He pronounces his name in Chinese.)

854
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,525
"Yu Ja Shik"?

855
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:44,595
(They both manage to forge IDs.)

856
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:45,695
It's a relief.

857
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:46,795
(They both manage to forge IDs.)

858
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:49,195
- Oh, my. - This doesn't make sense.

859
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:52,895
- We can't possibly make it. - Stop whining and just do it.

860
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,425
You need to look around.

861
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,555
Goodness.

862
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,255
Run around! Why do you think we're in Running Man?

863
00:37:57,895 --> 00:38:00,195
- Gosh. - Well they at least need to...

864
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,395
tell us something. We don't know anything at all.

865
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:04,095
- How can we possibly... - When have they told us anything?

866
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:05,995
- Really! - Oh, my goodness.

867
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:08,495
There's something fishy about this.

868
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,995
Now I can relax.

869
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,395
(The Japanese police has reinforced the search.)

870
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:16,995
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

871
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:19,625
- Something is not right. - Why?

872
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:21,895
Well, you know...

873
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:23,465
Did you get an ID card?

874
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:24,795
Yes, I did.

875
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,055
Spare me a cent.

876
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,355
I don't have any money left.

877
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:29,725
(The icon of misfortune is penniless.)

878
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,055
I don't have a penny.

879
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,995
- You don't have an ID? - No.

880
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:34,795
(Jong Kook holds on tight.)

881
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,195
(What are you doing?)

882
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,595
What are you doing?

883
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:40,795
Let's see what would happen.

884
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:42,755
(There is a horde of police just ahead of them.)

885
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,395
I can't be caught now.

886
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,195
Jong Kook, don't you remember how...

887
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,055
I helped you out earlier on?

888
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:49,495
(Something caught his eye.)

889
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,195
Hey!

890
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:53,695
(Look here!)

891
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:56,195
Jong Kook, you must be drunk.

892
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:58,055
- I'll take you home. - Officer!

893
00:38:58,095 --> 00:38:59,595
You drank too much.

894
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,495
- Officer! - Why are you doing this to me?

895
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,195
(We're on the same team.)

896
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:04,395
He's gone.

897
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,095
I'm just curious what will happen.

898
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:08,425
Don't do this to me.

899
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:10,655
You can't do this to me.

900
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:13,295
- Hey! - You must be really drunk.

901
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,395
Officer...

902
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,525
(Kwang Soo forcibly seals his lips.)

903
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:22,095
(The Secret Society tries to outrun the police.)

904
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,495
(But the police keeps searching.)

905
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:24,995
They're all over the place.

906
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:31,095
(The police asks for her ID.)

907
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,895
Are you hitting on me?

908
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:34,195
(Are you hitting on me?)

909
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,255
Unfortunately,

910
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:38,295
I'm seeing someone every Monday.

911
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:40,465
Why? What's the matter?

912
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:42,755
The police are everywhere.

913
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:45,095
It must be the joint regulation period.

914
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:47,395
- That's a familiar word. - Isn't it?

915
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:51,195
(The Secret Society will be tied down if this goes on.)

916
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:53,055
No, I'm not.

917
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:55,395
(The Secret Society will be tied down if this goes on.

918
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:01,895
(Meanwhile, at the Shanghai Headquarters)

919
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:06,795
(A message from the Headquarters)

920
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,155
A message?

921
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:10,295
What does it say?

922
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:15,395
Dear Mr Go, director of Shanghai Headquarters,

923
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:18,425
we have obtained a piece of discreet information.

924
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:20,555
We have found out that there is...

925
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,795
a spy within the Secret Society.

926
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:24,465
(A spy?)

927
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:28,795
The spy's name includes J and S.

928
00:40:29,295 --> 00:40:31,895
In order for Agent J's safety...

929
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:37,395
(On top of the Japanese police, they have a spy now.)

930
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:42,255
(Agent J needs to be protected, and there is a spy.)

931
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,625
- We're in trouble! - What's wrong?

932
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:50,355
Jae Seok, there's intelligence that there's a spy among us.

933
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:52,795
- What? - There's a spy.

934
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:55,795
We have just obtained information...

935
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:58,595
that there are letters J and S in the spy's name.

936
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,295
(The initials are the only clue.)

937
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:01,395
J and S?

938
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,895
(If it's a J and S...)

939
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:03,995
Could it be Ji Sung?

940
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:06,095
What?

941
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,695
J and S?

942
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,155
(The others need to know this too.)

943
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:12,195
- Did you hear? - What?

944
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:13,795
There's a spy among us.

945
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,895
The spy's name has the letter J and S.

946
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:20,595
Although my name carries those letters, I'm not the spy.

947
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:23,695
- Me either. - You are the spy.

948
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:24,895
You look the most suspicious.

949
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:25,995
(Ji Sung was previously a spy.)

950
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:28,055
- You look suspicious. - It's not me.

951
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:31,395
Park Ji Sung, Jee Seok Jin, Ji So Yun,

952
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:36,355
Jong Tae Se, Yu Jae Seok and Song Ji Hyo.

953
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:38,525
There's a spy among us?

954
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:41,795
(Who is the spy?)

955
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:44,795
- Why? - What were you talking about?

956
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:46,895
The initials are J and S.

957
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:48,995
Didn't you hear?

958
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:50,895
- The spy? J and S? - Yes.

959
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:51,995
Well, it's not me.

960
00:41:52,395 --> 00:41:53,425
It might be you.

961
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,055
- Stop acting. - It's not me.

962
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:58,695
You must be relieved you're not suspects.

963
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:00,655
You can't be Agent J or the spy.

964
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:02,465
- No. - That's right.

965
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,495
I can be neither of them.

966
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:05,895
- We're not. - You can't be the spy.

967
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:07,995
- You're right. - Are you the spy?

968
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,795
You look suspicious.

969
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,155
- He must be Agent J. - Agent J.

970
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,295
He's more likely to be Agent J.

971
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:13,695
Ji Sung is the spy!

972
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,255
Really.

973
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:16,965
- He's sneaky. - It makes sense.

974
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:18,125
It makes sense.

975
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:19,195
It makes perfect sense.

976
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:21,155
- It's perfect. - People who look alike...

977
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:23,155
He's actually very sneaky.

978
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:24,295
They look alike.

979
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:25,965
I've been a spy once, so...

980
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:28,255
That's why you can do it again.

981
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:29,495
You can do it well.

982
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:31,495
Why do they think I'm the spy?

983
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:33,395
If I go alone, they would suspect me again.

984
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:36,055
The tone of his voice changed completely.

985
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:39,395
You know how he is when he acts, right?

986
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:40,795
I saw it.

987
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:42,855
- He pretends to be relaxed. - Right. I saw it.

988
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:43,995
(Ji Sung is suspicious.)

989
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,695
Hold on.

990
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,255
Isn't he wearing a red scarf?

991
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:48,965
I think he is.

992
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,295
Hello.

993
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:51,495
Wo ai ni.

994
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,195
(He makes a heart with his fingers.)

995
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:57,125
(Jae Seok meets the informant.)

996
00:42:58,395 --> 00:42:59,895
Thank you. Thank you.

997
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:01,895
What's this?

998
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:04,025
(It's a map.)

999
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,095
It's a map.

1000
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:07,395
Wait.

1001
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:12,965
(It's the map of downtown in Shanghai.)

1002
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:16,495
I will briefly tell you about how to obtain information about the funds.

1003
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,795
Tell us quickly.

1004
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,795
You must make sure Agent J makes it back to Manchuria.

1005
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:22,155
- Who is Agent J? - Who is Agent J?

1006
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,395
Is it me, perhaps?

1007
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:24,495
(Their mission is to find the funds and to ensure Agent J's return.)

1008
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:25,995
I almost missed this.

1009
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,795
(They can check the location of the funds with the building number.)

1010
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,855
30-1.

1011
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:30,395
30.

1012
00:43:30,795 --> 00:43:31,895
It's across the tower.

1013
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:34,395
I have to find the highest building.

1014
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,295
That's the one.

1015
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:39,965
That one.

1016
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,125
It's that one, right?

1017
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:44,155
(This is the location of the military funds.)

1018
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:49,225
(Jae Seok enters the building where the funds are hidden.)

1019
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:51,595
It's not here.

1020
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,595
This is 30-1 though.

1021
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:55,895
Oh!

1022
00:43:56,995 --> 00:43:58,095
I found it.

1023
00:43:58,655 --> 00:43:59,755
I found it.

1024
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:20,025
(He just needs to find four more briefcases.)

1025
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:22,995
(Ji Sung also gets the information about the briefcases.)

1026
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:24,195
Let's see.

1027
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,255
(Ji Sung also gets the information about the briefcases.)

1028
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,255
One?

1029
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:27,295
(Ji Sung also gets the information about the briefcases.)

1030
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:29,255
So it's...

1031
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:30,395
(He runs.)

1032
00:44:30,395 --> 00:44:32,595
This used to be a school.

1033
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,895
Is it here?

1034
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:36,755
It should be somewhere around here.

1035
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:39,395
It's this one.

1036
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:42,025
(There it is!)

1037
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:52,895
(Ji Sung gets the second briefcase.)

1038
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:55,495
It's money!

1039
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:57,295
(If Ji Sung is Agent J, the funds will go to the Secret Society.)

1040
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,195
(If he is the spy, the funds will be lost.)

1041
00:44:59,255 --> 00:45:00,655
I need to meet the other members.

1042
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:02,355
(What is his identity?)

1043
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:04,295
2-1. Should I go this way?

1044
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:05,895
(The other members also find out the location of the briefcases.)

1045
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,495
I have to go really far.

1046
00:45:08,995 --> 00:45:11,295
(Seok Jin got the map from the informant too.)

1047
00:45:12,195 --> 00:45:13,225
What is this?

1048
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,395
39-2?

1049
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,295
- Seok Jin! - He must have found the money.

1050
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,495
Seok Jin!

1051
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:20,595
Why are you running away?

1052
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:21,855
- Hey! - He's betraying us.

1053
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:22,995
Look at him.

1054
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:24,295
Where is he going?

1055
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:25,795
We should help each other.

1056
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:29,725
(Is Seok Jin the spy?)

1057
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:30,955
This is life.

1058
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,195
This is life, you know.

1059
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:35,695
They are all looking for the briefcases.

1060
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:37,895
Are those the military funds?

1061
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:39,055
(The location of the military funds are being revealed.)

1062
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:42,695
Why is the spy not taking any actions?

1063
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:43,995
(Agent J doesn't know that he is the Agent J.)

1064
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,225
The spy must do something...

1065
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:49,025
to get in the way.

1066
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:53,595
The spy is lying low. Nobody got eliminated yet.

1067
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:57,295
Why is he doing that?

1068
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:59,755
The spy must have his mission.

1069
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:01,295
(Perhaps he's waiting until all the funds are gathered?)

1070
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:03,095
Kwang Soo, come here.

1071
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,695
Right now,

1072
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,395
you, me,

1073
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:09,755
Gary and Jong Kook are...

1074
00:46:09,795 --> 00:46:11,295
neither Agent J nor the spy.

1075
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:12,695
Our names don't include the letters J or S.

1076
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:15,695
We are neither of those because our names don't include J or S.

1077
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,395
He's on our side. He's our comrade.

1078
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:20,155
- We have to be on the same side. - We are comrades.

1079
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:21,225
Let's share the hints then.

1080
00:46:21,295 --> 00:46:23,395
- Let's share the hints. - I got one.

1081
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,155
- Did you get a map? - I didn't get it yet.

1082
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:26,395
There he is.

1083
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:30,255
(What will their first shared information say?)

1084
00:46:31,895 --> 00:46:32,955
What does it say?

1085
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:34,795
"Claim all the funds,"

1086
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:38,225
"take the car at the designated location,"

1087
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,595
"cross the bridge at the appointed time..."

1088
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,095
"and go to Manchuria."

1089
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:44,495
- A bridge? - There's a bridge.

1090
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:45,755
- Bridge! - There's a bridge.

1091
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:46,995
Let's head towards the bridge.

1092
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,695
- Oh, that bridge. - That bridge.

1093
00:46:48,795 --> 00:46:50,495
I saw the bridge before.

1094
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:52,195
- Where is it? - It's right over there.

1095
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:53,755
- Let's go there. - We have to go there quickly.

1096
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:56,025
Let's look for the bridge.

1097
00:46:56,095 --> 00:46:57,195
It's here.

1098
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:00,795
Seok Jin...

1099
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:02,595
This is it.

1100
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,695
- Is this the church? - Hold on.

1101
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,795
It said "the end of the bridge".

1102
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:06,995
The end of the bridge?

1103
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:09,295
We don't know which end it is.

1104
00:47:09,595 --> 00:47:13,155
- Let's cross it first. - It must be the other end.

1105
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:15,595
This is the country border, so you can't cross it.

1106
00:47:15,655 --> 00:47:16,795
What?

1107
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:18,895
That's even stranger.

1108
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,295
- That's strange. - How can we cross it?

1109
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:21,795
This must be it.

1110
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:22,955
This must be the bridge.

1111
00:47:23,755 --> 00:47:25,795
We have the key, and we found the bridge.

1112
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,595
Where are you going?

1113
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:29,895
I came because I saw you.

1114
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:31,095
(The four and So Yun meet.)

1115
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:32,355
Do you have money? How much do you have?

1116
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:34,495
- I have four cents. - Join us.

1117
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:35,895
That makes six cents.

1118
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:37,155
- What? - Six cents.

1119
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:38,595
- Wo ai ni. - Wo ai ni.

1120
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,725
Wo ai ni.

1121
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:41,395
Wo ai ni.

1122
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:43,295
Gosh. Hurry up.

1123
00:47:43,395 --> 00:47:44,495
How much do you have?

1124
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,795
Just give us one cent.

1125
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,095
Kwang Soo, you said you have one. Take it out.

1126
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:50,295
- Put them together. - Don't let her read it.

1127
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:52,655
(What did you say?)

1128
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:54,295
Only one of us four can read it.

1129
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:56,895
I am sorry, So Yun.

1130
00:47:56,955 --> 00:47:58,025
We will read it and tell you the hint.

1131
00:47:58,095 --> 00:47:59,225
We will read it and tell you the hint.

1132
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:00,795
- I think I'm tricked. - This way, we'll get more options.

1133
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:03,495
Thank you.

1134
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,195
Thank you.

1135
00:48:05,295 --> 00:48:07,125
- Thank you. - It's really long.

1136
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:09,395
It's not something we can figure out on our own.

1137
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:10,655
We need an interpreter.

1138
00:48:10,695 --> 00:48:11,695
Isn't that a surname?

1139
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:12,855
- Kang? - Isn't it "left"?

1140
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,225
- So Yun, give me a cent. - It's the letter "bang".

1141
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,195
- Please give us one more cent. - You don't have money?

1142
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:18,495
No. I only have one.

1143
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,255
- I... - Lend us some money.

1144
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,595
Since So Yun has money,

1145
00:48:22,955 --> 00:48:24,195
we are sorry, but...

1146
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:26,155
- We are sorry. - We're taking all her money.

1147
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:27,795
We will give you our hint.

1148
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:29,495
Give it to us if you are not the spy.

1149
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:31,095
- It will prove that you're not. - It will prove it.

1150
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:32,195
- It will prove your innocence. - You can prove it.

1151
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,395
It's obvious that you are not Agent J.

1152
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:35,395
- She's not. - This is how you rob money.

1153
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,655
- No. - We are not robbing you.

1154
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:37,755
- Please. - We will pay you back.

1155
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:40,695
- Wo ai ni. - Where are you going?

1156
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,155
(With So Yun's money, they afford another interpreter.)

1157
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:45,125
(I'm coming too.)

1158
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:48,195
Please read it.

1159
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:49,725
(What does the hint say?)

1160
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,125
"His wife..."

1161
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,125
"has worked..."

1162
00:48:54,195 --> 00:48:55,395
"for a TV station."

1163
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,755
It applies to both Ji Sung and Jae Seok.

1164
00:48:57,955 --> 00:48:59,725
Seok Jin's wife used to be a stylist too.

1165
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:00,795
She was a stylist too.

1166
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:06,495
(Who is Agent J?)

1167
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:09,955
- It's either Jae Seok or... - Everyone knows that...

1168
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:11,255
Ji Sung.

1169
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:12,595
Ji Sung can be the one.

1170
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:14,195
It's confusing.

1171
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:18,095
(Among the six people, who is the spy?)

1172
00:49:20,755 --> 00:49:22,695
Then is Jae Seok...

1173
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:24,855
the spy?

1174
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,155
(Is Jae Seok the spy?)

1175
00:49:26,155 --> 00:49:27,395
There is a good chance.

1176
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:29,495
Most likely it's either Jae Seok or Tae Se.

1177
00:49:30,225 --> 00:49:31,255
I think it's one of them.

1178
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:33,495
Isn't the spy's mission to rip Agent J's name tag?

1179
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:35,795
Isn't that the spy's mission?

1180
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:36,995
(People keep wondering about the spy.)

1181
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:40,495
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok gets out with the briefcase.)

1182
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:43,495
Hey.

1183
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:45,025
What are you carrying?

1184
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:48,495
This is...

1185
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,225
This is the funds we are looking for.

1186
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,095
- Come here. - Let me see it.

1187
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:53,755
- Seok Jin. - Yes.

1188
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:54,955
(The police might see them, so they hide.)

1189
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,755
- I think... - Aren't you the spy?

1190
00:49:56,795 --> 00:49:58,095
Your name includes J and S too.

1191
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,395
Your name does too.

1192
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:02,355
I know that I'm one of the suspects.

1193
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:03,595
But I think...

1194
00:50:05,225 --> 00:50:06,255
it's either Ji Sung...

1195
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:07,495
Yes.

1196
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:09,295
Or Tae Se.

1197
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:13,695
I think one of them is Agent J and the other one is the spy.

1198
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:15,395
I agree.

1199
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,695
Let's open that briefcase.

1200
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:19,595
Show me what's inside.

1201
00:50:19,995 --> 00:50:20,995
No, I can't do that.

1202
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,355
- I'll take a quick look. - I can't tell you any more.

1203
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,495
I can hear the plastic coins in the briefcase.

1204
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:26,655
I found this as everyone was suspecting me.

1205
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:29,195
- Right. - I endured Jong Kook's abuse.

1206
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:30,795
You know what he did to me?

1207
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,095
Let's eliminate Jong Kook.

1208
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,225
(Let's eliminate Jong Kook.)

1209
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,795
Wouldn't that make us look like the spies?

1210
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:37,695
What if we act like the spies?

1211
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:39,795
We can just do it.

1212
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:44,025
- Wait. - What do you say?

1213
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,955
That's a very good plan.

1214
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:48,255
We are not the spies, but we can act like the spies.

1215
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:49,955
That's a very good plan.

1216
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:51,295
Since we are already being suspected,

1217
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:52,755
- let's act like spies. - Let's do this.

1218
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:56,495
- Let's eliminate Jong Kook. - First, let's target the four.

1219
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:57,495
(First, let's target the four.)

1220
00:50:57,495 --> 00:50:58,495
That's a great idea.

1221
00:50:58,595 --> 00:50:59,755
Let's get a revenge.

1222
00:51:00,395 --> 00:51:02,855
- I really... - Gary, Haha,

1223
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:04,055
Jong Kook and...

1224
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,295
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1225
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:06,855
Let's rip their name tags first.

1226
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:07,895
Okay.

1227
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:09,495
- Team Yu Jee. - Team Yu Jee.

1228
00:51:09,595 --> 00:51:10,655
It means "to maintain".

1229
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:12,055
Let's maintain our friendship.

1230
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,295
- Team Yu Jee. - Team Yu Jee.

1231
00:51:13,295 --> 00:51:14,295
- Cross! - Cross!

1232
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:15,595
- Let's maintain... - Let's maintain...

1233
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:16,755
our friendship.

1234
00:51:16,795 --> 00:51:17,995
- Let's maintain our... - Let's maintain our...

1235
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:19,155
- trust. - trust.

1236
00:51:20,025 --> 00:51:21,855
- Gosh... - Let's eliminate them.

1237
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,595
They must be together. There they are.

1238
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:26,495
- Where? - There is someone.

1239
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,125
I should rip it right away.

1240
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:29,395
Haha and Kwang Soo are there.

1241
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,495
Don't we have to rip Jong Kook's name tag first?

1242
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:32,695
Gosh.

1243
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:35,695
But they are together right now.

1244
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:37,655
- So it's hard to target them. - They are always together.

1245
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:39,125
Where did you find that?

1246
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,295
What do you mean where?

1247
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:42,395
I got the hints and worked hard to find it.

1248
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,395
What is that?

1249
00:51:44,495 --> 00:51:45,495
What's what?

1250
00:51:45,595 --> 00:51:47,495
(Let's talk.)

1251
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:50,395
(Does he think I am the spy?)

1252
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:53,195
(The game is over.)

1253
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:54,255
J.

1254
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:56,395
- Yes. - J.

1255
00:51:56,495 --> 00:51:57,595
Let's get you out of here.

1256
00:51:58,025 --> 00:51:59,055
(What? I'm Agent J?)

1257
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,395
Let's escape this place.

1258
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:02,195
Look. His eyes are tiny.

1259
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:03,495
It's even worse when he takes off his glasses.

1260
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:05,295
Take your glasses off. Come on.

1261
00:52:05,295 --> 00:52:06,755
- I really... - His eyes are so tiny.

1262
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:07,795
I...

1263
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:09,225
Honestly, you think those eyes are not small?

1264
00:52:09,395 --> 00:52:10,495
- They are bigger than mine, - I...

1265
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,695
- I am confused. - Let's compare the size.

1266
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:14,625
- His are smaller than mine, right? - Hey, come on.

1267
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:16,325
Why are you coming near me?

1268
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:17,395
No. Let's just compare them.

1269
00:52:17,455 --> 00:52:18,495
- Don't be like that. - Come one.

1270
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:19,725
Let's compare objectively.

1271
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,025
- What are you trying to do? - Take your glasses off.

1272
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,125
Why was your hand near my back?

1273
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:25,525
Am I Agent J?

1274
00:52:26,095 --> 00:52:28,225
- Hey. - He's Agent J.

1275
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:30,095
- Jae Seok. - It is him.

1276
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,225
You must be Agent J.

1277
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:32,655
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok. - Wait, hold on.

1278
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:33,925
Don't come near me.

1279
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,225
Excuse me.

1280
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:36,695
Tae Se is the spy.

1281
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:38,125
What's in your hands?

1282
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,025
- I got a hint. - It's Ji Sung.

1283
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,325
I don't think he's the spy.

1284
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,655
He keeps sharing the hint.

1285
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:44,525
- What is it? - What does it say?

1286
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:45,725
- Hey. - What is it?

1287
00:52:45,825 --> 00:52:47,395
- This is... - Let's ask the interpreter.

1288
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,625
Hello. Please translate this for us.

1289
00:52:48,695 --> 00:52:49,725
Show him.

1290
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:51,225
What does this mean?

1291
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:54,695
"Agent J can run very well on grass."

1292
00:52:54,825 --> 00:52:56,825
- He can run on grass? - Yes.

1293
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:58,555
He must be a football player.

1294
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,125
- Yes, it's a football player. - It's Ji Sung then.

1295
00:53:00,195 --> 00:53:02,695
- It's Ji Sung. - It's either him or Ji Sung.

1296
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,825
Has your wife ever worked at a broadcasting station?

1297
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:05,925
- It's not him. - It's Ji Sung.

1298
00:53:06,025 --> 00:53:07,195
It's not you.

1299
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,125
- But he's the grasshopper. - He is.

1300
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:11,225
(Excuse me. I'm the grasshopper.)

1301
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,825
- A grasshopper hops on the grass. - Oh.

1302
00:53:13,825 --> 00:53:15,455
So it could be Jae Seok.

1303
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,725
Grasshoppers hop on grass.

1304
00:53:17,725 --> 00:53:19,725
They both fit the description so well.

1305
00:53:20,725 --> 00:53:24,655
(I'm Captain Park of the football field.)

1306
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:28,925
(I'm the grasshopper who lives on grass.)

1307
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:31,755
(I'm the impala who sprints across the field.)

1308
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:34,495
- His nickname is grasshopper. - And they hop on grass.

1309
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:36,325
- It could be him. - Agent J is Ji Sung.

1310
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:37,925
- It's dangerous here. - So Yun!

1311
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:40,025
- Let's get out of here. - We are narrowing down...

1312
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:41,325
to Jae Seok and Ji Sung.

1313
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:44,395
One of them has to be Agent J.

1314
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,125
Jae Seok might be the spy.

1315
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:47,325
- Seok Jin. - Gosh. You...

1316
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,925
- need to be careful. - Jong Kook's hand went for my back.

1317
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:51,525
- Yes, I saw. - My goodness.

1318
00:53:51,825 --> 00:53:52,825
We have to...

1319
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:55,025
- make a move or they'll get us. - We have to get their name tags...

1320
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,225
- before they get the chance. - If it turns out we're not spies,

1321
00:53:57,295 --> 00:53:58,295
- they'll just say "You're not it." - "You're not it."

1322
00:53:58,325 --> 00:54:00,595
- "Sorry". - That's it.

1323
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,825
Jong Kook will say, "Why were you acting suspiciously then?"

1324
00:54:03,225 --> 00:54:04,225
"Why were you on your own?"

1325
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,655
He suspects me when I go off on my own,

1326
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:09,925
but when I'm with him, he says I look at him in a strange way.

1327
00:54:10,525 --> 00:54:12,095
Jong Kook is the problem.

1328
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,095
Let's get started.

1329
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:15,295
(Let's get started.)

1330
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,325
We shouldn't stand out.

1331
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:19,725
(They begin their hunt!)

1332
00:54:19,825 --> 00:54:20,825
Let's execute our plan.

1333
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,325
Okay.

1334
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,495
Let's get Kwang Soo first.

1335
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:24,595
(Their first target is Kwang Soo.)

1336
00:54:24,655 --> 00:54:25,925
Are there any more missions left?

1337
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:28,825
Kwang Soo.

1338
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,125
- Do you have any money? - What?

1339
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:32,225
Do you have money?

1340
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:33,525
What money? I have nothing.

1341
00:54:33,595 --> 00:54:35,295
You don't have any, do you?

1342
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:36,725
You should look in places like this.

1343
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:39,225
Kwang Soo.

1344
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:41,295
Do you have...

1345
00:54:42,295 --> 00:54:44,125
- any briefcase... - Hold on.

1346
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,395
(They got him on one try.)

1347
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,125
I'm sorry.

1348
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:50,525
Here you go.

1349
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:52,195
We're not spies though.

1350
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:53,825
- I'm not the spy. - Remember that.

1351
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,455
- Why did you rip my name tag? - So we can protect ourselves.

1352
00:54:56,725 --> 00:54:58,595
- What? - You guys were doubting us.

1353
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:01,125
- When did I... - Go away.

1354
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:02,625
(How could you?)

1355
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:06,725
(He kicks them out of frustration.)

1356
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:13,395
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1357
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,025
One down.

1358
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,495
Let's just rip all their name tags.

1359
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,025
- It's okay if we lose near the end. - Let's just do it.

1360
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:22,495
How could they doubt us?

1361
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:24,725
- Don't worry about losing. - You're all doomed!

1362
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:26,725
- We are out of control. - We are.

1363
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:28,595
- We are out of our minds. - We are out of our minds.

1364
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,825
I'll seriously rip all their name tags.

1365
00:55:31,025 --> 00:55:32,125
We have to start now.

1366
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,825
- Let's get started. - It'll never end otherwise.

1367
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:35,295
Look. It's Tae Se.

1368
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:36,495
Tae Se.

1369
00:55:36,555 --> 00:55:37,825
I thought you shouldn't go around in groups.

1370
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:39,725
We're not a group. I just bumped into him.

1371
00:55:39,825 --> 00:55:40,925
Where is Ji Sung?

1372
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,725
I have no clue. I didn't see him at all.

1373
00:55:44,195 --> 00:55:45,595
I don't know what to do.

1374
00:55:46,325 --> 00:55:48,525
I think Agent J is either me or Ji Sung.

1375
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,725
It's either of you, right?

1376
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:51,325
Yes, probably.

1377
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,125
(He approaches Tae Se.)

1378
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:54,425
What's in your briefcase?

1379
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,825
Try shaking it.

1380
00:55:56,295 --> 00:55:58,125
It's just coins.

1381
00:55:58,195 --> 00:55:59,725
(He hesitates.)

1382
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:02,395
- You had the same thing? - You as well?

1383
00:56:02,555 --> 00:56:04,325
Then...

1384
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:07,725
Agent J is...

1385
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:09,455
What? wait a second.

1386
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,195
(Ripping.)

1387
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:14,195
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1388
00:56:14,225 --> 00:56:15,425
- Are you okay, Tae Se? - I'm fine.

1389
00:56:15,495 --> 00:56:17,025
- We have to leave. - Let's go.

1390
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:19,095
They'll get suspicious again.

1391
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:20,725
- Did you bring everything? - Yes, I did.

1392
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:22,295
Seok Jin, you've got the other one, right?

1393
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,125
We have to get Jong Kook.

1394
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:26,025
Yes, we need to get rid of him.

1395
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:27,825
- Dreams come true. - Good job.

1396
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:28,825
Great job.

1397
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:31,195
(Our next target is Jong Kook.)

1398
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:33,725
(Jong Kook is meeting Ji Sung.)

1399
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:36,125
Hey! Where did you find it?

1400
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:37,925
- In that building. - What?

1401
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:39,325
It was one the second floor.

1402
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:41,525
We've found all the briefcases then.

1403
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:43,595
- Have we? - Yes. Haha!

1404
00:56:43,655 --> 00:56:45,655
- Yes? - We found all the briefcases.

1405
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:48,455
- Ji Sung found the last one? - Yes, the fifth one.

1406
00:56:48,925 --> 00:56:50,525
Let's see how things are going.

1407
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:54,425
You thought I was the spy, right?

1408
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:56,825
No. I'm just focusing on protecting Agent J.

1409
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:58,695
Be careful.

1410
00:56:58,725 --> 00:57:00,125
I told you I'm not the spy.

1411
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:01,455
Be careful though.

1412
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:03,025
I trust you. I do.

1413
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,195
The policemen are coming this way.

1414
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:07,225
Ji Sung must be the spy, right?

1415
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,225
Gosh. This is a hostile situation.

1416
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,655
I wouldn't have acted this way as a spy.

1417
00:57:11,725 --> 00:57:13,695
There's a very high chance that you're the spy.

1418
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,925
- Me? - Yes.

1419
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:19,595
- Gosh. - You're acting very suspiciously.

1420
00:57:19,725 --> 00:57:21,695
I'm not the spy. I swear.

1421
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:23,825
I'm really not the one.

1422
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,395
I don't know what to do.

1423
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:29,325
I'm so confused.

1424
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:31,225
(Who should I trust?)

1425
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:32,555
Hey, Jae Seok.

1426
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,825
- Let's not dissolve our plan. - Wait. Time out!

1427
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:36,595
Time out. Time out.

1428
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:38,325
Let's do this.

1429
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:41,025
- What shall we do? - We are being too doubtful.

1430
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:43,455
You know for sure I'm not the spy.

1431
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:45,125
- I know. - Of course not.

1432
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,555
Put the briefcases in the centre.

1433
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,725
Gary and I will be in charge of them since we're not spies.

1434
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,195
- All right. - We are neither spies nor Agent J.

1435
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:52,225
- Okay. - All right.

1436
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:54,295
We know that for certain.

1437
00:57:54,695 --> 00:57:56,455
Place them here. Trust us.

1438
00:57:56,525 --> 00:57:57,655
We'll take care of them.

1439
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,325
You know we are not spies.

1440
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:01,095
Let us take care of them.

1441
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:04,295
- Good. - Let's put them in a car.

1442
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:05,695
In which car will you put them?

1443
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:06,925
Put them in this one.

1444
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,725
Why did you just ask that question?

1445
00:58:08,825 --> 00:58:11,025
- Pardon? - Why do you want to know?

1446
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:12,195
I need to know where they will be.

1447
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:14,295
- Unless you are the spy... - Something is fishy here!

1448
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:16,225
Doesn't Agent J have to collect all the briefcases?

1449
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,555
- The thing is... - You can just send them away.

1450
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,495
Why did you want to know where they will be now?

1451
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:22,555
- Me? - Oh.

1452
00:58:23,025 --> 00:58:24,425
Something is not right.

1453
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:28,325
(Jae Seok is at loss for words.)

1454
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:30,825
(My intuition was right.)

1455
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:32,925
(Who's the real spy?)

1456
00:58:33,195 --> 00:58:34,195
Load them on a car first.

1457
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:35,525
- Okay. - Good plan.

1458
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,455
It's either Ji Sung...

1459
00:58:37,525 --> 00:58:39,455
Those whose name doesn't include J and S should...

1460
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:40,595
- put them somewhere. - Let's go.

1461
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:42,095
Let's go on our separate ways.

1462
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,655
I think it's Ji Sung.

1463
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:47,295
I'm more confused now.

1464
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:50,625
The hint about the grass is confusing.

1465
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:51,695
(The identity of the spy is in question.)

1466
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,825
Isn't it obviously Ji Sung?

1467
00:58:54,225 --> 00:58:56,295
He keeps on trying to lure people.

1468
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,825
Yes, exactly.

1469
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:01,455
That's what spies do.

1470
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:05,295
Why are they all doubting me?

1471
00:59:06,655 --> 00:59:08,225
It's probably because I'm going off on my own.

1472
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:09,595
Because of me...

1473
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:15,395
There's no other way.

1474
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,495
I need to start eliminating people.

1475
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:20,925
(Seok Jin is the unsuspected spy?)

1476
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:26,225
Jae Seok and I are the only suspects.

1477
00:59:27,325 --> 00:59:29,725
Don't look at me like that!

1478
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,825
- I mean... - I'm not the spy.

1479
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:34,325
Where have you been all this time?

1480
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:36,695
When you were out of sight,

1481
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:37,925
two people got eliminated.

1482
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:40,595
I haven't even seen Tae Se or Kwang Soo.

1483
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:42,925
I'm dying to know what happened as well.

1484
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:45,425
(She's unsure.)

1485
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,195
(Let's see.)

1486
00:59:55,455 --> 00:59:58,925
I should finish it off.

1487
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:02,625
(What could he possibly mean?)

1488
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:05,455
- Hurry! - Rip it off!

1489
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:06,655
You're acting suspiciously.

1490
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:07,825
I was startled.

1491
01:00:07,825 --> 01:00:09,125
Something's fishy!

1492
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:10,455
I think Ji Sung is the spy.

1493
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:11,825
We have no choice but to end it.

1494
01:00:13,825 --> 01:00:16,295
(Chapter 3: The Identity of "J")

1495
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:17,325
Jae Seok.

1496
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:20,025
The more I think about it,

1497
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,655
the more certain I get that you're Agent J.

1498
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,125
- I think so as well. - You must be Agent J.

1499
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:24,455
But I'm not certain.

1500
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:25,825
Ji Sung has been acting weirdly.

1501
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:27,625
I can see in your expressions...

1502
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:29,725
that you're not the spy.

1503
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,195
You're Agent J.

1504
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:33,725
It's you, Jae Seok.

1505
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:35,395
- Seok Jin. - It's you.

1506
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,725
- Be careful. - Okay.

1507
01:00:36,725 --> 01:00:38,295
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin maintain their alliance.)

1508
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:42,825
My goodness.

1509
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:46,455
(Why does Seok Jin completely trust me now?)

1510
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:51,025
- Ji Sung. - Yes?

1511
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,125
What are you doing? Why are you coming near me?

1512
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:55,455
If you're planning to eliminate me by any chance,
subtitles ripped by riri13

1513
01:00:55,525 --> 01:00:57,325
I will not let you.

1514
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:58,925
I just want to speak with you.

1515
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:01,555
- About what? - We have to find Agent J, right?

1516
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,825
- Right. - So...

1517
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,625
Agent J has a child, and...

1518
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:07,095
his wife worked in the broadcasting station. He's a man...

1519
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,025
- Correct. - and has small eyes.

1520
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,825
- These clues... - It's either Jae Seok...

1521
01:01:10,925 --> 01:01:11,925
or you, obviously.

1522
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:13,655
- So we only have these four clues. - Yes.

1523
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:15,825
And you still think I'm the spy?

1524
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:18,025
No, I'm suspecting both of you.

1525
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,555
So you think it's one of us?

1526
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:22,595
Right. And the other one is Agent J.

1527
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:23,825
That's what it comes down to.

1528
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:26,395
This is what everybody is assuming.

1529
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:30,095
If I start acting up, then I would look like the spy, right?

1530
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,025
(Twitching)

1531
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:34,295
Well... Yes, of course.

1532
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:35,725
(He's very suspicious.)

1533
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,825
If you're the spy, you'd better go and find...

1534
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,225
another target.

1535
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:42,655
I'll never let you eliminate me.

1536
01:01:43,025 --> 01:01:45,125
Hey. Is it you or me?

1537
01:01:45,525 --> 01:01:46,555
Who is this Agent J?

1538
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,325
I have no clue.

1539
01:01:48,425 --> 01:01:49,925
I don't know if it's you...

1540
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:51,755
- or me. - Do we not have any more hints?

1541
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:54,025
You two make the decision then.

1542
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:57,125
This game ends when Agent J is eliminated anyway.

1543
01:01:57,455 --> 01:01:58,925
You two just fight and end the game.

1544
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:00,595
Agent J is not supposed to be eliminated though.

1545
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,195
- He shouldn't. - I know.

1546
01:02:02,225 --> 01:02:03,725
Of course.

1547
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:05,655
Where is Seok Jin?

1548
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:07,325
He's acting weird.

1549
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:09,025
What are you up to?

1550
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,355
- I'm not being weird. - What are you doing?

1551
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:11,525
I'm nothing.

1552
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:12,695
- Seok Jin. - Hey.

1553
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:15,295
- I'm not it. - Can I rip his name tag?

1554
01:02:15,325 --> 01:02:16,795
- Please? - I'm not the one.

1555
01:02:16,825 --> 01:02:18,095
- He is a suspect. - Right.

1556
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:19,425
(Oh goodness.)

1557
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:21,255
He is a suspect,

1558
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,255
but he's the least likely to be Agent J.

1559
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,525
- He could be the spy. - He is a suspect,

1560
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:26,625
but he can't be Agent J.

1561
01:02:26,725 --> 01:02:28,325
- Seok Jin could be the spy. - We have to rip his tag.

1562
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:30,295
No, don't do that.

1563
01:02:30,325 --> 01:02:32,825
- Why not? - Jong Kook,

1564
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:34,425
- whatever we do, - Yes.

1565
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:36,025
we just have to help Agent J escape.

1566
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:37,525
- The rest doesn't matter. - Right.

1567
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,695
- Oh, no. - This isn't good.

1568
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,225
- Where is he going? - It doesn't feel right.

1569
01:02:40,295 --> 01:02:41,295
- Why is he running? - It doesn't feel right.

1570
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:43,925
- It doesn't seem right. - Ji Sung, get him.

1571
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,995
- Rip his name tag. - Well,

1572
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,425
what do I have to do?

1573
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:50,925
Ji Sung, you run fast so you should catch him.

1574
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:53,525
- So Yun, we have to rip his tag. - Run!

1575
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,825
We can't stand around.

1576
01:02:56,295 --> 01:02:57,995
(He runs away.)

1577
01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:04,225
(Is Seok Jin the spy?)

1578
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:05,725
Poor Seok Jin.

1579
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:06,925
(Poor Seok Jin.)

1580
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:09,025
(What does he mean?)

1581
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:10,925
- Rip his tag. - Go.

1582
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:12,525
We can't just stand around.

1583
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:15,425
Is it me? Who is it?

1584
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,625
Just take me out then.

1585
01:03:17,695 --> 01:03:19,525
- I think you're Agent J. - Really?

1586
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:20,925
That's my guess.

1587
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:22,025
Are there any more hints?

1588
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:23,625
I think you're Agent J.

1589
01:03:24,195 --> 01:03:26,325
- I think you are. - But you don't know for sure.

1590
01:03:26,695 --> 01:03:27,725
It's either...

1591
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:30,895
you or Seok Jin.

1592
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:33,825
So let's take everyone out...

1593
01:03:33,895 --> 01:03:34,995
except you two.

1594
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:36,925
- We have to get Seok Jin. - Okay.

1595
01:03:36,995 --> 01:03:38,325
Let's go and find him.

1596
01:03:38,425 --> 01:03:40,255
- I think he's hiding. - What is it?

1597
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:41,355
(Will Seok Jin turn out to be the spy?)

1598
01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:42,625
- Who is it? - What?

1599
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:44,025
- Who is that? - Who?

1600
01:03:44,095 --> 01:03:45,125
That's Seok Jin.

1601
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,425
(Jae Seok is nervous because he might be Agent J.)

1602
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:48,225
- We need to catch him. - What?

1603
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:49,425
He's running away.

1604
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:53,155
(What is happening?)

1605
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:54,225
Hey.

1606
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:56,825
(Jae Seok attacks.)

1607
01:03:56,925 --> 01:03:57,925
Hey.

1608
01:03:58,155 --> 01:04:00,255
Be quiet.

1609
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:03,325
(Jong Kook is out.)

1610
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:07,625
(Why did he take my tag? I was helping him.)

1611
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:09,325
Take him away.

1612
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:12,425
(Could it be?)

1613
01:04:12,525 --> 01:04:14,695
- I can't believe it. - Go.

1614
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,525
Take that with you.

1615
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:18,055
I wanted to rip your name tag from the beginning.

1616
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,195
Jong Kook,

1617
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:21,025
stay quiet.

1618
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,225
(Is Jae Seok the spy?)

1619
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,725
(Jae Seok is the spy!)

1620
01:04:31,255 --> 01:04:33,725
(All the members of the Secret Society got a mission.)

1621
01:04:33,825 --> 01:04:36,325
- "Dear Secret Society..." - "Dear Secret Society..."

1622
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:37,625
"Dear Secret Society..."

1623
01:04:37,925 --> 01:04:40,425
"Retrieve all the funds that K hid..."

1624
01:04:40,525 --> 01:04:41,625
"Retrieve all the funds that K hid..."

1625
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:44,525
- "and return to Manchuria." - "and return to Manchuria."

1626
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:47,195
(But Jae Seok...)

1627
01:04:47,255 --> 01:04:48,695
A spy?

1628
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:50,425
(He was a spy.)

1629
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:54,055
"You are a spy from a neutral state."

1630
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,625
(He was given a mission to stop the Secret Society.)

1631
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,525
"Take the military funds..."

1632
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,425
"from the Secret Society..."

1633
01:05:00,525 --> 01:05:02,225
"and bring it to your state."

1634
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:03,825
"If the Secret Society suspects you,"

1635
01:05:03,925 --> 01:05:05,325
"you should eliminate them and hide your identity."

1636
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,625
(He has to take the military funds and get the Secret Society too.)

1637
01:05:09,325 --> 01:05:12,625
(Jae Seok was the spy.)

1638
01:05:13,295 --> 01:05:14,925
As a spy,

1639
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:16,625
I need to be in their sight at all times.

1640
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:18,725
They won't be suspicious then.

1641
01:05:20,325 --> 01:05:22,055
(He gets the military funds.)

1642
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,325
I will take out the Secret Society.

1643
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:25,625
(He plans to eliminate the Secret Society.)

1644
01:05:25,725 --> 01:05:28,025
Jong Kook. Kwang Soo.

1645
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,025
Haha. Gary.

1646
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,725
- So what if we act like spies? - Right.

1647
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:38,055
We aren't spies, but we can act like spies.

1648
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,725
Let's do it.

1649
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:40,995
(Jae Seok...)

1650
01:05:41,055 --> 01:05:42,525
(manipulated Seok Jin.)

1651
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:46,225
(Jae Seok had him eliminate Tae Se.)

1652
01:05:47,225 --> 01:05:48,325
Why did you just ask that question?

1653
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,055
I have to know.

1654
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,725
Something is fishy here.

1655
01:05:52,155 --> 01:05:53,195
- Load them first. - Okay.

1656
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:54,255
All right.

1657
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:58,995
(He makes a decision.)

1658
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,325
I have to end it now.

1659
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:01,995
(I have to end it now.)

1660
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,425
(The spy is on the move!)

1661
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:10,195
(He has to get rid of Agent J in order to win.)

1662
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:13,625
(Is Ji Sung Agent J?)

1663
01:06:13,725 --> 01:06:17,225
(Or is it Seok Jin Agent J?)

1664
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:21,795
(He doesn't have big eyes.)

1665
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,525
(He has a kid.)

1666
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:27,425
(His wife used to work for a broadcasting station.)

1667
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:29,825
(He runs well on grass.)

1668
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:34,125
(Who is Agent J?)

1669
01:06:34,195 --> 01:06:35,625
I have to escape with Agent J.

1670
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,825
I knew this was going to happen.

1671
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:41,095
I had to run away. I'm sorry.

1672
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:44,995
(He still believes Jae Seok is Agent J.)

1673
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:51,155
(Seok Jin forms an alliance with the spy.)

1674
01:06:51,255 --> 01:06:54,795
(They formed Team Yu Jee together.)

1675
01:06:54,825 --> 01:06:57,255
- Let's maintain our friendship. - Let's maintain our friendship.

1676
01:06:57,325 --> 01:06:59,255
- Let's maintain our trust. - Let's maintain our trust.

1677
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,295
Let's get everyone else.

1678
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:05,255
(Jae Seok urges Seok Jin to get rid of the Secret Society.)

1679
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:07,825
(Seok Jin follows the orders.)

1680
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:09,725
I think you're Agent J.

1681
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,295
Ji Sung has been acting weird.

1682
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:12,925
I think you're Agent J.

1683
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,695
- Why are you two together? - Because...

1684
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:19,725
- I'm probably Agent J. - I'm helping Agent J.

1685
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:20,825
- Agent J! - Wait.

1686
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:22,295
Wait for me. I'm not the spy.

1687
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:23,725
Agent J!

1688
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:25,725
Agent J!

1689
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:28,095
(Seok Jin was completely blind.)

1690
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:31,895
- Seok Jin. - What?

1691
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:33,295
Why do you run away?

1692
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:35,425
- They're trying to rip my name tag. - Why?

1693
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:37,325
- Hey. - Why are you coming close?

1694
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:39,895
I'm not the spy. Don't you remember the pact?

1695
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,225
(He acts suspicious.)

1696
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:43,155
- I know. - I won't rip your tag.

1697
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:45,155
Why are you doing this?

1698
01:07:45,325 --> 01:07:47,195
- Why? - Get him.

1699
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:49,725
- Get him. - Why are you doing this to me?

1700
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,155
Get him quickly.

1701
01:07:51,895 --> 01:07:56,025
(Will Seok Jin clear up the misunderstanding?)

1702
01:07:56,095 --> 01:07:59,325
You are the spy!

1703
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:01,355
(Seok Jin attacks.)

1704
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:02,625
- What is it? - I'm not the spy.

1705
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:03,725
(Everyone thinks he's the spy for sure.)

1706
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:05,625
No. I'm not the spy.

1707
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:07,295
He's the spy!

1708
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:10,055
(He brings the attention to himself.)

1709
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:12,995
He tried to rip my name tag.

1710
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,155
- Really? - Yes.

1711
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:16,725
- What is it? - They're trying to get me.

1712
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:18,525
(Here's the real spy.)

1713
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:20,525
Are you the spy?

1714
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,825
I'm not.

1715
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,095
Be careful.

1716
01:08:25,155 --> 01:08:26,225
I'm not the spy.

1717
01:08:26,295 --> 01:08:28,725
(I like to rip tags, but I'm not the spy.)

1718
01:08:28,795 --> 01:08:29,825
- Ji Sung. - Yes?

1719
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:32,095
- Hey. - You could be the spy.

1720
01:08:32,155 --> 01:08:33,825
- Wait. - Anyone here can be the spy.

1721
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:36,195
- All four can be spies. - I think...

1722
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:38,225
- we could all be spies. - Right.

1723
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,355
- Yes. - We could all be spies.

1724
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:43,625
- Hey. - Be careful.

1725
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:46,055
- We could all be spies. - That's right.

1726
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:49,025
- Yes. - So Yun and I will have a match.

1727
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:50,825
- Everyone, stay still. - Okay.

1728
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:52,895
- Okay. Fine. - What do you think?

1729
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,195
(Jae Seok will be at a disadvantage.)

1730
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:55,795
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, my.

1731
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:57,925
Don't you think it isn't fair?

1732
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:59,525
- I'll use only one hand. - Let's go our separate ways.

1733
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:01,355
- One hand. - Let's get separated.

1734
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:02,525
(Jae Seok pretends to want peace.)

1735
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,325
Let's get separated.

1736
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,325
Let's not do one-on-one.

1737
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:08,795
I understand how you feel.

1738
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,325
(Seok Jin is saved by Jae Seok.)

1739
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:11,525
- Gosh. - Let's get separated.

1740
01:09:13,825 --> 01:09:14,925
Who is it?

1741
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:16,525
Am I Agent J? Who's Agent J?

1742
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,265
(Am I Agent J? Who's Agent J?)

1743
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:19,325
(Jae Seok needs to use Seok Jin.)

1744
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:20,425
Oh, gosh.

1745
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,155
What does the spy do?

1746
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,125
We should have...

1747
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:30,625
(He can't understand why everyone agreed to separate.)

1748
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:33,695
We should've done the one-on-one match...

1749
01:09:33,725 --> 01:09:35,265
to get the spy.

1750
01:09:37,325 --> 01:09:38,625
If I rip Seok Jin's tag, people will suspect me.

1751
01:09:38,695 --> 01:09:39,725
(If I rip Seok Jin's tag, people will suspect me.)

1752
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:42,425
Who is that?

1753
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:43,825
It's Ji Hyo.

1754
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,125
Ji Hyo.

1755
01:09:45,195 --> 01:09:46,925
(Jae Seok spots Ji Hyo all alone.)

1756
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:48,025
Who is Agent J?

1757
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:49,825
Is it me or Ji Sung?

1758
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,625
(Is it me or Ji Sung?)

1759
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:53,425
Are you trying to rip my name tag?

1760
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:55,125
(Are you trying to rip my name tag?)

1761
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,625
How did you know?

1762
01:09:59,225 --> 01:10:00,325
Did you get Kwang Soo?

1763
01:10:01,025 --> 01:10:03,325
- I did. - What?

1764
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:04,995
(That's scary.)

1765
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,895
- Did you get Tae Se? - Yes.

1766
01:10:08,325 --> 01:10:11,355
- Both of you are spies. - Correct.

1767
01:10:11,425 --> 01:10:12,525
(Seok Jin joins in.)

1768
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,425
(They attack Ji Hyo.)

1769
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:21,795
(Agent J, let's win.)

1770
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:23,625
(They rip the name tag.)

1771
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,425
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1772
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:28,325
- I'm sorry. - Both of you.

1773
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,425
- But we are not spies. - We aren't.

1774
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:33,155
- We aren't spies. - We are just cornered.

1775
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:36,265
- We don't know how it'll end. - Really.

1776
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:37,925
- We might get attacked. - I'm sorry.

1777
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,265
- This is why we got you. - Right.

1778
01:10:39,325 --> 01:10:40,525
Ji Hyo, you should go.

1779
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,325
You'll understand when you watch the show.

1780
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:44,325
I'm sorry.

1781
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:45,995
(Seok Jin will be shocked when he watches the show.)

1782
01:10:48,525 --> 01:10:49,625
- We had no choice. - We need to end it.

1783
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:51,525
- We have to. - Let's end it.

1784
01:10:51,895 --> 01:10:53,725
I don't know who Agent J is.

1785
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,325
So Yun's coming. Let's get her.

1786
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:56,995
Okay. Wait.

1787
01:10:57,995 --> 01:11:01,025
(Are they spies or not?)

1788
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:02,825
(She's confused.)

1789
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:05,155
Are you really not the spy?

1790
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,325
All of you are such good actors.

1791
01:11:08,425 --> 01:11:10,195
- I... - You are...

1792
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:12,125
- You are not a spy, are you? - No.

1793
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:15,155
You are trying to bring me over here...

1794
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:16,725
- to rip my name tag. - No.

1795
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:19,995
Aren't you the one following me over here?

1796
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,025
No.

1797
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,225
Are you here to get me?

1798
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,025
No, how could I...

1799
01:11:26,725 --> 01:11:27,725
Are you the spy?

1800
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,265
- You are, aren't you? - That's right.

1801
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,825
- I'm the spy. - What?

1802
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:34,125
(That's right.)

1803
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:36,525
- I'm the spy. - What?

1804
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,725
(What?)

1805
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:41,895
You keep saying I'm the spy.

1806
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:43,095
I'm the spy.

1807
01:11:43,725 --> 01:11:44,825
Rip my name tag.

1808
01:11:45,895 --> 01:11:47,625
If I'm Agent J, you'll have to take all the blame.

1809
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:50,125
- Rip my name tag. - Well,

1810
01:11:50,195 --> 01:11:51,225
don't come near me.

1811
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,425
What will we do? The game won't end.

1812
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,425
I'm not sure if I'm Agent J...

1813
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:57,825
or not.

1814
01:11:58,525 --> 01:12:00,895
The spy knows his identity, though.

1815
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:02,095
He does. But I'm not the spy,

1816
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,155
so I'm telling you to rip my tag off.

1817
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:07,625
But if I turn out to be Agent J,

1818
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,595
everyone will blame you.

1819
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:10,725
I can't let that happen.

1820
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:11,855
I know. What are we supposed to do?

1821
01:12:13,555 --> 01:12:14,765
I am so confused right now.

1822
01:12:14,855 --> 01:12:17,055
I know.

1823
01:12:17,155 --> 01:12:18,855
Are you suspecting me or not?

1824
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:20,855
- I... - You should join me.

1825
01:12:22,265 --> 01:12:24,765
If you are not the spy, I will go with you.

1826
01:12:24,955 --> 01:12:26,325
Let's go.

1827
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,655
You are not trying to rip my name tag, are you?

1828
01:12:27,725 --> 01:12:28,765
No, I am not.

1829
01:12:29,495 --> 01:12:31,655
(So Yun gets persuaded by Jae Seok and hops on the train.)

1830
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:32,855
There they are.

1831
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,155
(So Yun gets persuaded by Jae Seok and hops on the train.)

1832
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,125
But I need one more cent to get this interpreted.

1833
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:37,855
(He needs one more cent.)

1834
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:39,495
- I... - You should bargain.

1835
01:12:39,595 --> 01:12:40,595
- They give a discount? - Yes.

1836
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,155
- Really? - Ji Hyo got a discount earlier.

1837
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:43,765
Talk to them nicely.

1838
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:44,855
(Jae Seok fools her by talking about the coin.)

1839
01:12:44,855 --> 01:12:48,425
(What's Jae Seok's scheme?)

1840
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:51,855
Don't give her everything.

1841
01:12:51,855 --> 01:12:53,265
(He gives her all the coins.)

1842
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:54,555
- You can't give her everything. - What do I do?

1843
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:59,765
(I got you!)

1844
01:13:01,455 --> 01:13:05,265
(While So Yun bargains, he rips her name tag.)

1845
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:06,855
(He succeeds.)

1846
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:09,855
(So Yun is out.)

1847
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:11,555
I knew it.

1848
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:13,225
Thank you.

1849
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:14,355
So Yun.

1850
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,555
I died.

1851
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:18,955
- I... - Come here, So Yun.

1852
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,265
- I had no choice. - You are unbelievable.

1853
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,495
I had no choice.

1854
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,955
I am sorry.

1855
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:25,225
I'm sorry, So Yun.

1856
01:13:25,265 --> 01:13:26,695
- I knew it. - I'm sorry.

1857
01:13:27,055 --> 01:13:28,695
- I... - I am sorry,

1858
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:29,765
- It's okay. - So Yun.

1859
01:13:29,765 --> 01:13:30,855
Go to the prison.

1860
01:13:31,265 --> 01:13:32,525
- You don't have to do this. - I will see you later.

1861
01:13:32,595 --> 01:13:33,725
See you later, So Yun.

1862
01:13:33,855 --> 01:13:35,355
See you later.

1863
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:37,225
(So Yun is betrayed by Jae Seok and is eliminated.)

1864
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:39,265
I'll see you later. I am sorry. I'm sorry, So Yun.

1865
01:13:39,325 --> 01:13:40,855
- Cheers, Jae Seok. - Cheers.

1866
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:45,855
(Who will be his next target?)

1867
01:13:47,495 --> 01:13:50,355
So it's either me or Jae Seok.

1868
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:53,725
Right. Agent J is one of you two.

1869
01:13:53,765 --> 01:13:54,955
(Ji Sung tries to form an alliance with Gary.)

1870
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,855
I am not the spy.

1871
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:57,955
Who is the spy then?

1872
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:00,695
It could be anyone among the six of us.

1873
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:01,955
Right.

1874
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:03,855
It's either Jae Seok or me.

1875
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,955
- But don't suspect me. - But look.

1876
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:10,055
Seok Jin told me not to suspect him, and you told me the same thing.

1877
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:12,055
- But now... - This is driving me mad.

1878
01:14:12,265 --> 01:14:14,155
- It's Ji Sung. - What?

1879
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:15,765
You can eliminate me.

1880
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:17,855
But I'm saying Ji Sung is the spy.

1881
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:19,425
I am not the spy.

1882
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:21,425
He is the spy.

1883
01:14:21,855 --> 01:14:23,055
- I am not the spy. - I was with Jae Seok...

1884
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,955
- I can give him my back... - all day long.

1885
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:27,855
- because I am not the spy. - I know Jae Seok well.

1886
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:30,355
I am not worried about my back.

1887
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:31,455
Can you do the same?

1888
01:14:31,455 --> 01:14:32,495
(Can Seok Jin show his back?)

1889
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:34,265
I can, but I am afraid you will rip my name tag.

1890
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:36,265
I just think...

1891
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,555
Seok Jin might not be the spy.

1892
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,765
I am not the spy.

1893
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:42,155
But it's right to eliminate us one by one.

1894
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:43,355
Right.

1895
01:14:43,555 --> 01:14:46,265
Someone has to eliminate people.

1896
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:52,265
(Seok Jin attacks.)

1897
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,855
(What?)

1898
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:59,955
(Seok Jin attacks Gary fast.)

1899
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:01,595
(He rips Gary's name tag.)

1900
01:15:02,155 --> 01:15:03,265
- I... - Why did you rip my tag?

1901
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:04,425
I ripped it because...

1902
01:15:04,955 --> 01:15:06,525
(Is Seok Jin the spy?)

1903
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:08,595
I was afraid that you'd attack first.

1904
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:10,155
Why did you eliminate me?

1905
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:12,155
- But I am not the spy. - Why did you eliminate me?

1906
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:14,455
You are neither the spy nor Agent J.

1907
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:16,155
- Why did you eliminate Gary? - I am not the spy. What?

1908
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:17,325
- Why did you do that? - What?

1909
01:15:17,455 --> 01:15:19,595
Why did you rip my name tag?

1910
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,325
Because he's not Agent J.

1911
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:22,955
- Why rip mine? - That's why I ripped his tag.

1912
01:15:22,955 --> 01:15:24,265
He's neither Agent J...

1913
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:26,055
- nor the spy! - Why would you rip my tag?

1914
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,765
I am sorry, Gary.

1915
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:29,355
- Grab him, Ji Sung. - Okay.

1916
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:34,555
(Will Seok Jin get eliminated like this?)

1917
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:35,725
Rip his tag.

1918
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,525
(But if Seok Jin turns out to be Agent J,)

1919
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:38,625
Hurry up.

1920
01:15:38,695 --> 01:15:40,225
(But if Seok Jin turns out to be Agent J,)

1921
01:15:40,265 --> 01:15:45,265
(the Secret Society's mission could fail.)

1922
01:15:49,055 --> 01:15:50,595
(He rips Haha's tag.)

1923
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:51,855
I ripped it first.

1924
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:54,455
(Haha is out.)

1925
01:15:54,525 --> 01:15:56,765
I'm not the spy.

1926
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:57,955
(With an incredible speed, he eliminates Haha.)

1927
01:15:58,765 --> 01:16:01,125
- Hey, I'm not the spy. - What just happened?

1928
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:02,695
I got my tag ripped too, Gary.

1929
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,765
Gosh.

1930
01:16:05,655 --> 01:16:07,265
- I don't care if mine gets ripped. - Okay.

1931
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:08,695
- I don't care if mine gets ripped. - Okay.

1932
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:09,955
But you are the spy.

1933
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,855
I'm telling you that I am not the spy.

1934
01:16:11,955 --> 01:16:13,155
(Now only the spy, Jae Seok,)

1935
01:16:13,225 --> 01:16:19,265
(and the two Agent J candidates, Ji Sung and Seok Jin remain.)

1936
01:16:20,855 --> 01:16:22,655
Jong Kook, when did you get eliminated?

1937
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:24,225
Both of you are eliminated?

1938
01:16:24,355 --> 01:16:25,455
Who ripped your tag?

1939
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:27,055
Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

1940
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:29,555
Jae Seok and Seok Jin are the spies.

1941
01:16:29,955 --> 01:16:32,595
Jae Seok is the spy for sure.

1942
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:34,765
- What's up with Seok Jin? - He's not the spy.

1943
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:36,765
Then why did Seok Jin eliminate me?

1944
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:38,625
I'm tired.

1945
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,125
(It's tiring to think about it.)

1946
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:44,355
(He drinks the red ginseng extract.)

1947
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:45,495
Drink it.

1948
01:16:45,495 --> 01:16:47,655
They kept sticking together.

1949
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:49,455
- That's strange. - It's strange.

1950
01:16:49,525 --> 01:16:50,525
(The victims recover their health.)

1951
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:53,955
- Right? - I hope Seok Jin is the spy.

1952
01:16:54,055 --> 01:16:57,355
- I hope he's the spy. - I hope he's the spy.

1953
01:16:57,455 --> 01:16:58,455
(Or he would look too stupid.)

1954
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:00,855
(This man is hopeless.)

1955
01:17:01,725 --> 01:17:02,765
- What's going on? - Who's Agent J?

1956
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:06,725
Seok Jin ripped Gary's and Haha's name tags.

1957
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:08,355
Haha? Why?

1958
01:17:08,425 --> 01:17:10,355
I didn't do anything!

1959
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:12,055
I just ripped their tags because they kept threatening me.

1960
01:17:12,155 --> 01:17:13,425
- You eliminated both of them? - Yes.

1961
01:17:13,955 --> 01:17:15,155
He eliminated both.

1962
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:17,055
- Team Yu! - No!

1963
01:17:17,855 --> 01:17:19,325
- Yu! - Team Yu Jee!

1964
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,655
- Cross! - Cross!

1965
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:21,955
(They are together again.)

1966
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,355
- What are you doing? - We formed...

1967
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:25,355
an alliance a while ago, but he's suspecting me too.

1968
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:26,655
Wait, aren't you the spy?

1969
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,855
- I am not the spy. - Then why did you rip the tags?

1970
01:17:29,355 --> 01:17:31,125
- I just did. - Why would you do that?

1971
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:32,725
They were attacking me.

1972
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:33,855
Is it you?

1973
01:17:33,855 --> 01:17:34,955
I told you. I am not the spy.

1974
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:37,955
I am not the spy.

1975
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,225
That means he's the spy.

1976
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:43,055
You could be the spy too.

1977
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:46,055
I telling you with my right arm on my chest.

1978
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:47,855
I can do that too.

1979
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,055
I could easily do that too.

1980
01:17:49,155 --> 01:17:50,355
It's not me.

1981
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:51,495
- Anyone can put a hand. - I just eliminated them...

1982
01:17:51,555 --> 01:17:53,855
because they were threatening me.

1983
01:17:53,855 --> 01:17:55,055
(It's a triangle of chaos.)

1984
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,765
- Why did you rip them? - I ripped three name tags.

1985
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:58,055
Why did you rip three name tags?

1986
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:01,225
They were threatening me even though I'm not the spy.

1987
01:18:01,495 --> 01:18:04,265
So you eliminated the rest of them?

1988
01:18:04,495 --> 01:18:05,765
- Who eliminated them? - I didn't eliminate anyone.

1989
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:06,855
Then...

1990
01:18:06,955 --> 01:18:07,955
- who eliminated them? - I...

1991
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,055
- How would I know? - Who eliminated So Yun?

1992
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,125
(Jae Seok tries to find out who is Agent J.)

1993
01:18:12,765 --> 01:18:13,955
I saw Seok Jin...

1994
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,625
ripping the name tags of Gary and Haha.

1995
01:18:15,955 --> 01:18:16,955
Honestly,

1996
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:18,055
(All right then.)

1997
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,555
I saw him ripping Tae Se's name tag.

1998
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:21,265
- You did? - Yes.

1999
01:18:22,225 --> 01:18:23,325
Are you really doing this to me?

2000
01:18:24,555 --> 01:18:25,695
He...

2001
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:27,955
He ripped Kwang Soo's name tag.

2002
01:18:28,055 --> 01:18:29,055
(Seok Jin tells on Jae Seok.)

2003
01:18:29,155 --> 01:18:30,525
(Oh, my gosh.)

2004
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:31,855
Are you really doing this to me?

2005
01:18:32,595 --> 01:18:33,765
You did it first.

2006
01:18:33,955 --> 01:18:36,765
So now, one of you is the spy.

2007
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:38,355
We don't know that.

2008
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:39,725
- Where is Jong Kook? - We did it to survive.

2009
01:18:39,765 --> 01:18:40,955
Where did Jong Kook go?

2010
01:18:41,225 --> 01:18:42,265
This...

2011
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:43,355
Did you eliminate Jong Kook's tag?

2012
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,765
(Many people seem to be missing.)

2013
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:46,055
- I didn't eliminate him. - Did you eliminate him?

2014
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,555
I didn't eliminate anyone.

2015
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,055
- Did you eliminate So Yun? - No, I didn't.

2016
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,155
Did you eliminate So Yun?

2017
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:52,355
I didn't eliminate So Yun.

2018
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:54,495
- You ripped Kwang Soo's. - I did.

2019
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:55,765
Why did you rip Kwang Soo's tag?

2020
01:18:55,855 --> 01:18:57,355
Kwang Soo, Gary and Haha...

2021
01:18:57,455 --> 01:18:59,325
- kept doubting us. - Yes.

2022
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:00,625
- But... - That's why we ripped the tags.

2023
01:19:00,855 --> 01:19:02,525
Agent J has no reason to rip the name tag.

2024
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:04,155
I don't know. I just eliminated them because they threatened me.

2025
01:19:04,955 --> 01:19:06,155
He had to survive.

2026
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,625
- I had to survive, you know? - He didn't want to go to prison...

2027
01:19:08,955 --> 01:19:12,155
and sit there with no purpose. Rather than going to the prison...

2028
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:13,695
- Yes. - He would help the spy.

2029
01:19:14,495 --> 01:19:16,725
(He would help the spy.)

2030
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:22,765
(What? What did you just say?)

2031
01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:24,225
(I didn't mean to say that.)

2032
01:19:24,265 --> 01:19:25,695
What did you do all day, Ji Sung?

2033
01:19:25,765 --> 01:19:27,455
(He changes the subject abruptly.)

2034
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:29,265
You can't lie with those eyes.

2035
01:19:29,355 --> 01:19:30,455
(You are suspicious, Ji Sung.)

2036
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:31,765
You think I'm a good actor?

2037
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:32,955
You act pretty well.

2038
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:35,765
Let's draw a conclusion.

2039
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:36,855
Yes. Let's do that.

2040
01:19:37,455 --> 01:19:38,625
What do we do?

2041
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:41,355
I really want to rip your name tag.

2042
01:19:41,765 --> 01:19:44,595
- You want to rip my tag? - I want to go with Jae Seok.

2043
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:46,355
Then you will be helping the spy.

2044
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:47,625
(Thank you so much, Seok Jin.)

2045
01:19:47,765 --> 01:19:49,125
No. He's Agent J.

2046
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:50,555
I believe he's Agent J.

2047
01:19:50,795 --> 01:19:52,425
But I am not the spy.

2048
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:53,765
Then should we rip his name tag?

2049
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:54,765
(Easily persuaded)

2050
01:19:54,765 --> 01:19:56,225
What?

2051
01:19:56,265 --> 01:19:57,425
We are Team Yu Jee.

2052
01:19:57,595 --> 01:19:59,225
- Yu. - Jee.

2053
01:19:59,265 --> 01:20:00,455
- Cross! - Cross!

2054
01:20:01,695 --> 01:20:03,055
I think this is wrong.

2055
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:06,155
- This is wrong. - I am so confused.

2056
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,525
(He needs to hurry up.)

2057
01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:11,055
(Who is Agent J?)

2058
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:13,155
(Is it Ji Sung?)

2059
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,765
(Is it Seok Jin?)

2060
01:20:16,265 --> 01:20:18,855
(He just has to rip Agent J's name tag.)

2061
01:20:18,955 --> 01:20:20,355
- I am not the spy. - I am so confused.

2062
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:22,225
- I am confused. - Or should I rip yours?

2063
01:20:22,265 --> 01:20:23,555
(Jae Seok changes the target.)

2064
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:25,155
- Me? - Yes.

2065
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:26,355
Then you two...

2066
01:20:26,425 --> 01:20:28,225
(Why are you targeting me?)

2067
01:20:28,265 --> 01:20:30,355
Look. I never said I should rip your tag.

2068
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:31,765
That sounds right.

2069
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,265
(Seok Jin goes closer to Ji Sung.)

2070
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,725
Wait.

2071
01:20:34,765 --> 01:20:35,855
That's not it.

2072
01:20:35,855 --> 01:20:37,955
- That's not it. - It ends when he rips the tag.

2073
01:20:38,055 --> 01:20:39,125
- It's the end. - Right?

2074
01:20:39,155 --> 01:20:40,555
That's not it.

2075
01:20:40,955 --> 01:20:43,425
Think carefully. That's not it.

2076
01:20:43,655 --> 01:20:44,955
Then why did you say you will rip my name tag?

2077
01:20:45,055 --> 01:20:47,765
I just said it to end the situation.

2078
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:49,725
(He laughs.)

2079
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:50,955
You've been acting suspicious.

2080
01:20:51,495 --> 01:20:52,725
- You've been acting suspicious. - Hey!

2081
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,225
- You are... - You said you trusted me.

2082
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:56,955
Yu!

2083
01:20:58,355 --> 01:20:59,595
Hey!

2084
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:02,125
You are suspicious.

2085
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:05,655
He's such a nice guy. He can't act.

2086
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:07,125
- I can't act. - How about me?

2087
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:09,265
- You are an actor. - I'm...

2088
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:11,225
- I'm an actor? - Let me ask questions.

2089
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:12,765
- Did you rip Jong Kook's tag? - No.

2090
01:21:13,225 --> 01:21:15,055
- Did you rip So Yun's tag? - No, I didn't rip anyone's tag.

2091
01:21:15,155 --> 01:21:16,325
(Ji Sung is innocent.)

2092
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:20,055
(Gosh, I'm not good at lying.)

2093
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:21,625
- Did you rip Jong Kook's tag? - Yes.

2094
01:21:21,695 --> 01:21:22,955
(Yes.)

2095
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:25,155
- Did you rip So Yun's tag? - Yes.

2096
01:21:25,265 --> 01:21:26,265
Come here.

2097
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:28,155
(I got you!)

2098
01:21:28,265 --> 01:21:29,495
Wait!

2099
01:21:29,587 --> 01:21:33,017
(Jae Seok goes for Agent J's name tag.)

2100
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:51,252
- Did you rip Jong Kook's tag? - Yes.

2101
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:52,582
(Yes.)

2102
01:21:53,582 --> 01:21:54,782
- Did you rip So Yun's tag? - Yes.

2103
01:21:54,892 --> 01:21:55,892
Come here.

2104
01:21:56,392 --> 01:21:57,782
(I got you!)

2105
01:21:57,892 --> 01:21:59,122
Wait!

2106
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:02,644
(Jae Seok goes for Agent J's name tag.)

2107
01:22:02,914 --> 01:22:04,044
Come here.

2108
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:06,254
(Will Agent J get eliminated first?)

2109
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,754
(Or will Jae Seok be eliminated first?)

2110
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,344
(Ripping)

2111
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:14,984
He's the spy!

2112
01:22:15,044 --> 01:22:16,754
(Jae Seok is out.)

2113
01:22:16,814 --> 01:22:17,844
My goodness.

2114
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:18,944
He's the spy!

2115
01:22:19,044 --> 01:22:21,144
(They manage to eliminate the spy.)

2116
01:22:21,214 --> 01:22:23,684
- What did I say? - Wow.

2117
01:22:23,754 --> 01:22:25,614
Jae Seok is the real spy.

2118
01:22:25,684 --> 01:22:27,344
- Are you really? - That was so close.

2119
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,344
(He almost had it.)

2120
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,644
- Really? Are you really the spy? - Gosh.

2121
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:33,544
- I almost had it. - Was it really you?

2122
01:22:33,944 --> 01:22:36,044
Gosh, that was so close.

2123
01:22:36,644 --> 01:22:39,644
(The Secret Society is victorious at the end.)

2124
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:41,584
I was so close.

2125
01:22:42,144 --> 01:22:43,344
Seriously?

2126
01:22:44,754 --> 01:22:46,044
Yes!

2127
01:22:46,214 --> 01:22:48,214
For goodness' sake.

2128
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:51,644
Is it time for me to retire as a gangster?

2129
01:22:51,644 --> 01:22:52,754
(Is it time for me to retire as a gangster?)

2130
01:22:52,754 --> 01:22:54,444
- How could you use me like that? - I...

2131
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:55,844
- How could you? - I was after...

2132
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:58,444
the reward money,

2133
01:22:59,044 --> 01:23:01,514
but you should use it for your country's independence.

2134
01:23:01,814 --> 01:23:03,644
- All right? - The funds will be used...

2135
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:05,344
for a great cause.

2136
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,514
Okay.

2137
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:11,844
Please use the funds for Korea's independence.

2138
01:23:11,944 --> 01:23:13,544
- You took out Jong Kook. - Bye...

2139
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:14,614
for now.

2140
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:16,044
(Bye for now.)

2141
01:23:16,044 --> 01:23:19,144
Passion and romance

2142
01:23:19,514 --> 01:23:22,414
Are like blowing wind

2143
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:24,844
(The spy makes his exit.)

2144
01:23:27,814 --> 01:23:31,044
(Provisional Government in Shanghai)

2145
01:23:32,544 --> 01:23:35,144
A message was sent from the Headquarters.

2146
01:23:35,214 --> 01:23:37,514
(A message from the Headquarters)

2147
01:23:40,544 --> 01:23:42,444
Dear Mr Go, director of Shanghai Headquarters,

2148
01:23:42,844 --> 01:23:45,144
attached is a portrait of Agent J.

2149
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:49,044
Please supervise his safe return.

2150
01:23:49,844 --> 01:23:51,214
Agent J's name is...

2151
01:23:52,754 --> 01:23:54,814
Park Ji Sung.

2152
01:23:54,844 --> 01:23:58,254
(Agent J is Park Ji Sung.)

2153
01:23:58,314 --> 01:23:59,944
Please protect the man...

2154
01:24:00,144 --> 01:24:03,614
who will become the hero of our people.

2155
01:24:03,684 --> 01:24:04,844
(Captain Park was Agent J!)

2156
01:24:04,944 --> 01:24:07,044
Agent J, we did it.

2157
01:24:07,144 --> 01:24:08,314
We did it together.

2158
01:24:08,514 --> 01:24:10,444
I'm really sorry for...

2159
01:24:10,514 --> 01:24:12,254
- doubting you. - Don't worry about it.

2160
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:14,414
I didn't think I'd be standing here.

2161
01:24:14,444 --> 01:24:15,844
Please don't cry on your way back.

2162
01:24:15,944 --> 01:24:17,754
All there is left to do is to make our way to Manchuria.

2163
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:19,214
- Excellent! - Great.

2164
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:25,344
(Laughing)

2165
01:24:25,814 --> 01:24:27,754
Code name, Agent J.

2166
01:24:28,714 --> 01:24:31,844
Let's put this money to good use.

2167
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:33,944
Let's go, Agent J!

2168
01:24:37,144 --> 01:24:39,044
(The Secret Society accomplished their mission.)

2169
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:41,544
I'm sorry for doubting you.

2170
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:44,714
I thought you were the spy until the end.

2171
01:24:45,684 --> 01:24:46,684
Good job.

2172
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:48,784
This is the end.

2173
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,684
We have done it.

2174
01:24:51,344 --> 01:24:52,444
Well done.

2175
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:59,944
(Agent J was the leader who was protected by everyone.)

2176
01:25:00,044 --> 01:25:04,844
The persistence of the Secret Society...

2177
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:08,944
paid off as it contributed to the country's independence.

2178
01:25:11,784 --> 01:25:13,344
(A round of applause for today's winners)

2179
01:25:13,414 --> 01:25:16,814
We sent the military funds to where it was most needed.

2180
01:25:16,844 --> 01:25:18,254
Why are you here?

2181
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,714
Why did you eliminate me if you were not the spy?

2182
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:21,844
Why did you do that?

2183
01:25:21,944 --> 01:25:22,944
My goodness.

2184
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:25,754
That's why we always eliminate him first.

2185
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:27,314
Gary asked if we should take out...

2186
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:28,844
- Seok Jin in the beginning. - Yes, right.

2187
01:25:28,944 --> 01:25:30,844
I should have listened to him.

2188
01:25:30,944 --> 01:25:31,944
I was worried he would text me...

2189
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:34,814
saying "Why did you take me out?"

2190
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:35,589
I'm sorry,

2191
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,796
but you'll be the first one I'll eliminate next week.

2192
01:25:38,796 --> 01:25:40,586
- I agree. - You need to understand.

2193
01:25:40,586 --> 01:25:42,086
Please understand.

2194
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:43,356
- I have no choice. - Let me have the honour.

2195
01:25:43,386 --> 01:25:45,586
I would rip your name tag even if you're on my team.

2196
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,200
The two of them successfully completed the mission.

2197
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,200
- Congratulations. - What a relief.

2198
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,600
They're the winners.

2199
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,570
We are all winners.

2200
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,300
So Yun and Tae Se, say a few words.

2201
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,600
I feel so bad for Tae Se.

2202
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,500
Why did you rip my name tag so early in the game?

2203
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,870
Couldn't you be a little more lenient?

2204
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,840
- Well... - You should have been.

2205
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,970
I wanted to be part of the climax.

2206
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,300
He's learned a lot.

2207
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:10,040
Give me just one more chance.

2208
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,940
Then he'll eliminate us all.

2209
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,200
Just once more. It won't be the same next time.

2210
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:16,000
I had such a great time,

2211
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,940
and I was happy to be on the show with Ji Sung and Tae Se.

2212
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:23,200
I also had a great time with the Running Man cast.

2213
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:27,000
But Jae Seok did scare me when he ripped my name tag.

2214
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,200
(But Jae Seok did scare me when he ripped my name tag.)

2215
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,200
I'm happy to have joined the show with the two football players.

2216
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,410
You were glad.

2217
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,500
I was happy.

2218
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,500
I wish the best for Running Man.

2219
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:39,770
- He didn't repeat after me. - Thank you.

2220
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,300
Thank you.

2221
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,200
Thank you to the three football players...

2222
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,870
for sharing your time with us.

2223
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,100
Let's give them a round of applause.

2224
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,500
Thank you.

2225
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,840
(Thank you for sharing your time with us.)

2226
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,800
Someone is targeting your name tag...

2227
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:56,670
on your way to the studio.

2228
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:58,700
- Really? - We start now, right?

2229
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,740
Who's after my name tag?

2230
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:01,970
Oh, boy.

2231
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:03,500
You scared me.

2232
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,200
My goodness. What was that?

2233
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,000
I'm so nervous.

2234
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,300
I can't trust anybody.

2235
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,840
Not even the cameraman.

2236
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,770
What are you doing? Why are you doing this?

2237
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,300
No!

2238
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,940
(This is where they were headed to.)

2239
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,600
- This is the future. - What is this?

2240
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,410
Look at the scale of this place.

2241
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,800
(The state-of-the art Running Man Laboratory)

2242
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:24,000
(Using data from the last six years, we analysed members' skill levels.)

2243
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,370
(We test everything from the cast's fitness to endurance.)

2244
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,600
(Next week,)

2245
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:28,870
(we decide on a winner...)

2246
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,900
(who will leave a mark in Running Man's history.)

2247
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,300
Are you crying?

2248
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,100
(Tune in next week for the Fifth Official Skill Assessment.)
