00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,320
(What is this?)

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,420
Who?

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
I don't know.

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Who is after it?

15
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,230
(Who's after my name tag?)

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,690
Someone's after my name tag?

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Is it you?

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,420
You're after my name tag, right?

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
It's you, isn't it?

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,920
Is it attached properly?

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,260
Don't worry, I have it on me.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,220
(Someone is after your name tag.)

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,790
If it's until I enter the waiting room,

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,820
then has it begun already?

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,720
(The game starts now.)

26
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,820
(He looks behind.)

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,220
(He is suddenly frightened.)

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,320
(Who? Who's after my name tag?)

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,420
(Why? Now? Just me?)

30
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,020
Where's the waiting room?

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,520
Someone's going to ambush me?

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
Oh, my.

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,020
Really?

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,220
(Really?)

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,260
Wait. What about my hair?

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,320
I need to put some makeup on first.

37
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,790
Wait.

38
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,520
Am I targeted constantly?

39
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,920
(Am I targeted constantly?)

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,160
Then can I knock the person out?

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Is that all right?

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,990
I've been doing this for years.

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,890
Ripping my name tag off won't be so easy.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Today is going to be...

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
(He begins to workout all of a sudden.)

46
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
This will be fun.

47
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,420
Until I reach the waiting room? Where is the waiting room?

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
(All members have received the mission.)

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,160
(Test No. 1: Agility Test, The observation begins.)

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,520
(Kwang Soo is quick to betray.)

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,290
What's going on?

52
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,620
It's my first time coming here for makeup.

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,120
Someone's after me even in this moment?

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,620
(Kwang Soo is very anxious from the beginning.)

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,920
It's my first time ever coming here. Who would know I'm here?

56
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,520
(Kwang Soo is very anxious from the beginning.)

57
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,420
Who?

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
(Who?)

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,720
Is it you?

60
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,320
(Is it you?)

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,020
I won't put up with it today.

62
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,520
(I won't put up with it today.)

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,190
You're on my radar too.

64
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,920
(The cameraman is also on his list.)

65
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,120
(Or maybe there's a guest waiting upstairs.)

66
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,320
Starting now?

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,520
Hello. Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Hello.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,720
- Please take a seat. - Hello.

70
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,920
(It is his first time at this hair salon.)

71
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,020
- Isn't it cold outside? - Yes.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,990
(Most of the people here are complete strangers.)

73
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,320
(Thank goodness.)

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,420
(After I get my hair done fast...)

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
(and enter the waiting room...)

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,690
It's nice to meet you.

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
(What?)

78
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,620
Hold on!

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,020
(He was caught off guard.)

80
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,220
No, wait.

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,720
(Now this is what we call a test of agility.)

82
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,520
(The agent can go after the name tag for 10 seconds.)

83
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,520
Who are you?

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,690
(Who are you?)

85
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
(The 10 seconds is up.)

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I fended him off.

87
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
I blocked him.

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,930
(Kwang Soo is surprisingly agile.)

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,620
Excuse me. Who are you?

90
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,820
(Who are you?)

91
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,820
Do you work here?

92
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,190
(Yes)

93
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
- Do you really work here? - Yes.

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,720
(You're really good.)

95
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,020
I've been at this for six years.

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Oh, my.

98
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,320
He's a complete stranger.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
What's going on?

100
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,020
(Please sit here.)

101
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm sorry, but could you please stand over there?

102
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm very on edge today.

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,220
(He sinks down to protect his name tag.)

104
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Yes.

105
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
What?

106
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,020
(What is happening?)

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,320
What is this?

108
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,190
I think I was quite cool just now.

109
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,060
(Surprisingly agile. Potential is unknown but is simple-minded.)

110
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,120
(Seok Jin is full of confidence.)

111
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,990
I can't trust anyone.

112
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,320
(I can't trust anyone.)

113
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,620
Who are you?

114
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,220
Please go first.

115
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,320
Are you going down or up?

116
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,820
You're going up? Then it's fine.

117
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,260
(He needlessly yells at his neighbours.)

118
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,260
This is...

119
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,820
(He is startled.)

120
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,890
(Seok Jin is easily scared.)

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,920
(Gary has keen senses.)

122
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,290
Is there another person in this?

123
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,720
(Running)

124
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,920
You startled me.

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,990
(He was very startled.)

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,020
(Haha is great with tricks.)

127
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Excuse me.

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,520
You're not a spy, are you?

129
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,820
(You're not a spy, are you?)

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,420
What are you filming?

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
I have a weird feeling about this.

132
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,620
(If these people are actors, it's not safe here.)

133
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,690
Are you really a couple?

134
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,420
Are you?

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,820
Aren't you strangers?

136
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,060
No.

137
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Really? I am a bit on edge today.

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,420
If you're a real couple, could you hold hands?

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,820
Can you kiss her hand?

140
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,220
(He pecks her hand.)

141
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,690
- You're a great actor. - No, that's not true.

142
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,690
Aren't we a fine couple?

143
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,260
You are a great couple, but...

144
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,920
(Something's strange.)

145
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,520
There's something fishy going on.

146
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,390
Are you really the chef here?

147
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,090
- Are you? - Yes.

148
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,220
- Are you really sure? - Yes.

149
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,420
(He doubts everything.)

150
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,690
Excuse me,

151
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,220
how long have you worked here?

152
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
- I started just today. - You started today. I knew it.

153
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
It's strange, right?

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,420
You don't usually wear glasses, do you?

155
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Are you filming me with your glasses?

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,990
(Haha doubts everyone.)

157
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,820
I got goosebumps all over.

158
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm serious.

159
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,020
I'm scared.

160
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,220
The gym isn't usually this crowded in the morning.

161
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,290
There are so many people today.

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,020
(Who is brave enough to go after Jong Kook's name tag?)

163
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,420
(He is startled.)

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,190
Who is this person?

165
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,220
There's something fishy about him.

166
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
(There's something fishy about him.)

167
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Why are there...

168
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,820
so many...

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
suspicious people in the gym today?

170
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
This is strange.

171
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,290
(His radar is on.)

172
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,220
(Someone suddenly appears.)

173
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,460
Goodness.

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,620
What are you doing?

175
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Why are you doing this?

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
What is wrong with these people?

177
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,190
Why are you doing this?

178
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,420
Are you out of your minds?

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,820
(His personal trainer, stylist and manager)

180
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,120
What is this?

181
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,020
- What do you think you're doing? - Why?

182
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,990
What are you doing?

183
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,520
Are you out of your minds?

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,060
They must be...

185
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
out of their minds.

186
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,420
What are you doing?

187
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Are you after me, too?

188
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
(Are you after me, too?)

189
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,420
I'm in trouble.

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
The gym isn't safe.

191
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
(Jong Kook is strong and quick-witted.)

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,020
(Ji Hyo is lucky and is the ace of the team.)

193
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
This is really...

194
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,020
Why do you make me...

195
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,890
doubt everyone so early in the morning?

196
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Why?

197
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,420
I can't let anyone pass me by without suspecting them.

198
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Good morning.

199
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Please, go over there.

200
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,320
You don't need to say hello. Just go over there.

201
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,720
There's no need to say hello. Just go over there.

202
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,220
Hurry. Okay.

203
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,260
I'll find my seat on my own. Just go away.

204
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,020
(The hair salon feels more like a minefield today.)

205
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
What is that?

206
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,290
(The hair salon feels more like a minefield today.)

207
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,390
(She's surprised.)

208
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,460
(Flinching)

209
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,190
(She sits down on the chair.)

210
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,090
Hello. Hello.

211
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,990
You are getting your hair done early in the morning.

212
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,990
Okay. I am okay.

213
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,660
I already washed my hair.

214
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,990
Don't touch my body! Go away.

215
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,590
You can fix my hair like this, right?

216
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,690
No. Go away.

217
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,090
Get away!

218
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,090
No!

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,390
No. Just fix my hair like this.

220
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,090
It's all right.

221
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,260
(She starts fixing Ji Hyo's hair.)

222
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,190
What's your mission?

223
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,490
I can't get my name tag ripped until I get to the next destination.

224
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,990
(I can't get my name tag ripped until I reach the next destination.)

225
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,260
Can I rip it then?

226
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,990
Can I rip it then?

227
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,560
(What?)

228
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,190
You want to rip it?

229
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,890
- I will rip it at once. - Do you want to be done with me?

230
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,090
(Their friendship is at stake.)

231
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,030
(But her biggest enemy was even nearer.)

232
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,260
By the way,

233
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,390
I fall asleep when someone touches my hair. I'm in trouble.

234
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,990
- Let's make her fall asleep. - I'm in trouble.

235
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,290
- Let's make her fall asleep. - Gosh.

236
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,990
I sleep whenever I get my hair done.

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,590
But who here would target my name tag?

238
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,820
I am already sleepy.

239
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,990
(Ji Hyo reacts fast and falls asleep fast.)

240
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,890
(Jae Seok has small eyes, but he's very sharp.)

241
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,590
(Startled)

242
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,890
What was that?

243
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,820
Something's not right.

244
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,820
(Who is targeting my name tag?)

245
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,620
Who is targeting my name tag?

246
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,090
Oh gosh!

247
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,290
That surprised me.

248
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,660
Can we take a picture with you?

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,820
(Can we take a picture with you?)

250
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,190
- Can we take a picture with you? - Sure.

251
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,490
Go ahead.

252
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,260
Okay.

253
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,290
- Wait. - Wait.

254
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,390
(Flinching)

255
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,860
What's wrong?

256
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,820
Please get closer.

257
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,490
You are too far from her.

258
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,660
(Gosh, stay closer.)

259
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,990
Wait.

260
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,220
This is strange.

261
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,290
Wait. They are a little strange.

262
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,590
- It's... - One, two, three.

263
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,990
(Even if they are suspicious, he takes a picture with them.)

264
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,890
- Thank you. - It's fine.

265
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,490
- One more. - Okay.

266
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,760
- Wait. - Wait.

267
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,490
Why do you hold my hand?

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,990
Wait.

269
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,590
- Don't touch my hands. - Stay closer.

270
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,890
Don't touch me.

271
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,090
Okay.

272
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,590
(He stands awkwardly.)

273
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,190
I won't do it.

274
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,290
That's not it.

275
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,560
You keep trying to put your hand behind my back.

276
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,190
(Jae Seok guards himself even from fan girls.)

277
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,190
- Okay. Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

278
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,290
What are you doing?

279
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,690
- Should I get in? - Yes.

280
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,390
Yes.

281
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,920
(Wait)

282
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,890
(Who said you can leave?)

283
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,290
(Give me your name tag.)

284
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,490
Oh gosh!

285
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,820
(The fan girls return.)

286
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,090
Excuse me!

287
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,190
I knew it!

288
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,090
I thought you were strange.

289
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,090
What are you doing?

290
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,490
I thought you were acting strange.

291
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,220
- Wait. - What?

292
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,390
- There's a problem with the audio. - What?

293
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,820
What problem does it have?

294
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,790
- There's a problem. - What problem?

295
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,860
- The audio isn't working. - Why isn't it working?

296
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,590
(Did the mic fall when I was running?)

297
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,720
Why doesn't it work?

298
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,990
(He grabs Jae Seok's name tag.)

299
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,390
(Will he let it get ripped?)

300
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,990
Hey!

301
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,090
Hey!

302
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,560
(He got his name tag ripped!)

303
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,290
(The audio crew removes his name tag.)

304
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,820
(Jae Seok is out for the first time.)

305
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,390
Hey!

306
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,660
How can this happen?

307
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,790
You are out once.

308
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,690
How can he be allowed to do this? This is crazy.

309
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,390
So we don't know who it's going to be. The girls were acting strange.

310
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,890
Gosh.

311
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,290
I've never seen people like them in my neighbourhood.

312
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,990
(Even after getting it ripped off, he doesn't stop talking.)

313
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,490
Gosh.

314
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,490
It's cold.

315
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,090
(Gary is on his way to meet his manager.)

316
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,020
- Hello. - Hello.

317
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,390
(He meets strange fans too.)

318
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,190
- Wait. - No. No.

319
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,390
- Please take a picture with us. - No. No.

320
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,890
I don't take pictures.

321
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,190
- Please take one picture with us. - No. No pictures.

322
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,760
- Why not? - No.

323
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
I don't want to!

324
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,660
I can't take a picture.

325
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,920
- Please take a picture with me. - I look too ugly today.

326
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,490
But I look pretty today.

327
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,890
Then I will take a picture of you.

328
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,990
(His fans don't give up.)

329
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,560
- Gosh. - It looks nice!

330
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,760
No!

331
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,920
(The girl tries to grab it.)

332
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,620
No!

333
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,090
You were so close!

334
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,190
- Come inside the picture. - You didn't take it.

335
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,090
In 1, 2, 3.

336
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,760
(Gary is very quick and sharp.)

337
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,890
Okay. Okay.

338
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,660
- Cheers! - Cheers!

339
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
Cheers!

340
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,090
She reached out for my name tag so quickly.

341
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,890
(Gary finally meets his manager after the intense fan meeting.)

342
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,790
- You should get on from this side. - I will ride in the back?

343
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,720
(He reaches out for the name tag.)

344
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,590
(He grabs it.)

345
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,820
What are you doing?

346
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,720
(What's wrong with him?)

347
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,890
Goodness.

348
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,460
It's a good start.

349
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,090
So this is how it goes.

350
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,360
(Kwang Soo is surprisingly doing well.)

351
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,020
We don't know how many times we will be attacked, right?

352
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,090
- I'll change your mic battery. - Hold on.

353
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,290
Hold on.

354
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,890
- I can't hear your voice. - What?

355
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,360
- The mic... - I will give it to you.

356
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,890
- The mic... - I...

357
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,890
(He looks around.)

358
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,590
I will borrow this for a second.

359
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,490
You know what this is, right?

360
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,190
(He's surrounded by enemies.)

361
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,390
No one is on my side.

362
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,760
It's okay. Here.

363
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,990
(I think today will be a very tough day.)

364
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,760
It's my first time here, so I don't know who works here.

365
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,490
(He is not acquainted with the workers at the salon.)

366
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,090
- Do you need anything? - What?

367
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,460
Do you need anything?

368
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,260
- Do I need anything? - You want something to drink?

369
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,860
- What? - Anything to drink?

370
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,560
They all work here, right?

371
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,190
They all work here, right?

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,020
(Of course.)

373
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,490
I am sorry. It's just that it's my first time here.

374
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,890
(But what is up with this chilly atmosphere?)

375
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,720
Who works here?

376
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,860
(He's scared.)

377
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,290
(The girl stares at Kwang Soo.)

378
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,660
Do you need anything?

379
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,820
(Do you need anything?)

380
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,720
Please don't do that. It frightens me.

381
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,190
You're scaring me.

382
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,560
(But I need something from you.)

383
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,660
(He got his hair done in the hair-raising environment.)

384
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,990
No. It's okay.

385
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,090
- I'll help you take it out. - This is how I wear my clothes.

386
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,260
(No, I always wear my clothes like this.)

387
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,090
No, I'll do it myself.

388
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,890
No, I am okay.

389
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,190
Please.

390
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,860
You look so terrifying.

391
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,390
(Please, leave me alone.)

392
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,090
I will do it. What's going on?

393
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,590
What's going on? Wait.

394
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,990
Please, just leave me alone.

395
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,290
Please.

396
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,790
(He gets up.)

397
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,290
What? Okay.

398
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,790
(Flinching)

399
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,090
Please give up now.

400
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,690
Give up already.

401
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,660
(He moves fast.)

402
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,660
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

403
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,920
(He's about to escape.)

404
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,260
Give up already.

405
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,590
I'll get going. Thank you.

406
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,890
Bye.

407
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,090
(He manages to escape the hair salon.)

408
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,790
(However, Haha is still suspecting the couple.)

409
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,590
(He stares at them.)

410
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,390
How long have you been dating your boyfriend?

411
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,820
(He starts interrogating her.)

412
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,620
(He takes a seat and starts questioning her.)

413
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,960
How long have you been dating your boyfriend?

414
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,290
- I have a boyfriend. - So how long have you been dating?

415
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,890
- Three years. - Three years?

416
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,560
(He asked her how long they've been dating.)

417
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Where did you meet him?

418
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,490
At school.

419
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,660
When is your boyfriend's birthday?

420
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,790
- April 15th. - April 15th.

421
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,290
(He is very suspicious of them.)

422
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,790
Thank you. I am sorry.

423
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,960
(Someone touches Haha's name tag...)

424
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,290
(and rips it.)

425
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,860
(When he was suspecting the couple,)

426
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,190
(one of the crew memebers ripped his name tag.)

427
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,590
(How can this happen?)

428
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
What was that?

429
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,890
(He rips his name tag and leaves.)

430
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,260
(The suspicious Haha is out for the first time.)

431
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,820
This is crazy.

432
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,760
When you live in the world where you can trust no one,

433
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,390
your heart really shrinks.

434
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,490
(He doesn't stop talking.)

435
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,090
(Someone approaches him.)

436
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Hey!

437
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,190
Hey!

438
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,790
(He's shocked.)

439
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,290
Hey!

440
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,760
Yoo Seok.

441
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,960
You can't do this to me.

442
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,990
No way.

443
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,190
Hey! Hey! No way.

444
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,290
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

445
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,690
Are you really...

446
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,090
Are you really...

447
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,790
Hey!

448
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,090
(The cameraman attacks him.)

449
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,190
Yoo Seok,

450
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,490
you can't do this to me!

451
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,990
Hey!

452
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,190
(He rips the name tag.)

453
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,690
(Seok Jin is out for the first time.)

454
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,730
This is impossible. What is wrong with you?

455
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,820
Gosh!

456
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,820
Hey, how can you...

457
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,820
How can you be so cold-hearted?

458
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,590
I never thought you would do this to me.

459
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,990
No one can be trusted.

460
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Are you sure you are working for our company?

461
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,360
(He takes it out on his manager.)

462
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,820
- Please get in the car. - You get in first.

463
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,190
(I can't trust anybody.)

464
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,820
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is moving to the next destination.)

465
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,960
Gosh.

466
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,290
(Sneaky)

467
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,860
Hey! What are you doing?

468
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,390
What are you doing right now?

469
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,390
(Looking for every chance)

470
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,660
Gosh...

471
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,230
(Looking for every chance)

472
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,590
Are you allowed to do this?

473
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,090
Can you sit next to me and just rip my name tag?

474
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,290
By the way, where are we going?

475
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,730
(Where are they headed?)

476
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,990
We should get some coffee.

477
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,090
(Let's get some coffee.)

478
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,190
Coffee?

479
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,230
(Coffee?)

480
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,860
Why do you want coffee all of a sudden?

481
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,230
I won't let it slide. What do you mean, "Check the audio"?

482
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,890
Do you want to get checked by me?

483
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,790
Oh my goodness.

484
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,590
Is that a new store?

485
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,090
Come on.

486
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,690
(That was close.)

487
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,390
(They finally arrive at a cafe.)

488
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,590
Where do I need to go?

489
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,790
- That way. - Let go.

490
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,420
Let go. I almost hit you with my elbow.

491
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,360
- Is it here? - Yes.

492
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,590
Oh, come on.

493
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,690
Don't touch my back.

494
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,090
(I was just showing you the way.)

495
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,090
Is this it?

496
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,230
(Jae Seok arrives at the second destination.)

497
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,890
- Are you going to be like that? - Don't worry.

498
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,590
- Hello. - Hello.

499
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,260
- Hello. - Hello.

500
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,590
You don't look like regular customers.

501
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,620
There's something about you.

502
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,790
I can tell by your looks.

503
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
(The cameraman touches Jae Seok's back.)

504
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,590
Wait. Hey.

505
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,190
(Startled)

506
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,690
Stop it.

507
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,860
You'll pay for this.

508
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
(There are enemies everywhere.)

509
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,230
(Turning)

510
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,390
(Jae Seok is startled.)

511
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,260
- What is it? - Can we take a picture?

512
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,420
- Can we take a picture? - A picture?

513
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,230
Taking a picture is no problem.

514
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,260
I'll take the picture.

515
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,790
(I'll take it.)

516
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,190
(A girl creeps up.)

517
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,890
Wasn't someone just here?

518
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,590
Right?

519
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,230
Didn't someone just get close?

520
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,890
(Someone was near me.)

521
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,990
Am I wrong?

522
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
(Maybe I'm wrong.)

523
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,160
(Another lady stands up.)

524
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,390
You scared me!

525
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,860
You scared me!

526
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,760
(A girl grabs his name tag.)

527
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Gosh!

528
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,990
(She rips it off.)

529
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,690
Wait a minute.

530
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,990
(That was...)

531
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,260
(perfect teamwork.)

532
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,760
(Jae Seok's out for the second time.)

533
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,890
Is that valid?

534
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,190
This isn't fair.

535
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,890
Who are you? Why did you rip off my tag?

536
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,990
(After getting her makeup and and hair done,)

537
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,230
(Ji Hyo leaves the hair salon in suspicion.)

538
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,390
Please, do something about her.

539
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,790
(Please, do something about her.)

540
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,890
Watch the car.

541
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,490
Let's go.

542
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,060
You should protect me.

543
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,120
Trust me. I'm not...

544
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,230
- the bad guy. - Okay. All right.

545
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,490
You go first.

546
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,860
Manager.

547
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,290
Come this way.

548
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,560
(Manager, come this way.)

549
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,090
- Hello. - Hello.

550
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,590
(Hello)

551
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,390
(Ji Hyo's afraid someone might rip her name tag off.)

552
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
I'm embarrassed.

553
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,160
Why do I have to be...

554
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,190
suspicious of an innocent passerby?

555
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,260
Manager!

556
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,160
(Manager, please come quickly.)

557
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,260
Come here quickly. Now.

558
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,420
- Hey. - Yes!

559
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,390
(Ji Hyo is out for the first time.)

560
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,390
I knew you were going to do that.

561
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,290
I knew you would do that.

562
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,690
I shouldn't have trusted you.

563
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,990
(Ji Hyo may get violent under pressure.)

564
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,490
- Yes! - Oh my gosh.

565
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,590
Hey.

566
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,290
Wait.

567
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,490
Why are you doing this?

568
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,490
(He grabs the name tag.)

569
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,460
Why are you doing this?

570
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,790
Come on, guys.

571
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,890
Come on.

572
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,690
What's wrong with you?

573
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,220
Why are you doing this?

574
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,490
Come on.

575
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,990
(Jong Kook is out for the first time.)

576
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,290
Oh gosh.

577
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,990
Everyone here is after my name tag.

578
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,860
I have to work out, but I can't.

579
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,890
What do you want me to do?

580
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,590
He's my actual personal trainer.

581
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,690
(Someone as muscular as he must rip his name tag off.)

582
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,260
Oh gosh.

583
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,190
(The first attack in Agility Test is over.)

584
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,360
(Meanwhile at the cafe)

585
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,860
I can't even trust the cameraman.

586
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,490
- Hi, Gary. - Hi.

587
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,990
Come here. Did they get your name tag?

588
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,090
Theses people...

589
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,960
No, not yet.

590
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,190
- Really? - Hello.

591
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,390
Come here quickly.

592
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,490
(Gary takes a seat.)

593
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,690
Oh gosh.

594
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,060
(Oh gosh.)

595
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,390
What are you doing?

596
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,860
Oh my goodness.

597
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,890
- Let's not do this to each other. - Okay.

598
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,090
(I should've ripped it off.)

599
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,590
Can we take a picture?

600
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,290
I don't usually take pictures.

601
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,890
I only take it when I look handsome.

602
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,060
- You're handsome. - Today, my face is puffy.

603
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,890
- That's funny. - Oh gosh.

604
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,190
Even my manager tried to get me.

605
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,690
- Really? - Yes.

606
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,220
He tried to rip my name tag.

607
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,790
- That's too much. - Gosh.

608
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,990
- He almost got me. - Goodness.

609
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,090
(People are watching them.)

610
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,490
Gary, we need to check your audio.

611
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,760
That scared me.

612
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,390
(Gary doesn't think twice. He just turns his back.)

613
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,360
What?

614
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,490
(Gary's tag gets ripped off.)

615
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,090
Come on.

616
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,390
(Gary is upset.)

617
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,490
That's really mean.

618
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,460
- Gosh. - I can't believe it.

619
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,820
- This is too much. - Wow.

620
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,390
(Gary blames others for his carelessness.)

621
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,390
(Seok Jin arrives at the cafe.)

622
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,690
Even the bodyguards are scary today.

623
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,760
(He rushes to get inside.)

624
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,290
What's going on?

625
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,060
I can't feel anything.

626
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,260
You're here.

627
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,790
- Hi. - Hi, Gary.

628
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,990
(Seok Jin is very defensive.)

629
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,090
- Come here. - Be careful.

630
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,190
(Here comes...)

631
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,790
(the prey.)

632
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,990
One Americano and...

633
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,320
Do you have any snacks?

634
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,390
(He's very defensive.)

635
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,490
Can you make it quickly?

636
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,690
(Gary and Jae Seok...)

637
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,490
(are playing perfect defence.)

638
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,690
What are you doing?

639
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,860
(Seok Jin...)

640
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,260
(showed his back.)

641
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,590
These people...

642
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,990
(Gary rips the tag.)

643
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,060
(Oh gosh!)

644
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,390
(They are brutal.)

645
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,890
Once you have your drinks, you can move to the next place.

646
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,260
- Really? - I have to get my drink.

647
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,790
Why don't you attack Seok Jin? Just do it.

648
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,220
Is that mine?

649
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,290
(She reaches for the tag.)

650
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,990
(Gary rips it.)

651
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,860
(That was good...)

652
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,090
(teamwork.)

653
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,920
(This is the second time already.)

654
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,220
- Thank you. - Here.

655
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,490
- Here's your name tag you ordered. - Come on.

656
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,390
I can't remember how many times I got ripped.

657
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,790
(They all have their drinks.)

658
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,890
I'm so hungry.

659
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,890
- Seok Jin, let me check your audio. - My audio?

660
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,990
I need to check the battery.

661
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,920
(Of course.)

662
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,960
(The audio needs to be checked indeed.)

663
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,290
(Audio director is here.)

664
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,790
(He rips the tag off.)

665
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,890
(What?)

666
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,090
(Seok Jin needs to do better than this.)

667
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,590
(Seok Jin is destined to be the race starter.)

668
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,090
I will...

669
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,490
get going.

670
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,460
- I'll see you later. - See you later.

671
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,990
Always watch your back.

672
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,090
(Always watch your back.)

673
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,390
(Will Jae Seok escape first?)

674
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,190
(Seok Jin rips the tag off.)

675
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,020
(Did he just get my tag?)

676
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,390
I was just saying farewell.

677
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,990
- Come on. - That's brutal.

678
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,260
(Jae Seok is very agile but is easily distracted and careless.)

679
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,320
That's really bad.

680
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,990
(Ji Hyo's sleeping.)

681
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,590
(Someone's hand touches her.)

682
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,290
(She wakes up.)

683
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,990
(How dare you?)

684
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,860
(Ji Hyo is angry.)

685
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,990
Don't rip my tag.

686
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,260
(At the cafe)

687
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,860
Can we take a picture?

688
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,990
- Can we take a picture? - Okay. Give me your phone.

689
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,590
(He crouches down.)

690
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,390
(What is he doing?)

691
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,690
Come over here.

692
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,890
No, this way.

693
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,320
Lie down.

694
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,890
I'm sorry.

695
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,490
(This is weird.)

696
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,420
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. - Okay.

697
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,690
In 1, 2, 3.

698
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,890
(They seem friendly.)

699
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,590
- Here you go. - Thank you.

700
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,690
- Can I take one? - Yes.

701
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,490
Wait a minute.

702
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,790
I'm sorry.

703
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,390
In 1, 2, 3.

704
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,490
(Everyone lies down next to Kwang Soo.)

705
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,790
Okay. Thank you.

706
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,090
(People line up to lie down and get a picture.)

707
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,220
In 1, 2, 3.

708
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,790
(This is how Kwang Soo survives.)

709
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,260
(Jae Seok is on his way to the next place.)

710
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,390
Is it over when I reach the waiting room?

711
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,590
You're safe in the waiting room.

712
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,290
Will it be over then?

713
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,620
Do I get off here?

714
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,590
(He's the first one to arrive.)

715
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,690
(He's very alert.)

716
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,990
(Suddenly)

717
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,860
You don't need to check my microphone.

718
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,090
Come on.

719
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,490
(Oh no!)

720
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,890
Come on.

721
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,990
What are you doing?

722
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,290
You can't do this.

723
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,390
(He can't let his guard down until he is in the waiting room.)

724
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,820
I can't believe this.

725
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,960
(He can't let his guard down until he is in the waiting room.)

726
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,090
Is this the waiting room?

727
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,390
I can't believe this.

728
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,690
You can't do this to me.

729
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
(Let me check your mic.)

730
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,920
My mic? What a joke.

731
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,920
(My mic? What a joke.)

732
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,420
My mic is fine.

733
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,760
Just one person then.

734
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,560
(He's defensive.)

735
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,360
Okay.

736
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,360
I can't trust anyone.

737
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,790
(Oh no!)

738
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,220
(It's Kwang Soo.)

739
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,290
Ji Hyo! You're here.

740
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,760
You. You!

741
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,490
Do you know where it is?

742
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,590
That's why I'm not ripping name tags, we're all getting them ripped.

743
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,690
(Moving swiftly)

744
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,760
Okay, thank you.

745
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,920
Thank you.

746
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,990
(Awkward)

747
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,190
(He only touched Haha slightly...)

748
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,760
(and Haha gets startled...)

749
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,390
(and almost fainted.)

750
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,020
(He's strange.)

751
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,020
(Sneaking near Haha)

752
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,490
Stop cleaning.

753
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,960
Why are you cleaning so hard?

754
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,220
Okay, then I'll go over there.

755
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,490
(I'll go over there.)

756
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,390
(Moving quickly)

757
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
(Rushing away)

758
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,990
What is it?

759
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,290
What do you want?

760
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,090
Why are you cleaning around here?

761
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,590
The look in your eyes isn't for cleaning.

762
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,690
(Haha has good reaction and catches on quickly.)

763
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,860
(Let me check your mic.)

764
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,290
The batteries are already checked.

765
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,190
(What's this? This is too easy.)

766
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,220
I've been checked already.

767
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,560
(Ripping)

768
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,060
I can't believe...

769
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,290
I really can't trust anyone.

770
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,690
(As soon as they arrive,)

771
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,390
(they are all on their guards.)

772
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,660
I really don't trust anyone. No, stop.

773
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,820
No, no.

774
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,020
(No, no)

775
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,020
No. Why? What do you want?

776
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,760
(Your mic...)

777
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,590
Okay, you don't have to come here. Cars are coming. I got it.

778
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,290
If you come near me, I will hit you.

779
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,290
You'll get hit... Wait, I'm dizzy.

780
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,390
I lost my balance.

781
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,860
(Ji Hyo's shouting stands out more than her ability to react.)

782
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,790
(He's on guard.)

783
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,390
(Let me check your mic.)

784
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,460
(Kwang Soo is extremely tense.)

785
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,290
(He sticks his back to the car.)

786
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,190
(Kwang Soo passes the audio staff and heads for the waiting room.)

787
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,290
Hey.

788
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,690
(You surprised me.)

789
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,090
(Kwang Soo senses something strange.)

790
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,020
(The security manager suddenly attacks in front of the room.)

791
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,290
- Hey, just give up. - Jae Seok!

792
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,190
(Jae Seok slowly slides towards Kwang Soo.)

793
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,190
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

794
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,090
Why are you doing this?

795
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,060
You are ripped once more.

796
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,390
All right, it's done.

797
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,760
- Jae Seok. - This is how you get stronger.

798
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,190
Are we going to be like this with each other?

799
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,760
Haven't you done the same thing to us?

800
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,090
- Amongst ourselves... - Come inside.

801
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,020
- Come on in. - He always does the same to us.

802
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,190
(All Running Man members have gathered in the waiting room.)

803
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,490
- Come inside, we're safe here now. - It's all finished now.

804
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,490
It's safe inside, right?

805
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,990
- We can't rip name tags here. - It's a safe zone.

806
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,390
(Agility Test Results: First place, Haha & Ji Hyo)

807
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,960
(The tests until now were only the beginning!)

808
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
(Missions that surpass...)

809
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,390
That just gave me goosebumps.

810
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,020
(your expectations will unfold!)

811
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,290
Hey, Jong Kook.

812
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,490
(The members aim for the extreme with everything on the line.)

813
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,020
I almost ripped the name tag.

814
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,190
(Today, the fifth most skilled member will be born.)

815
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,090
(They have finally arrived.)

816
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,090
(The Running Man Laboratory for the Fifth Official Skill Assessment)

817
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,190
What is this?

818
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,760
- What is this? - What is it?

819
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
What's going on?

820
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,760
(Hello)

821
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,020
- Hello. - Shouldn't we be careful of them?

822
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,390
I think we're in the future.

823
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,090
- Hello. - It's a tunnel in here.

824
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,660
What is this?

825
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,020
(Welcome to the Running Lab.)

826
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,590
- What is all of this? - Why is this suddenly happening?

827
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Is this "Star Wars"?

828
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,920
(A high-tech laboratory for the Fifth Official Skill Assessment)

829
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,590
(It will now be revealed.)

830
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,490
- What is all of this? - It's the future.

831
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,090
- It's really nice here. - It's a laboratory.

832
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,290
(With cutting edge equipment...)

833
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,390
(and high-class workers,)

834
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,490
(it is a space prepared specially for the Running Man members.)

835
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,590
- The scale is huge. - Look at that.

836
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,960
(Wow)

837
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,090
- Look at this. - I just got goosebumps.

838
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,690
I feel like we're in a sci-fi movie.

839
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,020
What is this, "Agility skills"?

840
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,290
- Look, they're monitoring us. - We're in there?

841
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,390
- Look at that. - They're writing scripts for us.

842
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,620
- My goodness, you surprised me. - What is that?

843
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,390
(They're startled.)

844
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,090
(What is this strange white thing?)

845
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,190
- What is this? - What's that?

846
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,020
(A robot of the future)

847
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,220
(A robot like the ones in "Star Wars"?)

848
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,460
(It seems as if Yoda will appear at any moment.)

849
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,960
(Where have I seen that before?)

850
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,490
- I like these things. - It's cute.

851
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,890
I can't converse with it.

852
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,620
- Hello. - Something like this really exists?

853
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,190
- What is it? - Hello.

854
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,490
Is someone inside it?

855
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,290
Welcome to the Running Man Skill Assessment Laboratory.

856
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,820
(Skill Assessment?)

857
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,090
- It's not a joke. - We're measuring our skills today?

858
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,720
In order to fulfill Haha and Seok Jin's wishes,

859
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,190
we've prepared a special race.

860
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,760
(Big data consisting of 284 episodes and 6 years were used.)

861
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,760
(Members were assessed in agility, strength and nerve.)

862
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,090
(The Fifth Official Skill Assessment has been prepared using all data.)

863
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,090
When all of the skills have been averaged out,

864
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,790
who will become the most skilled member?

865
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,590
- It happened the way we wanted. - We'll proceed with the assessment.

866
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,020
- Thank you! - It's a skill assessment today?

867
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,490
- I really want to win this one. - Let's start from the same level.

868
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,590
Then Kwang Soo needs to cut down his height.

869
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,090
- His height... - You can just walk on your knees.

870
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,190
Why should I walk on my knees?

871
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,290
He has to reduce everything.

872
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,490
He has to cut his arm length too.

873
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,690
Then you have to attach your arms to your legs, Jong Kook.

874
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,760
He'll still be like metal.

875
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,290
- Jong Kook, play in a handstand. - That makes no sense.

876
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,990
Today, for the winner of the Fifth Official Skill Assessment,

877
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,690
a great prize will be awarded.

878
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,790
- A trip to London will be given. - Really?

879
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,190
London?

880
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,860
- The place Gary went to? - London?

881
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,590
It's better not to go. They keep recording you.

882
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,490
I'm not going. I don't want to go.

883
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,090
It's better not going on a trip from the broadcasting company.

884
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,120
They record you for 16 hours a day.

885
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,990
- Gosh. - I'd rather go to America.

886
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,020
The test has already begun on your way here.

887
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,020
- Has it? - Through the sudden name tag game,

888
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,020
we checked your agility level.

889
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,390
When we combined the reaction skill points,

890
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,490
the 2 members who got their name tags ripped 2 times...

891
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,760
- were Haha and Ji Hyo. - They did well.

892
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,860
- That's really good. - They didn't get caught much.

893
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,920
- Because I was so suspicious. - That sounds right.

894
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,020
Jae Seok and Gary tied for third place, getting caught four times.

895
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,390
- I see. - They did well.

896
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,390
Jong Kook got caught five times and is in fifth place.

897
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,090
Kwang Soo got caught six times, so he is in sixth place.

898
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,290
Seok Jin got caught too many times, so he is in seventh place.

899
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,190
Like this, the members are ranked from first to seventh place.

900
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,890
I'm confident in playing this game, but I don't know what color to use.

901
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,190
Pick up the red one!

902
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,820
(Always lacking a little, a player who makes wrong guesses)

903
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,090
(Seok Jin remains in seventh place once again.)

904
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,190
Follow me!

905
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,630
(Is he really lacking a specific skill?)

906
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,390
(Special research will be conducted.)

907
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,190
What's wrong with him?

908
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,590
(Special research will be conducted.)

909
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,820
It's been a long time.

910
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,390
(What kinds of tests await the members?)

911
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,920
- Hello. - Yes, come in.

912
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,020
Hello.

913
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,090
- Have a seat. - Okay.

914
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,090
(A doctor is...)

915
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,190
(in a hospital office?)

916
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,020
You have to fill out this questionnaire first.

917
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,820
- Okay. - Slowly read it over.

918
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,990
(Glancing slightly)

919
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,220
(He's trying to concentrate on the questionnaire.)

920
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,490
Wait, hold on a minute.

921
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,820
- What's wrong? - Wait, hold on.

922
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,490
- It started already? - Stop, don't do that.

923
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,590
No, stop!

924
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,590
(The doctor goes down...)

925
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,990
(and comes up again.)

926
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Has the game started?

927
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,820
(Surprise!)

928
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,160
(It was this person...)

929
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,630
(but when Jae Seok and Jong Kook came running in,)

930
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,690
(there was another person under the desk!)

931
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,290
(One person goes in.)

932
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,190
(One person comes out.)

933
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,190
- It hasn't started? - My name tag...

934
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,690
(Will Seok Jin be able to catch on in this situation?)

935
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,290
What is he going to do?

936
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,190
Oh no.

937
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,190
Isn't it too obvious? Of course he will see it.

938
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,860
- My name tag... - Why are you starting already?

939
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Wait Seok Jin, hold on.

940
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,220
Jong Kook keeps acting like this right now.

941
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,820
- Do your questionnaire. - What's going on?

942
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,020
- There must be something happening. - I'm going crazy.

943
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,690
I write my name and do I have to write my date of birth?

944
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,090
(Seok Jin sees him.)

945
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,920
(He may not be...)

946
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,760
(very quick-witted,)

947
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,060
(but shouldn't he be able to catch on to this?)

948
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,820
Do I have to write my age as it appears on the internet?

949
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
He doesn't know!

950
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,290
Seok Jin doesn't know.

951
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,020
He didn't catch on.

952
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,190
"How many hours on average do you sleep a day?"

953
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,490
I sleep seven hours a day.

954
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,090
I'm being honest. We have to be honest for this.

955
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,790
"How is your daily bowel movement?"

956
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,860
I think it's once every two days.

957
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,160
(Second attempt)

958
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,660
"Write the time and menu of your breakfast."

959
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
I eat my breakfast a bit late.

960
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,760
(Seok Jin is looking.)

961
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,290
(He has no interest at all.)

962
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,490
I eat breakfast around 11am.

963
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,290
(That was close.)

964
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,060
11am. The menu is...

965
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,820
from time to time...

966
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,020
My menu is...

967
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,660
(Jae Seok destroys Seok Jin's concentration.)

968
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,390
What are you doing? I'm doing something right now!

969
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,690
Seok Jin,

970
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,390
everyone else is doing the same thing.

971
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,290
(Embracing)

972
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,590
This is a war.

973
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,890
I was writing.

974
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,630
- Gosh. - Why did you do that?

975
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,220
This isn't right! I'm working right now.

976
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,490
Goodness.

977
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,590
The menu changes often.

978
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,920
(The doctor changes too.)

979
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,190
Bagel.

980
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,490
Seok Jin has no interest in this.

981
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,890
He thinks this is about the name tag.

982
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,020
"How many times do you exercise for more than 30 minutes..."

983
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,890
"until you are out of breath in a week?"

984
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,890
Four days.

985
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,820
"In the past week, how many times did you work on the same..."

986
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,690
"exercise for more than 10 minutes..."

987
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
How can he not?

988
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,590
(It's funny, but now it's become fascinating.)

989
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,190
How is it possible to be like that?

990
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,190
Rarely. Less than once a week.

991
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,920
"Did you feel depressed?"

992
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,060
Not really.

993
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,390
"The following symptoms..."

994
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
(How could he not realise that?)

995
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,420
He is hilarious.

996
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,420
- This is serious. - That's hilarious.

997
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,020
That's funny. Someone should have done that to me too.

998
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Do I have any illness that I should be concerned about?

999
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,020
Since I smoke, could I have lung disease?

1000
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,420
(His eyes are set on the doctor for only half a second.)

1001
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,130
The doctors must be disappointed.

1002
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,020
Seok Jin doesn't pay any attention to them.

1003
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,290
Okay.

1004
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,220
Why do you keep on dropping things?

1005
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,720
(I have hand tremor.)

1006
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,360
Seok Jin thought he dropped something.

1007
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,320
(Is that really the only strange thing here?)

1008
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,520
(Seok Jin's test ends here.)

1009
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,490
Look at his name tag.

1010
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,630
(Seok Jin's absentmindedness is unbeatable.)

1011
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,260
How could he be like that?

1012
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,290
- We should... - Let's put on an act again.

1013
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,320
No, stop it.

1014
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,630
No.

1015
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,630
- No. Don't do this to me. - Why me?

1016
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,920
No, don't!

1017
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,130
This is quite annoying.

1018
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,920
- You guys are still at this? - Yes.

1019
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
We were doing this while you were gone.

1020
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,130
(Then, I'll join in.)

1021
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,920
Don't show your back to me.

1022
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,890
The doctor keeps on dropping something on the floor.

1023
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,390
Don't you mean the doctors?

1024
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,820
I asked him why, and he told me that he has hand tremor.

1025
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,720
He keeps on picking something up.

1026
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,520
He might have hand tremor, but I think your illness is more severe.

1027
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,520
- I think you have a severe illness. - I...

1028
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,290
I hope after you watch today's episode,

1029
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
you don't feel bad.

1030
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,490
I think people will be sad watching this.

1031
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,820
Let's be honest.

1032
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,630
How am I supposed to know when he ambushes me from behind?

1033
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,220
(How should I know?)

1034
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,420
That's not it.

1035
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,020
What are you saying?

1036
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,220
(Seok Jin is so amazingly slow-witted.)

1037
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,520
Stop it.

1038
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,630
What is it?

1039
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,920
- The doctor kept changing. - They kept changing.

1040
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,220
Really?

1041
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
I didn't know.

1042
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,020
I really didn't know.

1043
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,390
That's why he kept on disappearing.

1044
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,920
I had no clue.

1045
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,630
- You really didn't know? - I had no clue.

1046
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,020
This is real. He really didn't know.

1047
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,920
You guys must be very sharp-sighted.

1048
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
That's not it.

1049
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,020
It's normal to realise it.

1050
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,130
- It's impossible not to realise it. - You guys must be really good.

1051
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,520
I was concentrating on the form.

1052
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,630
It's not about being sharp-sighted. It's impossible not to know.

1053
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,820
(Cheer up, Seok Jin. You are only naive.)

1054
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,420
What is this place?

1055
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,460
(The room is filled with presents wrapped in black veil.)

1056
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,420
- There must be something inside. - What is this?

1057
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,130
- I think we need to touch it. - I can't.

1058
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,220
I think this is to test our nerve.

1059
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,720
You are correct.

1060
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,020
I knew it.

1061
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,220
Please listen up.

1062
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,920
Based on the data we collected from previous tests on your nerve...

1063
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,590
- Please bring in the data. - I don't like the sound of this.

1064
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,520
I knew it. I have the highest scores.

1065
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,920
From the episode of Scary Story,

1066
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,460
the number of times we screamed, Jae Seok 13, Kwang Soo 12, Haha 10,

1067
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Gary and Seok Jin 7, Ji Hyo 6 and Jong Kook 5 times.

1068
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,360
The number of times we moaned, talked to ourselves or said...

1069
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,630
"Are you crazy?"

1070
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,290
Jae Seok 33 times.

1071
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,020
- That's unbeatable. - Seok Jin 22 times.

1072
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,020
Kwang Soo 20 times, Haha 10 times and Gary 8 times.

1073
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,130
When you were terrified.

1074
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,390
"Are you crazy? You must be out of your mind."

1075
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,630
"They're all crazy."

1076
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,630
"This is crazy."

1077
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
"Is this for real?"

1078
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,520
The number of times we said...

1079
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,630
"I can't do this" or "I can't go".

1080
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,630
The person who said "I can't do this" the most...

1081
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,820
was Seok Jin.

1082
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,490
The person who said "I can't go" the most was Haha.

1083
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,630
Haha said it 3 times and Seok Jin Said it 7 times.

1084
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,520
"I can't do this."

1085
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,130
"I can't go."

1086
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,190
The number of times we grunted, Jae Seok 3 times, Ji Hyo 2 times,

1087
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,020
- and Seok Jin two times. - Is this your special episode?

1088
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,220
- You're a top ranker in everything. - I'm really...

1089
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,390
- easily scared. - You're at the top for everything.

1090
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,820
- This is a real laboratory. - They did their job properly.

1091
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,020
- They really did their job. - You guys are amazing.

1092
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,420
(The assessment on each member's nerve test is now complete.)

1093
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,130
(The ranking of the members' nerve is in the following order.)

1094
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,720
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Gary, Kwang Soo,)

1095
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,390
(Seok Jin and Haha in a tie and lastly, Jae Seok.)

1096
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,360
The results of this test will be used in the future.

1097
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,420
There are seven fish tanks under the veil.

1098
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,820
- There are seven. - Fish tanks?

1099
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,420
This is Ji Hyo's weak spot.

1100
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,720
- I am really bad at this. - There are seven.

1101
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,220
Because she hates bugs.

1102
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,520
In here, there are beads.

1103
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,190
Beads.

1104
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,920
There are two beads in each fish tank.

1105
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,390
There are a total of 14 beads.

1106
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,020
The person with the toughest nerve, Jong Kook...

1107
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,630
needs to get 10 beads out.

1108
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,020
- Oh, no. - 10 beads?

1109
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,390
- They must have prepared more. - Ji Hyo needs to get nine.

1110
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,630
(Second in rank, Ji Hyo needs to get nine beads out.)

1111
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,920
Third in rank, Gary needs to get eight beads out.

1112
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,490
Kwang Soo needs to get seven beads.

1113
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,420
Seok Jin and Haha need to get six beads each.

1114
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,720
- And finally, - Jae Seok needs to get five?

1115
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,520
Jae Seok only needs to get four beads.

1116
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,820
(Seventh in rank, Jae Seok needs to get four beads.)

1117
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,420
After you have got your assigned amount of beads out,

1118
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,720
then we will record the time and the ranking will change.

1119
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,390
- It's best to finish quick. - I'm good at this.

1120
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,920
- We will reveal the fish tanks. - I just hope it's not bugs.

1121
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,290
- Don't look. - I don't like these things.

1122
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,420
I really don't like this.

1123
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,720
Please be careful.

1124
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,460
(An unforgettable experience awaits.)

1125
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,320
(The things to test the members' nerve is revealed.)

1126
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,220
- How about Jong Kook take the lead? - All right.

1127
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,720
(Jong Kook starts off the nerve test.)

1128
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,260
(I am bold.)

1129
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,460
Can I start?

1130
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,630
Start!

1131
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,390
(There's no time to spare.)

1132
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,290
He is so daring.

1133
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,390
- What does it feel like? - I can't find it.

1134
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,920
He looks like he doesn't feel a thing.

1135
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,290
His arms must be too big for the hole.

1136
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,260
Are the stuff inside the fish tank all the same?

1137
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,020
It's difficult to find the beads.

1138
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,520
They're timing me.

1139
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,360
Are you all right?

1140
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,920
(He is quick to find another bead.)

1141
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,020
What is it?

1142
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,390
- What is this? - Don't crush it.

1143
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,920
What is this? Who are you?

1144
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,390
- Is someone inside? - Someone's inside?

1145
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,420
(He moves on with his mission despite the creepy movement.)

1146
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,620
Get out!

1147
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,360
Oh, my.

1148
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,820
- You're too harsh. - Get out!

1149
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
- Don't make it angry. - Who are you?

1150
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,520
There's something inside this.

1151
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,120
(His instinct tells him there's something inside.)

1152
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,520
There is something.

1153
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,920
Hey!

1154
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,520
(As Jong Kook screams,)

1155
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,220
(others are more frightened.)

1156
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,420
I can't do this.

1157
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
I can't do this.

1158
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,890
They must be crazy.

1159
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,390
Don't make the thing angry.

1160
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,720
There's water inside.

1161
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,620
I hate that.

1162
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,620
(Jong Kook doesn't stop regardless of others' reactions.)

1163
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,220
He's nearly done.

1164
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,620
No, stop it.

1165
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,820
- Don't make it angry. - There aren't any beads.

1166
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,820
(He scoops up two beads at once.)

1167
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,320
- He's amazing. - How can he do that?

1168
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,520
- What's that on your hand? - What does it smell like?

1169
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,920
Two, four, six, eight and ten. I have ten.

1170
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,290
(Two, four, six, eight and ten)

1171
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,520
- What is it? - Goodness.

1172
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,520
(Jong Kook manages to get 10 beads.)

1173
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,720
I was surprised.

1174
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,260
- You guys are up for a scare. - What does it feel like?

1175
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
It was you!

1176
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,090
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1177
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,120
I'm sorry.

1178
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,720
(Why is he apologising?)

1179
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,620
- Is there a person? - Maybe it's something alive.

1180
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,420
- Please go first. - Yes.

1181
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,120
- Us cowards will wait. - Please begin.

1182
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,360
Gary, why don't you go first?

1183
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,390
- How many do you need to get? - You go first.

1184
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,720
Gary needs to get eight beads.

1185
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,920
Get ready. Don't look.

1186
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,190
Hold on to your bowl.

1187
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,520
I have no nerve. The data is wrong.

1188
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,620
Hey,

1189
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,390
from our point of view, you're a hero.

1190
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,890
We're nothing compared to you.

1191
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,820
How can Jong Kook do this like it's nothing?

1192
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,360
Begin!

1193
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,520
(Gary needs to get eight beads.)

1194
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,620
My hand won't go in.

1195
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,020
(His nerves fails him from the start.)

1196
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,220
Oh, my.

1197
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,520
(Oh, my)

1198
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,220
Something bit me.

1199
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,390
That's the normal reaction.

1200
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,520
- What is this? - That's normal.

1201
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,020
What is this?

1202
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,120
Something bit me hard.

1203
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,390
(What bit Gary's hand?)

1204
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,320
(The culprit was nothing other than massage balls.)

1205
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,520
Something keeps on biting me.

1206
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,720
Wait a minute.

1207
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,820
Something bit you?

1208
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,090
- It bites you? - It hurts.

1209
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,720
- It hurts? - What is it?

1210
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,620
- Does it hurt? - So it bites?

1211
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,290
Is it scissors?

1212
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,520
(Gary successfully finds his second bead.)

1213
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,020
Does it bite?

1214
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,390
It's fine. Gary, be careful.

1215
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,620
Be careful.

1216
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,190
Go. Put your hand in.

1217
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,620
Wait. I can't.

1218
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
That's the normal reaction.

1219
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,420
(What is this?)

1220
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,820
Wait. This feels weird.

1221
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,360
- What is it? - I don't know.

1222
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,020
Gary. Gary!

1223
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,220
It feels like a snake.

1224
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,490
(What is this?)

1225
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,260
(The objects inside are massage gloves.)

1226
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,020
- Gary. - It feels like a snake.

1227
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,420
A snake?

1228
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,120
(Scared)

1229
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,460
- How could you do this? - What is it?

1230
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,620
This is normal.

1231
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,520
- Is it real? - I want to do this one.

1232
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,120
This is no joke.

1233
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,490
Why?

1234
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,420
Gary, you're doing well.

1235
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Wait.

1236
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,120
(He screams.)

1237
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,620
There's water inside.

1238
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,920
Why is there water?

1239
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:45,090
(What's under the water?)

1240
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,320
(The things under the water are mudfish.)

1241
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,420
(Gary needs to dig the bead out from a pool of mudfish.)

1242
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,020
Look at his face.

1243
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,920
(Gary tries hard to find the beads.)

1244
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,220
Look at the time.

1245
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,920
Even if it takes forever, I'm not going back.

1246
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,720
I found it.

1247
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,420
- What's that? - What came out with the bead?

1248
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,220
What's on the beads?

1249
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,220
I think I freaked out by myself.

1250
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,320
Don't touch me.

1251
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,820
What is this?

1252
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,290
This is...

1253
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,820
crazy.

1254
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,420
I'm going to try this.

1255
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,720
(What is in the fish tank?)

1256
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,220
Poor Gary.

1257
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,720
(He's got the superb sense of touch. What's his guess?)

1258
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,120
(They are wigs.)

1259
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,590
Is it a living thing?

1260
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,520
(There are all kinds of hair.)

1261
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Wait!

1262
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,020
It's better to do it before others.

1263
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,020
There are too many. We have to do six.

1264
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,090
A coward can't handle that number.

1265
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,720
(Gary finds six.)

1266
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,620
(He goes for the fifth one.)

1267
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,760
(He is focused.)

1268
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,620
(Please)

1269
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,520
- What's this? - Stop doing that.

1270
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,990
- Wait! - You're overreacting, aren't you?

1271
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,860
Wait! I am not overreacting!

1272
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,720
- Try it! - He's not overreacting.

1273
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,820
Wait!

1274
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,120
(What is the thing that's making him have a spasm?)

1275
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,960
(It's the ginseng of the sea, sea cucumber.)

1276
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,420
- Gosh... - Gosh, wait.

1277
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,490
Hey.

1278
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,620
(Its slimy surface is making him dance.)

1279
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
(Gary gets one bead.)

1280
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:31,790
He found it quickly.

1281
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,860
That must be...

1282
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,890
(He takes out the bead.)

1283
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,620
(Gary finds all eight beads.)

1284
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,920
He's good.

1285
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,620
All right.

1286
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,320
(He's worn-off.)

1287
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,090
I want to see what was inside the second box.

1288
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,120
What is it?

1289
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,020
Really? Really?

1290
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,120
(It's nothing, but when you don't know, it can give you a hard time.)

1291
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,120
(What's inside the two boxes Gary didn't check?)

1292
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,820
(There are stainless steel sponges.)

1293
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,860
(And there are pasta noodles soaked in water.)

1294
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,520
(There are different things in the eight boxes.)

1295
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,220
(How embarrassing!)

1296
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,860
(Kwang Soo goes next.)

1297
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,020
- I'll start from the other end. - Seven...

1298
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,490
- Kwang Soo has to do seven. - Gosh...

1299
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,820
Oh dear.

1300
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,420
- I don't know if he'll be okay. - Gosh...

1301
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,090
Don't say things like that.

1302
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,690
What is that though?

1303
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,920
(Jong Kook spreads fear.)

1304
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,920
What is this?

1305
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,860
- Kwang Soo. - He's so annoying.

1306
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,320
- Where did they come from? - He's so annoying.

1307
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,420
They are the two most annoying people.

1308
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,990
- Why did they put that there? - Ready?

1309
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,120
Just be confident. Don't be like me.

1310
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,320
Go.

1311
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,320
Just put it inside.

1312
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,920
- It's warm inside! - Put it inside.

1313
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,620
- What is it? - Just do it.

1314
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,990
Kwang Soo. Come on.

1315
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,420
(Kwang Soo's first objects are massage gloves.)

1316
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,720
- Just go deep. - You shouldn't do that.

1317
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,860
Your hands won't reach them. Put them deep inside.

1318
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,190
What's that?

1319
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,020
(He overreacts to scare Kwang Soo.)

1320
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,320
- Kwang Soo! - It's too much!

1321
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,490
Please press my shoulder.

1322
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,790
- Press it so I won't take it out. - Okay.

1323
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,690
(Jong Kook presses Kwang Soo's shoulder.)

1324
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,890
(But Kwang Soo hesitates to put his hand down.)

1325
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,490
(There's an inner conflict.)

1326
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,520
It's standing up. Go.

1327
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,420
Jong Kook, press him from the back.

1328
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,520
(The massage glove is tired of waiting.)

1329
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,990
(It touches Kwang Soo.)

1330
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,590
(It suddenly touches Kwang Soo.)

1331
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,920
(Kwang Soo thinks his hand almost got eaten.)

1332
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,020
What's wrong? Did it bite your hand?

1333
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,790
Did it bite?

1334
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,420
Come back.

1335
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,920
- You are wasting time. - You've already done it.

1336
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,090
It licked me.

1337
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,820
- It licked you? - Come on.

1338
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,320
It licked you?

1339
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,620
Wait. Just go deep.

1340
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,320
(Kwang Soo beats Jong Kook.)

1341
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,020
(You put your own hand inside!)

1342
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,390
It's not moving now. Do it now.

1343
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,720
It's not moving now?

1344
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,690
- What is it? - What is it?

1345
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,220
What could it be?

1346
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,020
Open your hand. Open it.

1347
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,220
(Something inside it is targeting my hand.)

1348
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,490
Lower it. Lower it.

1349
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,320
Lower it. Here.

1350
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,490
(Mum)

1351
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,390
It's frustrating because we don't know what it is.

1352
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,920
- It's better to do it early. - Come on.

1353
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,720
(Kwang Soo is shaking.)

1354
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,720
Move to the centre.

1355
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,060
(He grabs the bead.)

1356
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
I think it's better if you don't grab him.

1357
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,620
- Stop it. - How can he do six more?

1358
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,790
I won't do it any more.

1359
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,120
Go to the next one.

1360
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,220
(He finds one bead and moves to the next box.)

1361
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
- This is... - What is it, Kwang Soo?

1362
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,620
It licked me.

1363
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,820
It licked you?

1364
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,920
- Did it really lick you? - It licks you?

1365
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,020
(Did...)

1366
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,220
(this kind of thing...)

1367
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,920
(lick you?)

1368
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,420
- That's terrible. - Can't we wear gloves?

1369
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,720
Where are you going? You are too far from them.

1370
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,890
(The second box is filled with mudfish.)

1371
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,790
You are still far away. Go deeper.

1372
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,390
(Gosh!)

1373
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,520
(He's making a big fuss.)

1374
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Something is stuck on his hand.

1375
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,120
Can I watch from here? I will watch from here.

1376
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,490
I will watch from here.

1377
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,860
This is fun.

1378
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,120
Now you know why I made such a fuss.

1379
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,720
- Go inside. - It's better to get it done.

1380
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,060
- You have to look for it too. - That is too painful.

1381
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,960
(Flapping)

1382
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,490
Why? What is it?

1383
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,620
(His hand was like a flapping bird wing.)

1384
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:30,720
Is there water?

1385
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Did it bite?

1386
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,690
- Did it bite? - What is it?

1387
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,320
I didn't even try that one.

1388
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,520
That's the last one.

1389
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,090
- Gosh. - I am dizzy.

1390
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,590
Kwang Soo, just shout and do it.

1391
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,490
(Shouting)

1392
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,220
(He hesitates.)

1393
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,120
(He's starting to automatically bounce back.)

1394
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,020
This is crazy.

1395
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,220
(Flinching)

1396
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,620
What is it?

1397
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,820
(Kwang Soo dances like a popping dancer.)

1398
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
Is it that bad?

1399
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,020
(Popping)

1400
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,220
(Kwang Soo moves like popping popcorn.)

1401
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,420
What is it?

1402
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,090
(He skips the pasta box and moves to the next.)

1403
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,120
- Why? - This is crazy.

1404
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,320
I really can't do this.

1405
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,120
I really can't do this.

1406
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,960
But at least you touched it.

1407
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,720
- I will do all the rest. - This is too funny.

1408
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,890
(He skips the steel sponges.)

1409
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,860
(Shivering)

1410
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,120
When you can't see it, you get really scared.

1411
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,320
You get surprised by stuffed toys too.

1412
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,820
(Lightly tapping)

1413
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
Is it pudding or what?

1414
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,120
(It's sea pudding.)

1415
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,820
- Pudding? - Then touch the pudding.

1416
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,120
- Just clench your fist. - Touch the pudding.

1417
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,860
- Just grab it. - Just grab it.

1418
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,320
(He grabs one.)

1419
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
(He's thrilled by the touch of the pudding.)

1420
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,820
- It's making me cringe. - Time is up.

1421
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,120
The time is up.

1422
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,220
(Kwang Soo lacks agility, but he can do the popping dance.)

1423
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,720
This is the highlight.

1424
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,120
- I'm sweating. - You just have to get four.

1425
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,990
You will be fine.

1426
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,320
(Jae Seok is next.)

1427
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,760
(Will he be able to...)

1428
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,920
(stop being a coward?)

1429
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,490
Ready.

1430
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,020
(He has to get just four beads.)

1431
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,020
Start.

1432
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,960
I know him. I know him.

1433
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,220
You have to put your hand in one go.

1434
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,620
He won't even be able to get one bead.

1435
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,620
- This doesn't make sense. - Go inside.

1436
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,960
What are you doing right now?

1437
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,020
Just put it inside.

1438
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,960
(He already feels like he's touched the bottom of the box.)

1439
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,220
- He... - It's all right.

1440
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,990
You didn't even go inside.

1441
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,020
(He hesitates.)

1442
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,820
- Why is it hot inside? - Jae Seok!

1443
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,320
You only put this much.

1444
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,620
You only put this much inside.

1445
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,020
- What's wrong with you? - But it's slightly warm.

1446
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,520
- It's not warm. - Maybe something is breathing?

1447
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,690
No.

1448
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,960
- It's your heart that's hot. - It smells differently too.

1449
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,320
- He... - Just put it inside.

1450
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,420
Go down. No, go down more.

1451
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,860
- No. - It's following his hand.

1452
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,920
(Screaming)

1453
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,220
- This is really... - Jae Seok.

1454
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,790
(He almost has a heart attack.)

1455
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,620
Let's do this again.

1456
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,860
Don't trust what Kwang Soo says.

1457
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,690
- But it's really following him. - Let's do this.

1458
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,620
- Just go in. - Go to the centre. It's moving.

1459
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,860
Just go in.

1460
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,320
(The glove kisses Jae Seok's hand too.)

1461
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
Something's inside.

1462
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,620
Something is inside!

1463
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:20,720
(He's going mad.)

1464
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,420
- Something is inside. - It's all right.

1465
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,020
Some thing is really inside!

1466
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,120
It's okay.

1467
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,590
It kissed my hand, didn't it?

1468
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,220
- It follows his hand. - Jae Seok, did it bite you?

1469
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,020
Thank goodness I took my hand out before it licked my hand.

1470
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,920
Otherwise, it would've licked and bitten my hand.

1471
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,090
What is it really?

1472
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,490
- I experienced that too. - Is it big?

1473
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:44,860
- I don't know either. - It licks you?

1474
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,120
- It was... - Was it wet or dry?

1475
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,760
- It's wet. - It's dry.

1476
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,860
It's wet?

1477
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,420
(It's wet?)

1478
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,020
(Is it always wet like this guy?)

1479
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,820
Just go to the next one.

1480
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,620
- If you fail here... - Ready.

1481
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,790
Put your hand inside while screaming. One, two, three!

1482
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,120
- Isn't it upset right now? - Gary made us more scared.

1483
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,590
Isn't it upset right now?

1484
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,120
- Do it now. - In 1, 2, 3.

1485
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,420
(High-five!)

1486
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,990
(Screaming)

1487
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,120
Did you see it?

1488
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,420
It came to meet me.

1489
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,490
- It came to meet me. - Did you touch its face?

1490
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,120
It was waiting for him.

1491
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,760
- It was waiting for me. - Did you touch its face?

1492
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,220
It was waiting for me!

1493
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,490
How can it jump like that?

1494
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,590
- It jumps too? - It jumps?

1495
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,760
Don't pick that one. That one is too tough.

1496
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,320
- Just pass it. - I'll pass it.

1497
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,020
- I can't do it. - This is so annoying.

1498
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,690
(He skips the one that jumps and licks.)

1499
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,760
Do it on the count of three.

1500
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,390
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1501
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,520
How deep is it?

1502
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,920
You didn't even get there.

1503
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,220
- What's this? - Let me see.

1504
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,860
That's just sweat.

1505
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,090
What's in there?

1506
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,860
- What's this? - Just do it.

1507
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,720
Answer me, what is it?

1508
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,820
- Jae Seok... - What's wrong with it?

1509
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,520
It's a mess. It's a mess down there.

1510
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,860
- It's a mess. - If you touch them...

1511
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,020
(Touching)

1512
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1513
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,860
You've shocked them. They are going crazy.

1514
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,320
- They are going crazy. - I can see the bead.

1515
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,720
There's more than one thing?

1516
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,220
(He angrily touches them.)

1517
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,220
(Gosh!)

1518
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,320
Gosh!

1519
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,120
Why do you make them fly?

1520
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,620
- They fly? - They fly?

1521
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,720
(They fly?)

1522
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,060
- I can't do this. - Pass it.

1523
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,960
What is it?

1524
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,520
- It's something very new. - Tell us.

1525
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,860
- I really don't know. - Okay.

1526
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,020
- I've never seen this. - All right.

1527
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,390
Is it something you don't know?

1528
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,520
What is this?

1529
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,420
It doesn't look like anything I know.

1530
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,220
- This... - What?

1531
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,660
(He lost his words.)

1532
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,560
You haven't touched it yet.

1533
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,860
What's that?

1534
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,060
What's this?

1535
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
What is it?

1536
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,060
- What is it? - I don't know.

1537
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,290
(Screaming)

1538
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,360
What is it?

1539
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,260
What is it?

1540
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,660
(Pasta can be this scary.)

1541
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,220
I can't do it.

1542
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,060
(Jae Seok gets zero beads.)

1543
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,120
That felt slippery.

1544
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,220
- What is it? - This is the best.

1545
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,290
What are you talking about?

1546
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,660
(He looks miserable.)

1547
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,960
- What is it? - Oh.

1548
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,660
Is it nothing?

1549
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,460
- It comes out here. - What is this?

1550
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
- I don't know. - I still can't tell what it is.

1551
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,920
(It's pasta.)

1552
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,960
(For goodness' sake)

1553
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,060
(It was just pasta.)

1554
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,090
Are you okay?

1555
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,090
(He was afraid of getting bitten by pasta.)

1556
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,560
I didn't know it was this colour.

1557
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,460
(Jae Seok has a weak heart.)

1558
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,160
- What is it? - Okay.

1559
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,960
Put your hand in there.

1560
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,120
You're not touching it.

1561
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,860
Reach in.

1562
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,360
(Haha is so loud.)

1563
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,160
This is horrible.

1564
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,290
Keep going.

1565
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,220
(Screaming)

1566
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,860
- This is insane. - I can't do this.

1567
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,460
- What's this? - Go up.

1568
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,360
- Is it a reptile? - Go up.

1569
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,660
- Is it a reptile? - Go up.

1570
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,220
- It's not... - Is it an amphibian?

1571
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:06,460
It's not what you're imagining.

1572
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,060
- Grab it. - Go like this.

1573
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,320
What is it? What is this?

1574
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,160
- There are hundreds of them. - No.

1575
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,420
Are these snakes?

1576
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,460
In 1, 2, 3.

1577
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,560
(He touches it.)

1578
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,160
(He reached it.)

1579
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
What is it?

1580
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,760
What is it?

1581
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,660
- Hey. - Go the other way.

1582
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,260
(He touches it.)

1583
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,120
(He is terrified.)

1584
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,660
- It actually moved. - That's crazy.

1585
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,390
It moved.

1586
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,020
It moved.

1587
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
It really did.

1588
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,660
It hit my hand.

1589
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,660
- Wow. - Come on.

1590
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,320
- Okay. - Wait.

1591
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Oh my gosh.

1592
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,620
(Haha shouts like a man but gets scared like a child.)

1593
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,560
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin...)

1594
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,060
- It seems scary. - What?

1595
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,260
- Wow. - He found one.

1596
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,290
(He gets one bead.)

1597
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,420
- Keep going. - Go to the next one.

1598
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,060
- What's this? - What?

1599
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,560
(Seok Jin now has two beads.)

1600
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,260
He's so brave.

1601
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,460
(Seok Jin goes for the wig box.)

1602
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,060
(He tries to find a bead.)

1603
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,390
(He finds it.)

1604
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,960
- He has three. - Good job.

1605
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,460
(Seok Jin now has three beads.)

1606
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,560
- He got three. - Nice.

1607
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,160
(Seok Jin is quite brave.)

1608
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,760
(Ji Hyo is the last one to go.)

1609
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,860
- My head hurts. - Get ready.

1610
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
- Get ready. - Come on.

1611
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,020
They're making us touch the stuff we don't even know.

1612
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,620
- What is it? - What are those?

1613
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,960
- Don't lie. - Okay.

1614
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,490
What is it?

1615
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,860
(Ji Hyo can bungee jump, but she's scared of insects.)

1616
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,290
- You shouldn't look. - Okay.

1617
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,460
I think I'm going to cry.

1618
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,390
(She is shaking.)

1619
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,520
Why are you being so girly today?

1620
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,860
- Ji Hyo. - Why?

1621
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
- Come on. - Don't cry.

1622
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,090
- Ji Hyo. - It's okay.

1623
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,460
You've become so girly...

1624
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,120
- after you got married. - It's okay.

1625
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,260
- Come on. - I can't believe it.

1626
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,060
- What are you doing? - Did Chen Bolin change you?

1627
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,390
I thought you went through a breakup or something.

1628
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,390
- Don't cry. - Kwang Soo. Or someone...

1629
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,490
No, not you.

1630
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,560
Jong Kook, can you put me in there?

1631
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,960
Do you want me to put you in there?

1632
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,220
- No. Hold my arm. - I can help.

1633
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,020
No, I don't want your help.

1634
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,220
- I'll grab your arm. - Okay.

1635
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,760
- Ready? - Can I put my fist in?

1636
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,220
- Of course. - Make it pass out.

1637
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,860
- Make it unconscious. - Knock it out.

1638
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,160
I think you should knock it out.

1639
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,490
- Ji Hyo. - Just hit it.

1640
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,390
(Whimpering)

1641
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,460
You still have a long way to go.

1642
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Jong Kook.

1643
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,960
- You have to go more. - Ji Hyo.

1644
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
Wait!

1645
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,220
(Screaming)

1646
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,660
- Are you giving birth? - Keep going.

1647
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,090
I thought...

1648
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,390
- Come on. - I understand.

1649
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,460
Am I your midwife?

1650
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,020
I understand you.

1651
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,160
(Crying out loud)

1652
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,560
- I can't do this. - I understand you.

1653
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,220
You just have to go in.

1654
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,960
- Hold me, Jong Kook. - Okay.

1655
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,660
(She touches it.)

1656
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,760
- It's electrostatic. - It's okay.

1657
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,660
It gave me a shock. It shocked me!

1658
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,360
- It's electrostatic. - I saw it.

1659
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,360
- I saw it. - It's okay.

1660
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,760
I saw that you touched it.

1661
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,860
I understand why you're so frightened.

1662
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,560
- It's okay. - I feel you.

1663
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,960
- I understand you. - It's okay.

1664
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,020
- It's okay. - I understand.

1665
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,520
You should go to the next one.

1666
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,990
- Go to the next one. - Do the next one.

1667
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,520
- It gave me a shock. - Okay.

1668
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,290
- It's okay. - We can't help you.

1669
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,560
(Now it's the pasta.)

1670
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,460
- Let's do this one. - It's okay.

1671
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,290
Did they bring it from "Law of the Jungle"?

1672
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,360
(What is it this time?)

1673
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,390
It's okay because this one's warm.

1674
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,490
- Ready. - I guess it lives in warm water.

1675
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,120
- It's okay. - It's fine.

1676
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,160
It won't bite you. It's not harmful.

1677
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,260
- Just go for it. - It's okay. It won't hurt you.

1678
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,060
Why is it so humid?

1679
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,060
(What? It's damp?)

1680
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,060
- It's okay. - It's really damp.

1681
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,560
It's damp inside.

1682
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,660
Because it needs to breathe.

1683
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,290
Just be bold and put your hand in.

1684
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,760
You'll feel the humidity. It's not pleasant.

1685
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,760
Put your hand in. It's something you like.

1686
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,860
- Keep going. - Put your hand in.

1687
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,560
- Trust me. - Trust us.

1688
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,290
Ji Hyo, trust me.

1689
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,860
- Haha, you are so shameless. - Really.

1690
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,020
- Seriously. - And...

1691
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,290
please don't pretend to be brave.

1692
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,490
- What do you mean, "Trust me"? - Come on.

1693
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,020
- Don't say that. - It's okay.

1694
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,860
- Don't worry. - It's okay.

1695
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,490
- Did you touch it? - No, not yet.

1696
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,460
Did you touch it yet?

1697
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,260
- Spread out your fingers. - Do it.

1698
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,560
(She spreads out her fingers.)

1699
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,760
- Not like that. - Not that way.

1700
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,660
Spread vertically. That won't help.

1701
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,020
- That was so stupid. - Come on.

1702
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,020
- Spread your fingers. - It's okay.

1703
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,460
Keep your wrist straight.

1704
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,990
(She tries to touch it.)

1705
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,220
Keep going. It's not there.

1706
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,920
- It's not there. - In 1, 2, 3.

1707
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,860
- Good. - That's good.

1708
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
- You're almost there. - Touch it with your fingers.

1709
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,290
(She screams...)

1710
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,160
(and falls on the floor.)

1711
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,460
- Come on. - It's not scary.

1712
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,660
- Come on. - It won't bite.

1713
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,660
- You almost made it. - Let's go to the next one.

1714
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,160
(She cries.)

1715
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,960
- It's okay. - Don't cry.

1716
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,860
- Just do this one. - Just this last one.

1717
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,160
- This is the last one. - Just this one.

1718
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,860
- Okay. - Do just this one.

1719
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,490
If this doesn't work, we'll stop here.

1720
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,060
- This is your last try. - This is the last one.

1721
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,560
- Go in. - Put your hand in.

1722
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,560
- What is it? - It's okay.

1723
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,060
Is this something to cry over?

1724
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,660
Don't cry, Ji Hyo.

1725
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,860
- Come on. - Don't cry.

1726
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,560
- I touched something. - I will...

1727
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,160
- throw you a towel. - Did you touch it?

1728
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,660
I touched something.

1729
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,260
- Do I spread my fingers? - Yes.

1730
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,060
(It touched her.)

1731
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,360
(Screaming)

1732
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,060
What is it?

1733
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,220
(She is jerking her body.)

1734
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,160
(He throws a towel.)

1735
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,390
(Ji Hyo gives up.)

1736
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,220
- Stop. - Don't do it.

1737
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
- No. - Come here.

1738
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,560
- What is it? - Wipe your tears and come here.

1739
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,660
You should stop.

1740
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,860
You can swear now.

1741
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,990
- Take a look. - You can swear.

1742
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,020
They're steel sponges.

1743
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,660
- Come here. - It's just pasta.

1744
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,660
You've had pasta before, right?

1745
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,560
Doesn't this make you angry?

1746
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,860
- Seriously. - I hated the last one.

1747
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,960
(Ji Hyo is hard to tell. She was just cute today.)

1748
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,460
(In the order of the bravest: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Seok Jin,)

1749
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,960
(4. Kwang Soo, 5. Ji Hyo, 6. Haha 7. Jae Seok)

1750
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,960
(Official Skill Assessment: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Ji Hyo,)

1751
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,420
(4. Seok Jin and Kwang Soo, 6. Haha, 7. Jae Seok)

1752
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,660
We are all so tired.

1753
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,390
- That scared me. - It's here again.

1754
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,660
- It's Seok Jin's ideal woman. - Next up is the Strength Test.

1755
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,990
- A strength test. - I will check your...

1756
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,360
- rankings solely on strength. - I see.

1757
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,260
- The strongest is... - It's Jong Kook.

1758
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,760
- Who's the second? - I could be the second.

1759
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,260
- That's expected. - Yes.

1760
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,220
- Gary's the second. - I see.

1761
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,660
- Is it me? Not Jae Seok? - Oh.

1762
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,760
- What about Kwang Soo? - Haha.

1763
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,160
- I see. - Kwang Soo is strong.

1764
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,220
Song Ji Hyo.

1765
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,290
(1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Kwang Soo,)

1766
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,660
(4. Jae Seok, 5. Haha, 6. Ji Hyo, 7. Seok Jin)

1767
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,160
Ji Hyo is stronger than me?

1768
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,660
(You're weaker than me.)

1769
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,660
We'll test your strength.

1770
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,660
With your arms tied to a pole,

1771
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,490
you have to make a wrap with...

1772
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,460
all the ingredients and eat it.

1773
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,860
Jong Kook will get the shortest rubber band...

1774
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,990
because he's the strongest.

1775
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,060
(The length of the rubber band depends on the ranking.)

1776
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,960
- That's good. - Seok Jin will get the...

1777
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,760
- longest rubber band. - I see.

1778
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,220
- Okay. - Jae Seok, Haha, Ji Hyo...

1779
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,560
and Seok Jin will go first.

1780
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,660
Ready.

1781
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,960
Goodness!

1782
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,220
(Jae Seok: 70cm, Haha: 75cm, Ji Hyo: 80cm, Seok Jin: 90cm)

1783
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,490
Jae Seok is almost done.

1784
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,560
(Did Jae Seok get the lettuce, garlic and mushroom?)

1785
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,960
(Back to the beginning)

1786
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,460
I got it.

1787
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,360
(The time is measured when they eat the wrap.)

1788
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,560
(Ji Hyo is trying hard.)

1789
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,760
You have to put it in your mouth.

1790
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,490
I forgot the mushroom.

1791
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,060
Ask Chen Bolin to pass it to you.

1792
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,860
(He's so petty.)

1793
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,260
(They both try their best.)

1794
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,560
It's missing meat.

1795
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,660
(I will win against Ji Hyo.)

1796
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,420
(Oh gosh.)

1797
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,490
She makes it.

1798
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,560
- Oh gosh. - She's angry.

1799
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,660
She's really angry.

1800
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,860
This is tough.

1801
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,960
(1. Jae Seok, 2. Haha, 3. Seok Jin, 4. Ji Hyo)

1802
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,660
This is too short.

1803
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,560
- It'll be hard. - Ready.

1804
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,160
(Pulling hard)

1805
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,560
Go, Gary!

1806
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,120
(Jong Kook: 30cm, Gary: 40cm, Kwang Soo: 50cm)

1807
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,460
(Jong Kook is the strongest among them.)

1808
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,390
(He's as strong as a tiger.)

1809
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:54,960
(Reaching for the meat)

1810
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,120
Jong Kook's doing well.

1811
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,660
- Just a little more. - Just a bit more.

1812
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,560
- Keep going. - Just a bit more.

1813
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,660
(Kwang Soo reaches for the lettuce.)

1814
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,360
- Gosh. - Go, Kwang Soo!

1815
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,560
(Kwang Soo is about to eat the wrap.)

1816
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,360
(Jong Kook gets it in first.)

1817
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,260
- He got it. - Wow.

1818
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,560
- Jong Kook did it. - He's the first.

1819
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,620
(1. Jong Kook, 2. Kwang Soo, 3. Gary)

1820
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,360
- Jong Kook won? - Yes.

1821
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,560
(Jong Kook is the strongest.)

1822
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,760
Is this really a fair game?

1823
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,390
- Gosh. - This isn't fair.

1824
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,260
(1. Jae Seok, 2. Haha, 3. Jong Kook, 4. Kwang Soo,)

1825
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,560
(5. Gary, 6. Seok Jin, 7. Ji Hyo)

1826
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,620
(Final result: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Jae Seok,)

1827
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,430
(3. Gary, Kwang Soo and Haha, 6. Seok Jin and Ji Hyo)

1828
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,660
(Gary, the first and secnd winner as the most skilled member)

1829
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,930
(Haha, the third winner as the most skilled member)

1830
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,390
(Jae Seok and Kim Yeon Koung were the fourth winners.)

1831
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,490
(And today, a fair game will reveal the new winner.)

1832
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,490
(The final test will begin now.)

1833
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,820
(A school in Sangam-dong)

1834
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:46,990
This place is...

1835
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,820
As Haha and Seok Jin have requested,

1836
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:54,590
today will be a standardised game to pick the most skilled one.

1837
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,090
So the final mission is called...

1838
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,190
Standardised Name Tag Ripping.

1839
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,490
(Today's final mission, Standardised Name Tag Ripping)

1840
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:02,090
We have assessed the data for each of your strength,

1841
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:05,390
nerve and name tag ripping rankings...

1842
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,590
and standardised the game for you.

1843
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:09,020
I'm really curious.

1844
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:10,660
- If you look under this... - They standardised the game.

1845
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,360
I wonder...

1846
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,790
- Wow. - What is this?

1847
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:15,660
Wow.

1848
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,190
Look at the size of the name tags. It's nice.

1849
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,390
This isn't right.

1850
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:20,590
- This is great. - Why is Gary's name tag so small?

1851
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,290
- My name tag... - Look at mine!

1852
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,090
- Why is mine so big? - It's for children.

1853
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,790
- Don't touch them please. - Why is Kwang Soo's so small?

1854
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,860
The item related to the strength test...

1855
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,590
- is the sandbag you see here. - Okay.

1856
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,860
This isn't right, the name tag size is difficult to play with.

1857
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,020
The size of the name tags are in correlation with the...

1858
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,720
- your name tag ripping skills. - It has wings.

1859
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,290
- This is great. - This name tag...

1860
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,490
is going to get ripped off while he runs.

1861
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,820
He'll be out soon.

1862
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,090
- It'll be easy to rip it. - Goodness.

1863
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,490
Just tell me that you don't want to send me to the UK.

1864
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,460
Where do you have to rip? Is it here?

1865
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,760
How do you rip this one?

1866
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,390
How do you rip Seok Jin's name tag? Like this?

1867
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,660
- Use your fingernails. - Just use your strength.

1868
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,490
- Use your nails. - This is so small.

1869
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,790
If you want to rip this, you have to knock him out first.

1870
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:04,560
- Is that okay? - Also,

1871
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,090
there are three sets of bells for Jong Kook,

1872
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,190
Gary and Ji Hyo.

1873
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,990
The top three rankings in nerve will be wearing bells.

1874
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,860
- Are they attacking? - Kwang Soo is at advantage.

1875
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,090
Seok Jin has only that name tag?

1876
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,190
- He doesn't even have a sandbag. - Right. He has nothing.

1877
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,390
(Seok Jin is the most benefited from standardisation.)

1878
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,860
This is how life is.

1879
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,790
This sandbag is going to affect me greatly.

1880
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:29,390
Just know if you get hit by the sandbag, you could die.

1881
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,690
- Why do you think like that? - Be careful.

1882
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,190
- I'm telling the truth. - Don't say things like that.

1883
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,720
- I don't know what will happen. - It didn't even happen yet.

1884
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,930
Name tag or whatever, I won't leave you guys alone.

1885
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,790
I'm so angry right now.

1886
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,490
Jong Kook, you look like you're going to fly away any second now.

1887
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,260
- You've ripped so many name tags. - But...

1888
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,490
- that could be harder to rip. - It's really big.

1889
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,990
You'll need both hands to rip that.

1890
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,590
Jong Kook's going to fly away.

1891
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:49,760
Ji Hyo,

1892
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,590
I can see your name tag from the front.

1893
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,020
Your name tag shows from the front.

1894
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,390
Ji Hyo, you might end up floating in the air.

1895
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,990
Be careful. You might rise like hot air.

1896
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,390
This is hard for me.

1897
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,890
(I can just do this.)

1898
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,590
You put those under your armpits?

1899
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,930
- You shouldn't do that! - Don't do that.

1900
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,690
Why would you put those under your armpits?

1901
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,190
Let's not do that.

1902
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,490
This is too much.

1903
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,490
Don't rip Seok Jin's name tag in advance.

1904
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:19,490
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1905
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:21,360
- He's provoking me. - Goodness.

1906
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,890
Today's game is worth playing.

1907
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,590
Seok Jin.

1908
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,290
Is today the day?

1909
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:27,590
(Is today the day?)

1910
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,990
- Shall we be the last men standing? - Shall we?

1911
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,490
- Okay - It's today.

1912
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,460
- Today's the day. - I'll look forward to it.

1913
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,860
- Seok Jin, you can't betray me. - I won't.

1914
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,090
(Seok Jin has a mini name tag. Haha has a 1kg sandbag and a normal tag.)

1915
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,290
(Show us your strength, Gary and Ji Hyo!)

1916
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,990
(Gary: second in nerves, third in strength, fifth in name tag ranks)

1917
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,660
(Ji Hyo: third in nerves, sixth in strength, second in name tag ranks)

1918
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,190
(Gary: 1kg sandbag, bells and normal tag, Ji Hyo: bells and large tag)

1919
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,290
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will win using tricks and betraying.)

1920
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,120
(Kwang Soo: fourth in nerves, third in strength, fifth in name tag rank)

1921
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,720
(Jae Seok: seventh in nerves, second in strength, third in name tag rank)

1922
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:54,290
(Kwang Soo: 1kg sandbag, normal tag, Jae Seok: 2kg sandbag, medium tag)

1923
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,490
(The public enemy, Jong Kook)

1924
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,860
(Jong Kook: first in nerves, first in strength, first in name tag rank)

1925
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,360
(Jong Kook: 3kg sandbag, extra large winged tag and bells)

1926
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,690
The Fifth Official Skill Assessment race...

1927
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:06,790
will begin in five seconds.

1928
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,120
Five,

1929
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:10,860
four,

1930
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,590
three,

1931
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:13,930
two,

1932
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:15,490
one. Begin.

1933
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,660
(The mission has begun.)

1934
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,790
Should I hide somewhere?

1935
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,890
Seok Jin has a chance to win today.

1936
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:29,020
I tried to rip his name tag, but it didn't come off.

1937
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,290
(Finding Seok Jin soon will be advantageous.)

1938
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:31,490
I trust you, Seok Jin.

1939
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,590
Today, I will make...

1940
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,290
a mark in my life's history.

1941
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,260
I will rip Jong Kook's name tag.

1942
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,490
(I wil rip Jong Kook's name tag.)

1943
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:41,590
The wings are too big.

1944
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,660
(The extra large wings put him at a disadvantage.)

1945
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,930
This is a problem.

1946
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,490
I just have to listen carefully for the bells.

1947
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,490
Why did I have to wear the bells?

1948
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,090
They're so troublesome.

1949
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,190
I can't do anything secretly.

1950
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,190
Why do I have to run away?

1951
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,090
Bells are for people who are chasing.

1952
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,390
My arms.

1953
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,290
(My arms)

1954
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:07,590
Something keeps pulling my arms.

1955
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,390
Goodness. I have to find Jong Kook.

1956
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,820
(All skill levels have been standardised.)

1957
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,090
If I don't win today,

1958
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,590
I'll have no excuses.

1959
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,690
(I'll have no excuses if I don't win today.)

1960
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:19,790
(Laughing)

1961
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,390
(The complete opposites, Jong Kook and Seok Jin...)

1962
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:23,490
Jong Kook.

1963
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:24,620
(They meet for the first time.)

1964
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Even if he has wings, you have to avoid him.

1965
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,890
(The wings are tucked under his armpits.)

1966
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,690
Now that the situation is like this, I don't feel the need to run away.

1967
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,120
Gary?

1968
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,820
(Jong Kook avoids Seok Jin for now.)

1969
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:38,560
Jong Kook.

1970
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,060
Seok Jin, you must be happy.

1971
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,190
I'm confident to go one-on-one now.

1972
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,120
I think today's possible winners are...

1973
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,860
As today's possible winner, I will go to London.

1974
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,360
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

1975
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:51,720
Kwang Soo, let's go inside.

1976
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,290
(Seok Jin attempts a joint attack with Kwang Soo.)

1977
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,990
Let's not upset each other.

1978
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,090
You have to promise.

1979
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,190
I promise.

1980
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,290
How did I end up next to Kwang Soo?

1981
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,390
Trust me, Seok Jin.

1982
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:05,290
He went inside. He's in the room.

1983
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:07,390
There's no other choice.

1984
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:08,590
(Let's move.)

1985
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:12,390
Since we all have our disadvantages,

1986
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:15,590
let's take care of the people who will cause trouble first.

1987
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,390
I think you'll be the one causing trouble.

1988
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,990
Look at him. He's so confident.

1989
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,490
How about a one-on-one battle?

1990
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,890
Wow, Seok Jin.

1991
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,660
Are you really sure?

1992
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,190
- Unbelievable. - Oh my goodness, Seok Jin!

1993
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,860
- Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin!

1994
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,960
I can't believe Seok Jin...

1995
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,190
- This is impressive. - One on one?

1996
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,590
Really?

1997
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,930
We really won't help you.

1998
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:37,390
That was so impressive even if Seok Jin doesn't do anything.

1999
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:38,990
I feel like Jong Kook right now.

2000
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,860
- It doesn't matter who I'm against. - You can't rip his name tag.

2001
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,090
- Do you want to go against me? - You really can't rip his name tag.

2002
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:46,290
If anyone besides Jong Kook is willing to go against me, go ahead.

2003
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,820
Hey, Kwang Soo...

2004
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,660
It's over if one person grabs Seok Jin and another rips his tag.

2005
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,020
That's cheating.

2006
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,090
(That's cheating.)

2007
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:53,190
That's not cheating.

2008
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,890
Collaboration isn't cheating.

2009
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,390
- During official skill assessments, - Why is that cheating?

2010
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,990
you know we always get the people with advantages out first, right?

2011
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,360
- Get Seok Jin out! - I know.

2012
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,390
- Get Seok Jin out first. - He's trying to fool you.

2013
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,760
Are you going to let him fool you?

2014
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,930
You guys are humans.

2015
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,490
- Or fight us, then. - What I mean is...

2016
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,790
Fight us right now.

2017
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,390
Come at us.

2018
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,090
I feel like I'm going to lose. Jong Kook, are you confident?

2019
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,820
Regardless of my confidence level, I'll fight if I have to.

2020
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,490
- Wow. - What a man.

2021
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,460
This is a real men's fight.

2022
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,290
- This is awesome. - He's so charismatic.

2023
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:24,390
This is a fight between one with and without advantages.

2024
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:28,190
I don't know what'll happen, but the last one-on-one match will be fun.

2025
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,560
I'm curious.

2026
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,490
I want to stay by your side today.

2027
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,360
I hope things go well.

2028
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,720
Shall we go for it?

2029
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,820
I will always root for you.

2030
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,860
Okay, I was watching for you.

2031
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,290
Hey, Jong Kook.

2032
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,990
(Come and see me for a second.)

2033
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:44,490
Hey! Jong Kook!

2034
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,190
Come out. I see you.

2035
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:47,990
- Jong Kook. - Come out here.

2036
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,860
Jong Kook, he is my new boss.

2037
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,020
(Seok Jin is my new boss.)

2038
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:52,460
(Laughing)

2039
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:56,090
- Jong Kook. - Come out here, Jong Kook.

2040
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,990
Seok Jin is my new boss.

2041
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:00,090
Why are you using formalities with Jong Kook?

2042
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,190
I'm still...

2043
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,290
- a bit uncomfortable with him. - He's still difficult?

2044
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,590
- He's still older than you? - Yes, he is.

2045
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,090
Hey, Jong Kook.

2046
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,720
Seok Jin is our boss.

2047
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,990
Hey, you.

2048
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,490
Come here.

2049
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:12,660
(Have patience)

2050
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,860
- Jong Kook. - Seok Jin,

2051
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,590
- if you call him, he won't come. - Right?

2052
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:17,890
(Surprised)

2053
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,860
(They're frightened by Jong Kook's small movement.)

2054
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,890
I'm not ready yet.

2055
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,590
My mentality isn't like Jong Kook's yet.

2056
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,490
That was the scariest moment in the last five years.

2057
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,290
He was always on my side.

2058
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,760
I got scared.

2059
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,290
- I was so scared. - That was so surprising.

2060
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,790
What a surprise.

2061
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,590
Haha and Seok Jin formed an alliance.

2062
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,090
The two are running around together, saying they'll rip our name tags.

2063
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,490
- Kwang Soo, - What?

2064
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,260
if we keep going on like this,

2065
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,860
- We're finished. - we're finished, Kwang Soo.

2066
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:46,860
Jae Seok, trust me.

2067
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,120
(We can only trust ourselves.)

2068
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,860
- Should I really trust you? - Trust me this one time.

2069
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:53,390
Jae Seok, I'll keep my promise today.

2070
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,490
How do I earn your trust? I'm sincere.

2071
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,090
Do I have to live like this my whole life?

2072
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,790
- Jae Seok. - I think you do.

2073
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,090
What are you talking about?

2074
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:04,390
Jae Seok, it's 2016.

2075
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,490
Okay, let's go then.

2076
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,890
(Jae Seok decides to partner with Kwang Soo after much deliberation.)

2077
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,090
Thank you, Jae Seok.

2078
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,120
- Maybe you're planning to... - What?

2079
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,590
- You wouldn't do that, right? - No way.

2080
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:17,290
- You did this to me before. - I'm not that kind of person.

2081
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,190
I wouldn't betray you.

2082
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,020
Let's walk on both sides for now.

2083
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,190
- I... - What?

2084
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,890
- feel much better with a partner. - I agree. Me too.

2085
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,090
Seok Jin has too much of an advantage.

2086
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,290
(Gary tries to join Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's alliance.)

2087
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:32,290
Hey!

2088
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,090
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

2089
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,490
- Did you form an alliance? - Speak comfortably.

2090
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:37,990
- It's not an alliance. - You made an alliance, didn't you?

2091
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,590
If you come up now, you will regret it.

2092
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,490
Are they forming an alliance?

2093
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,860
Is it an alliance?

2094
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,190
- No, it's really not. - Tell us if it is.

2095
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,390
I don't know who he is.

2096
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,460
No, really. I don't know him.

2097
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,760
- Just tell us. - It really isn't an alliance.

2098
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,360
Are you guys in an alliance?

2099
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,990
- I was always with Seok Jin. - No, but...

2100
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,860
he's an assistant I always kept with me.

2101
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,990
- I want to be Seok Jin's assistant. - Seok Jin...

2102
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,930
Seok Jin, are you the boss here?

2103
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,860
- I'm the boss. - He's the boss.

2104
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,990
I just came back from giving Jong Kook a scare.

2105
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,860
- Really? - Do you want to see?

2106
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,090
Hey, Jong Kook!

2107
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,660
What are you doing over there? Why aren't you coming out?

2108
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,790
Are your hands cold? Why are your hands stuck under your armpits?

2109
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:18,890
Goodness, we really have to...

2110
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:21,990
Seok Jin, would you like to catch Gary right now?

2111
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,190
Should we catch him right now?

2112
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,390
Show us how it's done, Seok Jin.

2113
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,560
Should I catch him?

2114
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,760
- Let's go one-on-one. - Seok Jin.

2115
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,190
- How about going one-on-one? - Seok Jin, wait.

2116
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,660
(Seok Jin, why are you doing this to me?)

2117
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,120
- How about a one-on-one? - I'll be more helpful.

2118
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:35,260
- Seok Jin. - Later.

2119
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,360
I am at your service.

2120
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,390
Well it's true he betrays easily.

2121
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,090
I'll be of great help to you.

2122
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,090
It's hard to choose.

2123
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,990
He moves around so freely.

2124
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,090
Seok Jin.

2125
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,790
Jong Kook, are you watching this?

2126
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,990
I've been waiting for five years to pay him back.

2127
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,460
(My time will come.)

2128
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,790
I'm not going to cut you any slack from now on.

2129
01:18:58,890 --> 01:18:59,990
They're trying to form an alliance.

2130
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:02,690
- Who is? - Kwang Soo called Gary.

2131
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,360
Kwang Soo, come over here.

2132
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,520
He called me here. Isn't that allowed?

2133
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,490
- You're the boss here. - You're amazing.

2134
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,120
This is unbelievable.

2135
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:12,490
- Really. - Finally,

2136
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:13,990
- my time has come. - This is unbelievable.

2137
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,490
Seok Jin is the boss.

2138
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,590
He's amazing.

2139
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,090
Please have mercy.

2140
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,290
(In your dreams)

2141
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,090
(Kwang Soo has no choice but to run away.)

2142
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,430
This is the life of a boss.

2143
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,190
He ran away?

2144
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:28,490
Haha, go that way.

2145
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,290
(They missed the opportunity to catch Kwang Soo.)

2146
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:43,590
I missed him.

2147
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,990
This is nerve-wracking.

2148
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,190
I shouldn't go around with Gary.

2149
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,120
(Kwang Soo is next in line after Seok Jin.)

2150
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,690
I need to survive this.

2151
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,890
(Kwang Soo is next in line after Seok Jin.)

2152
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,990
This is something.

2153
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,120
(Kwang Soo has 1kg of sandbag and a normal sized name tag.)

2154
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,390
Okay.

2155
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,720
I need to get Kwang Soo.

2156
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:05,060
(Seok Jin needs to get Kwang Soo out to win the game.)

2157
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,690
Hey, you.

2158
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,490
(Kwang Soo was waiting for ambush.)

2159
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,290
Do you want to try?

2160
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,430
I can't keep running away anymore.

2161
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,790
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are the biggest beneficiaries today.)

2162
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,960
Why is it me?

2163
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,460
You started it.

2164
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,490
(They are both eager to win.)

2165
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:32,790
(Kwang Soo pulls Seok Jin's shirt.)

2166
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,460
What are you going to do?

2167
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:42,590
(I got you.)

2168
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,190
What? You had your hand here?

2169
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,190
(Ji Hyo finds the two.)

2170
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,890
(Gary and Haha also come to the scene.)

2171
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:01,120
Whose side are you on?

2172
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,560
Hey!

2173
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:05,290
(Who will Gary, Haha and Ji Hyo choose?)

2174
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,260
Whose side are you on?

2175
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,990
(Who will Gary, Haha and Ji Hyo choose?)

2176
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:11,490
I nearly got Seok Jin's name tag.

2177
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,090
I nearly got his name tag.

2178
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,790
Seok Jin!

2179
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:21,990
(Kwang Soo is out.)

2180
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,490
I got him. Okay.

2181
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,990
Look at him.

2182
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,090
I'm so tired.

2183
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,190
- Kwang Soo is out. - Goodness.

2184
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,020
- Kwang Soo is out. - You must be really proud.

2185
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,190
- Kwang Soo. - You must be.

2186
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,890
I know exactly how to rip that name tag.

2187
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,490
I nearly got him.

2188
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,590
Kwang Soo.

2189
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,590
This is tiring.

2190
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,490
Kwang soo is out.

2191
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,890
- Kwang soo is out. - It's begun.

2192
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,090
Kwang Soo doesn't deserve to win.

2193
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:59,260
I got out.

2194
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,490
- This is a dangerous place. - Seok Jin,

2195
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,490
when we appeared earlier, weren't you relieved to see us?

2196
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,120
Yes.

2197
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:07,360
- You need to protect us. - Let's go.

2198
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,490
(I'll be sure to pay you back.)

2199
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,720
Seok Jin, I helped out too.

2200
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,590
- Because I came out from that side. - Yes. That's true.

2201
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,290
I helped out too.

2202
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,190
Let's move on to the next target.

2203
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:19,390
- How about Jae Seok? - All right.

2204
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,290
And when we go after him,

2205
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,390
don't do a thing.

2206
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,690
- All right. - We won't do anything.

2207
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,790
I think I heard my name.

2208
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,190
(How will I get out of this?)

2209
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,360
What's that over there?

2210
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:34,930
(They are looking for Jae Seok.)

2211
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,490
Seok Jin,

2212
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,190
act like you're after Jong Kook.

2213
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,260
(Is he after Jong Kook?)

2214
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,790
As if you're Jong Kook.

2215
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:44,790
Seok Jin.

2216
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:50,260
(They are quick to surround Jae Seok.)

2217
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:55,060
(Seok Jin gets a hold on Jae Seok's name tag.)

2218
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,620
(Jae Seok tries to escape.)

2219
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:01,960
Fine.

2220
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:09,720
(Haha falls over.)

2221
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:10,790
Come quick.

2222
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,790
(Jae Seok is out.)

2223
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,090
- No way. - We did it.

2224
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,490
Great.

2225
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:19,990
Jae Seok is out.

2226
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:21,890
- Jae Seok is out. - What is this?

2227
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,020
(Jae Seok could not win against the tight alliance.)

2228
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,090
That was good.

2229
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:27,190
Everyone against me.

2230
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:28,360
Goodness.

2231
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,990
Jae Seok is out.

2232
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,430
- See! - Jae Seok is out.

2233
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,390
I told him.

2234
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,390
Next is probably Jong Kook.

2235
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:42,490
(Next is probably Jong Kook.)

2236
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,260
When Seok Jin comes to get me,

2237
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,790
my last resort is a one-on-one.

2238
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,120
(Jong Kook aims to have a one-on-one fight.)

2239
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,990
My last resort is a one-on-one.

2240
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,790
I can go up against Jong Kook.

2241
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:54,990
I can win against anyone.

2242
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,320
(I'll be waiting.)

2243
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,290
- Kwang Soo. - You're here.

2244
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:59,590
- What are you doing? - Jae Seok.

2245
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,790
I'm knitting this scarf.

2246
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:04,490
Please sit down. You need to knit a scarf.

2247
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,690
You want me to knit a scarf?

2248
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:06,790
(A scarf?)

2249
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,390
I've never knitted before.

2250
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,990
This is really not my taste.

2251
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,520
I'm really bad at this.

2252
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:15,090
I have more important things to do.

2253
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,120
I need to take my revenge.

2254
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,890
What am I doing here?

2255
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,060
How am I supposed to make this?

2256
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:22,790
It's complicated.

2257
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,490
Place this over here.

2258
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,190
(Knitting class begins.)

2259
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,260
Like this.

2260
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,690
Then pull this. You're doing well.

2261
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:31,790
Like this?

2262
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,990
After that, pull the string.

2263
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,120
This is only the beginning.

2264
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:36,290
(This is only the beginning.)

2265
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,390
Now,

2266
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,660
Running Man is teaching us skills.

2267
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:44,390
(They both lack enthusiasm.)

2268
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,590
Didn't I look cool walking out of this door?

2269
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:47,690
If it were some other day, it wouldn't have opened.

2270
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:48,790
(The luck is on his side today.)

2271
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,220
But today, the door opened easily.

2272
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,360
It wasn't locked. It usually is locked though.

2273
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,490
I know.

2274
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,990
- This is my day. - It really is.

2275
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:00,990
- Who's our next target? - It's Jong Kook.

2276
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,020
(Everyone says it's Jong Kook.)

2277
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,290
This is great.

2278
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,320
This spot is great.

2279
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,590
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

2280
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:09,590
Your turn is up.

2281
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,220
I'm against four of you?

2282
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,390
- What? - You four are together?

2283
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,490
We said us four should be the last ones to survive.

2284
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:15,590
(We're in the game alone.)

2285
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,090
I'll go up against Seok Jin one-on-one.

2286
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,930
All right.

2287
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,090
- Isn't that all right? - You're amazing.

2288
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,930
Good luck, Seok Jin.

2289
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,090
Now is the only time to make up for the past.

2290
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,390
- You're really amazing. - You really are.

2291
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,890
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2292
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,690
- I have no choice. - Don't move.

2293
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,490
- You can't help. - We won't.

2294
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:35,890
- Don't help. - Okay.

2295
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,290
Even if I fail,

2296
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,290
- I'll go down on my own. - Okay. I'll stay put right here.

2297
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,120
I want to do this on my own.

2298
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,260
Okay.

2299
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,520
(Both players move to the battleground.)

2300
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:47,490
- Go, Seok Jin. - Go, Seok Jin.

2301
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,690
- This is best. - It's now or later.

2302
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:51,490
(Jong Kook needs to be eliminated now or later.)

2303
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,990
Seok Jin.

2304
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,720
(I will win.)

2305
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:59,090
This is impossible.

2306
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,360
(They started off with complete opposite name tags.)

2307
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,390
You're going to be blown away.

2308
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,590
Hey.

2309
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,390
Let's get rid of the strongest person first.

2310
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:07,490
I think that's you.

2311
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:08,860
Hey, Jong Kook.

2312
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,990
(Will Seok Jin surprise us?)

2313
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,690
What are you doing there?

2314
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,590
Are your hands cold? Why do you have them under your armpits?

2315
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,190
- Look at him. - He's the man.

2316
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,290
This is quite something.

2317
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,090
We look forward to your fight.

2318
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:22,290
(Jong Kook has strength, I have a mini name tag.)

2319
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:24,390
(We are on a level field.)

2320
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:30,430
You only need to touch it.

2321
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:35,590
(Jong Kook's enormous name tag is his weakness.)

2322
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,090
What's happening?

2323
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:39,890
(Seok Jin grabs Jong Kook's name tag.)

2324
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,560
(Is this for real?)

2325
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:44,260
What's happening?

2326
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,490
(Seok Jin gets a hold of Jong Kook's name tag.)

2327
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,960
What's happening?

2328
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:55,290
(Will Seok Jin be able to win?)

2329
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,090
(I've been the weakling for the past six years.)

2330
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:04,790
(I will pay back for all that.)

2331
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:09,290
(Which will it be? Jong Kook's strength or Seok Jin's advantage?)

2332
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,590
(Who will be the winner?)

2333
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,490
(He rips the name tag off.)

2334
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,360
(Seok Jin rips Jong Kook's name tag off.)

2335
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,490
(Goodness.)

2336
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,360
Everyone,

2337
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:27,620
I win.

2338
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,260
(I did it.)

2339
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,690
Everyone, I did it.

2340
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,390
Thanks to the wings.

2341
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:37,320
(Seok Jin won against Jong Kook.)

2342
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,190
- Jong Kook, goodbye. - Bye.

2343
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,260
Jong Kook is out.

2344
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,790
(Jong Kook is out.)

2345
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,890
- Jong Kook is out. - Let's go.

2346
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,590
- This looks like a champion's belt. - It does.

2347
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,690
You should take a photo.

2348
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,090
- Should I? - Yes.

2349
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,420
(Let's remember this day forever.)

2350
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,390
(Haha and Seok Jin promised not to betray each other today.)

2351
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,990
Seok Jin, is it today?

2352
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,920
Should we be the last ones standing?

2353
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,490
Let's cooperate today.

2354
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:10,190
(Now is the time.)

2355
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,620
- Let's take a photo. - Come here.

2356
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:16,460
(Everyone joins to commemorate the day.)

2357
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,590
Let's go with this.

2358
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,290
- Is it this? - No, look at that.

2359
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:22,090
One, two, three.

2360
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:25,690
(What are you doing?)

2361
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:26,790
Hey.

2362
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:31,020
(Haha betrays Seok Jin.)

2363
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,020
Seok Jin only has a name tag?

2364
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,490
- He has nothing. - That's how it is.

2365
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:38,920
That's just how life is.

2366
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,520
I will go to London.

2367
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,760
(He worked hard to protect his name tag until now.)

2368
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,590
Come here, Jong Kook.

2369
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,960
(I can't lose like this!)

2370
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,720
I knew this would happen!

2371
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,520
- Give it to me. - I...

2372
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,620
- knew this would happen. - Grab it.

2373
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,320
(Ripping)

2374
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,920
Hold him.

2375
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,020
- You guys! - It's over.

2376
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,220
(I can't believe I trusted them.)

2377
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,120
You guys, I can't believe this.

2378
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,820
(Seok Jin had hoped to win in the standardised game.)

2379
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,020
It's supposed to be today!

2380
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:23,220
(Getting caught off guard always brings anger.)

2381
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
(Gary and Haha's strategy)

2382
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,390
Make him rip Jong Kook's name tag.

2383
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,120
And then you, me...

2384
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,220
and Ji Hyo can rip Seok Jin's name tag.

2385
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,620
Then we fight amongst ourselves.

2386
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,720
(Seok Jin was just a bait to catch Jong Kook.)

2387
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:38,320
Oh my.

2388
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,520
How am I going to face the other members?

2389
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,120
(His face is getting hot.)

2390
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,820
How will I face them now?

2391
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,220
This is so funny. My stomach hurts.

2392
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,120
Oh my goodness.

2393
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,220
(Today was a good chance for a life-changing win.)

2394
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,860
Let's get rid of the people who will cause trouble first.

2395
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,220
I think that's you.

2396
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,520
You, come here.

2397
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,620
(Times when he had all the powers)

2398
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,620
I can take on anyone right now.

2399
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,320
Seok Jin, are you the boss here?

2400
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:04,960
He's the boss here.

2401
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,860
- Seok Jin! - He's really fooling around.

2402
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,220
Jong Kook, are you watching?

2403
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,890
(It is all useless now.)

2404
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:13,960
- This is so funny. - My stomach hurts.

2405
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:20,390
We should all know by now...

2406
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,720
that there is no lasting friendship.

2407
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,020
And no lasting rivalry.

2408
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,420
But Ji Hyo, what I think...

2409
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,960
is that you and I work well together.

2410
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,620
- And Gary has gotten uglier. - Ji Hyo, think carefully.

2411
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,920
Think carefully.

2412
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,420
Think carefully.

2413
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,120
Ji Hyo, watch. Look at this.

2414
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,520
If Gary and I attack you...

2415
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,220
What's this?

2416
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,220
- Gary... - Ji Hyo.

2417
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,220
this is a nice combination, too.

2418
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,420
(This is a nice combination, too.)

2419
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,860
- Then let's all fight at once! - Okay.

2420
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,120
- Let's go. - Okay.

2421
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,220
Let's come together.

2422
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,090
(Gary has a sandbag, a bell and a normal tag. Haha has a sandbag...)

2423
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,090
(and a normal tag. Ji Hyo has a large tag.)

2424
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,020
- Ji Hyo come here. - What are you doing?

2425
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,120
Hey, still.

2426
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,220
- What are you doing? - Still, you know what I mean.

2427
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,860
Okay, I'll do it. I'll rip it myself.

2428
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,220
- You have to rip his name tag! - I'll do it.

2429
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,490
- I'll rip it myself. - You have to rip his tag!

2430
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,690
(The Gary and Ji Hyo couple go in for a joint attack.)

2431
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,620
(Haha defends his name tag by lying on the floor.)

2432
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,620
You can't rip Ji Hyo's name tag.

2433
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,020
(You can't rip Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2434
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,420
(Haha suddenly changes position for a come back.)

2435
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,520
(Ripping)

2436
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,790
Ji Hyo, you should have ripped Haha's tag first.

2437
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,660
I tried to grab Haha's tag,

2438
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,760
but Haha elbowed me in my thighs.

2439
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,020
Come on, Ji Hyo.

2440
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:42,760
Goodness, my thighs hurt.

2441
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,020
Gary is out.

2442
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:46,220
Gary is out.

2443
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,320
I'm done.

2444
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,660
- Haha or Ji Hyo will probably win. - You're right.

2445
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,990
Oh man, I was used by Haha.

2446
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,720
Wait, that hurts. Hold on.

2447
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,760
I'm pretty good at this.

2448
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,920
It's really nice.

2449
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,320
I'm good at knitting.

2450
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,820
You're really good at knitting.

2451
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:13,420
Right? I'm talented.

2452
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,490
You should open a knitting store.

2453
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:16,590
Right?

2454
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:19,620
- Jong Kook, you're very good. - I'll go shirtless for the poster.

2455
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:21,420
That's a great idea.

2456
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,890
Stay inside all day...

2457
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,520
while wearing a tank top.

2458
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,920
Sit here and knit if you want.

2459
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,320
(Jong Kook's Knitting School)

2460
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,420
I'm really good at this.

2461
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,690
You have talent.

2462
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,890
This is nice. You look very innocent.

2463
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,390
Stop lifting barbells and just do this.

2464
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:38,520
I have to put it in here again, right?

2465
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,620
This is the beginning of Jong Kook's new life.

2466
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,220
- Put it here... - I support you.

2467
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,920
Jong Kook found his niche.

2468
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,760
But really, old attachments are scary.

2469
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,660
In that moment, how could you..

2470
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,120
go on Gary's side like that?

2471
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:51,490
I wasn't on his side.

2472
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:54,420
How was that not taking his side?

2473
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,390
- What do you mean? - Hold on.

2474
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,220
- Aren't you being harsh? - Are you fighting me now?

2475
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,660
(There is only one open spot for the fifth most skilled member.)

2476
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,920
What are you doing?

2477
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,220
What are you doing Do you think I'll fall for that again?

2478
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,860
This is someone who will help you.

2479
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,660
Things were always good when I partnered with him.

2480
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,890
- That's Haha. - Wow.

2481
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,990
- We won many times. - Whenever I partnered with Haha...

2482
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:23,760
(They were always lucky and happy together.)

2483
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,720
Are you in your right mind?

2484
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,760
It's Ji Hyo.

2485
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,920
Whenever we were partners, the result was always good.

2486
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,620
(We used to be so good together.)

2487
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,920
(Now they must collide for the one spot of most skilled member.)

2488
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,760
You won this game before.

2489
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,620
So you should give up and let me rip your name tag.

2490
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:43,420
I'm too upset to let you rip my tag so easily.

2491
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,020
What do you mean?

2492
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,660
You're the one who took all the prize gold.

2493
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,860
Ji Hyo.

2494
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,320
(I can't give up like this!)

2495
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,890
Why are you so strong?

2496
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:54,490
She's so strong.

2497
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,760
Look, she's bending my arm.

2498
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,390
Oh my goodness.

2499
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:30,740
(Haha attempts to rip Ji Hyo's tag with his teeth.)

2500
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,500
You've never seen this method, have you?

2501
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,260
You can't use your teeth like that!

2502
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,380
(Haha is targeting Ji Hyo's oversized name tag.)

2503
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,480
It's a first for me, too.

2504
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,280
My hair is stuck on my name tag!

2505
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,380
(My hair is stuck on my name tag!)

2506
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,720
My hair is stuck!

2507
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,080
Wait, my hair!

2508
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,280
(My hair!)

2509
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:45,680
(She can't even ask Haha to take her hair off.)

2510
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,750
I'll take it off for you.

2511
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,080
- I'll take it off for you. - My hair.

2512
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,980
- My hair is stuck. - I'll take it off for you.

2513
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,080
(Wait, I'll take it off for you.)

2514
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,280
(Ripping)

2515
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,650
Why is the name tag so big?

2516
01:34:56,780 --> 01:35:01,080
(Thanks to a large name tag with strong adhesion, Ji Hyo is out.)

2517
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,580
Okay, let's go.

2518
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:11,180
(Haha is the fifth most skilled member)

2519
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,720
I was supposed to win today.

2520
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:13,980
Did Haha win?

2521
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,620
Haha, you are...

2522
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,980
(I won!)

2523
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,850
I can't believe this.

2524
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,820
I will never trust you again.

2525
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,480
Honestly, the most upset person here is Seok Jin.

2526
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:25,820
Of course.

2527
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,380
(I lost a golden opportunity because they betrayed me.)

2528
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:29,480
- It was his chance to win. - It really was.

2529
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,250
The fifth most skilled member...

2530
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,820
is Haha.

2531
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,380
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

2532
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,720
I give the honour of this victory to Seok Jin.

2533
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,480
None of this would have happened if not for Seok Jin.

2534
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,920
Okay, we get it. Just take it.

2535
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:41,080
Just take it.

2536
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,450
Take this, please.

2537
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,480
Make it a one night stay.

2538
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,620
Haha you should go...

2539
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,820
with your wife.

2540
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,180
Make it your second honeymoon.

2541
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:56,480
(This is why you shouldn't easily trust anyone.)

2542
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,450
A mountain cabin invitation?

2543
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:01,580
What is this?

2544
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:02,850
It's a real party.

2545
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,880
I'm the owner of this mountain cabin.

2546
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,920
(The cabin owner's diamond necklace disappeared?)

2547
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:09,180
My necklace disappeared, what do I do?

2548
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,280
The diamond necklace?

2549
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,720
Someone is collapsed in here.

2550
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,180
It's a ghost murder case.

2551
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,820
This is exclusive news.

2552
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,720
This is the day.

2553
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,350
The criminal is...

2554
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,450
amongst us.

2555
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,880
So is that why you stole the necklace?

2556
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,680
(Solve the mysterious case and escape the mountain cabin)

2557
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,180
The criminal is you.
