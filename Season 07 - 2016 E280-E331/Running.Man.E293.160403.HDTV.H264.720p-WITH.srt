1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,630
The election campaigns began.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,480
The election campaigns have begun.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,870
I will make a vote.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,260
(In the history of election,)

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,710
(this rule was widely accepted.)

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,430
(Majority rule)

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,810
(Unanimity)

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,730
(Is the majority's decision always right?)

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,110
("Unanimity is dangerous.")

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
("Death penalty consented unanimously is invalid" by Talmud)

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,770
("Minority's opinions impact the future" by Douglas)

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,910
(A timely project during the election)

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,510
(Election rules are reversed.)

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,440
(Avoid unanimity!)

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,220
I save you all!

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,530
(Or the winner takes it all.)

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,000
(Majority Rule, Dangerous Unanimity Race)

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,710
(And)

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,640
(Amazing supporters who will determine the result)

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,930
(Park Bo Gum)

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,600
(Seolhyun)

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,100
(Yoo Yun Seok)

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,470
(Seohyun)

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,370
(Who will they support?)

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,110
(The day before the shooting, Mapo-gu)

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,470
(Ding-dong)

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
(Beep)

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,110
(What is it?)

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,240
(Are they giving me a mission this early in the morning?)

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
(Goodness.)

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,870
"Majority Rule,"

32
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,170
"Dangerous Unanimity Race".

33
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,410
(Meanwhile, in Anyang, Gyeonggi-do)

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,740
(The door opens.)

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
(Jong Kook looks casual.)

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,300
Why... Why are you here? Hold on.

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,530
(It's not even the shooting day. Why are they here?)

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,640
What is this?

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,210
"Majority Rule, Dangerous Unanimity Race".

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,640
How could you give me a mission so early in the morning?

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,700
(What?)

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,070
What is this? "Majority Rule,"

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,940
"Dangerous Unanimity Race".

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,300
What is this?

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,400
(They all received the mission.)

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,620
"Please vote for the time to shoot Running Man."

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,110
"We will shoot at the time with the most votes."

49
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,710
"If the result is unanimous, we'll start shooting at 7am."

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,370
If the result is unanimous, we'll start at 7am?

51
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,360
Let me think.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,540
(An inner conflict)

53
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,770
Starting at 7am is too harsh.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,740
This is really making me think.

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,230
I'll vote for 9am.

56
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,330
(9am)

57
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,560
No, I'll vote for 1pm.

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,330
(9am versus 1pm)

59
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,850
Why is it so hard to decide?

60
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,960
(Their decisions will affect the whole staff.)

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,660
If it's decided by the majority, it'll definitely be 1pm.

62
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,960
(He knows exactly what everyone's thinking.)

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,000
(The members would prefer 1pm.)

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,470
I actually prefer 1pm.

65
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,300
I really do.

66
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,370
(She wants to take enough rest.)

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,840
I'd like to work out in the morning and take my time to go to work.

68
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,300
So I'll vote for 1pm.

69
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,400
(I'll vote for 1pm.)

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,710
(Voting)

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,270
(Jong Kook voted for 1pm.)

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,910
I'll...

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,500
(Gary voted for 1pm.)

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,570
I'll vote for 1pm.

75
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,950
(Kwang Soo and Haha are done voting as well.)

76
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,610
They won't all choose 1pm, will they?

77
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,050
Right? They won't all choose 1pm, right?

78
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,670
No way. Can I change my decision?

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,670
I think they all voted for 1pm.

80
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,430
I didn't think about it before.

81
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,440
(Unanimous vote means they'll start at 7am.)

82
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,860
I have a feeling that they all voted for 1pm.

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,740
(9am versus 1pm versus 7am When will they start shooting?)

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,260
(The day of shooting)

85
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,330
Hi.

86
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,760
- What?
 -  It was only one person.

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,070
- Gosh.
 -  I knew it.

88
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,010
Hello.

89
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,800
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,660
(It's hard to tell what time it is.)

91
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,930
Good morning.

92
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,100
I love starting work at 9am.

93
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,350
- I love start shooting at 9am.
 -  I love start shooting at 9am.

94
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,630
We managed to start at 9am.

95
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,740
(Is it 9am?)

96
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,670
(Although he wanted to start work at 1pm,)

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,480
(he was afraid everyone else would vote for 1pm, too.)

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,060
(In order to avoid unanimity, he chose 9am.)

99
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,200
I voted for 9am.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,770
(Jae Seok voted for 9am to avoid unanimity.)

101
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,560
Everyone will vote for 1pm.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,830
(He was certain.)

103
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,150
(Voting)

104
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,140
Okay. I voted for 9am.

105
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,340
I should prevent unanimity.

106
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,830
I'll vote for 9am.

107
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,320
(Kwang Soo voted for 9am.)

108
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,070
I actually prefer 1pm.

109
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,300
I'll vote for 9am.

110
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,970
(Ji Hyo also voted for 9am to prevent unanimity.)

111
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,110
It's not for me, but for the other members.

112
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,060
Gary, Seok Jin and Jong Kook voted for 1pm.

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,430
I thought Ji Hyo would be one of them.

114
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,160
- So did I.
 -  If it's decided by majority,

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,970
- I thought it would be 1pm.
 -  So did I.

116
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,930
Jong Kook scolded me for voting for 9am.

117
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,130
I was scolded, too.

118
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,400
Isn't voting supposed to be anonymous?

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,860
- It should've been anonymous.
 -  How could you do that?

120
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,360
People living outside of Seoul...

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
- want to avoid rush hour.
 -  Excuse me.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,830
- Right.
 -  You go to Gangnam to exercise.

123
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,000
- That's right.
 -  That's true.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,830
He shouldn't scold us.

125
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,500
Today's race is called...

126
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,930
"Majority Rule, Dangerous Unanimity Race".

127
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,260
"Dangerous Unanimity"?

128
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,350
- Is unanimity a bad thing?
 -  Yes.

129
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,760
When you're unanimous,

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,700
- there will be consequences.
 -  Oh, no.

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,300
In case of threats or collusion...

132
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,830
There's only one person you should warn.

133
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,930
Don't do that.

134
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,230
You can whisper it to him.

135
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,230
Yesterday, he called...

136
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,900
Kwang Soo and Haha.

137
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
He scolded them.

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,460
They shouldn't have been scolded.

139
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,230
They were scolded for voting for 9am.

140
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,200
He said such harsh things to me.

141
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,360
- He did that to me, too.
 -  By the way,

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,130
I'm sorry to change the subject, but...

143
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,270
why did you go to the "Descendants of the Sun" team dinner?

144
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,060
- Did he?
 -  Really?

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,800
- Were you that jealous?
 -  I was invited.

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Were you that jealous?

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,330
- I appeared in that drama!
 -  Why did you go there?

148
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,860
- Kwang Soo, why did you go there?
 -  I appeared in that drama.

149
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,660
- You're obsessed.
 -  Didn't you see me in that drama?

150
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,930
Kwang Soo, don't do that again.

151
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,030
- Don't do that.
 -  You shouldn't be there.

152
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,060
What did I do so wrong?

153
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,510
Let go of Joong Ki now.

154
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,460
Song Joong Ki!

155
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,000
(He is in rage.)

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,830
(A downside of having a celebrity friend)

157
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,910
First of all, you'll select your outfits by voting.

158
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,540
Go into the booth and change into an outfit you like.

159
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,330
The outfit with the most votes will be your outfit today.

160
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,900
- Really?
 -  I see.

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,830
- You're not playing tricks, right?
 -  No, we're not.

162
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,780
Keep an eye on Jong Kook.

163
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,160
He'll say, "Why did you choose that outfit?"

164
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,430
Stop it.

165
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,500
(Jong Kook's upset.)

166
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,230
We just have to choose what we like.

167
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,800
- Don't send each other signs.
 -  Seriously.

168
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,530
- Wait.
 -  What is this?

169
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,800
(Wait.)

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
What is this?

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,060
- It smells!
 -  Are you kidding us?

172
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,400
(Complaining)

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,760
- This is not okay!
 -  You can't do this!

174
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,220
Hey, come here!

175
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,500
What is this?

176
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,070
See what you have done to me.

177
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,640
This is what you have done to me.

178
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,900
Do we have to wear that if we're unanimous?

179
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,960
(Why are they so furious?)

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,010
This is crazy.

181
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,130
(What are the two outfits they have to choose between?)

182
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,710
These outfits make me think.

183
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,890
Choose the outfit you'd like to wear.

184
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,060
If you're unanimous, you'll have to wear the outfit to your right.

185
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,270
- I see!
 -  Okay!

186
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,810
This is so complicated.

187
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,340
(Hesitating)

188
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,800
Goodness.

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,040
(They don't want to be unanimous.)

190
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,530
- Are you ready?
 -  Yes.

191
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,660
This is insane.

192
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,960
One, two, three.

193
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,400
(The result)

194
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,110
(Haha chose the normal outfit.)

195
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,440
(Gary chose the normal outfit.)

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,140
(Jong Kook chose the normal outfit.)

197
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,740
(Jae Seok chose the embarrassing outfit.)

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Are we unanimous?

199
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,840
(What's the result?)

200
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,660
(4 chose the embarrassing outfits and 3 chose the normal ones.)

201
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,610
If I had chosen that one, we'd be wearing them.

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
- I almost chose that one.
 -  So did I.

203
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,700
- I almost chose that one.
 -  I wanted to prevent unanimity.

204
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,190
- That's what I thought.
 -  That's what I thought, too.

205
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,270
Why doesn't mine have letters on it?

206
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,530
- Does it have a picture?
 -  How does it look?

207
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,060
(Jong Kook's doesn't have any letters on it?)

208
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm going to kill you all!

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,270
How about you, Gary?

210
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,730
- How does it look?
 -  I'm going to kill you all.

211
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,900
- How does it look?
 -  Why?

212
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,400
- It's worse than mine.
 -  Don't do that.

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,710
- Don't come in.
 -  That's worse than mine.

214
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,030
"I'm a friend of Song Joong Ki."

215
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,440
Song Joong Ki!

216
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,200
Look at mine.

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,330
(I'm uglier than Gary.)

218
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,740
This is not true.

219
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,500
(Jong Kook has changed into his embarrassing outfit.)

220
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,310
Goodness.

221
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,430
- My goodness.
 -  That's gross.

222
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,400
It was during a concert.

223
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,760
Why does mine have a picture?

224
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,370
You do awful things at your concert.

225
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,800
What is that?

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,610
- Why did you do this?
 -  Look at that arm.

227
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,030
(We all wish we didn't have to see this.)

228
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,080
- You look like Park Se Ri.
 -  What is this?

229
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,030
What is this?

230
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,110
(A t-shirt that says, "I am ugly.")

231
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm sad.

232
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,440
Gary.

233
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,930
- You look great.
 -  It stinks.

234
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,000
It's stressing me out.

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,270
This is too much.

236
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
Do you like your outfits?

237
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,640
I love Seok Jin's.

238
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,160
- You're the only one who likes it.
 -  This is true.

239
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,310
(They're embarrassed by their outfits.)

240
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,130
(They chose the embarrassing outfits by majority.)

241
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,580
Today, you'll select your leader by majority.

242
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,160
The leader will have power over...

243
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,340
the other members for an hour.

244
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,400
There will be three elections and you can serve consecutive terms.

245
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,810
The leader will also be given two Go-Home Badges.

246
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,860
You can...

247
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,800
have one for yourself...

248
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,250
and give the other to a member you want to take with you.

249
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,860
As we'll have 3 elections, 6 badges will be given in total.

250
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,170
That means one of you won't receive a badge.

251
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,740
We found an abandoned amusement park next to a cemetery.

252
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
(An abandoned amusement park next to a cemetery)

253
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,860
(An abandoned amusement park?)

254
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,230
The one without a badge will go there as a penalty...

255
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,750
and will have to succeed in a mission in order to go home.

256
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,930
What?

257
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,230
(The loser will be penalised.)

258
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,740
However, that person can...

259
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,340
choose one member to bring along to the amusement park.

260
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,050
(The loser can bring along 1 of the 6 members who went home.)

261
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,630
I'm curious about one thing.

262
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,470
- So one of us has to go there?
 -  Yes.

263
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,070
- It's 2 people.
 -  It's 2.

264
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,500
- The person can take another.
 -  Another person is taken along.

265
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,160
Can't I refuse? Do I need to go if I'm chosen?

266
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,260
You must go.

267
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,640
(The chosen has to go.)

268
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,470
(The night was filled with screams last summer.)

269
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,570
(The abandoned school has only given them traumatising memories.)

270
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,140
(Are you telling us to go through that again?)

271
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,860
(Welcome to a place filled with dreams and hopes.)

272
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,840
The first mission to elect the leader will be called...

273
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,530
Find Your Supporter.

274
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,000
What did you say?

275
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,930
Please pick a mission each.

276
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,220
After you complete the mission with the person written on your paper,

277
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,360
the two people that arrive first at the next location...

278
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,990
will be given the chance to run for election.

279
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,130
(The first mission is Find Your Supporter.)

280
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,630
(The members each get a mission that they need to complete.)

281
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,510
(The first 2 to complete their missions will become candidates.)

282
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,000
(Find Your Supporter)

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,510
I need to get a stamp...

284
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,130
from a celebrity that has a 12-year age gap from me.

285
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,010
(Grant a wish made by a celebrity in that age gap.)

286
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,070
Please don't get me wrong. Last time I was paired with...

287
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,470
Kim Won Hae who is 12 years older than me.

288
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,970
But today, I will meet someone...

289
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,370
who is 12 years younger than me.

290
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,170
Am I going to meet Park Bo Gum today?

291
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,970
Oh, my. What if Bo Gum comes?

292
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,440
Oh, my goodness.

293
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,070
(Bo Gum, I hope we meet today.)

294
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,280
(She needs to get his number.)

295
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,410
I'm leaving.

296
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,040
(Grant a wish made by a beautiful ambassador for general election.)

297
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,770
Are you going to see Seolhyun?

298
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,370
Yes!

299
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,560
(He quickly got a hold of Seolhyun's manager.)

300
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,540
I got her manager's number.

301
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,360
I couldn't get Seolhyun's.

302
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,770
- Hello?
 -  Hello?

303
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,440
Yes?

304
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,160
- Are you Seolhyun's manager?
 -  Yes.

305
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,940
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

306
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,710
I need to meet Seolhyun because of a mission.

307
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,570
Are you with her at the moment?

308
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Yes, please wait a minute.

309
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,030
I think she's fetching her.

310
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,170
(Will he be able to talk to her?)

311
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,430
(Gary was in love with Seolhyun the moment he met her.)

312
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,960
Stop filming me. Don't do that.

313
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,470
My heart is racing.

314
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,640
(Will he be able to meet Seolhyun once again?)

315
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,760
Hello?

316
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,040
- Is this Seolhyun?
 -  Yes.

317
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,200
(His heart is racing.)

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,860
- Is this Seolhyun?
 -  Yes.

319
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,340
(It's Seolhyun!)

320
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,900
Hello, Seolhyun.

321
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,830
Hello, Gary.

322
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,610
- I know you're busy.
 -  Yes?

323
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,280
But I need to meet you because of a mission.

324
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,810
Could you please spare some time for me?

325
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,930
Sure, of course.

326
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,240
Wait just a little.

327
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,570
How long will it take you to arrive?

328
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,100
- I'll be there in 30 minutes.
 -  Okay.

329
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,600
I'll drive at the speed of 200km per hour.

330
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,660
(I'll race against time for you.)

331
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,900
No, please drive safely.

332
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,240
All right.

333
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,640
- Okay.
 -  Bye.

334
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,530
Oh, no. I really don't know anyone who was born in 1997.

335
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,070
(Grant a wish of a celebrity who's voting for the first time.)

336
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,140
Let's see who was born in 1997.

337
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,540
There's Kwak Dong Yeon.

338
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,760
Kwak Dong Yeon, who performed...

339
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,870
in a drama with me recently, was born in 1997.

340
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,240
I didn't know that he was born in 1997.

341
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,670
(He calls him immediately to carry out the mission.)

342
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,740
- Hello?
 -  Hello, Dong Yeon.

343
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,510
- Hello, Kwang Soo.
 -  Where are you?

344
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm on my way to Everland Amusement Park.

345
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,630
- Ever... Oh, really?
 -  Yes.

346
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,360
Why are you going there?

347
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,830
To... To hang out.

348
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,330
- I see. You're hanging out there.
 -  Yes.

349
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,660
All right.

350
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,140
(Sighing)

351
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,030
He's going to the amusement park.

352
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,940
(He went to the amusement park.)

353
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,630
I used to go to the amusement park often when I was in my 20s.

354
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,910
(He reminisces.)

355
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,340
How are you?

356
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,540
(We'll say that he was just saying hello to the tigers at the zoo.)

357
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,610
I just searched right now and found Jaekyung.

358
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,830
Jaekyung of Rainbow was...

359
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,070
a student representative back in high school.

360
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,970
Look.

361
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,140
She was a student representative at Deungchon High School.

362
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,770
BoA was also a representative at Yangjeong Elementary School.

363
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,760
How can I meet Jaekyung?

364
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,200
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes, Haha?

365
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,900
Do you have Jaekyung's phone number?

366
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,230
- Jaekyung?
 -  Yes.

367
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,110
- Of Rainbow.
 -  I don't have her number.

368
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,030
Do you know Yoo Yun Seok?

369
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,360
- I know Yun Seok.
 -  Do you?

370
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,740
- Yes.
 -  Give me his number now.

371
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,340
I know Yu Seung Woo's number. That works, right?

372
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,770
- Here you go. 010...
 -  Okay.

373
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,770
And 7148.

374
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,400
You need to tell me his number, too.

375
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,930
- I'll call him.
 -  What?

376
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,640
- To see if it's the right number.
 -  It's the right number!

377
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,530
- Quickly. I don't have the time.
 -  Wait.

378
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,340
- I'm calling the number.
 -  You can do that later.

379
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,410
- Call him later.
 -  He's not picking up.

380
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,240
It's because you're calling from an unknown number.

381
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,460
Trust me.

382
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,470
He's not picking up. You look like you're lying.

383
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,240
Text him first. Introduce yourself.

384
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,150
- You're driving me crazy.
 -  You're lying.

385
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,140
- This isn't his, right? Hello?
 -  Yes?

386
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,340
- Seung Woo?
 -  Yes?

387
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,010
(Yes?)

388
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,300
- Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.
 -  I told you.

389
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,800
He picked up.

390
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,230
Talk to him later.

391
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,730
Hang up first.

392
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,260
It's the right number. Hey!

393
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,000
(Kwang Soo runs away at full speed.)

394
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,040
- Seung Woo!
 -  Are you a scammer?

395
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,270
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.

396
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,170
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

397
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,330
Excuse me, but where are you at the moment?

398
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,940
(Only 2 can become the candidates.)

399
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,210
- You're at home?
 -  Yes.

400
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,740
- By any chance,
 -  Yes?

401
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,440
if you're free today, could you spare 10 minutes to complete...

402
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,340
a mission? Do you have time?

403
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,940
Yes, I do.

404
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,110
Thank you.

405
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,540
- You're welcome.
 -  Where do you live?

406
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,740
- I live in Seocho-gu.
 -  Seocho-gu, I see.

407
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,580
I'll call you when I arrive.

408
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,170
- Okay.
 -  Thank you.

409
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,400
Isn't the mission too difficult?

410
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
(Jae Seok is near Ewha Women's University.)

411
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,640
I need to find a person who is very flexible.

412
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,650
If we go too much forward...

413
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,070
(Find a student who can wrap their arm around their waist.)

414
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,050
She's on her way to school.

415
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,270
Watch out.

416
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,060
(He found a university student.)

417
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,340
Excuse me, are you on your way to school?

418
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
Are you...

419
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,380
(Jae Seok is in front of me.)

420
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,500
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

421
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,810
I'm sorry for disturbing your morning.

422
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,530
I'm sorry, you must be tired.

423
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,040
Could I ask you for a favour?

424
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,720
Do you know that pose where you wrap your arm around your waist?

425
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
- Sorry?
 -  It's popular these days.

426
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,130
Wrap your arm around your waist and touch your belly button. I can't.

427
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,400
I don't think I can.

428
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,540
- Right? Wait, can you?
 -  Maybe if I reach under my clothes.

429
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,330
(She slides her arm behind her.)

430
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,610
Didn't you succeed?

431
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,870
She did it.

432
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,440
(She succeeded in no time.)

433
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,430
You succeeded in one go.

434
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,930
(She looks calm for someone who has won a mission.)

435
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,970
Oh, my. How could you do that?

436
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,210
(She does it again as if it's nothing.)

437
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
(Even her "Wow!" sounds dull.)

438
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,190
This is really amazing.

439
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,330
Were you on your way to class?

440
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,280
- I'm going to buy coffee.
 -  Coffee?

441
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,160
Oh, my.

442
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,730
- You should buy her coffee.
 -  I was about to do just that.

443
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,330
Shall we go buy a cup of coffee?

444
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,530
It's all right.

445
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,100
(She immediately refuses.)

446
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,630
She says it's fine.

447
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,860
Gosh.

448
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,330
Thank you.

449
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,130
Please take care.

450
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,530
- Goodbye.
 -  Goodbye.

451
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,310
- Good luck.
 -  Goodbye.

452
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,010
What should I do now?

453
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,040
You should go to the next location.

454
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,530
- Congratulations.
 -  That was fast.

455
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,140
Is it possible to complete the mission that fast?

456
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,540
(It didn't work when I tried it. What will I do to fill up the time?)

457
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,230
(Tongin Market)

458
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,540
Oh, my.

459
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,410
I'm at Tongin Market.

460
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,800
What should I eat? Should I eat soondubu?

461
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,270
(Go to a traditional market and make them say, "Wow, you eat well!")

462
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,270
Look at those dumplings. Wow.

463
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,130
(Diverse dishes are lined up in this traditional market.)

464
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,460
They look delicious.

465
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,750
There's an old lady.

466
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,210
An old lady will probably say those words easily.

467
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,300
Hello.

468
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,640
- Soy sauce and oil tteokbokki.
 -  Yes.

469
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,170
I heard that they're really tasty here.

470
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,830
This must be oil tteokbokki. I'll have a serving.

471
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,740
(Oil tteokbokki is a specialty at this market.)

472
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,560
It looks delicious.

473
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,700
(Was the mission too easy?)

474
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,370
- Here you go.
 -  Thank you.

475
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,100
Please watch me eat.

476
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,510
- Should I watch how well you eat?
 -  Yes.

477
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,110
I'll eat this much at once.

478
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,210
- Eat like this.
 -  Please watch me eat.

479
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,510
(Munching)

480
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,910
(Savouring)

481
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,510
I should take a big bite.

482
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,280
Then the owner will compliment on how well I eat.

483
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,140
(Will he hit a home run at his first bat?)

484
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,940
It tastes best if you chew well like that.

485
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,570
(He is disappointed.)

486
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,330
- Don't I eat better than others?
 -  Yes.

487
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,400
I'm gulping this down.

488
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,830
No, they all eat like that.

489
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,360
(What do you know?)

490
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,840
Is that so?

491
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,530
Ma'am, I would like some water, please.

492
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,470
Enjoy it. The water is tasty, too.

493
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,020
(I'll end the mission with this water.)

494
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,540
Maybe I should eat in a hurry.

495
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,940
The water should be tasty. Enjoy as much as you want.

496
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,710
(He's acting tough.)

497
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,530
(Please compliment on how well I eat.)

498
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,940
- Did you watch me drink that water?
 -  Yes.

499
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,870
(I have a feeling becoming a candidate will be difficult.)

500
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,640
I'll call Park Bo Gum's manager.

501
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,730
Hello. Is this Park Bo Gum's manager?

502
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,940
(Is she on the phone with his manager?)

503
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,660
Jun Yeol, this is Ji Hyo.

504
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,360
Are you guys that close?

505
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,160
- Do you know...
 -  You were born in 1981, right?

506
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,670
- Park Bo Gum's number?
 -  1981...

507
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,110
- Bo Gum's number?
 -  Yes.

508
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,940
Hold on. Bo Gum's number...

509
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,780
Can I ask him for his permission before I give it to you?

510
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,390
(Ryu Jun Yeol is protective of his friend.)

511
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,500
(What a humiliation!)

512
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,740
- Actually... Hey.
 -  Right, you should ask!

513
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,160
I got his number! I got it!

514
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,270
(She has forgotten all humiliation.)

515
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,100
Jun Yeol sent me.

516
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,730
(Jun Yeol sent her Bo Gum's number.)

517
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,190
- Hello, Bo Gum.
 -  Hello.

518
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,400
Do you have time now? I'm 12 years older than you.

519
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,280
I'm shooting something right now. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?

520
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,510
Yes, sure.

521
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,270
Then I'll call you back in 30 minutes.

522
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,800
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

523
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,670
All right. I'll be waiting.

524
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,870
What should I do for 30 minutes?

525
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,560
(I'm probably at the very bottom right now.)

526
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,110
30 minutes are not a big deal if I can see Bo Gum.

527
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,870
Spring wind blows

528
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,970
(Bring Bo Gum to me along with the spring wind!)

529
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,730
(Gary is on his way to meet Seolhyun.)

530
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm here.

531
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,570
- Good luck.
 -  Thank you!

532
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,400
Thank you, Sir.

533
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
(Gary came to see Seolhyun at a hair salon.)

534
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,100
Gosh, my back hurts.

535
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
(Gary came to see Seolhyun at a hair salon.)

536
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,430
This outfit is really embarrassing.

537
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,800
(Gary's ugly top embarrasses him.)

538
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,630
(Let me at least cover the ugly letters.)

539
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,670
Hello.

540
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,260
Hello.

541
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,540
- Is Seolhyun here?
 -  Hello. Yes.

542
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,000
(Hey, Seolhyun.)

543
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,130
Thanks.

544
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,340
(I'm here for you.)

545
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,210
Is she here?

546
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,030
- Here you are.
 -  Hello.

547
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,630
(Pretty Seolhyun is here.)

548
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,130
- You look even prettier today.
 -  You're too kind.

549
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,440
(Gary successfully meets Seolhyun who is well sought-after.)

550
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,100
(Seolhyun has become famous...)

551
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,830
(in commercials...)

552
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,200
(and music shows.)

553
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,510
Look at your shirt.

554
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,430
I had no choice but to wear this.

555
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,200
- Really?
 -  I might smell like squid.

556
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,370
Okay.

557
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,910
Gary, she watched the show last night.

558
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,440
Really? Oh, gosh.

559
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,200
Can you tell us how he reacted when he saw Seolhyun's photo?

560
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
He showed some kind of...

561
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
- Desire?
 -  sexual...

562
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,100
- You piece of trash!
 -  Gosh.

563
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,390
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Hey!

564
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,550
It was against my will!

565
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,340
It was my brain, not me!

566
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,800
Seolhyun, you know that...

567
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,910
it is overstated to make the show more fun.

568
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,000
- I believe you understand that.
 -  Yes, I do.

569
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,530
- You said it was against your will.
 -  I'm so embarrassed!

570
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,310
What? My mission today...

571
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,940
is to meet an ambassador for general election...

572
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,500
and make her wish come true to get a stamp.

573
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,900
I see.

574
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,300
You were the only one I could think of.

575
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,700
- Okay.
 -  So...

576
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,570
So do I need to tell you my wish?

577
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,740
Seolhyun, tell me something easy, okay?

578
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,170
Then,

579
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,700
I have to go to the set for shooting now.

580
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,670
Can you take me there?

581
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,160
Sure. Where is it? Is it in Busan?

582
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,830
No. It's nearby.

583
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,040
- Really?
 -  Yes.

584
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,710
- Then, I'll take you there.
 -  Okay, thanks.

585
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Hello.

586
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,510
- Hey.
 -  Yes?

587
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,260
- Are you shooting now?
 -  Yes, I am.

588
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,710
Haha called you, didn't he?

589
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,260
- He did.
 -  You don't have to meet him.

590
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,160
(Kwang Soo is planning something.)

591
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,000
I... I already agreed to go.

592
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,070
Are you going to meet him?

593
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,550
Yes. Actually, I just woke up.

594
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,540
Then give him a difficult mission.

595
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,500
It will be meaningless if you give him an easy one.

596
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll clear my mission quickly and come see you.

597
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,140
- Oh, okay.
 -  Thanks, bye.

598
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,700
Bye.

599
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,810
(Will Kwang Soo's plot work?)

600
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
Hello, Seung Woo.

601
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
- Haha.
 -  Yes.

602
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,900
So should I not meet him at all?

603
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,300
- No. You should meet him.
 -  Okay.

604
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,830
Meet him but take your time.

605
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,520
Say, "I'm sorry to make you wait. But I should get changed first."

606
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,310
- Okay.
 -  Where are you now?

607
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,000
- I'm home.
 -  Sorry?

608
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,100
I just woke up.

609
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,430
Okay. Just buy as much time as possible.

610
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,080
- Okay.
 -  Good.

611
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,780
And keep reporting me what is going on there.

612
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,770
- Okay.
 -  Great.

613
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,570
(What will happen to these two?)

614
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,560
If it were nearer, we could've walked there instead.

615
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,530
- The weather's nice.
 -  Right. The weather is so nice.

616
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,610
The weather is just right to take a walk. There's a park, too.

617
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,060
Did you see when they compared me to a squid?

618
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,670
Yes, I did.

619
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,710
What do you think about it?

620
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,270
I couldn't understand why they said you looked like a squid at first.

621
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,270
But hearing what the doctor said,

622
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,710
I became easily convinced.

623
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,450
(She thinks he looks like a squid.)

624
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,710
So when you saw the photo of me next to a squid,

625
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,600
did you think that we looked similar?

626
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,700
(Did we look similar?)

627
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Yes.

628
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,170
(Yes.)

629
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,630
Even I was shocked to see how similar we were.

630
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,740
Do you like guys with round faces...

631
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,530
or those who look a bit ambiguous?

632
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,600
I like guys with round faces.

633
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,100
- I see.
 -  My ideal type is Song Joong Ki.

634
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,040
Really? You like him, too?

635
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,500
Kwang Soo will get more upset when he hears this.

636
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,260
I've been liking him for a long time.

637
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,410
- Really?
 -  Yes.

638
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,960
I can see how much you like him.

639
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,400
What? It's Kwang Soo.

640
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,510
(Speak of the devil.)

641
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,360
Hi, Kwang Soo.

642
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,430
- Gary.
 -  Yes.

643
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,440
Are you on your way?

644
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,410
I already met Seolhyun.

645
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,040
You did?

646
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,770
Yes, she is with me now.

647
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,730
But she just said something quite cruel about you.

648
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,700
What do you mean? What did she say?

649
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,770
She said her ideal type is Song Joong Ki.

650
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,080
(It's painful.)

651
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,340
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes?

652
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,840
You'd better give up on her.

653
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,610
I'll tell her all of Joong Ki's secrets to make her hate him.

654
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,000
Although she doesn't know his secrets,

655
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,910
I'm sure she'll even love them.

656
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,700
- That's true.
 -  Right?

657
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,360
Yes, that is so true.

658
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,810
Excuse me, Sir. Please drop her off now.

659
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,770
Just get off here and walk.

660
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,290
- I'm sorry.
 -  Kwang Soo.

661
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,340
- Yes?
 -  We should drink tonight.

662
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,070
Thank you, Seolhyun.

663
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,100
Thank you for making time.

664
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,210
(Seolhyun is about to stamp.)

665
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
Joong Ki, Joong Ki.

666
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,670
- Sorry?
 -  Think about Joong Ki.

667
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,440
Kwang Soo and Joong Ki are close, so you may meet Joong Ki soon.

668
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,710
- Then should I stamp this?
 -  Of course.

669
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,840
(She stamps it.)

670
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,100
(Gary successfully completes the mission and gets a stamp.)

671
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,530
Thank you, Seolhyun.

672
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,710
- You're welcome.
 -  I even used Joong Ki for this.

673
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,900
- Hope you do well today.
 -  Okay.

674
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,000
- You can do it.
 -  Thanks.

675
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
- Make a lot of money.
 -  Okay.

676
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,790
- You can do it.
 -  You, too.

677
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,160
- Goodbye.
 -  Take care.

678
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,140
- Goodbye, my lady.
 -  Goodbye.

679
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,820
Yes, Seung Woo.

680
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,840
- Haha.
 -  Yes?

681
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,330
He said he will be here in 5 to 10 minutes.

682
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,430
Really?

683
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,400
Then tell him to wait a little more. Say, "My manger just called me..."

684
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
"and said my stylist wants me..."

685
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,160
"to get changed..."

686
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,040
"and put makeup on". Just buy some time.

687
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,560
Okay.

688
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,780
Good. Do that for 15 minutes.

689
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,900
Okay.

690
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,530
(Kwang Soo also calls Yun Seok with the same motive.)

691
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,740
- Hello.
 -  Yun Seok.

692
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,540
- Yes.
 -  Please take your time.

693
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,810
- What?
 -  When Haha arrives,

694
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,200
don't go out right away. Go out after some time.

695
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
(I want you to buy some time.)

696
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,610
Why?

697
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,670
I think I should...

698
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,770
teach him some lesson this time.

699
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,330
- You should do that.
 -  Okay, I will.

700
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,370
Thanks, Yun Seok.

701
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,000
- Okay.
 -  Bye.

702
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,700
(Seung Woo and Yun Seok are both asked to buy some time.)

703
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,040
Now, I got Haha.

704
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,900
(But you have 5 more to win.)

705
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,870
What should I do to be the first or second?

706
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,440
(Kwang Soo arrives at the place to meet Seung Woo.)

707
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,560
(He hastily tries to contact Seung Woo.)

708
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,090
- Hello.
 -  Seung Woo.

709
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,140
- Yes.
 -  I just arrived.

710
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,460
- Oh, you did?
 -  Yes.

711
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,700
- Where should I wait?
 -  Well,

712
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,950
- Yes.
 -  you can see McDonald's near there.

713
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,540
Oh, that's where I am now.

714
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,070
- Really?
 -  Yes.

715
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,530
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the restroom first.

716
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,040
Oh, you need to go to the restroom.

717
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,160
- Okay.
 -  I'll see you soon.

718
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,940
Okay, I'll be waiting for you here at the McDonald's.

719
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,310
- Okay.
 -  Bye.

720
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
(Kwang Soo waits with a cup of coffee to give him.)

721
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,240
I guess he has a stomach problem.

722
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't want a lot

723
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,510
(Haha also arrives at Yun Seok's place.)

724
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,210
- Hello.
 -  Yun Seok.

725
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,470
- Yes.
 -  I'm sorry, but I'm already here.

726
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,670
- Really?
 -  Yes, I just arrived.

727
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh... Okay, I'll be there shortly.

728
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,310
Okay. When we meet each other, please welcome me with a hug.

729
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,780
- Okay.
 -  Thank you.

730
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,810
Bye.

731
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,340
Yun Seok...

732
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,060
sounds so nice.

733
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,310
I can feel how nice he is. He's different from you, Kwang Soo.

734
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,340
Okay? He's different from you.

735
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,900
I think I'm going to catch a cold.

736
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,530
(He has reached his limit.)

737
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,830
(He feels that something is wrong.)

738
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,470
This must be Haha's doing.

739
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
(Upset)

740
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,840
(Answer it now.)

741
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,910
- Hello?
 -  Haha.

742
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,960
- Why are you doing this to me?
 -  What are you talking about?

743
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,400
(What's wrong, Kwang Soo?)

744
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,410
You called Seung Woo, didn't you?

745
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,570
- Me?
 -  Yes.

746
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,240
He is not coming out.

747
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,940
I am waiting for Yun Seok.

748
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,940
Just tell me. Have you talked to Seung Woo?

749
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,010
No. I swear, I haven't.

750
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,230
- You haven't?
 -  No.

751
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,100
(Is he really having stomach problems?)

752
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,610
I've been waiting outside for 30 minutes.

753
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,460
I've been waiting for 20 minutes, too. Did you call him?

754
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,660
(Did you set me up?)

755
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,490
- No. I didn't
 -  Okay, I'll talk to you later.

756
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,910
- Okay. See you.
 -  All right.

757
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,130
(Hey!)

758
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,140
(Who is it?)

759
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,810
(He is here!)

760
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,930
(Yoo Yun Seok became really famous after appearing in "Reply 1994".)

761
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,200
What if I am correct?

762
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,700
(His role as Chil Bong made him famous.)

763
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,970
(Yoo Yun Seok is here!)

764
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,310
(Give that to me.)

765
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,260
(He is caught talking to Kwang Soo on the phone.)

766
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,920
Give me a second.

767
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,810
Oh, Yun Seok. Nice to see you.

768
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,430
I'm so happy.

769
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,570
Yun Seok,

770
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,510
what took you so long?

771
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,840
I had to get dressed, but someone kept calling me.

772
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,960
I almost got tired of waiting.

773
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
It's so nice to see you.

774
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,510
I heard you were a student representative.

775
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,460
Yes, I was.

776
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,840
You are loved by so many viewers lately.

777
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,310
All right. Let me prepare the microphone first.

778
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,410
You know, Kwang Soo is...

779
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,110
- full of mischief.
 -  Yes.

780
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,360
Okay, Yun Seok.

781
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,600
(He was so eager to see Yun Seok.)

782
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,580
Please tell me...

783
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,810
one of your wishes.

784
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,110
Then I will grant that wish.

785
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,940
- A wish?
 -  Yes.

786
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,670
What should I request?

787
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,850
Think of a simple one. I could give you a piggyback ride.

788
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,430
- So you want a simple wish?
 -  Yes, something I can do right now.

789
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,300
(How about this?)

790
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,520
What? What is this?

791
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,920
(What is this thing?)

792
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,200
Hold on. Give me a second. I think he was prepared.

793
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,870
(Did Yun Seok know that Haha was coming?)

794
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,140
(Oh, my goodness!)

795
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,970
I think shaving will make a good mission.

796
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,910
- What?
 -  Shaving sounds good.

797
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,070
You can ask him to shave in 10 seconds.

798
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,170
- What?
 -  Make him shave in 10 seconds.

799
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,580
- Shaving in 10 seconds?
 -  This needs to work.

800
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,310
- Isn't that too rude?
 -  It's perfectly fine.

801
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,440
Calling you out this early in the morning is rude.

802
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,360
I do have an electric shaver...

803
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,670
Grab that.

804
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,870
Take that when you see him.

805
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,740
(He's in despair.)

806
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,860
My wish is...

807
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,350
You are asking me to shave my armpits, right?

808
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,240
No, not your armpits but here.

809
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,340
I can't stand this.

810
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,830
Hey, tell me the truth.

811
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,650
Tell me why you are doing this.

812
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,200
What is he?

813
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
(Even Haha seems so confused.)

814
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,370
Come on!

815
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,190
This is a penalty.

816
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,440
This is not a wish.

817
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,770
I'm sorry, but you're too rude.

818
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,520
Hold on. Yun Seok.

819
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,800
So...

820
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,770
you want me to shave, is that right?

821
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,560
(I'm sorry, but this is too hilarious.)

822
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,310
- So that is your wish?
 -  Yes.

823
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,110
I will count to 10.

824
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,370
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

825
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,040
Can you pick just one place for me to shave?

826
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,160
Then...

827
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,610
- please shave your chin.
 -  My chin?

828
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,600
(He suppresses his anger.)

829
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,750
All right.

830
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,830
How do I turn this on?

831
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,660
Okay. I'll turn it on for you.

832
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,170
(Yun Seok is so kind.)

833
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,960
- I'll count to 10.
 -  Okay.

834
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,100
Ready, start. Ten, nine,

835
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,130
eight, seven...

836
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,560
(I don't care!)

837
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,430
Four, three...

838
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,170
(His laughing makes him slow down.)

839
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,130
Two, one.

840
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,680
(Haha has finished shaving.)

841
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,130
I think you missed here.

842
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,260
(Yun Seok won't let a single hair be unshaved.)

843
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,340
Right here. Slowly, slowly...

844
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,180
You shouldn't miss a spot.

845
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,170
It's all clean now.

846
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,560
I didn't know Yun Seok was this harsh.

847
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
Are you sure you were a student representative?

848
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,930
You know, I am meticulous.

849
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,540
Oh, no, you are bleeding!

850
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,230
- What should I do?
 -  I was rushing.

851
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,560
It's okay. Bleeding this much for Running Man is normal.

852
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,830
- Oh, no, you are bleeding.
 -  I'm fine.

853
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,760
- Oh, no.
 -  It's okay, don't worry.

854
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,310
- It's done.
 -  I'm done, right? Thanks.

855
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,040
(He is fuming with anger.)

856
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,540
All right.

857
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,590
Wow, Yun Seok.

858
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,840
Please join us on Running Man. Promise me.

859
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,670
- Am I still bleeding?
 -  I am trying to stop it.

860
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,870
(I'm trying my best to stop it from bleeding.)

861
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,250
I was in a hurry because I had to shave in 10 seconds.

862
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,570
Just stamp on it already.

863
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,630
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't control myself.

864
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,800
- Am I supposed to vote?
 -  Yes.

865
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,520
- Stamp it.
 -  You know, on the election day,

866
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,930
my movie is coming out...

867
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,240
Just stamp it already!

868
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,610
Stamp it! Just stamp it!

869
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,170
(Haha successfully completes the mission and gets a stamp.)

870
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,930
Please join us on Running Man later.

871
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,600
- Okay.
 -  If you do...

872
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,500
Hold on, you're still bleeding.

873
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,470
(If he does, Haha will be able to have a match with him.)

874
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,000
(Kwang Soo is wandering around Seocho-gu for Yu Seung Woo.)

875
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,070
It'd be too rude to hurry him on our first encounter.

876
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,560
(Is he really that sick?)

877
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,910
I don't have much time.

878
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,730
I called him 30 minutes ago. He should've been prepared.

879
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,460
(Irritated)

880
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,690
(Loss for words)

881
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,670
(He calls him again.)

882
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,930
Hello, Kwang Soo.

883
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,180
(What?)

884
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,530
(Seung Woo is here at last.)

885
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,110
(How would this young and adorable singer look like?)

886
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Hello, Kwang Soo.

887
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,360
(Who are you?)

888
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,440
I am Seung Woo.

889
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,140
(Is he Seung Woo?)

890
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,200
(What happened to the young Seung Woo?)

891
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,930
(Seung Woo of SoulstaR)

892
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,370
(He is the lead vocalist.)

893
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,270
When was your first election?

894
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,570
It's been a while. I participated in the presidential election.

895
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,610
(He has voted for the presidential election.)

896
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,700
There is another election in April.

897
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,830
(He sounds very mature.)

898
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,460
(Was he born in 1997 or in 1977?)

899
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,840
I see.

900
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,160
Sorry, but how old are you?

901
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,730
I was born in 1981.

902
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,600
(He was born in 1981.)

903
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,700
I am so sorry.

904
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,280
(Sorry for bothering you.)

905
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,470
I received a call from Haha.

906
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,900
(Where is the 20-year-old Seung Woo that I was looking for?)

907
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,140
Were you surprised?

908
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,680
(Few hours ago)

909
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,810
Hello?

910
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,410
- Is this Seung Woo?
 -  Yes.

911
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,200
Hang up first. It's the right number. Hey!

912
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,700
(Kwang Soo ran off after hearing that it was "Seung Woo".)

913
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,810
- Seung Woo!
 -  Hey, are you a scammer?

914
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,180
Wow, that punk.

915
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,460
But I gave him a wrong number.

916
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,430
He's talking to Seung Woo, but it's not Yu Seung Woo.

917
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,010
(It's the wrong "Seung Woo".)

918
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,310
There was a group called SoulstaR.

919
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,760
He is Lee Seung Woo of SoulstaR.

920
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,510
Try calling. I knew he would run away like that.

921
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm so sick of him.

922
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,110
(Haha won this time.)

923
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,770
(He is stunned.)

924
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,470
I see...

925
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,560
Sorry for bothering you.

926
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,180
(He finally understands.)

927
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,730
What should I do now?

928
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,400
(It feels so awkward.)

929
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,640
Are you busy today?

930
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,270
No, I'm fine.

931
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,700
(He is not busy.)

932
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,060
I see. Can I go now?

933
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,540
Yeah, sure.

934
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,170
I'm so sorry.

935
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,500
(He doesn't even tell Kwang Soo to leave.)

936
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,630
- I'm sorry, but I have to go.
 -  That's okay. You are in a hurry.

937
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,440
I'll contact you later.

938
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,540
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

939
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,230
Goodbye.

940
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,700
(Awkward)

941
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,940
Haha tricked me.

942
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

943
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,460
(Kwang Soo is on his journey once again.)

944
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,800
- Bye.
 -  Thank you.

945
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,370
(Thank you, Seung Woo of SoulstaR for helping us.)

946
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,900
(He is so angry.)

947
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,600
(Kwang Soo has one word to say.)

948
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,800
Hey, Kwang Soo.

949
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,900
You.

950
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,360
(He said, "You".)

951
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
Hey, where are you?

952
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,230
(He wants to know where Haha is.)

953
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,360
Answer me!

954
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,540
(He is really angry.)

955
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,600
- Why?
 -  Come here.

956
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,060
- Why?
 -  Come here. Where are you?

957
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,170
Where are you now?

958
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,430
(Kwang Soo has lost this match.)

959
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,460
- Where are you?
 -  Why?

960
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,530
Why? What happened?

961
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,700
Who was that old man?

962
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,810
(He wants to know who that old man was.)

963
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,800
- Hey...
 -  How could you do this to me?

964
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,200
- He's Seung Woo.
 -  Why are you doing this?

965
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,360
He's Seung woo.

966
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,510
- Why are you doing this to me?
 -  What do you mean?

967
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,110
You saw the name on my phone.

968
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,690
But why did he say, "Yes," when I asked, "Seung Woo?"

969
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,040
His name is Seung Woo. Lee Seung Woo.

970
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,270
- Okay. I get it.
 -  What did you get?

971
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,530
No, it's nothing. I'll call you later.

972
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,830
(I'll see you in the next round.)

973
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,910
I'll call you later. I have to do my mission now.

974
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,100
This is a bit much.

975
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,330
(Grant a wish of a celebrity who has the same name as an area.)

976
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,680
I'll say this is photoshopped.

977
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,680
I think she is here now.

978
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,670
There she is.

979
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,740
(Who is he going to meet?)

980
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,910
I'm sorry, Seohyun.

981
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm so sorry. I should cover this.

982
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,770
(It's Seohyun from Girls' Generation.)

983
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,730
(Her name is exactly the same as Seohyun-dong.)

984
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,330
I have to grant a wish of a celebrity to get a stamp.

985
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,010
- I see, a wish...
 -  Yes, a simple one is fine.

986
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,960
- A simple one?
 -  Yes.

987
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,270
- Simple enough for you to grant?
 -  That's right.

988
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,840
You know, the weather is really nice these days.

989
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,510
I wish someone...

990
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,850
could carry me on his back...

991
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,510
or give me a ride on his shoulders.

992
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,110
I'd like to go on a walk like that.

993
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,060
- Well..
 -  That sounds simple.

994
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,210
Don't worry, I can do that for you any time.

995
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,670
- Okay, I am ready.
 -  Get on!

996
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,830
- One, two, three!
 -  One, two, three!

997
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,960
- All right.
 -  There you go.

998
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,030
(She hops on.)

999
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,470
- Am I heavy?
 -  No, you are not.

1000
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,230
You are not heavy at all.

1001
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,640
(He indirectly brags about his strength.)

1002
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,740
- This is so fun.
 -  Really?

1003
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,230
- You're not heavy at all.
 -  I'm sorry, I'm heavy.

1004
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,170
- I must be heavy.
 -  No!

1005
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,640
- I'm not?
 -  You're as light as feather.

1006
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,720
I never knew you were going to be this light.

1007
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,960
- You are so funny.
 -  Yes.

1008
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,240
- It's unbelievable.
 -  Wow!

1009
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,910
- Should we get some coffee?
 -  What?

1010
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,140
- I will buy it for you.
 -  Oh my gosh...

1011
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,440
- Are you really okay?
 -  Of course I am.

1012
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,110
- I think I am a little embarrassed.
 -  Right? Hello.

1013
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,000
- What do you want?
 -  Iced Americano.

1014
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,610
Iced Americano, please.

1015
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,510
- It's 9.80 dollars.
 -  Okay.

1016
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,310
Wait. No.

1017
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,640
- Don't be sorry. Thank you.
 -  This is so funny.

1018
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,760
You can't put me down, can you?

1019
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,860
- I can't.
 -  Right?

1020
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,600
- Here you go.
 -  Oh dear.

1021
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,290
Thank you.

1022
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,030
I think it's too hard for you.

1023
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,300
- No, I am okay.
 -  But...

1024
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,310
I am okay, Seohyun.

1025
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,000
I am really okay.

1026
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,860
- I'm okay.
 -  This is so embarrassing.

1027
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,000
It's embarrassing, right?

1028
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,700
But you asked for it.

1029
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,510
- This is crazy.
 -  This is indeed crazy.

1030
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,770
- Oh gosh...
 -  Hello!

1031
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,830
(They are enjoying the coffee while on a mission.)

1032
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,360
I didn't know it was this hot today.

1033
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,870
(The weather is so good today.)

1034
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,500
It's such a lovely weather.

1035
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,670
(Jong Kook successfully completes the mission and gets a stamp.)

1036
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,560
- Where should I put it?
 -  Just put it here.

1037
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,640
- Do I put it on your palm?
 -  Yes.

1038
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,530
- R. In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

1039
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,760
Push.

1040
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,180
Okay!

1041
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,420
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1042
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,540
(He will now go to the next mission place, Gimpo.)

1043
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,340
(There you go.)

1044
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,040
Yes.

1045
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,100
Hello?

1046
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,370
Hello.

1047
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,410
Hello, Bo Gum!

1048
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,300
Hello, Ji Hyo.

1049
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,700
(She's thrilled.)

1050
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,530
- I admire you.
 -  Don't mention that.

1051
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,680
I really wanted to meet you, Bo Gum.

1052
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,570
Me too. I always watch Running Man.

1053
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,870
And I heard you really like me.

1054
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,240
- Yes. I know.
 -  Yes. I'm sure you were joking.

1055
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,670
- No, I did talk about you.
 -  Right.

1056
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,770
And I finally get to meet you.

1057
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,640
- I know.
 -  Gosh...

1058
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,680
The power of talking is amazing.

1059
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,860
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1060
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,300
- Bo Gum.
 -  No problem. Yes?

1061
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,370
I have a mission today.

1062
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,410
Yes. What's the mission?

1063
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,600
I have to meet a celebrity who is 12 years younger than me...

1064
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,560
- and grant his wish.
 -  I see.

1065
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,640
I have to grant you one wish and get a stamp.

1066
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,010
If you have time now,

1067
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,640
I will grant you a wish. Can you give me a stamp?

1068
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,800
- Right now?
 -  Yes.

1069
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,230
If you are outside,

1070
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,310
I can go there.

1071
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,530
(Will the hottest celebrity Park Bo Gum...)

1072
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,000
(respond to the spontaneous request?)

1073
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,310
No, I will go there.

1074
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,720
(He accepts the request.)

1075
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,500
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1076
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,940
Where are you?

1077
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,760
I am near the Independence Gate.

1078
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Where?

1079
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,370
I'm near the Independence Gate.

1080
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,430
We are fated to meet. I am near. I am in Jongno.

1081
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,000
We are fated to meet, Bo Gum.

1082
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I have a photo shoot today in Jongno.

1083
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,660
- Is that right?
 -  Yes.

1084
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,670
We are fated to meet today.

1085
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,500
- Bo Gum.
 -  Yes.

1086
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,840
Have you already got to the Independence Gate?

1087
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,440
Where are you now?

1088
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,270
I'm near Korean Contemporary History Museum.

1089
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,860
I will go to Sejong Centre Chamber Hall.

1090
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,630
- You will?
 -  Yes.

1091
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,930
You are so sweet.

1092
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,670
Okay. I will be waiting for you here then.

1093
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,030
- Okay. I will hurry up.
 -  Thank you.

1094
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,030
- Thank you, too.
 -  Thank you.

1095
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,940
- See you soon. Okay.
 -  See you soon. Okay.

1096
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,870
Yes!

1097
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,070
I have to go meet Bo Gum.

1098
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,030
Let's go meet Bo Gum!

1099
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,040
(She's meeting him at Korean Contemporary History Museum.)

1100
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,400
(She arrives at the meeting place.)

1101
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,840
(She puts down two cups of coffee on the bench.)

1102
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,510
(And she fixes her makeup.)

1103
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,570
(She fixes her makeup with delicate touches.)

1104
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,100
(She hopes he will arrive before the coffee gets cold.)

1105
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,430
(I am...)

1106
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,790
(coming to meet you.)

1107
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,600
- Hello.
 -  Oh gosh!

1108
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,930
(He surprised her.)

1109
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,960
It's Bo Gum! It's you!

1110
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

1111
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,140
Bo Gum is really here.

1112
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,070
It's me, Taek.

1113
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,270
(The hottest actor Park Bo Gum accidentally comes to Running Man.)

1114
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,000
- Here's your coffee.
 -  Oh, yes.

1115
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,900
- I got hot coffee for you.
 -  Thank you.

1116
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,310
- Thank you.
 -  Oh dear.

1117
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:31,960
- Bo Gum.
 -  Yes.

1118
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,070
- Today, I will grant you a wish.
 -  Okay.

1119
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,640
- And you will give me a stamp.
 -  Okay.

1120
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,840
Did you think about your wish?

1121
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,510
- Yes.
 -  You have one?

1122
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,110
I am a little scared because he said yes so confidently.

1123
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,830
(Is he naive or evil? What is his wish?)

1124
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,300
I want to take a photo with you and get your autograph.

1125
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,010
(He wants a picture with her and her autograph.)

1126
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,430
No way!

1127
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,760
It's okay. That's okay, right? I love it.

1128
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,770
No way.

1129
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,610
I'd love that of course.

1130
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,140
I'd be happy.

1131
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,670
(They take a photo together right away.)

1132
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,970
I want to cover my face.

1133
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,070
(Our smiles look alike.)

1134
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,240
In 1, 2, 3.

1135
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,540
(The couple with 12 years of age difference)

1136
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,730
- Bo Gum.
 -  Yes.

1137
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,510
- Please write "Dear Ji Hyo".
 -  Sure. Okay.

1138
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,270
Doesn't it look like he's granting my wish?

1139
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,610
(Careful)

1140
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,570
(It seems like Ji Hyo gave up becoming a leader.)

1141
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,460
- Oh gosh!
 -  Thank you.

1142
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,840
Please give me an autograph, too.

1143
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,220
Oh my gosh.

1144
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,360
I got Bo Gum's autograph.

1145
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,670
- I...
 -  I can't believe this.

1146
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,800
- Thank you. Yes.
 -  Bo Gum.

1147
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,700
- I will grant your wish now.
 -  Okay.

1148
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,140
(She gives Bo Gum her autograph, too.)

1149
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,700
- I wrote too much.
 -  Do you...

1150
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,300
Do you have to meet another person?

1151
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,140
No, I just have to meet you.

1152
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,270
- I'm done after I meet you.
 -  Oh gosh.

1153
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,970
- Thank you.
 -  From the start,

1154
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,300
- I only talked about you.
 -  Really?

1155
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,460
Thank you so much.

1156
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,770
- Don't mention it.
 -  No.

1157
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,530
- Bo Gum, thanks for coming.
 -  No problem.

1158
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,640
- Thank you so much.
 -  I never knew...

1159
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,810
you'd come in the middle of your work.

1160
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,300
(Hugging)

1161
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,130
- You could've asked for more.
 -  No.

1162
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,460
Please invite me to Running Man later.

1163
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,330
I hope you will get to...

1164
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,310
- join us later.
 -  Me, too.

1165
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,460
I hope you will win today.

1166
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,000
- Have a great day.
 -  Thank you.

1167
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,500
- Thank you.
 -  I will be able to win today.

1168
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,410
- Okay. I will watch the show.
 -  Bye.

1169
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,040
- Thank you.
 -  Gosh...

1170
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,060
- Thank you so much.
 -  No problem.

1171
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,400
- Thank you, Bo Gum.
 -  Thanks for the coffee.

1172
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,800
- Thank you.
 -  No problem.

1173
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,140
(Ji Hyo successfully completes her mission and gets the stamp.)

1174
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,410
(6 members completed the mission.)

1175
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,170
- Eun Ji.
 -  Why?

1176
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,240
What do you mean why?

1177
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,310
I am shooting Running Man right now.

1178
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,800
Oh, okay.

1179
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,030
- Eun Ji. By any chance...
 -  Yes.

1180
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,130
Yes.

1181
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,670
Ha Young didn't vote yet, right?

1182
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,510
- She didn't do it yet.
 -  Right?

1183
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,170
Are you with her right now?

1184
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:21,900
(Ha Young went...)

1185
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,030
She went to do groceries?

1186
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,310
She went to the jungle.

1187
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,800
- Where?
 -  A jungle.

1188
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,010
Oh, a jungle! Right. She went to the jungle.

1189
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,630
(He fails to meet Ha Young.)

1190
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,930
He's taking a class in school.

1191
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,360
- He's taking a class.
 -  Yes.

1192
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,500
(He fails again.)

1193
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,930
It can't be someone born in 1987?

1194
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,100
I can't meet someone who was born in 1987.

1195
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,560
I know a lot of people who were born in 1987.

1196
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,800
I am sorry.

1197
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
(Fooled by Haha, Kwang Soo is still lost.)

1198
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,860
(The other members are headed to the next destination.)

1199
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,940
Sir.

1200
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,740
Sir, can you drive a little faster?

1201
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,840
I need to beat the car in front of us.

1202
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,340
I can get there faster, right?

1203
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,370
It wouldn't have been easy for them.

1204
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,130
What's this?

1205
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,370
(Who will become the candidates?)

1206
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,810
(The Leader Election House in Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province)

1207
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,800
(Who will leave the first footprints here?)

1208
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,870
Congratulations.

1209
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,630
(Look!)

1210
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,760
(It's Gary!)

1211
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,240
Am I the first?

1212
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,810
- You are the first.
 -  Oh my gosh!

1213
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,810
You've earned the right to run for the election.

1214
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,070
Thank you so much.

1215
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,540
Where did everyone go?

1216
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,360
(Who will take the last place?)

1217
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,300
(Yu Jae Seok)

1218
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,410
You are the second candidate.

1219
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,060
Okay.

1220
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,110
(Jae Seok is the No. 2 candidate of the Leader Election!)

1221
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,070
(Candidate No. 2 Jae Seok)

1222
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,410
I am the second one.

1223
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,770
I'm the second, aren't I?

1224
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,760
I'm not!

1225
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,260
Gary got here first?

1226
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,970
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook and Haha shortly arrive.)

1227
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,810
The situation is over.

1228
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,700
The two candidates have already been decided.

1229
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,540
Unfortunately, you don't have the right to run for the election.

1230
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,330
(Sighing)

1231
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,640
I don't have the right?

1232
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,700
On the first election, you don't have the right.

1233
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,000
(He becomes the voter.)

1234
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,540
I can just give up and go there?

1235
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,660
It's not giving up. You never had the chance.

1236
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,960
(He never had the chance.)

1237
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,530
(I went through all the humiliation...)

1238
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,700
(because of Haha.)

1239
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,070
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

1240
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,980
(I won't forgive you, Haha.)

1241
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,060
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

1242
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,430
(He walks angrily.)

1243
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,840
- What is it?
 -  What's wrong?

1244
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,980
What? What?

1245
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,210
What's wrong?

1246
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,010
Why? What's wrong?

1247
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,990
Wait. I am...

1248
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,100
What's the matter?

1249
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,030
- What wrong with him?
 -  I'm just...

1250
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,900
Let's talk later.

1251
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,100
- Take off your glasses.
 -  Calm down.

1252
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,060
- Be careful.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1253
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,140
(Everyone including Kwang Soo is here.)

1254
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,630
- I'm worried.
 -  The two first-comers,

1255
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,360
Jae Seok and Gary, will be the candidates.

1256
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,430
I see.

1257
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,250
Tell us what you're going to do.

1258
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,600
- Tell us what you're going to do...
 -  Tell us.

1259
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,800
if you become the leader.

1260
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,820
- As I said earlier,
 -  Yes.

1261
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,900
I'm not a mean person.

1262
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,560
- That's right.
 -  Gary is not mean.

1263
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,830
- That's true.
 -  I'm not mean.

1264
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,250
- I won't bother you so much.
 -  Of course not.

1265
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,400
- Jae Seok can be very mean.
 -  I know.

1266
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,170
- He's so mischievous.
 -  I might be mischievous...

1267
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,100
- but I won't give you a hard time.
 -  I don't believe you.

1268
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,360
- It'll be fun.
 -  You know him.

1269
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,500
(I don't want to think about it.)

1270
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,260
Don't you want to have fun for an hour?

1271
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,800
- I can make it fun.
 -  Even while having fun,

1272
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,260
- he can give you a hard time.
 -  That's right.

1273
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,800
- Gary is persuasive.
 -  He is.

1274
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,130
- I lean towards Gary.
 -  Gary would be better.

1275
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,770
Even if we want Gary to win,

1276
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,600
we shouldn't be unanimous.

1277
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,110
- You're right.
 -  We should never be unanimous.

1278
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,710
You'll select your leader by majority.

1279
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,900
The leader will have power over the other members...

1280
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,900
- for one hour.
 -  Really?

1281
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,010
But if you're unanimous, there will be bad consequences.

1282
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,400
If you're unanimous, the staff will be your leader.

1283
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,030
(The producer's wish list)

1284
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,800
We shouldn't talk to each other. Kwang Soo, go ahead.

1285
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,260
- We shouldn't talk.
 -  Haha, go ahead.

1286
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,650
It's unpredictable.

1287
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,660
Don't talk to each other.

1288
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,760
It's hard to predict what will happen.

1289
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,610
- As long as we're not unanimous...
 -  It won't be unanimous.

1290
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,280
- Let me count the votes.
 -  Okay.

1291
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,100
- Who will win?
 -  Congratulations in advance.

1292
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,040
- It'd be 3 to 2.
 -  I'll be on his side.

1293
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,940
I hope it'll be 3 to 2. We shouldn't be unanimous.

1294
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,130
- It says Gary.
 -  It's Haha's ballot.

1295
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,970
It's Haha's ballot.

1296
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,740
"I love you. Let's go home together."

1297
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,140
(I love you, Gary.)

1298
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,360
(Heart)

1299
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,810
- He can be very sweet sometimes.
 -  What do you like about him?

1300
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,030
(What says the second ballot?)

1301
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,800
- It's Gary.
 -  Gary.

1302
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,540
It's Ji Hyo's ballot.

1303
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,560
- I voted for you, Gary.
 -  Will the result be reversed?

1304
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,360
- Ji Hyo.
 -  Ji Hyo voted for Gary.

1305
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,300
Ji Hyo, how can you do this?

1306
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,510
We're in trouble.

1307
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,200
- Yu Jae Seok.
 -  It's Jae Seok.

1308
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,760
(Jae Seok won one vote.)

1309
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,560
- I voted for you.
 -  He sided with him.

1310
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,130
I saved you from the penalty.

1311
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,300
That's right. You did well.

1312
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,110
- Right?
 -  We won't be penalised.

1313
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,100
You shouldn't be in the minority.

1314
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,440
(Who will be the leader and who will be in the minority?)

1315
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,000
- Gary.
 -  Whose ballot is it?

1316
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,540
- It's Jong Kook's.
 -  We could have been unanimous.

1317
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,010
If it wasn't for Seok Jin, we would've been unanimous.

1318
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,860
- Gary gained a majority.
 -  We have only one ballot left.

1319
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,910
You already gained a majority.

1320
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,510
Gary.

1321
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,000
- If it wasn't for me...
 -  I can't believe this.

1322
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,910
If it wasn't for me, you would have been penalised.

1323
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,900
Thank you for supporting me.

1324
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,820
- Congratulations.
 -  By the way...

1325
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,130
- Thank you, Seok Jin.
 -  What would you have done...

1326
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,000
- without me?
 -  I know. Thank you.

1327
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,660
- I'm disappointed in you, Seok Jin.
 -  Thank you.

1328
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,370
(What penalty will Seok Jin receive?)

1329
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,610
You can style his hair with them.

1330
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,950
What should we do?

1331
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,240
Let me see.

1332
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,630
- You should put it closer.
 -  That's too much.

1333
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:42,980
(Shocked)

1334
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,060
Cover your forehead.

1335
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,500
(Spraying)

1336
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,640
The colour is quite vivid.

1337
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,460
- Wait.
 -  Cover your forehead.

1338
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,030
(My goodness.)

1339
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,130
It's too much.

1340
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,700
- Is it the colour of grass?
 -  Yes.

1341
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,670
It makes me want to play golf on your head.

1342
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,100
Don't spray on my ear!

1343
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,610
(Jae Seok finishes it off by adding some pink.)

1344
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,860
- Stop!
 -  It seems done.

1345
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,140
You look like a member of a motorcycle gang.

1346
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,930
I like the colour combination.

1347
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,730
- It's perfect.
 -  Let me see.

1348
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,810
You'll be surprised.

1349
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,080
- Do you like it?
 -  It doesn't look bad.

1350
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,240
I look like a gangster.

1351
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,310
Gosh, I hate it.

1352
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,360
I want to look intelligent.

1353
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,300
- You remind me...
 -  What is this?

1354
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,660
You remind me of the World Cup season.

1355
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,800
I mean...

1356
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,100
- It's a festival.
 -  Go, Korea!

1357
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,560
(Go, Korea!)

1358
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,110
- Go, Korea!
 -  Go, Korea!

1359
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,170
Gosh.

1360
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,200
You're very quiet.

1361
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,310
Someone who turned on TV now will think...

1362
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,710
- I intended to look like this.
 -  That's right.

1363
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,560
This is embarrassing.

1364
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,440
I would like Seok Jin...

1365
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,660
and Jae Seok to go grocery shopping.

1366
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,760
He's good.

1367
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,010
- He's so good.
 -  He's great.

1368
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,360
- Is this what power means?
 -  He can do whatever he wants.

1369
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,040
- That's not it.
 -  This is embarrassing.

1370
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,830
Leader, what would you like to eat?

1371
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,870
- I'd like some braised chicken.
 -  Braised chicken?

1372
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,300
- See you in a while.
 -  Anyone else?

1373
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,660
- Does anyone want anything?
 -  I'm so embarrassed.

1374
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,390
I'd like some refreshments, too.

1375
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,100
- Refreshments?
 -  That sounds great.

1376
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,200
- Yes.
 -  We need them.

1377
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,900
I'd like some chocolate for desserts.

1378
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,030
- I want chocolate.
 -  Chocolate.

1379
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,600
I want ice cream.

1380
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,750
My goodness.

1381
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:19,700
Guys, we will try to prepare them. You can wait inside.

1382
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,340
(Let's see what happens in the next election.)

1383
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,400
(The first era, the Age of Gary)

1384
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,910
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes.

1385
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,260
- Never mind.
 -  What were you going to say?

1386
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,130
To be honest...

1387
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,630
Answer me.

1388
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,010
If you're not given a badge,

1389
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,890
you said you will choose Gary to be penalised with, right?

1390
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,510
- I did.
 -  Right?

1391
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,240
If you don't give me the badge, I'm going to take you with me.

1392
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,100
- What?
 -  I'm serious.

1393
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,640
- What?
 -  If he doesn't give me the badge,

1394
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,900
I'm going to take him with me when I'm penalised.

1395
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,110
You know I can take one person, right?

1396
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,100
Gosh. You should be careful who you trust.

1397
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,760
Don't say that.

1398
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,400
Think about it.

1399
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,900
- I'm so tired.
 -  You might sleep in the cemetery.

1400
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,340
I'm going to take him if he doesn't give me the badge.

1401
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,540
I mean it. I've made up my mind.

1402
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,300
- Really?
 -  Seriously?

1403
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,460
He's so...

1404
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,570
Get out.

1405
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,460
- He wants you to get out.
 -  Get out.

1406
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,560
- You want me to get out?
 -  Wait.

1407
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,310
Meet me at the cemetery, then.

1408
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,360
You'll meet him there.

1409
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,300
- I'm so stressed.
 -  Meet me there.

1410
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,630
If you don't give me the badge, I have no chance.

1411
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,100
You look so mean now.

1412
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,550
I betray you all the time.

1413
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,500
If you don't give me the badge, I'll take you to the cemetery.

1414
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,100
(An evil threat to Gary's regime)

1415
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,730
Seriously.

1416
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:31,570
- He's unbelievable.
 -  Really.

1417
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,000
I don't think I'll be the leader.

1418
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,930
- I have a lot of enemies.
 -  I think I have a chance.

1419
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,030
- You have a chance.
 -  That's right.

1420
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,100
In the next election, I'll help you.

1421
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,070
- All right.
 -  Give me a Go-Home Badge.

1422
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,000
- I will.
 -  All right.

1423
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,860
- Okay?
 -  Let's go home together.

1424
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,260
Say "Yu".

1425
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,210
- Yu...
 -  And Ji, go!

1426
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,730
Let's maintain our trust.

1427
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,560
- Let's maintain our friendship.
 -  Let's maintain our promise.

1428
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,770
Kwang Soo, I'm afraid you might get me in trouble.

1429
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,710
I think you should be beaten up first.

1430
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,500
What?

1431
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,000
Are you going to beat me up?

1432
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,930
I saw boxing gloves.

1433
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,200
- Is he going to beat me up?
 -  Should I help?

1434
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,000
I'd like to see Jong Kook...

1435
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,300
- Jong Kook?
 -  and Kwang Soo spar.

1436
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,240
- That'll be interesting.
 -  That'll be fun.

1437
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,400
- I agree.
 -  Look.

1438
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,200
Who knows who will win?

1439
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,790
- Don't worry too much.
 -  Wait.

1440
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,010
Did you take what I said seriously?

1441
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,030
(He's shameless.)

1442
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,200
Bring the gears.

1443
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,500
- Leader.
 -  I'll go get them.

1444
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,630
- I was joking.
 -  Be a man.

1445
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,000
Bring the gears first.

1446
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,130
- Bring the headgears.
 -  Leader, I was joking.

1447
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,830
- Don't be like that.
 -  It'll be fun.

1448
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,440
Why don't you make Kwang Soo write a note?

1449
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,930
- A note?
 -  What note?

1450
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,040
- It depends on what he writes.
 -  That you won't take me with you.

1451
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,400
That you won't take me to the cemetery.

1452
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,840
You have to write it yourself.

1453
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,200
- We have cameras here, too.
 -  What is this?

1454
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,210
Guys.

1455
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,240
You should be the witnesses.

1456
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,360
- Write it.
 -  Oh, they're ready.

1457
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,000
- What are these?
 -  Write the note first.

1458
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,730
Why do we need a hammer? Are we in the movie, "The Chaser"?

1459
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:00,510
I'll put them in front of Jong Kook for now.

1460
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,560
- First...
 -  I'll write it.

1461
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,670
Write the note first.

1462
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,340
(Jong Kook is getting ready to discipline Kwang Soo)

1463
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,900
- Look at Jong Kook.
 -  Wait.

1464
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,600
- Write the note first.
 -  Let him write it first.

1465
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,200
- Okay.
 -  I'll write it.

1466
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,630
- Write the title.
 -  Okay.

1467
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,400
- Write your name.
 -  I was joking.

1468
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,900
- Write "Lee Kwang Soo".
 -  Lee Kwang Soo.

1469
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,440
- Even if...
 -  "Even if..."

1470
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,340
You're not given a badge...

1471
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,710
"I am not given a badge..."

1472
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,810
You won't choose me to be penalised with you.

1473
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,870
- Okay. If I break this promise?
 -  If you break this promise,

1474
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,770
your ex-girlfriends...

1475
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,280
What?

1476
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,500
(What?)

1477
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,800
Why?

1478
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,100
Pick something else.

1479
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,800
They will be revealed through Gary's social media account...

1480
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,310
- one by one.
 -  That sounds great.

1481
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,700
- My ex-girlfriends?
 -  Yes.

1482
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,010
I'm really going to do that.

1483
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,700
I have nothing to lose.

1484
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,170
I've been working for 20 years.

1485
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,900
- Kwang Soo looks really worried.
 -  We need a set rule.

1486
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,560
- Will that be strong enough?
 -  It will be.

1487
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,420
- It's strong enough.
 -  It is strong.

1488
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,390
I've made so many wrong moves today.

1489
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,640
You're so smart.

1490
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,930
(Kwang Soo's first revolt is now settled down.)

1491
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,110
Be nice.

1492
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,510
Okay.

1493
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,570
They're taking a rest.

1494
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,540
Those brats.

1495
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,240
They should help us.

1496
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,870
- You're back.
 -  You're back.

1497
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,560
- What are you doing?
 -  Welcome back.

1498
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,030
We've been sitting here.

1499
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,310
- The weird thing is...
 -  Set the table.

1500
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,670
Set the table.

1501
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,310
I don't even have to talk to them.

1502
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,840
- You're not the leader.
 -  Set the table.

1503
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,740
I'm his right-hand man. Set the table.

1504
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,730
- Set the table.
 -  Why is it that...

1505
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,350
you're acting like a leader?

1506
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,730
It's my role.

1507
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,810
- I gave him the right.
 -  Come this way.

1508
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,300
- Gary.
 -  I'll do it.

1509
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,930
Strawberries are my favourite. Who decided to buy them?

1510
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,900
- I did.
 -  It was me.

1511
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,400
(Please remember me.)

1512
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,830
He didn't want to but I insisted on buying them.

1513
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,280
- I'll remember that.
 -  It was me.

1514
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,870
It's my favourite fruit.

1515
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,000
Why don't you go wash the fruits?

1516
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,360
All right.

1517
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,830
(Kwang Soo volunteered to wash the fruits.)

1518
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,130
They look great.

1519
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,180
- That's right.
 -  They look delicious.

1520
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,310
I washed the strawberries.

1521
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,300
You should have removed the stems as well.

1522
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,660
(You should have removed the stems as well.)

1523
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,100
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Gosh.

1524
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,260
He doesn't know a thing.

1525
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,460
It's healthier this way.

1526
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,630
It's hard to grab.

1527
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,470
- There's a knife. Cut them off.
 -  Use the knife.

1528
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,660
We could use all of them.

1529
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,240
You're right. We could have some more.

1530
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,360
It's already boiling.

1531
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,280
Leader, I removed the stems.

1532
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,360
You did?

1533
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,410
I did remove the stems.

1534
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,660
- Is there another table?
 -  That's driving me crazy.

1535
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,730
Why?

1536
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,470
- You must feel uncomfortable.
 -  Is this how it usually is?

1537
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,230
- Is it? To eat at the same table?
 -  The king needs to eat first.

1538
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,000
I saw another table inside.

1539
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,440
I think it's a good idea to eat on the floor.

1540
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,760
Excuse me. Kwang Soo and I...

1541
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,530
- Me too?
 -  Yes.

1542
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,140
- Leader, me too?
 -  Isn't that obvious?

1543
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,000
I keep on being moved to the edge.

1544
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,700
- Oh, my.
 -  I will move.

1545
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,060
I keep on sitting at the edge.

1546
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,480
I think it'll be all right for everyone to sit down and eat.

1547
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,870
Is that right? Since we're not eating at the same table?

1548
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,610
- My legs.
 -  This is annoying.

1549
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,600
I'll fight for independence.

1550
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,830
(It's sweet to be a king.)

1551
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,310
I don't want to live as the subordinate.

1552
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:17,310
(Gary's tenure comes to an end.)

1553
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,370
- What is this?
 -  Should we go outside?

1554
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,400
- I think there's something outside.
 -  Is it outside?

1555
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,200
There must be something out there.

1556
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
- Being a king is difficult.
 -  You must know.

1557
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,830
- How long did you last?
 -  It's not easy.

1558
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,040
- I had to write a note.
 -  Do we need to take this off?

1559
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,410
Being a leader is very burdening.

1560
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:36,970
I received all kinds of threats and plots against me.

1561
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,160
- I really can't stand it.
 -  It's true.

1562
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,410
If I had to do it again, I will forsake my rights.

1563
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,900
- All kinds of threats.
 -  What should we do now?

1564
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,530
The next mission to elect the second leader will be fishing.

1565
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,570
- Please.
 -  What is it?

1566
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,760
We will move to a fishing place in a moment.

1567
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,000
- Yes.
 -  A fishing place?

1568
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,400
Each of you will begin fishing.

1569
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,510
I'm really bad at fishing.

1570
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,630
- Is this a test of luck?
 -  But...

1571
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,760
this is a good mission.

1572
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,400
- What are you talking about?
 -  Last time,

1573
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,530
you caught a fish once.

1574
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,330
Not with my bare hands but with a fishing rod.

1575
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,500
- With a fishing rod.
 -  A fishing rod?

1576
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,840
- I can't.
 -  It's difficult.

1577
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,760
- Fishing is really difficult.
 -  Isn't fishing a great idea?

1578
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,110
I can see the fish moving in the water.

1579
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,840
I have a good feeling about this.

1580
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,160
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes.

1581
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,090
- You won't have the feeling.
 -  Is that where Joong Ki comes in?

1582
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,330
- Who's good at fishing?
 -  Can we sit anywhere we want?

1583
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,670
- Can we sit anywhere?
 -  Gary.

1584
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,360
Do you know how to fasten a float?

1585
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,900
- It's over here.
 -  I do.

1586
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,540
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

1587
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,870
Remember that you'll get tired if you sit next to a loud person.

1588
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,210
- This is the place.
 -  I'm going to catch one.

1589
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,170
- Now.
 -  Is this right?

1590
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,660
A worm is the best.

1591
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,570
- I'm sorry.
 -  How much time are we given?

1592
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,400
The time ends as soon as two people catch a fish.

1593
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,460
Two fish?

1594
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,170
Let's go for it.

1595
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,330
- I don't know.
 -  Did you catch one?

1596
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,910
(Seven Anglers begin fishing.)

1597
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,600
Please give me a chance to win.

1598
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,030
I should wait laid back.

1599
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,580
- Please.
 -  Please.

1600
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,090
- Please.
 -  Please send me one fish.

1601
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,710
I think it's moving.

1602
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,170
Have we ever caught anything? Weren't we the one being caught?

1603
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,930
Goodness, he's so talkative.

1604
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,060
You three, please be quiet.

1605
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,140
- Us three?
 -  What did you say?

1606
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,960
What did you say?

1607
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,660
- Goodness me.
 -  Goodness me.

1608
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,530
I would have taught you a lesson if you were next to me.

1609
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,640
Shall I move?

1610
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,540
No, stay there.

1611
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,070
- Is it even possible to catch one?
 -  Please, come to me.

1612
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,510
It's coming.

1613
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,060
It's better to get caught by me.

1614
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,010
- Is he talking to the fish?
 -  Or else your pride will be hurt.

1615
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,460
If you're going to get caught, it's better to get caught by me.

1616
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,030
My goodness. The float.

1617
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,530
It's better to get caught by me.

1618
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,330
(I had a feeling.)

1619
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,340
- The float was moving.
 -  What was that?

1620
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,780
- I was surprised.
 -  What was that?

1621
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,140
Were you exercising your arm?

1622
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,040
Usually, fishing at fish farms...

1623
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,670
(The float definitely moved.)

1624
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,740
Usually, fishing at fish farms...

1625
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,910
Oh, yes!

1626
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,220
Oh, yes!

1627
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,270
- My goodness.
 -  Did you catch it?

1628
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,090
- Really?
 -  Yes!

1629
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,570
What's that?

1630
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,560
(He catches one as soon as they begin.)

1631
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,610
- What is that?
 -  He's got it.

1632
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,540
- Look.
 -  What is this? It's so big.

1633
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,340
Why is it so big?

1634
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,800
It's so big. How should I catch this?

1635
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,270
- I'm in a hurry.
 -  Excuse me.

1636
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:17,560
- There's only one place left.
 -  Help me out.

1637
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,100
- Please let it go back in.
 -  There's one place left.

1638
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,560
- Please.
 -  Please.

1639
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,660
(If he loses grip of it now, it will all come to nothing.)

1640
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,330
(Haha versus Big Fish, who will be the winner?)

1641
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,440
Please.

1642
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,510
- Haha can't win.
 -  Really. Haha can't win.

1643
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,440
(Haha wins.)

1644
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,770
- You're all dead meat.
 -  We're in trouble.

1645
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,630
I'm in trouble, there's only one spot left.

1646
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,580
- There's only one spot left.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1647
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,740
Haha, when did you pull it out?

1648
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,540
The float went right under.

1649
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,140
I got it out.

1650
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,380
I did it by myself.

1651
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,040
- He can't be the winner.
 -  It's really big.

1652
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,140
How did he do that?

1653
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,340
(Everyone, follow me.)

1654
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,570
Excuse me, do you need anything?

1655
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,530
Haha is really awesome.

1656
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,810
Haha has always been awesome.

1657
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,370
(Everyone is already taking Haha's side.)

1658
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,610
It ate my bait.

1659
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,910
Do I just do this?

1660
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,070
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes, Jae Seok.

1661
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,610
Where's your fish mask?

1662
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,560
Can I catch you?

1663
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,970
- Jae Seok.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1664
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,460
Please let me catch you once.

1665
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,740
- I'll help you out.
 -  I can't go in the water.

1666
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,900
- Look there.
 -  Kwang Soo, this is just too much.

1667
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,940
Will I catch one?

1668
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,490
(Barking)

1669
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,640
Be quiet.

1670
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:30,670
- Be quiet.
 -  You little dog.

1671
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,340
Hey, you.

1672
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,870
- Go away.
 -  Be quiet.

1673
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,460
Stop pretending to be a big dog when you're so little.

1674
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,540
Get out.

1675
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,460
- Kwang Soo, there aren't any fish.
 -  I don't think we can do it.

1676
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,040
(At that moment, a fish jumped above water.)

1677
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,740
- Did you see that fish jump?
 -  Did it jump?

1678
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,440
As if to make fun of us.

1679
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,870
Can't I move to that side?

1680
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,530
The owner of the fishing place gave us a tip.

1681
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,200
The spots on the edges are the best.

1682
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,330
- Pardon?
 -  The spots on each side.

1683
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,430
(Let's go to recommended spot.)

1684
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,610
- Why did you tell us this late?
 -  You should have told us earlier.

1685
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,360
This is my spot.

1686
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,030
You don't own this spot.

1687
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,360
(Ji Hyo's spot becomes crammed with people.)

1688
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,570
The one who catches a fish first is the owner.

1689
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,470
What is this?

1690
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,370
It's called fishing.

1691
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,110
- Seok Jin is really weird today.
 -  Shall we try some fishing?

1692
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,660
Seok Jin is really weird today.

1693
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,640
There's a pervert in the fishing area.

1694
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,370
Take him away.

1695
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,910
What if we all catch the same fish?

1696
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,740
Why are they moving about?

1697
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:33,960
This is my last spot.

1698
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,040
This is my last spot for fishing.

1699
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,570
Excuse me, are fish caught well here too?

1700
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,800
Are there fish here too?

1701
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,740
(Kwang Soo turned around.)

1702
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,740
The fish keep on leaving after eating my bait.

1703
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,570
(Who will win the second spot for candidacy?)

1704
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,470
- I caught it.
 -  What?

1705
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,570
(I caught it.)

1706
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,660
(At the same time, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo feel a nibble too.)

1707
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,930
- Unbelievable.
 -  I caught it.

1708
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,110
I feel it.

1709
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,440
- Unbelievable.
 -  I caught it.

1710
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,070
(Who will win the right for candidacy?)

1711
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,460
- What is this?
 -  I caught one.

1712
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,650
I caught one.

1713
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,900
- Jae Seok.
 -  I caught one.

1714
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,040
(It got away.)

1715
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,310
(Meanwhile, what about Kwang Soo?)

1716
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,800
- Unbelievable.
 -  I caught it.

1717
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,860
- I caught it.
 -  I feel it.

1718
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,870
(He caught a fish.)

1719
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,900
I caught it.

1720
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,770
- Does that qualify?
 -  It's too small.

1721
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:41,010
- Is that a fish too?
 -  I've caught a big fish.

1722
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,410
- I've caught a big fish.
 -  I'm really jealous.

1723
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,820
- I'm really jealous.
 -  He caught a big fish.

1724
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,400
Ji Hyo, you and me...

1725
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,360
We both felt a nibble.

1726
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,930
- We nearly caught it.
 -  Jae Seok, we both felt it.

1727
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,530
- I was this close.
 -  What is he doing?

1728
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,890
I never even felt a nibble.

1729
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:58,200
How did you catch such a small fish?

1730
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,810
I caught it. I have never caught a fish this big before.

1731
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,510
- He's a professional entertainer.
 -  You're my tuna.

1732
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,400
- I was this close.
 -  Really.

1733
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,880
(Kwang Soo wins the second spot for candidacy.)

1734
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,100
The two candidates have been decided.

1735
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,610
- Really.
 -  It's devil against lout.

1736
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,250
(The candidates for the second king are Haha and Kwang Soo.)

1737
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,830
- Who's who?
 -  I don't know.

1738
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,710
You're the devil and you're the lout.

1739
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,260
You should be careful who you root for.

1740
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,790
- Of course.
 -  That's important.

1741
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,470
I'll begin.

1742
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,060
Will it be devil or lout?

1743
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:30,200
- All right.
 -  I have faith in you, Kwang Soo.

1744
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,410
Please make a wise choice.

1745
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,670
This is tough.

1746
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,560
(Who will the voters choose?)

1747
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,330
Gosh. I wish I could wear a hat.

1748
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:41,960
- We can't be unanimous.
 -  That's right.

1749
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,430
- That's the worst scenario.
 -  Yes, it is.

1750
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,000
- It's the worst if we're unanimous.
 -  You're right.

1751
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,400
We will see the first ballot.

1752
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,330
- Okay.
 -  I hoped I voted with the majority.

1753
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,530
Kwang Soo.

1754
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,760
(Kwang Soo gets one vote.)

1755
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,610
All right.

1756
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:59,040
I should cut the root of that grass. Excuse me.

1757
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,230
- Haha.
 -  Haha.

1758
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,300
My goodness, this fellow.

1759
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,570
Are you taking sides already?

1760
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,060
Well, you know.

1761
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,240
Kwang Soo.

1762
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,400
- Who is it?
 -  Yu.

1763
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,600
- Lee, cross.
 -  Ji, cross.

1764
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,660
I got it.

1765
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,730
Yu Lee Ji.

1766
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:14,930
- Yu Lee Ji.
 -  It's over.

1767
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,970
- Yu Lee Ji.
 -  We only need one more vote.

1768
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,630
- Only one more vote.
 -  Yu Lee Ji.

1769
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,600
- Okay, you three.
 -  That's funny.

1770
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,760
We need just one more person.

1771
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,200
It's definitely shaving one's head.

1772
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,430
- Yu Lee Ji.
 -  Just one more.

1773
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:27,630
(The result depends on this one vote.)

1774
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:32,620
(Will it end with Kwang Soo's victory or a tie?)

1775
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,110
- Just one more person.
 -  Haha. Okay.

1776
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,200
(2 votes for Kwang Soo, 2 votes for Haha)

1777
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,800
- Hurrah!
 -  What is this?

1778
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,860
- Hurrah!
 -  There's one last vote.

1779
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,110
Go over to that side.

1780
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,500
If it doesn't work out, we're all dead.

1781
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,260
- Yu.
 -  Lee.

1782
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,230
- Yu.
 -  Why are you "Yu"?

1783
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,290
- Lee.
 -  Yu.

1784
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,530
- Ga.
 -  My surname is Yu.

1785
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,630
(What?)

1786
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,860
- Yu.
 -  Jee.

1787
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,930
- Ga.
 -  Gary.

1788
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,660
(Gary, are you switching sides?)

1789
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,930
(What has Gary chosen?)

1790
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,600
- Yu.
 -  Ji.

1791
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,640
- Gary.
 -  Ga.

1792
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,100
Gary.

1793
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,330
Hurrah!

1794
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,710
(Go, Haha.)

1795
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:12,980
(2 votes for Kwang Soo, 3 votes for Haha)

1796
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,790
(He looks disappointed.)

1797
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:17,030
Hurrah!

1798
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,100
(Haha becomes the second king.)

1799
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,630
I made a poem for you.

1800
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,000
Haha is higher than the sky.

1801
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,680
Haha is greater than the distance from Earth to the sky.

1802
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,260
Stop it.

1803
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,470
Let me do this.

1804
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,350
- Let's choose colours.
 -  That's great.

1805
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,620
Green seems nice.

1806
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,140
- How could this happen?
 -  Wait.

1807
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:33,630
(Grasshoppers are always green.)

1808
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,110
Gosh.

1809
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,060
- Should we draw red spots on him?
 -  Wait.

1810
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,140
- He looks like a ladybug.
 -  He does look like a ladybug.

1811
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,860
He is very skilled.

1812
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,600
- Jae Seok looks natural.
 -  Next customer!

1813
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,760
Look at me.

1814
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,940
I think pink colour suits Kwang Soo.

1815
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,230
(Jae Seok sprays paint on Kwang Soo this time.)

1816
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,540
It looks like your hair is on fire.

1817
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,660
Doesn't Kwang Soo have to do that?

1818
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,770
- You don't have to do this.
 -  Really?

1819
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,810
- Gosh!
 -  You don't have to do this?

1820
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,710
- Right. I don't have to!
 -  That's right.

1821
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,230
- I didn't have to.
 -  No, you didn't.

1822
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:04,190
What will happen if they have a blind date like that?

1823
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,870
What if they go to a club like that?

1824
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:10,360
- Why do we always lose?
 -  Why is it always the three of us?

1825
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,040
- I'm so fed up with it.
 -  I can't understand.

1826
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:15,910
(The second era, King Haha)

1827
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,000
- We have three here...
 -  Yes.

1828
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,400
- and three here as well.
 -  Okay.

1829
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,810
- I am the umpire.
 -  Okay.

1830
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,530
- We'll have table tennis today.
 -  Okay.

1831
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,050
And we have a great prize for the winner.

1832
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,340
- What is that?
 -  For the winner?

1833
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,340
You may go home if you win.

1834
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,810
- Yes!
 -  You're so cool!

1835
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:36,410
- Win and you can go home.
 -  I'm really bad at table tennis.

1836
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,070
That's why we're playing it.

1837
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:40,700
(If I can go home early, I don't need to be a gentleman.)

1838
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,260
- King Haha!
 -  It's funny.

1839
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,770
- I'm trying to be honest.
 -  He's being honest.

1840
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,300
He could make us laugh because he was honest.

1841
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,710
- Right, he was funny.
 -  Thank you.

1842
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,100
- May I go first?
 -  Okay.

1843
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,230
Do we start now?

1844
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,900
- Yes, it begins now.
 -  I'll start.

1845
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,030
Okay, sure.

1846
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,440
Let's go!

1847
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,040
- Good.
 -  Great.

1848
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,700
- Wow.
 -  You're good.

1849
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,050
- Good.
 -  Great.

1850
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,200
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1851
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,540
It's okay.

1852
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,170
- Way to go!
 -  I want to change the players.

1853
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,120
- Let's go home.
 -  Okay.

1854
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,070
(Players have been changed to Gary and Kwang Soo.)

1855
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:12,560
(It starts.)

1856
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,910
- Okay!
 -  You're doing good.

1857
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,060
- You did it!
 -  You did it!

1858
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,510
(The ball touches the net.)

1859
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,420
- Okay!
 -  He's good.

1860
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,630
(Gary is out.)

1861
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:21,040
It's okay.

1862
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,030
You can beat others too.

1863
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,310
- All you need is confidence.
 -  Okay.

1864
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:26,440
- I can make it!
 -  You need confidence not skills.

1865
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,740
(Kwang Soo is being sly.)

1866
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,740
That's good. That's it.

1867
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:36,910
- You did good.
 -  Great!

1868
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,770
All you need is confidence.

1869
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,210
Kwang Soo.

1870
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,600
Guys, stop it. Let's play.

1871
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,170
- Let's play.
 -  You can do it.

1872
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,940
Be confident in yourself.

1873
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,710
What you need is confidence not skills.

1874
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,980
- Okay!
 -  Good.

1875
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,100
Gosh!

1876
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,360
Why are you celebrating every time you win?

1877
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,970
(They physically celebrate their victory.)

1878
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:02,440
- Be confident.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1879
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,340
(Stop it now.)

1880
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,260
My goodness.

1881
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,870
- Come! Let's play.
 -  Hurry up!

1882
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,440
(Flustered)

1883
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,440
(He was speedy but he missed the ball.)

1884
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,940
(I'll break this table.)

1885
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:29,070
(You humiliated me.)

1886
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,040
- Good.
 -  Calm down.

1887
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,760
(Team Jae Seok needs one more score.)

1888
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,180
You're good.

1889
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,640
Right. Great.

1890
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,200
Jae Seok is good at this.

1891
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,270
You can beat him.

1892
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,430
Great. Way to go!

1893
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,810
(Who will win in this high-class rally?)

1894
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,430
Jae Seok is good at this.

1895
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:49,730
You can beat him.

1896
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,360
Gosh!

1897
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,730
You can beat him.

1898
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,340
- Wow!
 -  Thank you!

1899
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,810
- Thank you!
 -  You got it!

1900
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,140
I don't know if I can say this, but Jae Seok looks like a toad.

1901
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,230
His colourful hair disturbs me.

1902
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,340
Please, let us win.

1903
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,670
You can beat him.

1904
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,900
- You can decide Kwang Soo.
 -  Okay.

1905
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,770
- So, each has one cup. Right?
 -  Yes.

1906
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,610
My pick is Gary.

1907
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,110
I'll choose Jong Kook.

1908
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:21,290
Then, I'll pick Haha.

1909
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,970
Please close your eyes, Seok Jin.

1910
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,100
I thought we could open our eyes.

1911
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,410
- Yes, you can open your eyes now.
 -  Open your eyes.

1912
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,480
- You can.
 -  One, two...

1913
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,070
Three!

1914
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,170
(Water-slapping)

1915
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,700
- Who is it? Is it me?
 -  No, it's not you.

1916
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,570
Yes!

1917
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,630
He'll even survive in abyss.

1918
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,860
(What an immortal guy he is!)

1919
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,800
- He will.
 -  It's amazing.

1920
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,130
Yes!

1921
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:47,940
(Kwang Soo may leave early. And Haha's tenure is over.)

1922
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:53,070
(Gary has 2, Kwang Soo and Haha have 1 each and others have none.)

1923
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,140
(They go to the polling booth to vote for the last king.)

1924
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,830
It's a pirate roulette.

1925
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,600
(They will play with a pirate roulette for the last candidacy.)

1926
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,710
It never works when we want to be chosen.

1927
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,210
Two of us will become candidates? Okay.

1928
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,000
- It's time for the last candidacy.
 -  Okay.

1929
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,610
Two members who are chosen by the roulette will run for the election.

1930
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,940
- Please go ahead, Leader Gary.
 -  Okay.

1931
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,660
Leader Gary.

1932
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,810
All right.

1933
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,600
(He puts a sword in.)

1934
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,910
- Good.
 -  It's only the beginning.

1935
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,560
It's hard to get it in the beginning. Only one sword went in.

1936
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,300
Ji Hyo is usually lucky with these.

1937
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,960
- It'll pop up.
 -  Can we choose colours?

1938
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,210
- Of course.
 -  Oh no.

1939
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,440
- I like red.
 -  I rarely succeed in such games.

1940
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,890
Let me put it hard. Go!

1941
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:34,230
- He failed too.
 -  Gosh.

1942
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,430
You can do it.

1943
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,970
- My goodness.
 -  It didn't work for me.

1944
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,510
I knew it. I never succeed.

1945
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,810
Oh, please. Please!

1946
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,940
- Wow.
 -  Yes!

1947
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,730
(Seok Jin becomes the first candidate.)

1948
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,140
Gosh, I don't want to do this any more.

1949
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,240
- You're so lucky.
 -  You're amazing, Sir.

1950
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,430
Thank you, everyone.

1951
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,600
This time, you should put it in the opposite side.

1952
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,970
I haven't even given it a shot.

1953
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,430
- So you don't play any more?
 -  No, he doesn't.

1954
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:02,440
- Then, let me try.
 -  Okay.

1955
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,630
Wow.

1956
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,940
(Wow!)

1957
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,440
I got goose bumps now.

1958
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,630
I have goose bumps.

1959
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:13,250
(His unluckiness reached the highest level.)

1960
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,910
- This can't be manipulated.
 -  Gosh.

1961
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,200
- How can this happen?
 -  We must air the unedited video.

1962
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,770
- He didn't even think where to put.
 -  Can this really happen?

1963
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:24,420
(We'll show you the original video without any editing.)

1964
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,070
Oh, please. Please.

1965
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,970
Wow!

1966
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:31,310
(After Seok Jin became the first candidate...)

1967
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,170
Now I don't want to play this any more.

1968
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,040
- You're so lucky.
 -  You're amazing, Sir.

1969
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,230
Thank you, everyone.

1970
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,830
We have one more candidate to decide.

1971
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,300
Did you feel something before put the sword in?

1972
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,630
Yes, I did. I could even see it.

1973
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,860
(They reset the roulette for the second candidate.)

1974
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,970
Let's try from the opposite side this time.

1975
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,160
I haven't even given it a shot.

1976
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,430
- Let's try from the other side.
 -  Okay.

1977
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,210
- What a unlucky guy.
 -  You start...

1978
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,060
- Oh, you don't play it any more.
 -  No, he doesn't.

1979
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,290
- Then, I'll try.
 -  Okay.

1980
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:55,640
Wow!

1981
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,940
I got goose bumps now.

1982
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,230
I have goose bumps.

1983
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,900
(He got it again at the chance of 1 out of 24.)

1984
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,910
- He is really unlucky.
 -  It's unbelievable.

1985
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,340
Can this really happen?

1986
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,640
- Gosh.
 -  Amazing.

1987
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,870
- You should see an exorcist.
 -  What are you talking about?

1988
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,270
- This is scary.
 -  Gosh.

1989
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,060
So, Kwang Soo and Seok Jin are the candidates.

1990
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,440
If you want peace, please vote for me.

1991
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,030
Actually, being in this group really hurts my pride.

1992
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,900
If you earn a Go-Home Badge,

1993
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,100
will you give it to one of them?

1994
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,330
- Never.
 -  Are you sure?

1995
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,800
- Of course, because...
 -  If you don't keep this promise,

1996
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,480
and if I don't get any badge, I'll choose you as my partner.

1997
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,430
Oh, really?

1998
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:34,990
(Oh, really?)

1999
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,130
Yes.

2000
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,260
(Seok Jin's voice trembled.)

2001
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,430
I really mean it.

2002
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:39,530
- You do?
 -  Yes.

2003
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,840
You know he's reliable.

2004
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:43,830
(He is always true to his words.)

2005
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,010
It's the same as robbing the Badge.

2006
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,610
That's too much.

2007
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,200
(He feels something ominous.)

2008
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,070
- Then, let's cast our ballots now.
 -  Okay.

2009
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,610
Please go in, Gary and Ji Hyo.

2010
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,240
- Gosh.
 -  It's hard to choose one.

2011
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,860
(Who will become the last king?)

2012
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,740
- This is the last election.
 -  Please.

2013
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:06,860
You chose him?

2014
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,100
(Jae Seok voted for Kwang Soo.)

2015
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,430
- It's Seok Jin.
 -  Yes!

2016
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,610
Good.

2017
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,240
- Seok Jin.
 -  Great!

2018
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:16,810
What was that?

2019
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,700
(Seok Jin released gas.)

2020
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:25,780
(He got too excited and lost his contraction control.)

2021
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,870
(Embarrassed)

2022
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,070
Why do you do that?

2023
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,310
You were too excited.

2024
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:34,970
Were you that happy?

2025
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,940
- How can you fart here?
 -  Were you that happy?

2026
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,560
- Because he's not young any more.
 -  Right.

2027
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,980
Did you fart because you're not so young?

2028
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,640
- Seok Jin.
 -  Yes, it's me.

2029
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,930
- If I didn't vote for you...
 -  It's over.

2030
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,270
If I didn't vote for you...

2031
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:48,760
It's over now.

2032
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,340
- Seok Jin is amazing.
 -  Yes!

2033
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,760
- If I didn't vote for Kwang Soo...
 -  He sent us telepathy.

2034
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,980
- I'm sad.
 -  It's a pity.

2035
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,500
It's because you betrayed others a lot.

2036
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,710
Do I get penalty again?

2037
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,370
Right. That's right.

2038
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,510
We almost forgot about the penalty.

2039
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,030
(No one was thinking about the penalty.)

2040
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,790
We almost forgot about it.

2041
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:08,900
Right, we have the penalty.

2042
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,060
I don't even know what we should do to penalise him.

2043
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,610
(Unlucky Jae Seok got penalties three times in a row.)

2044
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,270
(The third era is Seok Jin's rule. The rule of going home.)

2045
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,630
- Dear me.
 -  My goodness.

2046
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,060
(Jae Seok wore stockings and short pants as a penalty.)

2047
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,980
(Jae Seok is destined to get penalties.)

2048
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,130
How can this happen?

2049
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,510
I have some kind of feeling now.

2050
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:31,200
- What do you mean?
 -  You'd better call your wife now.

2051
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,070
I feel that today's shooting will last even longer.

2052
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,930
But if I give this Badge to Jae Seok,

2053
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,740
I know Jong Kook will keep his words.

2054
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,230
(My penalty partner is Seok Jin.)

2055
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,370
I know Jong Kook will pick me as his partner for penalty.

2056
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:42,170
But if I give it to Jong Kook,

2057
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,440
then Jae Seok will choose me for his penalty partner.

2058
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,600
The last king is the worst.

2059
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,360
- This drives me crazy.
 -  Seok Jin.

2060
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,830
- What you have to decide...
 -  Why did I become the king?

2061
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:51,600
- What you have to decide is...
 -  What?

2062
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,170
who to stay with tonight.

2063
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:56,240
Or you can be a cool guy if you give the badges to both of them.

2064
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,470
Anyway, you'll receive penalty. So just be cool.

2065
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:00,670
So call your wife.

2066
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,500
You have nothing else to do here.

2067
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,060
For an hour, think about who you'll stay with tonight.

2068
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,880
- So I receive penalty anyway.
 -  Right.

2069
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,110
You know that Jong Kook is very true to his words.

2070
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,040
I'm sure he'll pick me if I give the badge to Jae Seok.

2071
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,370
Jae Seok will also do the same if I give it to Jong Kook.

2072
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,370
I don't know why I have to worry about it although I have the badges.

2073
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,360
(It's time for the final decision.)

2074
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,170
- It's time for the final decision.
 -  Okay.

2075
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,030
(6 members with the badges may go home right away.)

2076
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,260
We've prepared all your cars...

2077
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,300
in the parking lot, so that you can go home...

2078
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,070
- Oh, there they are.
 -  if you receive the badge.

2079
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,340
Whoever the last one becomes,

2080
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,400
everyone can go home except the person who has to stay.

2081
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,530
I see.

2082
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,810
And the loser will make a phone call...

2083
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,530
to call a partner.

2084
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,540
(The loser can call a partner.)

2085
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,200
- I should've turned off my phone.
 -  Okay.

2086
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,640
There are 2 people who have more than 2 Go-Home Badges.

2087
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:56,170
You can choose a person each and give the Go-Home Badge.

2088
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,130
Gary, you can choose first.

2089
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:01,000
(Whoever is not chosen by Gary and Seok Jin will be the loser.)

2090
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,400
- Okay.
 -  Okay, I will.

2091
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,830
(Gary chooses first.)

2092
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,260
(Gary has one extra badge.)

2093
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,630
(Jae Seok)

2094
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,500
(Ji Hyo)

2095
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,900
(Jong Kook)

2096
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,400
(Only one of them will be saved.)

2097
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,430
I will make it even harder for Seok Jin to choose.

2098
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:26,710
(Who will be chosen by Gary?)

2099
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,570
Really?

2100
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,800
(It's unbelievable.)

2101
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,200
I'll make it harder to choose.

2102
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,000
(Gary chose Jong Kook.)

2103
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,240
- Really?
 -  I can't believe it.

2104
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:44,130
(No one has expected that.)

2105
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:46,230
(Now only Ji Hyo and Jae Seok are left.)

2106
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:49,160
- Really?
 -  You really chose Jong Kook?

2107
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,910
I will make it so hard for Seok Jin to decide.

2108
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,610
- You two are really close.
 -  He really made it harder...

2109
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:59,040
for Seok Jin to make a decision.

2110
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,800
This is too difficult. You should've given it to Ji Hyo.

2111
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,510
- Then it won't be fun!
 -  I can't believe this.

2112
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,240
You couldn't decide so I helped you out.

2113
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:08,700
(Who will Seok Jin choose?)

2114
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:13,110
- Seok Jin has two badges.
 -  Why are you doing this?

2115
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,240
This is too difficult.

2116
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,310
You have two in your hand.

2117
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:19,160
(Two badges...)

2118
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,530
(and two people)

2119
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,740
Should I just give away both and go with Kwang Soo?

2120
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:28,160
(Do you want to go with me, Kwang Soo?)

2121
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,900
Why are you choosing me? What have I done?

2122
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,620
- You and me together.
 -  Hey, stop it.

2123
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:35,700
- That sounds like a good idea.
 -  I think that sounds perfect.

2124
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,030
- Please don't do this.
 -  That's perfect.

2125
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,530
You are a great judge.

2126
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,860
Okay. You two, take this!

2127
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,970
- That's amazing.
 -  Are you really doing this?

2128
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,930
- And you are going with me.
 -  You don't have to do this.

2129
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:45,400
- You never know.
 -  I'll do as I want.

2130
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,970
Please don't do this! Are you really giving the badges away?

2131
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,290
- I'll handle this.
 -  You went through a lot for this.

2132
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,430
- You spent a whole day for badges.
 -  I'll do as I want.

2133
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:53,220
(Kwang Soo is about to cry.)

2134
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,330
Okay.

2135
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:55,540
(It's time for Seok Jin to decide.)

2136
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,260
(Please choose me.)

2137
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,070
(Not me)

2138
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,160
Here.

2139
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,040
(Whom did he choose?)

2140
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:10,630
(Ji Hyo?)

2141
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,230
(Jae Seok?)

2142
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:14,510
(Kwang Soo?)

2143
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:19,440
(Seok Jin chose Ji Hyo.)

2144
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,010
Are you sure?

2145
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,130
All right. Everyone, go home.

2146
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,130
(Jae Seok is the loser.)

2147
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,270
Please leave.

2148
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,260
- This is even scarier.
 -  I'm scared of Jae Seok's decision.

2149
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,830
(It's time for Jae Seok to choose his partner for tonight.)

2150
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,520
- You never know whom he'll choose.
 -  I will count to three...

2151
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,000
and I will pick the slowest.

2152
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,630
(I will count to three and I will pick the slowest.)

2153
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,800
(Time to go home.)

2154
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,170
(Everyone runs away at full speed.)

2155
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,630
Please don't call me.

2156
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,000
(Please don't call me.)

2157
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,230
I won't answer the phone.

2158
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:51,600
- I won't answer.
 -  I am getting tired now.

2159
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,060
- You must leave before three.
 -  Don't call me.

2160
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,400
I don't want any phone call. Please don't.

2161
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,440
I'll seat in the back.

2162
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:58,230
Oh, please.

2163
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,130
(Everyone is rushing home.)

2164
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,270
Get in. Quickly.

2165
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,000
Quickly.

2166
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,050
- Are you leaving now?
 -  Let's go.

2167
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,110
Are you not?

2168
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:08,210
He's so unpredictable.

2169
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,980
I can pick the slowest car.

2170
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,240
Let's go. Just go.

2171
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:17,000
(The last car just left.)

2172
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,330
It's time for me to decide.

2173
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,530
(It is time for Jae Seok to make a phone call.)

2174
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:25,400
(The member who receives the call must come back.)

2175
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,870
(Hurry up and answer the phone)

2176
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:32,870
(Who is the chosen one?)

2177
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,270
(No!)

2178
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,300
What is this?

2179
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,260
(It is a call from Jae Seok.)

2180
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,440
It's Jae Seok.

2181
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,730
(No way)

2182
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:47,860
No, no way.

2183
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,140
(No way)

2184
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,000
(Just a while ago)

2185
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,940
(He picked Jong Kook.)

2186
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,880
Really?

2187
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,030
I can't believe it.

2188
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,930
(He may still remember the choice.)

2189
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:06,410
(Is that the reason why he is calling Gary?)

2190
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,300
Hey, Gary.

2191
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,600
(Hey, Gary...)

2192
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,340
Why did you choose Jong Kook?

2193
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,770
(He did not forget.)

2194
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,530
(Oh no.)

2195
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:17,540
Jae Seok.

2196
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,000
You can't do this!

2197
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,330
Why not?

2198
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:24,630
Then whom was I supposed to choose?

2199
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,230
Hey, Gary.

2200
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:29,910
You could give your badge to Ji Hyo.

2201
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:32,270
You can't do this to me.

2202
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,670
Oh, well.

2203
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,810
Where are you about?

2204
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,040
Let me see.

2205
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,230
I guess I'm near Jamsil.

2206
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,860
You are near Jamsil?

2207
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,630
(It took three minutes to Jamsil.)

2208
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,410
- Near Jamsil?
 -  No!

2209
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:48,330
It can't be!

2210
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:49,400
(No! It can't be!)

2211
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,510
Okay. See you later, Gary.

2212
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,970
(Okay. See you later, Gary.)

2213
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:59,630
(You just said "See you later.")

2214
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:00,760
I see. Goodbye.

2215
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,970
- Good night.
 -  Good night.

2216
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,410
(Yes)

2217
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,700
(He had enough fun teasing Gary.)

2218
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,910
(And he makes another phone call.)

2219
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:15,040
(It's Ji Hyo this time.)

2220
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:21,040
(Do you want me to go back?)

2221
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:26,030
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok were the last two members.)

2222
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,310
Are you sure?

2223
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:29,540
All right. Everyone, go home.

2224
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,800
I will count to three.

2225
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,330
And I will pick the slowest.

2226
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:37,500
(After chosen by Seok Jin, she ran away as fast as she could.)

2227
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,630
Please.

2228
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:43,510
(Was I impudent to his eyes?)

2229
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,860
- Hello.
 -  Hi, Ji Hyo.

2230
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,910
Yes.

2231
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,230
I'm disappointed.

2232
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:56,700
(Ji Hyo, I'm disappointed.)

2233
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,480
You ran without a second thought.

2234
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:02,600
Jae Seok, maybe you didn't see..

2235
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,920
but I was the last among them. The feeling of guilt delayed me.

2236
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,000
Really?

2237
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,600
I wasn't... I wasn't happy leaving you behind alone.

2238
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,860
Were you sorry?

2239
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:13,940
Yes, I was.

2240
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,630
(Please, Jae Seok.)

2241
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,400
Okay, Ji Hyo.

2242
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,530
You may leave.

2243
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,110
All right. you may leave.

2244
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:24,160
- Okay, Jae Seok.
 -  Okay. Good night.

2245
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,270
Okay. Good night.

2246
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,000
Everyone seems happy.

2247
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,840
(Jae Seok's phone calls are funny but scary.)

2248
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:33,230
(I know your phone is ringing.)

2249
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,430
(So answer it right now.)

2250
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:37,900
(It's Jee Seok Jin.)

2251
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,910
No!

2252
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,860
No, it can't be!

2253
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,070
(No.)

2254
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:43,740
It's Jae Seok.

2255
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,040
(Yu Jae Seok. His name seems so scary.)

2256
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,310
Here.

2257
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:52,330
(Seok Jin abandoned Jae Seok and chose Ji Hyo instead.)

2258
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:53,340
All right.

2259
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,710
Everyone, go home.

2260
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:56,500
(It could be anyone but me.)

2261
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,760
Please leave.

2262
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,410
(It could be anyone but me.)

2263
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,670
Hello?

2264
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,740
Where are you going?

2265
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,910
(Where are you going, Seok Jin?)

2266
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:14,140
You called to say hi, didn't you?

2267
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,000
- Didn't you, Jae Seok?
 -  Where are you going?

2268
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,840
- What?
 -  Where are you going, Seok Jin?

2269
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:20,870
I'm going home.

2270
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,040
Where are you about?

2271
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,730
- What?
 -  Where are you about?

2272
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,530
I am near the motorway, I guess.

2273
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:30,430
(I am near the motorway, I guess.)

2274
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,410
Okay, come! Come back.

2275
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,230
(Seok Jin is the chose one.)

2276
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,310
No!

2277
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:41,540
Okay. Seok Jin is the person that I want.

2278
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,670
My goodness.

2279
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,060
Let's go back.

2280
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,110
(Let's go back.)

2281
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:52,940
(The tale of the first unluckiest man continues.)

2282
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:56,930
(What is the penalty for tonight?)

2283
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,570
It's name is Yong Ma Land.

2284
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,510
What is this place?

2285
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,540
So, do I have to go in?

2286
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:05,270
Really?

2287
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,540
In this abandoned amusement park,

2288
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,310
- there is an abandoned piano.
 -  Please, don't do this to me.

2289
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:12,930
Do we really have to do this?

2290
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,510
(They have to find an abandoned piano.)

2291
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:16,100
Please go in and find the piano.

2292
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,960
You have to sit...

2293
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,760
and play "School Bell".

2294
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,900
(They have to find an abandoned piano and play a song.)

2295
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,770
This place is creepy.

2296
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,130
(They get surprised very easily.)

2297
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,530
- This is so scary.
 -  I'm getting mad.

2298
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,810
This place is driving me crazy.

2299
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:33,730
(Where is the piano?)

2300
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:36,510
- That was weird.
 -  I have a chill.

2301
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:39,310
- Where can we find the piano?
 -  There.

2302
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,370
Have you found it?

2303
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,500
- There it is.
 -  Is that the piano?

2304
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,730
- What is it?
 -  Here it is.

2305
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:45,740
That is the piano.

2306
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,930
(They have found the piano.)

2307
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:51,040
- Oh my goodness.
 -  What is this?

2308
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,410
It's really scary.

2309
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:57,130
- I'm going crazy.
 -  It's cold out here.

2310
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,130
(They have to sit together and play and sing "School Bell.")

2311
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,390
- Here we go.
 -  Here we go.

2312
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:06,030
School bell's ringing, ding, ding, dong

2313
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:09,410
Let's all gather now

2314
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:14,600
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin have to sing "School Bell.")

2315
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,610
The teacher is waiting for us

2316
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,940
No. I don't like this song any more.

2317
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,900
Lee Se Dol and AlphaGo played...

2318
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,130
Lee was defeated again.

2319
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,500
He was defeated twice in a row...

2320
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,370
He resigned.

2321
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,640
(But humans are not defeated yet.)

2322
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:33,530
(The ultimate weapon, Hyeri)

2323
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:34,610
(Song Min Ho and Nam Tae Hyun)

2324
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:37,660
How can we beat that?

2325
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,670
- Go!
 -  Gosh!

2326
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:40,410
It's thinking.

2327
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,960
We can't cut him slack.

2328
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,740
(Will artificial intelligence win or will human instinct win?)

2329
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,830
Running Man has declared a war against machines.

2330
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:50,910
(Next week at Running Man, Robot War)
