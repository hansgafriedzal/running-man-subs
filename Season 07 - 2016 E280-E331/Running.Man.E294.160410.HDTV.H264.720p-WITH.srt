1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,960
(Machines are an apparatus that move using power.)

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,930
(Human and machine)

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,990
(Human hands created machines.)

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,860
The tendency to depend on machines is getting severe.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,560
More people are getting addicted to smart phones.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,790
The number of jobs disappearing will surpass the number of jobs created.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,660
(Machines are now replacing humans.)

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,530
(Messi competes against a robot goalkeeper.)

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,760
(And finally, machines are about to surpass humans.)

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,760
It's tough for humans to beat artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,530
- Watson, who is Jude?
 -  Yes.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,530
(Computer beats humans on a quiz show.)

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,960
Do you think robots will take over the world?

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,260
Don't worry. Even if I evolve into a terminator,

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,430
I will keep you warm and safe in my evil zoo.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,630
(The unavoidable competition will be held today.)

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,860
(Human versus Machine)

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,560
(Hyeri, the ultimate weapon)

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,460
(Song Min Ho and Nam Tae Hyun of WINNER)

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
(Running Man versus Machine, a match where no one backs down)

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,780
How can we beat that?

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,310
(Running Man versus Machine, a match where no one backs down)

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,360
(Will the heartless artificial intelligence win?)

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,430
(Or will the human's instinct counter-attack them?)

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,920
It's the final war that Running Man has declared against machines.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,130
(The final war begins now.)

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,060
(Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul)

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,030
Jae Seok and Seok Jin's...

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,530
one-on-one preliminary match will begin now.

30
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,710
What?

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,950
A preliminary match for what?

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,960
- What is it?
 -  Starting now,

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,390
without a GPS...

34
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,790
(Can they not use a GPS?)

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
- I have no sense of direction.
 -  I find my way very well.

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,330
I have no sense of direction, whatsoever.

37
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,550
He has no sense of direction.

38
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,930
- In the past,
 -  I'm terrible.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,620
he was known for two things.

40
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,690
No sense of direction and troublemaking.

41
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,860
(He was known for having no sense of direction and for making trouble.)

42
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,090
I am serious.

43
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,460
He was well-known for that.

44
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,450
Okay.

45
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,240
You will only use a map and the provided address...

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,190
- to go and pick up the guests.
 -  Is that right?

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,630
- Here's the address.
 -  That's an old map.

48
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,090
- In the old times...
 -  22-19 Cheongdam-dong,

49
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,760
- This...
 -  Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,360
You can't use any digital devices.

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,980
You're banned from using a GPS or a cell phone.

52
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,440
This is crazy.

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,630
This is too tricky.

54
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,560
Without using any digital devices, GPS or cell phones...

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,690
I can't make it to a grocery store without a GPS.

56
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,190
I know Seoul better than him.

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't know the roads well.

58
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,800
I really don't know my way around.

59
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,040
It's impossible for me to win.

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,260
You can go now.

61
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,860
Why is Kwang Soo my partner?

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,490
It's a game I just can't win.

63
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,430
(The mission is to find the guests without using a GPS.)

64
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,560
(The GPS was first introduced in England during the 1920s.)

65
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,990
(In 1997, the GPS with a 2D map was released in Korea.)

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
It is a device that gives you detailed information of the roads...

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,090
so that you can find your way easily on trips.

68
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,780
Go straight until you receive the next direction.

69
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,890
(It has location detection ability.)

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,690
(It guides you through the fastest route.)

71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,080
(They are freed from machines.)

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,690
(They must find the guests using only maps.)

73
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,890
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok head to Cheongdam-dong at the same time.)

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
(The pick up location is 22-19 Cheongdam-dong.)

75
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,160
I've thought of this before.

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,730
I've thought about what would happen if there were no GPS.

77
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,880
I can't even find the exit.

78
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
I have to go towards Yangjae Station, right?

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,260
(He first heads towards Yangjae Station.)

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,390
It's 22-19.

81
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,630
(All he has is a map.)

82
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,960
All right.

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,390
But 22-19 is...

84
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,660
I've never...

85
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,160
read a map before.

86
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,990
Where is 22-19?

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,260
(Even Jae Seok is struggling.)

88
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,660
Let's see...

89
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,630
Gosh, I want to...

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,890
I want to press this part.

91
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,620
After pressing it,

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,790
can't I zoom in?

93
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,360
It's so frustrating.

94
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,130
(Haha and Ji Hyo leave Ttukseom Resort at the same time.)

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,190
All right. I will...

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,590
go to a real estate agency as soon as I get there.

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,760
They are all old, so a real estate agency...

98
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,930
or a police station is the place to go.

99
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,250
Where do you go when you get lost as a child?

100
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,430
You go to a police station.

101
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,990
(In old times, people went to the police station when lost.)

102
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,930
I will go to a police station.

103
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,960
(She will go to a police station.)

104
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't know where the police station is.

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
(It will be a tough journey.)

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,390
Where is the police station?

107
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,360
397.

108
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,190
(I didn't know how precious a GPS was.)

109
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,100
I found it.

110
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,720
(Did he find it?)

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,860
It's here.

112
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,760
I should go this way.

113
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,190
I'll make a P-turn here and come back.

114
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,760
There's a gas station over here.

115
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,360
(There's a gas station nearby.)

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,830
Instead of going into the gas station,

117
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,490
I'll turn right.

118
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,330
(Kwang Soo's destination is also Hapjeong-dong.)

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,060
What should I do?

120
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,060
I don't think I should get off this road.

121
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,260
(He is moving in the complete opposite direction.)

122
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,360
It's Dongjak Bridge.

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
(He found a path to Dongjak Bridge.)

124
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,360
Should I get off here?

125
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,190
I missed it. What should I do? I missed it.

126
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,100
I missed it.

127
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,390
I think this is the way to Namyangju.

128
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,230
What should I do? Should I cross Hannam Bridge?

129
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,360
(He's getting further away from Hapjeong-dong.)

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,530
I think I should cross Hannam Bridge.

131
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,690
That's the road to Hannam-dong. I need to go...

132
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,330
I missed it!

133
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,730
I missed it!

134
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,630
Whatever. I'm going to drive all the way to Busan today.

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,660
There's a police officer.

136
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,660
(Officer, please help me.)

137
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,830
Hello, Sir.

138
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,050
Do you know the way to Hannam-dong?

139
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,090
- Hannam-dong?
 -  Yes.

140
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,660
It's right across this bridge.

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,930
- That's Hannam-dong?
 -  Yes.

142
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,390
- Exactly where are you going?
 -  Hannam-dong...

143
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,160
It's Hapjeong-dong.

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,530
(Guest pick up location: Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu)

145
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm sorry. I meant Hapjeong-dong not Hannam-dong.

146
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,860
- In Mapo-gu?
 -  Yes.

147
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,130
Then why did you come this way?

148
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,690
Is this the wrong way?

149
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,590
From here,

150
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,920
you need to go in the opposite direction for Hapjeong-dong.

151
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,530
- You can't turn around here.
 -  I see.

152
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,160
So this is the fastest way.

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,360
I should cross Dongjak Bridge then. Thank you.

154
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,660
- Thank you, Sir.
 -  You look handsome.

155
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,530
Thank you, Sir. Salute!

156
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,190
(Police officers are always there for us.)

157
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,030
(He finally finds the right direction and sets off.)

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,860
(It's so difficult to be independent from machines.)

159
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,690
(Who is the guest that they will meet today?)

160
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,960
(With lively bobbed hair,)

161
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,090
(she's a woman whose bright smile is beautiful.)

162
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,490
(They are both cute and chic.)

163
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,690
(These two men are full of charm.)

164
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,730
(The drivers are on their way to pick up the guests.)

165
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,460
I think I know roughly where this is.

166
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,490
It's near Cheongdam Nursery School.

167
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,630
I found where it is.

168
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,930
(He found the location of his destination.)

169
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,090
I found it!

170
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,490
From now on, I should walk on foot.

171
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,620
I think it's somewhere near here.

172
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,780
I think I should take a look around here.

173
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,090
22-19.

174
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,860
It's around here.

175
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,830
(It is frustrating since they can't use their phones.)

176
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,660
(Laughing)

177
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,300
Isn't this it?

178
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,930
The zip code is 06062.

179
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,990
This is 1-11.

180
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,730
Then it's not this place.

181
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,330
Excuse me, what is the address of this place?

182
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,760
It's 22-20.

183
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,630
Did you say 20? Then 19 is the next one.

184
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,790
(19 is next door.)

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,860
This must be it.

186
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,160
It's here. Wait.

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,720
It's 20. This is it!

188
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,390
I found it.

189
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,520
(Seok Jin arrived at 22-19.)

190
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,160
I think it's nearby.

191
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,820
Wait, is this it?

192
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
(Jae Seok also arrived at 22-19.)

193
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,660
There are many...

194
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,760
(Who arrived first, Jae Seok or Seok Jin?)

195
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Yes!

196
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,240
(Inside the building, a charming woman is waiting for them.)

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,220
(She resembles the beauty of spring.)

198
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh, my.

199
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,220
Hello.

200
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Are you today's guest?

201
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,860
(A charming woman is getting her hair done.)

202
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,750
(Who will it be, Jae Seok or Seok Jin?)

203
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,990
It's Hyeri.

204
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,210
Hello.

205
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,360
Are you the guest today?

206
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,620
Are you not?

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
- What are you doing here?
 -  What?

208
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
(It's the rising actress, Hyeri.)

209
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,560
(From Hyeri of Girl's Day,)

210
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,590
(she has transformed into an actress.)

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,260
My mouth is paralysed from the cold.

212
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,680
(Thanks to Hyeri, everyone in Korea is reminiscing the 80s.)

213
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,160
(Hyeri captivated the viewers' hearts.)

214
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,660
Are you not?

215
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,960
- What are you doing here?
 -  What?

216
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,460
They told me to find a place with the address 22-19.

217
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,780
So I was looking for this place.

218
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,190
- Really?
 -  Yes.

219
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,190
- Wow.
 -  Am I right? Yes!

220
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,250
- Hyeri.
 -  Hyeri.

221
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,690
- It's nice to see you.
 -  Goodness.

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,410
Thank you.

223
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,490
- You look very cute in person.
 -  Oh, gosh.

224
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,990
Thank you.

225
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
What should we...

226
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,960
It's Jae Seok.

227
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,060
(Jae Seok is calling Seok Jin.)

228
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,220
Hello, Jae Seok.

229
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,620
- Are you there yet?
 -  Did you find it?

230
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm at the intersection in Dosan-daero.

231
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,190
- You're at the intersection?
 -  Yes.

232
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,390
Wait a minute.

233
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,830
- Let's take a photo.
 -  Sure.

234
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,720
(It's my victory.)

235
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
He's at Dosan intersection.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
- He's a fool.
 -  A fool.

237
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,230
He must be a fool. He was so confident.

238
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,330
All right.

239
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,960
(A smile of triumph.)

240
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
(Laughing)

241
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,660
(What's he doing?)

242
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,260
(Hello, Seok Jin.)

243
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,160
(Jae Seok walks out from the bathroom where he was hiding.)

244
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,440
Oh, my.

245
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
How embarrassing.

246
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,360
This is embarrassing.

247
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,830
(I'm so embarrassed.)

248
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,790
You're great at acting.

249
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,890
(His compliment sounds menacing.)

250
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,190
You're a great actress.

251
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,760
(How did this happen?)

252
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,920
Hi, Hyeri!

253
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,900
Goodness.

254
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,620
Hello. Hyeri.

255
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,550
It's been a long time.

256
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,770
- Are you healthy and well?
 -  Yes.

257
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,890
- Really?
 -  Yes.

258
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh, my.

259
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,260
Do I need to take a photo with Hyeri?

260
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,920
- Really?
 -  Oh my goodness.

261
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,460
- Come here.
 -  Okay.

262
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,420
(Even without a GPS, I can find my way to Hyeri.)

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,060
- Finish getting your hair done.
 -  All right.

264
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,960
- See you later.
 -  Where are you going?

265
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,490
I need to wait for Seok Jin.

266
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,790
Get your hair done. I'll go hide.

267
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,760
Hyeri, pretend that I didn't arrive yet.

268
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,030
- All right.
 -  I'll be hiding here.

269
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,220
This is funny. It's so fun.

270
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,390
You're great at acting.

271
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,960
My goodness.

272
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,860
How could you just hang up on me?

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,020
How could you... You're better than him.

274
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,890
You looked innocent.

275
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
- Really.
 -  So...

276
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,270
Hyeri, Seok Jin and I are on the same team.

277
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,620
- Yu.
 -  Hye.

278
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,960
- Jee.
 -  Cross!

279
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,460
- Let's get going. Let's go.
 -  Yu Hye Jee.

280
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,520
- Let's go, Hyeri.
 -  All right.

281
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,020
(How are Gary and Kwang Soo doing on their race without a GPS?)

282
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,410
Is this the right way?

283
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,560
Is this it?

284
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,690
I think it is.

285
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,890
This must be a coincidence.

286
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,020
(He found it by chance.)

287
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,160
(He gets out of the car to check the address.)

288
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,900
(Is it YG Entertainment?)

289
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,120
Hello.

290
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,090
Is the address here 397-5?

291
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,370
- Yes.
 -  Is it?

292
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,690
(He found the destination without a GPS.)

293
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,060
Then who could the guest be?

294
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,110
(Where is the guest?)

295
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,060
(He looks confused.)

296
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,220
(Wriggling)

297
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,940
Hold on.

298
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
(Wait a minute.)

299
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,090
(He's acting awkwardly.)

300
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,260
It's Song Min Ho.

301
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,280
- Hello.
 -  Are you today's guest?

302
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,590
Yes, I am.

303
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,520
(Song Min Ho is the charismatic rapper of WINNER.)

304
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,190
- You look handsome.
 -  Thank you.

305
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,190
I need to take a photo with you.

306
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,060
(He first takes a photo to complete the mission.)

307
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,190
(Two rappers take a photo together.)

308
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,560
(But it looks like a star and an ugly man.)

309
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,790
(Haha and Ji Hyo have arrived near Cheongdam-dong.)

310
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,890
It's strange. I can't find it when I need it.

311
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,160
Wait, I think it'll be here.

312
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
(He is looking for a real estate agency.)

313
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,490
There are many real estate agencies here.

314
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,790
(There are many over here.)

315
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,420
I've already succeeded.

316
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,720
(I'm going to win.)

317
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,990
I found it! I found the police station!

318
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,620
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

319
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,490
(Guest pick up location: 5-9 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu)

320
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,920
Hello, Sir.

321
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,810
Do you know where 5-9 Cheongdam-dong is?

322
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,160
- We are over here.
 -  I see.

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,740
So 5-9 is over here. Cheongdam intersection is over here.

324
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,620
- I need to turn left here.
 -  You need to go this way.

325
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,090
- I need to go this way.
 -  I see.

326
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,360
Thank you.

327
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,490
(Haha versus Ji Hyo)

328
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,890
(Who will arrive first?)

329
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,560
I found it, I found it!

330
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,190
Is the guest in the salon here?

331
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,260
(Haha arrives at the front door of the building.)

332
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,560
(Ji Hyo arrives at the parking lot in the basement.)

333
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,660
Hello.

334
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,090
What is the address of this building?

335
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,420
- It's 5-9.
 -  Is it 5-9?

336
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,390
It is the salon. I was smart to come here.

337
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,460
(Running)

338
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,660
(Oh, my.)

339
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,490
(Goodness, it's Ji Hyo.)

340
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,820
(Haha and Ji Hyo arrive at the same time.)

341
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,860
(They need to find the guest first.)

342
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,990
Oh, my.

343
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,460
Where is the guest?

344
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,060
Who is it?

345
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,500
(He kidnaps the guest.)

346
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,960
Why are you doing this?

347
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,020
Come here.

348
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,960
- Hello.
 -  I need to take a photo with you.

349
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
- Hello.
 -  I need to take a photo.

350
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,320
(He takes a photo immediately.)

351
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,060
(It's Tae Hyun.)

352
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,690
(It's Nam Tae Hyun of WINNER who has a sweet voice.)

353
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,660
(He is skilled in not only dancing and singing, but acting as well.)

354
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,590
That was close.

355
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,760
(A one-second difference separated the winner from the loser.)

356
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
- It's hectic from the first meet.
 -  I know.

357
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,910
So you're the guest.

358
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,920
- I didn't know. They don't tell us.
 -  Really?

359
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,090
- Oh, my.
 -  Let's go.

360
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,860
(They complete their mission by picking up the guest.)

361
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,960
(Mok-dong SBS Broadcasting Centre in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul)

362
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,660
Is it that difficult?

363
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,360
You only need to visit a real estate agency.

364
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,790
(Gary, Kwang Soo and Min Ho arrive.)

365
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,160
- It's Kwang Soo and Gary.
 -  It's Gary.

366
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,820
- Oh, it's Min Ho.
 -  Oh, really.

367
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,690
- It's been a long time.
 -  Today's guests are so handsome.

368
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,090
We have such handsome guests today.

369
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,760
We'd better keep a low profile today.

370
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,490
- She's coming.
 -  Who's the other guest?

371
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,160
- Oh, my.
 -  Hello.

372
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,090
- Oh, my.
 -  It's Hyeri.

373
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,020
- It's Hyeri!
 -  It's Deok Seon!

374
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,520
- It's Deok Seon.
 -  Deok Seon.

375
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,900
- Deok Seon.
 -  Hello.

376
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,960
- Oh, my.
 -  It's Deok Seon.

377
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,820
- "The winner is Song Min Ho."
 -  It's Min Ho and Tae Hyun.

378
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,520
- Hello.
 -  Welcome.

379
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,790
- I can't believe this.
 -  It's Deok Seon.

380
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,360
It's Deok Seon!

381
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,720
- Hyeri is here.
 -  I can't believe this.

382
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,790
- It's unbelievable.
 -  Hyeri's sister...

383
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,020
is a huge fan of yours.

384
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,120
But I like Hyeri more.

385
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,190
(He likes Hyeri more.)

386
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,820
Her sister is beautiful as well.

387
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,090
- Really?
 -  She's so beautiful.

388
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,450
It's very nice to meet you.

389
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,820
It's very nice to meet you, too.

390
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,660
He's standing right next to Ji Hyo.

391
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,920
- I know.
 -  I'm your fan.

392
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,060
- Tae Hyun loves you.
 -  I'm your fan, too.

393
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,660
- By the way, I don't see Jong Kook.
 -  Where is he?

394
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,190
- Hurray!
 -  Hurray!

395
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,990
- Is he not coming today?
 -  That's why...

396
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,360
- it's been unusually...
 -  It'll be so nice.

397
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,490
- Really?
 -  cheerful today.

398
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,360
- The staff look happy, too.
 -  They do.

399
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,660
It's so peaceful.

400
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,790
We're finally free.

401
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,290
He's attending an awards ceremony abroad.

402
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,620
- I see.
 -  Oh, okay.

403
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,090
If he's attending an awards ceremony,

404
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,060
I'd like to wish him good luck.

405
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,920
It'd be perfect if Jae Seok wasn't here.

406
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
(Haha wishes Jae Seok was also gone.)

407
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,190
It'd be so nice.

408
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,220
That'll never happen.

409
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,820
(Frozen)

410
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,860
You were not allowed to use your phones or GPS, right?

411
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,090
- No, we weren't.
 -  We didn't use them.

412
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,020
The reason for this mission is because recently,

413
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,460
the match between Lee Se Dol and AlphaGo received a lot of attention.

414
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,220
Today's theme is "Human versus Machine".

415
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,460
Oh, "Human versus Machine".

416
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,260
- Are we fighting against them?
 -  You'll fight against machines...

417
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,620
until there's only one survivor left.

418
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,960
The final winner...

419
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,620
will be given a prize...

420
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,920
while the others will be penalised.

421
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,260
By accomplishing intermediate missions,

422
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,260
- you'll win R Coins...
 -  Really?

423
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,560
which you can use in the final mission.

424
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
For the intermediate missions,

425
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,420
- we'll hand out maps.
 -  Okay.

426
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,660
- "Robot Arms"?
 -  "Robot Arms".

427
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,060
- Is it the number of coins?
 -  They're all in Ilsan.

428
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,420
- There's something at SBS, too.
 -  We should start here.

429
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,690
We'd better start here.

430
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,720
You should finish all the races by 5pm...

431
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,060
- and arrive at the destination.
 -  I see.

432
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,590
Okay, let's go!

433
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,820
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

434
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,890
(The war between humans and machines begins.)

435
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,390
(What kind of cutting-edge robots will be waiting for them?)

436
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,190
What should we choose?

437
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,090
Robot Arms, 30 versus 30,

438
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,890
Rap Battle...

439
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,450
- Should we try Robot Arms?
 -  Sure.

440
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,650
What do you think?

441
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,300
(They choose Robot Arms.)

442
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,530
We have to go to Deogeun-dong, Deokyang-gu, Goyang-Si.

443
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,960
(They have to get there without a GPS.)

444
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,720
(Pondering)

445
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,220
- Gyeongui Line...
 -  Don't you know how to read maps?

446
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,170
I have no idea.

447
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,260
Deok Seon, please.

448
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,760
(She has the same character as her role does.)

449
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,990
Deok Seon has no idea.

450
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,160
Tae Hyun, do you know how to read maps?

451
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,480
Then again...

452
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,920
(Isn't this how you read it?)

453
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,960
I don't think you'd know.

454
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,060
(Tae Hyun is of no help, either.)

455
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,280
Let me see.

456
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,380
(Will we get there in time?)

457
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,590
I know we should take the Jayu-ro.

458
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,420
- We can't use the GPS?
 -  No.

459
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,090
That's crazy. Gosh.

460
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,160
Should we follow them?

461
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,660
Should we follow Jae Seok?

462
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,060
Should we? It'll be too hard otherwise.

463
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm sure Jae Seok will be able to find his way.

464
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,960
Jae Seok is good with directions.

465
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll follow him.

466
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Follow him.

467
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,960
I bet Gary will have a hard time.

468
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,760
Gary's very bad with directions.

469
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,890
Min Ho will look even more handsome around them.

470
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,990
He will shine among them.

471
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,660
- He definitely will.
 -  You're right.

472
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,290
I wish I was in his place.

473
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,420
(Anyone can look handsome around them.)

474
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,030
I wish I was with Gary and Haha.

475
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
Hurry.

476
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,460
(To the left is a squid.)

477
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
(Behind is a mushroom.)

478
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Where should we go?

479
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,190
Why don't we go to Rap Battle?

480
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,280
Do you want to go to Rap Battle?

481
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,820
(They decide to go to Rap Battle.)

482
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Rap Battle.

483
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,350
Min Ho will have an advantage.

484
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,790
We just have to win against the machines.

485
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,320
- They can't be good rappers.
 -  That makes sense.

486
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,190
- I can easily beat them.
 -  Of course.

487
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,190
- Gosh, that confidence.
 -  He's so confident.

488
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,260
(Min Ho is confident.)

489
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,590
I'm sure Min Ho has already come up with at least 100 rhymes.

490
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,600
I have 120 rhymes ready.

491
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,710
Great.

492
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,190
I have 125 of them.

493
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,390
Wow, that's swag.

494
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,990
Can we hear three of them?

495
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,490
Jo, yo, ho

496
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,620
(Jo, yo, ho)

497
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,760
(Haha used to be a part of Z-Kiri.)

498
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,560
- Is that the three?
 -  Exactly.

499
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,590
"Jo, yo, ho".

500
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,320
(The hip hop brothers are ready to battle against the machines.)

501
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,030
(Team Jae Seok has already arrived at the destination.)

502
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,660
- It must be here.
 -  It's here.

503
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,560
- Nice.
 -  Yes.

504
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,660
(Excited)

505
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,720
Let's get off.

506
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,030
(Is that Seok Jin?)

507
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,160
Follow them.

508
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,960
It's better to come second than get lost.

509
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,190
You're right. Let's follow them.

510
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,290
We shouldn't lose them.

511
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,820
Where is it? It's here!

512
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,650
It's here. Let's get off!

513
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,820
- Get off.
 -  Seok Jin, get off!

514
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,040
(They rush out of the car.)

515
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,090
Let's get off.

516
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
What is this?

517
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,380
- We came first!
 -  We came first!

518
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,220
(What?)

519
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,460
(What is this?)

520
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,060
(The two teams are greeted by...)

521
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,760
(a robotic arm.)

522
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,090
Why is there a balloon?

523
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,190
(There's a balloon.)

524
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,820
- What is this?
 -  This mission...

525
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,290
will require you to compete with a robotic arm.

526
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,420
(This industrial robotic arm was made in the 70s.)

527
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,120
(They're used in electronic production processes.)

528
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,790
(They can move 30cm in less than half a second.)

529
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,290
(German ping-pong player Timo Boll has competed against it.)

530
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,590
In this mission,

531
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,920
you will have to pop as many balloons as possible.

532
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,790
(Whoever pops 30 balloons the fastest wins.)

533
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,790
Popping balloons?

534
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,530
The robot will pop balloons on the screen...

535
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,760
while you will pop the real balloons.

536
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,730
Whoever pops 30 balloons first will win.

537
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,420
You got here first, so you can go first.

538
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,970
- I'll go first.
 -  Okay.

539
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,290
I'll go first.

540
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,320
A battle between a human and a machine.

541
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,860
The human representative is...

542
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,220
Jee Seok Jin, the weakling.

543
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,620
Seok Jin will play first.

544
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,680
(Seok Jin will represent the humans.)

545
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,260
Humans can win.

546
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,420
- You're right.
 -  Seok Jin.

547
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,750
- Look at that.
 -  It's so fast.

548
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,820
(It's so fast.)

549
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,760
It's so fast.

550
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,360
- Look at that.
 -  What is it doing?

551
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,860
- What's that?
 -  It's dancing.

552
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,420
- It's dancing.
 -  Is it dancing?

553
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,560
It's only warming up, but it's so fast.

554
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,190
- It's incredible.
 -  Don't I look like a machine, too?

555
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,590
- It's really fast.
 -  It's amazing.

556
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,060
This game will be no problem for the machine.

557
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,420
Look at what Seok Jin is doing.

558
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,030
- Get ready.
 -  Gosh.

559
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,490
I'm losing my confidence.

560
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,460
(Seok Jin versus Robotic arm)

561
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,060
- It has started.
 -  Something's coming up.

562
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,260
I can definitely win.

563
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,820
Okay.

564
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,570
(Popping)

565
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,860
I'll alternate between two hands.

566
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,420
- Left hand.
 -  Oh, my.

567
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,680
This doesn't seem too hard.

568
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,720
With two hands...

569
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
He's in trouble.

570
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,260
(A bunch of balloons come up.)

571
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,530
He's in trouble. He has no chance.

572
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,030
Look.

573
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,560
- Look at that.
 -  How will he beat that?

574
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,920
(Struggling)

575
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
He has no chance.

576
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,960
(Popping)

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
Look at the robot.

578
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
How can it do that?

579
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,490
How is it possible?

580
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,920
Look at that.

581
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,860
(How will he beat that?)

582
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,760
(I can't give up.)

583
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,090
(Seok Jin spurts.)

584
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,720
(I might be weak,)

585
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,790
(but I can't lose to a robot.)

586
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,060
(The robotic arm is done with the mission.)

587
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
(Despite his spurt,)

588
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,690
(Seok Jin lost by three balloons.)

589
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,220
- That was close.
 -  That was really close.

590
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
(Disappointed)

591
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,990
(Seok Jin did a better job than expected.)

592
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,390
- That was close.
 -  It's possible.

593
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,420
The thing is,

594
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,820
I hit the balloons with my knuckles because I'm used to that method.

595
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,780
- But these were on my fingers.
 -  Why are you used to it?

596
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,090
(Jae Seok humiliates him.)

597
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,290
Why are you used to hitting things with your knuckles?

598
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,860
He's famous for his punches in Suyu-dong.

599
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
(His punches are famous in Suyu-dong.)

600
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,290
I'd love to experience them.

601
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,920
They're famous for being weak.

602
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,090
Please give me a punch.

603
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,280
- He's famous.
 -  People love my punches.

604
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,890
His punches make people laugh.

605
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,360
Because they're so weak.

606
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,010
(Only humans can laugh after losing.)

607
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,610
Next, it's Hyeri's turn.

608
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,220
(The next human representative is Hyeri.)

609
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,420
- I can do it!
 -  You can do it!

610
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,490
You can do it!

611
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,760
(They enthusiastically cheer for her.)

612
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,470
Ready.

613
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,560
Bring it on!

614
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,020
(The match between Hyeri and the robotic arm...)

615
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,260
(starts.)

616
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,890
You should read the pattern.

617
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,220
She's fast.

618
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,040
Hyeri, you're faster than the robot.

619
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,560
Good job.

620
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,890
(Hyeri is ahead so far.)

621
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,020
(The balloons will start swarming out soon.)

622
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,190
They'll swarm out.

623
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,520
Take it easy.

624
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,960
(I won't miss anything.)

625
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,220
(Hyeri has strong arms from years of dancing.)

626
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,660
(I'll show you what I can do.)

627
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,390
- Hyeri, you're doing great.
 -  Jump!

628
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,520
- You're doing a great job.
 -  Jump!

629
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,630
(She's as fast as the robotic arm.)

630
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,660
- They're neck-and-neck.
 -  No one knows what will happen.

631
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,590
(No one can predict who will win.)

632
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,320
(The robotic arm finished first again.)

633
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,290
(A swift and accurate movement)

634
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,720
That was close.

635
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,990
(Still, Hyeri did an amazing job.)

636
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,290
- Only three balloons were left.
 -  She was fast.

637
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
My goodness.

638
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,090
(Is it even possible to beat the robotic arm?)

639
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,920
The weather is nice today.

640
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,990
(Team Gary is headed for Rap Battle.)

641
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,560
- Should I turn left?
 -  Yes.

642
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,490
- Machines have no emotions.
 -  Exactly.

643
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,720
But we have a rapper who is full of emotions.

644
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,620
(Gary, the hip hop poet)

645
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,320
- Stop it. You're flattering me.
 -  I'm a huge fan.

646
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,610
I loved your rap.

647
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,420
Back in 1996...

648
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,920
(Arrogant)

649
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,890
I used to...

650
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,060
You know what?

651
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,760
Gary almost became a member of H.O.T.

652
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
- Really?
 -  Stop it!

653
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,220
- Come on.
 -  If he didn't do hip hop,

654
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,780
- That's embarrassing.
 -  he could've replaced Kangta.

655
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,790
- Really?
 -  Yes.

656
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,790
No, I couldn't.

657
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,990
Yes, you could've.

658
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,560
It's a bit too late to say now.

659
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,860
I did audition though.

660
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,590
You denied their offer afterwards.

661
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,860
(If Gary didn't deny the offer after passing the audition,)

662
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,090
(people would've seen this kind of H.O.T. debut in 1996.)

663
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,360
That's so interesting.

664
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,110
Isn't this the world's first rap battle against a machine?

665
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,660
How is it possible?

666
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,390
(What will these three rappers show us in the battle?)

667
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,060
(The three rappers have arrived for the battle.)

668
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,660
(Gary, one of the most famous rappers in Korea)

669
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,760
(Haha, a renowned rapper from the group Z-Kiri)

670
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,420
(Min Ho, a talented and rising new rapper of WINNER)

671
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,190
(Who will compete against them?)

672
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,730
Is this where the battle will take place?

673
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,850
Rap battle.

674
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,190
Don't we need more people for a rap battle?

675
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,090
- Rap battle.
 -  What is this?

676
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,480
Where is the rapper?

677
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,860
Where is the microphone?

678
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,560
Welcome to the rap battle.

679
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,470
Before we begin,

680
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,250
you must show us your rap skills.

681
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,050
Don't you know how good we are?

682
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,270
What's up?

683
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,590
Roll your brows up

684
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,190
We have showed up

685
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,290
Everyone, put your hands up

686
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,920
(This is Z-Kiri style rapping.)

687
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,390
(He is ashamed of what he has done.)

688
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,690
I guess that was enough.

689
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,220
They only asked us to do this so we can see Min Ho rap.

690
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,420
(It's Min Ho's turn.)

691
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,590
Show us your rhyme.

692
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,890
Ayo, rap battle

693
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,590
This is hip hop

694
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,290
I want to eat some gimbap

695
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,490
(He wants some gimbap.)

696
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,550
Everyone, come here and hop

697
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes.

698
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,730
This is hip hop, you know?

699
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,290
It's MINO in the building

700
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,780
The winner is Min Ho.

701
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,160
All right. It's time to begin the rap battle.

702
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,420
- Was that it?
 -  You are making me feel awkward.

703
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,160
Delete my rapping scene, okay?

704
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,860
Don't make me repeat. Do as I say.

705
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,920
- Just remove the part.
 -  Use Haha's part.

706
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,990
Get rid of it.

707
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,670
Here comes your opponent.

708
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,320
All right. Please come in.

709
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
What is that?

710
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,970
Rhyme box?

711
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,990
Rhyme box.

712
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,860
So that is the rhyme box.

713
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,120
(Who is going to have a rap battle against these three rappers?)

714
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,560
(It looks cool...)

715
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,160
(and has a colourful fashion style.)

716
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,590
- Wow.
 -  What is that?

717
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,960
(Here comes the rapping robot.)

718
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,420
- Rapping robot?
 -  Rapping robot?

719
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,560
Where is it from?

720
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,790
- Isn't that a plastic wrap?
 -  Goodness!

721
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,380
(Plastic "wrap"?)

722
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,620
- So it's "Wrap"?
 -  Is this what you're talking about?

723
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,020
So this was a "Wrap" battle?

724
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,160
So are we competing on how fast we unwrap things...

725
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,470
or how fast we wrap boxes?

726
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,790
(It was developed and sold in the 80s.)

727
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,390
(It's a robot that automatically wraps large factory objects.)

728
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,420
(It can travel 80m per minute.)

729
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,320
(Its radius of rotation is 800mm.)

730
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,090
(It works 200 times per charge.)

731
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,160
- So it's "Wrap"?
 -  Is this what you're talking about?

732
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,760
Are we going to wrap the boxes?

733
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,990
(Why did we rap just a minute ago?)

734
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,420
We were shouting, "This is hip hop!"

735
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,010
You will compete against this automatic wrapping machine...

736
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,130
on how fast you can wrap objects.

737
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,520
You must wrap the bottom area 20 times as fast as you can.

738
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,620
(Whoever wraps it 20 times first wins.)

739
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,270
Please begin as soon as I blow the whistle.

740
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,680
- Let's go.
 -  We can do it.

741
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,690
Ready.

742
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,660
(Will this robot, which was made for wrapping, win?)

743
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,160
(Or will Haha, a rapper from Z-Kiri, win?)

744
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,190
- Go.
 -  Let's go.

745
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,690
- Go.
 -  Let's go.

746
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,690
Let's go.

747
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,160
(The machine moves.)

748
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,060
- All right. Let's go.
 -  One.

749
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,290
Be careful.

750
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Two.

751
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,390
(They are wrapping at similar speeds.)

752
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,390
Two.

753
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,390
(Haha is faster.)

754
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,290
- I'm dizzy.
 -  Four.

755
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,560
It's only your fourth round.

756
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,790
- Five.
 -  Fifth round.

757
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,590
(Haha's already on his fifth.)

758
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,020
- Six.
 -  Haha, you'd better go lower.

759
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,190
(It's the sixth rotation.)

760
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,190
- Seven.
 -  Seven.

761
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,090
(It's the seventh rotation.)

762
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,120
(He is getting noticeably slower.)

763
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,660
- Let's go.
 -  Go. Yes.

764
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,690
Z-Kiri.

765
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,820
- Z-Kiri, show us your skills.
 -  Z-Kiri!

766
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,290
(Haha falls down.)

767
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,690
- Oh, no.
 -  You are on your ninth round.

768
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,820
Try to catch a rhythm.

769
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,320
- He is on his 10th.
 -  10.

770
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,160
(The robot is on its 13th turn and Haha is on his 10th.)

771
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,790
- Come on.
 -  Go, go, go!

772
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,720
Keep your rhythm.

773
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,260
Yes, keep the rhythm.

774
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,990
(Haha falls after his 11th turn.)

775
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,460
11. Haha.

776
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,660
- Come on, Haha!
 -  You don't have time to rest!

777
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,120
(The robot is on its 13th turn with constant speed.)

778
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,590
- Z-Kiri.
 -  You have bad stamina.

779
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
This is so tiring.

780
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,760
(He falls again.)

781
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,920
(I can't do this any more.)

782
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,660
(Haha gives up after his 13th turn.)

783
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,390
Haha has failed.

784
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,140
Well done.

785
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,790
You have done well.

786
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,360
- Well done.
 -  This is so hard.

787
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,790
This... This is so hard.

788
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,220
It's because you have to keep your back bent.

789
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,480
This is so hard. Try it.

790
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,420
Try it. You'll die.

791
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,560
(Is it too tough for humans to beat a machine?)

792
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,660
Song Ji Hyo.

793
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Yes.

794
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,360
- I will give it a try.
 -  Stretch your arms out.

795
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,720
All right. Ready, set...

796
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,390
You can do it, Ji Hyo.

797
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,960
(Popping)

798
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,660
She's accurate.

799
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,690
(The second balloon is popped right away.)

800
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,760
You are doing well.

801
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,760
Good job.

802
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,660
(Here comes the swarm of balloons.)

803
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
There you go.

804
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,920
(The balloons bounce off.)

805
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,320
- Come on, Ji Hyo.
 -  Goodness.

806
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,490
(Ji Hyo misses many balloons.)

807
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,060
- She is doing well.
 -  Good job.

808
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,160
- She is catching up.
 -  She might win.

809
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,290
- You're doing well.
 -  Come on.

810
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,560
- Come on.
 -  Behind you!

811
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,760
(They are at a similar pace.)

812
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
- Behind you.
 -  Come on, Ji Hyo.

813
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,560
(She is punching like Mayweather.)

814
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,660
(Can she defeat the robotic arm?)

815
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,120
Come on, Ji Hyo.

816
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,160
(Can she defeat the robotic arm?)

817
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,680
Come on, Ji Hyo.

818
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,540
(There is only 1 left.)

819
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,160
(The robotic arm beats Ji Hyo by 1 balloon.)

820
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,550
That was so close.

821
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,760
- You lost.
 -  Just one more.

822
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,490
You were one balloon short.

823
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,590
That was so close.

824
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,960
You were one balloon slower.

825
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,260
- It was 0.3 second faster.
 -  Robots are not humans.

826
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,190
- Ji Hyo is a human.
 -  That was so close.

827
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,290
That was close.

828
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,560
That was so close.

829
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,060
I thought you'd actually make it.

830
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,090
That's too bad.

831
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,590
(The robotic arm is victorious once again.)

832
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,420
- I will give it a try.
 -  Okay.

833
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,790
- Come on!
 -  Let's go.

834
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,190
- You can do it.
 -  Go, Jae Seok.

835
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,420
You have good posture.

836
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,990
Get ready...

837
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,990
(Can Jae Seok beat the robotic arm this time?)

838
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,690
(The match begins.)

839
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,290
(Who will be victorious? A skilled man or a precise machine?)

840
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,220
(What was that?)

841
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,390
(A balloon came out from the back.)

842
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,690
(The balloon came out from the back.)

843
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,920
(It continuously comes out from behind.)

844
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,960
(What is the truth behind these mysterious balloons?)

845
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,020
(It was you.)

846
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,890
(Kwang Soo is more cruel than the robotic arm.)

847
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,760
(You can have as many balloons as you want, Jae Seok.)

848
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,960
(A human's enemy is another human.)

849
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,090
(The robotic arm is victorious.)

850
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,690
What was that?

851
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,590
Why were there so many balloons?

852
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,180
(It was just your imagination.)

853
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,120
No, there were 30 balloons.

854
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,560
There were too many balloons.

855
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,690
Only 30 balloons came out.

856
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,920
(The balloons seemed to be never-ending.)

857
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,020
(More balloons come out.)

858
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,490
(Kwang Soo is the master of trickery.)

859
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,620
What are you doing?

860
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,560
Come here.

861
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,660
What are you doing here?

862
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
(Screaming)

863
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,660
No, wait! It really hurts!

864
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,770
Hold on! Wait!

865
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,790
No! Wait!

866
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,120
Why isn't anyone helping me?

867
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,160
I will do it!

868
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,590
- Come out.
 -  I will go out.

869
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,150
(Kwang Soo is taught a lesson.)

870
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,460
Are you serious?

871
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,890
How can you do this?

872
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,960
I won't do it any more.

873
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,260
It's too late.

874
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,020
- How dare he?
 -  He thought you'd win without it.

875
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,660
All right. No more foul plays from now on.

876
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
(No more foul plays)

877
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,580
I promise. There will be no more.

878
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,790
All right. Who's next?

879
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,390
Tae Hyun is next.

880
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,890
(Tae Hyun versus the robotic arm)

881
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,890
Ready, set...

882
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,120
(Start)

883
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,290
He has a decent chance.

884
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,320
(He is slender.)

885
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,190
I wanted to be an athlete.

886
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,390
Many people gave me offers.

887
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,490
- Really?
 -  What kind of sports?

888
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,990
Baseball, football,

889
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,090
- He's multi-talented.
 -  MMA, aikido, taekwondo and more.

890
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,790
(Tae Hyun, the talented athlete.)

891
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,000
- He can do it.
 -  The balloons are in the front.

892
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,490
There you go. He's fast.

893
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,260
They will come out fast.

894
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,890
Nice.

895
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,290
He is quick.

896
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,760
(He is faster than the robotic arm.)

897
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,960
(How will he handle the swarm of balloons?)

898
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,360
What's wrong with his face?

899
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,660
- Look at him.
 -  Tae Hyun, control your face!

900
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,990
(He can't control his facial expressions any more.)

901
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,990
There goes Tae Hyun.

902
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,690
Control your face!

903
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,420
He's actually doing well. He might make it.

904
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,950
(Will he...)

905
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,790
(succeed?)

906
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,560
(I'll show you the potential of humans.)

907
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,890
(A skilled athletic man versus a precise machine)

908
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,470
(Extraordinary)

909
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,890
- You are almost there.
 -  Come on.

910
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,790
(Nam Tae Hyun wins.)

911
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,090
- Wow.
 -  Amazing.

912
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,780
(Nam Tae Hyun is victorious.)

913
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,160
You are amazing.

914
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,560
(Tae Hyun did the impossible.)

915
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,060
He was really quick.

916
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,280
- Tae Hyun.
 -  Yes?

917
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,520
Everything was good except for your face.

918
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,860
He was fighting like a middle school girl.

919
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,490
(It's how a typical middle school girl fights.)

920
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,870
"Go away!"

921
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,220
Gosh...

922
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,020
Tae Hyun is the only one who succeeded.

923
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,350
I'm jealous.

924
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,890
- Thank you.
 -  Gosh...

925
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,890
(Tae Hyun has six coins, and he's currently the front-runner.)

926
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,790
- Are you ready, Min Ho?
 -  I am ready.

927
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,620
- I will show you what wrapping is.
 -  Let's go!

928
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,120
- He's the wrapping genius.
 -  Check it out!

929
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,060
- Don't use up all your strength.
 -  Ready.

930
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,930
(Wrapping robot versus Min Ho)

931
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,560
Let's go!

932
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,430
You are much faster.

933
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,740
- Yes, that's it. That's good.
 -  Wrapping, wrapping!

934
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,190
- I will never fall down.
 -  He's fast.

935
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,390
- Wrapping.
 -  You're doing well.

936
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,980
(Min Ho went around twice while the robot went around once.)

937
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,990
(Will Song Min Ho win?)

938
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,090
I am tired.

939
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,320
You can't be tired yet!

940
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,390
I'm tired. Wait.

941
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,120
- You went around three times now.
 -  No, no.

942
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,560
- I am so dizzy.
 -  Hey! Hey!

943
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,980
- Keep going.
 -  I am so dizzy.

944
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,430
(Struggling)

945
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,660
I am too dizzy.

946
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,790
- You can do it.
 -  This is too tough.

947
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,360
(We never imagined him to be that weak.)

948
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,320
- You can do it.
 -  Min Ho, one more round!

949
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,490
- The robot is too strong.
 -  That's it.

950
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,790
That's good, that's good.

951
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,120
(The wrapping robot gets ahead of Min Ho.)

952
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,790
Let's go. You have to go now.

953
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,860
(The machine doesn't get tired.)

954
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,850
(Screaming)

955
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,220
You can do it. You can do it.

956
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,520
(He got worn out after going around five times.)

957
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,190
- I can't do it.
 -  You have to do it.

958
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,760
(Laughing)

959
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,560
- This is no joke!
 -  He's so weak!

960
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,060
- This is too tiring!
 -  Go! Go, Min Ho!

961
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,190
I have weak endurance!

962
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,430
Get up, you punk!

963
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,290
- I have weak endurance!
 -  Get up!

964
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,430
Get up!

965
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,430
(It's just that I am scared.)

966
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,890
Come on!

967
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,790
It's the 20th round.

968
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,460
(The machine went around 20 times.)

969
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,890
- It's over.
 -  It's over.

970
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,660
(The machine wins.)

971
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,690
It's crazy, isn't it?

972
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,720
(How can they beat this monster?)

973
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,190
This is the worst situation I had imagined.

974
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,790
(He's the last man standing.)

975
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,260
We can't possibly beat it.

976
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,890
(We can never beat machines.)

977
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,590
It doesn't make sense.

978
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,430
(Humans get tired,)

979
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:40,160
(but the machines never rest.)

980
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,820
(It makes a thundering noise, and its accuracy gives us the chills.)

981
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,060
(It's the moment humans feel weak.)

982
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,560
It doesn't make sense.

983
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,990
(Can humans never beat the machines?)

984
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,260
Now, I will show you how I wrap!

985
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,020
- Ready.
 -  Go, Gary!

986
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,060
(Wrapping robot versus Gary)

987
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,930
Show us how you wrap!

988
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,590
Show us how you wrap!

989
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,220
- You are too fast.
 -  I need to get a head start.

990
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,990
You have to do it fast in the beginning.

991
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,360
- Great. That's it.
 -  The robot catches up soon.

992
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,760
Your speed is perfect.

993
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,490
That's good.

994
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,360
- It's a stamina fight.
 -  Lower your body more.

995
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,060
You have to go even lower.

996
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,390
Yes. Just keep walking.

997
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,820
(But the machine is not stirred by it.)

998
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,390
A little bit more.

999
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,610
- Is this a penalty?
 -  A little bit lower.

1000
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,190
Lower your body more. I will push you.

1001
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,360
- My bottom hurts!
 -  I know, I know.

1002
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,960
(Time passes.)

1003
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,330
- You have to go lower.
 -  10.

1004
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,680
15.

1005
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,930
This is the 15th round.

1006
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,990
Hey.

1007
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,860
Just run three more rounds.

1008
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,930
- Go. Come on.
 -  Go, Gary!

1009
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,190
- Just three rounds.
 -  That's great!

1010
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,360
You have to win, Gary!

1011
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,960
(Humans get tired more easily than machines.)

1012
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,720
(But humans encourage each other.)

1013
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,250
- You went around 17 times.
 -  How many left?

1014
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,390
Three rounds.

1015
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,620
(And they become stronger.)

1016
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,660
You have three more rounds to go.

1017
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,360
Gather the last bits of your strength!

1018
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,690
(Here I go!)

1019
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,390
Gather the last bits of your strength!

1020
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,360
Take your time. You have to do it right.

1021
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,910
(Whenever he takes a step,)

1022
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,860
(his colleagues cheer him up.)

1023
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,660
- It's the last round.
 -  Lower your body more.

1024
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,110
(There is a magical power about doing things together.)

1025
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,720
(But machines will never understand it.)

1026
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,990
This is 19. It's the last round, Gary.

1027
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,210
- It's the last round.
 -  It's the last. Do it well.

1028
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,560
It's the last round.

1029
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,990
Lower your body more.

1030
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,090
- I'm done!
 -  That's it!

1031
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,930
(Gary finishes the last round.)

1032
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,290
(Gary arrives first and wins.)

1033
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,910
You won.

1034
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,090
- It really hurts, doesn't it?
 -  Good job.

1035
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,390
(The human wrappers check on Gary first.)

1036
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,660
The game is over.

1037
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,120
You successfully completed the mission.

1038
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,490
Each of you gets two coins.

1039
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,260
Gosh, that was tiring.

1040
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,390
- Wait. Where do we go next?
 -  Where is "Path"?

1041
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,490
Path is...

1042
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,560
- Should we go with Path?
 -  Yes.

1043
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,720
- Wait, Hyeri. It's...
 -  Sarihyeon-dong.

1044
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,150
I will look for it.

1045
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,590
- Okay. You look for it then.
 -  Okay.

1046
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,860
(Groaning)

1047
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,220
(Does she have cavities?)

1048
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,960
Should I take a look?

1049
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,360
(Jae Seok wants to check the map.)

1050
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,060
Thank you, Hyeri. I will check the map.

1051
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,590
They don't even have the address.

1052
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,620
They're trying to follow us.

1053
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,790
- They don't know about the map.
 -  They don't.

1054
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,690
Where did the map go? I put it here.

1055
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,660
Ji Hyo said she put it here.

1056
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,720
- Is this a different car?
 -  This is the right car.

1057
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,660
Where did it go? Where did the map go?

1058
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,120
(10 minutes before they moved the car)

1059
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,290
Where did they put it?

1060
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:30,690
(Tae Hyun stole the map from Team Seok Jin's car.)

1061
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,020
(He knows how to keep another team in check.)

1062
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,890
- Should we go there?
 -  Yes.

1063
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,890
- I think they will be kind.
 -  Okay. Let's check.

1064
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,960
They are going to ask.

1065
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,620
Should we go steal their map?

1066
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,720
- Let's go get their map.
 -  Let's steal their map.

1067
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,860
Did they take the map?

1068
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,620
- Make a U-turn and...
 -  I will go get their map.

1069
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,120
(They are planning to steal Team Jae Seok's map.)

1070
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,390
- They're out.
 -  They're out.

1071
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,760
- What's wrong?
 -  They're out.

1072
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,690
Okay.

1073
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,320
They don't even bother to get out of the car.

1074
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,460
(What's going on?)

1075
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,160
(Kwang Soo appears.)

1076
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,990
Tae Hyun, do you have that?

1077
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,760
Wait.

1078
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,490
(We don't feel like talking right now.)

1079
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,190
(Give me back my map!)

1080
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,220
It's right here.

1081
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,360
(Giggling)

1082
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,520
They sensed it.

1083
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,120
Sense what?

1084
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,390
- That you are trying to steal?
 -  They sensed it.

1085
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,460
- Get in first.
 -  Let's get going.

1086
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,120
We missed the timing.

1087
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,690
- We should've moved faster.
 -  Why don't we have a map?

1088
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,940
It's 764 Janghang-dong.

1089
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,890
(Will they be able to find the place with the address?)

1090
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,830
What's this place?

1091
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,560
It was so tough to find this place.

1092
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,760
How can people find this place?

1093
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,320
It's a studio.

1094
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,760
(What is the truth behind the hint, Path?)

1095
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,460
- I'm curious.
 -  Who owns this place?

1096
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,790
(Gary's surprised.)

1097
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,020
What's this?

1098
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,090
- Are we the first to come here?
 -  What's this?

1099
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,060
There's a blindfold. What's this?

1100
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,260
- It's a maze.
 -  It's a maze?

1101
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,720
We have to find the path!

1102
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,190
This time, you will compete with a machine...

1103
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,060
to escape a maze.

1104
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,660
(It's a maze escaping match!)

1105
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
All right.

1106
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,220
Please bring out the opponent.

1107
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,390
(Which robot will be playing this time?)

1108
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,720
(What? Where is it coming from?)

1109
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,760
(The door opens.)

1110
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,590
(Is it coming out from there?)

1111
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,560
(It's a robot vacuum.)

1112
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,620
(In 2001, a Swedish vacuum company invented it.)

1113
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,690
(Using the cameras on all sides, it checks where to clean.)

1114
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,430
(It can clean the areas underneath sofas and beds, too.)

1115
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,160
(Its auto-escape function enables it to escape from obstacles.)

1116
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,190
(Its maximum speed is 35cm per second.)

1117
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,620
(It's very cute.)

1118
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,270
It hurts my pride.

1119
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,660
It does hurt my pride.

1120
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,290
The robot vacuum will try to escape the maze.

1121
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,560
If you escape the maze faster than the robot, you will win.

1122
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,260
But you will have to keep your eyes covered.

1123
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,390
Okay.

1124
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,220
Let's do that.

1125
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,300
(Smirking)

1126
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,820
(Don't you think you are underestimating us?)

1127
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,120
- We could memorise the path.
 -  We could.

1128
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,290
(They are very confident.)

1129
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,810
(They check every corner of the maze.)

1130
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:37,290
(It would be too easy if they could memorise the path.)

1131
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,960
Don't you think it's too complicated?

1132
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,790
- Wait.
 -  Gosh...

1133
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,860
(They can't memorise it.)

1134
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,850
(Robot vacuum will do a simulation of its performance.)

1135
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,980
Come over here, cute.

1136
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,620
(The cute robot vacuum starts.)

1137
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,390
What can it do?

1138
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,290
(It moves forward with composure.)

1139
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,060
(It senses a wall...)

1140
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,660
(and makes a left turn right away.)

1141
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,500
It's good.

1142
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,920
- It finds its way around well.
 -  I can't believe it.

1143
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,690
It's good.

1144
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,760
- Is someone controlling it?
 -  I know.

1145
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
- How can it follow the path?
 -  How can it avoid the dead ends?

1146
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,890
We can't be easy on it.

1147
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,120
It's fascinating.

1148
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,130
We can memorise the path, right?

1149
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,190
- Sure.
 -  I memorised it.

1150
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,720
- This is easy.
 -  Right.

1151
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,050
But I memorised the entire path.

1152
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,720
I memorised the entire path. Is that okay?

1153
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,790
Then we will start from the other side.

1154
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,760
(No way.)

1155
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,620
You are smart, aren't you?

1156
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,920
I didn't think of that.

1157
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,460
(His plan is ruined.)

1158
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,690
I didn't think of that either.

1159
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,890
(No wonder it was so easy to remember.)

1160
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,790
My head hurts all of a sudden.

1161
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,990
(Robot vacuum versus Gary)

1162
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,190
- Ready.
 -  Go, Gary!

1163
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,090
- Go, Gary!
 -  Good luck!

1164
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
(Start)

1165
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Okay.

1166
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,360
- It must be scary though.
 -  It must be.

1167
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:04,410
(The human has to use his senses to move forward.)

1168
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,820
This is really tough!

1169
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,260
Gosh! Where am I?

1170
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,220
(To make it fair, both of them can rely on only one sense.)

1171
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,190
(They are moving at a similar speed.)

1172
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,360
I can't go as fast as I thought.

1173
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,220
(Gary is on the bottom, and the robot is on the top.)

1174
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,790
(The robot vacuum makes a smooth turn around a corner.)

1175
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,160
(Gary is using his arms as his antennas.)

1176
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,720
Hey! Wait!

1177
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,820
- Is it tough, Gary?
 -  This is...

1178
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,020
(Gary loses his confidence.)

1179
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,420
This is crazy. This is no joke.

1180
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,090
(Gary struggles.)

1181
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,090
This is crazy.

1182
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,160
(He doesn't know the path.)

1183
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,420
If I get lost once, that will be it for me. Wait.

1184
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,590
(He sounds pitiful.)

1185
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,560
Should I go forward?

1186
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,690
(He's moving towards a dead end.)

1187
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,990
Gosh... This is crazy.

1188
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,390
What's this?

1189
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,420
Wait.

1190
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
(It's funny.)

1191
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,790
It has to be a straight path.

1192
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,390
Hey!

1193
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,020
I am in trouble! Haha!

1194
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,390
Min Ho! I am in great trouble!

1195
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,160
(Bye, Gary!)

1196
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,660
(The game is over.)

1197
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,090
- Just walk towards the exit.
 -  It's over.

1198
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,360
We lost again.

1199
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,490
- The time is up.
 -  It's really tough.

1200
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,520
Where am I?

1201
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,560
If I get lost once, that will be the end.

1202
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,560
It's really tough. It's tougher than you think.

1203
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,920
(Next human player is Min Ho.)

1204
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,890
- Ready.
 -  Wait!

1205
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,460
Wait!

1206
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,360
Ready.

1207
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,190
(Min Ho crawls fast.)

1208
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,990
(He hits a wall.)

1209
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,020
(The human player is fast this time.)

1210
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,200
Yes. This is it.

1211
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,590
(He's not afraid to hit walls.)

1212
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,590
This way.

1213
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
What is it?

1214
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,520
(The robot vacuum is moving stably at a constant speed.)

1215
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,990
Gosh, this is...

1216
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,960
(He hits all the walls.)

1217
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,730
Okay! I have a good feeling!

1218
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,820
Go, Min Ho!

1219
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,020
Come here.

1220
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,450
(Team Jae Seok enters the mission place, too.)

1221
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,420
(Hyeri guides him with her voice.)

1222
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,060
(Floundering)

1223
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,160
(The human is on the left, and the robot is on the right.)

1224
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,220
You're doing great.

1225
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,540
- Great!
 -  I'm feeling good about this!

1226
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,560
You can do this.

1227
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,220
(He's better than me.)

1228
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,920
Where is this?

1229
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,690
Wait.

1230
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,290
(The left side is a short cut, and the right side is a trap.)

1231
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,220
(Will he go to the right?)

1232
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,760
(He chooses to go to the left!)

1233
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,560
I think I found the path!

1234
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,590
(His confidence shoots up.)

1235
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,820
He's amazing.

1236
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,660
- Is he a genius?
 -  Was I right?

1237
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,490
You were right.

1238
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,260
I am just following my gut feeling.

1239
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,390
- He's really good.
 -  He's very precise.

1240
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,790
I can hear your voices.

1241
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,890
Okay. I know the way out from here.

1242
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,060
Wow. A young man is different.

1243
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,660
(He hits a wall.)

1244
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,720
That's it.

1245
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,990
(Youth is painful.)

1246
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,860
(The robot is playing the game mechanically.)

1247
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,720
Min Ho! Move back a little!

1248
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,240
- Okay.
 -  You have to move back a little!

1249
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,290
We can hear him from here.

1250
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,360
(He desperately tries to win.)

1251
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,960
- You can come here.
 -  I'm so exhausted!

1252
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,420
(The robot exit is on the bottom, and the human exit is on the top.)

1253
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,860
(They are both near the finishing line!)

1254
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,490
(It's Song Min Ho versus...)

1255
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,460
(cute robot vacuum.)

1256
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,120
(Which of them will be...)

1257
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,620
(the final...)

1258
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,490
(winner?)

1259
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,660
That's crazy.

1260
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,120
(They're both so close.)

1261
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,360
- No way!
 -  Wow!

1262
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,710
(Song Min Ho wins!)

1263
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,810
Bravo.

1264
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,630
(Song Min Ho wins!)

1265
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,190
Success! I did it!

1266
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,690
The robot did bad!

1267
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,320
How did you get out?

1268
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,460
That was crazy.

1269
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,020
- How did you do that?
 -  He knew the path.

1270
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,860
- I just followed my feeling.
 -  That doesn't work though.

1271
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,420
Did you memorise the path?

1272
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,090
I remembered the path around the middle.

1273
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,220
Is that right?

1274
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,860
We have to give it a try, too.

1275
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,860
(It's Hyeri's turn now.)

1276
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,260
I can't see anything. I have no idea.

1277
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,460
- Gosh...
 -  Gosh...

1278
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,310
No way! She succeeded!

1279
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,980
(Hyeri succeeds!)

1280
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,260
- We'll do it.
 -  You should speed up a little.

1281
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,760
Why am I out of breath?

1282
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,160
Why is he so slow?

1283
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,390
- Hurry up!
 -  I did it!

1284
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,420
(Time's over)

1285
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,520
(Currently, Min Ho has the most number of coins.)

1286
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,520
(Finally)

1287
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
What's this?

1288
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,510
I hate getting plunged.

1289
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,720
Are we getting plunged again?

1290
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,720
I am scared.

1291
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
It's really scary.

1292
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,420
- It's horrifying.
 -  I am really scared.

1293
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,220
(The grand stadium for the last match.)

1294
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,860
Jong Kook, who is currently in China,

1295
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,620
also competed against machines...

1296
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,720
while you were doing the same here.

1297
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,790
He competed against three machines we use all the time.

1298
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,960
How do you think it turned out?

1299
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,790
- Please make a guess and vote.
 -  I think he won by 2 to 1.

1300
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,690
I think it's either this or that.

1301
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,760
And...

1302
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
I think it's either 2 to 1 or 1 to 1.

1303
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,720
- We have to guess it right to win.
 -  Yes.

1304
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,820
What's the result?

1305
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,390
The first match was juicer versus Jong Kook.

1306
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,960
The first machine you will fight against is...

1307
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,520
- a juicer.
 -  Okay.

1308
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,260
The one who produces a cup of juice first will win.

1309
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,690
You have to fill the cup until the line.

1310
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,230
- Okay.
 -  Ready.

1311
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,720
(Who will be the winner?)

1312
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,860
(It's a juicing match.)

1313
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,960
Start.

1314
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,490
(The match starts.)

1315
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,420
(Grunting)

1316
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,790
(Grunts versus machine noises)

1317
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,690
(It's a time of ordeal for oranges.)

1318
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,690
(It's a competition between Jong Kook's momentary power...)

1319
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,960
(and the juicer's consistent power.)

1320
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,120
It's getting all over my hands.

1321
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,090
(Squeezing)

1322
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,960
(Juicing)

1323
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,260
(It's nearing the end.)

1324
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,790
Okay! I am done!

1325
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,120
(What is the result?)

1326
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Stop.

1327
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,490
I'm done, right?

1328
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,260
I knew it. You machine...

1329
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,760
A machine can't beat a human.

1330
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,760
(Does he believe in humanism?)

1331
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,820
Jong Kook won.

1332
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,960
(Three people are out.)

1333
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,060
- Jong Kook won?
 -  Jong Kook won.

1334
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,760
- How can you beat a juicer?
 -  He's mad.

1335
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,260
- Does it make sense?
 -  He could do it.

1336
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,820
How could he beat a juicer?

1337
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,860
He had to juice oranges.

1338
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,090
- That doesn't make sense.
 -  He's not a human.

1339
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,120
How can you beat a juicer?

1340
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,560
Don't you think he needs a drug test?

1341
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,720
Are you sure he's not a machine?

1342
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,840
- No way.
 -  And then?

1343
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,320
The second match was AI Alkkagi versus Jong Kook.

1344
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,960
I'm sure the machine won.

1345
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,820
(Did Jong Kook win this match, too?)

1346
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,960
- The game...
 -  Jong Kook won.

1347
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,790
(Some are thrilled, and some are devastated.)

1348
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,990
- How did he do that?
 -  We did it!

1349
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,760
- We guessed it right!
 -  What happened?

1350
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,620
Everyone's gone.

1351
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,560
Yes! This is amazing.

1352
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,020
- This is unbelievable.
 -  I hope he won all three.

1353
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,920
- I made a wrong guess.
 -  I hope he won all the matches.

1354
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,160
- Right.
 -  Tae Hyun will be the only winner.

1355
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,960
- The last match was blender...
 -  It's a blender this time.

1356
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,390
- versus Jong Kook.
 -  That's impossible.

1357
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,190
(Blender versus Jong Kook)

1358
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,720
(So many...)

1359
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,820
(coins...)

1360
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,220
(depend on this!)

1361
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,260
The blender won.

1362
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,020
(The machine won the last match.)

1363
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,390
- I did it!
 -  Gosh...

1364
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,460
- Song Min Ho wins!
 -  Yes!

1365
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,320
He guessed well.

1366
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,990
- I should've followed Min Ho.
 -  That's unbelievable!

1367
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,160
- You should've followed me.
 -  Then that's four.

1368
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,190
(Gary and Min Ho get 4 coins each.)

1369
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,290
- Min Ho has 18 coins now!
 -  He already has a lot.

1370
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,860
Min Ho is unbelievable.

1371
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,290
(Min Ho is winning with 18 coins.)

1372
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,820
- That was crazy.
 -  I think I have seven coins.

1373
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,600
- He hit the jackpot.
 -  I have nine.

1374
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,760
- You will play the final game.
 -  I am really bad at it.

1375
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,090
It's called AI Kungkungtta.

1376
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,290
- AI?
 -  You'll play the word chain game.

1377
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,120
- How can we beat a computer?
 -  How can we win?

1378
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,460
(Word chain game with a computer)

1379
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,420
(How can we beat a computer?)

1380
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,560
On your right, there are...

1381
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,320
lanes from 1 to 9.

1382
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,960
But you have different options.

1383
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,590
You can change directions, or if you get a difficult word,

1384
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,320
you can attack another person.

1385
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,590
You can also get help from a news anchor.

1386
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,720
- There are many option cards.
 -  I'll just attack.

1387
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,820
- Me, too.
 -  Me, too.

1388
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,660
That'll help us eliminate someone.

1389
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,720
I need that.

1390
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,690
(The members have obtained different kinds of chances.)

1391
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,060
(They each stand on a lane.)

1392
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,460
Running Man declared the final war against machines.

1393
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,320
This is the final match, Kungkungtta.

1394
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,290
Artificial Intelligence Kungkungtta!

1395
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,320
(AI Kungkungtta)

1396
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,260
- Hello.
 -  I will win!

1397
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,120
When I discussed with the crew,

1398
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,560
they thought Jae Seok had the best chance of winning.

1399
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,760
That's not true. I will eliminate either Kwang Soo or Seok Jin...

1400
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,090
before I get eliminated.

1401
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,790
- Why would you do that?
 -  Which chance did you choose?

1402
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,460
I will get eliminated anyway even if you don't do that.

1403
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,220
On the other hand, they chose Kwang Soo as the best loser.

1404
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,390
- Me?
 -  Yes.

1405
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,460
I'm a bookworm.

1406
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,290
You're not holding anything in your hands.

1407
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,420
I have a dictionary.

1408
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,420
- A dictionary?
 -  Yes.

1409
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,620
I have two dictionary chances.

1410
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,620
- Do you have two?
 -  Yes.

1411
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,990
Now, let me introduce your opponent.

1412
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,890
It's an artificial intelligence programme.

1413
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,520
Let's meet the opponent.

1414
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,820
(Their last opponent is revealed.)

1415
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,360
(Emerging)

1416
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,060
(What is it now?)

1417
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
Let's meet the opponent.

1418
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,220
(It looks mysterious.)

1419
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,320
(This is the final opponent.)

1420
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,690
(Marvelling)

1421
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,690
- That's a laptop.
 -  Its name is...

1422
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,030
J-bot. It's four years old.

1423
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,070
It was born on August 18,

1424
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,560
- 2013.
 -  Is that right?

1425
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,580
- It's the same age as my son.
 -  I see.

1426
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,020
Based on the standard dictionary,

1427
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,000
this artificial intelligence programme...

1428
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,520
- can play word games.
 -  We can't beat it.

1429
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,890
I'm getting nervous.

1430
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,420
- I'm nervous.
 -  If you fail to put in a word,

1431
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,170
you'll be eliminated.

1432
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,860
If you win, you'll move onto the next stage.

1433
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:36,070
Until we have a final survivor,

1434
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,620
the match between humans and the artificial intelligence...

1435
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,790
will continue.

1436
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,090
I'm getting nervous.

1437
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,090
Will someone beat artificial intelligence?

1438
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,790
They'll compete against artificial intelligence in a word game.

1439
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:51,660
The final game, AI Kungkungtta,

1440
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,290
begins now.

1441
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:57,190
(Ai Kungkungtta begins now.)

1442
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,920
- What's that sound?
 -  You silly thing.

1443
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,660
The match starts now.

1444
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,790
Jae Seok, write your word.

1445
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,860
I'm getting nervous.

1446
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,320
You shouldn't start with a word that will end the game.

1447
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,790
It's your first word. Make a careful choice.

1448
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,960
Pick something difficult.

1449
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,010
All right.

1450
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,990
He's taking his time.

1451
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,820
(It's not easy to pick a word.)

1452
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,190
- He wrote "Summer".
 -  "Summer".

1453
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,660
(He enters the first word.)

1454
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,220
- "Summer".
 -  That's hard.

1455
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,420
- "Summer".
 -  It wrote "Remuneration".

1456
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,390
- Is that a word?
 -  With the word "Remuneration",

1457
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,620
J-bot counter attacked.

1458
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,890
- "Remuneration"?
 -  What does that mean?

1459
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,020
Is that even a word?

1460
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,660
Is there such a word?

1461
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm nervous!

1462
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,230
"Remuneration".

1463
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,290
What does that mean?

1464
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,140
- I've never heard of it.
 -  It's my first time hearing it.

1465
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,290
It's similar in meaning to "Wage".

1466
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,810
- I never heard it.
 -  It's Min Ho's turn now.

1467
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,920
- Choose your word.
 -  Can we use the dictionary?

1468
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,960
You have 30 seconds.

1469
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,160
- Brass...
 -  Brass, bronze...

1470
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,120
I'm not sure.

1471
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,920
- "Brass-copper".
 -  What's that?

1472
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,220
- "Brass-copper".
 -  I know it.

1473
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,160
Enter it if you're sure.

1474
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,660
I think it's a word.

1475
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,790
I've never heard it before.

1476
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,310
Okay.

1477
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,700
I've never heard it before.

1478
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,420
- It says, "Please enter a noun."
 -  You made a mistake.

1479
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,990
- He failed one time.
 -  Was he confused?

1480
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,220
If you make another mistake...

1481
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,820
(He passed with "Brass".)

1482
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,970
(What a relief.)

1483
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,690
J-bot entered "Verb".

1484
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,060
It's Gary's turn.

1485
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,600
What will he write?

1486
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,620
"Selfishness".

1487
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,290
"Selfishness".

1488
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,560
- "Personalism"?
 -  "Personalism"?

1489
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,990
- J-bot counter attacked...
 -  Is that a real word?

1490
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,150
with "Personalism".

1491
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,620
Is there such a word?

1492
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,920
- A word that starts with Deok?
 -  "Deok Seon".

1493
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,060
I thought of that, too.

1494
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,180
How about "Nerd".

1495
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,560
He has to come up with a word...

1496
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,620
- that starts with "Deok".
 -  This has nothing...

1497
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,720
- to do with my will.
 -  This one's hard.

1498
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,500
Haha seems nervous.

1499
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,560
- "Deok".
 -  It's hard.

1500
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,690
You have 30 seconds.

1501
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:46,920
Write "Deok Seon".

1502
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,820
- Write "Deok Seon".
 -  I can't think of anything else.

1503
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,160
Deok is hard.

1504
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,660
Won't "Nerd" work?

1505
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,960
(He's unsure.)

1506
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,320
- Should I try?
 -  I think it'll count.

1507
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,970
- I think it will.
 -  You can try.

1508
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,320
- "That word does not exist."
 -  Goodness.

1509
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,220
(J-bot is strict.)

1510
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,090
- It's not a word.
 -  That word does not exist.

1511
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,150
All right.

1512
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,420
- It's artificial intelligence.
 -  You have to do well.

1513
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,600
- It's your last chance.
 -  J-bot knows what it's doing.

1514
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,690
You can use your chance if you want...

1515
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,790
- or just give up.
 -  "Nerd" was hilarious.

1516
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,190
- How could he write that?
 -  You have 30 seconds.

1517
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,760
Oh, right.

1518
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,460
All right.

1519
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,460
"Deoksugung" worked.

1520
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,690
"Deoksugung".

1521
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,460
- It worked.
 -  You were running out of time.

1522
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,260
- It worked.
 -  J-bot entered "Distress".

1523
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,420
- "Distress".
 -  It managed this time, too.

1524
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,910
- The word is "Distress".
 -  What does it mean?

1525
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,270
- "Distress".
 -  Is it "Tae"?

1526
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,520
Write "Legend".

1527
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,880
"Legend"?

1528
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,320
Write "King".

1529
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,500
Write "Tae Jin Ah".

1530
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,610
- Hyeri entered "Sun".
 -  "Sun".

1531
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,920
- "Ear".
 -  J-bot entered "Ear".

1532
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,520
It's Tae Hyun's turn. If you're not sure...

1533
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,920
- Can I write anything?
 -  what the word means,

1534
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,390
- click on the word...
 -  He's so serious.

1535
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,820
- and read its meaning.
 -  He's focused.

1536
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,860
Keep that in mind.

1537
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,190
- "Ghost".
 -  "Singyeongi"?

1538
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,260
- "Singyeongi"?
 -  What's that?

1539
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,560
What does that mean?

1540
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,560
It wrote "Singyeongi".

1541
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,690
- Is that a word?
 -  That's right.

1542
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,810
"Singyeongi".

1543
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,530
"Singyeongi"...

1544
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,320
is a name of a plant.

1545
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,690
It must be similar to "Jilgyeongi".

1546
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,100
It's Ji Hyo's turn.

1547
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,890
You have 30 seconds.

1548
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,420
- What?
 -  Will that work?

1549
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,130
- I'm sure it will.
 -  "Tooth".

1550
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,210
- Does that work?
 -  "Tooth".

1551
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,190
- "Basin"?
 -  By writing "Basin",

1552
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,620
- What's that?
 -  J-bot counter attacked.

1553
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,190
It wrote so many difficult words.

1554
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,770
It's Kwang Soo's turn now.

1555
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:17,820
Write "Meal".

1556
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,920
- "Meal".
 -  "Palm".

1557
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,140
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1558
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,820
- "Jacob".
 -  Hey.

1559
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,020
J-bot entered "Product set"...

1560
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,490
to counter attack.

1561
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,890
Seok Jin.

1562
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:35,820
(How will Seok Jin fight back?)

1563
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,290
"Union".

1564
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,790
(Seok Jin got a hint from J-bot.)

1565
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,720
Seok Jin wrote "Union".

1566
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,160
Next is "Legitimacy".

1567
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,090
What does that mean?

1568
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,790
- It returned back to him.
 -  J-bot counter attacked.

1569
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,320
Seok Jin, it's your turn again.

1570
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,500
Go ahead.

1571
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,820
I can't think of a word.

1572
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,090
Go ahead.

1573
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,520
- You're running out of time.
 -  You have no time.

1574
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,190
- All right.
 -  Go ahead.

1575
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,410
You have 10 seconds left.

1576
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,260
In 10, 9,

1577
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,790
eight,

1578
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,160
- Where's the cursor?
 -  seven,

1579
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,560
- Where's the cursor?
 -  six, five,

1580
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,990
- Just write anything.
 -  four,

1581
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,290
(Seok Jin forgot to move the cursor.)

1582
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,520
(Will he fail?)

1583
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,800
- Just write anything.
 -  Four,

1584
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,820
three...

1585
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,420
- "Red".
 -  Okay.

1586
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
(Red)

1587
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:16,790
- It's your turn.
 -  "Saxophone"?

1588
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,120
- "Phone"?
 -  It counter attacked.

1589
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,720
- It has to start with "Phone".
 -  I once lost because of "Phone".

1590
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,720
- "Phone"?
 -  Is there anything?

1591
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,560
He's in trouble.

1592
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,460
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't write a compound word.

1593
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,820
- "Phone case".
 -  Will it work?

1594
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,890
- "Phone case".
 -  "Phone case".

1595
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,420
- It's a compound word.
 -  Try it.

1596
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,520
- Try it.
 -  Go ahead.

1597
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,490
It's a crisis.

1598
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,620
Dictionary chance!

1599
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,060
(Kwang Soo wants to use a chance.)

1600
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,110
Dictionary chance.

1601
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,420
You can search the dictionary, starting now.

1602
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,520
Will it be enough time?

1603
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,190
- How much time does he have?
 -  He has one minute.

1604
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,560
I don't think there's any word.

1605
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,090
- Find a word in the dictionary.
 -  There's nothing.

1606
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,910
- I can't believe this.
 -  Is there a time limit?

1607
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,460
He has one minute.

1608
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,060
He has one minute.

1609
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,460
- He is looking now.
 -  I don't think there's one.

1610
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,290
(Kwang Soo is fighting against artificial intelligence.)

1611
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,060
(He's been flipping through the dictionary for 20 seconds.)

1612
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,220
- Time is running out.
 -  It has to start with "Phone".

1613
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,460
There's no "Phone"!

1614
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,360
(There's nothing.)

1615
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,860
There's no word that starts with "Phone"!

1616
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,720
Gosh.

1617
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,690
I have two dictionary chances, but they're of no use!

1618
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,190
- Wait!
 -  There's nothing.

1619
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,620
Give me another dictionary! It doesn't have the word.

1620
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,790
- That can't be.
 -  It's true.

1621
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,490
That's the only dictionary we have.

1622
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,420
I'm sorry.

1623
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,320
Is there no word that starts with "Phone"?

1624
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,920
- Is that true?
 -  Kwang Soo, you're doomed.

1625
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,960
Wait.

1626
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,520
"Phone".

1627
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,520
- You have 30 seconds left.
 -  What should I do?

1628
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,150
"Phone".

1629
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,320
- "Phone"...
 -  Is there really nothing?

1630
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,360
(Kwang Soo is unlucky as always.)

1631
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,260
Why do you all look away?

1632
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,220
(Don't look away from me.)

1633
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,360
(They avoid eye contact.)

1634
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,310
- Hey.
 -  "Phone".

1635
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,050
- Isn't there any word?
 -  You have 10 seconds left.

1636
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,620
- In 10,
 -  Oh, no.

1637
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,720
- nine,
 -  You'll be eliminated.

1638
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,420
eight, seven,

1639
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,990
six, five,

1640
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,990
- Just write anything.
 -  four, three,

1641
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:54,420
- "Phones".
 -  two,

1642
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,820
- one.
 -  It's over.

1643
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,820
You're eliminated.

1644
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,890
(It was expected.)

1645
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,660
Kwang Soo is eliminated.

1646
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,660
No, Kwang Soo.

1647
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,190
- Wow.
 -  Oh my goodness.

1648
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,290
Kwang Soo.

1649
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,420
My goodness.

1650
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,390
- It's too early.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1651
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,460
Wait.

1652
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,520
Please stand in the middle.

1653
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,820
No, wait!

1654
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,690
- Kwang Soo.
 -  He didn't use his second chance.

1655
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,820
I have one chance left.

1656
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,060
Please look at me.

1657
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,980
- Bring your arms together.
 -  It's also the dictionary chance.

1658
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,390
Kwang Soo.

1659
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,420
Out.

1660
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:24,120
(The floor opened.)

1661
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,260
Out.

1662
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,900
(He falls.)

1663
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,980
- Kwang Soo has been...
 -  That's scary.

1664
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,460
eliminated.

1665
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,720
(It was scary.)

1666
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,670
Is it scary?

1667
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,690
- Goodness.
 -  It was fast.

1668
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,520
It's so scary.

1669
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,560
Kwang Soo, are you okay?

1670
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,970
He's been eliminated.

1671
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,990
Jae Seok!

1672
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,080
You fall longer than you think.

1673
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,800
It looks quite high.

1674
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,560
I fell for at least four seconds.

1675
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,520
- That's scary.
 -  We can fall on our bottoms.

1676
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,120
Gosh, we survived.

1677
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,950
I'm scared.

1678
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,080
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1679
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,290
Kwang Soo is the first to be eliminated.

1680
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,260
(Kwang Soo is sitting here.)

1681
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,560
- Now...
 -  Do I look stupid?

1682
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,190
- I'm so upset.
 -  This is exactly what...

1683
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,890
- the staff had expected.
 -  "Phone" is hard.

1684
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,460
There is no word for that.

1685
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,450
You could have written "Font".

1686
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,540
- There was that.
 -  That could have worked.

1687
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,860
- "Font"?
 -  The second round...

1688
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,920
will begin.

1689
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,990
(The second round begins.)

1690
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,530
Ji Hyo will start the round.

1691
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,220
Please enter a word.

1692
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,290
- Me?
 -  Yes.

1693
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,420
You can write any word...

1694
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,680
that does not end the game immediately.

1695
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,860
You're lucky to be the first.

1696
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
Write anything.

1697
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,220
Will this work?

1698
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,090
Maybe.

1699
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,720
- It won't count.
 -  It will.

1700
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,660
- Ji Hyo wrote "We".
 -  It knows "Linen"?

1701
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,720
It knows "Linen"?

1702
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,990
- You're in trouble.
 -  J-bot wrote "Linen".

1703
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,620
- Ji Hyo, I'm disappointed in you.
 -  J-bot...

1704
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,650
- Jae Seok.
 -  Tae Hyun!

1705
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,510
- It wasn't intentional.
 -  Tae Hyun.

1706
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,260
Tae Hyun!

1707
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,720
(Come here!)

1708
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,420
- It wasn't intentional.
 -  What should I do?

1709
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,460
- Ji Hyo.
 -  It's unbelievable.

1710
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,520
The difficulty suddenly became higher.

1711
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,520
- It's the computer's fault.
 -  There's no word for "Nen".

1712
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,420
- "Nen"?
 -  The difficulty...

1713
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,160
- went up.
 -  "Linen" is...

1714
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,190
a textile made from the fibres of flax plants.

1715
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,090
- This is hard.
 -  This word is included...

1716
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,290
- in the standard dictionary.
 -  Ji Hyo, you're horrible.

1717
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,190
- Jae Seok.
 -  Think of anything.

1718
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,120
You can use your chances.

1719
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,150
You have to think of a word that starts with "Nen".

1720
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,160
(Rummaging)

1721
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,110
I'll use my chance!

1722
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,410
- I can't think of a word for "Nen".
 -  "Nen"...

1723
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,260
You can use your chance cards.

1724
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,190
It's "Nen".

1725
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,660
(Which chance will he use?)

1726
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,590
(Everything depends on this chance.)

1727
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:34,590
I'll choose change of direction.

1728
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:36,760
- He chose change of direction.
 -  I'll choose change of direction.

1729
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,520
(He changed the direction.)

1730
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,240
- He chose change of direction.
 -  Don't do that!

1731
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,420
- Ji Hyo is up next.
 -  Don't do that.

1732
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,690
Go at each other.

1733
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,790
- That's great.
 -  What word begins with "Nen"?

1734
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,320
- Ji Hyo, please enter a word.
 -  It's coming back to me.

1735
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,420
(How does it feel?)

1736
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,620
Why did you choose change of direction?

1737
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,360
I barely survived just a while ago.

1738
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,840
It's a change of direction.

1739
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,690
I'm sorry. I choose to skip my turn.

1740
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,650
- She chooses to skip her turn.
 -  Is it me?

1741
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,890
(I shouldn't be excited.)

1742
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:04,560
- We will skip her turn.
 -  Is it me?

1743
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,890
- Then...
 -  Is it me?

1744
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,240
Seok Jin will...

1745
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,790
- have to...
 -  Seok Jin, come here.

1746
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,260
- continue.
 -  Come here.

1747
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,590
Because she has skipped her turn.

1748
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,810
- I just had my turn.
 -  Goodness, Ji Hyo.

1749
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,690
That side hardly had their turns.

1750
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,990
- Someone will leave soon.
 -  Please enter a word.

1751
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,790
- How many times...
 -  10.

1752
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,890
- Why is it already 10?
 -  9.

1753
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,260
I just got here.

1754
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,520
The people before you used up the time.

1755
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,860
- It just became my turn.
 -  Ten,

1756
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,490
nine, eight,

1757
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,820
- seven,
 -  What is it?

1758
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,820
- six,
 -  Chance.

1759
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,420
I'd like to look in the dictionary.

1760
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,500
He chose to look in the dictionary.

1761
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,190
- You will have one minute.
 -  Go find it, quick.

1762
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,660
- Look in the dictionary.
 -  I'll bet everything on him losing.

1763
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,420
- It's "Nen".
 -  Why did you...

1764
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,460
- Wait.
 -  It was "We" to "Linen" and now...

1765
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,390
- Where is it?
 -  It must start with "Nen".

1766
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,310
- "Linen" is a difficult word.
 -  Where is it?

1767
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,860
- I've never heard of it.
 -  It's "Nen".

1768
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,700
You have enough time.

1769
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,320
You have 40 seconds remaining.

1770
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,860
You have 40 seconds left.

1771
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:03,590
(Is there nothing?)

1772
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,020
- There's nothing.
 -  Seok Jin.

1773
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,790
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1774
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:11,990
(Laughing)

1775
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,390
(There's no way out.)

1776
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,920
- That chance is of no use.
 -  Seok Jin.

1777
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,390
- Look for "En".
 -  Hey, you.

1778
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,690
- Try "En".
 -  You have 30 seconds left.

1779
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:21,960
What in the world?

1780
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,520
(What is this?)

1781
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,990
I just began.

1782
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,760
You have 20 seconds left.

1783
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,860
- Please wait.
 -  "Nen".

1784
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,920
I'm going to write down anything.

1785
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,790
How do I do this? The cursor.

1786
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,510
- Where's the cursor?
 -  Please click enter.

1787
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,720
- Enter.
 -  Click enter.

1788
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,760
What is that?

1789
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,420
There are 10 seconds remaining. In 10,

1790
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,320
- nine,
 -  Hold on.

1791
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,860
eight, seven,

1792
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,430
- "Nancy Lang".
 -  six,

1793
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,820
five, four,

1794
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,620
Seok Jin, you're out.

1795
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,370
- Seok Jin is out.
 -  This is really...

1796
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:52,490
- Please stand on the spot.
 -  This is really unfair.

1797
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,600
This is really...

1798
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,260
So the second person to be out...

1799
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,020
is Jee Seok Jin!

1800
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,660
(The second round)

1801
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,520
(Seok Jin is out.)

1802
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,710
(Falling)

1803
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,430
(Seok Jin falls down.)

1804
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:10,960
(I won't forget you, "Linen".)

1805
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,290
(His efforts were in vain.)

1806
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,820
- There was no way out of "Nen".
 -  Seok Jin.

1807
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,560
I did so well.

1808
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,520
- Three chances were used.
 -  Change of direction and skip turn.

1809
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,590
- Then it was the "Nen" from linen.
 -  That line is really difficult.

1810
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,220
- There's no word for that.
 -  "Nen" was difficult.

1811
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,740
This is really annoying.

1812
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,160
This is really difficult.

1813
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,260
You should remember this.

1814
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,020
The words that the computer comes up with...

1815
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,660
- is totally unexpected.
 -  It's completely different.

1816
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,760
- The machine is skilled.
 -  It's at an advanced difficulty.

1817
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,320
It's the end for us if that robot gets angry.

1818
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,820
- Next is the fourth match.
 -  It's going to be fast.

1819
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,120
We will begin.

1820
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,790
I'll do my best.

1821
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,620
(Ji Hyo was eliminated in the third round and the fourth round begins.)

1822
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,520
The order is very important.

1823
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,500
Tae Hyun, please enter the first word.

1824
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,780
- "Camera".
 -  Now you remember, right?

1825
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,320
- Right after I was dropped.
 -  He wrote "Camera".

1826
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,190
- That's difficult.
 -  J-bot enters "Scrofula".

1827
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,180
The word must begin with "Yeok".

1828
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,790
Please remember that you can apply initial sound law.

1829
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,420
You can begin with "Yeok".

1830
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,960
This is difficult.

1831
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,160
There are many words to choose.

1832
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,520
Hyeri wrote down her word.

1833
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,090
- "Yeok".
 -  "Gwol"?

1834
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,160
"Mountain strength".

1835
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,430
J-bot countered "Mountain strength" with "Sanggwol".

1836
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,620
- What about "Gwoljang"?
 -  It's "Gwol".

1837
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:22,560
(He escaped from crisis.)

1838
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,620
It's "Gwol".

1839
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,190
- Oh, my.
 -  "Rally".

1840
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:30,460
- Even Haha is doing well.
 -  Contrary to our expectations,

1841
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,160
Haha keeps surviving.

1842
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:35,690
J-bot entered "Corporate rights". It's now "Gwon".

1843
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,890
"Mr Gwon".

1844
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,590
- I know a "Mr Gwon".
 -  He wrote "Power".

1845
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,160
- In response to "Power",
 -  Wow.

1846
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,490
("Seychelles")

1847
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,610
- J-bot...
 -  Min Ho.

1848
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:49,290
- Min Ho!
 -  entered "Seychelles".

1849
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,020
Now it's Min Ho's turn. He is in a tough spot.

1850
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,820
"Shall we dance"?

1851
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:57,520
I think it'll work.

1852
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,790
- That's a sentence.
 -  It's incorrect.

1853
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,490
- Use a chance.
 -  "Chelles".

1854
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,920
- Chance.
 -  Chance.

1855
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,260
Everything depends on this.

1856
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,220
Min Ho will use his chance.

1857
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,990
I'll use the attacking chance.

1858
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,320
He chooses to attack someone else.

1859
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,290
- Min Ho.
 -  Who will it be?

1860
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:15,390
Please shout out their name.

1861
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,620
(The person designated by Min Ho has a risk of being eliminated.)

1862
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,320
(Will it be Jae Seok?)

1863
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,230
(Will it be Gary?)

1864
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,670
Tae Hyun.

1865
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,540
- "Chelles" is passed on...
 -  Oh, my.

1866
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,620
- to Tae Hyun.
 -  Thank you.

1867
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,960
- To Tae Hyun.
 -  Thank you, Min Ho.

1868
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,320
"Seychelles"? I've never heard of it.

1869
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,960
- It's an island.
 -  Isn't it a nation of archipelagos?

1870
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,090
- That isn't a word we usually use.
 -  "Chelles".

1871
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,490
- Really.
 -  Yes, it is the name of a country.

1872
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,560
The Republic of Seychelles.

1873
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:45,690
I'd like to use an announcer chance.

1874
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,950
Tae Hyun chose to use the announcer chance.

1875
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,390
- You don't know, either. Do you?
 -  "Chelles".

1876
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,120
- He's typing something.
 -  Is he allowed to do that?

1877
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,840
- This is better than a dictionary.
 -  It is.

1878
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,020
It's better than a dictionary.

1879
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,260
I want that one.

1880
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,290
(He's blaming his elimination on the dictionary.)

1881
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,790
There must be no words that begins with "Chelles".

1882
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,390
He's shaking his head.

1883
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,640
- "Self-service car wash".
 -  It really is an AI.

1884
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,290
- Ten, nine, eight,
 -  Eight,

1885
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,860
- seven, six,
 -  seven, six,

1886
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,420
- five, four, three,
 -  He gave up.

1887
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,560
- two, one.
 -  two, one.

1888
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,850
- Time is up.
 -  It's over.

1889
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,020
- You're out.
 -  I'm sorry.

1890
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,360
Tae Hyun is out.

1891
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:28,230
- "Chelles" is hard for me, too.
 -  You can still write it.

1892
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,560
You can try.

1893
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,990
- It worked!
 -  Can we try again?

1894
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,890
(What just happened?)

1895
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,860
- "Shelley".
 -  It worked.

1896
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,660
- "Chelles" is hard for me, too.
 -  You can still write it.

1897
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,690
You can try.

1898
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,790
(Tae Hyun manages to survive.)

1899
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,590
- It worked!
 -  "Shelley".

1900
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,260
- It worked.
 -  "Shelley" worked.

1901
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,420
(Tae Hyun succeeded with "Shelley".)

1902
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:51,060
(It is a plot-twist that occurred in a matter of seconds.)

1903
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,460
(Luck is another ability bestowed upon only humans.)

1904
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,890
- It worked.
 -  "Shelley" passes.

1905
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:56,260
- I can't believe this.
 -  Now,

1906
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,140
- "Shelley" passes.
 -  What is "Shelley"?

1907
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,260
What is "Shelley"?

1908
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,360
"Shelley" is the name of a British poet.

1909
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,620
- "Shelley" is a British poet.
 -  Is she a poet?

1910
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,340
She's one of the greatest Romantic poets.

1911
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,460
- What's the next letter?
 -  "Shelley" is a word.

1912
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:10,960
It's "Hoong".

1913
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,620
Since Tae Hyun needs to go two times,

1914
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,260
- That's too difficult.
 -  it's his turn again.

1915
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,590
- It's "Hoong".
 -  You must have angered it.

1916
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,020
That's a useless chance!

1917
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,260
(Tae Hyun uses the announcer chance again.)

1918
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,790
Just use the time.

1919
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,490
He used the same chance.

1920
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,920
(Will he be able to save Tae Hyun?)

1921
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,890
- There's a word.
 -  "Public relations".

1922
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,520
"Hoonggeo".

1923
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,910
- Pardon?
 -  "Hoonggeo".

1924
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,520
- What is that?
 -  Please type in "Hoonggeo".

1925
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,730
(Tae Hyun survives.)

1926
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,590
- "Hoonggeo" works.
 -  What does it mean?

1927
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,880
"Hoonggeo" means...

1928
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,160
the death of a king.

1929
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,690
Next up is Hyeri.

1930
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,260
"Seong Deok Seon".

1931
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,440
Use the time to think.

1932
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,260
- "Seong Dong Il".
 -  "Holy water".

1933
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,160
- Okay.
 -  What?

1934
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,730
- It's "Royal secret inspector".
 -  "Royal secret inspector".

1935
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,890
A word that begins with "Ddo".

1936
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,800
(It's another name for royal secret inspector.)

1937
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,230
- "Tortilla"?
 -  "Tortilla"?

1938
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,550
"Ddoddo burger".

1939
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,060
- Wait.
 -  Is there such a thing?

1940
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,790
- "Ddoddo burger"?
 -  It ends if you press enter.

1941
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:12,600
- Press enter if you're confident.
 -  Shouldn't you press enter?

1942
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,460
I'll begin the countdown. Ten,

1943
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:17,060
nine, eight,

1944
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,520
- He has many chances.
 -  seven, six, five,

1945
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,420
- Attacking chance.
 -  He will use the attacking chance.

1946
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,620
- To whom will you use the chance?
 -  Attacking chance.

1947
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:30,440
(Everyone is nervous.)

1948
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,500
(Who will Haha choose?)

1949
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,390
Please shout...

1950
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,690
(He points numerous times.)

1951
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,620
Please shout out their name. Who is it?

1952
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,560
Tae Hyun.

1953
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,520
I heard him! It's Tae Hyun.

1954
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,420
People are getting eliminated in order.

1955
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,520
(Why is it me again?)

1956
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,360
- Tae Hyun is out of chances.
 -  A word that begins with "Ddo".

1957
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,590
- You're out without chances.
 -  What word can there be?

1958
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,660
- Haha used his designation chance.
 -  You're out without it.

1959
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,230
It's now Tae Hyun's turn.

1960
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,960
- Skipping is...
 -  That is wrong.

1961
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,020
(Please show us another miracle.)

1962
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,420
- Skipping is...
 -  That is wrong.

1963
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,820
- You were incorrect once.
 -  Try "Insane".

1964
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:11,920
(He did it.)

1965
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:16,060
- "Peer".
 -  There's that word.

1966
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,120
- "Peer".
 -  There's that word.

1967
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,190
(Tae Hyun knows how to change the game.)

1968
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,090
- Tae Hyun...
 -  He's like a weed.

1969
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:30,420
- You're amazing.
 -  is very skilled.

1970
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,120
You're today's winner.

1971
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,730
It pops out immediately.

1972
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,520
I don't think we can win against that.

1973
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,800
(J-bot continues with difficult words.)

1974
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,990
(Jae Seok is out.)

1975
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,230
Oh, my.

1976
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:48,050
- Isn't "Stony slopes" too much?
 -  It is.

1977
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,140
(It means a slope with a lot of stones.)

1978
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:51,690
(Haha is out.)

1979
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,060
Type in anything.

1980
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,490
(Gary is out.)

1981
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,420
Oh my goodness.

1982
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,190
(Tae Hyun perseveres like a weed.)

1983
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:03,490
Tae Hyun, come over here.

1984
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,120
Oh my gosh!

1985
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,320
(Tae Hyun is out.)

1986
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:10,220
- J-bot has its critical blows.
 -  Really.

1987
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,580
He is out.

1988
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,950
It has difficult words up its sleeves.

1989
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:18,210
Now, we are left with Hyeri and Min Ho.

1990
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,120
It's a match between the top two.

1991
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,060
- Hyeri, write anything.
 -  Go, Min Ho!

1992
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,390
(It's a match between Hyeri, Min Ho and J-bot.)

1993
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:24,460
It's the final match!

1994
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,590
The final battle against AI draws near.

1995
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,320
It's the final round of...

1996
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,460
AI Kungkungtta.

1997
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,730
(The finals to decide Running Man representative)

1998
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,620
The final winner will be decided soon.

1999
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,090
(Only one person can compete against J-bot on behalf of humans.)

2000
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:42,730
All right. The final round begins now.

2001
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,730
(The eighth round of AI Kungkungtta begins.)

2002
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,390
Hyeri is the first.

2003
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,690
(Question)

2004
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,990
J-bot writes "Nicely".

2005
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,920
Please write the next word.

2006
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,960
It will be the other person's turn after writing a word.

2007
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,360
- "Law department". Incorrect.
 -  That's wrong.

2008
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,960
10, 9. "Parents of students".

2009
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,560
He wrote "Law" and J-bot wrote "Parents of students".

2010
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,120
All right. "Brothers". "Extinction".

2011
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,790
"Seats".

2012
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:18,990
J-bot wrote "Asbestos".

2013
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,390
Write "Haha's mum".

2014
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,320
You don't have any more chances!

2015
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,060
"Yoong"...

2016
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,490
It's "Yoong" from "Asbestos".

2017
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,890
- She's writing "Loan".
 -  That will work.

2018
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,060
She wrote "Loan".

2019
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:33,020
The next word is "Magnetism".

2020
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,090
Hyeri is really serious about this.

2021
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,860
"Stairs". Next is "Gloss".

2022
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,420
There are only two people on the stage, but a whole page is filled.

2023
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,490
Min Ho wrote "Law department" before. What will he write?

2024
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:45,710
(Laws)

2025
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:48,260
He wrote "Laws" this time.

2026
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,520
Next is "Sapling". What will be next?

2027
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,320
I will count to 10 as soon as his turn begins.

2028
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:55,780
(Incorrect.)

2029
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,340
Her first attempt was incorrect.

2030
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,890
10... "Adept". She wrote "Adept".

2031
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,860
Now it's "Reconstruction".

2032
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,320
This is really tricky.

2033
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,390
"Reconstruction"?

2034
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:08,020
He doesn't have much time to think.

2035
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,560
- You have 10 seconds.
 -  I don't know if there are any.

2036
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,730
We will start counting down. Ten, nine,

2037
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,020
eight, seven,

2038
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,160
six, five,

2039
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,460
- four, three,
 -  Write something!

2040
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,780
2... "Jeupsik"? That is not a word.

2041
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,320
We'll start counting down. Ten, nine,

2042
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,230
eight, seven,

2043
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:28,920
- six, five,
 -  There is a word.

2044
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,690
- four...
 -  "Juice squeezer" sounds right.

2045
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,620
Again, we'll count down. 10, 9...

2046
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,660
(Will he win this time?)

2047
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,460
- Four, three, two, one.
 -  "Juice squeezer" sounds right.

2048
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,960
"Jeupjuh" is not a word.

2049
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,230
Min Ho. Out.

2050
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,990
"Juice squeezer" would've worked.

2051
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:48,120
- What did you say?
 -  There was "Juice squeezer".

2052
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,520
Min Ho. Out.

2053
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,560
(Min Ho is out.)

2054
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,620
Hyeri.

2055
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,590
(Mixed emotions)

2056
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,820
There was "Juice squeezer".

2057
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,060
Min Ho is out.

2058
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,190
Hyeri wins.

2059
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,860
Congratulations.

2060
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,890
(She is the winner of AI Kungkungtta.)

2061
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:07,460
- Hyeri, I'm so proud of you.
 -  I can't believe she won.

2062
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:10,890
But everything so far was to choose one person...

2063
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:14,560
who will compete against J-bot,

2064
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,690
one-on-one.

2065
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:20,290
Who will be the ultimate winner?

2066
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:23,360
Hyeri, the last one standing,

2067
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,760
will compete against J-bot.

2068
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,520
(J-bot is 4 years old.)

2069
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,460
Let's find out...

2070
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,390
who the ultimate winner will be.

2071
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,360
The match starts now.

2072
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
(The final battle begins.)

2073
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,060
- All right.
 -  You can do it.

2074
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,020
(Does J-bot have a weakness?)

2075
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,230
The next word is...

2076
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:51,120
(During the practice game...)

2077
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,390
"Cheater".

2078
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:55,360
(Seok Jin won J-bot with the word "Cheater".)

2079
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,620
- What is that?
 -  Congratulations, you made it.

2080
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,790
- What is wrong with it?
 -  Did it resign?

2081
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,700
- Have I won?
 -  Yes.

2082
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,960
Did he defeat the machine?

2083
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,420
Oh my gosh. I didn't realise.

2084
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,790
Is there no word connecting "Cheater"?

2085
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,560
(She used to act in a world without machines.)

2086
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,960
(Now, she challenges J-bot by herself.)

2087
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,460
"Master" is the first word.

2088
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:22,020
All right. Would Hyeri be able to achieve victory...

2089
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:25,890
in the battle against J-bot?

2090
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,660
"President" was the first word, and "Funeral" is the second.

2091
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,790
(They do not want...)

2092
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,820
(Hyeri to be defeated.)

2093
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,560
"President" was the first word, and "Funeral" is the second.

2094
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,520
She wrote "Doctor", and J-bot wrote "Huntsman".

2095
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,590
(Huntsman?)

2096
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,420
- Really?
 -  Oh my.

2097
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,160
(Oh, my.)

2098
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,320
All right. J-bot writes "Huntsman".

2099
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,860
- That happened last time.
 -  Hyeri's next.

2100
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,560
Is someone eavesdropping?

2101
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,920
Now, Hyeri must continue.

2102
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,690
- Hyeri, try "Kkundon".
 -  Maybe that'll work.

2103
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,120
This is a difficult word.

2104
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,020
"Kkundon" turned out to be incorrect.

2105
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,790
- Isn't there a word?
 -  This is too close.

2106
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:07,890
- This is too bad.
 -  J-bot is mean.

2107
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,020
All right. Ten, nine,

2108
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,620
- eight, seven,
 -  Try any word.

2109
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,290
- six, five,
 -  Write some random word.

2110
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,920
- four, three,
 -  Try "Kkunsa".

2111
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,660
- two, one.
 -  Is that a word?

2112
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,990
Stop. Hyeri. Out.

2113
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,790
(AI J-bot is victorious.)

2114
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,660
- That was so close.
 -  All right.

2115
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,820
Are you ready?

2116
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,620
Hyeri. Out.

2117
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,920
(In the final round, Hyeri loses.)

2118
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,670
(Crying)

2119
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:45,620
That was the end of the AI Kungkungtta.

2120
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,160
So Seok Jin is pretty much the winner.

2121
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,820
J-bot is the winner of the final round.

2122
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,460
(J-bot is the final winner.)

2123
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,520
So this is the end.

2124
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,420
Although we lost in this battle...

2125
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,760
against J-bot,

2126
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,510
we do have a winner among us.

2127
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:04,960
Congratulations, Hyeri.

2128
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,660
(Hyeri is the winner of the day.)

2129
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,680
I will give the winner her prize.

2130
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,420
- Thank you!
 -  What is it?

2131
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,760
- I envy you.
 -  What is it?

2132
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,730
The prize is...

2133
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,860
a set of electromagnetic shielding equipment.

2134
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,490
- What?
 -  Is that it?

2135
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:21,560
It will protect you from electromagnetic radiation.

2136
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,160
- Hold on a second.
 -  Please defeat all the radiation.

2137
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,390
- What are these?
 -  Thank you.

2138
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:28,730
- It's a full set.
 -  Look at her facial expression!

2139
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,420
- There are even long Johns.
 -  Goodness.

2140
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,460
(She'll be fully protected.)

2141
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,990
- What are those?
 -  They're long Johns.

2142
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,360
Hyeri is the winner!

2143
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,420
(Congratulations, Hyeri. Thank you, Min Ho and Tae Hyun.)

2144
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,820
(Next week...)

2145
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,120
(at 6:10pm,)

2146
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,370
(there will be a Running Man Spring Special.)

2147
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,020
I'd like to dine with you.

2148
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,270
It's Seo Joon.

2149
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,760
(I'm Sorry,)

2150
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,020
It's Actress Lee Yo Won.

2151
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,260
(I Love You.)

2152
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:02,250
- Really?
 -  He's Kyuhyun.

2153
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:10,340
(Next week at 6:10pm, I'm Sorry, I Love You.)
