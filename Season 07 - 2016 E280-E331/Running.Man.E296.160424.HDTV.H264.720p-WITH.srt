1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,830
- He's here.
 -  It's Seung Joon.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,430
He's my high school buddy, Lee Seung Joon.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,530
Jae Seok had a girl that he dated for a long time.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,240
She was tall and ugly.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,730
- He's out of his mind.
 -  He's Jae Seok's critic.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,880
- Mother!
 -  She's Jong Kook's mother.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,070
- He's like a daughter.
 -  Daughter?

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,530
He's the youngest son who is like a daughter.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,800
He's like a daughter, isn't he?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,350
(Witness Jong Kook acting cute.)

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,310
He's my role model.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,110
(A disastrous audition takes place in front of the legendary singer.)

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,210
He gave me the dream of becoming a celebrity.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,340
- Hello, Sir.
 -  Hello.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,930
Hurry up.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,780
(A fierce race to find the Seven Loves begins now.)

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,130
Say, "Kwang Soo",

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,110
and Kwang Soo, please turn around while calling her name.

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,570
Kwang Soo!

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,180
(Hye Jin is Kwang Soo's first love. We will go meet her now.)

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,720
Several days ago,

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,300
we asked you guys about the unforgettable people in your life.

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,760
- Yes.
 -  "I'm Sorry, I Love You" Special.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
The second season is called Seven Loves.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,630
(Seven Loves)

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,940
The person each of you chose is waiting for you somewhere.

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,970
You have to meet all seven of them within 12 hours,

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,420
complete a mission, take a picture and put it in the album...

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,630
in order to succeed.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,580
- Hurry up!
 -  Hello.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,170
(Each member chose one person.)

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,110
(Find the Seven Loves)

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,340
(The mission begins.)

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,530
Gosh, it's been such a long time since I was here.

35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,600
- Isn't your school around here?
 -  It's Yongmoon High School.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,800
Yongmoon High School is near Daehak-ro.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,300
It's in Anam-dong.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,400
Not much has changed around here.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,100
- Really? Is it the same?
 -  Yes.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,350
It's almost the same. It hasn't changed much.

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,310
How long has it been since you last saw this person?

42
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,190
I'm not sure how long it has been exactly,

43
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,130
but it's almost 20 years after graduating high school.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,230
- It must be so awkward.
 -  It will be awkward.

45
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,600
But he's a celebrity, too. Why didn't you meet him?

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,800
I know. He just suddenly started coming out on TV.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,940
You could contact him.

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,580
But at first, he appeared mostly on movies.

49
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,000
Just recently, I became convinced that it was really him.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,230
(Who is Jae Seok's Love?)

51
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,270
He's really popular these days.

52
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,130
- Is that right?
 -  Yes. I was really surprised.

53
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm really curious about who he is.

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,340
We used to have a lot of fun together.

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,830
(Jae Seok.)

56
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,890
- It's not that I didn't like him.
 -  You should come up with a story.

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,700
(Jae Seok, do you remember me?)

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,930
Hey!

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,420
(Hello, my friend.)

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,070
- Hey, Seung Joon!
 -  Hello.

61
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,130
(Who is Jae Seok's best friend?)

62
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,800
- Hey, Seung Joon!
 -  Hello.

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,510
You are Lee Seung Joon, right?

64
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,300
I am sorry. Are you okay?

65
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,450
You called me "brother" a while ago.

66
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,570
Did I?

67
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,810
Maybe I heard wrong.

68
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,500
If a pen stops working, you put saliva on it to make it work.

69
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,100
(The popular supporting actor, Lee Seung Joon, is here.)

70
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,520
I'll take this.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,240
I just almost killed myself.

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,910
Dr Song, are you all right?

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,530
(Is he really Jae Seok's best friend?)

74
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,530
You are Seung Joon, right?

75
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,880
- Hey!
 -  Welcome.

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,570
- Gosh...
 -  He's in "Descendants of the Sun".

77
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,600
- He's in "Descendants of the Sun"!
 -  Hello.

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
- You didn't know, right?
 -  Hello.

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,180
- Come here.
 -  He's my buddy!

80
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,800
- Is he really your friend?
 -  It's you, right?

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,330
But he's really awkward around you.

82
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,370
- Are you sure you're friends?
 -  It's you, right?

83
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,620
You are Lee Seung Joon, my high school buddy.

84
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,340
- Buddy.
 -  Hello, Jae Seok.

85
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,930
Did you hear his voice?

86
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,800
- It's so touching.
 -  It's really touching.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,900
See? Hey!

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,530
It's been such a long time. So it's really awkward.

89
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,430
- How long has it been?
 -  About 20 years.

90
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,170
- About 20 years.
 -  It's been 26 years.

91
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,900
We went to the same college, right?

92
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,070
I majored in theatre arts.

93
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,380
Right? And I majored in broadcasting and entertainment.

94
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,730
- It's you, right?
 -  Did you graduate?

95
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,780
No, I didn't.

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,970
- He's really like a friend.
 -  Then you are not alumni.

97
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,400
- That's what friends do to you.
 -  We were thinking that...

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,750
the fact that you were so close but lost touch with each other...

99
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,330
- means that one of you did wrong.
 -  Made a mistake.

100
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,000
- Did I upset you?
 -  Or...

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,370
Even if they are awkward now, when time passes, they will...

102
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,570
- Right.
 -  be like best friends again.

103
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,570
I don't know what it was. I don't remember, but...

104
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,180
are you still mad at me?

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
- It's been 26 years.
 -  Let him speak!

106
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,110
He won't look at Jae Seok.

107
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,740
Please look at me. You're not looking at me.

108
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,000
- We were really close.
 -  I feel so happy for them.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,900
I always went to his place. Right?

110
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,270
We were close. He came to my place often.

111
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,590
When I first saw you on TV,

112
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,430
I doubted that it was you. But it was really you.

113
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,770
What's this?

114
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,900
- You will know when you open it.
 -  Is it a report card?

115
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,830
They are report cards.

116
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,630
This is incredible. They brought all of these.

117
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,870
Seung Joon, this one is yours.

118
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,900
(He looks very smart. Was he a class president?)

119
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,730
- Oh, no.
 -  Wait.

120
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,300
- You weren't a good student.
 -  You had a C.

121
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,000
- I was really terrible at studying.
 -  His grades were inconsistent.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
- Let's check yours.
 -  Wait.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,430
- Gosh, my grades were...
 -  How were your grades?

124
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,200
- I was 15th in my class.
 -  You were okay.

125
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,590
- You were a good student.
 -  Then you were really smart.

126
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,900
- He's a genius!
 -  He was a genius.

127
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,780
- I'm not surprised.
 -  Who did better than him?

128
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,740
He should be a member of Mensa.

129
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,670
In the first semester of sophomore year, I ranked 15th.

130
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,000
- Starting the second semester...
 -  Your grades went down.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,930
I ranked 46th in my class.

132
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,090
- You ranked 46th?
 -  But you see,

133
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,470
I wasn't interested in studying, so I chose not to study.

134
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,630
But Jae Seok attended extra classes and studied hard.

135
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,000
He studied, but he still didn't do well.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
He must've been with his girlfriend all the time.

137
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,950
- You used to go to Yonsei Academy.
 -  How did you know that?

138
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,300
- Didn't you use to go there, too?
 -  This is hilarious.

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,370
I didn't go there.

140
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,630
- He's like Jae Seok's critic.
 -  He studied very hard.

141
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,800
- It's because...
 -  And still, you were terrible.

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,880
Wait a minute.

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,170
(Jae Seok is flustered.)

144
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,230
- That's right.
 -  He's funny, isn't he?

145
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,170
- I didn't have tutors either.
 -  He's a critic.

146
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,070
- You changed a lot.
 -  He's criticising Jae Seok.

147
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,200
He used to be very handsome.

148
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,110
- Seung Joon was...
 -  He was very charming.

149
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,830
Seung Joon was like Park Ji Sung back in the days.

150
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,230
- There's an album, too.
 -  I am here.

151
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,970
Why did you hang out with a person like him?

152
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,330
Jae Seok hasn't changed much.

153
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,500
- Yes, this is me.
 -  How was Jae Seok in the past?

154
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,970
- He was really funny.
 -  Was he funny?

155
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,990
- Is that right?
 -  He was funny ever since.

156
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,440
He wasn't popular among girls, right?

157
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,780
- But he had good sense of humour.
 -  Girls liked him at first...

158
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,760
- But did he obsess?
 -  because he was funny.

159
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,540
But that's all.

160
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,930
- No, but...
 -  I'm sure he didn't date back then.

161
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,670
- He dated girls.
 -  Did he?

162
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,180
Jae Seok had a girl that he dated for a long time.

163
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,220
- We want to hear things like this.
 -  We didn't know.

164
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,300
- We want to know everything.
 -  This is it.

165
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,370
- Hey!
 -  Stop it.

166
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,670
- Seung Joon.
 -  We want to hear more.

167
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,170
- I am so curious.
 -  No way.

168
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,300
- He's crazy.
 -  Who was it?

169
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,870
We met again after 26 years.

170
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,910
I even remember her name and her school.

171
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,830
- Let's look for her.
 -  Let's find her.

172
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't say it. I will talk about your girlfriends, too.

173
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,330
- Was she pretty?
 -  I will reveal your stories.

174
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,280
She was tall and ugly.

175
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,600
(Jae Seok's ideal type is a tall and ugly woman.)

176
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,700
- Hey.
 -  She was just tall.

177
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,070
- But it's true.
 -  He is...

178
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,770
- Hey.
 -  She wasn't pretty.

179
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,810
He's unbelievable. Goodness.

180
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,940
Hey! Sure, she wasn't beautiful.

181
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,460
- She wasn't the prettiest, but...
 -  His face turned red.

182
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,300
But she's still my ex-girlfriend.

183
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,970
- I'm sorry, but...
 -  He called her "ugly".

184
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,840
He dated her for a long time.

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,090
He used to bring her with him when our friends hung out.

186
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,630
- I see.
 -  I'm not surprised.

187
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,300
- How did he treat girls?
 -  What was his style?

188
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,230
- Did he dress well?
 -  I am really curious about that.

189
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,140
- Was he like Song Joong Ki?
 -  She controlled him completely.

190
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,740
I knew it. He hasn't changed.

191
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,830
- It's always how we expected.
 -  That's embarrassing.

192
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,670
That's why he sympathises with Kwang Soo.

193
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,930
- That's right. I feel like...
 -  That's why he helps him.

194
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,270
you are a lot like me. That's why I tell you to confess your love.

195
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,680
- But I am not like the old you.
 -  Hey!

196
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,070
I don't like tall and ugly women.

197
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,290
(Tall and ugly girls aren't my type.)

198
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,470
So he prefers...

199
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,740
- short women.
 -  That is true.

200
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,220
I think he briefly dated a pretty girl...

201
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,400
- Really?
 -  when he was in high school, no?

202
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,940
- You met a lot of girls.
 -  Gosh.

203
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,100
- You're a playboy.
 -  Goodness.

204
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,930
- I wasn't a playboy.
 -  But his relationship...

205
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,240
didn't last a month.

206
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,380
I had a really hard time.

207
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,930
- After you broke up?
 -  Yes.

208
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,370
Breaking up after one month is still painful.

209
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,870
Actually, although I dated her for a month,

210
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,180
I only met her once.

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,380
Are you sure you dated her?

212
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,630
That's not what we call a relationship.

213
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,870
You dated her alone.

214
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,130
Whenever I started seeing someone, I told all of my friends.

215
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,170
She just met you once and dumped you.

216
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,800
- We've all gone through dire times.
 -  But I still don't...

217
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,110
- understand why she dumped me.
 -  That's what he's been through.

218
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,270
- Seung Joon looks very handsome.
 -  You're right.

219
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,400
Now I remember something.

220
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,830
- Were you like this as well?
 -  Actually,

221
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,270
- Seung Joon...
 -  No, I wasn't.

222
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,060
was adored a lot...

223
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,230
- amongst our friends.
 -  Right.

224
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,740
We pinched your cheeks like this often.

225
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,190
We really did. Because he was cute.

226
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,370
What are you doing to him?

227
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,680
He is my friend!

228
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,210
(Seung Joon wipes his cheek.)

229
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,200
(Why are you doing this to me, Jae Seok?)

230
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,930
- You just hurt your friend.
 -  Gosh.

231
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,970
- He didn't even...
 -  Hey. He's my friend.

232
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,230
He didn't even appear on variety programmes before.

233
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,870
- It's his first time.
 -  Is it?

234
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,930
- It is.
 -  I see.

235
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,230
And you just pinched his cheek.

236
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,100
Because he was so cute. He was very cute at the time.

237
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,700
We met for the first time in 26 years, and you pinched my cheek.

238
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,270
(We met for the first time in 26 years.)

239
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,630
(Seung Joon is Jae Seok's critic.)

240
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,910
- Gosh.
 -  We met...

241
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,100
- Hey, you're my old friend.
 -  Here it is.

242
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,390
(It's my turn now.)

243
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,930
(You started this first.)

244
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,340
- Goodness.
 -  How do you like that?

245
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,070
- Good job.
 -  It feels so good.

246
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,520
(Seung Joon is like Jae Seok's enemy.)

247
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
(My friend, you are a talented entertainer.)

248
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,230
- I like it!
 -  It's because they're friends.

249
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,000
- What a friendship.
 -  Only friends can do such things.

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,930
I almost broke into tears.

251
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,170
- Why?
 -  He always...

252
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,970
- Are you touched?
 -  used to look at me like that...

253
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,530
when he was astounded. And I just saw that look.

254
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,070
- "How do you like that?"
 -  "How do you like that?"

255
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,870
(Jae Seok is reminded of his old memories.)

256
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,970
Then why did you fight?

257
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,200
- This is so nice.
 -  Goodness.

258
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
- Why did you fight, then?
 -  You were so close.

259
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,930
Tell us why you fought.

260
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,580
It was on a weekend. We were at my place.

261
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,470
- I went to his house every weekend.
 -  Please be quiet.

262
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,910
- I really...
 -  I'm talking.

263
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,010
(He's lost for words.)

264
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,110
We went to my house after school.

265
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,470
(They were always together after school.)

266
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,870
- We were upset with each other.
 -  Why?

267
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,700
- You don't remember why.
 -  I don't remember the reason.

268
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,230
- So Jae Seok went home.
 -  I see.

269
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,140
And a friend called me after two hours.

270
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,500
- He was one of our friends.
 -  Okay.

271
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,270
(He received a phone call from one of their friends.)

272
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,980
He said, "Seung Joon, why are you home?"

273
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,350
So I said, "Why? What are you guys doing?"

274
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,380
He said, "We're all in Jongno. Why aren't you here?"

275
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,610
I told him that I didn't know about it.

276
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,580
And he said, "What are you talking about? Didn't Jae Seok tell you?

277
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,300
- So Jae Seok didn't tell you.
 -  Really?

278
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,900
- Because he was upset.
 -  He was mad at you.

279
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,430
- Jae Seok was upset.
 -  So I got really mad.

280
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,800
(He was betrayed by Jae Seok.)

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,130
So I ran to Jongno.

282
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,730
- Did you run there?
 -  I did.

283
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,300
- So he went to Jongno.
 -  Gosh.

284
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,070
So he went to Jongno to see Jae Seok.

285
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,410
So I went there.

286
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,980
I was at a crosswalk, waiting for the green light.

287
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,670
- Will this be okay to talk about?
 -  It's okay.

288
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,940
And I saw my friends across the street.

289
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,570
Immediately after the light changed colour, I ran toward them..

290
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,320
and gave a flying kick to Jae Seok.

291
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,340
Really?

292
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,080
- Really?
 -  Did you hit me?

293
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,230
Goodness.

294
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,160
- You hit me.
 -  It's too late, Jae Seok.

295
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,340
- It's been 26 years since then.
 -  Gosh.

296
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,340
This is school violence!

297
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,040
This is school violence.

298
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,970
I'll kick you this time.

299
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,200
(It's my turn.)

300
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,020
The others were also very close friends.

301
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,440
- They tried to stop us.
 -  Right, they did.

302
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,880
So, to be honest,

303
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,070
I've been feeling sorry to Jae Seok for 26 years.

304
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,110
You must've been.

305
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,630
What do you mean?

306
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,790
Then apologise to me.

307
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,810
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,490
I keep picturing Jae Seok getting kicked by Seung Joon.

309
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,570
I'm sure he reacted like this.

310
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,100
(Young Jae Seok would've reacted like a coward.)

311
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,210
And then he'd get hit.

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,730
So Seung Joon beat Jae Seok.

313
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,030
I'm sure I didn't stay quiet if he hit me.

314
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,110
(I probably didn't stay still.)

315
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,070
I must've hit him back.

316
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,700
- I hit him.
 -  I'm sure you ran away.

317
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,830
- What did you do after you got hit?
 -  Did he hit you...

318
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,130
or did he just stay quiet?

319
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,940
I don't remember getting hit by him.

320
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,980
Gosh.

321
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,540
That is ridiculous.

322
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,440
Don't you think you've gone too far?

323
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,270
Gosh, Seung Joon!

324
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,600
So Jae Seok ran away.

325
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,330
- That's just how I remember.
 -  That is so funny.

326
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,000
- Gosh, this is ridiculous.
 -  I think...

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,030
- he just stayed still.
 -  So he didn't hit Seung Joon.

328
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,440
- Gosh, Seung Joon.
 -  You were scared.

329
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,130
There was a friend of ours named Byung Soo.

330
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,610
I think I told you this before.

331
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,280
We screwed up our exams and...

332
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,610
went to Han River near the 63 Building.

333
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,300
And we decided to have some ice cream.

334
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,800
So Byung Soo went to buy ice cream.

335
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,380
And some older guys came to us...

336
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,110
and put their arms around us like this.

337
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,930
I know what kind of guys they are.

338
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,270
- Me, too.
 -  Like friends?

339
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,570
- Yes, like close friends.
 -  Okay.

340
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,800
- They told you to smile, right?
 -  Like friends.

341
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
- I know.
 -  They acted like friends.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,930
I was excited to go to Yeouido that day,

343
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,240
so I wore expensive socks and shoes.

344
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,990
They told me to take my socks off.

345
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,350
- Your socks?
 -  Yes. Then one of them...

346
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,380
said, "Wait."

347
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,900
"Those socks are mine."

348
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,830
(Wait, they are mine.)

349
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,330
- Why would they take your socks?
 -  I know.

350
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,670
- They're my socks.
 -  You had no say.

351
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,240
They were talking about what to do with my socks.

352
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,740
So what came to my mind was Byung Soo.

353
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,780
He wasn't with us.

354
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,580
So I thought he could call the police when he saw us.

355
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,240
So I looked back.

356
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,400
And I saw him walking toward us with ice cream.

357
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,870
(He was walking toward us with the ice cream.)

358
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,110
He started to walk away.

359
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,730
- Good.
 -  So I thought it'd be over.

360
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,130
I thought he went to call the police.

361
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,430
- So I was relieved.
 -  "He's calling the police."

362
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,650
So I waited for the police, thinking "You guys are dead!"

363
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,180
But few minutes later,

364
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,630
he came back with more ice cream.

365
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,720
(He returned with more ice cream.)

366
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,330
(He bought more ice cream for the new friends.)

367
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,000
This is so hilarious.

368
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,420
- So...
 -  Is this true?

369
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,500
- This is funny.
 -  He thought...

370
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,900
- more friends came.
 -  Gosh.

371
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,620
- So he bought more.
 -  This is so funny.

372
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,140
This is so hilarious.

373
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
- Did this really happen?
 -  Did it?

374
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,130
- Yes.
 -  It's a true story.

375
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,330
Gosh, that's unbelievable.

376
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,730
We were all bewildered.

377
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,770
(Jae Seok's high school friends are entertaining.)

378
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,980
- He bought more ice cream.
 -  That was so funny.

379
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,530
So Byung Soo was of no help.

380
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,730
He was.

381
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,310
There was a friend named Dae Seong who lived near the school.

382
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
We went to his house and made a lot of prank calls.

383
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,030
Can I tell them what we did?

384
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,430
Yes, please.

385
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,770
- Please tell us.
 -  Don't do it.

386
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,770
- Please.
 -  Don't say it.

387
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,200
- Come on.
 -  We have to meet other people, too!

388
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,240
- It is okay.
 -  We have enough time.

389
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,680
- Please tell us.
 -  Let's listen to him first.

390
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,600
- We made a prank call at 2am.
 -  2am?

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,810
We said, "Hello, this is the SBS broadcasting station."

392
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,370
And we chose one of the SBS radio programmes.

393
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,530
- It was "The Starry Night".
 -  And he said,

394
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,510
"This is Yoo Jae Seok, the programme's DJ."

395
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,920
And those who received our calls were half-asleep,

396
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,960
so they all believed what we were saying.

397
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,390
So we would ask where they lived and they would tell us.

398
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,170
They even sang songs if we asked them to.

399
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,200
That is harsh. Goodness.

400
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,830
I remember that.

401
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,200
- Gosh, you're unbelievable.
 -  I did that, too.

402
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,430
So we'd all burst into laughter watching him do that.

403
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,600
He was a prankster.

404
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,920
I am so sorry. I was so young and immature.

405
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,100
My friends liked it so much and kept asking me to do it again.

406
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,770
- So you wanted to make them laugh.
 -  Right.

407
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,570
No one ever revealed Jae Seok's school days like this before.

408
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,000
- You're right. No one has.
 -  Right.

409
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,070
That was so authentic.

410
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,080
It's because my real friend is here.

411
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,180
But really, since then,

412
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,980
I'd see him from a distance on the college campus.

413
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,820
When we ran into each other, we felt awkward.

414
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,510
- That's right.
 -  Because it's been a long time.

415
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,270
- After the incident.
 -  So we'd just say hello.

416
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,370
- Just like that.
 -  And...

417
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,670
our majors were different.

418
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,130
At that time, his classmates and mine...

419
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,830
- were in rivalry.
 -  I see.

420
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,300
We didn't think of them as our rival.

421
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,990
It's like the movie, "Friend".

422
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,700
Hold on. What did you just say?

423
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,610
We didn't think of you guys as our rival at all.

424
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,300
Jae Seok, calm down.

425
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,430
(You're making me angry.)

426
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,610
Stop, Jae Seok!

427
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,330
- No, no.
 -  Hey.

428
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,930
Gosh, get up.

429
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,340
- This is...
 -  Please get up.

430
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,580
- My goodness.
 -  Calm down.

431
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,340
What are you laughing at?

432
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,410
Gosh, then...

433
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,000
(Seung Joon knows how to fool with Jae Seok.)

434
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,290
- This is like "Friend".
 -  Gosh, Seung Joon.

435
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,840
Now, we're...

436
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,160
- going to have a Reminiscent Quiz.
 -  I see.

437
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,340
Here is the first question.

438
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,010
- You guys went to Jongno often.
 -  We did.

439
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,310
What was the name of the music cafe you used to go?

440
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
You must have told them about this.

441
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,910
The answer is "The 11th Street".

442
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,240
I think he's wrong.

443
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,430
Actually, I don't remember exactly.

444
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,840
Isn't that an online shopping mall?

445
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,390
(That's the name of an online store.)

446
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,830
(This isn't an advertisement.)

447
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,380
You can just say you don't remember.

448
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,300
At the time, in the music cafe located in Jongno 2-ga,

449
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,670
although we can easily watch music videos through the internet and VOD,

450
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,100
- at that time, we had to go...
 -  Right. They showed the videos.

451
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,070
there to watch the music videos of famous foreign singers.

452
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,470
- They had projectors for that.
 -  What is the answer, then?

453
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,730
- The answer is "The 18th Street".
 -  Right.

454
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,100
"The 18th Street".

455
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
- I said "The 11th Street".
 -  It wasn't "The 11th Street".

456
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
But I got "Street" correct.

457
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,670
- You're still wrong.
 -  Seung Joon and I...

458
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,930
- went there every weekend...
 -  They went often.

459
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,000
- with our friends.
 -  I think you guys were...

460
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,950
- Right.
 -  very innocent at that time.

461
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,410
- I'll give you the next question.
 -  It was "The 18th Street".

462
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,910
This is your photo.

463
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
- When was it taken?
 -  I have this, too.

464
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,450
This is Seung Joon. And this is Hyeong Man, our close friend.

465
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,710
This was a good friend of ours.

466
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,380
We took this photo...

467
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,910
when we went on a Boy Scout trip.

468
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,130
You're correct.

469
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,700
(He's correct.)

470
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,470
- Gosh.
 -  You look so...

471
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,570
- cute here.
 -  Right.

472
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,570
He was very cute. So we called him a cutie.

473
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,570
- He looks so cute.
 -  He is handsome.

474
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,000
- There are more photos.
 -  He was chubby.

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
- Really?
 -  I don't remember where this was.

476
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,900
We went to travel by ourselves.

477
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,480
This was Soyangho in Chuncheon.

478
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,930
Look at Jae Seok.

479
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,010
- Jae Seok looks...
 -  You look like a prankster.

480
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,600
He looks like a mischievous boy.

481
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,770
- Jae Seok looks better now.
 -  I had my hair cut short.

482
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,680
- We took it in early morning.
 -  It's been about 18 years.

483
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,500
I remember what we did that night.

484
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,330
(The photo brought back memories of a night in Chuncheon.)

485
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,880
One of us brought a flickering lamp that was used in clubs.

486
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,160
We danced for two hours at night under that lamp.

487
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,730
Is that why you want...

488
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,600
- to dance with us so much?
 -  Yes.

489
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
(Jae Seok always asks new guests to dance.)

490
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,050
- That's why he is good at dancing.
 -  Right.

491
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,450
Finally,

492
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,930
what character does Lee Seung Joon play in "Descendants of the Sun"?

493
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,830
(What is his character's name in "Descendants of the Sun"?)

494
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,240
This is hard.

495
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,450
Did they call you by your full name in the drama?

496
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,010
That's enough.

497
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,510
(Did he lie about watching the drama?)

498
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,270
I'll take this.

499
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,000
Apparently, that pen is not just any pen. It's poisonous.

500
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,140
(He acted as Dr Song Sang Hyun.)

501
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,000
- He was called Dr something, right?
 -  Then,

502
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,330
- Just the surname.
 -  just his surname will do.

503
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,130
- Really? I know his surname.
 -  Sure.

504
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,130
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Dr Song.

505
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,490
Mission cleared.

506
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,570
(He's correct.)

507
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,440
- Good job.
 -  We have a gift for you.

508
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,700
We've prepared a gold necklace.

509
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,670
You can put a photo in the necklace.

510
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,540
- It's real gold.
 -  It's real.

511
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,710
- That's so nice.
 -  Thank you.

512
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,970
You should give each other a hug.

513
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,530
Give each other a hug.

514
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,800
(I missed you, my friend.)

515
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,830
I hate that I have to leave.

516
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,300
(It's been 26 years, but it's as if they saw each other yesterday.)

517
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,980
(That's why they call each other friends.)

518
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,640
- I didn't know I'd see Seung Joon.
 -  Seriously.

519
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,470
- I found my friend again.
 -  You must have been so close.

520
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,730
- We were.
 -  You were best friends.

521
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,400
You saw him in the picture. I used to pinch his cheeks a lot.

522
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,630
We already spent two hours speaking to Seung Joon.

523
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,070
- We couldn't cut it short, though.
 -  I know.

524
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,040
- It was so much fun.
 -  It was so good.

525
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,220
I asked him if you were one of the top five guys in blind dates.

526
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,630
He said you were bluffing. Why would you lie about it?

527
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,600
- Why would you lie about it?
 -  Just be quiet.

528
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,370
- Why should I?
 -  Just be quiet.

529
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,930
I only remembered after we finished shooting his part.

530
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,200
- I'm saying this now,
 -  He said you were wrong.

531
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,170
but Seung Joon was no match for me.

532
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,040
- Hey.
 -  Both of you came in last, right?

533
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,100
I told you. I was one of the top five guys.

534
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,200
- Should I give him a call?
 -  You were probably the last.

535
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,340
How could he say my ex-girlfriend was tall and ugly?

536
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,500
- Oh, gosh.
 -  Who are we going to meet now?

537
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,380
- It's Seok Jin's guest.
 -  It's mine.

538
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,430
- When I was in middle school,
 -  The school nurse?

539
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,700
I had a huge crush on the school nurse.

540
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,270
- You spoke about her before.
 -  I used to show up on purpose.

541
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,760
I faked my illness.

542
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,510
She used to put her hand on my forehead. I loved it when she did.

543
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,370
If she was a school nurse back then, she's probably much older now.

544
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,370
I think she had just graduated from a university back then.

545
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,780
I think her name was Yeom Young Hee.

546
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,970
It's pretty here. This school looks so nice.

547
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,010
Look at them. Look at the students.

548
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,640
They look so young.

549
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,010
- It looks really nice.
 -  Doesn't it?

550
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,680
- This is called freedom.
 -  It's so nice here.

551
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,980
This is what a school campus is all about.

552
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,410
(He doesn't have much time to find the Second Love.)

553
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,690
Hello.

554
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,850
Building 102 is here.

555
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,500
Excuse me.

556
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,740
Hello.

557
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,570
Hello.

558
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,730
(Will Seok Jin's guest be amongst the crowd?)

559
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,280
I'm getting a little bit nervous.

560
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,880
I don't remember her face.

561
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,300
In middle school,

562
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,470
- The school nurse?
 -  I had a huge crush...

563
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,710
- on the school nurse.
 -  Is that so?

564
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,290
I used to show up on purpose. I faked my illness.

565
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,160
She used to put her hand on my forehead. I loved it when she did.

566
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,310
(Are you Seok Jin's first love?)

567
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,080
Hello.

568
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,340
Is it you?

569
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,590
Is it you?

570
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,780
(It's been a long time, Seok Jin.)

571
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,040
Is it really her?

572
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,320
Is that really her?

573
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,020
- You're a professor now.
 -  Yes, I am.

574
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,500
- Miss. I...
 -  Were you the school nurse?

575
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,630
- Yes.
 -  I had a huge crush on you.

576
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,090
I know.

577
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,630
(He finally confesses after a long time has passed.)

578
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,470
- Jee Seok Jin!
 -  Jee Seok Jin!

579
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,630
- Jee Seok Jin!
 -  I finally found you.

580
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,950
At that time, you were...

581
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,270
- Seok Jin's school nurse, right?
 -  Yes.

582
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,430
I had a big crush on her.

583
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,570
- It was a one-sided love.
 -  I used to...

584
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,540
fake illnesses and show up.

585
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,900
When she put her hand on my forehead, it healed everything.

586
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,210
(She even healed illnesses that he didn't have.)

587
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
I'm serious.

588
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,500
(Seok Jin, how's it now?)

589
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,680
- It was just like this.
 -  Anyway,

590
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
- Like this.
 -  Anyway,

591
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,070
(I'm healed already.)

592
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,500
- Excuse me, Ms Yeom.
 -  That's it.

593
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,030
Professor, I have a question to ask.

594
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,300
- He said you wouldn't remember him.
 -  Right.

595
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
- Because...
 -  She wasn't my homeroom teacher.

596
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,170
you were a school nurse and not his homeroom teacher.

597
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,570
You saw him once in a while. But do you remember him?

598
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,240
Do you still remember him?

599
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,810
(What is her response to the long-awaited question?)

600
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
Be honest.

601
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,130
(He's hurt.)

602
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,770
- She probably doesn't know him.
 -  This is how it's supposed to be.

603
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,200
- This is obvious.
 -  I'm not 100 percent sure.

604
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,030
- I don't remember him clearly.
 -  It'd be weird for her to remember.

605
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,800
When you were a school nurse, were there boys...

606
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,600
who used to fake illnesses to see you?

607
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,940
There were many.

608
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,770
- How could she say it herself?
 -  She's very innocent.

609
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,530
Even if you look at her now,

610
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,700
she's very beautiful.

611
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,030
- We are here...
 -  I was only 14 back then.

612
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,300
because Seok Jin said she was his favourite teacher.

613
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,880
But in reality, they are pretty much strangers.

614
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,370
- This is meaningless.
 -  She has no recollection of him.

615
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,900
- She doesn't know him.
 -  Miss Yeom,

616
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,100
it's fine as long as you are in my memory.

617
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,300
But I know our Seok Jin's song called, "I Know".

618
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,600
- Of course you do!
 -  Though it's not very popular.

619
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,640
Miss Yeom, it was very awkward when you said "Our Seok Jin".

620
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,870
(They've just met but she calls him "Our Seok Jin".)

621
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,700
That sounded really awkward.

622
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,980
Somebody is holding up his name.

623
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,930
- Thank you.
 -  But you know,

624
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,300
we have to ask her to do something to complete our mission.

625
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,930
- What does she have to do?
 -  There's a mission.

626
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,900
Seok Jin, your mission is...

627
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,980
Don't call him that. Say, "Our Seok Jin".

628
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,330
- "Our Seok Jin".
 -  "Our Seok Jin".

629
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm back in my middle school days.

630
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,670
- He's in middle school.
 -  I'm in middle school right now.

631
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,010
So "Our Seok Jin" has a mission.

632
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,000
First, he needs to buy...

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,380
everyone here lunch.

634
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,650
That sounds good.

635
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,140
Is this his mission?

636
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,800
- Wait.
 -  Jee Seok Jin!

637
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,670
- Jee Seok Jin!
 -  Jee Seok Jin!

638
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,570
- Jee Seok Jin!
 -  "Our Seok Jin"!

639
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,900
- Our...
 -  Seok Jin!

640
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
- Our Seok Jin!
 -  All right, then.

641
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,570
- Have you eaten?
 -  No!

642
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,430
It's all on me today.

643
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,630
(Lunch is on Seok Jin!)

644
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,010
It's on me.

645
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,770
Seok Jin will pay for lunch as Ms Yeom's former student.

646
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,630
- They're burgers.
 -  It's for lunch.

647
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,130
(This is Seok Jin's gift for her students.)

648
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,270
Please hand them out.

649
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,640
It's so nice to see you again.

650
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,430
Thanks for visiting me.

651
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,750
Don't mention it.

652
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,980
These are French fries.

653
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,410
- Enjoy your meal.
 -  I will hand them out.

654
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,380
This is so heartwarming.

655
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,870
We would have prepared something better if we had more time.

656
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,500
- We don't have much time.
 -  Take them.

657
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,640
Who didn't get one?

658
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,070
- Thank you.
 -  The French fries...

659
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,210
We have something for you.

660
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,030
This is a necklace.

661
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,770
(This is a gift for the guest.)

662
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,100
- Doesn't it open?
 -  It does.

663
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,230
This is the R mark for Running Man. It's gold.

664
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,070
(The necklace has a photo of Seok Jin and her.)

665
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,270
Ms Yeom, you can lose the photo, but don't lose the gold R mark.

666
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,470
(She can lose the picture but not the gold.)

667
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,500
Please be good to Ms Yeom.

668
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,930
- Okay!
 -  Yes!

669
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,030
(Please be good to her like I was.)

670
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,630
- Goodness, "Our Seok Jin".
 -  Can you take one for us?

671
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,390
- Our...
 -  Seok Jin!

672
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,480
(Seven Loves)

673
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,230
Oksu-dong is the closest from here.

674
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,100
Let's go there, then. Who has to go there?

675
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,770
- It's Ji Hyo.
 -  Yes, it's me.

676
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,480
Oh, it's you. Do you know whom you are expecting?

677
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,170
It's a friend who took acting lessons with me.

678
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,400
(It's someone who took acting classes with her.)

679
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,070
I took lessons from Kim Su Ro back then.

680
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,170
That's right.

681
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,000
He had a close friend...

682
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,370
who lived neared the mountaintop of Oksu-dong.

683
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,070
- I remember now.
 -  I used to climb up the mountain...

684
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,430
to take lessons from him, but I often got hungry and tired.

685
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,430
So at his house,

686
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,770
I used to go through his fridge and eat his food.

687
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,180
I used to take naps there, too. That's what I recall.

688
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,380
- You slept then, too?
 -  She used to take naps.

689
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,440
Then I would just read a page and finish my lesson.

690
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,930
- This is making me so nervous.
 -  It does.

691
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,580
- It does make you nervous.
 -  I wonder who it is.

692
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm really curious.

693
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,070
(Ji Hyo's first love...)

694
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,240
(makes an appearance.)

695
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,980
- Oh, dear! Oh my, oh my!
 -  It must be her friend.

696
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,280
(Everyone gets up.)

697
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,970
It's you, Young Sun!

698
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,360
- Oh, dear. How could this be?
 -  She's beautiful.

699
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,980
- Oh, dear. How could this be?
 -  Hello.

700
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,030
- She has a daughter.
 -  Hello.

701
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,830
- She was part of Redsox.
 -  That's right!

702
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,480
I saw her when I was serving in the army.

703
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,760
You saw her?

704
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,210
- When did you get married?
 -  That's amazing.

705
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,130
- Please, have a seat.
 -  Hello.

706
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,210
- Your daughter is so pretty.
 -  She is.

707
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,600
She's so pretty. I could have never imagined this.

708
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,030
- I think it's been...
 -  15 years?

709
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,300
I think so. It's been 15 years.

710
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,500
Haven't we met each other on "X-Man"?

711
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
You're right.

712
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,830
- Was she on "X-Man"?
 -  She was.

713
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,130
- We used to work together.
 -  Right.

714
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,440
(Who is Chae Young In exactly?)

715
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,340
(She made her debut in 2005 as a member of Redsox.)

716
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,120
(Not only was she a singer, but she was also an actress.)

717
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,980
(She was in various dramas...)

718
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,380
(such as "Damo" and "Temptation of Wife".)

719
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,000
- She debuted earlier than I did.
 -  Really?

720
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,520
You debuted on television a lot earlier than I did.

721
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,270
- And then...
 -  Redsox was famous in the army.

722
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,430
- Both of us made our debut...
 -  Really?

723
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,900
Really?

724
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,020
(Kwang Soo hums Redsox's song.)

725
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,400
- Which year was it?
 -  That's "Sweet Dream".

726
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,720
- I remember that song.
 -  Back then,

727
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
- I woke up listening her song.
 -  Oh my goodness.

728
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,220
You were dressed in red in the music video.

729
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,100
I guess you were a big fan of mine...

730
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,610
among the Redsox members.

731
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,070
Well... That's...

732
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,330
- He must've been.
 -  That's right.

733
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,330
I guess Young Sun is here...

734
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,300
not to see Ji Hyo, but to recollect memories.

735
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,210
Memories of the time when she was a member of Redsox.

736
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,030
- Was the name of the group, Redsox?
 -  Yes.

737
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,800
- Yes, that's right.
 -  Do you remember the choreography?

738
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,280
- Oh, my.
 -  I guess you do.

739
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,630
(She shakes her head coyly.)

740
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,870
(This must've been her charm back then.)

741
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,720
- Look.
 -  Can't you remember?

742
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,530
- I guess you do.
 -  Me, too.

743
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,200
Even if you don't you do, once the music comes out,

744
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
- you'll remember.
 -  Your body will remember.

745
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
- That's not true.
 -  Let's see for ourselves.

746
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,900
(Let's play the music.)

747
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,280
(Oh, my.)

748
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,370
(Onto the stage, Young Sun.)

749
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,880
Redsox!

750
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,050
Let me summon Redsox...

751
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,370
from your memories.

752
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,470
(He still remembers the dance moves.)

753
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,310
- That's right!
 -  It is?

754
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,300
(Kwang Soo is like a member of Redsox.)

755
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,640
This was how I danced.

756
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,140
(Shy)

757
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,710
(She begins singing and dancing.)

758
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,270
I don't know. I don't remember.

759
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,780
(The music makes her dance automatically.)

760
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,980
(Even if she doesn't remember, her body still does.)

761
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,400
(It has been 10 years,)

762
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
She still remembers.

763
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,780
(But she remembers it like it was yesterday.)

764
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,000
- There she goes.
 -  That's it.

765
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,770
- Nice.
 -  That's it!

766
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,640
- She remembers.
 -  That's right.

767
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,680
- Redsox!
 -  My memories are coming back!

768
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,540
(She is on point.)

769
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,780
(She dances just as great and lively as she did back then.)

770
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,010
Am I dancing correctly?

771
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,600
Give her a round of applause!

772
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,170
(She's still an amazing dancer.)

773
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,050
- Oh my goodness!
 -  That was good.

774
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,400
- You still remember the moves.
 -  That's right.

775
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,430
Do you have any special memories 15 years ago...

776
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,200
with Ji Hyo?

777
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,570
Back then, we didn't have...

778
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,230
serious conversations...

779
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,100
- Not about acting.
 -  about acting.

780
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,700
- We were just young.
 -  What did you talk about the most?

781
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,680
About men.

782
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,640
- I thought you had no interest?
 -  She was interested in men!

783
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,930
- Look.
 -  You said that your first love...

784
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,770
- You said it was a teacher.
 -  She said she wasn't interested.

785
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,570
- Optimus Prime was your ideal guy.
 -  Of course... Of course...

786
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,170
I had a boyfriend. I meant I wasn't interested in other men.

787
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,930
- You had a boyfriend since then?
 -  Look.

788
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,500
- That's how I felt with Seung Joon.
 -  He was really famous.

789
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,310
- Her ex-boyfriend was famous.
 -  Was he?

790
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,130
(Ji Hyo was in a relationship with a celebrity 15 years ago.)

791
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,630
She heard about my history but never told me anything.

792
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,670
- I shouldn't have said that.
 -  I can't believe it.

793
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,800
Let's look into Ji Hyo's past.

794
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,330
- Is he still famous?
 -  This was before she debuted.

795
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,730
All of you may know him...

796
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,930
- if I say his name.
 -  Really?

797
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,000
- Don't hide your past, Ji Hyo.
 -  What's going on?

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,070
- So you were interested in men.
 -  Gladly, she was.

799
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,370
- That's a relief.
 -  All right. Young Sun is here now.

800
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,790
So what is their mission?

801
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,210
It's called "First Episode of the Temptation of Running Man."

802
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,030
(In 100 seconds, they have to read a script of "Temptation of Wife".)

803
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,630
(They need to shout loudly. It must be louder than 120dB.)

804
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,670
(Then, they have to tear off three post-its without using their hands.)

805
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,410
(Finally, two people must catch a ball in mid-air.)

806
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,030
- Are you ready?
 -  Yes, I am.

807
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,180
Ready and go.

808
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,410
"Are you really going to go through with this marriage?"

809
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,900
"You borrowed my name and lived well."

810
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,680
"Aren't you too greedy?"

811
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,050
"I'm sorry, Young Sun. Please bless our wedding for him at least."

812
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,010
"What? Bless?"

813
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,710
"I don't think that'll be possible."

814
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,880
Cheon Seong Im!

815
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,700
(That was really loud.)

816
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,830
Can I see? That is beyond my expectation!

817
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,600
- It's over!
 -  Is it?

818
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,060
(How loud was her screaming?)

819
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,080
- 137.
 -  It's 137 dB.

820
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,070
That's amazing!

821
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,130
(She knows how to be loud.)

822
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,600
- "Please don't do this."
 -  "Please let me go."

823
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,430
"I won't. You must suffer as much as I have suffered until now!"

824
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,100
- "Just let me go!"
 -  That's good!

825
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,280
- You're doing well.
 -  Keep the pace.

826
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,380
That's good.

827
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,100
- All right. Tear them off.
 -  Hurry.

828
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,230
- One is stuck on your hair.
 -  Good job.

829
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,800
"Ji Hyo, now we can be happy forever. I'll make that come true."

830
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,240
"Thank you, Kwang Soo."

831
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,420
That's it.

832
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,650
(Today, they have 12 hours to find 7 loves.)

833
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,610
(They need to complete their missions as quickly as they can.)

834
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,210
- That's it.
 -  No!

835
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,430
- Pick up the ball.
 -  Hurry up.

836
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,880
- Once again!
 -  Hurry.

837
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,350
(They're running out of time. This is their last chance.)

838
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,850
(Second attempt)

839
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,240
- It's going to work.
 -  They did it!

840
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,410
Well done. How long did it take?

841
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,030
- How long was it?
 -  It took 1 minute and 28 seconds.

842
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,990
- Yes!
 -  It's done!

843
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,280
(They have cleared their mission.)

844
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,600
That was amazing.

845
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,230
You're a great actress.

846
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,830
Your acting was so nice.

847
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,410
- Your scream was so loud.
 -  I called out your real name.

848
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,240
- That was loud.
 -  Seriously.

849
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,400
- She's really talented.
 -  She is.

850
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,120
Again, we'd like to celebrate...

851
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,270
- the reunion of the two women.
 -  Congratulations!

852
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,410
- That was great!
 -  Let's take a photo together.

853
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,640
(Seven Loves)

854
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,030
(Next is Haha.)

855
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,500
- Who is your guest?
 -  Honestly, I have no idea.

856
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,800
I really don't.

857
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,630
Haha wrote out so many names.

858
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,410
(Haha wrote out so many names.)

859
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,780
(Among them, who is his love?)

860
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,700
(Where are they?)

861
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
- Where is this place?
 -  It's huge.

862
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,140
- Hey, Haha.
 -  This is a stage.

863
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,730
(They are preparing for a rehearsal.)

864
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,100
I feel so nervous.

865
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,820
Maybe that person will make a musical entrance.

866
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,630
- I don't know.
 -  I see.

867
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,610
- I really have no idea.
 -  Every day

868
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,330
(Who is waiting for Haha?)

869
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,340
Stop it. Jae Seok.

870
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,480
- Isn't he Lee Moon Sae?
 -  He is!

871
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,370
(It's Lee Moon Sae!)

872
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,560
He is!

873
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,940
- Isn't he Lee Moon Sae?
 -  It really is him.

874
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,070
- You wrote his name.
 -  Come over.

875
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,970
- Moon Sae.
 -  Are you my love?

876
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,840
- Oh, my.
 -  Really?

877
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,990
(Haha's love is the famous singer, Lee Moon Sae.)

878
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,490
(He has been a passionate singer for the past 39 years.)

879
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,410
(He is a famous and beloved singer in Korea.)

880
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,700
I heard that Haha was coming while I was preparing for a rehearsal.

881
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,630
- Did you say it's about influence?
 -  Yes, that's right.

882
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,940
- When I heard he was coming,
 -  I really mean it.

883
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,330
- I thought he was coming alone.
 -  Did you?

884
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,190
Yes. And we've met last year.

885
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,300
- When I released my album.
 -  That's right.

886
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,900
Haha appeared as a surprise guest at the showcase.

887
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,270
I was so thankful. It's hard to forget.

888
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,520
- Do you contact each other often?
 -  Yes, I do call him.

889
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,980
Thanks to Haha,

890
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,570
I'm able to see you all today. I wanted to meet everyone.

891
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,670
It feels like a mission for myself is accomplished already.

892
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,070
We have a mission that needs to be accomplished for Haha to succeed.

893
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,380
This is Haha's mission.

894
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,470
Lee Moon Sae will choose a song and Haha must sing it.

895
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,940
Then, Haha needs to hear a specific comment from him.

896
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,200
It sounds really difficult.

897
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,570
Please choose a song.

898
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,880
- Among my songs?
 -  There are so many of them.

899
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,590
- How about "Girl"?
 -  "Girl" sounds good.

900
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,340
- Haha loves to sing "Girl".
 -  Honestly,

901
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,350
- I sang "Girl" more than 500 times.
 -  I sang 12,000 times.

902
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,090
No way. You didn't.

903
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,580
Even I haven't sung it that much.

904
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,030
- You don't have to lower the key.
 -  I really enjoy this song.

905
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,880
- I won't lower the key.
 -  Don't shout out too early.

906
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,300
- It's my favourite song.
 -  It's my favourite.

907
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,240
- That looks nice.
 -  I remember all the lyrics.

908
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,540
(The mission begins.)

909
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,720
(Haha is trying to sing and even look like Moon Sae.)

910
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,570
(Haha shouldn't fail the mission.)

911
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,780
I get it, he's mimicking.

912
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,710
- You get how he's mimicking, right?
 -  Loneliness

913
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,810
(Haha is immersed in his singing.)

914
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,910
(He is worried.)

915
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,040
(That's not the "Girl" I used to listen to.)

916
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,610
(Jae Seok suddenly stands up...)

917
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,170
(and grabs the microphone.)

918
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,340
That's not how you sing the song.

919
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,510
(Jae Seok's singing is probably similar to Haha.)

920
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,030
Don't cry in loneliness

921
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,100
(Are you listening, Moon Sae?)

922
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,710
Oh my gosh, it's so great!

923
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,830
(Jae Seok is running out of patience.)

924
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,880
(Again, he takes the microphone away from Haha.)

925
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,480
(Seok Jin wants to sing the song, too.)

926
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,140
(Jae Seok unplugs the microphone.)

927
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,740
(Why isn't the microphone working?)

928
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,570
What is this?

929
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,370
(The stage has become a mess.)

930
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,540
This is my song. Lee Moon Sae told me.

931
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,910
That was funny.

932
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,530
- Wouldn't it be more difficult?
 -  No.

933
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,180
- We need to listen to him sing?
 -  Again?

934
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,520
- We'll sing "Old Love".
 -  "Old Love" sounds really nice.

935
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,210
- It goes like this.
 -  I'll begin my second mission.

936
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,600
(Haha begins without any music.)

937
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,610
- Hold on.
 -  You need to pass the microphone.

938
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,110
(Haha doesn't listen and continues his mission.)

939
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,380
(It's your turn, Moon Sae.)

940
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,780
What is this?

941
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,500
That was too sudden.

942
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,570
Moon Sae, I know you are doing this intentionally.

943
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,900
I don't have much time. I want to stay, but...

944
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,870
You're here because you wanted to see him and now you don't have time.

945
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,270
- Do you have to go?
 -  He's taking too much time.

946
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,010
- He's a busy man.
 -  What are you doing?

947
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,380
It's been a year since I've appeared on television.

948
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,770
I'm finally on television again,

949
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,030
but you're going to leave after the mission?

950
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,570
- That's not it.
 -  That's terrible.

951
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,640
- I have to watch your performance.
 -  For this song,

952
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,500
- I will give you one tip.
 -  Okay.

953
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,940
(He gives a tip so they can quickly succeed.)

954
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,220
- Don't try to mimic me.
 -  Of course.

955
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,690
And don't worry about singing well.

956
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,730
Just think about how you will deliver the lyrics well.

957
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,530
- Right.
 -  That's what you should do.

958
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,940
That's what I think when I sing this song.

959
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,140
- Me, too.
 -  I always think like that.

960
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,630
It's my first time seeing Haha sweating like this.

961
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,770
- I know.
 -  Right?

962
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,440
It's really embarrassing for me to sing a song I love in front of...

963
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,370
- a person whom I really admire.
 -  Right.

964
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,630
- All right.
 -  Cue.

965
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,790
(He gives the mission another try.)

966
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,600
(The time is passing quickly.)

967
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,240
(Will he be able to complete the mission with his role model?)

968
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,740
(Moon Sae continues naturally.)

969
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,390
(Haha succeeds.)

970
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,280
(The mission is over, but he wants to keep listening.)

971
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,910
It's nice.

972
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,300
(It's an overwhelming moment regardless of the mission.)

973
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,630
- That's it.
 -  That's good.

974
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,080
- So...
 -  The mission is cleared.

975
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,060
- What was the mission?
 -  It was singing in relay.

976
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,440
Singing in relay.

977
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,500
That's so easy.

978
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,580
But I'm glad he did it.

979
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,470
- He has a concert coming up.
 -  Right.

980
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,100
- He has to reserve his voice.
 -  He shouldn't be singing.

981
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,000
By the way, have you ever seen Running Man?

982
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
- Of course.
 -  Is that right?

983
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,370
I should rip someone's name tag one day.

984
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,770
(He wants to be on Running Man one day.)

985
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,440
The more we think about it,

986
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,860
the more we are touched by the lyrics and the song.

987
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,170
His songs have a special place in our memories, and we hope he will...

988
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,670
continue to sing great songs.

989
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,010
- Let's clap for him.
 -  Thank you.

990
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,040
Thank you!

991
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,110
Thank you! It was an honour!

992
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,840
(Seven Loves)

993
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,610
Who's in here?

994
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,000
(There is a woman calmly waiting for the members.)

995
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,560
(Who is she?)

996
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,870
(He's the one and only love of Jong Kook.)

997
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,010
(Who can she be?)

998
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,630
Mother!

999
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,000
- Hello.
 -  Goodness.

1000
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,200
- She's Jong Kook's mother.
 -  Hello.

1001
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
It's been a long time.

1002
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,630
- Mother.
 -  It's Jong Kook's mother.

1003
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,130
Yes, hello.

1004
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,600
- Hello.
 -  You all look very handsome.

1005
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,890
Hello, Mother.

1006
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,030
Why is my mother here?

1007
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,230
- What's going on?
 -  She's Jong Kook's mother.

1008
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,370
- Mum!
 -  Jong Kook.

1009
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,080
- Hello.
 -  She's Jong Kook's mum.

1010
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,600
You look beautiful today.

1011
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,570
- Where did you get your hair done?
 -  I also thought...

1012
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,600
- My hair is naturally like this.
 -  It looks very nice.

1013
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,380
Don't lie. I've seen your natural state.

1014
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,840
(What kind of son is Jong Kook?)

1015
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,100
I want to give this to other people.

1016
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,310
I want to take it to my mother.

1017
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,300
Usually, guys don't go to an arcade with their mother.

1018
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
I often go to the movies with my mum.

1019
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,470
- Right.
 -  He's very caring of his mother.

1020
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,780
- He's a good son.
 -  Yes.

1021
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,970
Jong Kook chose you as the person he loves the most.

1022
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,200
Oh, dear.

1023
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,130
- By the way, he always...
 -  He should get married.

1024
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,370
- thinks about you.
 -  It's true.

1025
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,730
- Is that right?
 -  He always does.

1026
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,170
- Jong Kook is such a good son.
 -  Really.

1027
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,970
I've never seen such a lovely son.

1028
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,570
We know that you always cook him breakfast.

1029
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,830
- Really.
 -  We hear that...

1030
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,030
he eats breakfast at 3am.

1031
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,470
He has to eat breakfast.

1032
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,530
(He has to eat breakfast, no matter what.)

1033
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,710
So we always tell him...

1034
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,310
- to stop torturing you.
 -  I know.

1035
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,870
- We tell him to get married.
 -  Get married soon.

1036
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,800
I know. I want him to get married soon.

1037
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,450
What kind of woman would you like as a daughter-in-law?

1038
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,170
The toughest condition is that...

1039
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,380
she has to cook well.

1040
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,310
Look at that.

1041
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,830
- Right.
 -  Goodness.

1042
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,940
She has to be able to cook at three in the morning.

1043
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,310
Because he has to eat breakfast every day.

1044
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,580
What kind of son is he at home?

1045
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,200
I am curious.

1046
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,760
Since we don't have a daughter,

1047
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,470
he's been like a daughter in our family.

1048
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,670
Like a daughter.

1049
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,800
Like a daughter?

1050
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,580
- Is he adorable?
 -  Is he really?

1051
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,170
- Jong Kook?
 -  Like a daughter?

1052
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,270
I am the daughter in my family.

1053
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,870
- Does he act cute?
 -  I'm like a daughter.

1054
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,950
- We'd never think of him like that.
 -  He's like a daughter.

1055
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,830
So you release the stress when you are outside.

1056
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,590
So he's different when he's at home and when he's outside.

1057
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,280
Does he ever act cute?

1058
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,000
- He acts really cute with her.
 -  At home?

1059
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,830
One time, they were in a hotel room together.

1060
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,510
And Jong Kook danced liked this in front of her.

1061
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,300
- Really.
 -  When did I do that?

1062
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,030
- He really did that.
 -  What are you talking about?

1063
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,360
Did he cause a lot of trouble when he was in school?

1064
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,130
No, he didn't cause much trouble.

1065
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,030
- Because he's your son.
 -  Gosh, mother.

1066
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,230
- That means you've been lying.
 -  Please don't do that.

1067
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,730
We can help you to a certain point.

1068
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,270
- The entire nation knows of him.
 -  We all know how he is.

1069
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,690
She's his mother for sure.

1070
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,170
Since I was young,

1071
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,700
I was a compassionate boy.

1072
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,950
- He's right.
 -  I was a really good kid.

1073
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,810
He always asked me to pack two lunch boxes.

1074
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,730
He gave one to his friend who couldn't bring one.

1075
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,940
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1076
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,870
- I was a really compassionate boy.
 -  He was a good boy.

1077
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,600
(Jong Kook was compassionate and kind.)

1078
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,110
It was just the bad people.

1079
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,470
I only hated the bad people.

1080
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,310
- I hated the bad people.
 -  Gosh.

1081
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,270
(I can't bear this.)

1082
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,900
- He's right.
 -  My goodness.

1083
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,870
- It's really...
 -  We don't know what to say.

1084
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,440
- I'm so confused now.
 -  Of course Jong Kook...

1085
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,370
- is a compassionate person.
 -  But it's true.

1086
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,130
If his weak friend gets beaten by another kid,

1087
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,330
he always sided with his friend and took revenge.

1088
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,720
He sided with his weak friends.

1089
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,900
- Right.
 -  I wasn't...

1090
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,570
someone who bullied weak people.

1091
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,930
- Right.
 -  I couldn't stand injustice.

1092
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,280
You couldn't stand injustice.

1093
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,880
The mission Jong Kook will clear with his mother is...

1094
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,250
cooking for...

1095
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,120
his mother.

1096
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,300
He cooks well.

1097
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,230
And he has to write a handwritten letter.

1098
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,000
(He needs to write a letter.)

1099
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,070
A handwritten letter?

1100
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,840
(Manly Jong Kook must write a handwritten letter.)

1101
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,010
My mother is flustered.

1102
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,680
What do we do?

1103
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,730
(He enters the kitchen.)

1104
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,240
I need medicinal herbs.

1105
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,770
(He checks the ingredients in the refrigerator.)

1106
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,900
It's here.

1107
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,590
(Checking)

1108
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,000
There you go.

1109
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,310
(What will he cook for his mother?)

1110
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,930
Mother, Jong Kook has to get married now.

1111
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,700
I know. If he can't get married,

1112
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,880
I hope he will at least get me a grandchild first.

1113
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,810
You are right.

1114
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,710
- She'd like grandchildren.
 -  I want a grandchild.

1115
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,330
She wants to see her grandchildren acting cute.

1116
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,470
- Right.
 -  Yes.

1117
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,640
- I'm getting old.
 -  We always say...

1118
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,270
that Jong Kook's mother is the best mother in the nation.

1119
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,300
- Gosh, you're too kind.
 -  Your first son is a surgeon.

1120
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,630
- Gosh...
 -  He's a plastic surgeon.

1121
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,430
- And your second son is a star.
 -  She has Jong Kook, too.

1122
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,800
(She raised her sons well.)

1123
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,170
- Really.
 -  Aren't you happy?

1124
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,800
(She must be happy just looking at her sons.)

1125
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,100
Of course, I'm happy.

1126
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,200
As long as you do your best with your work,

1127
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,610
you are all number one daughters and sons.

1128
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,920
Did you bring some photos?

1129
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,610
I brought Jong Kook's childhood photos.

1130
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,630
- You were big.
 -  Goodness.

1131
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,200
- That was from middle school.
 -  Right.

1132
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,520
That was my middle school graduation day.

1133
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,330
- You went on an outing.
 -  Mother, you were...

1134
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,490
(She was always there for him.)

1135
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,940
You were a beauty when you were young.

1136
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,660
- She was beautiful.
 -  Oh, dear.

1137
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,740
Her eyes were big and pretty.

1138
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,470
- And she is always smiling.
 -  Right.

1139
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,430
- She always smiles.
 -  Whenever someone calls,

1140
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,130
- Do you smile?
 -  I always start with a laugh.

1141
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,600
How? I will pretend to call you.

1142
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,940
I always do that to everyone.

1143
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,730
Hello.

1144
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,010
(Bursting into laughter)

1145
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,110
- Do you really do that?
 -  Right away?

1146
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,360
- Yes.
 -  You just laugh.

1147
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,670
I do.

1148
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,030
- That's very nice.
 -  She's amazing.

1149
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,470
- It puts you in a good mood.
 -  I laugh all day.

1150
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,200
Whoever becomes Jong Kook's wife...

1151
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,880
is going to be very happy.

1152
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,040
- That's right.
 -  She'll be a great mother-in-law.

1153
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,970
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is doing the mission in the kitchen.)

1154
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,300
(Today's menu is samgyetang.)

1155
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,380
I will add sticky rice.

1156
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,830
(He won a cooking competition before.)

1157
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,510
Don't I have to add things like chestnuts?

1158
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,230
Garlic.

1159
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,730
(He puts great effort into the dish for his mother.)

1160
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,910
Do we have chestnuts?

1161
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:13,910
Go inside.

1162
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,130
Do we not have chestnuts?

1163
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,970
(He stuffed the chicken nicely. Now, he must boil it.)

1164
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,510
The chicken is too big.

1165
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,370
(While the chicken is cooking in the pot,)

1166
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,440
(Jong Kook writes a letter.)

1167
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:32,780
(Because he's been busy, he hasn't written a letter for a long time.)

1168
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,510
(With his large hands, he slowly fills the paper with his words.)

1169
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,330
(Jong Kook's samgyetang is complete.)

1170
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,780
(He tastes it.)

1171
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,740
It's amazing.

1172
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,310
How did it turn out so nicely?

1173
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,780
I cook samgyetang really well.

1174
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,810
Shall we bring it out?

1175
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,210
Jong Kook's confident about his food.

1176
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,170
- Gosh.
 -  You must've tasted it before.

1177
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,810
Jong Kook is a good cook.

1178
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,370
- We will acknowledge it.
 -  I...

1179
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,530
- really...
 -  He's a professional.

1180
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,100
It looks just like the samgyetang he cooked before.

1181
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,200
I...

1182
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,710
- You cooked it well.
 -  I really am...

1183
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,930
- good at cooking samgyetang.
 -  I know.

1184
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,070
Is it good?

1185
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,710
- Open it.
 -  It's amazing.

1186
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,170
You won't believe it.

1187
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,680
- He'll make a great husband.
 -  But really.

1188
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,330
I cook samgyetang really well.

1189
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,330
- Look at that!
 -  I cooked it really well.

1190
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,670
I think he cooked it well.

1191
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,380
- She will...
 -  I didn't add any salt.

1192
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,420
- So it might be bland.
 -  Please have a seat.

1193
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,280
That looks amazing.

1194
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,780
It's mouth-watering.

1195
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,740
Goodness.

1196
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,900
- You should serve it for her.
 -  Like a queen.

1197
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,980
Taste it.

1198
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,700
(He worries that she will burn her tongue.)

1199
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,240
It's hot. Blow on it.

1200
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,930
He's sweet like this.

1201
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,300
(Jong Kook's a sweetheart.)

1202
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,630
(She doesn't forget to brag.)

1203
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,710
Oh, dear.

1204
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,900
She can't stop bragging about her son.

1205
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,240
My goodness.

1206
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,400
(She tries the samgyetang that Jong Kook cooked for her.)

1207
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,030
- How is it?
 -  It's really delicious.

1208
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,300
It's rich.

1209
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,580
- Is it good?
 -  Yes.

1210
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,610
- It's amazing, isn't it?
 -  It's much better than mine.

1211
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,860
- It's better than your samgyetang?
 -  Yes.

1212
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,080
What's for sure is that he cooks better than my mum does.

1213
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,830
- Did you write the letter?
 -  What?

1214
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,200
The letter.

1215
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,910
Now, you should write the letter.

1216
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,370
- I wrote it.
 -  She...

1217
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:23,020
- When did you write it?
 -  I saw him writing it.

1218
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,930
- He wrote two pages.
 -  Is it too bland?

1219
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,590
I wrote a little more than a page.

1220
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,440
Okay.

1221
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,810
"Dear Mother".

1222
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,480
"Mother, this is your youngest son, Jong Kook."

1223
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,400
"I always try to be a good son,"

1224
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,810
"but I've never given you a handwritten letter."

1225
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,040
"When I was young, I used to be a troublemaker and make you worry."

1226
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,950
"That's why I wanted to be a good son to you all the more."

1227
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,770
"Father was so strict..."

1228
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,300
"and frugal, so you had a difficult time."

1229
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,580
"Watching you while growing up, I wanted to become successful..."

1230
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,410
"so that I could give you everything good in this world."

1231
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,970
"Whenever I told you this, you would be surprised."

1232
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,380
"And you would laugh, saying that I won't be able to do it."

1233
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:12,440
"But you always wanted to live with me and not my brother."

1234
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,730
"You said your older son was too absorbed in his studies."

1235
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,600
(Her eldest son wasn't very affectionate.)

1236
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,030
"Mother, thank you for taking care..."

1237
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,640
"of me to this age. I feel bad, but I'm very appreciative."

1238
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,700
"I'm always trying to be a good son and a good person."

1239
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,030
"I'll get married soon so that I can take care of you instead."

1240
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,300
- That's right.
 -  "Please be healthy."

1241
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,800
"Be healthy for a long time and experience everything good."

1242
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,340
"Let me be a good son to you as long as I can."

1243
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,230
"I have a lot more to say, but I'll show you by being a good son."

1244
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,700
"Thank you for everything and I love you. From your son, Jong Kook."

1245
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,090
(Thank you for everything, Mum. I love you.)

1246
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,130
Goodness, Mother.

1247
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,680
- It's making me tear up.
 -  I know, right?

1248
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,070
While I was reading this, I got emotional.

1249
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,040
- So I read it quickly.
 -  You were tearing up.

1250
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,080
- I know how he feels now.
 -  It's a handwritten letter.

1251
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,080
Thank you.

1252
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,730
Be healthy, Mother.

1253
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,280
Thank you.

1254
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,400
(Be healthy, Mother.)

1255
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,370
(Jong Kook is a lovable son.)

1256
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,430
- Isn't he like a daughter?
 -  Yes, he is.

1257
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,010
- I'm so envious.
 -  You should do the same for us.

1258
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,830
- He rips our clothes.
 -  He bites us.

1259
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,230
He bites us, too. That's how he is.

1260
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,470
There is no part of me that's unscathed.

1261
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,040
He should do the same for you, too.

1262
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,370
He should say that he loves us.

1263
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,600
(The mother and son take a picture.)

1264
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,710
In 1, 2, 3.

1265
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,980
(Jong Kook completes his mission with his mother.)

1266
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,200
(Seven Loves)

1267
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,490
I got her number from my mum.

1268
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,740
- Really?
 -  Yes, she was my first girlfriend.

1269
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,920
- We got it.
 -  It was since kindergarten.

1270
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,270
It might work.

1271
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,370
- I have to find someone.
 -  Gary, just...

1272
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,740
- pick anybody.
 -  Should I give her a call?

1273
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,860
Try calling her.

1274
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,270
- I'm getting worried.
 -  How long has it been? 30 years?

1275
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,210
I've never called her before.

1276
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,910
And if I see her today,

1277
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,070
- Is it 20 years?
 -  it will be around 25 years.

1278
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,780
Try calling her. Let's hear her voice.

1279
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,080
He's calling her.

1280
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,630
Just from the sound of the ringtone...

1281
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,530
Hello?

1282
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:25,970
(He hears her voice over the phone.)

1283
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,730
(It's been 25 years since he spoke to his first love.)

1284
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,510
- Hello?
 -  Yes?

1285
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,510
Is this Hye Jin, by any chance?

1286
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,040
- Yes.
 -  Oh, hi.

1287
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,930
(It's a heart-fluttering moment.)

1288
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,180
He said, "Hi".

1289
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,010
My name is Lee Kwang Soo.

1290
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,830
Oh, King Kong!

1291
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,030
King Kong!

1292
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,430
King Kong? He was the ugly one.

1293
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,670
- He was tall and ugly.
 -  Tall and ugly.

1294
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,880
- He was tall and ugly.
 -  You must have been my girlfriend.

1295
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,550
- Hello?
 -  Yes.

1296
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,720
- Hye Jin.
 -  What?

1297
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,010
- How have you been?
 -  Good. Hi.

1298
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,930
- I'm curious.
 -  "Good. Hi".

1299
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,910
According to Kwang Soo, you were his first girlfriend.

1300
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,340
- Was I?
 -  Yes, you were.

1301
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,600
I think so.

1302
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,330
Is he right?

1303
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,200
Can we go see you in a bit?

1304
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,630
- Sure.
 -  As a prelude to our meeting,

1305
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,080
can you tell us what kind of friend Kwang Soo was?

1306
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,440
He was ugly.

1307
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,700
(His first girlfriend confirms that he was ugly.)

1308
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,690
You are so funny. See you later, Hye Jin.

1309
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,040
- Sure.
 -  Bye.

1310
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,730
She's very blunt.

1311
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,300
- She sounds funny.
 -  Her voice hasn't changed.

1312
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,430
- Really?
 -  It's husky.

1313
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,770
It's going to be fun. Remember what you said, Kwang Soo?

1314
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,100
You said something good might happen today.

1315
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,380
To be honest, I like women who are overpowering.

1316
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,870
You never know what's going to happen today.

1317
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,360
- Kwang Soo is single at the moment.
 -  Right.

1318
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,870
Everything about this situation is perfect.

1319
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,470
- It's a perfect situation.
 -  This is great, Kwang Soo.

1320
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,500
- You must be excited.
 -  When I spoke to her,

1321
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,330
- She seemed candid.
 -  she sounded very straightforward.

1322
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:11,030
We are finally 1km away from meeting Hye Jin.

1323
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,470
You must be really excited.

1324
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,800
None of the other meetings felt like this today.

1325
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Kwang Soo must be nervous right now.

1326
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,500
You should prepare what you're going to say.

1327
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,770
- Let's practise it.
 -  Practise in front of the mirror.

1328
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,030
- Try it. Look at the mirror.
 -  Hello, Hye Jin.

1329
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,600
- Try another one.
 -  That sounds awkward.

1330
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,030
Try to sound cool.

1331
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,200
- How have you been, Hye Jin?
 -  Good one.

1332
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,360
- It sounds weird, too.
 -  It's awkward.

1333
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,700
(Kwang Soo's first love)

1334
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,830
- I'm curious.
 -  I'm very curious.

1335
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,670
(We will soon meet Kwang Soo's first love.)

1336
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,280
It's Kwang Soo's...

1337
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,900
first love, so I'm more curious than ever.

1338
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,130
- Me, too.
 -  I'm getting curious.

1339
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,410
I'm very curious.

1340
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,200
She sounds very easygoing and down-to-earth.

1341
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,970
- I agree.
 -  I'm so curious.

1342
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,430
She seems to have a good personality.

1343
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,900
- There she comes.
 -  Is she coming?

1344
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,100
- It must be her.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1345
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,800
- Can you close your eyes?
 -  It's okay, Kwang Soo.

1346
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
- The door opens
 -  Close your eyes.

1347
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,300
- She's coming in
 -  Better yet, turn around.

1348
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,170
At first sight

1349
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,070
- Turn around.
 -  I knew

1350
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,010
- Turn around.
 -  It was love

1351
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,010
- Get up.
 -  When she came near me

1352
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,540
- Goodness.
 -  Doesn't she look like Ko So Young?

1353
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,040
She wore a pink shirt.

1354
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:26,770
(From childhood friends, they now meet each other as adults.)

1355
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:34,730
(It's been 25 years, but they are still familiar with each other.)

1356
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,330
(How has his first love changed?)

1357
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,600
- Wow.
 -  Hello.

1358
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,570
Kwang Soo, now I know what you meant.

1359
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,000
Hye Jin. Please, come here.

1360
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
- Is this her?
 -  You can guess her personality.

1361
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,670
She does look very cute.

1362
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,740
- She is.
 -  She turned red.

1363
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:52,000
- She's very pretty.
 -  How long has it been?

1364
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,770
- How long has it been?
 -  It's the first time after...

1365
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,670
- seeing him in second grade.
 -  That's right.

1366
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,330
You sound a lot different than when we spoke on the phone.

1367
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,930
- Are you feeling shy?
 -  Yes.

1368
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,080
- You spoke aggressively before.
 -  Your voice hasn't changed.

1369
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,110
Kwang Soo...

1370
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,700
- and...
 -  Was he six years old?

1371
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,950
It was until he was in second grade.

1372
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,510
- She was Kwang Soo's girlfriend.
 -  He was nine years old.

1373
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,640
Please call his name. And Kwang Soo, call her name and turn around.

1374
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,370
Kwang Soo.

1375
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,630
- One more time.
 -  Louder.

1376
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,130
Can we do this one more time?

1377
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,470
Be cute.

1378
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,280
- Kwang Soo.
 -  One more time, please.

1379
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,970
Kwang Soo!

1380
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,270
(She calls out his name after 25 years.)

1381
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:40,510
(Do you remember our good times together?)

1382
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,070
Kwang Soo!

1383
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,270
(It's time to recall those memories.)

1384
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,580
Look.

1385
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,870
(Laughing)

1386
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,190
Ta-da.

1387
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:50,880
(He laughs as soon as he sees her.)

1388
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,310
(Nodding)

1389
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,680
(He can't stand the awkwardness.)

1390
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,270
- You turned around and did this.
 -  Hey!

1391
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,430
What was that for?

1392
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:06,080
- We practised before.
 -  He practised his greeting.

1393
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,770
- Try it.
 -  Stroke her hair.

1394
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,420
- How do you feel?
 -  This is amazing.

1395
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,600
"Hello". And then...

1396
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,970
(He tries what he practised.)

1397
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,110
I don't like it.

1398
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,180
(Don't touch me.)

1399
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,040
I told you I wouldn't do this.

1400
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,830
- Do you not like it?
 -  What did I tell you?

1401
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,670
- I don't like physical contact.
 -  Do you not like it?

1402
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,460
- I told you not to do that.
 -  Anyway...

1403
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,530
You guys were young back then, but what kind of kid was Kwang Soo?

1404
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,330
He was very quiet...

1405
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,500
- Was he quiet?
 -  and well-behaved.

1406
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,870
I'm not used to him behaving like this.

1407
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,140
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1408
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,870
(We have changed a lot, but we've met again.)

1409
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:50,510
I was surprised that he still remembered me.

1410
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,500
- Of course I do.
 -  He kept on talking about you.

1411
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,930
- Your sister was Hye Rim, right?
 -  You're right.

1412
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,100
- Was your sister Bo Ram?
 -  And Sung Yoon.

1413
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,230
- Yours was Bo Ram?
 -  It was Sung Yoon, right?

1414
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,580
- You're right.
 -  Right.

1415
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,000
- It's like they've met yesterday.
 -  You lived on the second floor.

1416
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,030
- Right, I did.
 -  We lived on the 2nd and 3rd floor.

1417
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,600
(She hits him.)

1418
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,730
- She's a bit abusive.
 -  Excuse me.

1419
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,670
Didn't you say that you don't like physical contact?

1420
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,000
- That's right.
 -  She punched you. Are you okay?

1421
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,010
- We lived on the 2nd and 3rd floor.
 -  You're right.

1422
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,230
He said you were very popular.

1423
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,840
- I was very popular.
 -  She was popular.

1424
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,970
(She's so frank.)

1425
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,530
- I was very popular.
 -  That's what he said.

1426
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,070
I thought he was going to be disappointed.

1427
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,600
- Why?
 -  I changed a lot.

1428
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,130
- You're beautiful.
 -  You're still beautiful.

1429
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,300
- Was Kwang Soo popular as a child?
 -  No, he wasn't.

1430
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,510
(He wasn't popular.)

1431
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,870
Did any girls like him?

1432
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,970
- No, they didn't.
 -  I was still young.

1433
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:36,400
I heard Kwang Soo used to get beaten up a lot.

1434
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,770
He did. I used to hit the kids who beat him up.

1435
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,070
- Did I really get beaten up?
 -  Don't you remember?

1436
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,800
- Were you a nerd?
 -  No way.

1437
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,110
He calls everyone a nerd.

1438
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,800
- He called me nerd, too.
 -  How am I nerd?

1439
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,790
He called me a nerd for getting kicked by Seung Joon.

1440
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,980
- Goodness.
 -  I remember this.

1441
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,970
There was a small glass window in her house.

1442
00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:00,330
We were both staring out the window...

1443
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,430
- In my house?
 -  Yes.

1444
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,270
- Did you kiss?
 -  We were looking out the window,

1445
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,130
- I remember she kissed my cheek.
 -  Really?

1446
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,670
(I remember her kissing me on the cheek.)

1447
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,110
- Hye Jin did?
 -  Yes.

1448
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:20,640
(Do you remember that moment?)

1449
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,410
No, he's wrong.

1450
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,010
(Hitting)

1451
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,100
- I didn't do it.
 -  She doesn't like physical contact?

1452
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,530
- Hye Jin.
 -  I didn't do it.

1453
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,700
Didn't you say you don't like physical contact?

1454
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,830
- I didn't do it.
 -  You punched him six times.

1455
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,070
Are you two going out?

1456
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,230
- You met yesterday, right?
 -  No, we didn't.

1457
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,470
- Hye Jin.
 -  No, we didn't.

1458
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,110
Do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

1459
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,170
(Do you have a boyfriend?)

1460
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:51,310
(Will they start dating after 25 years?)

1461
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,870
- I am married.
 -  What?

1462
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,410
- Are you really?
 -  Really?

1463
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,470
(I'm married.)

1464
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,700
(It's shocking news.)

1465
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,870
- That's shocking.
 -  Really?

1466
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,400
It's shocking, shocking

1467
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,670
- Did you get married?
 -  You did?

1468
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,870
- Do you have children?
 -  No, I don't.

1469
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,410
- You don't have children.
 -  When did you get married?

1470
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,210
I got married in 2014.

1471
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,700
- I thought she said 14 years ago.
 -  Me, too.

1472
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,720
I thought she said 14 years ago.

1473
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,230
You got married early.

1474
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,380
- So that was two years ago?
 -  Yes.

1475
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,310
- I see.
 -  Does your husband...

1476
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,450
- know you are meeting Kwang Soo?
 -  He does.

1477
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,820
- What did he say?
 -  He told me to get my hair done.

1478
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,230
He wanted you to look nice.

1479
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,110
- He wanted me to go shopping.
 -  He's so nice.

1480
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,780
How did you feel when she said she's married?

1481
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,170
- Well, you know...
 -  Answer me.

1482
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,660
- What?
 -  How did you feel?

1483
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,180
I should congratulate her. What else could I do?

1484
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,530
- He would congratulate her.
 -  That's obvious.

1485
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,700
- What is he supposed to do?
 -  But he would have felt something.

1486
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,370
- He would do the obvious.
 -  She's still his first love.

1487
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,780
He could have felt something when he heard that.

1488
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,300
What do you think about Kwang Soo?

1489
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,030
What type of a girlfriend do you think will suit him?

1490
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,830
Who do you think will suit him?

1491
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,800
She knows my entire family.

1492
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,400
Someone who's good to his parents.

1493
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,440
Why are you tearing up?

1494
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,780
He could have been hers.

1495
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,730
- He could have been hers.
 -  She knows him the best.

1496
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:11,500
Come on.

1497
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,400
I can feel it.

1498
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,130
- Is there...
 -  That's too bad.

1499
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:17,220
a mission for these two?

1500
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,440
Hye Jin lives close by.

1501
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,730
- It's late...
 -  Will he walk her home?

1502
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,770
- He'll take her to her husband...
 -  Do I need to walk her home?

1503
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,810
- safe and soundly.
 -  That sounds good.

1504
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,530
We're friends, anyway.

1505
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,160
While they're doing that, we should move onto Gary.

1506
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,630
I better find somebody.

1507
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,130
- Let's discuss this.
 -  Sure.

1508
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:37,230
Look at the time. You should find somebody.

1509
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,110
We only have an hour left.

1510
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,930
I went back a little while ago.

1511
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,400
- Have you gone there?
 -  Everything was gone.

1512
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,700
- My house was gone, too.
 -  The video store was gone.

1513
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,300
- It was gone.
 -  That's gone, too.

1514
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,480
What about the place that sells snacks?

1515
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,990
- They used to sell this snack.
 -  I used to love that place.

1516
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,510
This feels weird.

1517
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,080
I'm so glad to see you again,

1518
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,380
but it still feels weird. It feels funny.

1519
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,270
I could remember myself when I was younger.

1520
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:09,100
I know, right? We used to go on trips together.

1521
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,980
- I remember how my parents were.
 -  I know.

1522
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,310
- You should go now.
 -  All right.

1523
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,380
- This is her place.
 -  I'll get going.

1524
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,300
Keep in touch.

1525
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,370
- Let me give you a hug.
 -  Bye.

1526
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,730
- Bye.
 -  You, too.

1527
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,140
It was so nice to see you again.

1528
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:31,740
(From 1992 to 2016, they'll continue their memories.)

1529
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,300
Look at the time. You should find somebody.

1530
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,030
We only have an hour left.

1531
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,700
- We can make it until 10:30pm.
 -  We have to keep the time, right?

1532
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,670
- It's until 10:30pm.
 -  That's tight.

1533
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,110
It's still tight.

1534
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,370
- Kwang Soo should meet us there.
 -  You're right.

1535
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,630
- We have to get going.
 -  Let's go.

1536
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,500
All right. We're sorry to Kwang Soo,

1537
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,800
- but he should come by a taxi.
 -  We have to leave him.

1538
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,570
- Tell him to go home.
 -  This mission is important.

1539
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,780
Just tell him to go home.

1540
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,540
They left already.

1541
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,340
Isn't this too much?

1542
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,510
How am I supposed to go back?

1543
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,680
Did they really leave?

1544
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,140
Do I really need to take a taxi?

1545
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,180
Did they really leave?

1546
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,570
(They are going to complete the last mission.)

1547
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,610
Hello.

1548
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,500
We have to aim for 10:15pm.

1549
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,830
(There are 40 minutes left.)

1550
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,100
There's a lot of traffic.

1551
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,050
We have to start the mission as soon as we get there.

1552
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,010
As soon as we arrive, I'll take this camera.

1553
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,580
Are you going to film it yourself?

1554
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,940
(There are 32 minutes left.)

1555
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,940
- Do we go straight?
 -  Yes, keep going.

1556
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,980
Do I keep going?

1557
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,740
Is it this way?

1558
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:48,140
(There are 20 minutes left.)

1559
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:49,970
Where is it?

1560
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,270
(Kwang Soo arrives first.)

1561
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,880
We don't have much time.

1562
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,080
Have they arrived yet?

1563
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,510
Where is it?

1564
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,880
Is no one here yet?

1565
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:06,140
(The last guest is waiting for the members.)

1566
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,500
(It's Yoon Gun.)

1567
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,840
Who is it? Is no one here yet?

1568
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,310
- Didn't they...
 -  Yoon Gun is the last guest.

1569
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,310
They're on their way.

1570
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:20,740
- You should go say hi.
 -  Where's Gary?

1571
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,060
I know him.

1572
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,680
Hello.

1573
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,780
- Hello.
 -  Hello, I got here first.

1574
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,680
- Nice to meet you.
 -  You're tall.

1575
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,500
- Are you on your own?
 -  Yes, I am.

1576
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,410
But we have to finish the mission by 10:30pm.

1577
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,780
We'll receive a penalty if we don't.

1578
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,390
But we can only start when Gary gets here.

1579
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,040
We only have 15 minutes left.

1580
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,960
- Should I just walk there?
 -  Where is it?

1581
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,130
Wait. I'll just get off. It's on the right.

1582
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,870
- Let's just walk there.
 -  We should.

1583
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,200
(Run for it!)

1584
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,280
Let's go.

1585
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:57,390
Gary, hurry up! We have no time!

1586
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,160
We're here.

1587
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,030
(The members arrive 15 minutes before time is up.)

1588
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,100
- He's here.
 -  Start the mission. Hello.

1589
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,300
- Hello.
 -  You are here.

1590
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,730
- Start the mission.
 -  We have no time.

1591
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,730
- We have to finish by 10:30pm.
 -  Go get the mission.

1592
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,870
- Tell him what it is.
 -  Hello.

1593
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:11,970
- Hello.
 -  Hi.

1594
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:15,220
Yoon Gun will make coffee...

1595
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,500
for all seven of you.

1596
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,010
Meanwhile, Gary...

1597
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,870
has to buy five items Gun asks for.

1598
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,600
- Okay, hurry up.
 -  What are they?

1599
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,070
- We don't have time.
 -  I want potato chips.

1600
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,270
All right. I know which one it is.

1601
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,730
- And hot dogs.
 -  Hot dogs?

1602
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,400
Are any hot dogs okay? They take long to make.

1603
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,930
- Diet coke.
 -  Diet coke?

1604
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,830
- Can I request anything?
 -  Just hurry up!

1605
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,700
What about jelly?

1606
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,730
- He wants the old ones.
 -  Do they still sell them?

1607
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,170
- They do still sell them.
 -  And then?

1608
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,960
- Ask for gum.
 -  I want a lollipop.

1609
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,930
That's candy.

1610
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,070
Give me money.

1611
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,700
- Where do I go?
 -  Where can he go for hot dogs?

1612
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,910
We have enough time.

1613
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,910
I have 15 minutes. Where's the convenience store?

1614
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,950
Okay.

1615
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,730
(He finds a convenience store right away.)

1616
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,030
Hello.

1617
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,470
(His first target is the potato chips.)

1618
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,370
(It's on his radar.)

1619
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:11,140
I can't find the specific brand.

1620
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,980
What's next?

1621
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,430
What were they? Lollipops.

1622
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:18,000
(He finds the lollipops.)

1623
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,680
I got the lollipop. Do you sell hot dogs here?

1624
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,880
Where are the hot dogs?

1625
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,170
(He finds the hot dog.)

1626
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,480
What's after the hot dog?

1627
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,500
What was the next one? Here's the jelly.

1628
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,070
(He finds the jelly.)

1629
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,310
What was next?

1630
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,380
I blanked out. I can't remember the next one.

1631
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,810
I can't remember it at all.

1632
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,180
We have 14 minutes left.

1633
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,630
Please make seven cups of coffee...

1634
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,280
in 14 minutes. That's all the time we have.

1635
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,840
I can't remember one. This is driving me insane.

1636
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,570
(Calm down, Gary!)

1637
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,310
Hold on. What was it again?

1638
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,400
It was diet coke!

1639
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,630
(He finds the coke.)

1640
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,840
Here's diet coke.

1641
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,040
Don't you sell the potato chips?

1642
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,880
Do you not sell it here?

1643
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,200
Thank you.

1644
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,570
(They don't sell the potato chips he was looking for.)

1645
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,990
Where should I go? Where?

1646
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:10,680
I have to go to a supermarket.

1647
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,770
Let me find another convenience store.

1648
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,560
He has to succeed. It's 10:18pm.

1649
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,330
This is pretty close.

1650
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:21,300
- Can you slow down a bit?
 -  He's really good.

1651
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,880
- I can finish them.
 -  No, not yet.

1652
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,630
How many did he make?

1653
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,730
He made four so far.

1654
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,400
- That's amazing.
 -  You can't make them too fast.

1655
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,330
You can't be too fast or too slow.

1656
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,670
- We took so much time on the road.
 -  The GPS didn't work well.

1657
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,040
(There are 6 minutes and 25 seconds left.)

1658
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,530
- I'm sorry.
 -  You need to make them by 10:30pm.

1659
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,000
(There are 6 minutes and 25 seconds left.)

1660
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,230
(Gary finds another convenience store for the potato chips.)

1661
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:46,410
Hello, do you sell the potato chips I'm looking for? Do you?

1662
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,040
Where are they?

1663
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,340
- Where are they?
 -  They're here.

1664
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:54,440
This is it. This is the original flavour, right?

1665
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,130
I need to pay for it.

1666
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,880
- He made six cups already.
 -  Oh, my.

1667
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,900
It's this way.

1668
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,740
(He runs toward the coffee shop.)

1669
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:07,620
If we don't succeed, we have to receive the penalty.

1670
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,580
This is pretty close.

1671
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,610
Where did he go?

1672
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,600
We're in trouble.

1673
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,920
You would hate this.

1674
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,230
- It's the chocolate ice cream.
 -  This is crazy.

1675
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,430
(What is their fate?)

1676
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,820
Is he back yet?

1677
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:20,930
No, not yet.

1678
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,870
- He's here.
 -  He's here!

1679
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,730
(Gary is back.)

1680
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:28,200
- He's here.
 -  He's here!

1681
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,900
(Gary arrives before the seventh cup of coffee is made.)

1682
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,740
- Let's see.
 -  We just need the coffee.

1683
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:37,270
(Their completion time is the most important.)

1684
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,030
(If they go over the time, they will be penalised.)

1685
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,410
(Did Gary arrive on time?)

1686
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,510
Mission cleared!

1687
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,460
- Yes!
 -  We did it!

1688
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,140
They didn't sell those potato chips.

1689
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,430
The coffee is here.

1690
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,690
- The coffee is out.
 -  Just in time.

1691
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:58,940
- That's perfect.
 -  What time is it now?

1692
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,380
Here you go.

1693
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:07,070
In what ways did you help Gary, by the way?

1694
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,030
I just made music with him. I don't know if I helped.

1695
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,200
He made music with me. But to me,

1696
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,890
he did much more. He would take his music...

1697
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,930
- and let me rap in it.
 -  He let you feature in it?

1698
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,640
He got us involved.

1699
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,090
So I earned 300 dollars. It was a lot for me at the time.

1700
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,340
He provided me with work.

1701
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,910
- He was like a mother bird.
 -  He was.

1702
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,710
I heard the story about "Ballerino", and I was really surprised.

1703
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,570
This is how I came...

1704
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,200
- to compose "Ballerino".
 -  Really?

1705
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,330
Gun visited my studio one day.

1706
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:40,390
I asked him to show me something good...

1707
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,880
because he is so good at playing the piano.

1708
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,170
And immediately, he played this melody.

1709
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,590
(As soon as he was asked to play something,)

1710
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:49,400
(he composed an impromptu song, which has become "Ballerino".)

1711
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,580
And...

1712
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,880
he moved onto this part.

1713
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,360
So my friend recorded him playing the melody.

1714
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,300
While playing, I asked if it was okay.

1715
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,270
But he already turned his recorder on.

1716
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,330
- It was so good.
 -  Really?

1717
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,250
And he used that melody in his song.

1718
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,470
Wow.

1719
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,340
He even composed...

1720
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,380
the piano part in "I'm Not Laughing".

1721
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,310
I think most of the piano parts in Leessang's songs...

1722
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,600
were made by Yoon Gun.

1723
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,830
(He's a genius composer.)

1724
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:17,250
He can make good melodies in three tries.

1725
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,240
He's a genius composer.

1726
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,480
He is.

1727
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,110
(Gary and Yoon Gun have shared many ideas through music.)

1728
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,770
They inserted their photo into the necklace.

1729
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,160
This is for you.

1730
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,200
- I'll put this on your neck.
 -  Yes, please.

1731
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,700
Let's give it up for Gun.

1732
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,300
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1733
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,470
(The Last Love: Cleared)

1734
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,840
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1735
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,340
We all cleared our missions today.

1736
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,130
We'd like to say thank you to all the guests for being with us.

1737
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:49,540
- Thank you!
 -  Thank you!

1738
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,480
Thank you and we love you!

1739
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,100
I'm sorry, I love you!

1740
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,660
Thank you, everyone. We all succeeded today.

1741
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,040
- Thank you.
 -  Thanks, guys.

1742
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,100
- Thanks a lot.
 -  Thanks.

1743
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,240
You did a great job today.

1744
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,740
(Each love completed our seven loves.)

1745
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,710
(We root for your precious loves.)

1746
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,240
I came Fukuoka to meet him.

1747
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm so nervous.

1748
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,570
All right. Kyuhyun!

1749
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,330
(You can watch the special Apology Service for Kyuhyun...)

1750
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:18,310
(on our SBS website and various web portals.)

1751
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:25,910
Have you ever thought about what you'd be doing if not a soldier?

1752
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,680
What do you mean?

1753
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,630
(Running Man Special)

1754
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,610
("Descent of the Sun")

1755
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,520
(Jin Goo and Ji Won wear training suits rather than uniforms.)

1756
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,810
(Now they have name tags instead of ranking bars.)

1757
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,810
(A dangerous invitation for Jin Goo and Kim Ji Won.)

1758
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,710
(Next Sunday at 6:25pm)
