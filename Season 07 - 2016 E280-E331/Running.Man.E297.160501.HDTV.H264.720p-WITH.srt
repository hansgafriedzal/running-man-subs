1
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:10,807
(This Week's Special, Descendants of the Sun)

2
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:12,367
(They received orders to appear on Running Man.)

3
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,407
- Oh my goodness. - She's a good dancer.

4
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:16,407
(Kim Ji Won's charming dance)

5
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:17,537
Is it not me?

6
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:18,937
(Manly Jin Goo's unexpected charm is revealed.)

7
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:23,107
(The guests took off their badges and put on name tags instead.)

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:27,307
(It's a race that's more difficult and intense than that in Urk.)

9
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,377
(Descendants of the Sun versus Running Man)

10
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:29,507
Give me a second.

11
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:36,067
(Sergeant Major Seo and Lieutenant Yoon's heartfelt love story)

12
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:40,667
(Their unfinished story will be continued today on Running Man.)

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,707
(A Running Man Special, Descent of the Sun)

14
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:48,637
I heard Jin Goo is coming today. We are like brothers.

15
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,407
Stop acting friendly with him all of a sudden.

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,867
- Are you close to everyone? - Haha, please tell them.

17
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,207
They don't believe me.

18
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:57,407
Jae Seok and I helped him a lot when he was getting married.

19
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,967
- Really. - It's true.

20
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,367
- Jin Goo will agree, too. - Listen to him.

21
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:02,577
- We helped him. - All right. Let's ask him.

22
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:05,267
- Let's ask him when he shows up. - Go ahead. Ask him.

23
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:09,207
- I brought special friends today. - What are you doing?

24
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,407
(Why are you suddenly acting like the host?)

25
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,577
- Are you the host? - What are you holding in your hand?

26
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,637
- Stop it. - Why are you holding the cue cards?

27
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:18,337
- Hey, stop it. - You're not the host.

28
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:20,637
I wasn't confident.

29
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:21,967
How dare you take the cue cards?

30
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:24,967
You were waiting for a good time to begin, weren't you?

31
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,067
- What is this? - I thought it was great timing.

32
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:28,607
- Look at this. - Wasn't my timing nice?

33
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,107
Doesn't he look like a host at a meet and greet...

34
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,637
for "Descendants of the Sun"?

35
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,067
- Right. - He looks like the host.

36
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,807
(He's working two jobs.)

37
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:36,767
- Why am I the host? - The meet-and-greet host.

38
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,537
I am a cast member!

39
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:39,937
Oh, gosh.

40
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,707
When will you start? Just start.

41
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,967
"Korea is mad for this man."

42
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,467
"Hallyu"...

43
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,337
- Can't a voice-over artist do it? - He's so bad at it.

44
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,537
- What's wrong with him? - He's really bad.

45
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:55,067
"This captivating man enchanted not only Korea but also China."

46
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,507
- "He's the hero of Korean dramas." - You will lose your voice soon.

47
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:02,337
"I will regret all the times I ran away from you."

48
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,707
Acting really doesn't suit you.

49
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,537
- Acting is not your forte. - It's my favourite line.

50
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:08,237
Stop it now.

51
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:10,137
"This man came to steal women's hearts!"

52
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:14,067
- Jin Goo! - It's Jin Goo!

53
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:21,067
(He's the man who captured women's hearts.)

54
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,137
(Sergeant Major Seo comes to Running Man.)

55
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,307
- My goodness. - It's Jin Goo.

56
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,867
- Jin Goo. - Hey, Jin Goo!

57
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:34,137
(Korea is mad for Sergeant Major Seo.)

58
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:39,137
(Jin Goo acts as a masculine man who sincerely loves one woman.)

59
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,007
- Hey, Jin Goo. - Jin Goo!

60
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,067
Jin Goo!

61
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,767
Welcome, Jin Goo.

62
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:45,937
(His military outfit looks pitiful.)

63
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,667
- Jin Goo! - Move, Seok Jin!

64
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,207
- Jin Goo. - I am a big fan.

65
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,737
- Welcome. - I've been your fan.

66
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:52,907
It's nice to meet you.

67
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,467
- Look at him. - Gosh.

68
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,967
First of all... Stop it!

69
00:02:58,037 --> 00:02:59,707
- Let me take a picture. - Stop it!

70
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,767
Don't post it on your SNS.

71
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,007
- Goodness. - It's a secret photo.

72
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,307
Jin Goo is here.

73
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:09,437
Please say hello to our viewers first.

74
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,237
Dear viewers of Running Man, it's nice to meet you all.

75
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,067
I am a fan myself, and I finally got to visit Running Man. I'm Jin Goo.

76
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,207
Jin Goo!

77
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,437
He did this.

78
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:19,907
Oh, gosh.

79
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,137
Salute.

80
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,137
(They say the same word, but it feels completely different.)

81
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,337
This is how he does it.

82
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,767
- Just don't do it. - By the way,

83
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,967
I have a question for him. Did you hear him?

84
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:29,337
Did Jae Seok really help you get married?

85
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,367
- Of course. We got him married. - We were the deciding factors.

86
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,867
- Haha as well? - They played a significant role.

87
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,737
See, it's true. He said it.

88
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:38,037
And I have something to say here.

89
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:43,107
A long time after I got married, I went on "Happy Together"...

90
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,207
as a guest, and he gave me a wedding gift with money.

91
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,307
Is that right?

92
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,567
- So I did that. - Yes.

93
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,137
I'm glad. I was actually wondering...

94
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,737
if I paid the congratulatory money or not.

95
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,607
I'm really glad.

96
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,537
- I'm glad. - Jin Goo.

97
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:56,737
I will give it to you today.

98
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,337
Did you not give it to him yet?

99
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,567
- He's my brother. - All right.

100
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,307
Who is the next guest?

101
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:06,867
"An angel"... "With great beauty came to Running Man."

102
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:08,707
He's terrible.

103
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,207
- He didn't prepare well. - Wait.

104
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,637
- Can you be more prepared? - What's this?

105
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,707
He's the special host for this episode.

106
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,467
- What is he doing? - I even saw him reading the script.

107
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,407
And he still does it like that.

108
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,707
- Hurry up. - "Her charms will entrance you."

109
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:24,537
Kim Ji Won!

110
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:27,967
- It's my first time meeting her. - Me, too.

111
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:29,277
- Ji Won is beautiful. - I can't wait to see her.

112
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:35,537
(Finally, an angel has arrived on Running Man.)

113
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,537
(Kim Ji Won)

114
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:45,367
Did you ever think about what you want to do outside of the military?

115
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,507
Don't you take your outfit off unless I do it myself.

116
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:51,337
(The angel of Urk, Yoon Myeong Ju, comes to Running Man.)

117
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,107
(She is an angel.)

118
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,207
She's beautiful!

119
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:57,867
- She became more beautiful. - She's the best!

120
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:58,937
She got prettier!

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,707
She's so pretty!

122
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,467
(The beautiful angel is here.)

123
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,607
Ji Won, you became even more beautiful.

124
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,467
- She's unbelievable. - It's my first time seeing her.

125
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:09,637
Call her Ms Ji Won.

126
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:11,137
It's just Ji Won.

127
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,907
(It's a burdensome escort from Kwang Soo.)

128
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,137
You are so beautiful.

129
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:16,807
- Hello. - She's beautiful.

130
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:19,207
Ji Won is...

131
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
She's truly beautiful.

132
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,507
- What happened? - Wait. Let's rearrange ourselves.

133
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,067
- Can you go to the end, Seok Jin? - No!

134
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:26,007
- Why would I do that? - It just looks...

135
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,937
- They are beautiful, and... - You can just cut me out.

136
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,307
- But really... - It just looks bad.

137
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,407
- You ruin the picture. - And why did you wear that jacket?

138
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,737
Gary, can you come here?

139
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,407
- Stay with Ji Hyo. - I am too embarrassed.

140
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,067
- Why? - Gary, take off your hat.

141
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,267
No!

142
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:40,637
(His bare head is revealed.)

143
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:42,737
(Everyone is in shock.)

144
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,307
- What's wrong with Gary? - What happened to him?

145
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,407
- Gosh... - He shaved his head.

146
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,137
I don't know why I shaved my head today.

147
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,537
(It suddenly looks like the movie "Silmido".)

148
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:49,667
I apologise.

149
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,237
Ji Won, please say hi to our viewers.

150
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,707
Hello, I am Kim Ji Won who played Yoon Myeong Ju.

151
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,137
I am so thankful.

152
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,437
(Angel Lieutenant Yoon reports her attendance.)

153
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,007
- I am so thankful. - She's more beautiful in person.

154
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,537
- She's very pretty. - How is she...

155
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,767
How is...

156
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:06,467
Her eyes are...

157
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,407
- Her eyes are huge. - She's beautiful.

158
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,837
- She's like a cartoon. - She's so beautiful.

159
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,407
- There's one more guest. - Is there someone else?

160
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,267
"She's 2016's hottest rising star."

161
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,807
- Who is it? - It's Eunseo from Cosmic Girls!

162
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:17,937
- Eunseo? - It's Eunseo.

163
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,107
(It's Eunseo from Cosmic Girls!)

164
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:24,267
(A mysterious girl has come to Running Man.)

165
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:27,407
(Cosmic Girls came to Running Man!)

166
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,837
- Eunseo! - She's from Kwang Soo's agency.

167
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,037
Oh, gosh!

168
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,507
- Cosmic Girls! - Yes!

169
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,837
It's Eunseo.

170
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,137
(Eunseo from Cosmic Girls)

171
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,137
(Cosmic Girl Eunseo is on Running Man.)

172
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,607
- Come here, Eunseo. - Oh, goodness.

173
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,037
- She's so young. - Wait.

174
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,107
Wait a minute.

175
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,707
I am very glad that Eunseo is here.

176
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,637
But how is she related to Jin Goo and Ji Won?

177
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,307
- Is there a connection? - How are you related?

178
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,107
I represent...

179
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,867
(I am a representative...)

180
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:56,137
(Was she on "Descendants of the Sun?")

181
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,937
(Or is she a soldier's daughter like Lieutenant Yoon is?)

182
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,367
I represent the viewers of "Descendants of the Sun".

183
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,667
- I see. - I see.

184
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,707
She must've prepared to answer this question.

185
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,567
- What? - She knew we'd ask her this.

186
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:08,307
Hold on.

187
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,767
Did you help her get on the show because she's from the same agency?

188
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,137
- Did you talk her into this? - No. No.

189
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,667
- He's the lead actor. - We are all colleagues.

190
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,267
- How so? - We shot a music video together.

191
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,907
And they were in "Descendants of the Sun" together.

192
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:21,607
- With Jin Goo... - You...

193
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:24,137
- Kwang Soo is the best. - Now you can help someone.

194
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,467
You're in the position to help someone else now.

195
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,737
- He's a big shot now. - It's not like that.

196
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,767
I'll say this though. Focus on helping yourself.

197
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,267
(Jae Seok gives a cutting remark.)

198
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,267
- I will stick around until the end. - Take care of yourself first.

199
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:35,637
- Why humiliate me in front of her? - I am sorry.

200
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,237
- He says he's sorry. - Eunseo...

201
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,967
- Eunseo joined us on Running Man. - She's lovely.

202
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,707
- We have three precious guests. - Yes.

203
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,867
- They are my best mates. - We already introduced them,

204
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,037
but we will introduce each of them in detail.

205
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,037
I normally don't interview guests.

206
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,037
- But today is special. - It's special.

207
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,067
- First, Jin Goo. - Yes.

208
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,607
You became much more popular. Can you feel your popularity?

209
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,337
How is it? Please tell us honestly.

210
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,967
I started using SNS.

211
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:00,207
(He began using SNS.)

212
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,537
But you usually don't do that.

213
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,037
- You must have a lot of followers. - I'm just not good at it.

214
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,337
Jin Goo is on SNS?

215
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,037
- It doesn't suit him! - I know.

216
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,407
I started it,

217
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,237
and the reaction was intense.

218
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,837
How many followers do you have?

219
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,807
I think as of today, I have around one million followers.

220
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,237
- Wow! - Wow!

221
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,137
It took Seok Jin three years to get that many!

222
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,067
It took him three years!

223
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,767
It took him 50 years.

224
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:25,007
After the drama ended, how have you been doing?

225
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,407
After the drama ended,

226
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,967
I watched all the airing episodes,

227
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,767
and now I am watching replays at home.

228
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,737
- You're immersed in it. - You're immersed in the drama.

229
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,037
- She's immersed in it. - You haven't gotten out of it yet.

230
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,407
She doesn't want to get out of it.

231
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,437
- I'm watching it all the time. - She hasn't gotten out of it yet.

232
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,767
How is it, Ji Won? Actually,

233
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:43,467
she rose to stardom through TV commercials.

234
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,807
She shot many TV commercials.

235
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:47,377
- She shot a lot of them. - "I picked a star in the sky."

236
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:50,107
The best one is not the recent ones. That star one was the best.

237
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,467
Can you show us how you did it?

238
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:52,637
(The drink commercial that made Ji Won famous)

239
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:55,467
I picked a star from the sky

240
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,407
I picked the moon from the sky

241
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,767
I will put them in your hands

242
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,467
It's been such a long time so I don't remember it well.

243
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,837
But you were so lovely in that commercial.

244
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,807
(They force her to start by clapping their hands.)

245
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,467
I picked a star from the sky

246
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,507
- Her voice is amazing. - I picked the moon from the sky

247
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,837
I will put them in your hands

248
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,877
- Bravo! - Wonderful!

249
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:20,707
(Jae Seok is captivated.)

250
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,237
(Her angelic voice captures the men's hearts.)

251
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,307
Oh my goodness!

252
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:25,467
Her voice is angelic.

253
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,377
- The next part is "Beautiful days". - Beautiful days

254
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,637
I didn't know about this.

255
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:33,237
There's my childhood friend, Seung Joon.

256
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,937
There's my buddy, Joong Ki...

257
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,567
- and my buddy Jin Goo. - Why are they your buddies?

258
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,607
- I'm here, too. Aren't I? - I know.

259
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:39,807
You're here.

260
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,137
Don't keep talking as if you were one of the cast on the show.

261
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,407
I'm sure you were jealous.

262
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,937
You are the president of Joong Ki's fan club.

263
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:47,877
What are you talking about?

264
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,137
- How can you say that? - He's...

265
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,607
busy being a celebrity and a fan club president.

266
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,037
I am not the president.

267
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,137
- And you work as an event host. - That's right.

268
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:57,307
- He... - Why am I the event host?

269
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,437
I heard he went to the after party for your drama.

270
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:02,137
It wasn't the after party. It was a cast party.

271
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,967
- At the time... - Wasn't it strange to have him?

272
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,837
- Was he there? - He asked, "Was he there?"

273
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,667
He must've been drunk.

274
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,107
- He's pretty invisible. - I was there!

275
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,537
- He's tall, yet... - Were you there?

276
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:13,407
- He's tall, yet he's invisible. - That's hilarious.

277
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,537
They had no idea you were there.

278
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:16,967
- I was... - Do you not remember him?

279
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,267
- Where did you go? - Ji Won?

280
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:20,737
- I don't remember him being there. - Really?

281
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:22,507
(Their memory of Kwang Soo has been deleted.)

282
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,067
- Don't do that. - What happened?

283
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,237
I was there with the chairman of the production company.

284
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:27,667
- That's scary. - I see.

285
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:29,907
I've never been so surprised since "Whispering Corridors".

286
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,437
- I remember it. - He was there.

287
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,137
What's with this reaction?

288
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,237
- Why were you there anyways? - So...

289
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:36,707
- don't go there. - It wasn't your place to be.

290
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,407
All the bosses were there at the time,

291
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,137
- so we were too nervous. - That's why they needed him.

292
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,967
- They needed him for comic relief. - But even so...

293
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,607
- Even if you were nervous... - They needed him.

294
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,207
You are being too harsh.

295
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,377
- Why would you say that? - Since it's a difficult situation,

296
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,007
they needed him to make them laugh.

297
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,137
- Like a clown? - That's harsh.

298
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:52,507
Don't you think that's too harsh?

299
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,267
- You were a laughing stock. - Why call him a laughing stock?

300
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,767
- That's so funny. - Seok Jin, you are too mean.

301
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,267
Let's talk about Eunseo now.

302
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,437
- She's a member of Cosmic Girls. - I know them.

303
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,467
- I know them. - They're a girl group.

304
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,707
Please sing...

305
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,007
- us a song of Cosmic Girls. - Show us.

306
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,537
- I will sing a part of it. - Do we have music?

307
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:13,967
("Mo Mo Mo" by Cosmic Girls)

308
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:16,137
- This is not my part. - It's "Mo Mo Mo".

309
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,507
(It's not her part, but she dances perfectly.)

310
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,737
This is my part!

311
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,367
She doesn't just swing her arm.

312
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,767
- She's so cute. - It goes like this.

313
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,737
(I am a Cosmic Girl.)

314
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,367
- She's so lively. - Seriously.

315
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,007
Jin Goo danced to Red Velvet's "Dumb Dumb" on the drama.

316
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,137
- Right! - Yes!

317
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,607
- That's right! - I remember.

318
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:42,067
(Sergeant Major Seo's version of "Dumb Dumb".)

319
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,737
Jin Goo, you should show us.

320
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,567
- Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb - Do you have the song?

321
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,707
That's right. You danced to their performance.

322
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,007
- That's good. - Go, Jin Goo!

323
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,237
- Jin Goo, let's go! - Jin Goo!

324
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:55,737
Jin Goo, let's go!

325
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:56,907
(I'll show you if you really want to see it.)

326
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,807
(Here comes the dancing machine.)

327
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,337
(He looks disciplined.)

328
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,507
You've changed a lot, Jin Goo.

329
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:11,007
(His hips have edge.)

330
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:14,707
(He's a "Descendent of the Dance".)

331
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,237
- Good job. - That was good.

332
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:18,637
- Hey, Ji Won. - That was cute.

333
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,667
Ji Won. While we're at it,

334
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,907
- could you dance for us? - She knows how to dance.

335
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,407
- Is that right? - She dances well.

336
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,737
Please give her the music.

337
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,507
- How do I do this? - Go ahead, Ji Won.

338
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,137
You can do it.

339
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,107
This is "Bombastic".

340
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,237
- Let's go! - Kim Ji Won! Kim Ji Won!

341
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:44,507
- Kim Ji Won! Kim Ji Won! - Watch her.

342
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,767
- Wow. - What's that?

343
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,837
Ji Won, what's that?

344
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:50,867
Kim Ji Won! Kim Ji Won!

345
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,067
(She does a triple combination of hearts.)

346
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,267
What's that?

347
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,707
(She finishes with an arrow of love.)

348
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:59,737
(Ji Won's heart dance will be the hit of the year.)

349
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:01,967
(Ji Won has captured their hearts.)

350
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:04,407
- She's so cute. - She looks pretty when she does it.

351
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,737
- She's so cute. - That's how it's supposed to be.

352
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,967
- It's pretty when a woman does it. - She's so pretty.

353
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,237
(All hail Ji Won.)

354
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,867
- She's so pretty. - This is it.

355
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,507
That's great.

356
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,337
- Can you do it? - What?

357
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:16,937
- Of course. - Can you do this?

358
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,207
- Really? - Of course.

359
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,437
Isn't this simple? Shall we try it together?

360
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:21,567
Cue the music.

361
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,437
First up is Haha.

362
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,437
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

363
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:32,637
(He puts on a neat heart performance as a dancer.)

364
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,137
- Good job. - Ji Hyo!

365
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,667
- Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo! - That's good.

366
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,337
(She's cheerful and bubbly.)

367
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:39,967
(She's pretty.)

368
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:41,807
Let's go.

369
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,267
(Here comes Seok Jin.)

370
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:44,467
(He's slower than the music.)

371
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,767
Seok Jin, please dance to the music.

372
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,667
- What are you doing? - What is that?

373
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,567
- What was that? - Go, Gary!

374
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:54,007
Come on! Show your style.

375
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,567
That's right. Good job.

376
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,137
(He makes a dynamic turn.)

377
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,907
Next is Kwang Soo.

378
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:04,707
(His movements are stiff.)

379
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,767
(What's that?)

380
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,007
Okay.

381
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:12,707
- Let's go, Jong Kook. - I don't like doing this.

382
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,207
You still need to do it. Copy Ji Won.

383
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:17,337
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook! - He's embarrassed.

384
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:20,007
- Kim Jong Kook! - You're not doing it properly.

385
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,567
- I told you to do it properly. - I don't like doing this.

386
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:24,007
Let's go Eunseo.

387
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,407
- Jin Goo is last. - Eunseo! Eunseo!

388
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,667
- Eunseo! - Let's go!

389
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,107
Good job!

390
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,137
Jin Goo is next. Jin Goo!

391
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,007
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

392
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,537
(This is a real man's heart dance.)

393
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,137
He's cool.

394
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:39,907
That was good.

395
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,437
(This is how a man dances.)

396
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,407
You looked like a soldier, Sergeant Major Seo.

397
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,907
Ji Won, show us one more time.

398
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,207
(Let's see how the original looks like.)

399
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,367
She's so pretty.

400
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:52,767
- She's so lively. - That's pretty.

401
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:55,607
- Good job! - Gary, you should go.

402
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:56,907
Show them.

403
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:58,837
(He's exposed.)

404
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,467
(He resembles a North Korean soldier.)

405
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,537
- Look at him. - Look at his head.

406
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,637
- You shaved your hair well. - Hey.

407
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,667
Did Gary always look like a criminal?

408
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:12,437
- I shouldn't have shaved my head. - Your clothes match, too.

409
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:14,337
- He looks like a prisoner. - He does.

410
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,307
He's like "Papillon".

411
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,867
Today, we have Jin Goo, Ji Won...

412
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,207
and Eunseo from Cosmic Girls with us.

413
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,137
Isn't it great to have them on Running Man?

414
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:27,207
- I look forward to today. - It's spring.

415
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,737
This surely is a spring special.

416
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,467
What shall we do today?

417
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:33,837
Once I call your name, please step forward.

418
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:36,337
- Seok Jin, Ji Hyo and Gary. - Okay.

419
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:38,237
This team is the funny one.

420
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:41,137
We can't be the funny team without Kwang Soo.

421
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,737
Okay. What? "Loser"?

422
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:50,067
(What is this Loser's Sticker?)

423
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,667
- What's that? - Is this why we ran in the morning?

424
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,407
- There was something to it. - Was it a win or lose?

425
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,667
(This morning at 10am, Incheon Songdo Hotel)

426
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:09,067
(Jae Seok arrives on set as usual.)

427
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:12,907
Oh, dear. Hello, Hwan Jin.

428
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:16,437
- It's a special episode. - What's with that face?

429
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,967
(He runs away.)

430
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,707
(You must catch the producer and write the answer on his arm.)

431
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,367
(Solve the problem below and write the answer on the producer's arm.)

432
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,767
(The race began immediately.)

433
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,967
(Why are you doing this from the early morning?)

434
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,507
(He caught him.)

435
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,237
(Jae Seok completed the mission.)

436
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,407
(Today's race began like this.)

437
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,907
"Solve the problem..." What is this?

438
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,207
(What exactly was this mission about?)

439
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,037
(Just run.)

440
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,967
Come on!

441
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,237
He's too fast.

442
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:51,567
(They had to run as soon as they arrived on set.)

443
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,267
(Scurrying)

444
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,637
(Everybody completed the mission within various times.)

445
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,567
(What was Jong Kook's strategy?)

446
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,407
(He took the opposite route.)

447
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,507
What?

448
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:04,707
(He found a weak spot and went for the producer.)

449
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,337
Ta-da!

450
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,437
(They all succeeded.)

451
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:12,907
You're too fast.

452
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,937
Was I?

453
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,737
So are we the funny team?

454
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,537
- Are we the funny ones? - We must have lost.

455
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,937
You have received Loser's Stickers.

456
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,007
- Really? - Why?

457
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,607
Watch this clip to gain a better understanding of it.

458
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,507
- There must be something behind it. - Why did we lose?

459
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:38,137
(This person looks familiar.)

460
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,737
(It's Argus!)

461
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,437
Hey, guys.

462
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,967
- Isn't that Gary? - Isn't he from the drama?

463
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:47,337
It's Argus!

464
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:48,737
(What is David McInnics doing here?)

465
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:50,667
- It's the bad guy! - He's so cool.

466
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,137
- He's handsome. - "It's the bad guy"?

467
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,607
Hey, guys.

468
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,907
Are you surprised to see the Loser's Sticker on your chest?

469
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,937
In six hours, you shall meet me...

470
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:05,137
and receive a deadly punishment.

471
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,807
- A deadly punishment? - Oh my goodness.

472
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,767
He's scary.

473
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,467
But don't worry.

474
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:17,737
If you do better than the Red Sun hiding amongst yourselves,

475
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:20,707
you'll be able to return home safely.

476
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,337
The Red Sun is amongst us?

477
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,907
Is somebody hiding among us?

478
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:29,307
The mysterious Loser's Sticker on your chest...

479
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,537
means that you were slower than the Red Sun in completing the mission.

480
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,437
During the six hour race, if you lose...

481
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:37,907
or get a lower record than the Red Sun,

482
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,807
you will receive a Loser's Sticker.

483
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,737
If you want to survive,

484
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,667
find the Red Sun as soon as possible...

485
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,907
and stop his victory.

486
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:52,737
And of course, if the Red Sun ends up with the lowest record...

487
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:57,537
he or she will be facing a deadly punishment.

488
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,107
You may be wondering what that punishment is.

489
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,407
So I'm going to do you a favour and give you a little sneak peak.

490
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:09,367
(The cries are frightening.)

491
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,937
- "My mum just came along..." - This is not for everybody.

492
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,537
(It's not recommended by experienced users.)

493
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,467
- Is this for real? - I can't do this.

494
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:18,137
(You'll realise why this is the most extreme ride.)

495
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,207
(This will become their reality if they don't defeat the Red Sun.)

496
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,267
- I'm stressed out. - This is so stressful.

497
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:30,577
Let me help you by telling you what the Red Sun's mission is.

498
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:35,577
The Red Sun will receive a Loser's Sticker on his chest...

499
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:39,707
each time he or she doesn't complete the mission in the top three.

500
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:44,867
Let's hope I don't see you in six hours.

501
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,577
- How cool. - Wow.

502
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:53,237
- Argus! - So the Red Sun is in the group.

503
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,607
- That's right. - Isn't it you, Jae Seok?

504
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,607
- You're clever and funny. - So he was faster than these three.

505
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,107
Simply put, he or she was faster than these three.

506
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,367
- Really? - So it's not them.

507
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,607
- So we lost to the Red Sun? - Yes.

508
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,207
- Is that right? - So that means it's not them.

509
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,267
So the Red Sun is amongst us.

510
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:14,207
Today's shoot will go on for a total of six hours.

511
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,267
There's a set time.

512
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,237
That's why we named this race Descent of the Sun.

513
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,237
Is it because we won't be filming after the sun descends?

514
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,337
You tried so hard.

515
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,637
No wonder you dressed me like this.

516
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:28,107
- No wonder. - I want to take this off.

517
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,407
You have only six hours. Please get ready...

518
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,707
and move to the next location.

519
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,937
- Yes, let's go! - All right!

520
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,437
(Who will be the last one to smile?)

521
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,007
I'm so embarrassed.

522
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,207
- The atmosphere is so nice today. - It is.

523
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:42,807
- It's so nice. - We're wearing spring colours.

524
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,077
I really hope days like this continue.

525
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,007
(Chuckling)

526
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,337
Stop it.

527
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,737
What did you say?

528
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,737
It's too bad we are only shooting for six hours.

529
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:54,767
Can't we just do 60 hours instead?

530
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,107
I took a selfie with Ji Won.

531
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,637
(They're Jin Goo and Ji Won's fans.)

532
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,467
- That's not wise. - How annoying.

533
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:03,637
- Ji Won is really nice. - She is really nice.

534
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,467
- She's innocent. - Jin Goo is very nice, too.

535
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,237
Jin Goo really is.

536
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,367
- Eunseo must be nice, too. - We have to see about that.

537
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,007
- Isn't it your first time on TV? - It is...

538
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:13,737
my first time being on a show by myself.

539
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,537
- Right. - Tell them it's your first time.

540
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,937
Actually, it's my first time.

541
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,577
- What are you asking her to do? - Are you the CEO?

542
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:22,407
- Are you the CEO? - No, we belong to the same agency.

543
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,807
So the first game is a couple's game.

544
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,767
- It's a couple's game. - Is it?

545
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,207
We don't have many options.

546
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,077
The competition is fierce.

547
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:34,637
- Gosh, this is sensational. - Right.

548
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,867
- It is intense indeed. - Gosh.

549
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,467
Before we start the game, we'll have a play-off...

550
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,137
- to decide partners. - Okay.

551
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:45,137
I found out that everything I like starts with "S".

552
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:48,037
Samgyetang, samgyeopsal,

553
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,937
ssomaek and Seo Dae Yeong.

554
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:53,037
(The men must name 5 words with the same letter in 5 seconds.)

555
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,207
Isn't it surprising?

556
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:56,237
Let's begin now.

557
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:59,607
- We'll play "Five Words Race." - Okay.

558
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,937
The woman who will go first is...

559
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,437
- Kim Ji Won. - Yes!

560
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,267
(Yes!)

561
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:10,367
- Great! - Awesome!

562
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:11,937
(This is the moment we've been dreaming of.)

563
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:14,937
- Where are you going? - Hello.

564
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,407
- Sit down, please. - Sit down.

565
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,507
Do you all want to be her partner?

566
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:23,537
- Why did you make her first? - Must we play the final round now?

567
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,007
- This isn't right. - It's nothing but the final round.

568
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,107
As we have you here as a guest,

569
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:31,737
Please appeal your bombastic charms to us.

570
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:33,837
Show us your bombastic charms.

571
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:35,007
- Bombastic - Right.

572
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,507
Come on.

573
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:39,267
(Please show us your charms.)

574
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:42,407
- Make some hearts. - In 1, 2, 3, 4!

575
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:44,037
(Cute)

576
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,007
(She makes them want to copy her.)

577
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,837
(Bang!)

578
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,107
(Lieutenant Yoon sends them her heart.)

579
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,567
- She sent it to me. - No way, it's me!

580
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:01,437
- It's me! - No, she was looking at me.

581
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,807
Do you have someone that you wish to be partners with?

582
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,937
Do you have someone that you wish to be partners with?

583
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:13,207
(Is there anyone here that you want to be partners with?)

584
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,507
Yes, I do.

585
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:23,107
(She has someone in mind.)

586
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,767
That should be me!

587
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:28,707
- We'll begin now. - Okay.

588
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,937
You have 5 seconds, and you should name 5 words.

589
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,107
- I think... - Get ready.

590
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,907
there will be a lot of dirty plays this round.

591
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,507
It's good that I didn't sit there.

592
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,467
- I don't think Jae Seok can win. - You can't beat us.

593
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:42,007
Jae Seok won't be able to move.

594
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,467
(Jae Seok is between two difficult players.)

595
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,667
- I like words that start with "S". - Okay.

596
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:49,937
(Ji Won chose "S".)

597
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:51,337
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo grab Jae Seok.)

598
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,107
Grab him! Don't let him move!

599
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,137
(Sorry. I think we're going to be late.)

600
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,107
- They're done. - They are.

601
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:02,137
(Haha manages to come in first.)

602
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,437
I'll begin the timer.

603
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:04,667
- I'll begin. - Okay.

604
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:08,107
- Apple, I love you... - In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

605
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,107
(Did he come to play or confess his love?)

606
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,207
- Get out of my way! - You're out.

607
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,667
- This is just a game. - Oh, gosh.

608
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:18,137
- My goodness. - I said, "I love you".

609
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:21,407
- In 1, 2, 3... - Human, love, desert...

610
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:23,107
- Why does she count so slowly? - four...

611
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,637
- She's counting slowly. - five.

612
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:27,137
- Sorry. - What is that?

613
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,807
- Accident, president, apple... - In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

614
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,567
(Jong Kook says one word...)

615
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,767
(and Ji Won begins to speed up her counting.)

616
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,037
You failed. Jong Kook failed!

617
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,637
Jong Kook!

618
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,607
(Everyone! Ji Won doesn't want Jong Kook to be her partner.)

619
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:41,907
That's great!

620
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,207
- Jong Kook failed! - Jong Kook!

621
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:45,767
(It's Seok Jin's turn.)

622
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:48,207
That was great!

623
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,737
Jong Kook...

624
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,567
- Love, Madam... - In 1, 5.

625
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,037
(That was a time warp.)

626
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:57,567
- He looks stupid. - Does 5 come right after 1?

627
00:24:57,737 --> 00:25:00,207
- Hey. - What was that?

628
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,307
She said 1 and 5. What is that?

629
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,907
This is impossible.

630
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:08,107
- Gary... - I didn't ring the bell yet.

631
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:09,807
- Boatman, love, situation... - In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

632
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:12,507
(It's clear that she doesn't want Gary either.)

633
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,137
- Crawl back. - Go back to the end.

634
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:15,667
- Go back. - Ji Won!

635
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:17,867
Ji Won is full of surprises.

636
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:20,107
Let's give it a shot.

637
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,137
Let's go.

638
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,537
- Salt, syrup... Is it not me? - In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

639
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,967
(Is it not me?)

640
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:28,007
(It's not you.)

641
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:31,267
- It's not? I thought you wanted me. - It's not you.

642
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,567
It's not me, is it? She didn't even count one for me.

643
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:35,937
- This is driving me crazy. - She counted so fast.

644
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,767
- Don't flatter yourself. - It was me all along.

645
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,807
- Goodness. - Count really fast, okay?

646
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,507
Gosh.

647
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,707
(Is Jae Seok the one that she wants?)

648
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,607
- I'll go now. - Okay.

649
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:46,237
I hope she counts really quickly.

650
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:48,567
- One... - Lo...

651
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,437
(Laughing)

652
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:54,237
- Why are you not counting? - Count!

653
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:57,307
- I can't because it's so funny. - What are you talking about?

654
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,607
It's not funny!

655
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:00,837
- It's not funny at all. - Deer, lion...

656
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,707
- Two... - I love you.

657
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:05,607
You can't say, "I love you".

658
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,107
(Jae Seok is subdued.)

659
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:08,907
Keep counting!

660
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,207
(Jae Seok's time is up.)

661
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,107
- Gosh, who is it? - Oh, my.

662
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:15,137
- It's me! - You want Jae Seok.

663
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:17,607
- Ji Won, wait for me. - It's Jae Seok.

664
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,007
She wants me!

665
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:21,737
- Why is it him over me? - It's Jae Seok.

666
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,567
- What's wrong with you? - What are you doing?

667
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,567
- What was that? - It's Jae Seok.

668
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:28,337
- It's me. - We all gave it a shot.

669
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:31,837
- I like words that start with "Ch". - "Ch"?

670
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,107
- Congratulate. - What starts with "Ch"?

671
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,107
There is no point going to her.

672
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,407
Wait. What are they doing?

673
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:40,137
Did you see that?

674
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,637
(Screaming)

675
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:46,837
(In the jungle, giraffes hunt those separated from their group.)

676
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,307
- You chose "Ch", right? - Yes.

677
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,407
- In 1, 5! - Dentist, okay.

678
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,007
- I'm sorry. - It's...

679
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:59,267
- It ended so quickly. - I'm sorry.

680
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:01,037
This is a good exercise.

681
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:02,967
(Jong Kook bravely gives it another shot.)

682
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,837
Look at Ji Won.

683
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:07,207
It's clear that she doesn't want you. She's not even looking at you.

684
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,607
- No. - Ji Won isn't looking at you.

685
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,207
- In 1, 5! - Congrat...

686
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,937
(Is that a newly coined word?)

687
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:16,567
- Pikachu! - Good.

688
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,667
- He said, "Pikachu". - Gosh.

689
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:20,037
- You're pretty obsessive. - This is nonsense!

690
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,237
He's pathetic.

691
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,207
- You're an obsessive guy. - She...

692
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,967
didn't even count from one when it was my turn.

693
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,607
Jong Kook is obsessive.

694
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,707
- We all failed. - Spit,

695
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,307
- You're right. - dance, gun.

696
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,567
- I'll start. - Okay.

697
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:33,807
You can only say words with one syllable.

698
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,807
(He's determined.)

699
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,137
One...

700
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,337
(Kwang Soo hits Ji Won's neck.)

701
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,937
(Kwang Soo tried to stop the timer.)

702
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,007
Hey! What are you doing?

703
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:46,467
- Gosh! - Dentist, seven...

704
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,637
Hey, why did you hit her?

705
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,467
- Why? - What are you doing?

706
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,207
Are you okay?

707
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,267
How could you hit Ji Won's neck?

708
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:56,567
- Hey! Ji Won... - Gosh.

709
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:59,667
- Are you okay? - You're not sane, are you?

710
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,737
- My goodness. - You can't do that to her.

711
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,467
How could you hit her?

712
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,407
- I am sorry. Are you okay? - Gosh.

713
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,567
She kept counting even though I hit her neck.

714
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,707
- My goodness. - Are you okay? I'm sorry.

715
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,037
- It's okay. This is so funny. - Are you okay?

716
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:14,537
She's crying.

717
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:16,337
- Are you okay, Ji Won? - She is startled.

718
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:17,567
Ji Won, I am sorry.

719
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,737
- Kwang Soo. - You made her cry.

720
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,307
- That was really mean. - Kwang Soo!

721
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,607
(Who made Ji Won cry?)

722
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,767
Ji Won.

723
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,307
Are you out of your mind?

724
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:29,967
We finally got her to come on our show. How could you do that to her?

725
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:32,037
I never thought he'd hit me.

726
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:33,607
I think she wants Jae Seok.

727
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:35,667
Okay. Dental floss,

728
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:37,337
- She already made up her mind. - toothpaste,

729
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,137
- toothbrush and... - He is so arrogant. It's annoying.

730
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:42,567
- You're so annoying. - Why?

731
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,607
- What do you mean? - Four.

732
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:47,037
Periodontitis...

733
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:48,707
and gingivitis.

734
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:50,567
(Great!)

735
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:52,837
My goodness.

736
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:56,507
(Jae Seok and Ji Won are the first couple.)

737
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,507
I like Ji Hyo. You look pretty today.

738
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:02,107
- Let's start! - Ji Hyo is so pretty!

739
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:03,807
- All right. - Ji Hyo has very bright skin.

740
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,737
There aren't many female members left.

741
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:08,467
You all know Ji Hyo well, right?

742
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,407
- She is very precise. - Right.

743
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:11,967
- Okay. - Good.

744
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:15,437
I like someone whose name starts with "J".

745
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,307
(Did you say name? Not word?)

746
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,867
(Was it a mistake? Or did she really mean it?)

747
00:29:23,937 --> 00:29:25,637
(My name also starts with "J".)

748
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,037
I like someone whose name starts with "J".

749
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:29,307
Did you say "J"?

750
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,667
Ji Hyo...

751
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,667
(Smiling)

752
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:39,237
(A man starts moving immediately towards her.)

753
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,707
Jin Goo is the only one who's going.

754
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:45,937
(Although everyone was ready to start,)

755
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,737
(they gave up immediately after Jin Goo began to move.)

756
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:50,337
Jin Goo is the only one who's moving.

757
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,907
(They lost their will to fight.)

758
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,367
(Here comes Prince Charming.)

759
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:59,067
Jin Goo, Ji Hyo, Jee Seok Jin,

760
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,937
- One. - Earth and truth.

761
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,767
Correct!

762
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,307
I knew she'd do that.

763
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:06,937
Thank you.

764
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:10,907
(Jin Goo and Ji Hyo are the second couple.)

765
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:13,707
- This is ridiculous. - Now...

766
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:15,267
- Eunseo! - It's Eunseo!

767
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,337
- It's Eunseo's turn. - Eunseo!

768
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:18,837
I am Eunseo.

769
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,107
- I'll be right there, Eunseo. - Eunseo...

770
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:24,907
Please, Eunseo. Eunseo!

771
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:28,137
- I like words that start with "O". - Okay.

772
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:29,637
- It's "O"! - Hold on.

773
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,207
Gosh, look at him!

774
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,437
(Haha tries to be fast.)

775
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,137
What is that? Wait.

776
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,737
(See you later.)

777
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:42,207
It's "O".

778
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,737
(Haha doesn't give up.)

779
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,267
(I'll escort you to the side.)

780
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:48,667
I'm waiting for "O".

781
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,007
Let me think.

782
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,337
Let me go. It's me. You want me to come, right?

783
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:59,137
- Eunseo, it's me, right? - I'm looking at only one person.

784
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,237
Dad, mum, aunt, uncle and Lee Kwang Soo.

785
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:03,837
- In 1, 2, 5. - Dad, mum, aunt, uncle...

786
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:06,137
- and Cosmic Girls. I'm done. - In 1, 2, 5.

787
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,437
She said 1, 2 and 5.

788
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,007
Did you say 1, 2, 5? How dare you!

789
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,207
- Haha, you're pitiful. - Accept your defeat.

790
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,237
- Get up. - Dad, mum, Lee Kwang Soo...

791
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:18,407
Dad, mum, aunt, uncle and Lee Kwang Soo.

792
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,307
There's no point in practising. Just do it.

793
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,367
- Five. - Dad, aunt...

794
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,237
(A quick goodbye)

795
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,107
She skipped to five.

796
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:30,637
- Go to the end of the line. - Don't you know how to count?

797
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:32,007
Don't you know how to count to five?

798
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:35,067
I can do it.

799
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:36,837
I think Kwang Soo will succeed this time.

800
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,237
- Dad, brother, mother, milk... - One.

801
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:40,967
- and Cosmic Girls. - Two.

802
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,567
(He succeeds.)

803
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,067
(They're disappointed.)

804
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,307
Well done.

805
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,667
(Kwang Soo and Eunseo are the third couple.)

806
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,907
- There are only guys left. - I thought it would be Kwang Soo.

807
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:56,037
(There are 2 male couples and 3 co-ed couples.)

808
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,867
- What is this? - There's something there.

809
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,207
- What is this? - I see trays.

810
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:00,707
It looks blocked.

811
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,007
- Trays? - What are they for?

812
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:03,137
It seems like "Tray Noraebang".

813
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:05,007
(There are cushions and trays.)

814
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,207
What are we doing here?

815
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,637
(The first game is "Tray Quiz.")

816
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:10,137
- Do we just stand here? - It must be like "Tray Noraebang".

817
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:15,107
(It's their first chance to figure out who the Red Sun is.)

818
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:19,037
(The Red Sun must be revealed in order to avoid penalty.)

819
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,537
- Two hours have passed already. - There are 2, 4 and 5.

820
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,267
- The time flies. - I agree.

821
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,137
I guess women will sit over there.

822
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,367
- Of course they will. - Right?

823
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,067
- So only men will be penalised. - We'll get hit.

824
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:30,407
- It makes sense. - Of course.

825
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,367
The game is "Tray Quiz."

826
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,807
Female members will sit in the front and answer quizzes.

827
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,707
Male members will sit under the tray...

828
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:40,037
and will be hit if the answer is wrong.

829
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:41,237
- I see. - That's why there are trays.

830
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,367
If the female member thinks that she knows the answer,

831
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:46,867
she must sound the proper buzzer to have a chance to answer.

832
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,107
For the first quiz,

833
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:51,237
the women must sing and dance...

834
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:53,407
- to answer the quiz. - Nice. Eunseo has an advantage.

835
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,567
- We're at an advantage! - Really?

836
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:56,937
Are they going out front to dance?

837
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,567
The first question is...

838
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:00,367
about a romance movie...

839
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:04,537
- called "Music and Lyrics." - I know this movie.

840
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:06,867
In the movie, Hugh Grant says to Drew Barrymore that...

841
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:10,337
"You're the best something in my life"...

842
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,367
when he makes his confession.

843
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,067
What is the word that replaces...

844
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,367
- "something"? - I don't know.

845
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,237
- Do you have any idea, Ji Won? - The best something...

846
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:19,737
- I have no idea. - Hold on.

847
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:20,967
- What was the quote? - It was "You are the best..."

848
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:22,667
- That's how I normally speak. - Okay.

849
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,367
Shall I begin?

850
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,637
From the top to the bottom

851
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:27,767
You can't sing your own song.

852
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,807
You are so lovely

853
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,507
- Accepted. - That shouldn't be accepted.

854
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:34,107
"You're the best..."

855
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:36,137
"hit song in my life."

856
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:38,537
- He dressed like a woman. - I'm sure he's wrong.

857
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,237
- It's definitely not. - Oh, really?

858
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,137
(Haha gets hit.)

859
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:45,567
- I'm not getting hit by the tray. - "You're the best..."

860
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,667
"You're the best copyrighted star in my life."

861
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:49,837
- How about "the source of income?" - Worth 15 dollars?

862
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:51,507
It's 15 dollars?

863
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,867
Try "lyricist".

864
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,137
"You're the best..."

865
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:57,507
Go, Ji Won!

866
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,267
I'm afraid that it's too old.

867
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,307
Nobody nobody but you

868
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:02,437
Is she singing "Nobody"?

869
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,037
- Nobody nobody but you - It's so old.

870
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,037
Isn't the song too old, Ji Won?

871
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:07,337
The song is not accepted.

872
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,437
I don't like anyone else

873
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,307
(How about this?)

874
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,537
She's doing great.

875
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:13,637
(She's cute.)

876
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:15,307
- Nobody, nobody - She dances better than I thought.

877
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,137
- Nobody, nobody - Accepted.

878
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,307
"You're the best lyricist."

879
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,037
Is it not correct?

880
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,437
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok. - That's okay.

881
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:28,037
Please look at me

882
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:29,137
What is he doing?

883
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:30,937
- Please look at me - That's scary.

884
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,567
- I have already - That's not acceptable.

885
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:34,737
- Why not? - Why?

886
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,437
- Why'd you hit me? - It's my turn.

887
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:39,937
(Here comes Ji Hyo's long time favourite "Hot Issue".)

888
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:41,767
- Are you singing that song again? - Hot issue

889
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:42,907
Accepted.

890
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:46,837
"You're the best melody in my life."

891
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,367
Is it wrong?

892
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,137
- The word "melody" makes sense. - Are you all right, Jin Goo?

893
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:53,607
(He's still smiling.)

894
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:55,537
- I'll give you a hint. - Okay.

895
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:58,567
The answer is really similar to Jong Kook's answer.

896
00:34:58,637 --> 00:34:59,867
- What was his answer? - What did he say?

897
00:34:59,937 --> 00:35:01,437
- What was it? - What was your answer, Jong Kook?

898
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,207
What did you say?

899
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,137
Wait. Jong Kook looks like a thug.

900
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,367
He was sitting like this and staring at me. That was scary.

901
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,107
Jong Kook, why did you do that?

902
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:13,477
(Jong Sook is a beautiful thug.)

903
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:15,867
- What did Jong Kook say? - Why did you do that?

904
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:20,637
(It's Jong Kook's time to dance.)

905
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:23,267
"You're the best..."

906
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:25,337
"hit in my life."

907
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:26,607
(The best hit)

908
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,107
(It's correct.)

909
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:32,537
- It hurts so much. - Oh my goodness.

910
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:33,767
I knew that was coming.

911
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:36,667
- What? - It's time to change the buzzer.

912
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:38,137
The women...

913
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,137
must act cute.

914
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:41,977
- Yes. - She is good at that.

915
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:43,367
She is an expert.

916
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:44,907
- She's really good at it. - I'm not good at this.

917
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,977
- Don't worry, Eunseo. You're good. - Ji Won, it's your specialty.

918
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:48,437
- That one's for you. - Don't worry, Ji Won.

919
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:49,507
- You're made for this. - This is hard.

920
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,937
- Is it my specialty? - It is.

921
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,007
- Really? I didn't know. - It's not fair.

922
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:54,607
Ji Won seems like she's still acting...

923
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,107
for the drama, "Descendants of the Sun".

924
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,837
She speaks like a soldier does.

925
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,737
That's how she normally speaks.

926
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:02,107
- How should I do it? - What should I do?

927
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,007
Ji Won, it's your specialty.

928
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,837
It will be a "Nonsense Quiz" this time.

929
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:07,977
- Yes. - Great.

930
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:09,537
- I'm not good at this. - You can do it.

931
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:11,267
- Nice. - I'm good at this.

932
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,107
- What's another way to say, - Say?

933
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,407
- "Gary went to a hot spring?" - This is so easy.

934
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:18,537
This is really easy. Just go out.

935
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:20,607
- In other words? - I've seen this before.

936
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:23,737
- Jin Goo will get hit a lot. - I had a horrible dream.

937
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:26,867
(Ji Hyo tries to act cute.)

938
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,567
- Isn't that too old? - What is she doing?

939
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:29,707
- Can I kick her instead? - Hold on.

940
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:31,337
- "Gary went to..." - Do something else.

941
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:32,407
- Can I kick her? - Don't do it.

942
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:36,137
You know, I really love you

943
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,667
(Ji Hyo is learning some new techniques.)

944
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:39,907
- I really like you - Eunseo!

945
00:36:39,977 --> 00:36:43,007
- How much? This much - She's lovely.

946
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,537
I really like you this much

947
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,067
(I really like you.)

948
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:48,337
(They're amazed.)

949
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,137
- That was so charming. - Now she needs to answer.

950
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:53,137
- What's the answer? - She's just lovely.

951
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:54,267
Gary went to a brook.

952
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:55,567
What did you just say?

953
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,667
A brook.

954
00:36:58,737 --> 00:36:59,737
- A brook? - Go, Ji Won.

955
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:00,977
Gary went to a brook.

956
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:03,037
Gary went to a hot spring.

957
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,237
I had a horrible dream.

958
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,367
- You're my nightmare! - Come on!

959
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:08,707
I think I will, too.

960
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,607
- All right. - Stop it!

961
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,807
(She acts cute.)

962
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:14,977
Accepted.

963
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:17,477
Gary is so hot.

964
00:37:17,537 --> 00:37:20,107
(Gary is very hot.)

965
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,767
(Oh, my.)

966
00:37:21,837 --> 00:37:23,207
- What did she say? - She said that Gary is so hot.

967
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:25,337
"Gary is so hot."

968
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:26,507
That was funny, Ji Hyo.

969
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,137
- Ji Hyo. - That was a good one.

970
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,137
(Ji Hyo abides by the broadcasting rules and regulations.)

971
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,007
- That's so funny. - That was great.

972
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,837
- How about "Gary's so scary?" - That was a good one.

973
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:34,977
That was clever.

974
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:36,067
- It makes sense. - Gary is...

975
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,137
"Gary is so hot" sounds nice.

976
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:38,607
I don't think so.

977
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,107
Where should I look?

978
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,007
Go, Ji Won.

979
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,107
One plus one is lovely

980
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:47,767
(She's so lovely.)

981
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,337
- Two plus two is also lovely - She's really good.

982
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,707
- Three plus three is also lovely - Ji Won's really good at this.

983
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:54,507
(I can't believe this.)

984
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,737
- You should stop at five. - Five plus five is also lovely

985
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:58,807
That's great.

986
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:03,367
Look at all the staff members. Look at their eyes.

987
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:06,137
- What's wrong with you guys? - Come to your senses.

988
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:07,307
"Gary became a new man."

989
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:08,907
- "Gary became a new man." - Gary's new now.

990
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:10,737
- It's not the answer. - Isn't it?

991
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:11,907
It's really difficult.

992
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,637
- I'm so sorry. - It's difficult.

993
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:16,037
- Do you need a hint? - Yes.

994
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:18,367
Think of a synonym for "hot spring".

995
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:21,267
- What is this? - Hurry up!

996
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:22,737
- I know the answer! - Hurry!

997
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:24,907
One plus one is lovely

998
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,707
- Two plus to is also lovely - It's not acceptable.

999
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,367
Three plus three is also lovely

1000
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:29,607
(We want to erase this from our memory.)

1001
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,037
No way.

1002
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,307
That's the answer. Come on.

1003
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,977
- I think so, too. - It's right.

1004
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:36,437
- I know the answer. - A synonym for "hot spring".

1005
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:37,667
- What is it? - What's the synonym?

1006
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,307
Please give it to me

1007
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,407
(Please give me.)

1008
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:41,707
(I will give you some punches.)

1009
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,137
You need to be hit.

1010
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,037
- I know the answer! - What can be the answer?

1011
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:46,637
- Hey. - Wasn't I cute?

1012
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,667
- Wasn't I? - Please give us more hints.

1013
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,237
- Just tell us the first letter. - The first letter.

1014
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:52,477
- Only the first letter. - Give it to us.

1015
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:53,907
One plus one is lovely

1016
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:55,367
- Just the first letter, please? - No way, Seok Jin.

1017
00:38:55,437 --> 00:38:57,477
- He's so cute! - Not at all.

1018
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,037
- He really is! - He's not cute.

1019
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:01,307
- He's dancing like a zombie. - Oh, my.

1020
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:04,367
Do you think he's cute? Do you really think so?

1021
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:06,537
I can believe him.

1022
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,607
That's not cute at all.

1023
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:12,867
- My goodness. - Just tell us the first letter.

1024
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:14,937
- All right. I will. - Oh, no.

1025
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,437
- Get ready, Eunseo. - The first letter...

1026
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:19,007
- It's "S"! - starts with "S".

1027
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:20,367
I know the answer.

1028
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,737
I got it!

1029
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:22,977
It's your turn to act cute.

1030
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:24,737
(Is he really trying to be cute?)

1031
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:25,937
- Give it a try. - Smile.

1032
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,337
What's the answer?

1033
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,037
- Act cute. - Please give me!

1034
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,567
- What's the synonym? - You know I

1035
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,067
You know, I love you

1036
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,337
- Ji Hyo is accepted. - Why is she accepted?

1037
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,707
- I get it. - Another word for hot spring?

1038
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,637
(What's another way to say, "Gary went to a hot spring?")

1039
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:43,837
Spaghetti.

1040
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:45,237
(Spaghetti)

1041
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,267
(It's correct.)

1042
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:48,567
(They dodged the tray!)

1043
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,637
Oh, my head!

1044
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:52,607
(They dodge and pretend to be hurt.)

1045
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,807
Oh, my.

1046
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:56,937
(It hits him again.)

1047
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:58,907
- What are you doing? - It was spaghetti.

1048
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:00,507
I wanted to say "spaghetti" as well.

1049
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,737
- That was close. - "Spa" was the word. I see.

1050
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,037
- Spaghetti was the answer. - Spaghetti.

1051
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,007
Female and male members will change positions.

1052
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,637
- Great. - Okay.

1053
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:10,307
- Okay, Ji Won. - All right.

1054
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,407
- Don't worry. - I'll count on you.

1055
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:12,707
- You mustn't fail. - Get ready.

1056
00:40:12,837 --> 00:40:14,137
- Good luck. - Okay.

1057
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:16,237
I guess Jong Kook is the Red Sun.

1058
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:17,977
That makes sense.

1059
00:40:18,137 --> 00:40:20,737
- He was trying so hard. - Our partners can be the Red Sun.

1060
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:22,007
We have to be cautious.

1061
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:25,067
If the Red Sun is continuing to score points...

1062
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:27,307
Wouldn't the team with the best score have the Red Sun?

1063
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:28,867
Then the game's over already.

1064
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:31,507
But trying hard doesn't guarantee a good score.

1065
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:33,037
(The Red Sun must be in the top three.)

1066
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:36,637
Among the animals that appear in the song "Tiger's Birthday",

1067
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,607
which animal made its visit to celebrate the tiger's birthday...

1068
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:42,507
and played the violin?

1069
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:44,867
- I know the answer. - I have no idea.

1070
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:47,607
(He tries to act cute.)

1071
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,667
Come on!

1072
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,567
- Ouch! - Why not?

1073
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,937
- Why isn't this cute? - Are you all right?

1074
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:54,767
- The sound was very loud. - Violin.

1075
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,937
- I'm farting! - No way, Haha.

1076
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,807
Wasn't it cute?

1077
00:40:58,867 --> 00:40:59,867
Go ahead.

1078
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,737
(He acts cute.)

1079
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:04,867
(Step back, Gary.)

1080
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,067
Why are you stopping me?

1081
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:07,567
I know the answer!

1082
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,337
(Everyone is trying to be cute.)

1083
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:10,407
Look at me!

1084
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:11,937
- I'm being cute! - Look at me.

1085
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,437
(It's manly cuteness.)

1086
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,507
- Look at my dimples. - Don't you look in the mirror?

1087
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:19,007
(It can't be any worse than this.)

1088
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,367
If you don't, then show me your face every morning instead.

1089
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:22,867
Show me your handsome face.

1090
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:26,237
(Where am I? What am I doing?)

1091
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:32,267
Have you ever thought of other careers outside the military?

1092
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,907
- I can do this! - Lovey-dovey.

1093
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:37,537
(He strives to be the cutest man in the world.)

1094
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,867
- Look at my lovely dimples! - One more time.

1095
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,437
This is crazy.

1096
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:42,637
Lovey-dovey!

1097
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:45,667
- What's that? - Why did you say that?

1098
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:47,567
- You pass! - Come on.

1099
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:48,667
No way!

1100
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:51,807
- How is that cute? - I even showed my dimples.

1101
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,337
- Say it loudly. - Fox?

1102
00:41:53,437 --> 00:41:54,767
I think it's the answer.

1103
00:41:54,837 --> 00:41:56,237
(Correct)

1104
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,337
That wasn't cute at all.

1105
00:41:58,367 --> 00:41:59,537
(He is content.)

1106
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,207
What is the pure Korean word...

1107
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,977
for "love"?

1108
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:08,977
I will give you a hint. It's a name of a girl group member.

1109
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,637
I know this.

1110
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:13,607
- It's a pure Korean word? - A word for "love"?

1111
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:15,637
- Music, please. - Give him music.

1112
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:16,767
- Give him music. - Come on.

1113
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:18,607
(This time, they need to dance.)

1114
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,067
(Wriggling)

1115
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:21,937
(What kind of dance is that?)

1116
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,267
- What's that? - That's strange.

1117
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:27,607
(He dances slightly.)

1118
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,767
(And at the right moment,)

1119
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:32,037
(he dances more slightly.)

1120
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:35,607
- What kind of dance is that? - That's a military dance!

1121
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:38,907
- Don't do that. - What is that?

1122
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:42,067
- My dimples! - What's wrong?

1123
00:42:44,507 --> 00:42:47,137
(This time, it's Gary, the hip hop warrior.)

1124
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,607
(He becomes Mr Ugly once again.)

1125
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,137
It's nothing.

1126
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:53,567
(He does the mollusc dance.)

1127
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,007
You have to pass me.

1128
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:56,837
- Pass me! - That's great, Gary!

1129
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,977
Pass.

1130
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:00,867
It's two syllables, right? "Ari".

1131
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,307
- Yes. - "Ari".

1132
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:06,407
- It's not that one? - "Ari" from "Arisoo".

1133
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:08,437
It's the Korean word for love?

1134
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,037
(Or is it that?)

1135
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:11,267
(The dance machine begins to dance.)

1136
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:12,637
Come on!

1137
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:14,437
(Here he goes.)

1138
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:15,977
(She's excited.)

1139
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:17,337
That's it!

1140
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:18,937
(Let's go!)

1141
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,267
That's it!

1142
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,707
That's so old!

1143
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,707
(He's full of vitality.)

1144
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:28,707
- That's really strange. - Oh, dear.

1145
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:30,477
- Okay. - You pass.

1146
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:32,507
I would be really annoyed if he's my boyfriend.

1147
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:34,807
I'll be embarrassed to be seen with him.

1148
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,507
That's why he dated tall and ugly girls in high school.

1149
00:43:36,537 --> 00:43:37,707
That's true.

1150
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,967
Why are you talking about things from last week?

1151
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:42,337
- Why did you bring it up? - I just thought of it.

1152
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:43,467
(What's the pure Korean word for love?)

1153
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,607
"Ara".

1154
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,467
Did he just say "Ara"?

1155
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:48,237
(Incorrect)

1156
00:43:48,307 --> 00:43:49,937
- I will give you a hint. - The sound...

1157
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:53,037
It's a four-member girl group.

1158
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:54,937
- What? - It's a four-member girl group.

1159
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,307
Are they active these days?

1160
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:58,867
Haha got it.

1161
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,137
(Haha starts dancing.)

1162
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,637
It should mean "love".

1163
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:04,037
- "Love"? - That's it!

1164
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,307
Go, Haha!

1165
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,137
- Pass. - I know what it is.

1166
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,607
- It's a four-member group. - I got it.

1167
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,337
He got it.

1168
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:12,737
Think carefully and tell us.

1169
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:15,307
- What's the word for "love"? - "Dasom".

1170
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:18,207
(Dasom?)

1171
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:20,437
(Correct)

1172
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:24,037
I am sorry.

1173
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:26,607
- We are in the same agency. - I just guessed.

1174
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:28,607
- It was "Dasom". - "Dasom" means love.

1175
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,067
Gosh...

1176
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:33,467
This time, you have to throw your shoe.

1177
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,467
- Shoe? Okay. - Yes.

1178
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,867
Here we go.

1179
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:42,607
This is one of Shakespeare's famous quotes.

1180
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:47,037
"An actor is this era's something."

1181
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:48,837
- Which word replaces "something"? - "Something"?

1182
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:51,107
- You know it. - An actor is...

1183
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,107
- this era's... - This era's...

1184
00:44:55,507 --> 00:44:56,637
(Dropping)

1185
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,867
- You're out. - You're out.

1186
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:00,367
What's the problem?

1187
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,067
(She gets hit.)

1188
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:04,537
- This is no joke. It's okay. - I'm sorry.

1189
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:07,767
- It's about an era. - Try it.

1190
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:09,337
- You pass. - I got it.

1191
00:45:10,337 --> 00:45:11,467
Mirror.

1192
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:13,867
- Gosh... - That's it.

1193
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:15,937
Gosh, I knew it!

1194
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:18,707
No way.

1195
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:20,107
It hurts!

1196
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,237
(Things are working out well for me today.)

1197
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:26,937
(Jong Kook is unusually lucky. Is he the Red Sun?)

1198
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:30,867
(Is it Ji Won, who is always passionate?)

1199
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,737
(Or is it Jin Goo, who has a suspicious look in his eyes?)

1200
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:37,467
The person I am calling should come forward...

1201
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:39,967
- and get... - Many people must've failed.

1202
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:41,937
- a Loser's Sticker. - This is...

1203
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,307
- Lee Kwang Soo. - He has to get it.

1204
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,037
He always fails for no reason.

1205
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:47,637
Why would you say that?

1206
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:49,137
- He always fails. - Gary.

1207
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,767
- Gary failed. - This is bad.

1208
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,967
- Kim Ji Won. - It's not me?

1209
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,037
- Why did she fail? - Why her?

1210
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,737
You will find out soon.

1211
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:00,137
- There must be a different rule. - The rule is different.

1212
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,337
- It must be an individual play. - Jee Seok Jin.

1213
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:03,707
I failed again.

1214
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,237
They are determined.

1215
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,667
- It's Seok Jin's day. - Next is Ji Hyo.

1216
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,107
- I failed. - What's the basis?

1217
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:11,037
I'll tell you the basis for the selection.

1218
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,467
- I didn't fail? - I didn't fail either.

1219
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,507
Those who got hit more than the Red Sun failed.

1220
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,467
(Those who got hit more failed.)

1221
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:20,967
- I got hit more than... - You didn't get hit, did you?

1222
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:22,367
- No. - Did I get hit a lot?

1223
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:23,867
Did I get hit a lot?

1224
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:26,107
So we got hit more than the Red Sun?

1225
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:27,937
So getting more answers was not important.

1226
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:30,807
- Did you get it? - No.

1227
00:46:31,337 --> 00:46:34,237
I got goosebumps. Can I get goosebumps?

1228
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:35,737
(There are two possible reasons for getting the sticker.)

1229
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:39,707
(Seok Jin, Ji Hyo and Gary failed twice.)

1230
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,137
(Descent of the Sun)

1231
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:43,707
- Let's go. - Okay.

1232
00:46:44,107 --> 00:46:45,807
- I failed twice. - I failed once.

1233
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,767
- It starts now. - You have to get three objects...

1234
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:49,737
and go to the designated area.

1235
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:51,867
Is the camera rolling all the time?

1236
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,407
Yes. It's rolling all the time.

1237
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:54,907
It's so fascinating.

1238
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:57,137
Here we go!

1239
00:46:58,137 --> 00:46:59,407
Let's go!

1240
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:02,067
- It's difficult. - It is difficult.

1241
00:47:02,107 --> 00:47:03,207
(Ji Won is in a happy mood.)

1242
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:04,507
I will search which objects include the word "won".

1243
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:07,707
(They look for objects that has the words "won" and "goo".)

1244
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,737
There are things.

1245
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:13,037
(She's fascinated again.)

1246
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:16,867
(She's easily fascinated by many things.)

1247
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,607
- I found it. - Did you find it?

1248
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:22,437
Brewed coffee.

1249
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:23,707
(Bingo!)

1250
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:24,967
That's a good one.

1251
00:47:25,037 --> 00:47:27,137
First-aid kit, grilled eggs...

1252
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:29,337
and grilled ice cream. There are many.

1253
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:32,067
- Gosh... - There are so many.

1254
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:35,407
Grilled eggs.

1255
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:36,737
(The couples need to hold hands.)

1256
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:39,207
- Did you get the car key? - Yes.

1257
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:42,637
Good. They often steal other teams' car keys.

1258
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:44,737
I am a fan of Running Man, so I know.

1259
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,637
(Jin Goo is well-prepared for Running Man.)

1260
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:51,637
Gosh, it's a perfect day to sit down and...

1261
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:54,407
- have a cup of coffee. - I know.

1262
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,507
- "Sungrasses"? - "Sungrasses"!

1263
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,067
Will "sungrasses" do?

1264
00:47:58,137 --> 00:47:59,907
- No. - Does that not work?

1265
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:01,467
(But Ji Won wants it.)

1266
00:48:01,537 --> 00:48:04,607
You can get a sweet potato latte. One sweet potato latte, please.

1267
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,307
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1268
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:07,667
This is a one-piece dress, right?

1269
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:09,437
- This will do. - I will take this.

1270
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,437
Monkey mug.

1271
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:12,837
- Monkey mug. - Let's get this.

1272
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:15,207
- This is cute. - We will take this. It's 1 plus 1.

1273
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,367
This is a one-piece dress.

1274
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:20,067
(The couples are busy getting their shopping done.)

1275
00:48:20,137 --> 00:48:21,667
- That's good. - That's good.

1276
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,307
(They take pictures of expensive items.)

1277
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,537
All right.

1278
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,507
(They are only given 100 dollars for the mission.)

1279
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:28,907
Heels.

1280
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,437
Ji Won, you are good.

1281
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:34,137
- You're smart. - I'm good, aren't I?

1282
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:35,967
- Heels will do. - Heels.

1283
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:37,737
- What else? - Oh, gosh.

1284
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:40,707
There we go.

1285
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:43,467
Insert it and take a picture.

1286
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,367
- Okay. - Here we go.

1287
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:47,507
(He takes a picture of it.)

1288
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:48,667
- There we go. - There we go.

1289
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:50,107
- We got it. - We got it.

1290
00:48:51,037 --> 00:48:53,767
(Time is up.)

1291
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:56,307
- They are here. - People are here.

1292
00:48:58,307 --> 00:49:00,067
Jin Goo, are you good at lying?

1293
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,407
- I'm bad at lying. - Today...

1294
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,367
(Kwang Soo bursts into laughter.)

1295
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:06,107
Are you the Red Sun?

1296
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:09,337
I don't even know how you become the Red Sun.

1297
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:11,667
I don't understand the rules.

1298
00:49:11,737 --> 00:49:13,237
If he turns out to be the Red Sun...

1299
00:49:13,307 --> 00:49:16,267
- That will give us the chills. - That was a good explanation.

1300
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,537
- I think it's Ji Won. - It's...

1301
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:20,407
- What's going on? - Why did you take so long?

1302
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:23,567
You found that. We couldn't find it.

1303
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:25,437
- We made a conclusion. - We know who the Red Sun is.

1304
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,867
- We're sure. - Us?

1305
00:49:26,937 --> 00:49:28,007
It's Kim Ji Won.

1306
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,967
- It's not Ji Won. - I have the sticker.

1307
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:33,567
Even if you have the sticker, you can be the Red Sun.

1308
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,137
The second mission is over.

1309
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:40,867
I will announce the ones who did worse than the Red Sun did.

1310
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,337
- Oh, dear. - They will receive stickers.

1311
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:45,607
- First is Jee Seok Jin. - Okay!

1312
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:47,737
Seok Jin always gets picked. Do you just hate him?

1313
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:50,267
- Accept him now. - I won though.

1314
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:52,407
- The next one who failed is... - Maybe it's Gary?

1315
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:53,467
(Who's the other one?)

1316
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:54,607
It's Haha.

1317
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:55,937
(Haha also got a Loser's Sticker.)

1318
00:49:56,007 --> 00:49:57,507
Why did we lose?

1319
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,967
- I have no idea. - I have absolutely no idea.

1320
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:03,507
The last one who failed is Lee Kwang Soo.

1321
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:06,237
- He's a betrayer. - Who failed?

1322
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:08,537
But he finished second.

1323
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:09,767
I know.

1324
00:50:09,837 --> 00:50:11,737
- I can't guess it. - What's the basis?

1325
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:13,937
You failed because...

1326
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:15,237
Maybe we got the same items?

1327
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:19,307
You paid more than the Red Sun did for the items you bought.

1328
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:21,207
(They are the ones who paid more!)

1329
00:50:21,267 --> 00:50:24,237
It's the price. You paid more than the Red Sun did.

1330
00:50:24,307 --> 00:50:27,067
- But they are... - Isn't it strange that...

1331
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:29,237
- Jae Seok didn't get any stickers? - They bought only cheap ones.

1332
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:35,807
(They only have one hour left.)

1333
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:39,637
- It's time for the final mission. - Is it?

1334
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:42,367
The final mission is "Master of Cheesy Acting".

1335
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:43,637
(This is their last chance to find the Red Sun.)

1336
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,837
The couple should choose a famous quote from the drama.

1337
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,607
You will also choose one famous scene.

1338
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:50,867
You will start with the famous quote...

1339
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:54,807
and end with the famous scene.

1340
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:58,607
The couple who acts the best will get extended time...

1341
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:01,707
for the ending mission at our discretion.

1342
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:03,567
You're given 40 seconds.

1343
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:07,637
For the ending mission, you'll put on gloves and open the box.

1344
00:51:07,707 --> 00:51:11,407
The female has to wear the wing inside and say, "I am an angel."

1345
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,437
If you exceed the time, cold water will fall on you.

1346
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:16,707
So you must open the box as quickly as possible.

1347
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:18,307
- It's behind you. - "I am an angel."

1348
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,437
That's Ji Won's line.

1349
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:21,207
It is Ji Won's line.

1350
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:23,067
- "I am an angel." - "I am an angel."

1351
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:25,207
Before we start the actual mission,

1352
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:28,537
we will first watch Ji Won and Jin Goo...

1353
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:29,937
- acting a scene. - They're the originals.

1354
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,037
(Jin Goo and Ji Won will show an example.)

1355
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:33,667
- Will they do it? - Be quiet, everybody.

1356
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:35,837
- Come to the centre. - Please come forward.

1357
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:37,667
This is the scene.

1358
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:39,837
(What scene will they enact for us?)

1359
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:42,537
Standby and cue!

1360
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,067
(As soon as they're cued,)

1361
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:52,737
(they're immersed in the scene.)

1362
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:55,307
Where are you going?

1363
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:57,767
Are you running away again?

1364
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:03,037
I asked if you were running away again.

1365
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:08,337
(This famous quote stole the hearts of many viewers.)

1366
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:14,407
Sergeant Major Seo Dae Yeong. I have been ordered to return...

1367
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:15,737
(She slaps him mid-air.)

1368
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:17,967
(They act in perfect synchrony to the original scene.)

1369
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:20,137
To Korea.

1370
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:27,367
Tell me to wait.

1371
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:31,007
Tell me you're taking a step back as a strategy.

1372
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:35,137
Tell me you'll come back at all costs!

1373
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,967
(He grabs her.)

1374
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:55,967
(He hugs her.)

1375
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:04,267
(I would have regretted every moment I was away from you.)

1376
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:11,267
(They can't believe what they're witnessing.)

1377
00:53:12,137 --> 00:53:13,867
- Say it! - Tell her!

1378
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:16,837
- Say something! - Do it!

1379
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:19,137
- Say it! - Don't make us wait!

1380
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,707
- Say it! - Come on!

1381
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,807
- Hurry! - I'll go back in a heartbeat.

1382
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:25,737
- Say something. - Say it.

1383
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,337
Isn't this too cruel?

1384
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:30,007
- Let's do the exact same thing. - Okay.

1385
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:34,437
- I remember this scene. - Me, too.

1386
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,307
- "Where are you going?" - "Where are you going?"

1387
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:37,537
We're going to do this.

1388
00:53:37,607 --> 00:53:39,137
- We will. - It's ours!

1389
00:53:39,207 --> 00:53:40,837
- It's ours. - I want to say that line.

1390
00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:42,607
- Where are you going? - There's a lady here.

1391
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:44,737
Are you running away after stealing my heart?

1392
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:48,907
(You stole my heart.)

1393
00:53:49,007 --> 00:53:52,137
(Where are you running off to?)

1394
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:53,737
I'm going to the internet cafe.

1395
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:56,337
(Do you play StarCraft?)

1396
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,707
Why is it any of your business?

1397
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:02,137
They knew we were watching them and still acted in front of us.

1398
00:54:02,237 --> 00:54:04,437
They were immediately absorbed in the scene.

1399
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,837
That's incredible.

1400
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:08,267
Ji Won is so good. So is Jin Goo.

1401
00:54:08,907 --> 00:54:10,137
Let's try it ourselves.

1402
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:12,907
We have to be enthusiastic if we want to earn extra time.

1403
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,667
That's right.

1404
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:16,737
(She smiles like a little girl.)

1405
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:18,737
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1406
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,437
(At the sound of the cue, her facial expression changes.)

1407
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:23,707
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1408
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,107
Standby.

1409
00:54:25,907 --> 00:54:27,807
Cue!

1410
00:54:28,037 --> 00:54:31,767
(This is the scene they'll act out.)

1411
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:33,007
Are you...

1412
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,907
(This line stole every woman's heart.)

1413
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,307
still sexy...

1414
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:38,037
in the operation room?

1415
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,967
Are you...

1416
00:54:45,137 --> 00:54:46,807
still sexy in the operation room?

1417
00:54:46,837 --> 00:54:49,637
(Jae Seok is too focused.)

1418
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:52,807
I became sexier in the time we didn't see each other.

1419
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:54,437
Roger.

1420
00:54:57,867 --> 00:54:59,137
Right now, I...

1421
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:00,907
(He's very involved.)

1422
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,037
- Come on, Jae Seok. - "Right now, I..."

1423
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,037
- Why are you doing that? - Can I...

1424
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:07,067
go there?

1425
00:55:08,107 --> 00:55:09,407
I'll be waiting.

1426
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:13,267
- He looks silly. - Look at his face.

1427
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,907
- What's with that face? - He must be a fool.

1428
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:17,437
(The sun shines brighter than usual.)

1429
00:55:19,637 --> 00:55:20,667
Knock, knock.

1430
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:23,367
(Are you here?)

1431
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,567
(Are you the sweet voice behind the radio transmission?)

1432
00:55:25,637 --> 00:55:27,207
What do you think?

1433
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:30,507
Am I even sexier in real life?

1434
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:32,907
(Am I sexier in person?)

1435
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,207
Am I even sexier in real life?

1436
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:36,467
(Slapping)

1437
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:37,667
(She received the message,)

1438
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:39,437
(but his face doesn't cut it.)

1439
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:41,467
I shouldn't have seen your face.

1440
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:45,207
(Hitting)

1441
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:46,867
(She strikes him with the radio transmission.)

1442
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:49,007
(She rejects him.)

1443
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,207
Did you just hit me with the radio transmission?

1444
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:54,637
Are you allowed to do that? Are you?

1445
00:55:54,707 --> 00:55:55,807
I'm sorry.

1446
00:55:56,037 --> 00:55:57,407
- You have 60 seconds! - 60 seconds!

1447
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,137
- No way. - That doesn't deserve 60 seconds.

1448
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:01,237
(They received the longest time thanks to Ji Won.)

1449
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:04,107
- That's unfair. - Isn't this biased towards Ji Won?

1450
00:56:04,137 --> 00:56:05,737
(The producer is the judge.)

1451
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:10,467
(The gloves are too circular to provide any grip.)

1452
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:12,837
His lips protrude so it's easy for him.

1453
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:16,137
- He has the upper hand. - It's easy for him.

1454
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,467
They almost got it.

1455
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:18,637
(Underneath the wrapper...)

1456
00:56:18,707 --> 00:56:21,467
(lies another wrapper.)

1457
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:24,867
The next one. Next one.

1458
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:27,567
He's ripping it.

1459
00:56:29,437 --> 00:56:31,567
- He did it. - I think they'll make it.

1460
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:33,707
They're pretty close.

1461
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:35,067
No, they won't make it.

1462
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:36,667
All right!

1463
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:39,107
(They finally open the box.)

1464
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:41,107
- Here! - They got it.

1465
00:56:41,137 --> 00:56:42,537
Watch the time!

1466
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:44,537
We don't have much time.

1467
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:47,067
We don't have much time.

1468
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:50,437
You have 10 seconds left. In 9, 8,

1469
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,907
- and 7... - I'm an angel!

1470
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,467
Success!

1471
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:58,307
(They succeed.)

1472
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,637
We didn't get wet!

1473
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:03,207
(She does a victory ceremony.)

1474
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,067
I'm annoyed.

1475
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,667
- Good job. - Thank you.

1476
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:08,907
(Jae Seok does his ceremony.)

1477
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:12,237
- That was good. - Good job.

1478
00:57:12,707 --> 00:57:14,137
- Thank you. - So...

1479
00:57:14,707 --> 00:57:15,907
She's an angel.

1480
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:18,707
- It doesn't look easy. - My goodness.

1481
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:20,137
Next up...

1482
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,037
(Next up is Jin Goo and Ji Hyo.)

1483
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,207
They have an advantage, too. They're both actors.

1484
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,137
This will be something to watch.

1485
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:30,467
Look at Jin Goo's face. He's already into it.

1486
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:34,537
Standby.

1487
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:38,667
(What scene will they act out?)

1488
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:41,637
By the way,

1489
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,207
you look similar to being pretty.

1490
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:48,507
Cut it out.

1491
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:51,407
(This line turned every woman into a princess in a fairy tale.)

1492
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:54,237
(He thought it was corny back then.)

1493
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:57,037
(But now, he has to do the same.)

1494
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:02,067
(He stops her first.)

1495
00:58:02,137 --> 00:58:05,267
(He has to say those sweet words now.)

1496
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:06,537
You look similar to being...

1497
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:08,137
(Slapping)

1498
00:58:08,837 --> 00:58:10,307
(She slaps him out of nowhere.)

1499
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,137
She's so good at slapping people.

1500
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:13,667
(This is the difference between a drama and a TV show.)

1501
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:16,867
- What? What? - Hey...

1502
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:19,937
- What? What do you want? - Hold on for a second.

1503
00:58:21,507 --> 00:58:24,207
Don't tell me he's going to tie her shoelaces next.

1504
00:58:24,407 --> 00:58:26,137
Please don't hit me...

1505
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:29,337
I'm sorry. Please don't hit me...

1506
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,667
All of a sudden? Is he tying her shoelaces?

1507
00:58:32,737 --> 00:58:34,307
All of a sudden?

1508
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,667
(This scene...)

1509
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:44,667
(was one of the most memorable scenes from the drama.)

1510
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:53,137
(He unties her shoelaces...)

1511
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:54,767
All of a sudden?

1512
00:58:54,837 --> 00:58:57,137
(And runs away)

1513
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:59,637
(He was just faking it.)

1514
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,637
- He's running away. - Hey, stop it!

1515
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,537
(Jin Goo's quick wit stood out.)

1516
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:08,507
- You have 50 seconds! - 50 seconds!

1517
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:09,737
(They earned an 10 extra seconds as a bonus.)

1518
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:13,467
- You're at 49 seconds. - They're taking their time.

1519
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,007
I guess you want the penalty.

1520
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:17,437
They're going to get the penalty.

1521
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:19,367
(Jin Goo shows his manly side.)

1522
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:21,067
What is this?

1523
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:24,037
(This is the same urgency he showed in the earthquake zone.)

1524
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:26,907
Hurry, hurry!

1525
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:29,237
He opened the box.

1526
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:32,207
- It's open! - They're close!

1527
00:59:32,607 --> 00:59:33,807
Watch the time.

1528
00:59:34,707 --> 00:59:37,307
I'm an angel!

1529
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,007
Success.

1530
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:42,637
- That's amazing. - He's very manly.

1531
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,207
This is fun.

1532
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:46,807
Let's watch this team.

1533
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,367
My strategy was always to run away.

1534
00:59:49,537 --> 00:59:50,637
(Slapping)

1535
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:52,137
- Did you just hit me? - I did.

1536
00:59:52,337 --> 00:59:53,467
(Slapping)

1537
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:54,967
(Love fights are scary these days.)

1538
00:59:55,037 --> 00:59:56,367
You have 50 seconds!

1539
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:57,567
This isn't working!

1540
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,137
Do this first.

1541
00:59:59,237 --> 01:00:01,807
- Time's over. - There's more inside!

1542
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:04,437
(Splashing)

1543
01:00:04,507 --> 01:00:06,967
(The waterfall fell on their heads.)

1544
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:10,207
Cue!

1545
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,137
You should take care of me if you touched me.

1546
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:14,237
(Splashing)

1547
01:00:14,307 --> 01:00:16,807
(Wait...)

1548
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,267
(She punches and slaps him.)

1549
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:20,037
(A romance turns into action.)

1550
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:21,337
That came out of nowhere.

1551
01:00:21,407 --> 01:00:23,137
I thought we had a different plan.

1552
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:24,907
You have 40 seconds!

1553
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:27,907
It's not just one. There are about three more inside.

1554
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:29,737
Time's over.

1555
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:31,537
(They barely unwrapped the box.)

1556
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:33,707
(Splashing)

1557
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:35,737
(This is too early in the season for a water park.)

1558
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:38,007
- She's a ghost. - Eunseo!

1559
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,437
Yes! I'm okay!

1560
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:42,337
- I'm sorry, Eunseo! - I'm okay!

1561
01:00:42,407 --> 01:00:43,967
- Eunseo! - Yes!

1562
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:45,507
(He's not very reliable.)

1563
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:49,007
Standby. Cue!

1564
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,307
(He's acting coy.)

1565
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:54,437
Should I apologise or make a confession?

1566
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,507
(An apology or a confession?)

1567
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:58,667
Get down.

1568
01:00:58,937 --> 01:01:01,207
(I need to teach you a lesson.)

1569
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:03,337
(He's worried Haha will become a troublemaker.)

1570
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:04,437
I said, get down.

1571
01:01:06,137 --> 01:01:08,837
(This is a different kind of a date.)

1572
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:11,337
- What's that? - Isn't he crazy?

1573
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:13,307
(Shaking)

1574
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,237
- He's going to use a toy hammer. - That's scary.

1575
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:16,637
I think it's going to hurt.

1576
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:17,707
(Striking)

1577
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,407
(The hit makes him shudder.)

1578
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:21,567
This looks more like a scene from "The Chaser".

1579
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:26,437
Should I apologise or make a confession?

1580
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:30,167
(He flashes a heart.)

1581
01:01:30,237 --> 01:01:31,307
Apologise.

1582
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:32,667
(Sullen)

1583
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:33,737
I am sorry.

1584
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,637
I love you.

1585
01:01:35,707 --> 01:01:37,607
- You won't do that again, right? - Of course not.

1586
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:39,767
I am sorry.

1587
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:42,967
(I forgive you.)

1588
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:44,967
Did you smoke?

1589
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:46,567
I said, did you smoke?

1590
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:47,907
Get down.

1591
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:50,537
(I'll help you become healthier, Sweetheart.)

1592
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:51,807
He's a smoker.

1593
01:01:52,037 --> 01:01:53,437
He smoked.

1594
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:54,567
- I told you to quit. - I'm sorry.

1595
01:01:54,637 --> 01:01:55,707
He hates smokers.

1596
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:56,807
He does.

1597
01:01:57,107 --> 01:01:58,567
I smoked with him.

1598
01:01:58,637 --> 01:01:59,767
Get down.

1599
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:00,837
Me?

1600
01:02:01,267 --> 01:02:02,407
Get down.

1601
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:03,737
- Did you two smoke together? - What?

1602
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:04,867
Did you guys smoke together?

1603
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,637
Yes.

1604
01:02:06,907 --> 01:02:07,967
Ouch!

1605
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:09,867
Seok Jin smoked with us, too.

1606
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:11,607
- You know I'm 50 years old. - Just get down.

1607
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,567
You are a woman.

1608
01:02:14,637 --> 01:02:15,937
Are you going to quit smoking or not?

1609
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:18,467
- She is a woman like you. - Get down.

1610
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,507
Look at him.

1611
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:22,937
That's funny.

1612
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,637
(Jong Kook hits Jae Seok as a warning not to start smoking.)

1613
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:25,807
It hurts so bad.

1614
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:27,037
Gosh.

1615
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:28,637
- This was the most painful one. - Gosh.

1616
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:29,937
- I love you. - I love you.

1617
01:02:29,937 --> 01:02:31,237
(- Please quit smoking. - I'll try.)

1618
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:33,907
You have 60 seconds.

1619
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,637
(As they earned extra 20 seconds, they have 60 seconds.)

1620
01:02:35,707 --> 01:02:38,367
(They earned that much time with their great anti-smoking campaign.)

1621
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:40,207
I can't put the gloves on.

1622
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:43,867
(Jae Seok runs away with the box.)

1623
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:46,837
(Catch me if you can.)

1624
01:02:49,337 --> 01:02:52,137
Where are you going? Stop there.

1625
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:54,267
They're going to catch him.

1626
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:56,137
(Give it back to me!)

1627
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:00,067
How many seconds do they have?

1628
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:02,037
I am sure they can't make it. It's over.

1629
01:03:02,107 --> 01:03:03,137
It's over.

1630
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,407
You failed.

1631
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:06,437
They unwrapped just one.

1632
01:03:08,107 --> 01:03:09,737
Come here and receive the penalty.

1633
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:11,737
- Four seconds left. - They're hitting the box.

1634
01:03:12,337 --> 01:03:13,507
(He hits through the box!)

1635
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,907
(Astounded)

1636
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,037
(The box is torn.)

1637
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:22,267
What is that?

1638
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:23,437
You failed!

1639
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:25,007
- Oh, my. - You failed.

1640
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:26,407
You failed.

1641
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:27,637
- Come here. - Come over here.

1642
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:29,307
This is not how we play this game.

1643
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:32,237
(Stop there, Jae Seok.)

1644
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:35,237
(Laughing)

1645
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:36,837
We could've made it if we had three more seconds.

1646
01:03:36,937 --> 01:03:38,807
(All they needed were 3 seconds.)

1647
01:03:38,837 --> 01:03:40,937
Jong Kook, I think Jae Seok ruined everything.

1648
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:43,067
- Take him there and hit him. - Go in.

1649
01:03:43,137 --> 01:03:44,937
- I didn't... - Come with me.

1650
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:46,137
- It's not... - Come here.

1651
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:48,567
(Come enjoy the waterfall with us.)

1652
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:50,307
- Jong Kook, Jong Kook. - Stay still.

1653
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:54,067
- Wait. You can't do this to me. - Yes, we can.

1654
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,137
You can't do this. What are you doing?

1655
01:03:56,237 --> 01:03:57,637
(Jong Kook ties Jae Seok up with his t-shirt.)

1656
01:03:57,707 --> 01:03:58,907
You can't do this to me!

1657
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:00,607
What are you doing?

1658
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,037
My goodness.

1659
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:03,367
Hey!

1660
01:04:03,437 --> 01:04:06,137
(Waterfall)

1661
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:09,767
(He's soaked.)

1662
01:04:09,937 --> 01:04:14,007
(Jae Seok got doused with water after trying to interfere.)

1663
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:18,367
My goodness!

1664
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,507
(The final mission is complete.)

1665
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:21,807
All right. You've finished all of the missions.

1666
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,807
If I call your name,

1667
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:26,207
come and get your Loser's Stickers.

1668
01:04:26,267 --> 01:04:27,867
What would be the criteria this time?

1669
01:04:27,937 --> 01:04:29,837
- It's the final round. - Who'll get the stickers?

1670
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:33,007
- Kim Jong Kook. - Me?

1671
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:34,567
- Haha. - What?

1672
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,007
(Haha gets a Loser's Sticker.)

1673
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:38,007
- Jee Seok Jin. - Again?

1674
01:04:39,037 --> 01:04:40,737
- Gary. - Me, too?

1675
01:04:41,707 --> 01:04:43,807
What did they do wrong?

1676
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:45,737
- Why me? - What is the criteria?

1677
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,637
When you were acting,

1678
01:04:48,137 --> 01:04:50,907
we monitored your heart rates.

1679
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:54,767
And the losers had the lowest heart rates while acting.

1680
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:57,107
- The Red Sun must be a woman. - Right.

1681
01:04:57,437 --> 01:04:58,907
Ji Won was really good.

1682
01:04:59,337 --> 01:05:00,837
Then did the Red Sun not rank in the top three?

1683
01:05:00,837 --> 01:05:03,207
You got the stickers because the Red Sun didn't place in the top three.

1684
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,467
(They received Loser's Stickers as the Red Sun didn't place in third.)

1685
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:08,767
(Descent of the Sun)

1686
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:10,737
Who do you think is...

1687
01:05:10,837 --> 01:05:12,007
the evil Red Sun?

1688
01:05:12,237 --> 01:05:13,437
You had a long day.

1689
01:05:13,637 --> 01:05:15,067
It's been six hours.

1690
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:16,537
- Wow. - There's nothing.

1691
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,507
- It was fun. - We all did our best.

1692
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:20,137
So who is the Red Sun?

1693
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:24,037
I'll announce who the Red Sun is along with your rankings.

1694
01:05:24,107 --> 01:05:25,137
Who is it?

1695
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:26,407
Look at the screen behind you.

1696
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:28,067
- Who is it? - Here.

1697
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,307
- I can't wait. - The Red Sun will get the gift.

1698
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:32,837
- Who would it be? - I think it's Jong Kook.

1699
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:35,607
If you rank lower than the Red Sun, you get penalised.

1700
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:39,337
But if you rank the same or higher, you're exempted.

1701
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:41,507
I hope it's Gary.

1702
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:43,137
The person who ranked fifth is...

1703
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:44,467
I think the last round was not...

1704
01:05:44,537 --> 01:05:45,667
- It's Seok Jin. - Seok Jin lost four times.

1705
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:46,807
It's only me.

1706
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,237
If you're the Red Sun, you'll receive the penalty alone.

1707
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,267
(Is Seok Jin the Red Sun?)

1708
01:05:52,337 --> 01:05:53,807
- He's not the Red Sun. - He is not.

1709
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:55,507
I passed.

1710
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:57,437
- This is fun. - Let's see who lost three times.

1711
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:59,067
(Is Gary the Red Sun?)

1712
01:05:59,107 --> 01:06:00,267
That's right.

1713
01:06:00,337 --> 01:06:01,337
So it's not Gary either.

1714
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:04,107
- They weren't the Red Sun. - It's not the three of us.

1715
01:06:04,137 --> 01:06:06,037
It's Ji Hyo or Jin Goo.

1716
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:07,267
(Is Jin Goo the Red Sun?)

1717
01:06:07,337 --> 01:06:09,237
- You were so nice. - Is it you?

1718
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:10,907
- Right. - We'll see.

1719
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,137
He said, "We'll see."

1720
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,437
Lee Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo and Haha.

1721
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:19,937
If one of us isn't the Red Sun, we'll receive the penalty.

1722
01:06:20,037 --> 01:06:21,607
They are not the Red Sun.

1723
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,207
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo and Haha all passed.)

1724
01:06:23,267 --> 01:06:24,867
- They passed. - Then it's him.

1725
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,607
This is driving me crazy. Gosh.

1726
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:29,707
I feel much better to have you as my penalty partners.

1727
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:31,137
- Join us. - We should be together.

1728
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:33,267
- Come with us. - If it's Jin Goo...

1729
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:34,407
Will you show us the rest at the same time?

1730
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:37,267
(Who got 1 sticker?)

1731
01:06:37,337 --> 01:06:39,807
- It's Jong Kook and Ji Won. - I look great in that photo.

1732
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:41,237
- Is it Ji Won? - Is it Ji Won? No way.

1733
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:44,667
(Is Ji Won the Red Sun?)

1734
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:48,737
(She showed her breath-taking cuteness...)

1735
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:51,407
(and a perfect acting performance.)

1736
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,507
(Did she try her best...)

1737
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,207
(because she is the Red Sun?)

1738
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:56,707
- Is it Ji Won? - Is it? No way.

1739
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,607
(It's between Ji Won and Jong Kook.)

1740
01:06:58,667 --> 01:06:59,837
It can be Jong Kook.

1741
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:02,807
(Is the Red Sun either Ji Won or Jong Kook?)

1742
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:04,667
(Are one of them the Red Sun?)

1743
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:05,907
(Jong Kook and Ji Won pass.)

1744
01:07:05,967 --> 01:07:07,107
- Really? - We all will get the penalty.

1745
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:09,307
(Wailing)

1746
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:10,807
Let's all receive the penalty.

1747
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:12,037
(Everyone except first place will be penalised.)

1748
01:07:12,107 --> 01:07:13,567
- Is it Jin Goo? - So we have Jin Goo,

1749
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:15,567
- Jae Seok... - I'm sure it is Jin Goo.

1750
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,067
- Is it you, Eunseo? - It's Jin Goo.

1751
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,907
We can't go home tonight.

1752
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:21,207
- Who will be the Red Sun? - It's Jin Goo.

1753
01:07:21,267 --> 01:07:27,837
(Who is the Red Sun that completely deceived the others?)

1754
01:07:30,707 --> 01:07:31,767
- Who is it? - It's Jin Goo.

1755
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:33,637
- Is it Eunseo? - Is it Jae Seok?

1756
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:34,967
(Who is the Red Sun?)

1757
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:36,137
Who is it?

1758
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:39,907
(Shocking)

1759
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:46,667
(Jin Goo is the Red Sun.)

1760
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:51,907
(Jin Goo, a big fan of Running Man, fooled everyone.)

1761
01:07:53,007 --> 01:07:54,467
It's Jin Goo!

1762
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,837
This is unbelievable. He deceived us all.

1763
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,867
- Right. - He said he didn't know anything.

1764
01:07:58,937 --> 01:07:59,967
It was really fun.

1765
01:08:00,037 --> 01:08:01,137
This is unbelievable.

1766
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:03,907
- I can't believe this. - He said he didn't lie.

1767
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,267
(How did Jin Goo become the Red Sun?)

1768
01:08:05,337 --> 01:08:08,937
The Red Sun is clever, mysterious and...

1769
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:11,337
(The Red Sun is clever and mysterious.)

1770
01:08:11,407 --> 01:08:12,537
uncanny.

1771
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:17,707
(This morning, 30 minutes before the shoot)

1772
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:23,367
(The first person to arrive on set was Jin Goo.)

1773
01:08:25,237 --> 01:08:26,237
Hello.

1774
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:32,337
Jin Goo, your code name is...

1775
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:33,567
"Red Sun".

1776
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:35,367
"Red Sun"?

1777
01:08:35,437 --> 01:08:37,807
(Jin Goo's code name was Red Sun.)

1778
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:40,637
You need to hide your identity.

1779
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:43,967
What you do will become the standard for ranking.

1780
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,637
(He had to hide his identity.)

1781
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:49,837
(The operation began as soon as they began filming.)

1782
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:54,207
You should kick your shoe as far as you can.

1783
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:55,867
Okay.

1784
01:08:56,237 --> 01:08:58,277
(The sneakers Jin Goo was wearing were the Red Sun's shoes.)

1785
01:08:58,337 --> 01:08:59,407
These are the Red Sun's shoes.

1786
01:09:01,807 --> 01:09:05,837
(Although they look like ordinary shoes...)

1787
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:08,007
I'll take these off...

1788
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:10,567
and put this inside.

1789
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:16,137
(They had Red Sun marks inside them.)

1790
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:19,837
(Although he wanted to try, he couldn't because of his sneakers.)

1791
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:23,137
Red Sun,

1792
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:26,607
you must rank at least third in every mission.

1793
01:09:26,637 --> 01:09:30,137
If you fail to do so, you'll also receive a Loser's sticker.

1794
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:34,937
(He did everything he could to rank third or above.)

1795
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:36,107
Women?

1796
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:37,777
Correct.

1797
01:09:37,837 --> 01:09:39,367
You got it.

1798
01:09:40,137 --> 01:09:43,667
(His strong power came from his desire to clear his missions.)

1799
01:09:43,737 --> 01:09:44,937
I am an angel.

1800
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:46,137
Correct.

1801
01:09:46,207 --> 01:09:49,707
(Am I doing okay?)

1802
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:51,507
Can you do it?

1803
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:55,007
We'll see. But I'm pretty confident.

1804
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:57,837
Are you the Red Sun?

1805
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:00,777
I don't even know how you become the Red Sun.

1806
01:10:01,067 --> 01:10:02,737
He sounds like he's telling the truth.

1807
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,637
It's not easy to understand.

1808
01:10:05,707 --> 01:10:07,937
(He skillfully acted and fooled those who suspected him.)

1809
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:11,707
I am the Red Sun.

1810
01:10:12,737 --> 01:10:13,807
Are you surprised?

1811
01:10:13,867 --> 01:10:15,337
(He was the Red Sun.)

1812
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,437
Running Man is one of my favourite programmes.

1813
01:10:17,507 --> 01:10:20,967
And they gave me a big mission from the start.

1814
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:23,807
Yes.

1815
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:26,007
I was the Red Sun.

1816
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:27,467
Red Sun.

1817
01:10:27,707 --> 01:10:28,907
What is that? Is that a sign or something?

1818
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:31,777
- You had that in your shoes? - Yes.

1819
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,437
You can have it.

1820
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:36,237
We should do body searches before we start from now on.

1821
01:10:36,307 --> 01:10:37,307
It was so much fun.

1822
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,367
- Gosh, it makes me angry! - Why?

1823
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:45,367
(After sunset,)

1824
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:47,437
(it's time for the penalty.)

1825
01:10:47,507 --> 01:10:50,837
(It's a type of fear that they've never experienced before.)

1826
01:10:50,907 --> 01:10:52,937
("You won't be in your right mind.")

1827
01:10:53,007 --> 01:10:55,107
("All you will want to do is escape.")

1828
01:10:56,307 --> 01:11:00,067
(This pirate ship is famous in Incheon.)

1829
01:11:00,137 --> 01:11:03,207
(It brings you hardcore fear with its speed, angle and height.)

1830
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,937
(This frightening pirate ship waits for the Running Man members.)

1831
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,777
(Wolmido Island, Incheon)

1832
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:12,007
There's a pirate ship.

1833
01:11:12,637 --> 01:11:13,937
I think this is too harsh.

1834
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,777
It's too harsh for us.

1835
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,467
I can ride anything except that.

1836
01:11:17,867 --> 01:11:19,907
Do you think we'll ride the pirate ship?

1837
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:21,137
(Sorry, but you must ride the pirate ship.)

1838
01:11:22,837 --> 01:11:25,367
(This pirate ship in Wolmido Island is scarier than real pirates.)

1839
01:11:26,637 --> 01:11:28,437
(And...)

1840
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:32,607
(a man waits for them.)

1841
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,407
(Who is he, sitting in front of a pirate ship?)

1842
01:11:35,467 --> 01:11:39,367
(David McInnis)

1843
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:42,777
Okay, that's enough. Yes or no?

1844
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:46,207
(A single answer will determine it all.)

1845
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:48,277
Are you ready to face your punishment?

1846
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:50,907
(Yes or No. Your answer will determine it all.)

1847
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:52,777
It's a yes or no question.

1848
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:54,437
(Yes or No. What is your choice?)

1849
01:11:54,507 --> 01:11:58,567
Did you find the No Man of this year?

1850
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:01,037
I think the No Man is here.

1851
01:12:05,407 --> 01:12:07,867
(The competitive Kim Sung Kyun)

1852
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:09,567
(The fiery-tempered Go Ara)

1853
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:12,307
(The best detective of 2016, Lee Je Hoon.)

1854
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,137
(Next Week's Special is Race to Say No.)
