1
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:07,465
(Mysterious Hunters)

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,565
Why are you doing this to me?

3
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:10,765
Now, Kwang Soo should...

4
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:12,425
- No way!
 - Haha, get Kwang Soo.

5
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:14,795
Please leave me alone!

6
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:16,265
There's no way out.

7
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,295
(They're chasing after you.)

8
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,595
I'll never get caught. It's not possible.

9
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:23,025
(What happened to the Running Man members?)

10
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:28,965
(6 hours ago)

11
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:33,295
(Yeouido Park, Seoul)

12
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:37,865
(What is this mysterious structure in the middle of the park?)

13
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,665
Hello. Good morning.

14
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:45,625
You have to wear this.

15
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,594
Goodness.

16
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:49,825
Gosh, what is this?

17
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:50,925
(They're asked to wear eye masks.)

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,995
What's this?

19
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:53,925
Why must I wear this?

20
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,640
- Do I have to wear this eye mask?
 - What is this?

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,795
Where am I going?

22
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:00,395
Where are we heading to?

23
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,495
(Where will they be guided to?)

24
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,165
Why do I have to wear an eye mask?

25
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,373
- Hello, Gary.
 - Hi, Kwang Soo.

26
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:07,817
- Are you wearing an eye mask, too?
 - Yes.

27
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,365
- You're here.
 - Let me take this off.

28
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,895
- Hello.
 - Can I...

29
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:11,965
take this eye mask off?

30
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,465
Can I take it off?

31
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,325
I'm scared, I'm scared.

32
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,825
(What is this room in the middle of the park?)

33
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:17,895
What's going on?

34
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:19,825
Hello?

35
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,825
- Where am I?
 - Where is it?

36
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:22,895
Do I take a seat here?

37
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:24,895
- Do I sit here?
 - Where am I?

38
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,295
- There are rooms in Yeouido Park.
 - Is this right?

39
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:29,153
Kwang Soo, be quiet!

40
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:30,165
Jae Seok.

41
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:32,765
What's this sound?

42
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,625
(Suddenly)

43
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,865
- What was that?
 - Are there doors, too?

44
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,365
- My goodness.
 - What's this sound?

45
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,295
- What's the sound?
 - I think they closed the doors.

46
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,325
What's going on?

47
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,765
- Please take your eye masks off.
 - What?

48
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,425
- Do I take it off now?
 - Can I take the eye mask off?

49
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:46,995
- What is this?
 - What's happening?

50
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:49,625
(They are given...)

51
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,925
What's this? What is it?

52
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:55,395
(A box and a card.)

53
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,465
What's going on here?

54
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:58,565
(Now, they must fight temptation.)

55
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,287
"A vault hidden in Seoul has 7,000 dollars in it."

56
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,387
- "A vault hidden in Seoul..."
 - "Has 7,000 dollars..."

57
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:06,625
"If none of you open the boxes, everyone will get 1,000 dollars."

58
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,887
"But if any of you open the box, that person becomes the Prey..."

59
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:11,525
"and can get the 7,000 dollars that is in the vault."

60
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,809
"If the Prey fails to open the vault, the Prey will get a penalty."

61
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,195
7,000 dollars?

62
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:17,335
Don't open your boxes!

63
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,495
Let's all get 1,000 dollars!

64
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,525
Don't be greedy!

65
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,595
(Will they resist the temptation?)

66
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,125
You won't be able to get all of the money anyway!

67
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,065
Can we open the box now?

68
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,025
- Don't open it.
 - Don't do it!

69
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:30,765
You know what they want from us.

70
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:32,335
If you're unsure, don't open it!

71
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:35,125
- Kwang Soo!
 - No, but...

72
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,625
Seok Jin, don't open your box!

73
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,440
Can I open it now?

74
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,460
Gosh, I want to open it!

75
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,725
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,925
(Mysterious Hunters will be chasing after them.)

77
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:52,025
(24 hours ago)

78
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:57,907
(An unidentified vehicle arrives.)

79
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:00,965
(A mysterious man gets out of the van.)

80
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,025
(Ahn Sung Ki)

81
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:09,665
(He's a renown actor with an acting history of 60 years.)

82
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,725
(He has great searching skills due to his roles as a detective.)

83
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,595
(Cho Jin Woong)

84
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,795
(He's well-fit as a Hunter due to his roles from warriors to police.)

85
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,765
(Kwon Yul)

86
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,325
(With his youth and sharp senses, this actor is a handsome fighter.)

87
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,995
(Who's the last Hunter?)

88
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,625
(Han Ye Ri)

89
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:51,565
(She may seem fragile, but she embodies great power and stamina.)

90
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:53,665
Oh, no.

91
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,165
(These four Hunters are here to chase after the Preys.)

92
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:56,265
We must win.

93
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,025
- Hunters, let's go!
 - We can do it!

94
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,925
Let me explain the mission you will complete today.

95
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,004
You'll be Hunters...

96
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,065
and catch the Running Man members.

97
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,453
(We have to catch the members?)

98
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:15,265
The members will be tempted to betray each other.

99
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:19,173
You'll chase the members who decide to betray.

100
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,325
If you succeed in catching them, we'll give you this Golden Badge.

101
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,065
What percentage of gold does it have?

102
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,397
Is it 99.9 percent?

103
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,665
He was in "Silmido"...

104
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,225
and you acted as a former table tennis player.

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,665
- And you're very tenacious.
 - Of course.

106
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,495
- You were in "A Hard Day".
 - Right. I never give up.

107
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,895
- You can count on me.
 - Okay.

108
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,635
When I was here last year,

109
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,795
I didn't eliminate anyone's name tag.

110
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,904
I intentionally let them win.

111
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,195
But people said that...

112
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:50,143
I failed to eliminate any name tags and went to jail.

113
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,265
But that was my intention.

114
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:54,925
Today, however, as a Hunter, I'll make sure to win.

115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,065
Let me wear my sunglasses.

116
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,025
(I'll be different today.)

117
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,135
I think...

118
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,365
it won't be easy.

119
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,865
But we must trust each other.

120
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,295
In 1, 2, 3.

121
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:08,965
- Hunters, let's go!
 - Let's go!

122
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:14,425
(1 day before the hunt.)

123
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:18,595
(Sung Ki does a simulation chase at his house.)

124
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:24,295
(He reveals his house to viewers for the first time.)

125
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,825
(Ripping)

126
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,025
This is harder...

127
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,025
(This is not easy.)

128
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:30,725
To rip than I thought.

129
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:33,025
(He's fascinated.)

130
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,795
(He starts training.)

131
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,380
I'll be hiding like this.

132
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,065
(A standard technique to remove the name tag)

133
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:52,395
(This is called the Leech Technique.)

134
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,595
(I'm exhausted.)

135
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:58,765
(He hides himself.)

136
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,417
I'll hide myself in corners like this.

137
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,687
(This is called the Hiding Technique.)

138
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:03,995
And I will...

139
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,295
lower my body like this.

140
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:11,625
(Hiding Technique: One must put down his title and crawl.)

141
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,765
This is difficult.

142
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,865
I think Jae Seok is really great.

143
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,595
I think it'd be better to avoid him...

144
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,425
than to confront him.

145
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,665
Jong Kook...

146
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,125
is a hard opponent to face as well.

147
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:30,795
However, I think Seok Jin...

148
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,753
will be the easiest to face.

149
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:36,425
And as Kwang Soo is really tall,

150
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,795
I'll attack him from a lower angle.

151
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:44,125
Although it might be a bit embarrassing,

152
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:48,625
I'll attack him below the legs.

153
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,595
My right side looks better.

154
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,295
I should've sat like this.

155
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,125
(It's a bit late to regret now.)

156
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,025
Dear Running Man members,

157
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,825
you'd better be prepared.

158
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:08,225
Tomorrow, we, Hunters, will be there to hunt you down.

159
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,465
(Be prepared to be hunted.)

160
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,695
Running Man.

161
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:11,925
(Head Hunter Ahn Sung Ki)

162
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:15,295
My mission is to kill you.

163
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,725
(Sung Ki is ready to carry out his mission.)

164
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:21,965
(D-Day)

165
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:23,965
Today,

166
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,465
we're fully prepared.

167
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,995
(Jin Woong also looks very determined.)

168
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:31,665
So the members must be prepared, too.

169
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,765
No, I'm not nervous.

170
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:36,525
Seriously, I am not.

171
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:38,565
I'm not nervous.

172
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,365
I don't pick my nose when I'm nervous.

173
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,325
Don't worry.

174
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:46,825
May I stop by the restroom?

175
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,925
Is it because you're nervous?

176
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,465
(You seem nervous.)

177
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,795
What do you mean by that?

178
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,225
(I just want to prepare myself for the race.)

179
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,495
You should know me by now.

180
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,850
Anyway, you'll see.

181
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,465
I'll teach the betrayers a big lesson.

182
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,165
I'll see you soon.

183
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,650
(Running Man members, you'll be arrested soon!)

184
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,325
Hello, guys. You're here.

185
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:10,365
It's good to see you.

186
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:11,965
Hello.

187
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,025
Look at the set-up.

188
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,625
- Please explain this to us.
 - This is...

189
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,525
- Please sit here.
 - If you look at the monitor,

190
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:21,465
it shows the rooms where the members will be tempted.

191
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:22,865
I see. The "Room of Temptation"?

192
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:25,865
You'll watch them live as they hesitate in the rooms.

193
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:26,995
(They can watch the members in the rooms.)

194
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:28,265
- That sounds fun.
 - Right.

195
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:32,094
(The members don't know that the Hunters are watching them.)

196
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,125
It's starting.

197
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:34,625
My goodness.

198
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:36,795
They're our Preys.

199
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,383
(Will they be able to fight temptation?)

200
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:43,097
Who do you think will betray the others first?

201
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:44,295
Kwang Soo.

202
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,925
(Ye Ri thinks Kwang Soo will betray first.)

203
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,110
I think...

204
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,465
Jong Kook won't betray.

205
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,650
Because he can beat others with his strength.

206
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,495
I think it will be Gary. It's hard to grasp what's on his mind.

207
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,495
Right. Gary is difficult to read.

208
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,595
I think Gary is poker-faced.

209
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,595
We all can get 1,000 dollars each!

210
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:07,995
(Among the members...)

211
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,125
This box...

212
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,453
(Who will open the box first?)

213
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,825
Can I open it?

214
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,025
Can I...

215
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,395
(Lured by temptation, he reaches for the box.)

216
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,395
Don't open it!

217
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,765
- Don't open it.
 - Let's take 1,000 dollars each!

218
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,125
- You know how this works.
 - Don't get greedy!

219
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,565
- Wait.
 - Seok Jin, don't open it!

220
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:24,795
I'll open...

221
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,595
(He opens it.)

222
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:31,964
(There's a mission card and a note with strange numbers.)

223
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,777
"You've unlocked Pandora's Box. You're now a Prey." I'm a Prey?

224
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,395
- He opened it.
 - Seok Jin opened it.

225
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,150
(This is interesting.)

226
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,260
He opened it. Oh, dear.

227
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,265
- That makes Seok Jin the first.
 - Right, he's the first Prey.

228
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,495
"If you're eliminated before opening the safe, you'll pay..."

229
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,695
Pay? I have to pay a fine?

230
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:51,695
Why would we have to pay?

231
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,265
- Wait.
 - Don't open it, Seok Jin!

232
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,625
- Seok Jin!
 - Don't open what?

233
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,325
The box in front of you!

234
00:09:58,325 --> 00:09:59,665
- I already opened it.
 - What?

235
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,065
- What?
 - Seok Jin!

236
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:03,865
Did you open it?

237
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:06,825
You should've read it before opening it. Can't you read?

238
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,895
I just opened it.

239
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:11,125
- We should catch him fast.
 - That's right.

240
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,280
(Kwang Soo chooses to betray for 7,000 dollars.)

241
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,665
If Seok Jin opens it...

242
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,465
Kwang Soo opened it.

243
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,353
Kwang Soo became a Prey.

244
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,365
- Why did you open it, Seok Jin?
 - Really.

245
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,795
- Why did you open it?
 - You only had eight hours.

246
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,095
- Why would you open it?
 - Now we can't share...

247
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,765
- 1,000 dollars.
 - You could've waited eight hours!

248
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,325
Gosh, I really didn't open it!

249
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,925
I have no choice now.

250
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,991
(More members start to betray.)

251
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,495
- Jae Seok opened it, too.
 - Look at this.

252
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:48,395
Hurry up and open it! "When the door opens with a siren,"

253
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,143
"the Hunters will chase you!"

254
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,735
What's this? "The location of the safe and..."

255
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,125
(All 7 Running Man members open the box.)

256
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,565
"You'll find the location of the safe and the password..."

257
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:57,625
"if you go to the place in the photo."

258
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,225
"If you open the safe before getting eliminated, you get 7,000 dollars."

259
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,925
This is crazy. What is this?

260
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,625
(They must find the locations using the photos.)

261
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,665
But these are old photos.

262
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,225
This is ridiculous.

263
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:11,425
(They must find out the location of the safe and the password.)

264
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,325
(This is the car plate number they need to escape.)

265
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:14,965
- Did they all open the box?
 - Hold on.

266
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,725
- We will find out where they are.
 - Yes.

267
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,065
We must catch them all.

268
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,195
Arrest everyone.

269
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,887
(A moment's decision made them the Preys.)

270
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,195
I'm in trouble.

271
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,725
- I'm going to lock the door.
 - Goodness.

272
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,065
(Avoid the mysterious Hunters and obtain 7,000 dollars.)

273
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:30,773
- What's going on?
 - We have to go.

274
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,665
Gosh, why do I always have to be chased?

275
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:33,795
(The door opens as the siren rings.)

276
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,825
- I'm going to lock the door.
 - I'm going now.

277
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,825
- What is this?
 - We must catch them all.

278
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:40,625
Do we have to run away?

279
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:43,495
We have to run away.

280
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:46,465
- Where are we?
 - Jae Seok.

281
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:48,025
(They start running.)

282
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,925
Who is...

283
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,095
- Where do I go?
 - Who is...

284
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,025
Wait! My shoes!

285
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:56,495
(Without knowing who the Hunters are, they just start running.)

286
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:58,265
- Be careful. I don't know.
 - Run fast!

287
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,865
- It opened.
 - There it is.

288
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,025
(Seok Jin's location is shown on the screen.)

289
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,325
- Let's go.
 - Who's...

290
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,565
- Run fast!
 - Where do we go?

291
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,695
Wait, my shoes!

292
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,225
(Will they get arrested or will they open the safe?)

293
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,825
- Who's hunting us?
 - Run faster!

294
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:16,895
I don't know.

295
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,195
(7 Running Man Preys vs 4 Hunters)

296
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:20,883
Where is the car?

297
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,595
- It's all Seok Jin's fault.
 - 71?

298
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,187
- I already saw what was in it.
 - 1771.

299
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,670
- Hurry up!
 - Is this the car?

300
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,025
- 1771.
 - Is this it?

301
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,225
(They must get to the car in order to escape.)

302
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:32,225
- Where is the car?
 - "61 Heo."

303
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:33,895
- Why did you open the box?
 - Hey.

304
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,743
- I didn't see the paper.
 - Why did you open it?

305
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,325
- Don't do it!
 - It's here!

306
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,395
- Where?
 - Where is it?

307
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,225
- Drive!
 - Here it is.

308
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:45,425
Drive fast! Hurry up! Don't let them come in!

309
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,725
Get out.

310
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,707
- Hey!
 - Go away.

311
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:52,095
- Hurry up and move.
 - No!

312
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,925
- Go to the back.
 - I will go to the back.

313
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,595
- Go.
 - Will one person do?

314
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,833
Hey.

315
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,394
- I'm nervous.
 - Why did you open it, Seok Jin?

316
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,195
- But...
 - Why did you open it?

317
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:04,925
- Anyway,
 - This wouldn't have happened.

318
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,963
- You shouldn't have done anything.
 - Let's look at the photos first.

319
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,425
- We have to find the place.
 - It's Hangang Bridge.

320
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,295
- It's Hangang Bridge.
 - Isn't it Hangang Railway Bridge?

321
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:14,065
- Hangang Railway Bridge.
 - It's that place near the bridge.

322
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,665
- It's there.
 - Is it Miari Ridge?

323
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,795
No, isn't it the ridge near the Hangang Railway Bridge?

324
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:20,065
- Miari Ridge is...
 - I see. The location...

325
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,414
- Aren't there four locations?
 - There are four locations.

326
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:23,665
Did you look it up?

327
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,365
(Hints about the safe are at these locations.)

328
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:30,625
(Using the hints, they must find and open the hidden safe.)

329
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,025
Let's go to the place that's easiest to find.

330
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:37,065
I think we need to go to one place to find more hints.

331
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,383
- We can't know everything.
 - The Hangang Railway Bridge it is.

332
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,143
- All right. Let's go.
 - Here we go.

333
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:43,765
I'm honoured to serve you, Detective.

334
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,656
It's an honour.

335
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,390
We're on Olympic Expressway.

336
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,043
- We're on it, right?
 - Yes.

337
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,865
Anyway, we have to catch Seok Jin...

338
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,895
to get hints. We have to catch him.

339
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,095
Then we will go to the areas nearest to there.

340
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:02,143
- And they'll all be on the GPS.
 - Right.

341
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:07,100
If we pass through this, it's Gongdeok Intersection.

342
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,065
They will move like this. So if we go straight like this,

343
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,495
- we can block their path.
 - Block them.

344
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,295
I think they're near Nodeul-gil.

345
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,765
- You are right.
 - Right.

346
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,356
You are right.

347
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,425
Let's divide into two teams.

348
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:24,025
One team can go arrest them.

349
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:27,095
And another team can watch their movements.

350
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:30,087
- Let's go on a stake out.
 - Right.

351
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:33,125
I feel reassured to be here with two ex-detectives.

352
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,495
(Cho Jin Woong and Ahn Sung Ki of "Veteran" and "Two Cops")

353
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:39,395
- Should we enter this way?
 - Shouldn't we enter over there?

354
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,295
They wouldn't be tracking our location, would they?

355
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,765
- The Hunters are...
 - No way.

356
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,565
- Perhaps our mobile phones...
 - We should turn them off.

357
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,325
If you think you will get eliminated, you have to...

358
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:50,995
try to make more people get eliminated.

359
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,725
- Then the fine will get smaller.
 - That's right.

360
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,765
- So...
 - I'll warn you. I won't die alone.

361
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,825
This is the dilemma.

362
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:02,695
- Right.
 - I think the park is that way.

363
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,125
- No, it's...
 - Why are you so sure?

364
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,165
Looking at the river's shape...

365
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:09,195
- You can tell by looking at that?
 - Of course.

366
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,665
A river's shape doesn't change.

367
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,195
Isn't that a lie?

368
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:15,165
- Look.
 - You can tell by the river?

369
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,195
The river meanders like this.

370
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,425
- Gosh, this is ridiculous.
 - I can't work with you guys.

371
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,925
- Let's split up.
 - I am pretty sure about this.

372
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,325
- Hey, listen to him.
 - This is frustrating.

373
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,965
- Look. The river bends like this.
 - I give up.

374
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:28,295
It could be Gangnam.

375
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,495
- This is Hangang Railway Bridge.
 - It's here, then.

376
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,865
- Enter that road.
 - Shouldn't we exit to Noryangjin?

377
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,065
Let's enter it.

378
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,665
- Let's go there even if it's not.
 - I'm certain it's not this place.

379
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:40,936
As Haha said, let's go even if it's not the right place.

380
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:43,495
If that map is right, isn't it this way?

381
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,225
- It's this way.
 - The bridge is here.

382
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:47,065
I think the place Jong Kook mentioned before...

383
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,495
- could be right.
 - Where was that?

384
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:50,065
- Seonyudo Island?
 - Yes.

385
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,225
- Look over there.
 - What?

386
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:53,695
- It's here!
 - Hey.

387
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,125
- It's here.
 - Look there.

388
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,725
It was here! Do you see?

389
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,865
- I was right!
 - I told you it was the north!

390
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:02,295
Amazing. So we found it?

391
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,233
I was right about the river meandering.

392
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,365
- You're right, Gary.
 - Right?

393
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,965
- I can't believe it.
 - I've been to Han River many times!

394
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:12,095
- How did we find this place?
 - I lived in Ichon-dong...

395
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,325
- for years.
 - We are unbelievable.

396
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,325
- Be careful, everyone.
 - Be careful.

397
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,907
Get off first.

398
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:19,225
Aren't we supposed to find the hints?

399
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,995
Goodness. Hurry and look for the hints.

400
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:23,667
- The Hunters might be here.
 - Do you think so?

401
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,325
This is amazing. How did we find this place?

402
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,765
(The Preys get out of the car and one camera films them.)

403
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,895
We have to find them. There are hints here.

404
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,195
They arrived.

405
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,695
It's the parking lot.

406
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,665
- In Ichon-dong?
 - Yes.

407
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,453
It's the parking lot at the bank of Han River.

408
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,595
Look at this.

409
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,765
- All the members are there.
 - Is that so?

410
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:47,883
Jong Kook, Haha, Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

411
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,395
I think we need to sneak in there.

412
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,895
Do you have the video? We should predict where they...

413
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,025
might park their car and which direction they might walk.

414
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,695
We must catch one person first.

415
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,125
That means we have to catch them...

416
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,595
- before they get back in the car.
 - Yes.

417
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,725
(The Preys are searching the banks of Han River.)

418
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:09,595
(He spots something and sprints.)

419
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,935
(There is a flag.)

420
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,887
- Gary found something.
 - Really?

421
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,217
(There is a flag.)

422
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:17,325
It's here.

423
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,795
(What mission must they accomplish?)

424
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:20,225
(The mission card)

425
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:23,665
"Find three codes and go under Hangang Bridge."

426
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,725
We have to find three codes.

427
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,295
So this is how it looks.

428
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,050
- So it's there.
 - Right. That side.

429
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,283
- We should go down there.
 - Okay.

430
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,565
(Shall we begin the hunt?)

431
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,297
It's such a beautiful day.

432
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,656
(It's a perfect day for hunting.)

433
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:45,919
(Jin Woong specialises in acting as a detective.)

434
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,435
They went to the opposite side. They went towards Wonhyo Bridge.

435
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,395
(From mystery crimes to chases, Ahn Sung Ki is ready for anything.)

436
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:01,165
(Be prepared, Preys.)

437
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,680
(Hunters vs Prey. What will happen to them?)

438
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,865
Ji Hyo, it's here.

439
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,495
If we move like this, we will get noticed.

440
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,373
- I know.
 - They will see us.

441
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:11,435
We will hide, too. Should we shoot from a distance?

442
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,607
That's good.

443
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,665
- And we shouldn't be like this.
 - Right. Let's not stay here.

444
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,895
- Let's move inside.
 - That's a good idea.

445
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,563
I should check what's inside.

446
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,695
(They go inside the dock.)

447
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:25,065
Where are you going, Jae Seok?

448
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,565
It seems dangerous, but why am I following him?

449
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,695
- We didn't check this place.
 - There's something inside.

450
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,665
(They must find 3 codes to get the hint for the safe.)

451
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:36,995
(What is this?)

452
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,695
(They see something and begin to walk faster.)

453
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:41,995
These are life vests.

454
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,825
Will we wear these and ride the boat?

455
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,225
What's "R2"?

456
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,325
Why do the stickers have "R2" on it?

457
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:49,665
(It's not just R but R2.)

458
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,965
- What's this?
 - What's "R2"?

459
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,765
(Not knowing that the Hunters are here, they're collecting the codes.)

460
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,435
- This is the hint. This is it.
 - But what is it?

461
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:58,625
We are supposed to get three hints.

462
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,707
Eight.

463
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,225
It's stopped at eight.

464
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,325
Today's my day.

465
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,601
- Come here.
 - Wait. "R2" is...

466
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:11,856
- It says "R2" on these life vests.
 - There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

467
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,935
Why are there so many?

468
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,265
There are 9 life vests. There are 8, 9.

469
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:19,065
- It's R1 and R2. We need one more.
 - R1 is 8 o'clock.

470
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,025
Why don't we catch them like this?

471
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,465
Yul, will you go along the river?

472
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,565
- Do you want me to?
 - Yes.

473
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,495
(They group into pairs and take two different routes.)

474
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,607
- Ye Ri, can you go over there?
 - Over there?

475
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,595
We should move outside of the pavement.

476
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:36,225
(The Hunters speed up the hunt.)

477
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,395
Keep yourself on this side.

478
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:42,495
(Jin Woong plans the strategy and leads his team members well.)

479
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,495
Where are they?

480
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,225
Do you know where they are? Did you see them?

481
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:48,633
Were they over there?

482
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,033
Are they over there?

483
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,195
Thank you.

484
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,395
I guess R2 refers to the number of hints. Don't you think so?

485
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,295
(The Preys are still looking for more hints.)

486
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,267
(A picture frame?)

487
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,865
We only need to find R3.

488
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:04,165
We need to find 3 in total. We've found 2 so far.

489
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,095
Couldn't there be something on the second floor?

490
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,195
- Have you been there?
 - I couldn't find anything there.

491
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,465
(Jae Seok hurries to the boat.)

492
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,725
Which one do I need to wear?

493
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,125
(He successfully collects 3 hints.)

494
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,265
Why are you wearing it?

495
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:18,495
(Now, he must go under Hangang Bridge.)

496
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,495
Hey! What are you doing?

497
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:22,595
- What's going on?
 - You need to...

498
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,495
- find the hints before you come.
 - What are you doing?

499
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,965
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin has found R3 as well.)

500
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,665
What is it? Can we ride the boat now?

501
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:34,195
Hey.

502
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,825
- What are you doing, Seok Jin?
 - I know the hint, too.

503
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,265
- Do you?
 - Yes.

504
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:40,695
- Hey, Jong Kook.
 - Are you on the boat already?

505
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:41,935
The hint must be inside.

506
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,467
- We can leave now, Sir.
 - Let's go.

507
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,765
Somehow, the Unlucky Trio has gathered again like this.

508
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,625
- We mustn't betray each other.
 - You know,

509
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,725
now we're on the same team. We're on the same boat.

510
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,225
- No way.
 - He doesn't know the hints.

511
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,695
I think it's 8, 2 and 9. It's 8, 2 and 9.

512
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:55,725
- It's okay because I know now.
 - I can't...

513
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,065
- believe this.
 - We mustn't betray each other.

514
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:58,565
Honestly, we don't have to.

515
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,143
We really don't need to betray each other.

516
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:01,926
What? Where are we? There must be something around here.

517
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,495
They said we should go underneath Hangang Bridge.

518
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,765
(There must be something nearby.)

519
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:09,095
Although we're the Unlucky Trio, we must win something this time.

520
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,595
- We should.
 - We can do it.

521
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,065
- Look!
 - What is that?

522
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,295
(There's something there.)

523
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:17,065
R1 squared...

524
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,365
Can you please drive slowly?

525
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,125
- Can you turn around?
 - Please turn around.

526
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,225
- Sorry.
 - I saw it. I saw it.

527
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,836
I can read the signs briefly. R1, R2 and R3.

528
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:25,095
They are 2, 9 and 8.

529
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,365
So what's R1 squared?

530
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:29,065
(The clock indicated 8 for R1.)

531
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:30,195
It's R1 squared?

532
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,695
It must be...

533
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:33,036
- It's 8 times 8, so it's 64.
 - 64.

534
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,435
- Calculate. We need a calculator.
 - 64 and...

535
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,125
- The square root of R2 is 3.
 - Three...

536
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,295
- minus R3 cubed.
 - Minus.

537
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,765
(The number of people in the picture was 2, so R3 is 2.)

538
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,570
So 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 2 is 8.

539
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,563
Eight? 8 times 8 is 64. So 64 plus... No, 64 minus...

540
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:47,025
Did we calculate the root correctly? The square root of 9 is 3, right?

541
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,195
I'm not sure about square roots.

542
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,580
(We didn't think we'd have to do maths on Running Man.)

543
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,225
- Am I right? 61 minus 8 is 53.
 - It's 53.

544
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,295
Is it 53?

545
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,395
The answer is 53.

546
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:57,765
- All right. Let's go.
 - Please start the engine.

547
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,265
We should take the train.

548
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,890
We should take the train instead of driving a car.

549
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,625
- We must part now.
 - Yes, we should.

550
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,495
Excuse me, where is the closest subway station nearby?

551
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,704
I think we should just go to Miari Ridge.

552
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:09,883
Shall we?

553
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:13,765
- Should we go by car?
 - Yes, we should.

554
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:15,965
I think we should run now.

555
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,125
Are they over there?

556
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,425
(The Hunters surround and approach the Preys.)

557
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,495
Lower your stance.

558
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:23,725
(Yul and Ye Ri lower themselves and draw near.)

559
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:24,725
This way.

560
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,095
Look. 12 minus 5 is...

561
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,565
(The Preys are about to leave.)

562
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,665
- It's seven. So seven and...
 - Wait, Gary isn't here yet.

563
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,125
Hurry up.

564
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:34,395
- There they are.
 - Who? Where?

565
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,425
There. Right there.

566
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:37,765
(The Preys are right over there.)

567
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,395
There. Can't you see people gathered around over there?

568
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:40,795
There are quite many.

569
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:41,825
What? What's wrong with this?

570
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,465
I can't start the car.

571
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,465
(They don't have the car key.)

572
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,665
- I think he took the key. No?
 - You're right.

573
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,825
- Jae Seok took the key.
 - Did he take the car key?

574
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,065
- Did he?
 - Is it not in the car?

575
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:52,625
There they are.

576
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:55,125
(Sung Ki and Jin Woong spot the Preys, too.)

577
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,325
- There they are.
 - Who are they?

578
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,025
I don't feel so good.

579
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:00,165
We must look around.

580
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,095
There is some kind of security...

581
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,195
(I think there's something around here.)

582
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:10,165
(They run down boldly to approach more quickly.)

583
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:12,325
(He's careful.)

584
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:16,125
(Let's see...)

585
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,325
- There they are.
 - They are all there.

586
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:19,965
(They're all gathered over there.)

587
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,725
(The exploration is over.)

588
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,165
- Okay.
 - Are we ready?

589
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,395
It's time for the hunt.

590
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,695
(The time for the hunt has come.)

591
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:29,565
- Something is wrong.
 - What's going on?

592
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:30,665
There's nothing but a river.

593
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,995
Are they trying to catch us all at once?

594
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:36,665
I can feel that someone is watching me. That's how I feel.

595
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:38,925
They are all over there.

596
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:43,765
(They are watching...)

597
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,765
(us!)

598
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:49,025
- Are they near?
 - Where are they?

599
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,425
They must be around to catch us.

600
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:51,825
- I think so.
 - Yes. I feel like that, too.

601
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,695
- We've got nowhere to run.
 - Something's wrong.

602
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,425
- We must run to the sea.
 - There's nothing but a river.

603
00:23:56,425 --> 00:24:00,165
(He runs swiftly and hides behind the staff members perfectly.)

604
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,325
Jin Woong!

605
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,795
Jin Woong! I can see you well.

606
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:06,390
That's Jin Woong. Jin Woong.

607
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,195
Come on. Jin Woong.

608
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:09,425
I can see you so well.

609
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,897
- Jin Woong, we can see you clearly.
 - Was it you?

610
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:14,025
You're clearly visible.

611
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,707
(185cm is too tall of a height to hide behind someone.)

612
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:17,725
- Long time no see.
 - He was hiding.

613
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,665
Hey, Jin Woong. Wait, I'll talk to him. Jin Woong.

614
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:22,904
We don't know the hints. We missed the boat and we know nothing...

615
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:24,095
- about the hints.
 - Who knows the hints?

616
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,865
Jae Seok, Seok Jin...

617
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,165
- Hello.
 - and Kwang Soo are not here.

618
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:29,195
- They will come back on a boat.
 - It's okay.

619
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:30,295
- They must come back.
 - They are down the river now.

620
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:31,765
- Are they coming here now?
 - They are.

621
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:32,865
- Go and ask them.
 - Really.

622
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:34,025
- You can wait here.
 - Wait. Then...

623
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:35,765
- Okay.
 - We know nothing about the hints.

624
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,695
We can't do anything if we don't know the hints.

625
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,195
- Excuse me, Sir.
 - Is there...

626
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,295
another person over there?

627
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:41,495
Where is he?

628
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,017
Is there someone else?

629
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:44,565
(Who is he with?)

630
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:46,753
- He's Ahn Sung Ki.
 - It's Mr Ahn Sung Ki.

631
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:47,895
What?

632
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:49,825
(Oh my goodness.)

633
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,295
- Hello, Mr Ahn.
 - He's really Mr Ahn.

634
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:52,965
- Goodness.
 - This is amazing.

635
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,295
Hello, Mr Ahn!

636
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:58,025
(They never imagined that he would come.)

637
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,625
(It's Sung Ki's first time to be on a variety show.)

638
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,695
Line up, everyone.

639
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:04,825
- Wow.
 - We should stand in line.

640
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,665
(Jaw dropping)

641
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:10,117
- Wait, how do I wear this?
 - Good to see you, Mr Ahn.

642
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,725
- Hello, Jong Kook.
 - Hello, Sir.

643
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:13,065
Hello, Mr Ahn.

644
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:14,495
(They show respect to the great actor.)

645
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:16,236
- So...
 - Please let me explain.

646
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:17,825
- We didn't find all the hints.
 - We're lost right now.

647
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:19,425
- We didn't get anything.
 - Jae Seok and the others...

648
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:22,465
- Those three people abandoned us...
 - They betrayed us.

649
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:24,065
and went out to find another hint under the bridge.

650
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,795
- We're stuck here.
 - So far,

651
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:28,465
I've watched a few episodes of Running Man...

652
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:29,865
and the people here are all nice.

653
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:30,995
- Thank you.
 - Am I?

654
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,325
- Who's not here? Kwang Soo is not.
 - You're right..

655
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:33,725
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin and Jae Seok.
 - Kwang Soo, Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

656
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,546
I've been on Running Man before. They are abandoned and it means...

657
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:38,765
- they are all useless.
 - You're right.

658
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:39,865
- Catch Jae Seok.
 - Anyway...

659
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:41,995
- Yul.
 - There's nowhere we can go now.

660
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:43,365
- I don't mean that.
 - We're friends, right?

661
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,825
- Yes, we are.
 - They know the hint,

662
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:47,365
- so you must catch them first.
 - She's right. We're stuck here.

663
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:49,304
- The dock is right over there.
 - We have limited time.

664
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,925
- We have limited time.
 - Really?

665
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,725
- Yes, so we must move quickly.
 - You're in a hurry.

666
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,553
Yul, I think we should split up here.

667
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,856
(He thinks it's best that they split.)

668
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,095
- Yul.
 - Yes?

669
00:25:58,095 --> 00:25:59,765
I think we should move now, quickly.

670
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,495
The dock is over there.

671
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,265
(Ripping)

672
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:06,765
(He floats like a butterfly...)

673
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,665
(and rips the name tag like a bee.)

674
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:10,410
- Why did you do it?
 - That's okay.

675
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,695
(Gary is out.)

676
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,025
- How can I put it on again?
 - We don't need it.

677
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,453
It doesn't really matter.

678
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:17,033
There you go. I told you that we don't need this.

679
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,780
I told you. We don't need your name tags.

680
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,365
- Calm down.
 - So we'll become your spies.

681
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:21,625
- I really mean it.
 - All right. Come here.

682
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,295
- Don't rip it off, Jin Woong.
 - No, you shouldn't.

683
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:24,695
(Ripping)

684
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,995
This is how you become our team.

685
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:29,165
(That's how you become our team.)

686
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,725
Why did you rip it off? I'm out now.

687
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,295
He has to get changed if he gets his tag ripped.

688
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:34,560
- Really?
 - Are you still drunk?

689
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,365
You shouldn't come to work if you're drunk.

690
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:37,565
(This doesn't look good. I must run.)

691
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:39,495
What have you done?

692
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,765
- I wanted to rip off your name tag.
 - What are you doing?

693
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,325
- Jong Kook is out now.
 - He's really strange.

694
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,565
What is he doing?

695
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:47,265
- Okay, let's go.
 - He's so strange.

696
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:51,760
Sung Ki, I think you should persuade them...

697
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,495
- with your warm image.
 - That's right.

698
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:54,695
That's the most effective.

699
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:56,195
- We should persuade them and...
 - Okay.

700
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:58,825
we should go together. We can't beat them with our strength.

701
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,265
Sung Ki, let's act friendly to them...

702
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:02,465
and rip about two name tags here.

703
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,965
I watched a few episodes and the people here are all nice.

704
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,225
- Thank you.
 - Really?

705
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:09,425
- He knows the truth.
 - You're right.

706
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:12,714
(While the Preys were off-guard, Jin Woong winked.)

707
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,480
(Jin Woong signalled Yul.)

708
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,265
(Gary was the target. They distracted Gary...)

709
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,880
(and suddenly ripped his name tag.)

710
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,965
(While everyone was confused,)

711
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,425
(he didn't miss the chance and ripped Jong Kook's name tag, too.)

712
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:31,425
(He easily eliminated Jong Kook from the game.)

713
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:34,425
He's really strange. What is he doing?

714
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:37,795
(With a perfect plan and incredible acting, their plan has succeeded.)

715
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,395
(Jong Kook and Gary are out.)

716
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:46,265
(Haha catches on and quickly runs away.)

717
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,995
(Haha, don't leave me behind.)

718
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,125
Haha is running away.

719
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:53,695
Where is the car?

720
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,725
(Haha's in a rush.)

721
00:27:55,725 --> 00:28:00,495
(Surprise! Hunter Ye Ri ambushes him.)

722
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,395
There he is.

723
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,265
He's there. I can see him.

724
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:05,725
He's over there.

725
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,395
(Ji Hyo hides behind Jin Woong.)

726
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,925
(It's a fierce chase.)

727
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,995
Why are you running? You told me you're not but you're running away.

728
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:13,125
- I got really scared.
 - What?

729
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:15,265
- Let's talk later.
 - Why are you suddenly running away?

730
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,625
My goodness.

731
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,125
(Ji Hyo hides herself in a staff's car.)

732
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:21,565
I mean it.

733
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:24,665
(Ye Ri continues to chase Haha.)

734
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:27,765
(She's not giving up.)

735
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:35,125
(She's been chasing Haha for 1.3km.)

736
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,125
I can't run any more.

737
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,865
(She's exhausted.)

738
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:40,395
He runs really well.

739
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:48,495
(After a long chase, Haha finally escapes from Ye Ri.)

740
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,825
(She's more like an athlete than an actress.)

741
00:28:54,795 --> 00:29:00,117
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo successfully grabs a taxi after hiding.)

742
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:01,365
Hello.

743
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,695
First of all...

744
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:07,825
(She's out of breath.)

745
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:09,925
I'm on the run right now.

746
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,256
I have...

747
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:16,125
to get out of here first.

748
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,165
When will we reach Miari Ridge?

749
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:20,825
- Goodness.
 - It's really far.

750
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:23,733
Are we near Yeouinaru Station?

751
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:26,465
- Why are we going around together?
 - I have no idea.

752
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,995
It just worked out this way.

753
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,465
It was the three of us last week, too.

754
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:31,295
- It's the three of us again.
 - My goodness.

755
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:33,365
We're ahead of the game.

756
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:36,995
You just got a free ride. We found the clues.

757
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:41,165
- You almost fell behind, Seok Jin.
 - Let's take the stairs.

758
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:43,970
You got on right before we left.

759
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,910
Come on.

760
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,065
Don't go around in groups like you're impalas in a meadow.

761
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:52,495
- You just keep following me around.
 - I'm just listening to you.

762
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,125
It's because I'm scared.

763
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:57,165
- They're coming!
 - Where?

764
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,865
(Startled)

765
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,087
(Where? Where? Where?)

766
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,795
(They run away in a heartbeat.)

767
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:05,995
You saw what they did, right?

768
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:08,395
- My goodness.
 - Let's not do this to each other.

769
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:11,125
This was what I was talking about. This is part of your nature.

770
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,765
- You're these kinds of people.
 - Why did you push me?

771
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:17,595
- You pushed me and ran away.
 - I was really scared.

772
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:18,725
(Will they survive until the end?)

773
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:19,795
Oh, gosh.

774
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,860
(The first hint is 53. Where are they headed next?)

775
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,133
Something's ringing.

776
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,295
It's so hot.

777
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:27,865
Let's get going.

778
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,095
- Why?
 - I got a hint.

779
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,295
What is it?

780
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:34,365
"Yeon". That's where the safe is located.

781
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,965
- I got it, too.
 - It says "Yeon".

782
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,295
- It starts with "Yeon".
 - Let's go.

783
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,165
(Once they find the correct location of the photos, they get a hint.)

784
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:43,965
Green? What's "Yeon"?

785
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:45,725
(Their first hint is "Yeon".)

786
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:47,595
- What's "Yeon"?
 - Not a lot of places have "Yeon".

787
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,446
There's Yeonnam-dong and Yeonhui-dong.

788
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:52,017
- Let's grab a taxi.
 - All right.

789
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,695
- Where to?
 - Let's go to Miari Ridge.

790
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:55,965
- There's a lot of traffic.
 - Watch your backs.

791
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,995
We don't know who's chasing us.

792
00:30:58,995 --> 00:31:00,065
(They must find the hints...)

793
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,165
(before the Hunters find them.)

794
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,365
- Let's get on.
 - Should we get on this one?

795
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:03,417
Sure.

796
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,625
(They must hurry to find the last hint.)

797
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:06,425
Hello.

798
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,595
- Miari Ridge, please.
 - Miari Ridge?

799
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:14,330
Is this how it used to look?

800
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,056
This isn't easy.

801
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,965
It looks similar. There are the stairs.

802
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:20,565
I think it'll be hard to find.

803
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:23,695
It's just a normal village. How are we supposed to find it?

804
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:26,265
It can't be in Busan, right?

805
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,495
- Maybe. There are a lot of stairs.
 - It says Dongrae, though.

806
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,895
"Dongrae Supermarket"?

807
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:32,395
(It clearly reads "Dongrae Supermarket".)

808
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:36,595
The photo looks like it was in the 50s.

809
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,495
- This is it!
 - What?

810
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:43,695
- You're right!
 - It's Hongje-dong.

811
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:47,065
- Wow, Kwang Soo.
 - See?

812
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,665
- You found it.
 - How did you find it?

813
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:52,165
I looked up "Dongrae Supermarket" and this came up.

814
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:54,095
- That's what you searched for?
 - I see.

815
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:56,365
- I told you to try it.
 - That's awesome.

816
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,095
- Let's go there right after.
 - It's right!

817
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,495
No, we should go to Hongje-dong first.

818
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:03,095
- Sorry, can we go to Hongje-dong?
 - Is it in the area?

819
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:06,495
- It's actually closer.
 - Take us to Hongje-dong, please.

820
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:08,325
This is awesome.

821
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:11,717
(How are the rest of the members doing?)

822
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,965
- Hello?
 - Where are you?

823
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:17,095
We're headed towards the next place. Where are you?

824
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:20,465
Jong Kook and Gary got eliminated already.

825
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:21,565
- They did?
 - Really?

826
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,667
They are one of the Hunters now.

827
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:28,825
Haha and I managed to run away.

828
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,065
What happened after?

829
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:33,625
Jin Woong, Mr Ahn Sung Ki,

830
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,795
Kwon Yul and Ye Ri are the Hunters.

831
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:40,365
And Jong Kook and Gary went to their team.

832
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:42,665
- What about you and Haha?
 - Oh, my.

833
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:46,595
- We don't know where to go.
 - Hey, hey.

834
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:49,725
Look up Dongrae Supermarket in Ant Village, Hongje-dong.

835
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:51,677
Ji Hyo, go to Miari Ridge first.

836
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,865
Find a hint there and we'll trade information.

837
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:55,495
Didn't you go there yet?

838
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:58,065
- We couldn't.
 - We didn't have time.

839
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,565
Stop lying. Be serious!

840
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:04,456
Go there first. You should go to Miari Ridge.

841
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:06,595
- Didn't you go there, Jae Seok?
 - You should head there.

842
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:08,495
- Didn't you go there though?
 - No, we didn't.

843
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:10,925
- I'll be on my way then.
 - All right.

844
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:13,825
- Sure.
 - I told you we didn't go there!

845
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,765
- If in any case,
 - I said it hundreds of times...

846
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,595
and you didn't even listen to me!

847
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,095
- I wasn't lying to you!
 - Ji Hyo.

848
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:23,295
- How many times did I tell you?
 - She hung up.

849
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:25,463
Don't hang up on me!

850
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:26,965
She hung up a while ago.

851
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:29,095
Wait, Mr Ahn is on our show?

852
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:31,995
- Mr Ahn comes on variety shows?
 - He's on our show?

853
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:33,995
- He has a name tag on his back?
 - Is he really here?

854
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:37,095
- I've never seen him on shows.
 - I'm not mistaken, right?

855
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,195
- Oh my goodness.
 - Is it the Mr Ahn I know?

856
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:43,195
- Is it the guy who said "Shoot me"?
 - "Shoot me."

857
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:44,825
- "Shoot me."
 - It goes like this.

858
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:47,065
- "Shoot me."
 - "Shoot me."

859
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:48,125
"Shoot me".

860
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,336
"Add cream to the coffee. Don't mix it."

861
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:53,165
That's the most important part.

862
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:57,940
Show him the picture. He might recognise the place.

863
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,765
Where is this? It looks like a hospital.

864
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:02,965
- There's a person on crutches.
 - Hold on for a second.

865
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,425
(Hold on.)

866
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:09,233
(Let's see.)

867
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:13,095
My duty is not to send you off but to kill you.

868
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:17,495
(They are scared.)

869
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:24,025
(He plans to gather all of his experience and catch the Preys.)

870
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:28,065
This looks like Marronnier Park.

871
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,225
- By Daehangno?
 - Right.

872
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:33,595
- Really?
 - It's the College of Liberal Arts.

873
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,225
- He's amazing.
 - He knows everything.

874
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,346
- He knows it all.
 - That's amazing.

875
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:42,730
- There's a guy on crutches.
 - Right.

876
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,425
It looks like Seoul National University Hospital.

877
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:47,625
- The one by Marronnier Park?
 - It's in Daehangno.

878
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,995
- I think it's by there.
 - They must be headed there.

879
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:54,265
They must be at Dongsung-dong or Miari Ridge.

880
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:55,725
- Should we split up then?
 - Yes, we should.

881
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:58,595
- Where should we go?
 - We'll go together.

882
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,625
- Let's do this!
 - We can do it!

883
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:07,225
- Have you done this before?
 - This is my first time.

884
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:11,965
Once you get absorbed in the games, you get competitive.

885
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:14,404
You'd think it's just a variety show...

886
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,225
- but you get into it.
 - I...

887
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,335
When you see others run away, they get on your nerves.

888
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:21,925
I think you'll naturally get into it.

889
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,565
Seok Jin is passing by Hongje Station right now.

890
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,390
- Hongje Station?
 - He's headed to the intersection.

891
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,795
- I guess he'll take that way.
 - What's near there?

892
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:34,335
(There must be something near Hongje Station.)

893
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:36,911
- Good luck.
 - Thank you, Sir.

894
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:38,965
Let's post this on the internet.

895
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:41,125
Are we at the right place?

896
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:43,365
I looked up "Ant Village".

897
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,225
I don't think we're at the right place.

898
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,925
- Wait. This is a dead end.
 - We have to go 3.5km more.

899
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:53,295
- This can't be right.
 - Seok Jin.

900
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:54,911
(There's an iron fence.)

901
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:56,965
How could this happen?

902
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:59,995
- What did you look up?
 - I looked up "Ant Village".

903
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:03,925
- Is this wrong? Is it different?
 - My goodness.

904
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:08,395
If we stay here like this, we'll be caught in no time.

905
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:12,495
Let's get on another taxi and go to the supermarket in Ant Village.

906
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,295
Where are we?

907
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,865
We're giving too much time to the Hunters.

908
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,477
- Let's take the bus.
 - We have to get on number seven.

909
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:21,765
- Jae Seok.
 - We take number seven?

910
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:23,995
Trust me. You just need to follow me.

911
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:26,495
- Hey.
 - We take number seven from here.

912
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:28,835
- I got this.
 - Come on.

913
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:31,695
- We'll get off at the last stop.
 - Seriously.

914
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,765
(They listen to Kwang Soo and wait for bus number 7.)

915
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:36,204
- The Hunters have a car, right?
 - Of course.

916
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:39,884
We can't give them so much time. It's all your fault, you punk.

917
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:43,025
How did we get here again? Let me ask you that question.

918
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:45,925
- We got here thanks to you, but...
 - I know...

919
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:49,195
we got this far because of you, but the Hunters might be ahead of us.

920
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:51,495
- Replay the camera again.
 - Who found R1 and R2?

921
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:55,025
I found R2 and you found R1. You didn't know about R3.

922
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:58,195
I saved you guys when you were hanging off a cliff.

923
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,857
Did you know what R3 was?

924
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:01,395
You would have been out if it wasn't for us.

925
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:03,495
You would have been absorbed by them.

926
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,335
They would've used you again.

927
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:07,894
You would have been done if you were on their side.

928
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:08,995
(I feel lonely.)

929
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:11,065
You should consider yourself lucky for being on the leading team.

930
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,495
Who's the leading team?

931
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:14,495
I'm the main lead here.

932
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:15,925
This is the leading team because of me.

933
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,765
- From the look of it,
 - It's because of me.

934
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:20,925
- I'm the lead in this episode.
 - I did all the work.

935
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:22,995
- The cameras are all focused on me.
 - What are you talking about?

936
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:26,277
- Look at the cameras.
 - You're supposed to focus on me.

937
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,295
- Hey!
 - I know.

938
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,965
Turn your camera around. Why are you focused on him?

939
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,925
No way.

940
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:36,025
(What's that?)

941
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:39,995
Hey, hey. Hey!

942
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:43,065
(Is it a Hunter?)

943
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,895
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo run for their lives.)

944
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,165
Come here, Kwang Soo.

945
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,695
- It's not them.
 - It's not?

946
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:53,037
- It's not?
 - It's not them.

947
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,125
- Oh, my. It's not them?
 - Did you see them?

948
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:57,195
Why did you guys run?

949
00:37:57,195 --> 00:37:58,995
- It's not them.
 - It's not?

950
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,395
(Herbivores must be fast to survive in the wild.)

951
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:01,417
- Hey.
 - Oh, gosh.

952
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,046
(They also require sensitive eyes and ears.)

953
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:05,687
We're progressing pretty well.

954
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:06,917
(The crisis has brought them closer together.)

955
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,895
I hope they didn't pass here already.

956
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,835
- We're around here...
 - Right.

957
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:19,560
- and they're still here.
 - They haven't moved.

958
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,565
They're in the same area.

959
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,380
- What could be there?
 - There's...

960
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,465
a mountain village by there. It's near Segeomjeong.

961
00:38:28,965 --> 00:38:31,225
- Is there such a thing?
 - There used to be.

962
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:35,453
- Sangmyung University is there now.
 - I see.

963
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:37,460
- Is it a mountain village?
 - Yes.

964
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,725
I don't think they would have found it.

965
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:42,895
- Did they have a new hint?
 - It wouldn't have an obvious spot.

966
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:47,395
- Oh, gosh.
 - Should we have taken a taxi?

967
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:50,295
It would have saved so much time if we took a taxi.

968
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,725
- We took a detour.
 - The Hunters will be on us.

969
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:55,695
We can't give them enough time.

970
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,095
(They're out of time and energy.)

971
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,295
I'm tired.

972
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,765
Do you think he can give us a ride?

973
00:39:02,765 --> 00:39:03,895
Excuse me.

974
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:06,165
(He's our lifesaver.)

975
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,295
Excuse me.

976
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,795
I'm sorry, but are you on your way to Ant Village by any chance?

977
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:14,465
- Would it be okay with you?
 - Is it all right?

978
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:17,067
- Thank you, Sir!
 - Thank you.

979
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,365
- Thank you so much.
 - Thank you.

980
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,894
We were waiting for the bus, but it didn't come.

981
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:24,465
- Thank you so much.
 - I think we're almost there.

982
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:25,835
Isn't that Dongrae Supermarket?

983
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:28,025
We're looking for Dongrae Supermarket right now.

984
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:31,225
The murals are beautiful.

985
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,265
(Ant Village, Hongje-dong)

986
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:35,965
(Ant Village is finally revealed.)

987
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:43,617
(The murals tell colourful stories of each household.)

988
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:46,295
(There is a hint hidden inside this village.)

989
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:48,565
- There's the R flag!
 - There it is!

990
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,695
- We're here!
 - Hurry.

991
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:52,395
We can get off here.

992
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:54,765
- Thank you.
 - Thank you! Thank you very much.

993
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:55,835
(They arrive at the second destination.)

994
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:57,365
- There's the supermarket.
 - Take care.

995
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:59,025
There's the supermarket!

996
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,495
- Jae Seok.
 - Come here.

997
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:06,625
"Find Mr Kim Jae Pyung. If you ask him what the password is,"

998
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,725
"he'll give you an object instead of an answer."

999
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:11,225
- It's Mr Kim Jae Pyung.
 - How are we supposed to find him?

1000
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,725
How are we supposed to find Mr Kim?

1001
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,065
(It's like searching for a needle in a haystack.)

1002
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,965
Maybe it's the owner of the supermarket.

1003
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:23,795
Sorry, do you know a Mr Kim Jae Pyung in the village?

1004
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,625
- It's Kim Jae Pyung.
 - It's Kim Jae Pyung.

1005
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:28,400
- He lives down there.
 - Where?

1006
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,425
- It's over there?
 - He lives by the senior centre.

1007
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:32,995
- Thank you.
 - Thank you!

1008
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,795
(They move fast.)

1009
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,125
Okay. Thank you.

1010
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:42,095
We have nowhere to go if they come after us.

1011
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:46,125
We have nowhere to run.

1012
00:40:46,665 --> 00:40:48,495
Think about Jong Kook being with them.

1013
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:51,025
If we meet them, we're done for.

1014
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:52,125
(If the Hunters come, they are trapped.)

1015
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:55,925
- We're fast.
 - We got here faster than I thought.

1016
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:58,665
(They have "Yeon" and number 53 as their hints.)

1017
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,160
What if they're staking out here?

1018
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,665
This is so intense. I'm so nervous.

1019
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:09,125
- Hello.
 - We're looking for Mr Kim.

1020
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,335
(Have they found Mr Kim's residence?)

1021
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,125
- Is it you?
 - They're people on television.

1022
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:17,217
- We are.
 - Are you Mr Kim Jae Pyung?

1023
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:18,665
That's me.

1024
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:20,495
- Hello.
 - Hello.

1025
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,065
- Nice to meet you.
 - Hello.

1026
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,263
Can you give us a hint?

1027
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:26,695
Is that it?

1028
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,565
- Thank you, Sir.
 - Thank you.

1029
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,365
- We were looking for you.
 - Take care of yourself.

1030
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,725
- Thank you.
 - Please be healthy.

1031
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,265
(Why did Mr Kim give them a hint?)

1032
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:40,095
- Is there a hint inside the book?
 - There must be.

1033
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,495
Is this a map of the village?

1034
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:46,335
- Page 25.
 - Page 25.

1035
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:49,925
It's too risky here.

1036
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:53,465
(The front page has a bunch of unknown numbers and letters.)

1037
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,746
What's 16L and 4W?

1038
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,335
The 16th line?

1039
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:00,465
("P" is for page, "L" is for length and "W" is for word.)

1040
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:02,395
- That's the 16th line.
 - It's "Two".

1041
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,495
- It says "Two".
 - "Two".

1042
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:05,965
- It says "10".
 - That's 20.

1043
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,225
- It says "7".
 - That's 27.

1044
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,195
- We had 53 before.
 - It's 53 and 27.

1045
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,395
- 53.
 - It's 53 and 27.

1046
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:15,165
- Let's get going.
 - 53 and 27.

1047
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,243
(They have "Yeon" and number 53 and 27.)

1048
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,295
- I don't believe them.
 - Let's go through this area.

1049
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:23,765
To get to Seoul National University Hospital, you take a left.

1050
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:27,965
Are there any old buildings left at the hospital?

1051
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:31,595
This is the building. It's on your right.

1052
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:32,880
I think they're there.

1053
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,765
- The security team is there.
 - It's the right way.

1054
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,335
We're at the right spot.

1055
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:39,595
- You were right.
 - I knew it.

1056
00:42:39,595 --> 00:42:41,625
You can never beat a veteran.

1057
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,835
He's amazing.

1058
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,456
(Follow my lead.)

1059
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:47,353
How did you know just by looking at an old photo?

1060
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:49,465
- It was in black and white.
 - I used to come here a lot.

1061
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:52,495
- There was a theatre here.
 - I see.

1062
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:55,795
They would never imagine that we're here already.

1063
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:58,495
This is the right place.

1064
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,765
- It's right.
 - Exactly!

1065
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:01,465
- Right?
 - It looks exactly like the photo.

1066
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:03,806
It looks exactly the same.

1067
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:06,483
It's still the same building. It hasn't changed at all.

1068
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:10,365
"Former Administration Building of Seoul National University."

1069
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:14,295
- You're awesome.
 - He's incredible.

1070
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:17,165
It looks exactly like the picture.

1071
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:20,195
So this used to be the main building?

1072
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:22,835
It was the main building when they took the picture.

1073
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:27,163
Let's call the other team and see how far they got.

1074
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:30,835
Somebody is near us. Haha is close to us.

1075
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:32,495
Wait a second.

1076
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,425
I'm scared to go anywhere.

1077
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:37,895
(Haha approaches Daehangno.)

1078
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,195
(He's busy searching the web.)

1079
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:42,295
It's the Seoul National University Hospital.

1080
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:44,925
Thank you.

1081
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,595
We took a taxi so we must be ahead of them.

1082
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:49,995
(Haha believes he's the first to arrive.)

1083
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:53,695
(The Hunters are waiting right across the street.)

1084
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:56,365
I'm definitely faster than them.

1085
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:59,965
He's coming near us.

1086
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:02,695
- All right.
 - Welcome.

1087
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:10,095
(Haha barely escaped. Now, he crawls back towards the tiger's den.)

1088
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:18,195
(Welcome to the worst place you could ever be at.)

1089
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:24,295
We'll surround him like this.

1090
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:27,007
(But Haha is nowhere to be seen.)

1091
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,495
(Why isn't he showing up?)

1092
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:33,825
- Jong Kook.
 - Yes.

1093
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:36,765
You can go that way and I'll go around.

1094
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:38,025
Sure.

1095
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:41,343
- Is he still in the same spot?
 - Yes. Let's move towards him.

1096
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,595
I think there might be...

1097
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:47,425
- Why isn't he moving?
 - He might have gotten off...

1098
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:50,695
but doesn't know where to go.

1099
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:53,395
Haha is not moving.

1100
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:57,595
Right, he knows that we can track him down.

1101
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:01,095
- No way.
 - Check the GPS.

1102
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,295
You have a GPS?

1103
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:05,665
(Is Haha trying to trick them?)

1104
00:45:05,665 --> 00:45:07,395
- Haven't you seen Haha?
 - Haha?

1105
00:45:07,395 --> 00:45:08,495
He took the subway.

1106
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:09,825
He took the subway?

1107
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:13,395
(The subway?)

1108
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:14,695
(He's dazed.)

1109
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,025
He left a while ago.

1110
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,280
He did, right?

1111
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,065
(What just happened?)

1112
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:25,025
This is perfect.

1113
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,665
This is great.

1114
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:28,365
(Why is Haha on the subway?)

1115
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:31,195
If we are going to do this,

1116
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:35,260
why don't I just head back to Ichon-dong and get the hint?

1117
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,625
I'll be back in the same spot for the second time today.

1118
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:39,695
(He plans to go back to Ichon-dong and find the hint he missed.)

1119
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,025
Thank you.

1120
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,025
We took a taxi.

1121
00:45:43,025 --> 00:45:45,495
(He gets off first since he knows that they can track him down.)

1122
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:49,265
(As soon as he gets off, he heads straight to the subway station.)

1123
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:52,495
What's more incredible about this...

1124
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:55,356
is that you cannot track people when they're underground.

1125
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,495
(The GPS doesn't work underground.)

1126
00:45:59,095 --> 00:46:00,365
Hey, is he gone?

1127
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:04,095
Haha took the subway.

1128
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,653
- Did he?
 - Yes.

1129
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:07,725
- From here?
 - Yes, and...

1130
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,973
we cannot track him once he enters the underground space.

1131
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:13,265
He knows that we have the GPS.

1132
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:16,756
He asked me if I had a GPS before.

1133
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:17,904
My goodness.

1134
00:46:17,904 --> 00:46:19,695
(This is a game of wits. It's not an easy pursuit.)

1135
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:23,195
- Look!
 - So 8 times 8 is 64.

1136
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:25,865
- Use a calculator.
 - It's 53.

1137
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:27,495
What's this?

1138
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,625
(Ji Hyo gets a hint at Miari Ridge.)

1139
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,695
"Find a card that's missing."

1140
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:32,265
(She has number 19 and "Hee".)

1141
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:34,995
- Are you Mr Kim Jae Pyung?
 - Thank you.

1142
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:37,225
- It's "10".
 - It's "10".

1143
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:39,165
- It's 27.
 - It's 53 and 27.

1144
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:40,265
Right.

1145
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:44,825
(Haha currently has no hints.)

1146
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:48,765
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo have completed their mission.)

1147
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,465
- How are we supposed to get down?
 - Should we...

1148
00:46:51,465 --> 00:46:53,125
steal the staff's car?

1149
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:56,125
Oh, dear. We can't do this on our own.

1150
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,425
- Jae Seok.
 - We need a car.

1151
00:46:57,425 --> 00:46:59,895
- If we take a taxi...
 - Let's just take this car.

1152
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:03,065
- Can we take this?
 - May we borrow this car?

1153
00:47:03,495 --> 00:47:04,765
Sorry, Sir.

1154
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:06,665
(They have to get away no matter what.)

1155
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:08,180
It's so hot.

1156
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,910
(What's the Unlucky Trio's next target?)

1157
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,065
- What?
 - Why?

1158
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:14,653
It's the Korea Arts and Culture Education Service.

1159
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:17,495
- Where?
 - It looks exactly like the photo.

1160
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,210
- This is it, right?
 - Let me see.

1161
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,925
- This is it.
 - Let's see.

1162
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,925
- It looks exactly like the photo.
 - You're right.

1163
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:25,025
Is it the Korea Arts and Culture Education Service?

1164
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,225
Excuse me, Sir. Do you know where this is?

1165
00:47:27,225 --> 00:47:29,465
- Hurry up.
 - It's the College of Liberal Arts.

1166
00:47:29,465 --> 00:47:31,125
It's in Hyehwa-dong.

1167
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,825
- What is it again?
 - He's right.

1168
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:34,995
He's right. It's Seoul National University.

1169
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:36,265
It's Seoul National University Hospital!

1170
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,283
- This is it, right?
 - Let me see.

1171
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:41,365
(He searched the internet in detail.)

1172
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,365
- Let's see.
 - I'm on a roll today.

1173
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:44,965
- We have to stick together.
 - It used to be...

1174
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,295
the former administration building of the university.

1175
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:49,895
It's the Korea Arts and Culture Education Service.

1176
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:51,895
- Did you find it?
 - It's here.

1177
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:53,295
- Kwang Soo.
 - I found it!

1178
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:55,665
You're awesome. It's your day today.

1179
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:56,925
You're awesome.

1180
00:47:56,925 --> 00:47:58,495
What's this car doing?

1181
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:01,295
- Jong Kook! How did you get here?
 - We finally run into you.

1182
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,325
We are looking for the flag.

1183
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,565
- We're looking for the mission.
 - Really?

1184
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:07,495
I think it must be inside.

1185
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:08,825
We have to go this way.

1186
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:10,495
- There are tents.
 - Is that the right building?

1187
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,265
- It must be inside.
 - There are so many tents.

1188
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,825
- Let's go inside.
 - I think it's this side.

1189
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:17,025
Go on SNS and search hashtags for Ji Hyo and Running Man.

1190
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:18,465
Do it for all of them.

1191
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:20,456
Hashtag Miari Ridge.

1192
00:48:20,456 --> 00:48:22,165
- I found it.
 - Gary's calling.

1193
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,965
It's Hyehwa!

1194
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:25,225
- They're in Hyehwa?
 - They are!

1195
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:26,665
- Who's there?
 - Jin Woong is there.

1196
00:48:26,665 --> 00:48:28,965
- How did you know?
 - I found him via hashtag!

1197
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:31,595
- See? What did I tell you?
 - Turn the car around!

1198
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:33,825
- My goodness!
 - Miari Ridge it is!

1199
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:36,495
- It was posted 3 minutes ago!
 - What were they doing there?

1200
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:39,795
He's roaming the streets with Mr Ahn.

1201
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,695
We can't go there!

1202
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,595
- Would they come if we're here?
 - They won't.

1203
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:46,865
(The entire team wanders about.)

1204
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:48,925
- Here's the flag.
 - Here it is!

1205
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,465
- Here it is.
 - Mr Ahn.

1206
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:52,125
There's the flag here.

1207
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,795
They're all here.

1208
00:48:53,795 --> 00:48:55,883
- Are they?
 - They've arrived.

1209
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:58,156
We have to get them in one shot if possible.

1210
00:48:58,156 --> 00:48:59,256
(The Preys are heading to Daehangno.)

1211
00:48:59,256 --> 00:49:01,395
We can't take the car through the streets.

1212
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:03,365
We're here.

1213
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:05,965
- It's here.
 - This is the building.

1214
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:07,725
That's the building from the photo. This is amazing.

1215
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,495
- This is it.
 - It is, right?

1216
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:10,733
That's the one we saw in the photo.

1217
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:12,925
We'll let them come in...

1218
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:15,695
- and corner them together.
 - Right.

1219
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:18,495
Hide well so that they can't see us.

1220
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:22,095
(Sung Ki and Ye Ri hide in the basement.)

1221
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:26,065
(They plan to drive the members from each floor.)

1222
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,887
I hope he successfully escaped. But we never know.

1223
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,077
Oh, my phone is ringing.

1224
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,165
Who is it?

1225
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:32,295
(Kwang Soo's phone starts ringing.)

1226
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:33,943
- Who is it?
 - Hello?

1227
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:35,425
- Hello.
 - Hi.

1228
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:37,840
(Who is she?)

1229
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,865
(Is it a trap made by the Hunters?)

1230
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,365
We've recently launched...

1231
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:49,065
our new black garlic extract in Uiseong, North Gyeongsang-do.

1232
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:53,825
(It's a telemarketing call.)

1233
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,300
(She says she will even send him a free sample.)

1234
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,797
How does that sound? Hello?

1235
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,895
I'm sorry. But I'm busy right now.

1236
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:03,895
- Okay.
 - Bye.

1237
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:05,565
Bye.

1238
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:09,100
Goodness.

1239
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,465
Gosh.

1240
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,465
I thought...

1241
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:14,065
- it was Ye Ri.
 - Right.

1242
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,165
Because it was a woman.

1243
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:17,765
I thought we were receiving a mission.

1244
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,465
- The call was from Uiseong?
 - Goodness.

1245
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:23,125
Do we have to go to Uiseong?

1246
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,125
- Wait.
 - Black garlic extract?

1247
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,767
(While the trio is distracted by the telemarketing call...)

1248
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:27,895
Okay.

1249
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:29,695
(Hunters are preparing to entrap the Preys.)

1250
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,595
(Yul goes to the rooftop to watch them.)

1251
00:50:32,595 --> 00:50:34,453
I think they're not here yet.

1252
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:35,765
It's too quiet, right?

1253
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:43,895
(Jin Woong is waiting at the entrance.)

1254
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:48,425
(And he locks himself in.)

1255
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:49,425
Wait, it's locked.

1256
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:52,765
(He has locked himself in.)

1257
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:54,765
My goodness. What should I do?

1258
00:50:56,365 --> 00:51:00,395
(He calls Yul for help.)

1259
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,425
- Hello.
 - Yul,

1260
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:05,395
I'm locked up in the men's restroom on the first floor.

1261
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,295
Please come down here and open the door for me.

1262
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:11,025
Okay. I'm on the rooftop now. I'll make my way there.

1263
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:18,495
(He desperately hopes that the Preys aren't here yet.)

1264
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:21,165
Jin Woong is locked in the men's restroom.

1265
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:24,065
(He hears noises.)

1266
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:33,265
(The Preys must be near.)

1267
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:34,765
We have to find the place on the photo.

1268
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:36,725
It should be around here.

1269
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:41,125
(The Unlucky Trio carefully approaches the building.)

1270
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,125
Watch out.

1271
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,425
(Yul runs to the second floor.)

1272
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:49,665
Jae Seok's here.

1273
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:54,165
- Watch out.
 - He's wearing a white shirt.

1274
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:59,065
(Jin Woong also senses the Preys near him.)

1275
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:01,336
- Jin Woong.
 - Yul, go up now.

1276
00:52:01,336 --> 00:52:03,925
(Jin Woong calmly tells Yul to hide.)

1277
00:52:04,865 --> 00:52:05,895
Okay.

1278
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:09,725
(The Preys are right in front of the building.)

1279
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:19,795
(Jin Woong also hides himself to hunt them.)

1280
00:52:19,795 --> 00:52:23,865
(But he only finds himself in the restroom.)

1281
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:25,025
What am I doing here?

1282
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:27,725
Look at this.

1283
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:31,825
(The Unlucky Trio secretly enters the building to get a hint.)

1284
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:33,765
There it is.

1285
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:35,625
It's here. It's right here.

1286
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:37,925
Hey, I think someone has been here before us.

1287
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:39,795
- The mission card is gone.
 - The mission card?

1288
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:43,833
(Jin Woong hears them talking.)

1289
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,225
(Finally, our Preys are here.)

1290
00:52:45,225 --> 00:52:46,767
What happened here?

1291
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:47,925
The mission card is gone.

1292
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:52,865
Forget it. Let's get going.

1293
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:55,125
(They head to the basement as the Hunters expected.)

1294
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,295
- Is there another floor below us?
 - I don't know.

1295
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:03,725
(The preparation to hunt...)

1296
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,865
(is complete.)

1297
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:08,150
Is it here?

1298
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,225
I don't know.

1299
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:10,365
It's not here. Let's go.

1300
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:14,495
(They're totally entrapped.)

1301
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:17,025
Look over there.

1302
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:18,895
There are cameras.

1303
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,165
(They're nervous.)

1304
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:24,695
(Hunters are also on alert.)

1305
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:31,665
(The hunt is about to begin.)

1306
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:32,895
They're rats in the trap.

1307
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:34,995
(They're rats in the trap.)

1308
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,265
Gosh.

1309
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:41,395
(You got a phone call.)

1310
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:43,425
Silence! Gosh.

1311
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,760
Hello... What?

1312
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,825
They just went down.

1313
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:48,895
(Whispering)

1314
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,625
- What?
 - They just went to the basement.

1315
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:52,595
What did he say?

1316
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:54,295
Come down.

1317
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:56,765
How do I turn this to vibration mode?

1318
00:53:57,765 --> 00:53:59,795
- Wait.
 - See who's there.

1319
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:06,495
(Come one more step closer to us.)

1320
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:14,165
(Hunters!)

1321
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:22,125
(Their hunt begins.)

1322
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,565
Run. Gosh.

1323
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,195
My goodness! Jin Woong!

1324
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,625
(Jin Woong has been waiting for them.)

1325
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,565
(Where are you going, Jae Seok?)

1326
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:33,665
Where are you going?

1327
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,090
Gosh, Jin Woong. Please.

1328
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,473
Jin Woong, let me go!

1329
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,495
Jae Seok, you know I love you.

1330
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:41,365
- Gosh, please!
 - I love you.

1331
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:44,365
(Jae Seok is caught by Jin Woong.)

1332
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,995
You lost your name tag already?

1333
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:49,856
Hurry!

1334
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:52,195
(Yul also joins the hunt.)

1335
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,425
No way!

1336
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:59,725
(Yul removes Seok Jin's name tag. Seok Jin is out.)

1337
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:01,667
- Hello.
 - Hi.

1338
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,994
It's good to see you.

1339
00:55:02,994 --> 00:55:04,195
Hello.

1340
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:05,765
Kwang Soo is the only one who's left, right?

1341
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:07,095
He ran away.

1342
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:10,795
(Ye Ri chases after Kwang Soo.)

1343
00:55:10,795 --> 00:55:11,865
My goodness.

1344
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:13,495
(Kwang Soo vs Ye Ri)

1345
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:17,443
Kwang Soo, please say hello to me.

1346
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:18,640
Hello!

1347
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,995
Gosh, I can't run any more.

1348
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,456
(Kwang Soo is sprinting.)

1349
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:25,095
Let me just get your name tag.

1350
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:26,695
(Kwang Soo is sprinting.)

1351
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:28,865
Let me just get your name tag.

1352
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:31,125
(Ye Ri doesn't give up on him.)

1353
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:35,095
It's a dead end. It's locked.

1354
00:55:35,095 --> 00:55:36,225
(He is trapped.)

1355
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:38,843
Ye Ri.

1356
00:55:38,843 --> 00:55:39,965
Please listen to me.

1357
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:40,965
(He changes his strategy.)

1358
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,495
I'll give you all the hints I obtained.

1359
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:45,995
Here they are. They have all the information.

1360
00:55:46,395 --> 00:55:48,414
- I'll give you these.
 - Just give me your name tag.

1361
00:55:48,414 --> 00:55:49,895
No. Because...

1362
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,197
- Let me have your name tag.
 - Later.

1363
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:53,765
Listen to me.

1364
00:55:54,165 --> 00:55:55,395
(Peeking)

1365
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:58,265
(He diverts Ye Ri's attention and runs away again)

1366
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,125
Can I go down?

1367
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:02,825
Not that way.

1368
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,825
You're in the women's restroom. Get out now.

1369
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,695
You can't go in there.

1370
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:09,825
Shame on you.

1371
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,095
(Come on out.)

1372
00:56:11,095 --> 00:56:13,317
- You're in the women's restroom.
 - I had no choice.

1373
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:16,187
Please give me your name tag. Just give it to me.

1374
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:17,825
You're nothing but a rat in a trap.

1375
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:19,533
- Wait.
 - Give me your name tag.

1376
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:21,265
- No.
 - Give me your name tag.

1377
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:22,725
- Hold on.
 - Give it to me.

1378
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:24,795
- Give it to me.
 - Wait a minute.

1379
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:26,365
Jin Woong!

1380
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:28,687
Give me your name tag.

1381
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:31,914
(And...)

1382
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:34,825
(he starts running away again.)

1383
00:56:37,195 --> 00:56:41,965
(The second round between Ye Ri and Kwang Soo begins.)

1384
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:47,495
(He has never been this fast before.)

1385
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,695
(Ye Ri also runs at a high speed.)

1386
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:52,865
I can't do it any more.

1387
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:56,595
(Kwang Soo is too fast for Ye Ri.)

1388
00:56:56,595 --> 00:56:59,465
(It was really close.)

1389
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:00,595
My goodness.

1390
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:02,125
Where's everyone?

1391
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:08,295
(Kwang Soo had a narrow escape.)

1392
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:14,730
(He's out of breath.)

1393
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,295
(It was a long and rough escape.)

1394
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:26,465
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok are caught by the Hunters.)

1395
00:57:27,165 --> 00:57:28,825
(Sung Ki is up on the rooftop.)

1396
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:30,365
Kwang Soo came here, right?

1397
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:31,825
(Kwang Soo came here, right?)

1398
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:32,965
(Nodding)

1399
00:57:33,665 --> 00:57:35,125
Let me make a phone call.

1400
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:39,365
Is he up there? Where?

1401
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:40,425
(Jin Woong arrives as well.)

1402
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,225
She said Kwang Soo was here.

1403
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,325
(Kwang Soo is here!)

1404
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:45,465
What?

1405
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:47,295
Ye Ri isn't here.

1406
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:50,425
She said Kwang Soo came here.

1407
00:57:51,495 --> 00:57:53,765
There are about three escape routes here.

1408
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:56,225
(They lost trace of Kwang Soo.)

1409
00:57:56,225 --> 00:57:58,495
She must've mistaken Yul as Kwang Soo.

1410
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:03,165
(Kwang Soo is catching his breath.)

1411
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:04,560
I need to get out of here.

1412
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,797
I need to escape.

1413
00:58:05,797 --> 00:58:06,895
I have to run away now.

1414
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:08,980
(He moves for the next mission before he gets caught.)

1415
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,165
I need to run away from here.

1416
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:12,204
Let's get going.

1417
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:13,314
Let me call Haha.

1418
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:16,287
(He urgently calls Haha.)

1419
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:17,670
- Haha.
 - Yes.

1420
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,465
Jae Seok and Seok Jin are out.

1421
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:23,965
- I see.
 - We should meet.

1422
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,625
We no longer need to wander around.

1423
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,495
Let's meet and share our hints, and go for the final mission.

1424
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:30,925
Okay. Let's share the hints.

1425
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,697
- Where are you?
 - What did you get?

1426
00:58:32,697 --> 00:58:34,565
I promise to share my hints.

1427
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:35,967
I'm having lunch now.

1428
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:38,265
I haven't eaten anything yet. Where are you? I'll go there.

1429
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:40,725
We should hurry.

1430
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:42,995
Okay.

1431
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:45,573
I'm near Samgakji.

1432
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:47,165
Okay. I'll take a taxi, then.

1433
00:58:47,165 --> 00:58:50,100
(They make a deal.)

1434
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,265
Let's...

1435
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,495
stay in the car.

1436
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,104
We'll let him in once he shows us the hints.

1437
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:57,756
If not, he can't come with us.

1438
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:59,625
- I'm sure he's lonely now.
 - Okay, we should do that.

1439
00:59:01,165 --> 00:59:03,895
We should hurry. They might get here before...

1440
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:05,225
- we finish eating.
 - I need to get in a taxi.

1441
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:07,270
Where is he now?

1442
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:09,095
- We can follow his GPS.
 - He's not far...

1443
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:10,617
- from here.
 - All right.

1444
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:13,643
When Kwang Soo passes by,

1445
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:15,395
you can feel it.

1446
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:18,895
He's exactly on Ehwa Intersection.

1447
00:59:18,895 --> 00:59:20,425
- Ehwa Intersection? Over there?
 - Yes.

1448
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,295
I should catch a taxi.

1449
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:27,765
(The GPS locates him precisely. They close in on him.)

1450
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:29,725
Taxi!

1451
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:33,395
(Kwang Soo catches a taxi to meet Haha.)

1452
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:37,294
Hello.

1453
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:38,665
Please go to Samgakji.

1454
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:40,095
- Where?
 - Samgakji, please.

1455
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:41,365
- Samgakji?
 - Yes.

1456
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:44,325
- He can go this way and go up.
 - Right.

1457
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:45,995
- He can go up using this path.
 - Look at the opposite side.

1458
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:47,880
- Someone is running.
 - Where?

1459
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,050
This way or that way?

1460
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,325
- On the left side.
 - The opposite side.

1461
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:51,665
Isn't that person just working out?

1462
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:53,995
I should give up Daehagno.

1463
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:59,665
- They're there!
 - They're right behind us.

1464
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:02,795
Sir, please ditch them. Oh, gosh.

1465
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:07,240
(The Hunters are following Kwang Soo close-by.)

1466
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,025
(Where is Kwang Soo?)

1467
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:10,025
Wait.

1468
01:00:10,025 --> 01:00:11,965
It's them. They got into a taxi.

1469
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:13,995
- Wait.
 - Stop.

1470
01:00:13,995 --> 01:00:15,495
- There.
 - Right there.

1471
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:17,295
- That one.
 - Get off.

1472
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,377
- Get off.
 - No. Wait.

1473
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:21,565
We have to get out. They're at a red light.

1474
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:22,895
They locked the door anyway.

1475
01:00:23,395 --> 01:00:25,125
- They locked the door.
 - They did.

1476
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,495
(The Hunters manage to follow Kwang Soo's taxi.)

1477
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,495
- They locked the door.
 - Follow the car.

1478
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:29,765
- The GPS is very precise.
 - They locked the door.

1479
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:31,225
- They are turning right.
 - They're turning right.

1480
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:32,495
They didn't see us. Or did they?

1481
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,225
- They saw us.
 - They saw us.

1482
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:35,895
(Kwang Soo is close to getting caught.)

1483
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:37,165
How can we meet here? This is crazy.

1484
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:39,225
How can we meet here?

1485
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:41,695
How can we meet here? I even caught a taxi.

1486
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,825
If I got in the next taxi...

1487
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:45,465
(No matter what he does, he has no luck whatsoever.)

1488
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:47,895
- He locked the door.
 - He looked back.

1489
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,563
- You are dead.
 - That's right.

1490
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:54,325
You're dead when you get caught.

1491
01:00:54,765 --> 01:00:56,295
I'm so scared. What do I do?

1492
01:00:57,025 --> 01:00:58,407
Hey.

1493
01:00:58,407 --> 01:00:59,697
Give up what?

1494
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,165
Why are you doing this to me?

1495
01:01:01,165 --> 01:01:02,997
(Gary calls Kwang Soo.)

1496
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:04,795
Kwang Soo, just get off. It's over.

1497
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,625
It's over now, Kwang Soo.

1498
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,107
What will you do? Will you keep going?

1499
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:09,395
I will give you 30 percent of the share.

1500
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:10,765
(He offers 30 percent of the share.)

1501
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:12,125
Please stab Jae Seok's leg.

1502
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:13,795
Jin Woong...

1503
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,725
Jin Woong is just about to open the door.

1504
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,970
- He's ready.
 - Please, Gary.

1505
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:22,225
- I know.
 - There's nothing you can do.

1506
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,465
- Kwang Soo.
 - Jae Seok.

1507
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:25,625
Don't even bother doing that.

1508
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,195
Please. Please stop it.

1509
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,025
- Just surrender.
 - Please leave me alone.

1510
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:34,295
It's like you're on a bike without brakes.

1511
01:01:35,165 --> 01:01:36,467
And you're going downhill, too.

1512
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,495
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1513
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:39,825
You have to surrender now.

1514
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:41,795
You know, Seok Jin and I feel very much at ease.

1515
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,495
Jin Woong and Mr Ahn are very good people.

1516
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:48,095
If I knew it'd feel like this, I would've turned myself in earlier.

1517
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:49,795
I would've surrendered from the very start.

1518
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:52,910
- They will stop here.
 - They did.

1519
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,760
They stopped. We have to get off.

1520
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,725
- This is good.
 - Good. Let's get off.

1521
01:01:58,725 --> 01:01:59,795
- Get off.
 - Please open the door.

1522
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:02,825
- Jae Seok, you stay in the car.
 - I'll stop right next to the car.

1523
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:07,925
(He stays low.)

1524
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:10,160
(Jin Woong the Hunter gets out of the car!)

1525
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,925
Please lock the door!

1526
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,225
Sir! Sir! Please don't open the door.

1527
01:02:15,225 --> 01:02:16,495
If you open the door, I will die.

1528
01:02:17,225 --> 01:02:18,225
If you open the door, I'll die.

1529
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:19,925
(Let's go, Kwang Soo.)

1530
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:21,395
If you open the door, I will die.

1531
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,865
Sir, you can't open the door. Please don't open the door.

1532
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:25,965
Sir, please don't open the door.

1533
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:28,095
I'll report to the police!

1534
01:02:29,065 --> 01:02:30,265
I will report you to the police!

1535
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:34,895
I should run now.

1536
01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:38,467
This is it! Let's make a right!

1537
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,397
Hurry up and please turn right!

1538
01:02:40,397 --> 01:02:41,795
- We might lose him.
 - Hurry up!

1539
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:46,095
(The Hunters start to chase him.)

1540
01:02:46,795 --> 01:02:48,365
Haha, I am running away right now! Please turn right!

1541
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:49,795
Please, Sir!

1542
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:52,125
What?

1543
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,265
(He must be very busy.)

1544
01:02:53,825 --> 01:02:57,725
Sir, please turn right. Just enter anywhere.

1545
01:02:57,725 --> 01:02:59,225
(If he can avoid them, he would go anywhere.)

1546
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,365
Where are we?

1547
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:03,460
Please enter.

1548
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,165
- The last moment was...
 - We were so close.

1549
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:06,495
- Yes.
 - It was so close.

1550
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,714
Right.

1551
01:03:07,714 --> 01:03:09,725
We could've had a beautiful shot. It's too bad.

1552
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:13,240
- Haha. Yes.
 - Hey.

1553
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,165
So did you ditch them?

1554
01:03:15,165 --> 01:03:16,477
I did. I did.

1555
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:17,965
- Are you sure?
 - Yes.

1556
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,697
- He's there.
 - He's still inside.

1557
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,565
- He intentionally came in here.
 - This is good.

1558
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,195
- Did he get off?
 - It looks like he did.

1559
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:27,625
(They are just a few steps away from each other.)

1560
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,765
Please exit, Sir. Please get out.

1561
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:32,495
Haha, I will... I will...

1562
01:03:32,495 --> 01:03:33,495
(The Hunters are here.)

1563
01:03:33,495 --> 01:03:35,056
I will call you again.

1564
01:03:35,056 --> 01:03:36,495
Haha, I will call you again.

1565
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:40,495
(Come here, Kwang Soo.)

1566
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,695
I think I can ditch them. I will call you.

1567
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:47,195
I will call you.

1568
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:50,865
(Do you think you can ditch us?)

1569
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,165
Please, Sir.

1570
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:55,565
(Please don't open the door.)

1571
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,756
You have to escape. Please reverse and...

1572
01:03:57,756 --> 01:03:59,094
- Come on.
 - I...

1573
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:00,495
(The car is totally surrounded.)

1574
01:04:00,495 --> 01:04:03,325
It can be a beautiful shot. Come with me.

1575
01:04:04,365 --> 01:04:07,425
(Is this really the end?)

1576
01:04:07,425 --> 01:04:09,990
Please reverse, Sir. You have to save me.

1577
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,195
Jin Woong!

1578
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:14,195
I am going to meet Haha. Come with me!

1579
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:16,595
I'm going to meet Haha!

1580
01:04:16,595 --> 01:04:18,380
What? I'm going to meet Haha.

1581
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,150
- Where?
 - At Samgakji.

1582
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,225
No.

1583
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:23,195
He's in Yeouido. He's bound to come here.

1584
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:24,365
I know what you're thinking.

1585
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:26,895
He knows this. He knows that he shouldn't come here.

1586
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:31,125
So are you trying to exchange the hints with them?

1587
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:33,825
We're supposed to share them, but first,

1588
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:36,094
I'll take you to Haha.

1589
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:38,495
Haha is calling me right now. We have to catch him anyway.

1590
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:40,965
Sir, please escape when you get an opportunity.

1591
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:42,165
(He's desperate.)

1592
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:43,665
(He's just about to get caught.)

1593
01:04:43,665 --> 01:04:44,765
- Hello?
 - Hey.

1594
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:47,325
- You're caught, aren't you?
 - No, I'm not.

1595
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:50,036
I'm still in the car. The doors are locked.

1596
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:52,053
You're stuck, aren't you?

1597
01:04:52,053 --> 01:04:53,595
The driver is reversing the car.

1598
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:54,995
(The Hunters block Kwang Soo.)

1599
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:56,665
They are just outside the car.

1600
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,325
(Kwang Soo's only hope is to meet Haha.)

1601
01:04:58,325 --> 01:04:59,695
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes, Haha.

1602
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,483
Just give me the hints.

1603
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,595
If I am about to get caught, I will give you the hints.

1604
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,495
We ditched them.

1605
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,025
- Kwang Soo.
 - Please stop. Should I exit?

1606
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:12,425
- I think you should.
 - Should I walk through that door?

1607
01:05:13,795 --> 01:05:15,295
Please pay him.

1608
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,097
(He finds an exit.)

1609
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:19,125
Please reverse a little bit.

1610
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,795
(He has to sneak out without getting caught.)

1611
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:24,225
(What is he doing?)

1612
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:25,725
I have to go out that way.

1613
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:30,565
(He uses the opportunity and runs.)

1614
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:36,995
(It's amazing that he found this path.)

1615
01:05:38,495 --> 01:05:40,800
He's running away! He's going up!

1616
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,995
He's going up!

1617
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:48,265
- He's going up! Up!
 - Up.

1618
01:05:48,265 --> 01:05:52,695
(The Hunters are caught off guard.)

1619
01:06:00,095 --> 01:06:02,925
(He has to get out alive.)

1620
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:06,465
(Jae Seok the Hunter dashes upstairs in a flash.)

1621
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:07,733
I don't know where he is.

1622
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:08,925
There he is!

1623
01:06:10,495 --> 01:06:11,665
(Breathing heavily)

1624
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:14,925
(Kwang Soo's self-recorded footage)

1625
01:06:15,965 --> 01:06:19,265
(Jae Seok gets close, but he misses Kwang Soo.)

1626
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:23,425
(Sprinting)

1627
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:27,395
(Kwang Soo ditches his camera and runs away alone.)

1628
01:06:29,495 --> 01:06:33,725
(The panting of the Prey and the Hunter fills the street.)

1629
01:06:36,895 --> 01:06:43,065
(He lost Kwang Soo in a busy street.)

1630
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:46,065
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is one step behind.)

1631
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:47,765
Oh gosh, it's Jae Seok!

1632
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:52,895
(He's running with all his might.)

1633
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,495
(Jin Woong the Hunter is slightly worn-off, but he still runs.)

1634
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:58,970
(Panting)

1635
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,225
Where did he go?

1636
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,346
(Seok Jin has no intention of running.)

1637
01:07:02,346 --> 01:07:03,795
Did Kwang Soo go this way?

1638
01:07:04,365 --> 01:07:05,495
I see. Thank you.

1639
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,883
He's desperate, so he runs well.

1640
01:07:08,883 --> 01:07:11,340
- He's desperate, so he runs.
 - It's because...

1641
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,565
he got out of the parking lot and went around the hill.

1642
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,477
He went out like this.

1643
01:07:15,477 --> 01:07:18,925
- The hill was very long.
 - I know.

1644
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:20,495
Did he go this way or that way?

1645
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:24,195
- This is...
 - Now the GPS is useless.

1646
01:07:24,195 --> 01:07:25,295
It is useless.

1647
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:27,225
- Where?
 - It's not here.

1648
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:29,125
The GPS is with the cameraman.

1649
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:31,325
We no longer have the GPS.

1650
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:34,025
We should tell Mr Ahn and use...

1651
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:37,395
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry, but you are done for.

1652
01:07:37,395 --> 01:07:38,825
(Kwang Soo escapes to an abandoned building.)

1653
01:07:38,825 --> 01:07:39,865
Kwang Soo, say it.

1654
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:42,425
Haha.

1655
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:43,865
Kwang Soo, you're done for.

1656
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:45,825
I got out.

1657
01:07:47,595 --> 01:07:48,695
(Really?)

1658
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:49,846
Haha.

1659
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:52,425
(You're something, Kwang Soo.)

1660
01:07:52,425 --> 01:07:53,495
Haha.

1661
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:57,365
- Haha.
 - Yes. Talk to me.

1662
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,765
- Say your last words.
 - I'm dying.

1663
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,765
I ran with just one camera.

1664
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:03,825
There's no cameraman.

1665
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:06,165
- There's no cameraman with you?
 - Right now...

1666
01:08:07,565 --> 01:08:09,060
I'm inside some abandoned building.

1667
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,394
You're in an abandoned building?

1668
01:08:10,394 --> 01:08:11,765
(Gasping)

1669
01:08:12,165 --> 01:08:14,895
I will go to save you, but I think you're done for.

1670
01:08:16,165 --> 01:08:17,414
So tell me quickly.

1671
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:18,565
Tell me quickly.

1672
01:08:18,565 --> 01:08:20,865
We will find the prize and give you a share of it.

1673
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,695
Haha, that's not it.

1674
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:25,425
(What is it?)

1675
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:26,635
Nobody knows that I am here.

1676
01:08:27,225 --> 01:08:28,395
I won't get caught.

1677
01:08:28,765 --> 01:08:29,925
I couldn't get caught.

1678
01:08:30,665 --> 01:08:32,595
Tell me about the Hongje-dong hint. What is it?

1679
01:08:32,595 --> 01:08:34,225
(Haha's only interest is Kwang Soo's hint.)

1680
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:35,795
Can't we meet up first? Can't we do it together?

1681
01:08:35,795 --> 01:08:37,956
(Kwang Soo is desperate.)

1682
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:39,397
Please take me in.

1683
01:08:39,397 --> 01:08:40,895
- You must be really lonely.
 - Haha.

1684
01:08:41,425 --> 01:08:42,635
I've been alone the whole time.

1685
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:45,425
- Okay.
 - I'll go to the War Memorial.

1686
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:46,795
- Okay. Bye.
 - Okay.

1687
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:47,925
(They decide to meet at the War Memorial.)

1688
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,747
(It's tense.)

1689
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:55,265
It sounds like he really went inside an abandoned building.

1690
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:57,495
(Haha and Ji Hyo are very relaxed.)

1691
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:59,595
Haha, we have to make a wise decision.

1692
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:02,025
Will we go to save Kwang Soo and die together?

1693
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:05,495
(Will they risk the danger and save Kwang Soo?)

1694
01:09:05,495 --> 01:09:07,391
Or will we abandon him and go find the hint ourselves?

1695
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:08,880
Sir, is Hongje-dong far from here?

1696
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,395
- No, but you must decide quickly.
 - Okay.

1697
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:13,095
Then please head to Hongje-dong.

1698
01:09:13,865 --> 01:09:16,325
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1699
01:09:18,465 --> 01:09:21,365
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo knows nothing about what's going on.)

1700
01:09:22,095 --> 01:09:24,725
Viewers, please give me some strength.

1701
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:27,760
Justice always wins in the end.

1702
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,595
So please give me strength, everyone.

1703
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:34,165
(He runs away while making a fuss.)

1704
01:09:35,825 --> 01:09:42,387
(He runs through narrow alleys, reaches a major road...)

1705
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:48,465
(and dramatically catches a taxi.)

1706
01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:54,425
(Friends, wait for me. I'm coming.)

1707
01:09:56,495 --> 01:09:58,595
What should I do? What should I do now?

1708
01:09:58,595 --> 01:10:00,395
(He spots Jin Woong.)

1709
01:10:00,395 --> 01:10:02,965
Who is that? It's Jin Woong.

1710
01:10:04,135 --> 01:10:05,635
It's Uncle Jin Woong!

1711
01:10:06,395 --> 01:10:07,565
(Oh my goodness.)

1712
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:10,636
You're right. I'm old enough to be your uncle.

1713
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:11,894
Goodness.

1714
01:10:11,894 --> 01:10:15,595
How can you make an uncle run like this, Kwang Soo?

1715
01:10:18,395 --> 01:10:19,565
He's right in front of me.

1716
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:20,995
(I can't be caught like this.)

1717
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:22,495
He's right next to me now.

1718
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:26,165
(I can't lose you like this.)

1719
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,095
Hello, everyone. It's Kwang Soo here.

1720
01:10:29,965 --> 01:10:32,695
I'm holding a camera in my hand right now,

1721
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:36,135
but I'm not sure if this camera is working properly,

1722
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:39,765
so I'm leaving a short video clip like this.

1723
01:10:41,165 --> 01:10:44,895
I'm not with the cameraman any more.

1724
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:48,325
I barely survived by myself alone.

1725
01:10:52,865 --> 01:10:54,395
Should I keep recording this video? What should I do?

1726
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:58,495
(The hunt is not over yet.)

1727
01:10:59,365 --> 01:11:02,587
(Hunt down the traitor that tricked everyone!)

1728
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:05,987
(Escape from the Prey's grasp.)

1729
01:11:05,987 --> 01:11:07,495
(The secret of the chase is revealed.)

1730
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:11,653
(July of 1953. The clue for the chase is revealed.)

1731
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:14,325
(Kwang Soo knows the secrets.)

1732
01:11:14,325 --> 01:11:16,365
(The close to an unending chase)

1733
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:22,830
Nobody knows that I'm here. I won't be caught.

1734
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,265
It's impossible.

1735
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:28,025
(What will be the fate of the Preys?)

1736
01:11:28,025 --> 01:11:31,365
(The women of fate are coming.)

1737
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:36,350
(Next week, these beautiful men and women will please your eyes.)

1738
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,165
(Park Shin Hye)

1739
01:11:39,825 --> 01:11:42,065
(Lee Sung Kyoung)

1740
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,135
(Kim Min Seok and Yoon Gyun Sang)

1741
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:49,825
(Oh, My Queen!)
