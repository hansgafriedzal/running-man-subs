1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,870
What's all this?

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,170
(We've invited beautiful actresses for this summer special.)

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,860
(Beautiful Queen Park Shin Hye)

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,010
Oh, my. Look at her.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,840
(Lovely Queen Lee Sung Kyoung)

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,840
(Soon, these three queens will compete fiercely.)

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,110
Previously on Running Man.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,930
(Last Week)

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,240
(Running Man vs Hunters)

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,310
(The 7 members became Preys last week.)

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,440
I need to get out of here.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,560
(Mysterious Hunters...)

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,470
(and the Preys who failed to resist temptation...)

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,610
(A vault is hidden somewhere in Seoul.)

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,340
(Become the owner of 7,000 dollars!)

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,970
(The Hunters are after the Preys.)

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,110
(Experienced Running Man members vs the Special 4 Hunters)

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,730
Start the car now!

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,570
(Hunters' only goal is to catch the members.)

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,540
(Will the members obtain 7,000 dollars or will they be caught?)

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,610
No way.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,020
(Four are arrested and the survivors haven't earned full hints yet.)

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,470
(There are only three Preys left.)

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,570
(Clever Haha, Speedy Kwang Soo and Talented Ji Hyo)

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,010
(Who will be the one to come out on top?)

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,880
Please get ready to be caught.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,170
(6 hours since the run)

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,470
(Kwang Soo is on his way to meet Haha.)

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,340
(He hurriedly grabs a taxi.)

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,940
Hello. Please take me to the War Memorial.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,170
(What?)

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,010
(Jin Woong is right next to Kwang Soo, looking for him.)

33
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,640
Look! It's Uncle Jin Woong!

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,610
(Goodness.)

35
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,970
Right, I'm old enough to be your uncle.

36
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,540
Kwang Soo, you're making this old man run after you like this.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,270
He's right there.

38
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,340
(I can't get caught like this.)

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,440
Please.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,850
(I can't get caught like this.)

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,180
He's right next to us.

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,940
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes?

43
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,400
There's someone here...

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,490
who wants to talk to you. He has something to say.

45
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,740
- Who?
 - Talk to him.

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,280
Kwang Soo, this is Sung Ki.

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Hello, Sir.

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,170
Kwang Soo.

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,910
(What will be the head Hunter's ultimatum to Kwang Soo?)

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,570
(Will he say that he'll catch Kwang Soo or save his life?)

51
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,070
- Hello, Sir.
 - Aren't you thirsty?

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,210
- I'm okay.
 - You must be hungry, too.

53
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,840
(Aren't you thirsty and hungry?)

54
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,360
(Is this an ultimatum?)

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,510
Yes, Sir.

56
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,780
Let's meet and have some cold beer together.

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,710
Well, Sir...

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,710
(Sung Ki's sweet-talking.)

59
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,920
Actually, I'm being chased at the moment.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,310
I think...

61
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,440
you should prepare to get caught nicely.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,670
- So let's call it a day quickly...
 - Okay.

63
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,140
and have some drinks together.

64
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,410
Sir, Haha is in Samgakji right now.

65
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,610
(Kwang Soo betrays Haha.)

66
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,170
He's having lunch in Samgakji.

67
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,970
Then, get ready to be caught heroically soon.

68
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,640
- Yes, Sir.
 - I'll count on you.

69
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,150
That was really nice.

70
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,730
- I think it will make him hesitate.
 - Right.

71
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm sure he will hesitate.

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,670
(His eyes tremble in hesitation.)

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,970
(He starts running with contemplation.)

74
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,230
I'm in front of Changdeokgung.

75
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,240
Okay.

76
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,610
Good. I'm right next to Doldam-gil.

77
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,910
(Kwang Soo decides to meet Haha.)

78
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm on my way to Haha now.

79
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,970
(He's on his way to meet Haha.)

80
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,610
He says he's nearby.

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,570
(Haha is on his way to Kwang Soo by taxi.)

82
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,560
- Hello.
 - Kwang Soo, I think...

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,810
Oh, there you are. I can see you.

84
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,410
Get in. Get in.

85
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,810
(He sees Kwang Soo and stops the taxi.)

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,810
Okay.

87
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,550
- Hey.
 - What should we do?

88
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,910
- Gosh.
 - This is driving me crazy.

89
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,220
It's so nice to see you again. I'm so exhausted right now.

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,870
If we go this way, we can catch him.

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,140
- Who?
 - Haha.

92
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,670
- Do you mean this way?
 - Yes.

93
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,180
- This building must be there.
 - There are cameras.

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,110
- Hold on, is it this way?
 - That way.

95
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,170
Let's go.

96
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,470
(Haha and Kwang Soo head to Daehangno for hints.)

97
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,670
We must watch out here.

98
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,230
We should go that way.

99
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,970
- Where?
 - Down that way.

100
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,240
(Ji Hyo arrives at Daehangno after obtaining hints at Ant Village.)

101
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
- Do you know where Art Council is?
 - It's not this way.

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,610
- Really?
 - You have to turn left.

103
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,640
Left?

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,970
- So are we not alone?
 - We're in trouble.

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,770
Ji Hyo, hurry up!

106
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,420
You called me, right?

107
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,270
Then one of us must be on the lookout.

108
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,170
Why don't you two go? I'll look out for you.

109
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,340
- Then I'll go with Kwang Soo.
 - Okay. Stand guard.

110
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,130
All right. Let's go find them.

111
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,240
I don't know where we're heading. But let's give it a shot.

112
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,040
Haha's at Marronnier Park now.

113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,740
- So it's near Dongseong street.
 - Now...

114
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,540
I think we should go that way.

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,510
- We should...
 - We must hurry now.

116
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,440
Wow. They have surveillance cameras everywhere.

117
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,970
(Haha uses surveillance monitors for a perfect lookout.)

118
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,820
I think they found something. They're coming up.

119
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,120
Will they share the hints?

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,510
- They look the same.
 - Kwang Soo,

121
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,010
we have to find the differences in these pictures.

122
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
"Press the button next to the window."

123
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,530
Window? Where is it?

124
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,880
- Now, Haha is...
 - He's trying to survive.

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,210
not with them.

126
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,410
I think he's staking out.

127
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,760
- Do you mean Haha?
 - Yes, in Daehangno.

128
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,010
And Kwang Soo is with Ji Hyo.

129
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,110
Where are you, Haha?

130
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,140
Why are you two not coming up?

131
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,940
Haha, you have to open the door in the basement for us.

132
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,870
- Do I have to open the door?
 - Yes.

133
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,740
Ji Hyo, I have a bad feeling.

134
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,010
(I don't feel good about this.)

135
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,040
Oh, I found it.

136
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,170
One, two, three, four, five.

137
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,770
I need to find two more.

138
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,010
- This is driving me crazy.
 - There are so many people here.

139
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,640
The atmosphere's very strange here.

140
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,440
Haha.

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,740
Calm down, Ji Hyo. Take your time. You can do it.

142
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Haha,

143
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,210
- switch positions with Kwang Soo.
 - I think they're coming in.

144
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,240
What?

145
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,670
They're here?

146
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,310
Find it now, Ji Hyo!

147
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,780
I can't!

148
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,970
Find it!

149
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,810
I found it!

150
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,110
(Ji Hyo finally finds all the passwords.)

151
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,310
(Haha discovers something.)

152
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,370
(They're here.)

153
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,660
Gosh, they're here!

154
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,710
They are here!

155
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,770
They're here!

156
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,840
(Ji Hyo starts running away, leaving Kwang Soo behind.)

157
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,370
(Tall Kwang Soo tries to climb over the wall.)

158
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,740
(Will they be able to successfully escape from the Hunters?)

159
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,040
Go get them! Catch them!

160
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,710
Where are they? Where?

161
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,940
(They're running in the middle of Daehangno.)

162
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,650
(Haha, don't make this chase more complicated.)

163
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,340
(Jae Seok is running after Haha.)

164
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,610
- Jae Seok!
 - Come here.

165
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,460
(Jae Seok sucessfully corners Haha.)

166
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,810
(There's no way to escape.)

167
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,110
Gary, go catch Kwang Soo.

168
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,410
Kwang Soo, run!

169
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,610
Come here.

170
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,860
- There you are, Jin Woong.
 - Jin Woong, rip his name tag.

171
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,910
My goodness.

172
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,170
- There you are.
 - Hello, Jin Woong.

173
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,670
You're here, Jin Woong.

174
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,870
(Nice to meet you, Prey.)

175
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,570
(I got you, Haha.)

176
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,640
Rip his name tag off.

177
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,810
(Ripping)

178
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,340
Come over here, Haha.

179
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,740
Come here.

180
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,310
- Let's go catch Kwang Soo.
 - No way!

181
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,440
Haha, where's Kwang Soo?

182
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,430
(The Hunters are now after Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.)

183
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,170
(Hunters arrest Haha.)

184
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,670
(Ji Hyo barely escapes the building with the password for the vault.)

185
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,270
Sit down. Let's talk first.

186
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,070
Let's sit down here.

187
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
We should...

188
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,540
(Ji Hyo obtained all the hints and the password.)

189
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,670
There's information here.

190
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,840
Yeonhui Hill was a battlefield of the Korean War.

191
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,840
There was a battle here. I found the information.

192
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,240
Ji Hyo!

193
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,810
(No one answers back in the silence.)

194
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,810
Ji Hyo.

195
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,470
(Quiet)

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,370
(He's nothing but a rat in a trap without others' help from outside.)

197
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,430
Haha.

198
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,910
(There's no one here, either.)

199
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,270
(Haha... Ji Hyo... Please, anyone...)

200
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,140
Let's be together until the end.

201
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,340
(Us three must survive and find the vault together.)

202
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,090
- Kwang Soo!
 - Ji Hyo!

203
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,910
(You're on your way to save me, right?)

204
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,570
(We're here for you.)

205
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,310
- Why did you do that?
 - Hello.

206
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,470
- Kwang Soo.
 - How do we open the door?

207
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,610
My goodness.

208
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,710
- How could you...
 - Hold on.

209
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
No way! Why are you here?

210
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,440
- You...
 - Wait.

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,110
- Sit down. Sit down.
 - Wait.

212
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,310
(Yul removes Kwang Soo's name tag.)

213
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,660
- Sit down.
 - No!

214
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,710
How could you do that to me?

215
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,910
Did you get Haha, too?

216
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,610
- We finally caught Kwang Soo.
 - Gosh, I was almost done!

217
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,260
- It was a long day, right?
 - Right.

218
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,310
You're so inconsiderate.

219
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,370
- You shouldn't do that.
 - Wait...

220
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,950
You shouldn't have done that to the taxi driver.

221
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,970
How could you?

222
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,010
I am sorry.

223
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,110
(We'd like to thank the taxi driver for driving him around.)

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,350
- Let's go catch Ji Hyo!
 - Did you not see her?

225
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,660
- Ji Hyo just went up!
 - Let's go.

226
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,710
- Let's get going.
 - Goodness.

227
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,050
(Let's go get Ji Hyo. She has all the hints.)

228
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,160
(Kwang soo is out, too. Ji Hyo is the only one left.)

229
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,340
(Ji Hyo heads to the vault.)

230
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Sir, please go to Yeonhui Hill.

231
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,070
(Meanwhile, the Hunters are chasing after Ji Hyo.)

232
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,410
Ji Hyo is the only one who got the hint at Miari Ridge.

233
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,240
(They must catch Ji Hyo before she gets to the vault.)

234
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,040
- Ji Hyo is the most dangerous one.
 - It's her.

235
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,030
Look at this.

236
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,570
I just looked it up on the internet.

237
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,110
It says there's a Memorial monument of Hill 104 there.

238
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,540
Is this the right place?

239
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,410
(She arrives at Yeonhui Hill after almost 8 hours of running.)

240
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,510
Oh, I'm finally here.

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,880
This is the right place.

242
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,870
It says "Memorial monument of Hill 104".

243
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,040
(I should hurry.)

244
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,210
I found it.

245
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,740
(She finds the right place with the hints she obtained.)

246
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,310
What?

247
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,870
(She's about to garner 7,000 dollars.)

248
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,930
(The vault is right before her.)

249
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,010
(She has been running all day for this.)

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,490
(Will Ji Hyo be able to grab 7,000 dollars?)

251
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,940
- My goodness.
 - Well done so far.

252
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,410
(Hello. Nicely done, Ji Hyo.)

253
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,180
- Poor Ji Hyo.
 - How?

254
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,570
We waited for you for a long time.

255
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,810
- We waited the whole day.
 - I knew you'd be waiting here.

256
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,040
- What's that building? A hospital?
 - This man is on crutches.

257
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,470
Isn't it Marronnier Park?

258
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,870
- It's near Daehangno, isn't it?
 - Yes.

259
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,540
Somewhere related to the Korean War.

260
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,970
Isn't it Yeonhui Hill?

261
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,710
- It looks like it.
 - It really does.

262
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,770
This must be the place. Yeonhui Hill.

263
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,710
- Hello.
 - Have you found the place?

264
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,910
I just arrived at Miari Ridge. Oh, goodness.

265
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,270
They said we should go underneath Hangang Bridge.

266
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,500
All right. I saw it.

267
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,840
- It's 53.
 - The answer is 53.

268
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,210
- This is the building. Right there.
 - I think they're there.

269
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,830
We're at the right spot.

270
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,960
- My goodness! Jin Woong!
 - Where are you going?

271
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,210
Where are you going?

272
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,340
You're right! It's Hongje-dong.

273
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,670
Sorry, do you know Mr Kim Jae Pyung living in the village?

274
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,340
I found it. Memorial monument of Hill 104.

275
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,540
I found it.

276
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,110
- Isn't it referring to year 1953?
 - Isn't it 1907?

277
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,010
Did something special happen in 1907?

278
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,380
Look.

279
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,170
- It must have been in the 1950s.
 - Right.

280
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,970
- So it's 1953, in July.
 - In July.

281
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,910
- It's the Korean Armistice Day.
 - Yes. It's the Armistice Day.

282
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,310
- In 1953.
 - It's the Armistice Day.

283
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,970
(They successfully open the vault.)

284
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,540
It's my father's birthday, too.

285
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,770
What's inside?

286
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,610
- Look.
 - There's something inside.

287
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,410
- Are these for us? One each?
 - Yes.

288
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,470
- They're the Golden Badges.
 - Thank you.

289
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,770
- Thank you.
 - Congratulations.

290
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,810
The R mark in the centre is made of real gold.

291
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,010
- So the exterior is fake.
 - Yes. You can detach it, too.

292
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,670
I'll cut off the parts when I get back home.

293
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,950
At home?

294
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,660
You should keep it as a token of remembrance.

295
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,300
Anyway, thank you everyone for joining us today.

296
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,640
(We'd like to thank all of the guests for joining us.)

297
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,170
- It was tough.
 - Good job everyone.

298
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,370
Well done.

299
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,140
(There are 48 days left until the Rio 2016 Olympics.)

300
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,440
(Korea National Training Center)

301
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,770
- Well done.
 - It's summer already.

302
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,170
It's summer already. It's so hot.

303
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,870
- Did you see the preview for today?
 - Yes, I did.

304
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,070
- Shin Hye will join us today.
 - It came out in the preview.

305
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,540
- Call her by her full name.
 - You should do that, not me.

306
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,510
- I'll keep calling her comfortably.
 - Does everyone want to know...

307
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,040
- today's guest?
 - No, we've watched the preview.

308
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,010
He tried to court Sung Kyoung last time,

309
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,970
- but it didn't go well.
 - No, I didn't!

310
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,670
- He tried to.
 - We're like family now.

311
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,370
He approached Hyun Jin and Sung Kyoung last time.

312
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,210
- Yes. That's right.
 - You approached Hyun Jin as well.

313
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,330
- That's not true.
 - It's really strange though.

314
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,340
All the women who was approached by Kwang Soo and turned him down...

315
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,770
- become really famous.
 - That's right.

316
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,740
- That's so true.
 - It's not true!

317
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,940
- That's true.
 - Think of Hyun Jin.

318
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,710
- Sung Kyoung and I are friends!
 - That sounds reasonable.

319
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,710
- No way.
 - They all became stars.

320
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,770
- That's right.
 - Do you agree with me?

321
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,310
You should never go out with Kwang Soo.

322
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,010
Why is everyone doing this?

323
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,370
(Just have fun, but don't go out with him.)

324
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,030
I know everyone is curious to know about today's guests.

325
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,040
- We already know.
 - You revealed them all already.

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,110
So I'll introduce them now.

327
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,110
They are actually standing over there right now.

328
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,140
Who are they?

329
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,510
(Two handsome men approach them.)

330
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,300
- It's Gyun Sang.
 - From "Descendants of the Sun".

331
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,870
- Good to see you, Gyun Sang!
 - Welcome.

332
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,710
(Yoon Gyun Sang and Kim Min Seok)

333
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,540
(Yoon Gyun Sang acted in the drama "Six Flying Dragons".)

334
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,710
I'm Moo Hyul, a warrior!

335
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,870
(Kim Min Seok acted in the drama "Descendants of the Sun".)

336
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,810
Hello. My name is Gyun Sang...

337
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,640
and I'll be acting in the drama "Doctors". Good to see you.

338
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,210
Last time, he acted as a warrior named "Moo Hyul".

339
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,510
- In the drama "Six Flying Dragons".
 - Will you be a doctor this time?

340
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,910
Hello. I'm Min Seok. I'll be acting in "Doctors" as well.

341
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,540
Min Seok will play the role of Kwang Soo.

342
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,260
I'll introduce the queens who are joining us today.

343
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,040
(Finally, the queens are here.)

344
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,210
(Ji Hyo looks beautiful in a white dress today.)

345
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,810
(He's stunned.)

346
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,970
- Ji Hyo.
 - Ji Hyo looks...

347
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,940
really pretty in a dress like this.

348
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,970
She often dresses up properly like this.

349
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,370
Ji Hyo is dressed up today.

350
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,010
- My gosh. You're pretty.
 - You look Vietnamese.

351
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,270
- You look pretty today.
 - You're dressed up today.

352
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,970
- You look really pretty today.
 - Hello.

353
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,330
- Hi.
 - You look so pretty.

354
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,570
(They are surprised.)

355
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,970
Who's next?

356
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,170
(Who is the second queen?)

357
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,170
(She's so charming that you may fall in love with her at first sight.)

358
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,770
- Welcome.
 - She's Sung Kyoung.

359
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,370
(Lee Sung Kyoung)

360
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,010
She hasn't changed at all.

361
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,570
- She's the daughter of Running Man.
 - Right.

362
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,310
Everything went well for her after joining us last time.

363
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,640
Here comes the next queen.

364
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,570
(Wow. They can't help but exclaim.)

365
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,340
(Her smile is as bright as the sun.)

366
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
- Wow.
 - It's Shin Hye this time.

367
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,070
(Park Shin Hye)

368
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,710
- Hello.
 - The dancing machine is here.

369
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,740
Nice to see you, Shin Hye.

370
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,040
- Good to see you.
 - They are both here.

371
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,070
(He can't hide his smile.)

372
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,110
- They are pretty.
 - Wow. They are all..

373
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,210
- beautiful today.
 - Today, these women...

374
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,310
These queens will join us today. Park Shin Hye and Lee Sung Kyoung!

375
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,340
(They're today's two beautiful queens.)

376
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
Also,

377
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,840
Min Seok and Gyun Sang has also joined us!

378
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,740
(The queens' bodyguards, Min Seok and Gyun Sang)

379
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,310
- Wow, he's tall.
 - He really is.

380
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,040
Both of you look so handsome.

381
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,340
The title for today's race is "Oh, My Queen!".

382
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,540
A few minutes ago, the three queens...

383
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,510
picked one rose each...

384
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,440
to see which one of them is the real queen.

385
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,110
Only one of them is the real queen,

386
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,370
and the other two are fake queens.

387
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,690
Really?

388
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,810
The queen who wins the game in the end will receive a diamond tiara.

389
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,000
This is what the male members have to do today.

390
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,870
You need to find the real queen and make her victorious today.

391
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,200
I see.

392
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,080
A hint about the real queen will be revealed after each mission,

393
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,910
so you must gather the hints and decide in the end.

394
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,340
But if a fake queen wins the race,

395
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,510
you will be flogged.

396
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,010
- Goodness.
 - Flogged?

397
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,010
This is crazy.

398
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,910
You will receive a hint...

399
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,010
about who the real queen is at the end of each mission from now on.

400
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,990
- So watch them closely.
 - We got it.

401
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,590
First, we'll make three teams.

402
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,570
We must choose which queen we think is the real one.

403
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,170
- Can we change our decision later?
 - Let's begin.

404
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,540
- All right.
 - Let's go.

405
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,910
(They may find hints while the queens dance.)

406
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,600
How should I do this?

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,710
(The dance battle among the queens)

408
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,880
I'm not sure who it is yet.

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,740
(Let's begin, Queens!)

410
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,970
- Look.
 - I don't have any ideas yet.

411
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,710
I think Ji Hyo is the real queen.

412
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,940
- Do you think it's Ji Hyo? Really?
 - Yes, I think it's her.

413
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,280
- Ji Hyo? Is it really you?
 - We can change our decisions later.

414
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,340
- Really?
 - I feel like it's Ji Hyo.

415
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,010
- Can we really change our choices?
 - She's dancing really hard.

416
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,310
(They dance hard to attract more members to their team.)

417
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,570
(And this man seems so happy as well.)

418
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,110
Sung Kyoung dances well.

419
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,640
Look at Jae Seok's face. What's wrong with him?

420
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,440
- Hey, look.
 - He's really scary.

421
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,090
(Jae Seok is really excited.)

422
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,640
- He's so annoying.
 - He is.

423
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,940
(What was that dance move?)

424
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,770
We can't have too many people in a team.

425
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,620
- I feel like it's Ji Hyo.
 - I think so, too.

426
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,210
Ji Hyo is dancing really hard.

427
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,440
I really think it's her.

428
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,830
You must keep moving.

429
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:31,390
All right. In 5, 4, 3, 2...

430
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,510
How will it turn out?

431
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,040
One!

432
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,140
I really think it's Sung Kyoung.

433
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,210
All right.

434
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,630
(Ji Hyo)

435
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,440
One, two...

436
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,170
(Sung Kyoung, Shin Hye)

437
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,510
Three.

438
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,880
(Who did the men choose as the real queen?)

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,940
Three.

440
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,570
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Park Shin Hye!

441
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,380
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

442
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,210
- Lee Sung Kyoung!
 - Song Ji Hyo!

443
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,040
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

444
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,120
All right. You chose your teams.

445
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,140
Now, we will give you a hint about who the real queen is.

446
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,770
It's related to the dance battle we just had.

447
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,330
- A hint?
 - What does he mean?

448
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,410
- About their dances?
 - There must be a hint...

449
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,770
- about their dancing.
 - Among their dances.

450
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,860
The real queen was...

451
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,220
the last person who stopped dancing.

452
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340
She was the last.

453
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,770
- Really?
 - No. Shin Hye was the last.

454
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,940
- I'm not so sure.
 - I didn't see them in the end.

455
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,410
- Wasn't Shin Hye the last?
 - You're right!

456
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,810
(You shouldn't let your guard down. Make good use of the given hints.)

457
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,040
(Ji Hyo, Sung Kyoung and Shin Hye. Who is the real queen?)

458
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,710
(Team Shin Hye, Team Sung Kyoung and Team Ji Hyo)

459
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,690
Queens, please get on a palanquin.

460
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,380
- Two members will carry it.
 - And one will fan her.

461
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,640
More importantly, there is a big difference in their height.

462
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,870
Have a sip, Your Highness.

463
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,210
- Don't hold me back.
 - Isn't that too much?

464
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,840
Doesn't it feel nice to be treated like this, Shin Hye?

465
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,810
- It feels nice.
 - It's nice.

466
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,940
- Can I have some strong wind?
 - Of course, you can.

467
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,560
(I can make it a lot stronger if you want.)

468
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,210
Is this how things will go today?

469
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,140
- Shall we go?
 - The tag says "Queen Sung Kyoung".

470
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,040
- She's "Queen Shin Hye".
 - If you take a letter out of here,

471
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,640
it will change the meaning completely.

472
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,970
- Hey, Shin Hye!
 - Shin Hye.

473
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,830
Go, Haha. I should've lost some weight before I came.

474
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,100
- How did people do all of this?
 - Do you feel cool, My Queen?

475
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,510
- Actually, it feels nice.
 - Please fan me, too.

476
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,910
It's nice to be able to fan Shin Hye.

477
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,070
- Anyway...
 - We're almost there.

478
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,140
(They arrive at an outdoor pool near the Training Center.)

479
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,380
- My goodness.
 - Should we run there?

480
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,570
- What is that?
 - I guess we need to run over that.

481
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
(The queens give sunscreen to the members.)

482
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,710
You're so kind.

483
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,440
You're kind. No wonder.

484
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,120
Put it on your ears.

485
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,940
You should put sunscreen on your nose and cheeks. Like this.

486
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Put it behind your neck.

487
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,820
- You must put on sunscreen.
 - Your neck, too.

488
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,570
(Seok Jin rides a buoy to get to the centre of the pool.)

489
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,690
- Don't do it. Just don't.
 - Wait.

490
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,040
You must jump over to that side.

491
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,170
Don't! I'll just jump!

492
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,400
(Lifting)

493
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,710
(He falls into the water.)

494
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,070
(Seok Jin starts off by getting soaked.)

495
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,510
- Why did you do that?
 - Why?

496
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,710
This game is called "Carry Your Queen".

497
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,770
The guys from each team will piggyback the opponents' queens.

498
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,810
The opponent?

499
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,210
You'll piggyback the opponents' queens...

500
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,840
and run on the track. Then, you'll pass the queen to the next player.

501
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,470
It'll be a relay...

502
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,170
and you must finish the race before the other team to win.

503
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,750
(You must come in before the other team to win.)

504
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,380
And as you can see,

505
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,470
there are toy hammers and other tools on the side.

506
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,540
The queens can pick one and use it to disturb the other team members.

507
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,210
- I see.
 - That's what they were for.

508
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,840
(Team Ji Hyo moves on since they've already won a game.)

509
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,270
What's the white one?

510
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,380
(Running Man members are known for cheating.)

511
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,610
You can hit their faces.

512
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,110
This one's good, too.

513
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,840
This one is good, too.

514
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,810
The sprayer is the best.

515
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,210
You can spray it in their eyes.

516
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,740
Can I spray it in their noses?

517
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,170
- This is enough.
 - No, she needs something more.

518
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,030
Which team would be better for us?

519
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,940
(These rookies are scared.)

520
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,970
Ready!

521
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,540
- Let's get started.
 - Ready!

522
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,610
She's giving me an arm bar!

523
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,540
- What's this? She's already aiming.
 - Ready.

524
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,710
(The 2nd runners fight amongst themselves.)

525
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,770
(They have started their own game.)

526
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,110
Let's get ready, everybody.

527
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,910
(The 1st runners get ready.)

528
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,740
(We can't lose.)

529
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,880
(We must let our queen take the win.)

530
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,610
(This looks interesting.)

531
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,170
(These women are intense!)

532
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,710
(The game starts!)

533
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,510
(Spraying)

534
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,740
(Pouring)

535
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,210
(They start attacking as soon as the match starts.)

536
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,510
(Struggling)

537
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,910
(They fall into the water.)

538
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,770
(Queen Shin Hye's tactic works!)

539
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,840
(Nice one, Queen Shin Hye.)

540
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,840
(She shoots water into his nose...)

541
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,910
(and wriggles her feet.)

542
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,440
(Seok Jin collapses.)

543
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,670
(Kwang Soo is proud of her.)

544
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,070
(These queens are no joke.)

545
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,940
- Stand up.
 - Stand up!

546
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
(Shaking)

547
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,470
Why aren't you coming?

548
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,060
(He crawls instead of walking.)

549
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,440
(She draws on his face with a lipstick.)

550
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
(Is this a rodeo?)

551
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
Hey, hey. She's no joke.

552
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,340
- It must be difficult for them.
 - That's right.

553
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,870
(Seok Jin finally gets back up.)

554
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,840
That's cold. That's cold!

555
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,670
Lean back, Sung Kyoung.

556
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,140
Fall down, Sung Kyoung!

557
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,230
Hey!

558
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,310
- Hello.
 - Hey!

559
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,270
(They fall in.)

560
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,170
(She's driving him crazy.)

561
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,840
(Struggling)

562
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,970
- Gosh!
 - I'm so tired.

563
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,070
I'm so tired.

564
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,970
(He looks mad.)

565
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,340
Come back!

566
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,740
- Come back, Shin Hye.
 - Stop it!

567
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
- Come back.
 - Come back.

568
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,840
(I'm 50 and I miss my mum.)

569
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,040
- I know I look ugly right now.
 - Let's go!

570
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,470
(Shin Hye is slightly behind,)

571
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,970
(so she uses a wrestling move.)

572
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,440
She's too strong. She's fierce.

573
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,310
That's the par terre position.

574
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,770
- Isn't that too much?
 - Let's go.

575
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,910
You can't do that.

576
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,040
It's wrestling.

577
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,140
She's hanging onto him.

578
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,840
(The two queens make this a close match.)

579
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,910
(Seok Jin comes in first.)

580
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,740
- She's tired.
 - Let's go, Sung Kyoung.

581
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,340
What happened to your face, Haha?

582
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,240
(He can't stand being criticised about his face.)

583
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,660
This is too much.

584
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,940
(Gagging)

585
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,270
(The guys are exhausted.)

586
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,160
(I can't watch this.)

587
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,470
Hurry up, Sung Kyoung. Come closer.

588
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,530
(Seok Jin passes the baton to Jae Seok.)

589
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,780
I'll go fast.

590
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,430
(She starts attacking him nonetheless.)

591
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,970
(He goes fast into the water.)

592
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,210
She's no joke.

593
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,960
(Cheering)

594
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,640
This is not a party!

595
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,770
- Get on first.
 - I'm going to disturb you.

596
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,070
One, two, three.

597
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,770
(Queen Shin Hye has a new weapon.)

598
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,210
(He tries to hurry.)

599
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,240
(He's actually balancing well.)

600
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,040
(The secret is in his skinny and long legs.)

601
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,970
I won't be responsible if you fall, okay?

602
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,570
(Kwang Soo's piggyback makes her dizzy.)

603
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,540
(She still rubs the glove against his face.)

604
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,040
(Shocked)

605
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

606
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,040
(It's just a rubber glove but it's powerful.)

607
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,440
- I can't see anything!
 - This stings.

608
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,740
Wow, Sung Kyoung is fierce.

609
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,070
(The two teams are quite close.)

610
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,640
(Queen Shin Hye dangles from his back.)

611
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,470
(He doesn't budge.)

612
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,810
Good job, Kwang Soo!

613
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,670
(He shows no mercy.)

614
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,670
(Open your mouth, Jae Seok.)

615
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,470
(I'll clean your teeth for you.)

616
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,310
They're both fierce.

617
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,510
(They're worried about who they'll get.)

618
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,640
You're almost done. Hurry up.

619
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,370
She's no joke.

620
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,510
Just go in the water!

621
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,010
(The rubber glove is the first attack.)

622
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,440
Are you trying to peel the squid?

623
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,540
(She prepares the squid...)

624
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,040
(and rinses it.)

625
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,770
- Hurry up.
 - My goodness.

626
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,840
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

627
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,000
(He charges on.)

628
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,370
No!

629
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,240
(He's shocked.)

630
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,810
No! Fall in the water!

631
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,740
(She sways from side to side but he doesn't budge.)

632
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
(He overtakes the other team.)

633
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,010
Oh, wow. We're good.

634
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,610
You can do it!

635
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,470
(Are you sure?)

636
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,370
(She's fast.)

637
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,140
(He's done.)

638
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,970
Oh, dear.

639
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,340
My eyebrows are gone.

640
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,610
Gary, you're almost there! Hang in there!

641
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,940
(Queen Shin Hye and Jong Kook are too strong.)

642
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,270
(Now, it's all up to Sung Kyoung.)

643
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,240
No! No way!

644
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,510
I'm scared!

645
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,640
(They fall in.)

646
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,570
(He's more scared of her.)

647
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,200
(Sung Kyoung's splashing performance starts now.)

648
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,040
(Splashing to the left)

649
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,210
(Splashing to the right)

650
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,910
(She's incredible.)

651
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,470
(This is it!)

652
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,840
(Thanks to Sung Kyoung, the gap narrows.)

653
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,610
Hurry up. Hurry!

654
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,770
- Good job.
 - Stop it!

655
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,010
(Gary surpasses Jong Kook.)

656
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,040
Shin Hye!

657
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,940
(Queen Shin Hye's attack doesn't make him flinch.)

658
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,870
(Meanwhile, Queen Sung Kyoung attacks Jong Kook.)

659
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,710
(And she succeeds.)

660
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,770
(Thanks to Queen Sung Kyoung,)

661
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,240
(Gary crosses the finish line.)

662
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,710
(Team Sung Kyoung wins the first round.)

663
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,740
(They owe it to Sung Kyoung.)

664
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

665
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,070
I lost but I feel good about it.

666
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,210
Wait, we have to do another round.

667
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,040
We have to do another round.

668
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,740
They have another round to go.

669
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,970
It's our turn now.

670
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,210
What's more tragic is that we'll be facing Ji Hyo.

671
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,740
Try your best.

672
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,610
Try piggybacking Ji Hyo.

673
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,270
(She's the real deal.)

674
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,740
She's very fierce.

675
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,840
(Wait for me, guys.)

676
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,740
Team Ji Hyo has only 2 guys so you have to pick 2 as well.

677
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,140
- Okay!
 - Okay!

678
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,770
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
 - All right, brothers.

679
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,540
(They're too tired to be nice.)

680
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,970
- Rock, paper, scissors!
 - Rock, paper, scissors!

681
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,410
(Haha wins.)

682
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,470
Okay!

683
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,570
(He's angry and resentful.)

684
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,970
(Haha always gets lucky.)

685
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,640
(Team Sung Kyoung advances to the final round!)

686
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,740
Let's go, Ji Hyo!

687
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
(Team Sung Kyoung vs Team Ji Hyo)

688
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,020
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!

689
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,910
Look at her. Look.

690
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,570
(Ji Hyo loads herself with clothespins.)

691
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,670
(She plans to clip them all over their faces.)

692
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,660
Look how cruel she is.

693
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,410
Is she trying to exfoliate me with the scrubber?

694
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,740
(Sung Kyoung takes a scrubber.)

695
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,420
(Gary and Min Seok are good to go.)

696
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,670
Get on their backs.

697
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,610
Why has Ji Hyo gotten so light?

698
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,040
She's so light now.

699
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,440
This reminds me of the old days.

700
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,740
("Carry Your Queen")

701
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,840
(The final round begins!)

702
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,770
(Queen Sung Kyoung pours ice as soon as they start.)

703
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,040
(Squeezing)

704
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,240
(Queen Ji Hyo represses Gary by putting her legs around him.)

705
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,870
Wait!

706
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,740
(Ji Hyo is unbelievable.)

707
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,310
Ji Hyo is unbelievable. He can't even start.

708
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,810
(Queen Sung Kyoung takes out her scrubber.)

709
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,640
She's exfoliating me!

710
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,270
(Scrubbing)

711
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,640
That must hurt.

712
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,860
That's too much.

713
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,210
- He didn't even soak his skin.
 - Look at Sung Kyoung.

714
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,910
(He can't stand the pain...)

715
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,340
(and enters the water.)

716
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,470
(Meanwhile, Queen Ji Hyo...)

717
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,540
(clips Gary with clothespins and gives him a makeover.)

718
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,010
This hurts so much!

719
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,440
Come on, Ji Hyo!

720
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,610
This is so annoying! Ouch, my legs!

721
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,510
(His legs are about to give out.)

722
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,970
I'm going to cry!

723
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,570
I'm so tired!

724
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,070
(It's been a while, right?)

725
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,540
(I'm just happy to see you again, that's all.)

726
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,670
(This is a couple's synchronised swimming.)

727
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,140
(Title: Mermaid and the Ugly E.T.)

728
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,220
- She's strangling him.
 - She's no joke.

729
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,510
- She's unbelievable.
 - Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

730
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,510
Take these off now! Take these off!

731
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,410
(It wakes him up.)

732
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,470
I feel so lucky we didn't move onto the finals.

733
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,210
- I'm so thankful.
 - It's a relief.

734
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,040
Ji Hyo is too strong.

735
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,070
Come here.

736
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,010
Gary, they're far ahead of you!

737
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,070
Hey, Kwang Soo.

738
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,540
(All right, I'm on my way.)

739
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,470
(Where do you think you're going?)

740
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,740
Hey, stop!

741
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,400
(Her lethal move is wrapping her legs around him.)

742
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,740
Come on!

743
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,110
You won't know unless you experience it.

744
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,440
(But this was just the beginning.)

745
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,070
(She hits his throat at full speed.)

746
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,510
(She wrings him tightly with her legs.)

747
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,740
- Come on!
 - My legs!

748
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,170
Think of something else!

749
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,440
What's that?

750
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,070
Bear it, Gary! You can do it!

751
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,810
This is too cruel! I can't watch it any more!

752
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,870
- She is cruel. She really is.
 - This is crazy.

753
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,020
Ji Hyo, you never disappoint us.

754
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,840
Ji Hyo is impossible. She's impossible.

755
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,070
No...

756
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,810
(They go from a couple to this. What is your limit, Ji Hyo?)

757
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,640
(Thanks to Ji Hyo's interception, Gary arrives late.)

758
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,840
You're here! You're here! Okay!

759
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,840
Kwang Soo, you're in trouble now!

760
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,970
She lost a lot of her energy. She's weaker now.

761
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,340
Her entire body is a weapon.

762
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,140
(Ji Hyo holds him tightly.)

763
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,980
(Kwang Soo falters.)

764
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,070
I wasn't trying to be funny! I wasn't!

765
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,070
It's impossible to move!

766
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,770
(While Kwang Soo kneels down,)

767
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,070
What's this?

768
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,110
(Gyun Sang sprints.)

769
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,440
What's this?

770
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,710
(But not for long.)

771
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,510
- That's good! You went far.
 - I don't know how I did it.

772
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,370
(His plan is to go as far as he can since he will fall anyway.)

773
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,810
Good job, Gyun Sang! You went far!

774
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,710
(Kwang Soo tries again.)

775
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,310
Here we go.

776
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,110
(But he kneels once again.)

777
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,510
He is seriously not exaggerating.

778
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,710
- I was so shocked.
 - Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

779
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,840
Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

780
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,940
Stop her from wringing you!

781
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,240
(He collapses.)

782
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,440
(Power off)

783
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,640
How bad is she?

784
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,210
(How powerful is she?)

785
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,610
- That's great.
 - This is really crazy.

786
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,010
(Meanwhile, Gyun Sang...)

787
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,370
(throws himself in the water as planned.)

788
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,270
(Team Ji Hyo has the lead.)

789
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,440
Kwang Soo, you can stop her from tightening her legs!

790
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,540
(Kwang Soo, aims for her legs.)

791
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,270
(He attempts to stop her legs using his two hands.)

792
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,670
(Ji Hyo, forgive me...)

793
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:23,010
(for everything I've done wrong. I was wrong.)

794
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,340
(Flapping)

795
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,140
(It's no longer about competition, but about survival.)

796
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,370
Good job. She's doing well.

797
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,270
(With Ji Hyo's power and Gyun Sang's strategy,)

798
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,570
(Gyun Sang scores a goal.)

799
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,940
(They got both power and tactic. They show perfect team work.)

800
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,840
Goal!

801
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,640
Team Ji Hyo wins this round.

802
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,940
(Team Ji Hyo wins.)

803
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,810
I want everyone to experience this so that...

804
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,670
- you know I am not lying.
 - You can't walk.

805
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,710
You really can't walk.

806
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,510
Here we go.

807
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,940
- You collapse automatically.
 - I am not lying.

808
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,170
- You just collapse.
 - My back problem got fixed.

809
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,910
- Come here.
 - She corrected my spine!

810
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,440
- My cold is cured.
 - Come here. Come on.

811
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,940
Min Seok, come here.

812
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,670
But why do I have to do this to my own team member?

813
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,970
- Why do I have to feel this?
 - Just experience it.

814
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,260
(He gasps in pain.)

815
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,870
Congratulations! You will instantly feel better!

816
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,630
I was right, wasn't I?

817
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,940
That's how it is.

818
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,070
- Why am I doing this to my team?
 - After I got it,

819
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,170
my eye sight improved.

820
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,540
I see better now.

821
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,640
(Is this how variety shows works?)

822
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,190
- Here's the hint.
 - Okay.

823
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,170
In the "Carry Your Queen"...

824
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,470
We have to get this one.

825
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,040
On average, the person who dived...

826
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,840
into the water the most is the real queen.

827
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,810
- The name is...
 - Ji Hyo didn't dive much.

828
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,540
(Is it Ji Hyo?)

829
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,870
(A while ago, Ji Hyo showed an unbelievable skill.)

830
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,310
(It looks like she fell into the water many times.)

831
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,070
(They cannot remember.)

832
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,310
- Didn't she stay in the water?
 - Isn't it Sung Kyoung?

833
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,340
Sung Kyoung fell in the water a lot.

834
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,610
- Yes. I am the real queen.
 - It's not Ji Hyo.

835
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,440
I fell on my face so many times that it hurts.

836
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,510
(Who is the real queen?)

837
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,470
(The members get into their queens' cars.)

838
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,070
Something happened at home.

839
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,140
I was on the 007 special the other time, right?

840
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,780
At the time, I won a Golden Badge, right?

841
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,940
But a thief broke into my place.

842
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,280
- Really.
 - Really?

843
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,550
- Did he take the badge?
 - He took it.

844
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,440
He only took the gold that was attached to it.

845
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,440
How did he know about it? He must be a fan of Running Man.

846
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,340
He must've watched the episode.

847
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,410
- You have to be careful.
 - So today,

848
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,470
- I have to make sure to get one.
 - You have to get one.

849
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,100
You should win the gold today.

850
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,510
- There's a reason why I'm the one.
 - That's why you are the real one.

851
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,170
By the way, that team must be very quiet.

852
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,800
- Which one?
 - The one in the front.

853
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
- Oh, goodness.
 - What will they do?

854
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,940
- They will just stay quiet.
 - They'll only be breathing.

855
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,410
(Silent)

856
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,410
(Nobody is speaking.)

857
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,740
We have to use our brains and win today.

858
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,740
Otherwise, you will be flogged.

859
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,780
(Why would you break their spirits?)

860
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,010
Getting flogged on your first variety show...

861
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,010
is too sad.

862
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,210
- They only hit men, right?
 - Yes.

863
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,640
But when you get flogged, it will become a memory.

864
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,710
Good or not, you will have a memory of what a variety show is about.

865
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,410
(It becomes quiet again.)

866
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,340
(We are worried about these rookies.)

867
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,170
When I drive, I have to put on some music.

868
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,970
Let's sing. What song should we sing?

869
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,430
A rap song.

870
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,840
You go first.

871
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,570
- All eyes on me, my soul is free
 - She's actually doing it.

872
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,280
Other girls feel insecure because of me

873
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,310
They won't talk until I apologise

874
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,000
- Gosh.
 - Aren't I good?

875
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,840
- That's not it.
 - Wait.

876
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,510
- It's not that we didn't like it.
 - It's not that.

877
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,110
Concentrate! Listen! Look at me and listen!

878
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,810
- It gave me goosebumps.
 - You were too serious.

879
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,280
- Kwang Soo...
 - He interrupts my groove.

880
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,850
We don't get along well.

881
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,070
You always make me like that.

882
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,940
- What is this?
 - It's a track.

883
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,170
Get off, get off.

884
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,600
- What is it?
 - One, two, three.

885
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,240
Look at that.

886
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,240
(There is a huge structure.)

887
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,410
(What kind of mission will they carry out here?)

888
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,920
The second mission is "Queen Olympics".

889
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,950
We invited one more special queen.

890
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,360
There's another?

891
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,670
- Taekwon Girl.
 - It's her.

892
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,170
She's athlete Kim So Hee.

893
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,530
It's Kim So Hee.

894
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,810
(She will be joining the Rio 2016 Olympics.)

895
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,010
(She's got a small physique, but she has sharp kicks.)

896
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,830
She succeeds to hit the head!

897
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,920
(She is the gold medalist of the 2014 Asian Games.)

898
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,280
- She appeared like a comet.
 - Awesome.

899
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,470
(The Taekwondo queen visits Running Man!)

900
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,370
- Taekwon!
 - She must be busy.

901
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,470
- Taekwon!
 - It's an honour.

902
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,740
- Taekwon!
 - Kim So Hee.

903
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,840
I love Taekwondo, too.

904
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,970
She's black belt.

905
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,980
Preparing for Rio 2016 Summer Olympics,

906
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,970
she must be very busy right now.

907
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,870
The mission rule is simple.

908
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,780
So Hee will kick and smash...

909
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,390
- This?
 - styrofoam boards.

910
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,840
Shin Hye is really good at kicking.

911
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,510
One queen and one representative male member from each team...

912
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,210
- Gosh...
 - must beat So Hee's record.

913
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,140
The winning team will get the hint.

914
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,280
- Jong Kook.
 - Go, Jong Kook.

915
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,810
- But...
 - He has a third degree black belt.

916
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,670
- But that's...
 - Gary has eight degrees in total.

917
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,100
- But a tall person...
 - He's the master of fighting.

918
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,370
Short people can't do this.

919
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,310
Have you ever done Taekwondo?

920
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,440
- Never.
 - His nickname is Eiffel Tower.

921
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,440
- Why?
 - He can't split his legs far.

922
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,070
Is that true?

923
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,410
(His legs make a perfect A-shape.)

924
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,170
- Is that right?
 - But he's Moo Hyul.

925
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,940
- His nickname is Eiffel Tower?
 - But he's Moo Hyul.

926
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,970
- But Moo Hyul doesn't kick.
 - It's advantageous for us.

927
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,240
Moo Hyul doesn't kick!

928
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,810
- Moo Hyul doesn't kick.
 - He only uses a sword.

929
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,940
But Shin Hye is very flexible.

930
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,840
- Being flexible beats everything.
 - She's the best.

931
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,890
Anyway, the male representatives will play against the queens.

932
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,610
So Hee will first show us how it is done.

933
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,740
- Yes.
 - Please welcome So Hee.

934
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,110
- It's an honour to see your kicks.
 - Don't hurt yourself.

935
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,610
- She can kick high.
 - She can.

936
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,540
- She can kick high.
 - She can.

937
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,280
(She can kick at a 180-degree angle.)

938
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,870
- Do I have to just kick?
 - You know what will be...

939
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,130
more honourable? You have to get hit by her kick.

940
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,410
Do you want to try it?

941
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,470
- Seok Jin will try.
 - I will do it.

942
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,840
You have to put something on his head.

943
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,420
- Like that.
 - Oh, gosh.

944
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,570
It's scary.

945
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,040
- You're good at aiming, right?
 - Yes.

946
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,010
- Please do well.
 - Please.

947
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,540
Maybe she will kick his nose and his nose will fly off.

948
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,070
(That was a perfect kick.)

949
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,970
(This glorious high-kick overwhelms Seok Jin.)

950
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,610
- She makes it look easy.
 - It's really scary.

951
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,870
Like this.

952
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,640
- She's truly amazing.
 - It's really scary.

953
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,970
- So Hee.
 - You can use any form you want.

954
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,810
- Just relax and do it.
 - Come on!

955
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,540
You can do it!

956
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,670
(Her glorious kick will lead Rio 2016 Olympics.)

957
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,970
(She has charisma.)

958
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,070
The boards got ripped.

959
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,340
19.

960
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,240
- 19.
 - She kicked 19 of them.

961
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,310
19.

962
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,280
She's not a tall person, yet...

963
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,010
- Her kick was almost straight.
 - I know.

964
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,370
- Kwang Soo can...
 - Now, the team that breaks...

965
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,440
more than 20 boards will win.

966
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,940
Which team will go first? Queen Sung Kyoung!

967
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,570
She's very tall, so we have an advantage.

968
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,840
Because she's tall, she can kick more boards.

969
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,800
(Shall I give it a go?)

970
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,040
Cheer her on, please.

971
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,230
Sung Kyoung has fair skin, too.

972
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,870
- It's the same when I'm tanned.
 - She doesn't get a tan easily.

973
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,280
- How do you know that?
 - This is me being tanned.

974
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,970
- Is that right?
 - We're close friends.

975
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,870
How do you know so well?

976
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,470
- How do you know so well?
 - It doesn't make sense.

977
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,280
- How would he know that?
 - How do you know that?

978
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,810
I've known her for a long time.

979
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,930
Sung Kyoung is ignoring us.

980
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,200
(She doesn't mind them.)

981
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,280
Sung Kyoung is ignoring us.

982
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,570
(Oh my goodness!)

983
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,640
- Sung Kyoung, that's great!
 - That...

984
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,100
was really high! You reached 20.

985
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,310
She has really long legs.

986
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,440
(At this rate, they'll be able to succeed.)

987
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,810
- You can do it!
 - Can I get the tiara?

988
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,740
- You can get the tiara.
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

989
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,110
(Go for it, Sung Kyoung!)

990
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,660
- Get ready.
 - Go for it!

991
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,120
Try to stretch your leg as high as possible.

992
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,970
- Raise your leg high!
 - You can do it.

993
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,170
(Queen Sung Kyoung breaks 18 boards.)

994
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,280
You broke 18 of them.

995
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,970
- I was so close.
 - You did a good job.

996
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,370
- You're strong.
 - You did great.

997
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,440
- She broke 18 boards.
 - Okay.

998
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,710
- Queen Ji Hyo!
 - Queen Ji Hyo!

999
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,810
I think she'll break a lot.

1000
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,620
(Why am I worried about this?)

1001
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,990
Just think that's Kwang Soo.

1002
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,140
Get ready.

1003
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,440
(Let's do this as usual.)

1004
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,310
(Ji Hyo often kicked Kwang Soo very well.)

1005
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,070
(Here goes Queen Ji Hyo!)

1006
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,470
(She kicks the boards.)

1007
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,210
(Many boards are broken.)

1008
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,170
- She broke 13 of them.
 - She is...

1009
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,670
- No, she broke 11 boards.
 - It's 11.

1010
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,340
Finally, it's Queen Shin Hye's turn!

1011
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,650
(It's Queen Shin Hye's turn.)

1012
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,910
Queen Shin Hye!

1013
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,010
- I think she'll succeed.
 - Really.

1014
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,140
- She's competitive.
 - Then...

1015
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,770
- She's good at this.
 - Director!

1016
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,300
Gosh, I feel so pressured.

1017
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,480
- I feel like I must win.
 - You must.

1018
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,340
- Since you're flexible.
 - Of course.

1019
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,060
She has a flexible body.

1020
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,280
But she also has a dogged determination.

1021
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,170
(She has a dogged determination.)

1022
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,210
And...

1023
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,910
No, please stop. It's my first time here in two years.

1024
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,810
(We'll see how dogged she is.)

1025
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,250
- Don't be nervous, Shin Hye.
 - Show us how strong you are.

1026
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,970
(She looks determined.)

1027
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,970
(She has a firm stance.)

1028
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,010
(She breaks the boards.)

1029
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,030
Wow!

1030
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,440
(She breaks 19 boards.)

1031
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,170
She also made a scratch on the 20th board.

1032
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,370
- She really did.
 - That's amazing.

1033
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,740
Gosh, you were so close to it.

1034
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,310
- I was so close.
 - Right.

1035
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,610
All right.

1036
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,790
The queens have competed fiercely.

1037
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,310
- It's the guys' turn now.
 - Okay.

1038
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,710
We have many tall members.

1039
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,110
- You can do it!
 - Go for it!

1040
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,970
(Gary goes first.)

1041
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,110
Go, Gary.

1042
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,040
(What a powerful kick!)

1043
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,370
(Gary breaks 22 boards!)

1044
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,710
(That's unbelievable!)

1045
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,670
(Thanks to Gary, Team Sung Kyoung completes the mission.)

1046
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,400
That was amazing.

1047
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,740
It's Jong Kook's turn!

1048
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,610
(Jong Kook gives it a try.)

1049
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,010
(He breaks 21 boards and his team also succeeds.)

1050
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,840
(It's all up to Gyun Sang now.)

1051
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
It's Gyun Sang's turn now.

1052
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,280
His nickname is Eiffel Tower. Gyun Sang!

1053
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
(It's Gyun Sang's turn.)

1054
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,730
- He's really tall.
 - But...

1055
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,110
his body is a bit stiff.

1056
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,240
He can do it because he's tall.

1057
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,440
(Will this stiff guy be able to break the boards?)

1058
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,980
Warrior Moo Hyul!

1059
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,470
Break more than 23 boards!

1060
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,110
- What was that?
 - 23?

1061
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,370
- What did she say?
 - Surpass 23.

1062
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,460
- I'll carry out the mission...
 - What is she doing?

1063
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,640
without any mistakes.

1064
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,840
I'll start.

1065
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,310
(Start)

1066
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,940
Warrior Moo Hyul!

1067
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,840
I'll carry out the mission without any mistakes.

1068
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,340
(I'll do my best...)

1069
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,170
(with all my heart.)

1070
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,240
(Breaking)

1071
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,110
It's broken!

1072
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,370
(His performance is a bit disappointing.)

1073
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,240
(Laughing)

1074
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,720
- He made it!
 - He reached the 20th board.

1075
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,330
- It's 20!
 - It's 20.

1076
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,440
- He cleared the mission!
 - Good job.

1077
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,670
(Gyun Sang, Gary and Jong Kook broke 20, 22 and 21 boards respectively.)

1078
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,540
All three teams...

1079
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,000
cleared the mission.

1080
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,840
So we'll tell all of you what the real queen did as a hint.

1081
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,570
(They get closer to finding out who the real queen is.)

1082
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,010
(Who is the real queen?)

1083
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,330
(The real queen held hands with one of her team members.)

1084
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,010
The real queen held hands with her team member?

1085
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,210
When did she do that?

1086
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,570
I can't remember.

1087
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,210
No. Didn't she hold...

1088
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,940
someone's hand when she lifted her leg?

1089
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,870
Does it have to be a hand exactly?

1090
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,470
- Isn't it Shin Hye?
 - Hands and arms are different.

1091
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,710
Please tell us exactly. Can it be an arm instead of a hand?

1092
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,110
- This counts, too.
 - The shoulder?

1093
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,740
Please tell us exactly.

1094
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,110
- But...
 - We need to make this clear.

1095
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,740
It was great to have So Hee with us.

1096
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,320
But we'll be even more happy to see you again on television.

1097
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,670
We'll root for you, So Hee.

1098
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,040
Please take care and do your best in the Olympics.

1099
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,270
(The Rio 2016 Olympics will be held this summer.)

1100
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,610
(The Korean players will do their best and we'll root for you all.)

1101
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,800
Please don't get hurt.

1102
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,510
- It's okay if you don't get medals.
 - Right.

1103
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,940
But please do your best there.

1104
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,310
- We'll root for you.
 - He's right.

1105
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,670
Don't forget that we'll be rooting for you in Korea.

1106
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,530
- Did you hold a guy's hand?
 - I did.

1107
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,670
- I think...
 - I did.

1108
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,510
- Shin Hye held a guy's hand.
 - Right.

1109
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,710
I might be the real queen.

1110
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,630
- But they said she held hands.
 - Right.

1111
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,070
I remember that I grabbed your arm like this.

1112
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,970
Min Seok hopes that I'm the real queen.

1113
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,210
So he asked if this part can be regarded as a hand.

1114
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,420
Didn't you?

1115
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,240
I think it's not you, Sung Kyoung.

1116
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,470
Do you think so? Then leave me. You won't get the diamond.

1117
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,110
I'm confident that I'm the real queen.

1118
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,570
If you are, I think you would've tried to persuade me more.

1119
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,710
Why should I? Don't you think I was born to be the queen?

1120
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,510
Can't you feel how confident I am?

1121
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,240
Can't you?

1122
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,210
Are you smart or dumb?

1123
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,340
I'm telling you the truth.

1124
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,510
(Sung Kyoung is too confident.)

1125
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,250
It's okay. Leave us, then.

1126
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,310
- You're good.
 - Of course, I am.

1127
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,470
- She is.
 - Great.

1128
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,860
You should show me some reaction.

1129
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,140
(They head to the next mission.)

1130
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,110
(S University in Gongreung-dong, Seoul)

1131
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,430
Gosh, it's really confusing. Who's the real queen?

1132
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,210
Just believe me. Trust me.

1133
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,470
- Okay.
 - Shin Hye.

1134
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,270
- You're our queen.
 - We'll believe you.

1135
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,310
See you.

1136
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,370
(The three queens head somewhere.)

1137
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,810
Are you going to separate us?

1138
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,970
(The three queens are isolated in different rooms.)

1139
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:58,970
What's going on?

1140
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,610
It's time to make a final choice.

1141
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,150
(A final choice?)

1142
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,340
Here is The Decision Room.

1143
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,730
Find your team's queen and go into the room.

1144
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,210
Change into the team uniform of the one...

1145
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,710
who you think is the real queen...

1146
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,840
and join her team.

1147
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,000
It's so confusing.

1148
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,190
I just need one more hint.

1149
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,870
What should we do?

1150
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,440
(Their choice might change their destiny.)

1151
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,050
(There were three hints about the real queen.)

1152
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,070
(Hint 1: The real queen danced until the end.)

1153
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,300
She danced until the end.

1154
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,570
(Is Sung Kyoung the real queen?)

1155
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,910
(Hint 2: The real queen fell into the water the most.)

1156
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,870
I fell face down into the water so many times that it hurts.

1157
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,470
(Is Shin Hye the real queen?)

1158
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:53,240
(Hint 3: The real queen held a guy's hand.)

1159
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,510
(Is Ji Hyo the real queen?)

1160
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,090
(Which one of them is the real queen?)

1161
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,510
I seriously don't know.

1162
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,210
(The male members enter the rooms.)

1163
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,570
(Will they stay loyal to their original queens?)

1164
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,170
Gosh, this is not easy.

1165
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,140
(Whom will they choose?)

1166
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,830
Park Soo Kwang!

1167
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,010
(Kwang Soo acted as Soo Kwang, Sung Kyoung's partner, in a drama.)

1168
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,610
If you're not the real queen, everything will become meaningless.

1169
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,860
It's you, right?

1170
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,070
(Kwang Soo chooses Sung Kyoung.)

1171
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,110
No. I'm almost done.

1172
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,640
(5 minutes ago, Kwang Soo thought about going to Shin Hye.)

1173
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,570
(But then he contemplated.)

1174
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,670
Yes, I'm done now.

1175
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,440
(He chose Sung Kyoung in the end.)

1176
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,410
(Kwang Soo didn't betray her.)

1177
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,510
I am the real one.

1178
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,970
- Are you?
 - I am.

1179
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,010
I thought so.

1180
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,070
- I'm the real one.
 - Good.

1181
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,940
(Who will come to Shin Hye's room?)

1182
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,670
(Jong Kook enters.)

1183
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,330
- Jong Kook.
 - Hi.

1184
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,510
I am so happy.

1185
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,280
What are you so happy about?

1186
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,410
Actually,

1187
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,670
- I'm the real queen.
 - I hesitated a bit.

1188
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,940
- But for now,
 - I'm the real queen.

1189
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,310
I chose you.

1190
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,710
- Jong Kook.
 - Yes?

1191
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,570
Wow, great.

1192
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,770
(Min Seok betrays Ji Hyo and joins Shin Hye's team.)

1193
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,770
(He betrayed Ji Hyo without hesitation.)

1194
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,740
Welcome.

1195
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,210
I really hope you're the real one.

1196
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,540
Of course, I am. Don't worry.

1197
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,240
I think Jae Seok will come here, too.

1198
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,340
Really?

1199
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,670
See? I told you.

1200
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,670
(Jae Seok also joins Shin Hye's team.)

1201
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,770
I told you.

1202
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,940
Oh, it's Gary.

1203
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,870
There's someone outside.

1204
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,370
Is everyone here?

1205
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,140
(Even Seok Jin joins.)

1206
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,910
Wow, Haha.

1207
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,970
Really?

1208
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,810
- Welcome to my room.
 - You danced until the end.

1209
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:39,810
She's a bit weird.

1210
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,940
She dances automatically when she hears music. She really does.

1211
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,270
(They said the real queen danced until the end.)

1212
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,640
- See?
 - It's true.

1213
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,480
That's plausible.

1214
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,510
She really does.

1215
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,840
(Haha believes that Sung Kyoung is the real queen.)

1216
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,640
- You're right.
 - She's the real one.

1217
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,110
(While Team Sung Kyoung is having a fun time,)

1218
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,040
(Ji Hyo's room is quiet.)

1219
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,110
(Sighing)

1220
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,810
What if no one comes?

1221
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,520
(But there's a gleam of hope for Ji Hyo.)

1222
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,240
(Oh, my Gyun Sang!)

1223
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,640
Gosh, you're the best.

1224
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,620
- I'll protect you.
 - Gosh, you're so reliable.

1225
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,940
Did you just hear that? He said he'll be with me.

1226
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,410
(Gyun Sang is Ji Hyo's only team member.)

1227
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,540
You're so reliable.

1228
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:26,570
(New teams have been formed.)

1229
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,140
(What will be the final mission?)

1230
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,110
The final mission is "Protect the Queen".

1231
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,310
"Protect the Queen"?

1232
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,910
(Protect your queen's name tag.)

1233
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,410
You must protect your queen's name tag...

1234
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,560
to become the final winner.

1235
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,970
Only queens are allowed to remove other queens' name tags.

1236
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,210
If your queen's name tag is removed,

1237
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,430
all the members in her team will be out as well.

1238
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,540
However, if the winning queen isn't the real one,

1239
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,640
all the male members will be flogged as a penalty.

1240
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,610
But if the queen turns out to be the real one...

1241
00:49:58,610 --> 00:49:59,970
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1242
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,140
The male members of the other two teams...

1243
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,040
will be flogged as the penalty.

1244
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,470
You'll find Betrayal Rooms within the building.

1245
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,710
(Betrayal Room?)

1246
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,340
(It's their last chance to change their minds.)

1247
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,470
Inside the room,

1248
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,740
there is the conclusive hint about the real queen.

1249
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,890
If, during the race,

1250
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,670
you start harbouring doubts about your queen,

1251
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,340
you can go to the Betrayal Room and change your mind.

1252
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
That's a possibility.

1253
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,820
However, once you enter the room,

1254
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,210
you must change your mind.

1255
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,570
If your choice is wrong,

1256
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,840
you'll be flogged double the original amount.

1257
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,860
It's double?

1258
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,860
(If their choice is not correct, they'll be flogged twice as much.)

1259
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:55,110
(There are three Betrayal Rooms and each can be used once only.)

1260
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,470
Why would you hit us?

1261
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,640
(The race starts in 5 seconds.)

1262
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,170
What do I do?

1263
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,170
Five, four,

1264
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,640
three, two, one. The race has begun.

1265
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,740
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!

1266
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,010
(Who is the real queen?)

1267
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,770
Let's be cool and stay here.

1268
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,570
- Let's make them betray each other.
 - That's a good idea.

1269
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,740
- You can stay here.
 - I'll...

1270
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,570
- hide here.
 - I'll stay here.

1271
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,910
Can I open this somehow?

1272
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,270
(Let's look for the real queen!)

1273
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,610
(The race starts now!)

1274
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,310
Gyun Sang, I feel so safe around you.

1275
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,560
Of course.

1276
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,100
I'll guard you using my entire body.

1277
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,810
(I will protect my queen!)

1278
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,110
Shin Hye, you'll win for sure with us around.

1279
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,310
There's five of us.

1280
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,870
We'll be fine as long as you don't betray us.

1281
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,270
I won't. I swear.

1282
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,670
- Let's eliminate the guys.
 - We should.

1283
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,510
We're going to outnumber them and attack them at once, right?

1284
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,470
Let's use our number to our advantage.

1285
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,240
Where could they be?

1286
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,140
- They must be hiding.
 - I'm definitely sure about that.

1287
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,870
(Eating)

1288
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,770
(Team Sung Kyoung replenishes their energy while in hiding.)

1289
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,040
Let's take a selfie.

1290
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,040
(She's not ordinary for sure!)

1291
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,310
(Let's not betray each other and remember this moment.)

1292
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,410
- Are they not there?
 - Shall we split in half?

1293
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,540
Let's do that.

1294
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,310
Jong Kook, go this way.

1295
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,070
(They split in half for a more effective search.)

1296
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,030
- The three of us, then?
 - We can do that.

1297
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,740
This is a perfect combination.

1298
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,210
- If they...
 - I'm sorry for saying this.

1299
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,110
Would the three of you betray the rest of us?

1300
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,210
- Oh, come on.
 - Why would you say that?

1301
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,440
Look at this guy.

1302
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,340
- The three of you could do that.
 - No way.

1303
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,610
The three of you could each enter a Betrayal Room.

1304
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:41,510
You can do that as soon as you find the rooms.

1305
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,970
- That's nonsense.
 - That'll put us at a disadvantage.

1306
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,470
What are you talking about?

1307
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,910
- Don't say that.
 - Wait a minute.

1308
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,670
Let's see what happens if you betray us.

1309
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,370
- I won't.
 - I'll rip the skin off your backs.

1310
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,570
Watch me.

1311
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,070
Jong Kook, let's put these two in separate groups.

1312
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,510
Min Seok can go to this group. Stay with him.

1313
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,840
- That's a good idea.
 - I saw Seok Jin's face.

1314
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,570
- I can't trust them.
 - I know what you mean.

1315
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,560
Wait. I have a bad feeling about this.

1316
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,340
- Let's go, Jong Kook.
 - All right.

1317
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,270
- Hey.
 - Get rid of the guys.

1318
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,770
- Eliminate Gyun Sang immediately.
 - Okay.

1319
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,070
Ji Hyo is calling.

1320
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,570
- Yes, Ji Hyo.
 - Where are you?

1321
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,100
I'm by the Gifted Education Centre.

1322
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,940
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1323
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,270
You have to stay alive.

1324
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,110
It's this way. Come this way, Gary.

1325
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,270
(They're nervous.)

1326
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,340
- Can we do it on our own?
 - We better bring the others.

1327
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,270
- Can we do it?
 - Let's bring them.

1328
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,270
Hold on.

1329
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,470
Seok Jin, come here. Come in.

1330
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,310
- Come inside.
 - Hurry up.

1331
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,840
- Why?
 - Don't go in.

1332
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,070
There's only room for three. Betray your team and join us.

1333
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,710
- She's the real one.
 - I swear.

1334
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,840
- I'm the queen.
 - She is. Come inside.

1335
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,540
- Are you the real queen?
 - I told you I was the real one.

1336
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,170
- She's being honest.
 - Are you sure?

1337
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,740
- You caught me.
 - She's being serious.

1338
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,840
There's room for three, so betray them.

1339
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,440
(Is it Shin Hye or Sung Kyoung? That is the question.)

1340
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,940
(What will Seok Jin do?)

1341
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,610
- Team...
 - Betrayers. Cross!

1342
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,240
Isn't this too early in the game?

1343
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,940
I can tell that she's real.

1344
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,210
I'm being serious!

1345
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,810
I think I was dancing until the end.

1346
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,440
I was dancing until the music ended.

1347
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,970
- She'll start moving once you clap.
 - She's the real queen.

1348
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,070
(Is this strong enough of an evidence?)

1349
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,270
- I'm the real one.
 - This is driving me nuts.

1350
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,670
This is strange, but...

1351
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,370
I feel better after looking at Sung Kyoung.

1352
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,040
- Right?
 - I don't know why.

1353
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,610
- Go to the room.
 - You won't regret it.

1354
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,070
- There are only three rooms.
 - This is the third floor, right?

1355
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,670
- Text us.
 - There are only three.

1356
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,110
(Is Team Shin Hye swayed?)

1357
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,510
Oh, gosh.

1358
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,410
The real queen danced until the end.

1359
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:51,070
(Is Sung Kyoung the last one to stop dancing?)

1360
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,340
She fell into the water the most.

1361
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,610
(Did she fall in the most?)

1362
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,310
- She held hands with a male member?
 - She did?

1363
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,310
When did she do that?

1364
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,540
(Is Sung Kyoung the one who held a male member's hand?)

1365
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,010
(This moment of choice will change their destiny.)

1366
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,340
(Will they decide to betray their team?)

1367
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,340
I think we can talk them into entering the Betrayal Room.

1368
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,240
They'll go in for sure.

1369
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,570
- But we're done for if they see us.
 - I agree.

1370
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,910
(Is this the end for us?)

1371
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,140
Gyun Sang, you should...

1372
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,570
(Ji Hyo hesitates to speak.)

1373
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,640
I should what?

1374
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,640
(What's wrong, Ji Hyo?)

1375
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,110
Move to...

1376
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,940
another team...

1377
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,110
before the Rooms get used up.

1378
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,610
(Ji Hyo is being thoughtful because Gyun Sang is on his own.)

1379
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,810
To tell you the truth,

1380
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,670
I'm very happy that you came to me.

1381
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,170
But I don't want you to die on your own.

1382
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:03,640
(Ji Hyo plans to get a hint through Gyun Sang.)

1383
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,610
She said she's the queen inside my heart.

1384
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,570
(You're the only queen for me.)

1385
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,240
Thank you. Thank you, Gyun Sang.

1386
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,370
Don't say that.

1387
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,040
I hope, like in the movies, she turns out to be the real one.

1388
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,510
(Is Ji Hyo the real queen like Gyun Sang wished for?)

1389
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,670
Let me turn this on.

1390
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,090
(6 hours ago)

1391
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,320
I knew it.

1392
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,870
Ji Hyo, you're not the real queen.

1393
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,510
(Ji Hyo is not the real queen!)

1394
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,870
This is the Gifted Education Centre.

1395
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,940
I thought it was this way.

1396
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,910
Ji Hyo!

1397
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,910
Ji Hyo is here. She's here.

1398
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,870
- Hurry up.
 - Is it just the two of you?

1399
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,310
Ji Hyo, tell me this. Are you the real queen?

1400
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,430
I'm not. I'm trying to help you.

1401
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,470
(She tells the truth so that they can form an ally.)

1402
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,240
- It's not me.
 - That sounds so convincing.

1403
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,440
- I'm trying to help you.
 - She won't betray us.

1404
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,770
Then let's have Gyun Sang visit the Betrayal Room.

1405
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,340
(Gyun Sang heads to the Betrayal Room for the hint.)

1406
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,410
You're my queen. Right, Ji Hyo?

1407
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,410
(You're my queen.)

1408
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,940
- Of course.
 - I'll be back.

1409
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:12,840
(Oh, goodness.)

1410
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,960
Stop talking rubbish. Hurry up.

1411
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,440
- Where is it, anyway?
 - Hurry up.

1412
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,040
- Where was it?
 - Look for it.

1413
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,640
(Will Gyun Sang earn the hint and return safely?)

1414
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,480
(Striding)

1415
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,770
I feel so bad.

1416
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,110
(I'll do this for Ji Hyo.)

1417
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,740
I feel like I'm betraying Ji Hyo.

1418
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,740
(They search intently.)

1419
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,810
(If he gets caught by Team Shin Hye, their plan will be over.)

1420
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,210
They're not here either?

1421
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,670
(Finally,)

1422
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,540
(he finds the Betrayal Room!)

1423
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,110
(There's a decisive hint in this room about the queen's identity.)

1424
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,640
(Gyun Sang has no choice but to betray Ji Hyo now.)

1425
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,710
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1426
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,510
(He changes his mind after Ji Hyo convinces him to do so.)

1427
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,530
(My goodness!)

1428
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:07,630
(What is the hint?)

1429
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,940
Where are they?

1430
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,740
There are so many of us, so they must be hiding.

1431
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,840
They can't do anything by hiding.

1432
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,440
- What's that?
 - Somebody betrayed their team.

1433
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
No way.

1434
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,540
The Betrayal Room on the fourth floor is closed.

1435
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,310
- The Betrayal Room on...
 - I think it was the tall guy.

1436
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,040
Let's go to the fourth floor.

1437
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,410
Let's check it out.

1438
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,510
(What is Gyun Sang's new guess?)

1439
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,340
Let's go.

1440
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,040
We have to eliminate them fast.

1441
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,140
(The allies also head to the 4th floor.)

1442
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,070
Gyun Sang.

1443
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,470
(Oh, my! Is he wearing yellow?)

1444
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,940
(He decides to be loyal to Queen Sung Kyoung.)

1445
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,470
I saw the hint.

1446
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,710
- Be quiet.
 - I saw the decisive hint.

1447
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,740
- I changed my shirt.
 - You probably changed it before.

1448
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,240
I saw the hint before I changed my shirt.

1449
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,640
You change afterwards.

1450
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,940
(He knows the hint?)

1451
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,810
- I'm telling the truth.
 - No way.

1452
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,640
There are two rooms left. I'm telling the truth.

1453
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,040
(He warns everybody else...)

1454
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,270
(and runs for his life.)

1455
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,910
(They feel conflicted again.)

1456
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,150
Should we switch?

1457
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,110
- Let's eliminate him first.
 - That's the first step.

1458
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,170
- Come on.
 - I can't run because of my back.

1459
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,710
I want to be able to help.

1460
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,340
(Gyun Sang runs to find Queen Sung Kyoung.)

1461
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,710
Where did he go?

1462
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,740
Where did he go?

1463
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,810
- Come here!
 - Where?

1464
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,840
Ji Hyo.

1465
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,670
Gary, Gyun Sang changed his shirt.

1466
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,840
- Did you make him?
 - Yes, I did.

1467
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,040
- It doesn't matter if I die.
 - I know.

1468
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,370
- Let's eliminate her.
 - It doesn't matter.

1469
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,410
- Let's eliminate her.
 - You can kill me.

1470
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,640
- The three of us?
 - But be careful.

1471
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,810
But I want to see what colour Gyun Sang is wearing.

1472
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,140
- It's yellow.
 - He's wearing yellow.

1473
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,140
It's yellow, right? See?

1474
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,810
(Ripping)

1475
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,440
- That's fine.
 - She's not it.

1476
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,110
- Okay.
 - You're all going to be flogged.

1477
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,810
You'll all be flogged. You better run to the Betrayal Room.

1478
00:59:58,810 --> 00:59:59,810
(They're suddenly panicking.)

1479
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:00,810
- Did you...
 - We'll be flogged?

1480
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,740
I told you already.

1481
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,740
It's not Shin Hye. It's Sung Kyoung.

1482
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,010
That's not true.

1483
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,640
- This is...
 - I don't care.

1484
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,510
- It's not Ji Hyo, right?
 - Gyun Sang...

1485
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,610
- had the hint for sure.
 - Right?

1486
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,640
- Is that right?
 - He chose based on the hint.

1487
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,800
What hint?

1488
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,940
- Does he still have it?
 - There was a hint...

1489
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,840
- in the Betrayal Room.
 - Of course, there is.

1490
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,340
Let's go.

1491
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,310
- Shin Hye, say something.
 - No, it's not.

1492
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,010
It's not that. That's not it.

1493
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,040
Did you see that? I told you. I told you things will become chaotic.

1494
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,200
Gyun Sang holds an important key.

1495
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,940
(What does she mean?)

1496
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,720
(Strolling)

1497
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,340
Are you not well? Why are you walking so slowly?

1498
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,170
My back hurts, so I will walk slowly.

1499
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,340
Please guard Shin Hye well.

1500
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,110
- My gosh.
 - My back really hurts.

1501
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,450
- Really?
 - I kept shouting a while ago.

1502
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,070
(She's nervous.)

1503
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,140
There are only two rooms left.

1504
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,210
(The crack in the team is getting bigger and bigger.)

1505
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,970
(Jae Seok, who trusts Shin Hye, searches the 5th floor.)

1506
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,640
They are here. They're here.

1507
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,670
(Team Sung Kyoung appears!)

1508
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,940
(They finally get the chance to make a roundup.)

1509
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,210
Come down. Everyone, hurry up and come down.

1510
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,540
We have to go down.

1511
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,940
Go down?

1512
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,340
My back hurts.

1513
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,930
Good, good. The vibe is good now.

1514
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,910
All right. Let's just make one more person our team.

1515
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,670
(Team Shin Hye starts the arrest operation.)

1516
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,370
We can meet them.

1517
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,170
- We can meet them.
 - It's Shin Hye.

1518
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:35,010
- You left. Min Seok, look.
 - Shin Hye, wait.

1519
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,270
- The hint is "Crazy".
 - No.

1520
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,260
- No.
 - The hint is "Crazy".

1521
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,860
(Was that the hint Gyun Sang read?)

1522
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,270
Go to the Betrayal Room.

1523
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,440
There are two rooms left.

1524
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,540
Why do you think he didn't go to the team with more people?

1525
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,940
- It's because...
 - There are two left.

1526
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,370
- The hint is "Crazy".
 - Ji Hyo sent them to us on purpose.

1527
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,570
If we win, you will live.

1528
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,470
- Living is more important.
 - Think about it.

1529
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,340
(If the hint is really "Crazy",)

1530
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,840
(Sung Kyoung is certainly the queen.)

1531
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,440
Hey.

1532
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,360
Gyun Sang, you betrayer.

1533
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,470
- That's not it.
 - Jong Kook.

1534
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,140
- Jong Kook, join us.
 - Hurry up.

1535
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,240
(It's your choice to receive the flogging or not.)

1536
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,040
- Hurry. You don't have time.
 - Just join us.

1537
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,630
- Jong Kook!
 - Jong Kook!

1538
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,310
What floor was it, Gyun Sang?

1539
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,880
- What floor was it? The 4th floor?
 - The 4th floor.

1540
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,340
- Then...
 - But it took us three seconds.

1541
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,250
come down to the second floor. Hurry.

1542
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,370
- Hey!
 - Okay.

1543
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,510
(Yes!)

1544
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,510
What? What's going on? What is he doing?

1545
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,370
- Run! Ride the elevator!
 - What's this?

1546
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,210
What's wrong?

1547
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,610
(They rush to the Betrayal Room.)

1548
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:38,340
- Hurry up.
 - Go to the second floor.

1549
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,610
- Catch Jong Kook.
 - Where was it? There it is.

1550
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,610
(But they are too late.)

1551
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,460
- Hey!
 - I'm in.

1552
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,670
I'm good.

1553
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,640
(He's ready to betray!)

1554
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
When we come together, we can catch him.

1555
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,140
As soon as he comes out, we must eliminate him.

1556
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,310
Someone could've gone to the third floor.

1557
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,910
(And that would be Gary.)

1558
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,310
What's this?

1559
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,470
(Seok Jin already entered the room on the 3rd floor.)

1560
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,770
(When it comes to betrayal, Seok Jin is better.)

1561
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,210
Whoever comes first gets to take the room.

1562
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:17,870
(The last Betrayal Room goes to Seok Jin.)

1563
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,210
I'm done.

1564
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,470
(Seok Jin takes the last Room.)

1565
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,910
(Gary is sad.)

1566
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:27,170
(Gyun Sang, Jong Kook and Seok Jin betray their teams.)

1567
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,070
(The Betrayal Rooms are sold out!)

1568
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,680
- What is it?
 - You go first.

1569
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,270
You're alone. Wait. What's this?

1570
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,710
- Come here.
 - This is the time.

1571
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,940
Catch Min Seok!

1572
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,820
- Hey!
 - Hey!

1573
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,310
- Catch Min Seok!
 - Shin Hye!

1574
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:48,710
(The lone chick becomes a good target.)

1575
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,840
(His name tag is ripped.)

1576
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,970
- We did it. Catch Jae Seok!
 - We did it.

1577
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,370
Catch Jae Seok!

1578
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,440
(It's chaos.)

1579
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,620
Min Seok is out. Min Seok is out.

1580
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,870
He's our team.

1581
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:07,940
(He can't believe it.)

1582
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,940
We got tricked by Jong Kook.

1583
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,370
In any case, betray me and...

1584
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,440
Trust us.

1585
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,640
I will rip the skin off your backs.

1586
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,510
Watch me.

1587
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,250
I am so angry!

1588
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,540
Kim Jong Kook.

1589
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,670
(He gets betrayed by the one he trusted.)

1590
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,940
(I've been waiting for you to come out of this room.)

1591
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,610
Gary, this isn't right.

1592
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,970
I can't help it either. I have to survive.

1593
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,270
Wait a minute!

1594
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:45,610
(While Gary can't run, Seok Jin sprints.)

1595
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:49,510
Seok Jin! Seok Jin! Come down!

1596
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,820
- Come on.
 - Come on down.

1597
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,240
Hurry up and come down!

1598
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,820
(Jong Kook joins Team Sung Kyoung, too!)

1599
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,940
High-five!

1600
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,340
(Welcome to the team!)

1601
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,970
(Jong Kook is the VIP member!)

1602
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,970
Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!

1603
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,140
You've been waiting to change teams.

1604
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,940
- You've been waiting.
 - That's right.

1605
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,210
- You've waited.
 - We did it.

1606
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,210
(What was the hint that Jong Kook and Seok Jin saw?)

1607
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,870
"Crazy".

1608
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,770
(Gyun Sang was telling the truth.)

1609
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:23,870
It's right.

1610
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,940
(If the hint is "Crazy",)

1611
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:33,040
(the queen is Sung Kyoung for sure.)

1612
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,510
(In the preliminary meeting, she picked a rose.)

1613
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,140
Sung Kyoung, you are the real queen.

1614
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,210
(All right!)

1615
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:48,910
(Sung Kyoung is the real queen!)

1616
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,740
They have more people. Why take more people?

1617
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,340
Jong Kook ran down.

1618
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,510
I am sorry, Jae Seok.

1619
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,740
I am sorry, Jae Seok. I am not the real queen.

1620
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,510
- You're not?
 - You're not?

1621
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:02,040
(You are not the real queen?)

1622
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,140
I wanted to win the game.

1623
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,670
Honestly, when I went to the Room, Seok Jin was already there.

1624
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,940
I was a little late.

1625
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,200
When I saw your face, you didn't look so confident.

1626
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,940
Honestly, Shin Hye,

1627
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:21,440
- I've been looking for loopholes.
 - I know it.

1628
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,140
- Jae Seok, we can...
 - I wanted to win fast.

1629
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,240
(They have only one option.)

1630
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,710
We have to rip Sung Kyoung's name tag.

1631
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,540
That's better even if we get flogged.

1632
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,840
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

1633
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,010
- You have to rip her name tag.
 - I will.

1634
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:38,440
- We will wrap it up.
 - Okay.

1635
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,170
I can hear something.

1636
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,370
The only thing that team can do is eliminate Sung Kyoung.

1637
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,170
So we have to guard her well.

1638
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,010
(They will guard Sung Kyoung with all their strength.)

1639
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,340
(Only the queens are allowed to rip each other's name tags.)

1640
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,760
- There!
 - Where?

1641
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,930
Hey, be careful!

1642
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,960
Where?

1643
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,540
(The final battle begins.)

1644
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,240
(They're surprised by the army of members.)

1645
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,710
Why are they so bold?

1646
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,410
- What gave you the courage?
 - They're out of their wits.

1647
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:07,680
That's right.

1648
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,970
You must've thought very easily of me.

1649
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,070
No. No.

1650
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,770
I'm so scared.

1651
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,240
Come on.

1652
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,170
- She's strong. She's strong.
 - Shin Hye.

1653
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:24,800
(We just have to protect Sung Kyoung.)

1654
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,780
- Shin Hye.
 - She's strong.

1655
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,740
(Team Sung Kyoung is confident.)

1656
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,440
- You...
 - You can't rip her name tag anyway.

1657
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,670
Grab her!

1658
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:35,410
(They grab Sung Kyoung!)

1659
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:39,010
(They wait for the right timing and launch an attack!)

1660
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,610
(What will happen?)

1661
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,640
(Ripping)

1662
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:49,410
(Has someone's name tag been ripped?)

1663
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:50,710
You have to rip it!

1664
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:55,340
(Sung Kyoung is on the floor. Is she out?)

1665
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,710
(Queen Sung Kyoung is alive!)

1666
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:03,040
- We got it. Jae Seok is out.
 - That was close.

1667
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,740
I'm out.

1668
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,810
(Jae Seok is out.)

1669
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,040
Grab her!

1670
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,930
- No! No!
 - Come on!

1671
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,710
(Ripping)

1672
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,570
(Even Jae Seok's last attempt was in vain.)

1673
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,640
(Queen Shin Hye is in trouble.)

1674
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,870
Be careful. You have to survive.

1675
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,270
(She launches another attack!)

1676
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,470
(It's Shin Hye versus Sung Kyoung.)

1677
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,580
(Only the queens can rip each other's name tags.)

1678
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,080
Shin Hye, please.

1679
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,040
(Gary can't fight any longer.)

1680
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,210
- Time to go.
 - He's ripped.

1681
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,740
No. Come on.

1682
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,500
- Sung Kyoung.
 - We have no choice.

1683
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,970
- We have to do this, Shin Hye.
 - You can do it.

1684
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,540
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin join.)

1685
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,040
Shin Hye, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1686
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,770
Shin Hye, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1687
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:54,870
(Shin Hye is out.)

1688
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,580
Sorry, Shin Hye!

1689
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,970
(Shin Hye is out.)

1690
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:05,580
(Team Sung Kyoung wins.)

1691
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,370
("Protect the Queen" is over.)

1692
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:11,010
Sung Kyoung managed to survive until the end. Please go up to the podium.

1693
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,810
(Sung Kyoung was the real queen.)

1694
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,270
She was the real queen!

1695
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,370
(Sung Kyoung was the real queen.)

1696
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,710
It was her!

1697
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,440
How is it, Min Seok? Ready to be flogged?

1698
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,710
- There it is!
 - What's that?

1699
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,610
Inside her shoe, it says "Real Queen".

1700
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:31,710
(The identity of the real queen was written inside the shoe.)

1701
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:35,240
The true queen, Sung Kyoung, will receive this diamond tiara.

1702
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,720
(She receives a diamond tiara.)

1703
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,170
- It's beautiful.
 - Wear it over your hat.

1704
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,670
(The ones who chose Sung Kyoung will be exempt from the penalty.)

1705
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,310
Now, it's time to get flogged.

1706
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,010
It's time.

1707
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,640
(The time has come.)

1708
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,670
(It's flogging time!)

1709
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,440
- I love you.
 - He turned it sideways.

1710
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,140
You have to hit lower.

1711
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,510
Oh, here?

1712
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,470
(Ouch!)

1713
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:08,240
(What a strong swing!)

1714
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,490
My goodness.

1715
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,840
- That looked painful.
 - You held on. Good job.

1716
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,140
That really hurt.

1717
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,670
- I'll start.
 - Okay.

1718
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,670
Poor you.

1719
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,740
Stop rubbing it.

1720
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,850
You've made a wrong decision.

1721
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,110
Poor you.

1722
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,210
I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

1723
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:22,760
- You've made a wrong decision.
 - I'm fine, Shin Hye.

1724
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,010
Poor you.

1725
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,040
(Slap)

1726
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,370
(The power from the hit makes him stand up.)

1727
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,110
- That was strong.
 - It really hurts.

1728
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,770
(He can feel the pain rising from his bottom.)

1729
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,020
Don't rub with your hands.

1730
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,810
I suddenly feel competitive about this.

1731
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,080
What?

1732
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,770
I just don't want to lose.

1733
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,580
I just don't want to feel defeated.

1734
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,080
(He swings far.)

1735
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,140
- My goodness.
 - I just don't...

1736
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,080
- want to lose.
 - All right. How about...

1737
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,410
after saying goodbye, you flog him immediately?

1738
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,010
All right. Let Kwang Soo's swing be the finisher.

1739
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,270
(What?)

1740
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,810
Does that mean I can't say goodbye?

1741
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,710
(Everyone agrees to end the day with Kwang Soo's swing.)

1742
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,440
All right, queens.

1743
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,940
How was it today? Your drama will be aired soon, too.

1744
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,640
Yes, our new drama "Doctors" will air tomorrow evening.

1745
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,580
We hope you love our new drama.

1746
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,840
(While the queens say goodbye,)

1747
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,340
(Kwang Soo warms up.)

1748
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,470
(Gary can only laugh.)

1749
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,890
I became the real queen today...

1750
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:22,010
and also won the race.

1751
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:23,130
(He practises swinging.)

1752
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,440
I'd like to come on this show again.

1753
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,910
(Now's the time!)

1754
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:26,940
He's...

1755
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,670
(Jae Seok flogs him.)

1756
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,110
Okay. We're done for today.

1757
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,300
(A flogging for a flogging.)

1758
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,410
(We'd like to thank all our guests for joining us today.)

1759
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,140
- Well done!
 - Thank you!

1760
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,080
(The strongest enemies have appeared in front of Running Man.)

1761
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,240
(Lee Kyung Kyu and the Avengers)

1762
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,110
(They compete for the throne.)

1763
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,670
(This will be a completely different type of variety show.)

1764
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,140
("Running Rumble", a survival game, is coming soon.)

1765
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,170
(Name Tag Elimination with never-ending twists)

1766
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,770
(Who will be the last one standing?)

1767
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,540
It was really fun. I'll be going now.

1768
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,470
(Running Man vs Avengers)
