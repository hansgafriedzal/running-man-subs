1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,110
(Client A secretly contacts the Running Man staff.)

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,950
- It's nice to meet you.
 -  Hello.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,910
What do you think about Running Man?

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,330
I think it's about time for a transformation.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,110
In other words, there must be a thorough change.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,650
Jae Seok...

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,060
keeps working with SBS through Running Man.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,050
He's very tenacious.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,350
(He's jealous.)

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,180
And Seok Jin...

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
is just lucky to be there.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,850
Haha is also barely surviving in this programme.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,250
He lacks artistic ability...

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,050
and only works for commercial purposes.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,050
Ji Hyo...

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,780
has good chemistry with Gary.

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,610
She tries to make Running Man funny through that awkward chemistry.

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,180
It will be funnier if Ji Hyo loses her mind...

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,550
and starts to love Kwang Soo.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,160
You need such extreme elements on this show.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,280
Family members gather together and watch TV on Sunday nights.

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,450
Then who will attract the viewers?

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,180
It's me. I will do it!

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,620
(I can attract the viewers for you!)

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,650
Who are they?

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,680
(The members encounter their worst enemies.)

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
(Who are they?)

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,810
(Mysterious people have come to teach the members a lesson.)

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,850
That's a foul!

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,710
(Screaming)

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,210
(What will become of the fate of the Running Man members?)

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,540
This is too hard.

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,610
(What will become of the fate of the Running Man members?)

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,850
(The Variety Avengers will teach the members a lesson.)

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,050
It's the Avengers.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,410
So today, the guests are...

37
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,010
- the Avengers?
 -  The set is very fancy, too.

38
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,080
- Avengers?
 -  What are the Avengers?

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,880
Now,

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,750
the guests are here to attack you.

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,380
(They're here to attack us?)

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,720
Do we really deserve to be attacked?

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,400
Why do guests attack us every week?

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,680
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,110
How can we become targets every week?

46
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,830
Let's welcome the Avengers.

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,020
Please come in!

48
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,530
(Let's meet the guests.)

49
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,020
(Who are the Avengers?)

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,050
I will change everything.

51
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,050
It's me who can do that!

52
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,280
(What?)

53
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,020
(Is he sleeping?)

54
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,110
Is he Gyeong Gyu?

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,750
(The forefather of variety shows, Lee Gyeong Gyu)

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,750
Gosh, it's Gyeong Gyu.

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
Is he really Gyeong Gyu.

58
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,910
(This is a first time a guest has made an appearance by lying down.)

59
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,910
My goodness.

60
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,150
I've never seen anyone who lied down on stage like him.

61
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,950
(Goodness.)

62
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,810
(He shows off his slapstick humour.)

63
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,980
Hello!

64
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,580
(Screaming)

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,610
Hello!

66
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,180
(Let's welcome the best comedian, Lee Gyeong Gyu.)

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,110
(Client A was Gyeong Gyu, the king of variety shows.)

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,010
He is the first person to appear on a show lying down.

69
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,380
He's the king of variety shows. It's Gyeong Gyu.

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I didn't mean to come on stage while lying down.

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,980
I was just resting, and the platform suddenly started moving.

72
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,480
- Were you?
 -  While you were resting?

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,110
- That's really funny.
 -  Today's concept is predictable.

74
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,600
Gyeong Gyu is here today.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,940
(Today's show isn't going to be easy.)

76
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,350
The good thing is, I think we can go home early today.

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,780
(Gyeong Gyu loves to finish work as early as possible.)

78
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,000
The first time in a long time.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,410
He's not like that these days.

80
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,280
I guess I can eat dinner at home tonight.

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,350
- Thank you.
 -  I'll eat dinner at home.

82
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,180
- Thank you, Gyeong Gyu.
 -  No, you're wrong. It's lunch.

83
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,350
Can I eat lunch at home today?

84
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,850
(Gyeong Gyu's principle at work: "Eat lunch at home.")

85
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,780
It's 9:30am and you're saying we'll finish by lunch time?

86
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,220
Your aim is to eat lunch at home.

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,990
- Can you eat lunch at home?
 -  We can have a late lunch.

88
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,340
- I've brought 6 people with me.
 -  Who are they?

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,010
- They are my team.
 -  So did you...

90
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,180
form a team for today?

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,910
- I did it by myself.
 -  Variety Avengers, right?

92
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,850
(Variety Avengers are here with Gyeong Gyu today.)

93
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,050
- Get ready to meet the Avengers.
 -  All right. Let's see.

94
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,310
Come on, Avengers!

95
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,580
- Please come out.
 -  Come out!

96
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,980
(Who are the mysterious 6 that the king of variety shows enlisted?)

97
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,830
(Watch out, Running Man.)

98
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,550
- Who are they?
 -  Amazing.

99
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,890
- Wow.
 -  It's Lee Su Min.

100
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,710
(They are surprised.)

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,050
(Here comes the members of the Variety Avengers.)

102
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,410
(They are very popular and famous in variety shows these days.)

103
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,510
They are too tough.

104
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,180
(Team Avengers)

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,090
(The Running Man members must face powerful foes and fight.)

106
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,570
(Will they be able to overcome and win today's match up?)

107
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,750
- All right, Team Avengers.
 -  Yes.

108
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,880
- You're here today with Gyeong Gyu.
 -  That's right.

109
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,610
- What a strong team you have today.
 -  Yes. You're right.

110
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,080
I'll introduce your personal rivals.

111
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,320
Who is Joon Hyun's rival?

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,980
All right. Well, Kwang Soo is his rival.

113
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,150
- Am I?
 -  Yes.

114
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,010
- Kwang Soo's nickname is Giraffe.
 -  Right.

115
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,880
Joon Hyun is an Asian black bear.

116
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,080
- Asian black bear.
 -  Is he an Asian black bear?

117
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,950
I think this bear was raised in a zoo.

118
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,910
- He doesn't look intimidating.
 -  I was raised by humans.

119
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,410
(He's not a wild bear. He's just a cute, cuddly bear.)

120
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,850
- I don't act fiercely like this.
 -  He doesn't harm people.

121
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,080
- Please continue.
 -  He's so kind.

122
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,450
He's from a bear farm.

123
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,910
(So he's not wild at all.)

124
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,450
He's farmed. Not caught wild.

125
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,180
- Not caught wild.
 -  Okay.

126
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,050
- He's raised at home.
 -  I don't eat anything...

127
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,850
- like salmon. I love bear food.
 -  You love bear food.

128
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,830
- Because I'm farmed.
 -  I see.

129
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,480
- Cho Sae Ho is next.
 -  All right. He's...

130
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,990
the new trend in variety shows. He's a flower of variety shows.

131
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,740
- He's very popular.
 -  A flower?

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,810
He's the flower of variety shows.

133
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,900
- I was originally just a weed,
 -  He was a weed.

134
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,790
- but I'm about to fully bloom.
 -  He's turning into a flower.

135
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,650
That's why he's the flower of variety shows.

136
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,280
Are you sure he's not a monkey?

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,780
- A monkey?
 -  I thought of a pig.

138
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,950
Don't talk like that. You're discriminating him.

139
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,480
- Isn't that your speciality?
 -  Gyeong Gyu.

140
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,250
I thought you were really good at making fun of others.

141
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,250
(Embarrassed)

142
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,570
I've prepared nothing special,

143
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,790
but Ji Hyo is older than me.

144
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,250
So I want to show my respect to Ji Hyo by singing a song.

145
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,180
Don't sing the songs that you sang last time.

146
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,960
Sure. I excluded them.

147
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,410
- I'll sing a new song. A new song.
 -  A new one? Okay, please begin.

148
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,000
- It's called, "My Sister".
 -  "My Sister"?

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,110
- Can you please stand here?
 -  Me?

150
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,380
Yes. Since you're my rival.

151
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,600
Please don't feel lonely

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,250
(Slapping)

153
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,150
(He retreats quickly.)

154
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,210
- She's tougher than I thought.
 -  He called her "tough".

155
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,380
What do you mean, "Please don't feel lonely"? I'm not lonely.

156
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,600
- They're just lyrics.
 -  Did you see her?

157
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,080
When he asked Ji Hyo to come out, she said,

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
- "Me"? She wasn't satisfied.
 -  No.

159
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,380
(No thank you. I don't want to hear you sing.)

160
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,550
She really slapped him.

161
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,380
- I was really surprised to see him.
 -  Amazing.

162
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,110
My goodness.

163
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,780
- He doesn't seem to belong here.
 -  Gyeong Gyu,

164
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,550
- why is Jung Jin here?
 -  It's because..

165
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,150
- his film will be released soon.
 -  Is that so?

166
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,940
So he was looking for a show to advertise...

167
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,870
his film on, but couldn't find a proper one.

168
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,410
- There wasn't a proper one.
 -  But...

169
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,580
why is he mingled with variety show stars and not actors?

170
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,380
That's a good question.

171
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,610
You'd normally come with people who worked with you on the film.

172
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,290
- That's more common.
 -  That's why.

173
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,950
By the way, who is the rival of Jung Jin?

174
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,250
- His rival?
 -  Yes.

175
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,310
It's Gary.

176
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,550
- Me?
 -  Yes. Gary.

177
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,450
- That's strange.
 -  They don't match.

178
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,080
Jung Jin will beat Gary with his good looks.

179
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,480
I see. You're talking about their appearances.

180
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,010
One's really handsome, while the other is not.

181
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,580
Good to see you, Gary.

182
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,710
(I'm here to teach you a lesson with my good looks, Gary.)

183
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,150
(They are both human, but they look completely different.)

184
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,650
Am I being intimidated by his looks?

185
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,560
Is this your tactic?

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,740
Yes, you got the point.

187
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,200
- How can you?
 -  But Gary does look ugly.

188
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,580
You really do look ugly compared to him.

189
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,070
- He makes me take a step back.
 -  You look even worse.

190
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,200
He's using his looks.

191
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,450
All right. Who's next? It's you, Su Min.

192
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,050
(Lee Su Min, a new and young MC who is recently adored by many.)

193
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,810
Shouldn't she be Ji Hyo's rival?

194
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,850
No, not for today.

195
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,310
- It's not?
 -  I'll match two extreme opposites.

196
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,780
- How will it be, then?
 -  Seok Jin's her rival.

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
(A grandpa in variety shows vs a toddler in variety shows)

198
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,650
She can be my daughter.

199
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,210
She's really young.

200
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,000
If they stand next to each other,

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Seok Jin will look even older than he really is.

202
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,360
That's why she's the rival of Seok Jin.

203
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,450
All right, Su Min.

204
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,780
(She'll introduce herself through dancing and intimidate Seok Jin.)

205
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
What's going on?

206
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,050
(This song sounds familiar.)

207
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,110
She's great.

208
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,450
Shy, shy, shy

209
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,150
(She's so cute and sweet.)

210
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,480
(We love you, Su Min.)

211
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,550
She's really cute.

212
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,210
She's cute.

213
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,410
(Gary looks proud of her.)

214
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,780
What are you doing?

215
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,980
(Sing along, everyone.)

216
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,180
(She's very pretty and also dances well.)

217
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,350
Who sings this song?

218
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,810
It's Twice's.

219
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,310
(Seok Jin looks overwhelmed.)

220
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,680
- She's nice.
 -  She's a good dancer.

221
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,350
(Did you see that, Seok Jin?)

222
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,580
You're really cute.

223
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,780
(Yes, we won!)

224
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,280
(It seems like they forgot that she's their opponent.)

225
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,050
- She's really talented.
 -  That was so nice.

226
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,610
- She can be in an idol group.
 -  She's so amazing.

227
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,010
- What a treasure.
 -  She knows that she's cute.

228
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,050
She's so cute.

229
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,920
- All right. The next person is...
 -  Just like this.

230
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,110
- the fighter, Kim Dong Hyun.
 -  Yes.

231
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,780
(After Su Min, here comes fighter, Dong Hyun.)

232
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,850
(He's intimidating.)

233
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,010
He looks really strong.

234
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,240
He's an athlete.

235
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,810
- Who brought an athlete here?
 -  He looks really tough.

236
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,480
Jong Kook will have a hard time facing him.

237
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,580
Dong Hyun will keep chasing Jong Kook.

238
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,950
Jong Kook is muscular, but he's strong only on TV.

239
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,350
His muscles are just variety muscles.

240
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,220
- They're for showing off.
 -  So?

241
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,580
- It's not the case for Dong Hyun.
 -  Of course not.

242
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,880
- His muscles are real muscles.
 -  He's...

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,560
- in a different league.
 -  Is that so?

244
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,310
- So, here's Dong Hyun.
 -  Okay.

245
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,650
Our last member is...

246
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,730
- Whose rival is he?
 -  You said we'll show off...

247
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,010
I'm talking right now.

248
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,010
- You told me that...
 -  That's why he's wearing those.

249
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,650
- Dong Hyun will punch these.
 -  They're to take his punches.

250
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,350
I was wondering why you've brought them here.

251
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,650
I heard that Dong Hyun will punch these.

252
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,750
We'll do that after introducing all of us.

253
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,880
Just do as I order. Okay?

254
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,210
(Kicking)

255
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,810
(Gyeong Gyu kicks out of fury.)

256
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,010
He really kicked him.

257
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,250
- You must understand my position.
 -  What position?

258
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,780
Go to your man, Kim Heung Gook, if you want to.

259
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,880
We were supposed to do it.

260
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,560
Go to Heung Gook!

261
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,070
- He's being scolded.
 -  Poor him.

262
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,340
Who's next?

263
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,780
- Have you finished?
 -  No.

264
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,420
You haven't introduced Yoo Jae Hwan to us.

265
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,840
- I'll sing a song.
 -  Really?

266
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,080
- Let's hear his singing.
 -  He's a musician.

267
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,950
- Gyeong Gyu is really funny.
 -  Let's begin.

268
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,210
(Jae Hwan is a songwriter. Is he a talented singer as well?)

269
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,160
(He's quite good.)

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,570
You will rest in my arms

271
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,050
So just like now

272
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,530
- What is that?
 -  What are you doing?

273
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,580
All right. Let's stop here.

274
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,800
- It's early in the morning.
 -  What are you doing?

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,380
It's too early in the morning.

276
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,650
(He doesn't look happy.)

277
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,630
- Come and stand here.
 -  He said, "Stand here."

278
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,450
- It worked well last time.
 -  Stand in front of me.

279
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,950
(Poor Jae Hwan will be punished after singing.)

280
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,160
Stand still.

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,980
(Slapping)

282
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,350
(Gyeong Gyu slaps him using his Jeet Kune Do skills.)

283
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,510
He really hit me.

284
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,650
What was that?

285
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,330
He slapped my face because I made a mistake.

286
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,230
- Poor you.
 -  What was that?

287
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,430
My gosh.

288
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,670
I was slapped because I made a mistake while singing.

289
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,880
(Gyeong Gyu is a really strict leader.)

290
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
He applauds you if you do fine.

291
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,920
- If you fail, you're in trouble.
 -  All right. Who's next?

292
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,480
- There's no one left.
 -  He was the last.

293
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,810
- He wants to finish quickly.
 -  The first part has finished.

294
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,050
(The introduction has finished already.)

295
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,780
(Running Man vs Avengers)

296
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,480
(How will they compete today?)

297
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,180
Please show us the title of the first match.

298
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,580
(The fight between the two teams begins.)

299
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,880
We're starting right away.

300
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,950
Is something coming out?

301
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,350
(What is today's first match?)

302
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,550
- It's "Ssireum".
 -  "Ssireum"?

303
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,010
(Ssireum)

304
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,580
All right. Let's begin the first round.

305
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,710
(1st round starts.)

306
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,550
But this match will be...

307
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,410
Although Jong Kook is really strong,

308
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,850
- his opponent is very strong, too.
 -  That's right.

309
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,850
Although it's just a variety show, they will fight for their pride.

310
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,910
You're right. They are serious.

311
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,410
All right. For the first round,

312
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,680
Lee Kwang Soo will play.

313
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,810
(Kwang Soo is the first player.)

314
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,080
Okay. It's Kwang Soo.

315
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,440
Then his opponent will be...

316
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,010
the farmed Asian black bear.

317
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,310
Kim Joon Hyun.

318
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,510
(Kwang Soo vs Joon Hyun)

319
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,610
All right. Let's go.

320
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,050
- Go, Joon Hyun.
 -  I'll play seriously.

321
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,270
- I'm serious.
 -  You must wear your shoes.

322
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,510
Su Min wants to cheer for Joon Hyun. Can we listen to her cheer?

323
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,290
- Is there a cheer?
 -  Yes, there is.

324
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,380
Our young, fine man, Joon Hyun, will play ssireum today.

325
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,200
Let's cheer for him so he can play better. Shall we?

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,110
- Go, Joon Hyun!
 -  Go, Joon Hyun!

327
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,650
- That's really great.
 -  Ji Hyo.

328
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,000
- Try it.
 -  Ji Hyo, I know you can do it.

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
- Follow her.
 -  Cheer him on, Ji Hyo.

330
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,850
- Just like her.
 -  "Our young Kwang Soo..."

331
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,370
Our young Kwang Soo, I heard that you're playing ssireum today.

332
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,880
- Stop it.
 -  So let's...

333
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,010
(Stop it.)

334
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,800
She sounded like a teacher.

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,340
Kwang Soo, step forward. Joon Hyun, step forward.

336
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,620
He looks like a professional ssireum player. He really does.

337
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,150
- Like this.
 -  Look at his legs.

338
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,510
- Okay.
 -  All right. I'll do my best.

339
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,370
- First round is the most important.
 -  Come forward, please.

340
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,510
- Let's go!
 -  Let's go!

341
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,450
It's the Asian black bear versus the giraffe.

342
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,050
The giraffe is no match for him.

343
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,580
It's the long socks versus the liner socks.

344
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,050
It's the white socks versus black socks.

345
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,280
- The fatty versus the skinny.
 -  The fatty versus the skinny.

346
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
- The fatty... Yes?
 -  Hey, move back.

347
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,050
- Do it over there.
 -  Your thighs are lower than mine.

348
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,310
Don't make this pose in variety shows.

349
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,640
We don't do this. Look at your pose.

350
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,110
Then am I supposed to stand like this?

351
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,110
(He's self-conscious.)

352
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,340
Gyeong Gyu has changed a lot.

353
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,470
Back then, he'd ask, "Who are you to tell me what to do?"

354
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,240
I don't know what to do with my arms now.

355
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
What am I supposed to do with them?

356
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,380
- Do whatever you want.
 -  Act comfortably.

357
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,640
You can do this, then.

358
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,410
- Ready. Take a step back.
 -  Kwang Soo.

359
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,080
- I think Kwang Soo will lose.
 -  Stand up.

360
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,610
- Watch your back.
 -  Give them a round of applause!

361
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,940
- Go!
 -  Let's go!

362
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,410
- You can do it!
 -  You can win!

363
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,380
- Bring your leg back.
 -  Let's do this.

364
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,310
(Joon Hyun has a huge appetite.)

365
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,340
(He has extraordinary strength.)

366
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,510
Bring your leg back.

367
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,980
(Kwang Soo's strong as well.)

368
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,680
(His strength will surprise you.)

369
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,640
(Tall Kwang Soo vs Heavy Joon Hyun)

370
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,340
(Who will win?)

371
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,780
They look so tense.

372
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,540
(The match begins.)

373
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,380
- Kwang Soo's quite strong, too.
 -  He's strong.

374
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,310
- You only need one chance.
 -  Look for the timing.

375
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,910
- One of them is tall...
 -  Kwang Soo's tall.

376
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,180
Are you ready to face embarrassment?

377
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
What?

378
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,910
- I'll embarrass you big time.
 -  What?

379
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,140
- Let's see.
 -  He said, "Let's see."

380
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,970
- What shall I do with this giraffe?
 -  "Let's see."

381
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,580
(Lifting)

382
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,480
(He's startled.)

383
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,080
(He lifts him up.)

384
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
(Wow.)

385
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,780
(He's very strong.)

386
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,800
(Stumbling)

387
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,910
Look at Kwang Soo.

388
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,410
(Spinning)

389
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Stop, Joon Hyun.

390
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,910
This is what Jong Kook does to me.

391
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,010
(Kwang Soo tries to resist.)

392
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,080
(Joon Hyun spins around...)

393
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,810
(and tackles Kwang Soo.)

394
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,010
(Kwang Soo is in trouble.)

395
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
(Tackling)

396
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,080
(Lifting)

397
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,380
(He has powerful strength.)

398
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,180
(Joon Hyun dominates the game.)

399
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,180
(He squishes Kwang Soo.)

400
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,580
What are you going to do now? What's wrong?

401
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
Kwang Soo lost?

402
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,480
- This is humiliating.
 -  Did Kwang Soo lose?

403
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,710
- Don't act up.
 -  Did he really lose?

404
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,780
- Kwang Soo's done.
 -  Kwang Soo, you're strong though.

405
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,380
This is so humiliating.

406
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,940
From what I saw, before Kwang Soo went down,

407
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,610
Joon Hyun's hand touched the ground first, no?

408
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,180
- No, no.
 -  I was afraid I'd squish him.

409
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,080
I see. He would have died if Joon Hyun put his weight on him.

410
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,110
(He easily lifted Kwang Soo off the ground...)

411
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,210
(and gained his victory.)

412
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,960
(He evens used his hands to protect Kwang Soo.)

413
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,640
- I'm surprised that he lost.
 -  Let's go again.

414
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,380
- Let's play another round.
 -  Were you being serious?

415
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,310
- It's 1 to 0.
 -  Can you not beat him?

416
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,380
Anyhow, the first game goes to Joon Hyun!

417
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,640
(Joon Hyun takes the first game.)

418
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,680
- This is not easy.
 -  He's like a professional wrestler.

419
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,630
- The next match is a big one.
 -  All right.

420
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,040
- It's the main match.
 -  Who is it?

421
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,750
It's the main match. Here comes Jong Kook!

422
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,510
(Jong Kook is next!)

423
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,440
- Let's go!
 -  You can do it!

424
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,480
(Jong Kook vs Dong Hyun)

425
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,680
(We trust you, Jong Kook.)

426
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,810
- Let's go, Jong Kook!
 -  Come on!

427
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,580
- Let's do this, Jong Kook!
 -  Hey, hey.

428
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
(He has a slim chance against me.)

429
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,940
- I'm a singer!
 -  You can do it.

430
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,440
- I'm a singer but he's an athlete.
 -  Jong Kook, you...

431
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,640
He feels bad for Jong Kook so he wants to make it look competitive.

432
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,780
- But...
 -  I told him not to bother.

433
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,640
Jong Kook used to do ssireum, too.

434
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,010
He used to do it before.

435
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,380
- Still...
 -  It won't be fun if I win too fast.

436
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,880
(What did you say?)

437
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,580
(Did I hear him correctly?)

438
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,310
- He's making me angry.
 -  He won't go easy on you.

439
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,080
- Do it properly, Jong Kook.
 -  You can do it.

440
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
You can't bring him down. I'm serious.

441
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,980
- This is the main match.
 -  For sure!

442
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,040
- It's a big match.
 -  Oh, gosh.

443
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,110
Jong Kook, it's not embarrassing for you to lose.

444
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,280
- Right! I'm just a singer.
 -  Dong Hyun hasn't retired, yet.

445
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
- He's an athlete.
 -  Right.

446
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,990
I'm pretty new to ssireum though.

447
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,440
You are trained in judo though.

448
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,740
You should be embarrassed if you lose.

449
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,210
- Oh, gosh.
 -  Look at his arms.

450
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,940
I'm getting goose bumps watching them.

451
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,140
Give them a round of applause!

452
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,240
(Will Jong Kook be able to get even with Team Avengers?)

453
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,010
You never know. Dong Hyun might lose.

454
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,240
Jong Kook has played ssireum before.

455
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,700
- This is worth watching.
 -  It's a big match!

456
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,270
- This is great.
 -  Jong Kook can win.

457
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,440
- This is no joke.
 -  He's coming out too strong.

458
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,580
(Dong Hyun's a renowned fighter.)

459
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,610
(He's here to taint Jong Kook's reputation.)

460
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,180
(However, Jong Kook wins every game.)

461
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,810
(He can't lose on home ground.)

462
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,250
(The match begins!)

463
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,140
- This is a big match.
 -  He's strong.

464
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,980
(Jong Kook makes the first attack.)

465
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,780
(He needs to get a head start to win.)

466
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,210
This is a matter of pride.

467
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,850
(He tackles from the inside.)

468
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,810
(Is Dong Hyun falling over?)

469
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,910
(He defends himself.)

470
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,310
(Jong Kook goes at it again.)

471
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,980
- Watch out.
 -  Watch behind you.

472
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,510
- This is really worth watching.
 -  It's amazing.

473
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,440
(Jong Kook isn't an easy opponent to face.)

474
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
They're incredible.

475
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,480
- Didn't his knee touch the ground?
 -  No, no.

476
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,530
- I think it did.
 -  No way.

477
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,270
You really can't tell who'll win.

478
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,410
- You can't tell.
 -  This is so fun to watch.

479
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,940
(I'm a UFC fighter!)

480
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,910
(Is Dong Hyun struggling in a match against a singer?)

481
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,350
(This match is unpredictable.)

482
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,440
(It happened in a flash.)

483
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,910
(Dong Hyun performed a judo move.)

484
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,180
(It was short but intense.)

485
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,680
(Dong Hyun wins.)

486
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,010
Are you okay?

487
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,880
(I'm a singer but why am I so upset?)

488
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,040
(This calls for a celebration.)

489
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,140
I've never seen him lose.

490
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,280
I've never seen this.

491
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,580
(This is a rare match to come across.)

492
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,350
I could see him performing the technique.

493
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,380
- I could see him do it.
 -  Jong Kook was trying to resist,

494
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,540
- but Dong Hyun used it against him.
 -  I didn't know that was from judo.

495
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,000
It was a judo move.

496
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
- He was strong, too.
 -  Right?

497
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
- I should have visited Japan.
 -  I know, right?

498
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,980
Please give them a round of applause.

499
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,480
- Jong Kook, you were the best.
 -  You really were.

500
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,980
- You were amazing.
 -  You almost had him.

501
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,240
We lost the first round.

502
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,010
- But there's more to come.
 -  It's only the first round.

503
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,540
- This is the beginning.
 -  Yes!

504
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,190
(Team Avengers wins the first round.)

505
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,410
The following competition is "Speed Quiz".

506
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,940
- It's a "Speed Quiz".
 -  Excellent.

507
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,180
This one can go either way.

508
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,440
- This one is doable.
 -  We're smart.

509
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,330
All of the members will participate.

510
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,580
One person from each team will wear a mouth gag.

511
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,140
The team that guesses the most words in 100 seconds will win.

512
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,510
You only get three chances to skip a word, so please use them wisely.

513
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,510
All right.

514
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,080
This will make you look like a monkfish.

515
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,310
(Is this how you put it on?)

516
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,640
You only wear it if you're describing a word, right?

517
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,680
- Yes, that's right.
 -  That's right.

518
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
It's only for the person describing the word.

519
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,400
- Each team will pick a theme.
 -  We must not pick a hard one.

520
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
- Go ahead, Seok Jin.
 -  Sure.

521
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,180
Pick something easy.

522
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,640
- He's never lucky.
 -  How would I know?

523
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,080
He's so unlucky. Ji Hyo should have picked it.

524
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
- I picked "Proverbs".
 -  This is the most difficult one.

525
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,710
- I'll describe it in words,
 -  All right.

526
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,850
- so don't worry.
 -  I can't understand him.

527
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,380
Let's go! Let's do this.

528
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,850
- Let's do this.
 -  Let's go!

529
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,480
- Let's win.
 -  Let's go!

530
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,540
Get set.

531
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,710
(Lock the stable door after the horse is stolen.)

532
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,740
There's a horse. It's a horse.

533
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,380
- What's that?
 -  It's a horse.

534
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,010
- It's "sa"?
 -  It's a horse.

535
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,260
A "sa"?

536
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,480
- What's that?
 -  A horse!

537
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,230
- A horse!
 -  "Seo"! What's that?

538
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,080
- A horse!
 -  "Seo"!

539
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,180
(This is fun to watch.)

540
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,710
- A horse!
 -  A horse.

541
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,740
- What comes after it?
 -  Right.

542
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,010
What do you put around it?

543
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,240
- That's it!
 -  Hurry.

544
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,640
- What do you put around it?
 -  Don't you know it?

545
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,220
What's that? A horse...

546
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,040
- Pass.
 -  Come on.

547
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,210
- What is it?
 -  It's a stable door.

548
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,380
- All right, Jong Kook.
 -  "Lock the stable door."

549
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,850
(Be so ignorant as to not know his ABCs.)

550
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,380
"Be so ignorant as to not know his ABCs."

551
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,140
(He guesses it right away.)

552
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
It's so obvious.

553
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,010
- Hey! You're good for nothing.
 -  Was that what it was?

554
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,380
(Try to guess what it is.)

555
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,180
(Incomprehensible)

556
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,680
- That thing.
 -  Kwang Soo.

557
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,710
(What's that?)

558
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,780
(Shouting)

559
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo!

560
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,440
- "One ill word asks another."
 -  Correct!

561
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,780
Why couldn't you get that?

562
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,810
(Rags to riches)

563
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,310
Hey!

564
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,510
It's a stream.

565
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,380
- "Rags to riches"!
 -  Excellent!

566
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,670
(They get 3 in a row.)

567
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,080
- He gave away the answer.
 -  You can hear him well.

568
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,240
(An innocent bystander gets hurt in a fight.)

569
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,260
- He gave away the answer.
 -  You can hear him well.

570
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,700
Hey, listen carefully.

571
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,990
I can't hear him.

572
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,910
The whales are fighting.

573
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,210
"An innocent bystander gets hurt in a fight."

574
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,410
- Correct.
 -  We're doing well. We're fast.

575
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,080
(There may be blue and better blue.)

576
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,780
- "Bad news travels fast!"
 -  No.

577
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,280
There's someone running and another person is above him.

578
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,910
"There may be blue and better blue."

579
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,340
- You're saying the answer.
 -  You can't do that.

580
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,980
- Stop doing that.
 -  I can't guess it right, anyway.

581
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,210
(A pear drops when a crow flies from the tree.)

582
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,610
"A pear drops when a crow flies from the tree."

583
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,280
(So far, they've guessed 6 right.)

584
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,810
(Crowing)

585
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,080
(Cooing)

586
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,540
(What's this supposed to be?)

587
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,040
- The chicken...
 -  No, not that one.

588
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
- That was close.
 -  Okay!

589
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,840
- How many did they get?
 -  What was it?

590
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
(Playing innocent)

591
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,480
"Playing innocent".

592
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,510
(That's what he meant by the noise.)

593
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,740
- "Playing innocent".
 -  It should've been your foot.

594
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,140
- How many was that?
 -  You got six right.

595
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,240
Was that 100 seconds? That's too short.

596
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,410
- That was enough.
 -  Good job.

597
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,380
It looks like he's not wearing anything.

598
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,680
I'll put it on.

599
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,810
(Gyeong Gyu will describe the words.)

600
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,240
- He came for this.
 -  All right.

601
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,340
Jae Seok is working hard and I don't want to be compared to him.

602
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,140
So I'll change my attitude.

603
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,940
This is the topic.

604
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,610
(Team Avengers' theme is "SBS Programmes".)

605
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,840
- Can we ask for help?
 -  I don't think he would know.

606
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
- This is a problem.
 -  Gyeong Gyu...

607
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
doesn't watch television if he's not on it.

608
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,350
- I know them all.
 -  I don't think so.

609
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,480
Let's go!

610
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,440
Go. Go.

612
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,340
(There's a catch phrase in the show.)

613
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,240
However...

614

615
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,110
He looks tired.

616
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,580
"However!"

617
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,580
(You get what I'm saying, right?)

618
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,140
He looks tired.

619
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,480
"However!"

620
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,940
- "The Its Know".
 -  Correct!

621
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,550
- How did she get that right?
 -  I don't even know.

622
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,360
- This one's funny.
 -  He'll never guess it.

623
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
I don't think he knows this one.

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,920

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
He's describing it.

628
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,280
- He's describing it.
 -  It's so hot!

629
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,180
- Your heart is burning.
 -  Yes!

630
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,610
- Kim Gook Jin!
 -  I don't know what this is.

631
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,110
- "Flaming Youth".
 -  Right!

632
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,380
(Sae Ho gets it correct.)

633
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,080
He knew it.

- I'm the best!
 -  Master!

643
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,180
- Hey, Su Min.
 -  What is it?

644
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,080

- Watch me.
 -  Isn't he drunk?

648
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,480

(Running Man)

684
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,180
- Running Man!
 -  Yes!

685
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,740
- That was too easy.
 -  Wasn't that too easy?

686
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,960
(Yelling)

687
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,180
- Let's go!
 -  What was that?

688
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,940
- Was that two?
 -  Is it "Capture the Moment"?

689
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,880
He's so bad at explaining but you still got it right.

690
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
What's this supposed to be?

691
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,210
You got seven right.

692
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,680
(Team Avengers gets 7 right.)

693
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,340
- They got seven right.
 -  That was pretty good.

694
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,380
- Let them be.
 -  Team Avengers takes the win.

695
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,180
Let's do it again.

696
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,480
- That was funny.
 -  That was so close.

697
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,840
- We should play two rounds.
 -  How is this "Fantastic Duo"?

698
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,810
- That's two people.
 -  That was so obvious.

699
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,910
- Let's play another round, then.
 -  Let's do one more round.

700
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,370
- Jae Hwan can go first.
 -  Are we going first?

701
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,860
- The category is "Song Names"!
 -  That's good!

702
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,940
- That's a good one.
 -  Excellent.

703
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,080
- Did you put it on?
 -  Stand here.

704
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,380
It'll be hard to guess.

705
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,980
This won't be easy.

706
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,880
He's a composer though. He must know a lot of songs.

707
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
It's still difficult.

708
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,380
- It's still difficult. See?
 -  Hong Jin Young.

709
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,940
- Hong Jin Young.
 -  Hong Jin Young? "Thumb Up"?

710
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,410
- This one's easy.
 -  "Love Battery"?

711
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,940
- That's it.
 -  Good job.

712
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,410
("What About My Age?")

713
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,040
- Is he drunk?
 -  "What About My Age?"

714
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,310
You have to keep talking.

715
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,440
("Like Being Shot by a Bullet")

716
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,980
(Don't you recognise this melody?)

717
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,310
- What's that?
 -  Act it out.

718
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,510
- You have to act it out.
 -  Act it out.

719
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,040
(What's that?)

720
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
It's this.

721
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,940
I know. "You Get Shot".

722
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,820
"You Get Shot"?

723
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,170
- A bullet?
 -  What comes after that?

724
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,810
- Something comes after it.
 -  That part's over.

725
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,680
- That's done.
 -  You get shot.

726
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,810
- There's more.
 -  "After You Get Shot"!

727
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,740
- You can do it.
 -  Just pass.

728
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
(It must be a new song.)

729
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,210
- Yes!
 -  This game's over.

730
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,110
- This is done.
 -  "Like Being Shot by a Bullet"!

731
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,340
"Like Being Shot by a Bullet"!

732
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,710
(He finally guesses it correctly.)

733
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,010
Okay.

734
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,480
How did you get it?

735
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
("Me Gustas Tu")

736
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,640
(He sings the melody perfectly even with the mouth gag.)

737
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,140
- "Me Gustas Tu".
 -  Okay!

738
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,910
("Me Gustas Tu")

739
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,140
(I won't fail the team again.)

740
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,080
(It's a popular song by Twice.)

741
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,740
(Floundering)

742
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,740
(It doesn't sound like the same song.)

743
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,780
- He doesn't know it.
 -  I sang it in the beginning.

744
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,410
- It's done.
 -  What's that?

745
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
- Look at him.
 -  Pass.

746
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,210
- What's that?
 -  It's done. It's over.

747
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,560
- It's done.
 -  Hey, hey.

748
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,610
("Cheer Up")

749
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,840
- He's thinking so hard.
 -  Pass.

750
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,740
Fighters don't have to know it.

751
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,040
(His only interest is in UFC.)

752
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,880
How are you supposed to guess, anyway?

753
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,810
("I Miss You")

754
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,340
He doesn't get it.

755
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,820
- He looks so confused.
 -  I miss you.

756
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,180
Missing you. "I Miss You".

757
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,040
I miss you to death

758
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,240
"My Goodness"?

759
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,050
"I Miss You."

760
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,410
Time's up.

761
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,040
Jae Hwan can't do better than this.

762
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,740
- Good job.
 -  You were good.

763
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,010
Kwang Soo!

764
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,740
(It's Team Running Man's turn.)

765
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,440
(Their team is "Korean Movies".)

766
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
All right! Let's go!

767
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,140
- It might be hard.
 -  Let's go!

768
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,440
- Come on, Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo!

769
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,110
- He's an actor.
 -  He knows it well.

770
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,680
("Veteran")

771
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
What are you saying?

772
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,640
That's nonsense.

773
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,120
(This is the catch phrase.)

774
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,660
"That's nonsense."

775
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,710
- It's not bad.
 -  What did you say?

776
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,440
- "That's nonsense."
 -  Pardon?

777
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,480
- You know it.
 -  "Veteran"!

778
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,980
- How did he guess that?
 -  What was it?

779
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,840
- "That's nonsense."
 -  "That's nonsense."

780
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,540
(Approaching)

781
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,310
(What's this?)

782
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,740
(How do I explain this?)

783
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,980
It's Gianna Jun.

784
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,640
There's Gianna Jun and Cho Jin Woong.

785
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,840
- Right.
 -  Ha Jung Woo's in it.

786
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,540
Right.

787
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,940
- Oh, that.
 -  There's a twin!

788
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,610
- Hey, hey!
 -  I get it.

789
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,580
Gianna is a twin.

790
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,440
Jin Woong gets shot.

791
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,330
- You're supposed to do this.
 -  He's so detailed.

792
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,380
(Isn't this obvious?)

793
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,310
(This is a scene from "Assassination".)

794
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,580
Sir.

795
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,010
(Don't you know this?)

796
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,000
Come on. Don't you know this? Try to guess.

797
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,940
Jin Woong gets shot...

798
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,780
and goes down.

799
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,280
- Look at his face.
 -  Come on!

800
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,410
- He's doing it right.
 -  Isn't that a zombie?

801
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,390
Ji Hyun's a twin.

802
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,610
A twin!

803
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,780
- Pass.
 -  He didn't watch it.

804
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,170
- Oh, come on.
 -  Come on.

805
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,910
- Continue.
 -  Do this.

806
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,140
"Shoot me and go."

807
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,910
Shoot me and go.

808
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,080
(It's Ahn Sung Ki's quote from "Silmido".)

809
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,000
- "Shoot me and go."
 -  This is it.

810
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,280
- Shoot! Me! And go!
 -  You have to get this one!

811
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,180
- Follow me?
 -  You should get this right.

812
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
- "Shoot me and go."
 -  You got it right last week.

813
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,440
"Shoot me and go."

814
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,710
- It's "Silmido"!
 -  You're drooling, Kwang Soo.

815
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,510
- "Silmido"!
 -  Correct.

816
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,410
- Shouldn't he wipe his mouth?
 -  Keep going.

817
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,710
("King and the Clown")

818
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,210
This is great!

819
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,780
- Good one.
 -  I know this one.

820
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:45,310
(This is a scene from "King and the Clown".)

821
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,880
(Fluttering)

822
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,780
- Good one.
 -  I know this one.

823
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,710
(Let's wipe your mouth first.)

824
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,340
- What's that supposed to be?
 -  I'm okay.

825
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,110
- What's that supposed to be?
 -  I'm okay.

826
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,040
("King and the Clown")

827
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,910
- "King and the Clown"!
 -  Correct!

828
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,040
- Okay, all right.
 -  Let's make it four.

829
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,080
Okay.

830
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,940
Why would you do that?

831
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,410
- How many was that?
 -  "Shoot me and go."

832
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,410
- Let me announce the results.
 -  Did we lose?

833
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,730
Team Avengers wins.

834
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,810
(Team Avengers wins.)

835
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,710
- That's fine.
 -  We'll win next time.

836
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,210
(Will Team Running Man make a comeback?)

837
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,990
- We'll win in the next round.
 -  Okay!

838
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,480
(Team Avengers wins the first round.)

839
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,840
(It's lunch time.)

840
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,280
(There are two tables.)

841
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,980
- My goodness.
 -  Oh, my.

842
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,730
(A feast is prepared for the winners, Team Avengers.)

843
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,230
No, no.

844
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,610
(There are plentiful dishes full of meat, seafood and vegetables.)

845
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,910
- It's budaejjigae.
 -  Sit on either side.

846
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,680
(The losers get gimbap and a drink.)

847
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,980
- Can we eat?
 -  I'm not on a diet.

848
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,660
- Hold on.
 -  Thank you.

849
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,240
(Simmering)

850
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,340
Joon Hyun is filming "Baek Jong Won's Top 3 Chef King".

851
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,610
(Joon Hyun gets ready to enjoy the meal.)

852
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,710
That looks so tasty.

853
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,710
- It's really delicious.
 -  You're like a cook.

854
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,430
That's budaejjigae.

855
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,210
I really want budaejjigae, too.

856
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,830
That looks so good.

857
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,120
He put ramyeon in it.

858
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,970
Gosh, look at him.

859
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,440
He's going to eat now.

860
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
Isn't it too early to eat the ramyeon?

861
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,910
Ramyeon for budaejjigae must be firm.

862
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,600
- Right.
 -  Right.

863
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,610
- I prefer firm noodles, too.
 -  You're so right.

864
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
My goodness.

865
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,780
That looks so good.

866
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,880
Show us how to eat noodles deliciously.

867
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,510
Do you want me to?

868
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,680
- Gosh.
 -  Eat it.

869
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,240
It's so lovely.

870
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,940
(He slurps the ramyeon.)

871
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,180
Oh, my.

872
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,840
(He inhales ramyeon like a black hole.)

873
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,010
Wow, it looks so good.

874
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,300
He inhaled it all.

875
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,410
Please stop eating.

876
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,110
(He fills his stomach with water.)

877
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,280
Gyeong Gyu might not remember this.

878
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,310
It happened a long time ago. It just came to my mind.

879
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,980
One day, I ran into him. So I was going to say hello.

880
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,180
But he said, "Don't say hello," and walked away.

881
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,380
(Did I say that?)

882
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,140
My goodness.

883
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,140
I was really surprised.

884
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,650
- "Don't say hello to me."
 -  I got something to tell you.

885
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,610
A long time ago,

886
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,810
I met Gyeong Gyu at a karaoke and joined him.

887
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,920
He was an idol to all comedians.

888
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,600
So I said, "Hello. I'm a rookie comedian, Jee Seok Jin".

889
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,840
And he said, "I don't know you."

890
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,980
And for about two hours,

891
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,680
he didn't even look at me.

892
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,780
I'm sure that he doesn't remember that day.

893
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,340
Do you remember?

894
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,610
(Running Man vs Avengers, the second mission)

895
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,780
In the second round, you'll play "Variety Football".

896
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,940
("Variety Football")

897
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,980
We'll provide each team with the same seven items.

898
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,160
You'll wear the items and play football.

899
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,070
The team that scores the most wins.

900
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,810
We've invited a special referee for fair judgement.

901
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,280
(A special referee is here to make fair judgement.)

902
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,780
(A special referee?)

903
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,090
(Who is it?)

904
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,320
Oh, it's you!

905
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,980
(Football mania Kim Heung Gook)

906
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,210
Hello!

907
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,210
(Welcome to Running Man.)

908
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,140
(Here comes the variety dark horse.)

909
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,580
Heung Gook is here!

910
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,680
He's like my father.

911
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
Hello.

912
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
- "Gosh, it was fun."
 -  "Gosh, it was fun."

913
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,140
I never thought you'd be with us today.

914
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,710
I'm a rising variety star.

915
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,180
(He spared his time for Running Man.)

916
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,350
So you have other plans after this, right?

917
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,440
I have other plans.

918
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,110
I have to go to a radio studio.

919
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,250
What time do you have to leave?

920
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,480
I'll leave in 30 minutes.

921
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,510
(This cool guy is not in the same class as others.)

922
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,180
Each half will take 15 minutes.

923
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,810
So I'll leave right after the game.

924
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,610
You'll leave immediately after the game?

925
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,920
Even Gyeong Gyu hoped to go home before dinner.

926
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,970
- Wow.
 -  What's important here is...

927
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,940
I will leave with everyone. But he'll leave by himself.

928
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,810
(It's Heung Gook's style.)

929
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,310
My goodness.

930
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,410
(Special commentators are also here.)

931
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,940
We have commentators for our football game.

932
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,140
Such prominent commentators came for us?

933
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,880
Please welcome Anchor Bae Seong Jae and Commentator Park Moon Sung.

934
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,920
Wow! Hello!

935
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,360
- Great.
 -  Let's warm up.

936
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
- Let's begin.
 -  Okay.

937
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,610
Please get changed.

938
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,090
- My goodness.
 -  Do you know how to block goals?

939
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,310
Just stand there.

940
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,710
Gosh, it must be really hot.

941
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,480
Look at his fur coat.

942
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,810
He makes me feel hot as well.

943
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,580
Who will be the goalkeeper?

944
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,810
(Struggling)

945
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,040
I think I should put this on.

946
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,610
No, don't. Choose this one instead.

947
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,750
- Ji Hyo, wear this bee costume.
 -  Okay.

948
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,840
I need to put balloons in it.

949
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,510
(Ji Hyo becomes agile in the bee costume.)

950
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,910
(Kwang Soo wears a big drum on his back.)

951
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,810
Hello, everyone. The second round will begin soon.

952
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,490
It's called "Variety Football".

953
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,750
Team Running Man will fight against Team Avengers.

954
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,610
(Each team has 5 players and each half takes 15 minutes.)

955
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,330
Each team has seven players.

956
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,110
But only five players can play on the ground.

957
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,980
The players are wearing different items and costumes.

958
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,530
- They're given items.
 -  Right.

959
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,340
Who do you think is a key player today?

960
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,810
In my opinion,

961
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,750
Jong Gook of Team Running Man has great stamina.

962
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,250
- In Team Avengers,

963
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,210
- I feel like it'll be Sae Ho.
 -  Sae Ho?

964
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,600
- Right.
 -  He's wearing flippers.

965
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,810
(He's just a fashion terrorist.)

966
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,810
Anyway, the oldest players in both teams are excluded...

967
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,570
from the starting line-ups.

968
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,140
- Go for it!
 -  You can do it!

969
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,680
(They strategically excluded the oldest members.)

970
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,780
Let's win!

971
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,250
(Finally, the players are on the field.)

972
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,840
(Let's go for it!)

973
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
- Yes!
 -  Kwang Soo.

974
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,080
The first half will take 15 minutes.

975
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,980
(The first half begins.)

976
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,010
(Jung Jin passes the ball to Sae Ho right after the game begins.)

977
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,110
The match has just begun.

978
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,040
We must win!

979
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,450
(Waddling)

980
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,510
Sae Ho uses his flippers to touch the ball.

981
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,600
The players with flippers collided.

982
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,480
Now, the players in bee costumes are running around.

983
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,680
They are cute.

984
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,230
(It doesn't look like a football game from above.)

985
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,780
(Gosh, what on earth is this?)

986
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,140
(There are only variety characters on the ground.)

987
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,410
Pass the ball!

988
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,680
No. No way!

989
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,780
Hey, take it easy. Run slowly!

990
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,210
You should save your energy!

991
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,880
Good. That's it.

992
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
No!

993
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,940
Gosh, wait. Wait!

994
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,610
(They can strategically use their items.)

995
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,980
- No way!
 -  No!

996
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,110
It's right there.

997
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,480
I can't see anything!

998
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,310
(Sae Ho is wearing a fur coat as if he's in Siberia.)

999
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,750
Where is the ball?

1000
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,540
(Thanks to the items, it's nothing but chaos.)

1001
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,910
Great! Go!

1002
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,170
(Joon Hyun falls by himself.)

1003
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,580
- Gosh, it's not easy.
 -  Hey!

1004
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,810
Where is the ball?

1005
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,340
Gosh, help me!

1006
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,640
Gosh, help me!

1007
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,750
Help me get up.

1008
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,840
(This Asian black bear finds it hard to get up by himself.)

1009
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,640
(Jae Hwan helps him stand up...)

1010
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,180
(but falls instead.)

1011
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,080
(They're Dumb and Dumber.)

1012
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,280
Where is it? Where's the ball?

1013
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,140
Is this really a football game?

1014
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,840
This is even more chaotic from the beginning...

1015
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,680
than we had expected.

1016
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,480
- Go!
 -  Good.

1017
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,540
(Team Running Man starts to move forward.)

1018
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,440
Gosh, why did you pass the ball there?

1019
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,440
(They fumble and fall down.)

1020
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,410
(Thanks to the items, it's taking them more energy.)

1021
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,030
- Each half will take 15 minutes.
 -  Yes.

1022
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,930
But I'm not sure if they will have enough energy for that.

1023
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,680
Just shoot, Jong Kook!

1024
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,750
Go! Now!

1025
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,910
I can't see anything.

1026
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,690
Oh, no! No!

1027
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,880
- I can't see.
 -  Get the ball.

1028
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,210
- Gosh.
 -  Where's the ball?

1029
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,510
Oh, my. I can't see the ball!

1030
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,310
(Kwang Soo kicks the ball.)

1031
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,080
(He passes the ball to Sae Ho in the front line.)

1032
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,070
(Finally, it's looking like a real match.)

1033
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,980
(It's Sae Ho's chance.)

1034
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,910
(Sae Ho vs Haha. It's a confrontation.)

1035
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,540
(Sae Ho, please!)

1036
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,440
(Sae Ho kicks.)

1037
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,610
(He misses his golden chance!)

1038
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,640
(And he falls down.)

1039
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,440
- No!
 -  Are you okay?

1040
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,710
Gosh, he missed his chance.

1041
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,750
(Disappointed)

1042
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,140
It was a nice try.

1043
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,780
The pass was made at the right time. And he received the ball well.

1044
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,340
But there's no off-side rule here, apparently.

1045
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,180
I think the referee didn't notice Sae Ho's position.

1046
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,430
- Come in.
 -  Okay.

1047
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,680
Resume the game!

1048
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
Good!

1049
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,180
Great. Kwang Soo, it's a chance!

1050
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,610
(Kwang Soo successfully receives the ball.)

1051
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,950
Block him!

1052
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,480
Go block him.

1053
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,510
(He passes the ball to Ji Hyo in the front line.)

1054
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,120
(There is no one in front of Ji Hyo.)

1055
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,310
Hey, help me get up. Help me.

1056
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,750
(Team Avengers faces a crisis.)

1057
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,010
- Shoot!
 -  Good. That's good.

1058
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,380
(Please help me.)

1059
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,180
(Kwang Soo jumps in...)

1060
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,510
(and obstructs Ji Hyo's way.)

1061
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,310
(He blocked!)

1062
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,300
(Wait!)

1063
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,080
- Shoot!
 -  Goal!

1064
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,470
(Jae Seok makes a goal.)

1065
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,280
- Wow, he made it.
 -  He made a goal.

1066
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,590
Jae Seok just made a goal.

1067
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,210
Jae Seok scored the first goal.

1068
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,410
Team Running Man leads the game 1 to 0.

1069
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,510
(1:0)

1070
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,910
(Jae Seok screams out of joy.)

1071
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,040
(He hugs Seok Jin.)

1072
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,140
(He's overwhelmed with joy.)

1073
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,210
Great job!

1074
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,710
(I can't believe it!)

1075
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,710
Wow!

1076
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,880
I thought it'd be hard to make a goal.

1077
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
The goalkeeper made a small mistake.

1078
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,260
The ball rolled to the side, but his position was great.

1079
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,010
The goalkeeper Joon Hyun blocked the ball.

1080
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,510
But the block unintentionally assisted Jae Seok.

1081
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,340
(Jae Seok receives the honour of putting in the first goal.)

1082
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,280
(His concentration on the game helped him make a goal.)

1083
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,880
Our team players are doing great since we played football before.

1084
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,140
That's true. They're good.

1085
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,080
All right. The score is 1 to 0.

1086
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,490
Now, Team Avengers must make a goal.

1087
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,410
(Team Avengers should keep it up.)

1088
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,610
(Jung Jin passes the ball to Su Min.)

1089
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,140
(And Su Min passes the ball to Sae Ho.)

1090
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,940
- Good.
 -  Move forward!

1091
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,040
(Frustrated)

1092
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,940
Move forward!

1093
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,380
(Sae Ho dribbles the ball again.)

1094
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,440
(He falls down.)

1095
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,080
(Fumbling)

1096
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
(He stumbles and falls.)

1097
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,510
(The referee blows the whistle.)

1098
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,350
(Sae Ho, that was dynamic.)

1099
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,540
Gosh, referee!

1100
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,280
It's my bag, not me.

1101
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,510
(Jong Gook's bag made the foul.)

1102
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,050
It was my bag.

1103
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,180
He received a yellow card.

1104
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,080
(Jong Gook gets a yellow card.)

1105
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,310
I think Heung Gook is especially favourable to Sae Ho.

1106
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,410
Panel!

1107
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,340
- Panel?
 -  It means a penalty kick.

1108
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,560
- What?
 -  Just do as I say!

1109
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,210
That's nonsense.

1110
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,290
You can't give them a penalty kick.

1111
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,120
Excuse me, I said just do as I say.

1112
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,950
How can you give them a penalty kick here?

1113
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,070
If I say it's a penalty kick, it's a penalty kick!

1114
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,110
A penalty kick?

1115
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,110
(Astounded)

1116
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,410
The referee just said, "Do as I say".

1117
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,380
- Guys.
 -  That's not fair.

1118
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,010
If you make a foul to Sae Ho, they will get a penalty kick.

1119
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,110
- Here we go!
 -  So don't do it to Sae Ho.

1120
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,910
(Jung Jin takes the penalty kick.)

1121
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,640
- Okay!
 -  Jung Jin!

1122
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,180
(He loses his chance to score.)

1123
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,600
- What's wrong with him?
 -  What did he just do?

1124
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,540
It's okay.

1125
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,140
- Let's go.
 -  Run!

1126
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,280
(5 minutes remain in the first half.)

1127
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,440
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

1128
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,510
Kwang Soo!

1129
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,910
- Kwang Soo's doing well.
 -  Good job! Nice pass!

1130
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,940
- I need to block it.
 -  Kwang Soo!

1131
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,140
I need to block it. I need to block it.

1132
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,640
- I need to block it.
 -  Kwang Soo!

1133
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
(It's a 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper.)

1134
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,380
Goal!

1135
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,710
- Kwang Soo shoots!
 -  It went in!

1136
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,210
It's 2 to 0. Team Running Man scored another goal.

1137
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,310
By the way, he scored the goal very well.

1138
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,780
(He's trying to get up.)

1139
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,840
(We're losing.)

1140
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,510
- We're really good.
 -  We're very good.

1141
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,320
We've been playing football for five years.

1142
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,850
Exchange.

1143
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,540
(This won't do!)

1144
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,170
Dong Hyun joined the game. And Gyeong Gyu is...

1145
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,610
- warming up.
 -  Okay. Play!

1146
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,880
Go! Shoot!

1147
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
Wait! Wait!

1148
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,040
Wait!

1149
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,640
- Shoot!
 -  Shoot!

1150
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,780
- Shoot!
 -  Nice!

1151
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,270
- Shoot!
 -  Nice!

1152
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,340
(The ball hits the post.)

1153
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,640
(He was close!)

1154
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,580
(His strong kick shocks the opponents.)

1155
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,840
- He's good.
 -  Gosh...

1156
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,040
Nice! Nice!

1157
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,110
It's not easy to kick the ball high while wearing three tubes.

1158
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,140
(Dong Hyun changes the vibe of the game!)

1159
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,780
- Shoot!
 -  Go!

1160
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,080
(That was a nice pass.)

1161
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,480
(He runs across the field.)

1162
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,010
Sae Ho shoots!

1163
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,140
(He fails.)

1164
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,400
(Haha blocks the ball.)

1165
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,530
(However!)

1166
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,810
That's too bad. Jung Jin!

1167
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,580
- Shoot!
 -  Sae Ho played defence.

1168
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,880
(Did Sae Ho just block his own team's ball?)

1169
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,920
(Why on earth did you do that?)

1170
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,610
You're so good.

1171
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,670
(Their own team is their worst enemy.)

1172
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,180
Pass, pass.

1173
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,110
(Jong Kook counter-attacks.)

1174
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,740
(He's very agile.)

1175
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,380
Kwang Soo!

1176
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,710
- Don't move.
 -  Where is it?

1177
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,010
I can't see well.

1178
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,680
(Kwang Soo enters, but Dong Hyun stops him right away.)

1179
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,280
He's even defending.

1180
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,740
- Cho Sae Ho! Cho Sae Ho!
 -  The play is...

1181
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,980
- Cho Sae Ho!
 -  Sae Ho!

1182
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,880
(Will Sae Ho succeed this time?)

1183
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,420
(I will make sure to score a goal this time!)

1184
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,140
- Cho Sae Ho!
 -  Sae Ho!

1185
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,410
He fakes it and shoots!

1186
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,910
(He fails.)

1187
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,940
I can't believe he failed to score that.

1188
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,380
Cho Sae Ho!

1189
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,680
(Don't cry, idiot.)

1190
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,740
(Because of the talented goalkeeper Haha, Sae Ho fails every time.)

1191
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,340
Good job, Haha!

1192
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,000
The game resumes.

1193
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,640
- Here we go!
 -  It's hot.

1194
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,740
(Gyeong Gyu ambitiously does a corner kick.)

1195
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Nice pass.

1196
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,240
Dong Hyun shoots. Goal!

1197
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,040
(The ball went right into the goalpost.)

1198
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,110
Bravo!

1199
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,510
(You are the best!)

1200
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,040
Dong Hyun scores the goal!

1201
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,740
Team Avengers scored the first goal, and now the score is 2 to 1.

1202
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,040
By the way, Dong Hyun is really good.

1203
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,480
- I know.
 -  Yes.

1204
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,010
(The current score is 2 to 1.)

1205
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,140
- One more time!
 -  You're good.

1206
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,800
One more time, Gary!

1207
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,610
(Dong Hyun blocks again.)

1208
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:29,980
- Come on!
 -  That's it.

1209
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,210
Come on!

1210
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,880
- Cho Sae Ho.
 -  Cho Sae Ho is good.

1211
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,480
- They are the only ones.
 -  Gyeong Gyu is with him.

1212
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,740
(Sae Ho passes to Gyeong Gyu.)

1213
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,340
He passes the ball to Gyeong Gyu. Gyeong Gyu!

1214
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,780
He scores another goal.

1215
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,840
(He shoots without any hesitation.)

1216
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,610
(Gyeong Gyu ends up scoring a goal.)

1217
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,810
(He does a kissing ceremony.)

1218
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,480
It's as if Sae Ho gave him the chance.

1219
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,580
(Gyeong Gyu and Sae Ho showed amazing teamwork.)

1220
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
Time out!

1221
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,810
Time out.

1222
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,140
(The current score is 2 to 2.)

1223
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,140
Who put you into the fire?

1224
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,410
(He's drenched in sweat.)

1225
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,310
If I score just two more goals, it'll be a hat-trick. Support me.

1226
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,340
Let's drink water, Sae Ho.

1227
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,880
Drink some water, Sae Ho.

1228
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,040
(Running Man members are exhausted as well.)

1229
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,440
(He gulps down water.)

1230
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,240
You're doing much better than before.

1231
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,420
- Much better, right? I'll do it.
 -  We have to do better.

1232
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,380
Gary and Seok Jin can join the second half.

1233
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,270
You can rest for a while.

1234
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,480
That's really...

1235
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,360
We will start the second half.

1236
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,710
The referee is busy. So hurry up and come on out.

1237
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
We must win!

1238
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,840
If we lose here, we will lose completely!

1239
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,110
- You have to win!
 -  We have to win here!

1240
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,780
We have a tie!

1241
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,040
(The second half begins.)

1242
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,040
Go, team!

1243
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,380
- Gosh...
 -  Gary!

1244
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,830
Jae Seok is running fast. You hear the sound, right?

1245
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,010
- Listen to the sound of his drum.
 -  He's fast.

1246
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,040
Jong Kook.

1247
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,440
Jong Kook is good at side plays. He passes to Seok Jin!

1248
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,840
The ball is passed. Shoot!

1249
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,110
(Su Min blocks the ball.)

1250
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,980
- It didn't go in!
 -  She blocked it with her foot.

1251
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,710
The goalkeeper defended well!

1252
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,610
Su Min is really good at goalkeeping.

1253
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,780
What is it that she can't do?

1254
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,280
(Flattered)

1255
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,980
Come on!

1256
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,150
That's good!

1257
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,840
You can do it!

1258
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,510
(That was a nice pass.)

1259
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,080
Gary!

1260
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,510
(I will show you my fancy footwork!)

1261
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,790
Dong Hyun comes to help.

1262
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,940
(It's a back heel turn.)

1263
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,610
- That was a nice turn.
 -  It was a back heel turn.

1264
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,380
Gyeong Gyu is really good at playing football.

1265
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
(Running)

1266
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:03,390
His techniques are strange, but he's good!

1267
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,610
Hey!

1268
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,040
(He gets upset.)

1269
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,770
(Please cut me some slack.)

1270
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,080
Foul. Jae Seok, you committed a foul.

1271
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,120
- It wasn't me!
 -  You committed a foul.

1272
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,540
- It wasn't me.
 -  Your body...

1273
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,740
Your bodies didn't touch, but your drums did.

1274
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,580
We never touched.

1275
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,740
- We barely touched.
 -  What is he doing?

1276
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,340
- We barely...
 -  What are you doing?

1277
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,990
- You're exaggerating.
 -  He is!

1278
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,810
You keep bothering my work.

1279
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,340
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1280
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,380
Keep this.

1281
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,610
- Fine.
 -  You deserve it.

1282
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,840
Okay. Play.

1283
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,180
You will only be able to kick this way.

1284
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,780
(It's Joon Hyun's free kick.)

1285
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,800
- It's not going in.
 -  It's not.

1286
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,280
- Good job.
 -  Good job.

1287
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,280
Behind you, Jae Seok! Great!

1288
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,840
- Go. Go. Go.
 -  It looks like earrings.

1289
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,580
You can give it to Jong Kook.

1290
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,080
You can give it to him.

1291
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,140
- Go, team!
 -  Kwang Soo. Shoot!

1292
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,940
She blocked it again.

1293
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,040
(She blocks it one more time.)

1294
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,840
She blocks well. Really well.

1295
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,060
She blocks really well.

1296
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,790
Please score one more.

1297
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,210
Shoot!

1298
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,960
(She's an unbeatable goalkeeper.)

1299
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,140
- She blocked it again.
 -  Su Min did it for the third time!

1300
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,280
- Jong Kook has the ball again.
 -  Let's do it again.

1301
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,760
- You can do it!
 -  You can do it!

1302
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,910
- Hurry! Hurry!
 -  Why?

1303
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:29,840
- There you go.
 -  He uses the chance.

1304
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,540
- Go!
 -  It went in.

1305
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,040
(How dare you!)

1306
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,440
(And their second chance comes right after.)

1307
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,860
(Kicking)

1308
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,110
Go!

1309
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,310
(She throws herself to defend the goalpost.)

1310
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,480
Shoot again!

1311
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,310
- She's unbelievable.
 -  She's amazing.

1312
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,820
(She's amazing.)

1313
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,290
She's a good goalkeeper!

1314
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,880
She's really good.

1315
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,540
The fun part...

1316
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,180
about this game is watching Su Min.

1317
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,040
Jong Kook is directing the players.

1318
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,980
- He's good.
 -  I can't see the ball!

1319
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,740
(Gosh!)

1320
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,500
- He got poked.
 -  How can they do this?

1321
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,740
They committed a foul.

1322
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,980
Penalty kick.

1323
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,980
(Su Min is in danger.)

1324
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,140
- Do well.
 -  Here we go!

1325
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,740
Shoot! The ball goes in!

1326
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,340
Team Running Man is winning with a score of 3 to 2.

1327
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,010
It's a Pele Score.

1328
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,030
You're too mean to a middle school girl.

1329
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,740
She's only in middle school!

1330
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,380
(3 minutes remain.)

1331
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,510
- Watch the left side.
 -  Concentrate!

1332
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,580
(Team Avengers pass the ball to the back.)

1333
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,610
(The ball flies.)

1334
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,740
(And it hits the goalpost.)

1335
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,180
Shoot!

1336
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,380
Perfect.

1337
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,270
Sae Ho has the second ball!

1338
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,580
- I can't see anything.
 -  Block it, Kwang Soo. Nice.

1339
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,380
Concentrate, concentrate.

1340
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,040
Sae Ho shoots the ball!

1341
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,540
Jung Jin shoots the ball! It's a tie.

1342
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,280
(He calmly finishes the game again.)

1343
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,310
(Jung Jin and Sae Ho did it!)

1344
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,880
Jung Jin recovered it right away and the score is 3 to 3.

1345
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,710
This is really fun.

1346
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,810
Yes.

1347
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,480
Sae Ho and Jung Jin's teamwork was amazing.

1348
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,440
Sae Ho kicks the ball well.

1349
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,680
(It's a tie once again.)

1350
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,440
Play!

1351
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,480
You have one last goal to make!

1352
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,680
(A moment's decision determines the result.)

1353
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,540
(Looking)

1354
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,240
- Hey!
 -  We got it.

1355
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,010
(He passes the ball to Seok Jin.)

1356
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,300
(The ball crosses the field.)

1357
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,880
- Hurry!
 -  Take it slow!

1358
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,340
- That's it!
 -  Kwang Soo, you have to score!

1359
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,260
- Shoot!
 -  Score it.

1360
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,940
Try it again.

1361
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,080
(Su Min and Gyeong Gyu defend vigorously.)

1362
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,280
- It went out.
 -  Try it again.

1363
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,940
- Seok Jin?
 -  It's a mess.

1364
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,640
Seok Jin fell.

1365
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,210
- Go, team!
 -  Let's go!

1366
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,240
(The goalpost is open.)

1367
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,740
Gyeong Gyu fell down! Shoot the ball now!

1368
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,460
- Shoot!
 -  Shoot it!

1369
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,380
- No! You have to score it!
 -  Right now!

1370
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,380
Shoot!

1371
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,410
(The ball rolls out.)

1372
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,430
Shoot.

1373
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,440
(Jong Kook takes a shot.)

1374
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,440
- Hurry up and shoot the ball!
 -  Shoot it!

1375
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,580
(The ball goes in perfectly.)

1376
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,540
(You're the best, Jong Kook!)

1377
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,840
Shoot! The ball goes in.

1378
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,080
- He did well.
 -  He's amazing.

1379
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,850
Jong Kook scored the 4th goal. Now the score is 4 to 3.

1380
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,840
He did really well.

1381
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,440
Gyeong Gyu fell with the bag.

1382
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,010
So he made the ball pass above Gyeong Gyu.

1383
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,610
(You're unbelievable, Jong Kook.)

1384
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,010
Come on.

1385
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,340
(The game ends with a score of 4 to 3.)

1386
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,410
- Is it a tie?
 -  We won.

1387
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,010
- We won by one point.
 -  Good job.

1388
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,740
(Everyone was on the edge of their seats.)

1389
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,780
The game ended.

1390
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,110
Today was Running Man's "Variety Football",

1391
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,820
and Team Running Man won with a score of 4 to 3.

1392
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,540
Who's the best player today?

1393
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,910
I would say it was Jong Kook.

1394
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,910
- He scored the goals well.
 -  Right.

1395
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,180
Team Running Man wins the second round.

1396
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,510
(Team Running Man wins "Variety Football"!)

1397
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Gosh.

1398
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,410
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1399
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,140
- Is he leaving?
 -  Yes.

1400
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,980
- Are you going home now?
 -  Are you leaving?

1401
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,290
Are you leaving?

1402
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,480
It's been fun. I'll be going now.

1403
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,310
- "It's been fun."
 -  "It's been fun."

1404
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,440
(Laughing)

1405
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,610
"It's been fun."

1406
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,010
(He tosses and catches the water bottle.)

1407
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,510
He's funny.

1408
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,540
- We will move to another area.
 -  Okay.

1409
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,680
- Good job, everybody.
 -  Good job.

1410
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,910
(The current score is 1 to 1.)

1411
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,480
- What is this?
 -  This is the real deal.

1412
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,340
(The last match will determine the winning team.)

1413
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,080
This is...

1414
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,340
Go in.

1415
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,880
(What will be the final match?)

1416
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,340
(Why are they here again?)

1417
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,210
- You're here.
 -  You're here.

1418
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,140
- Please.
 -  It's big.

1419
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,410
- The ring is huge.
 -  It's huge.

1420
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,410
- The ring...
 -  The last game is...

1421
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,680
(Falling)

1422
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,480
- What's wrong?
 -  What are you doing, Jae Hwan?

1423
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,910
(He falls on his stomach.)

1424
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,640
- What did you do?
 -  What's wrong?

1425
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,290
I didn't do anything.

1426
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,010
This is the third and last round of Running Man vs Avengers.

1427
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,130
What is it?

1428
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,010
The current score is 1 to 1.

1429
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,240
- Yes.
 -  It's a tie.

1430
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,740
The winner of this round becomes the final winner.

1431
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,130
We must win.

1432
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,400
Let's win!

1433
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,540
The third round is...

1434
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,280
"Running Rumble".

1435
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,180
- "Running Rumble"?
 -  A rumble?

1436
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,370
(I've never heard of this game before.)

1437
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:04,810
First, each team will decide...

1438
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,280
the order of the players' entrance to the ring.

1439
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,610
Once the first two players enter the ring,

1440
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,630
- Name Tag Elimination will begin.
 -  Name Tag Elimination?

1441
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,980
And the 60-second countdown will start.

1442
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:22,210
A new player from each team will enter every 60 seconds.

1443
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,880
So the ring will fill up as time passes.

1444
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,110
- It's thrilling.
 -  This is nerve-racking.

1445
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,810
You can't find out the order ahead of time.

1446
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,180
Once the order is decided, it can't be changed.

1447
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,110
Choose wisely.

1448
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,310
This is thrilling.

1449
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,040
(The result will depend on the order and strategy.)

1450
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,480
I'm already nervous.

1451
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,240
- Oh, please.
 -  This is nerve-racking.

1452
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,610
(This is a whole new level compared to the previous rounds.)

1453
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,370
(Is it going to be Team Running Man or Team Avengers?)

1454
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,110
- I'm a little nervous.
 -  Let's go.

1455
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,420
- Go, team!
 -  I'll give it a try.

1456
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,810
I will explain the rules.

1457
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,560
Both teams are deciding the order now, and it is very crucial.

1458
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,540
As you know how Royal Rumble works,

1459
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,040
the game depends on the order of the players' entrance.

1460
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,940
If you get unlucky, you can get your tag ripped right away.

1461
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,140
Or the player can be of big help to the other players of the team.

1462
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,380
Shouldn't the first one be someone who will get the tag ripped first?

1463
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,980
- No. No.
 -  Jong Kook shouldn't go first.

1464
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,280
- No, I should go first.
 -  Okay.

1465
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
- Jong Kook.
 -  Even if Dong Hyun comes out,

1466
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,360
- Jong Kook can fight him.
 -  Then Jong Kook has to go first.

1467
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,180
Joon Hyun is really strong, too.

1468
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,940
- He's unbelievable.
 -  I know.

1469
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,810
- He's strong and he's heavy.
 -  And...

1470
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,040
- He's big.
 -  I don't know if I can grab him.

1471
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,480
- He's big, so it's not easy.
 -  I know.

1472
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,680
By the way, they consider Jung Jin as the ace.

1473
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,340
- He's got a great physique.
 -  Right.

1474
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,610
He has long arms.

1475
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,160
Dong Hyun fights against two people at once.

1476
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,910
Even if he's on the floor, we can't lift him.

1477
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,980
I really don't want to lose in the Name Tag Elimination.

1478
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,040
Yes, it's our game.

1479
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,580
- You need know-how.
 -  Right?

1480
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,020
We are the professionals for this game.

1481
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,110
- We have to decide the order.
 -  I think...

1482
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:58,140
if we rip the first person from start, we have an advantage.

1483
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,660
- That's right.
 -  A strong player should go first.

1484
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,240
They dread Dong Hyun the most. They're wondering when his turn is.

1485
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,930
Jong Kook must be thinking about when to come out.

1486
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,140
Nobody can lift him.

1487
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,330
(It's clear who's strong and who's weak.)

1488
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,780
- All right.
 -  We have to win this.

1489
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,170
- We have to win this.
 -  All right!

1490
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,480
- One, two, three. Let's go!
 -  Let's go!

1491
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,880
- Let's go!
 -  Oh, goodness.

1492
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,010
We should shout, too.

1493
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,240
(Shouting)

1494
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,170
(We can't lose.)

1495
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,640
(They will lose their voices before ripping name tags.)

1496
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,210
"Running Rumble" will begin soon.

1497
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,580
This is the last round that will determine the final result.

1498
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,820
It follows the rules of Royal Rumble.

1499
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,080
They wouldn't know this.

1500
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,640
(They have their own ways of fixing their name tags.)

1501
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,090
They wouldn't know this.

1502
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,000
- They don't know this know-how.
 -  Only we know this.

1503
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,500
Press the name tags down.

1504
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,840
(They know.)

1505
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,270
- Look at me.
 -  Go, Joon Hyun!

1506
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,840
Look at me.

1507
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,140
(They do the medical check, too.)

1508
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:01,780
I will introduce the first players of the two teams.

1509
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,140
Team Running Man versus Team Avengers.

1510
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,240
(Who will be the first?)

1511
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,240
Five, four, three, two, one.

1512
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,810
(The first round will determine the result. How lucky will they be?)

1513
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,360
They can't beat us in this game.

1514
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,140
- Go, team.
 -  Go, team.

1515
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,780
Kim Jong Kook from Team Running Man!

1516
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,910
(Jong Kook is the first player from Team Running Man.)

1517
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,010
It's Jong Kook.

1518
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,380
(The Avengers look confident.)

1519
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,910
Kim Jong Kook from Team Running Man!

1520
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,580
And from Team Avengers...

1521
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,740
(Who will be the first player from Team Avengers?)

1522
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,240
Three, two, one.

1523
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,310
Kim Joon Hyun!

1524
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,810
(It's Joon Hyun.)

1525
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,340
- Kim Joon Hyun!
 -  Let's go!

1526
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,410
(It's Joon Hyun.)

1527
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,680
It's Joon Hyun.

1528
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,540
There's a strong chance.

1529
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,340
- Next is Dong Hyun.
 -  It's good this way.

1530
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,790
He was standing at the gate.

1531
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:09,540
Well... Size-wise, it's going to be an interesting match.

1532
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,940
- Right.
 -  Joon Hyun entered first.

1533
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,610
Joon Hyun.

1534
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,980
(If I rip his name tag, we have a chance.)

1535
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,510
(He falls.)

1536
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,290
Gosh.

1537
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:23,010
- Hello.
 -  Why are you the first one?

1538
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:26,440
It's the Name Tag Elimination. The first round is important.

1539
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,970
And if neither of them succeed, another player will enter.

1540
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,010
It might become a completely different game.

1541
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,580
There you go.

1542
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,710
(Go, Asian black bear.)

1543
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,610
- Let's go!
 -  It's starting.

1544
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,580
Joon Hyun.

1545
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,280
(They undermine each other.)

1546
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,010
Why are you the first player?

1547
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,140
- Do we begin now?
 -  Do we begin right away?

1548
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,080
(The first match starts.)

1549
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,340
They are starting.

1550
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,240
Did it begin?

1551
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,240
- Do we begin now?
 -  Do we begin right away?

1552
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,440
What's this?

1553
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,650
(Jong Kook spots an opportunity!)

1554
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,680
(I got you, Joon Hyun!)

1555
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,680
Why are you so aggressive?

1556
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,240
(Joon Hyun perfectly blocks Jong Kook.)

1557
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,740
- That's terrifying.
 -  What's happening?

1558
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,940
(It's very interesting.)

1559
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,680
Jong Kook lacks endurance.

1560
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,340
Why are you so aggressive?

1561
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,140
(Jong Kook wants to end it in 60 seconds.)

1562
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,080
(Joon Hyun counter-attacks.)

1563
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,180
(The name tag is right there.)

1564
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,380
(The Asian black bear's counter-attack is threatening.)

1565
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,580
(Amazed)

1566
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,340
That's not easy.

1567
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,580
(It's nip and tuck.)

1568
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,570
(Jong Kook tries to end it fast, but Joon Hyun's holding on.)

1569
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,940
(Tiger vs bear)

1570
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,340
Go, Joon Hyun!

1571
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,410
(That bear is not an easy opponent.)

1572
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:55,340
(Don't underestimate the bear!)

1573
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,710
(Joon Hyun steps on Jong Kook's foot...)

1574
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,380
(and falls.)

1575
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,880
- Oh, no!
 -  Oh, gosh!

1576
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,000
- No! Rip the tag!
 -  Hurry up!

1577
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,310
Hurry up!

1578
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,740
(He was doing well until he stepped on his foot.)

1579
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,790
(He makes strange noises.)

1580
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,980
The mic lines are out. Jong Kook took down Joon Hyun.

1581
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,610
(They're extremely focused.)

1582
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,110
He ripped the name tag. It's over.

1583
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,080
(The bear gathers all the energy he got from his bear food.)

1584
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,880
(Jong Kook grabs his name tag!)

1585
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,180
(The tiger has taken the bear by his claws!)

1586
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,810
No! No!

1587
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,570
He ripped the name tag. It's over.

1588
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:44,780
(If he holds on for 15 seconds, help will be on his way.)

1589
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,310
(Jong Kook rips the name tag.)

1590
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,480
I did it!

1591
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,840
(Joon Hyun is out!)

1592
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,180
- Okay.
 -  He did it!

1593
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,270
- He ripped it.
 -  He did it.

1594
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,710
It's done.

1595
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,040
Goodness, he's really good.

1596
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,710
Although Joon Hyun is heavier,

1597
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,510
- Jong Kook is stronger.
 -  That's right.

1598
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:11,580
I'm so humiliated.

1599
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,710
(He's a mess.)

1600
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,580
(The sly Kwang Soo will play next.)

1601
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,850
- We're in a better position.
 -  We've got the advantage.

1602
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,510
- Jong Kook is really good.
 -  We can't swap now.

1603
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,840
- What should we do?
 -  I think we made a mistake.

1604
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,880
Five, four, three, two, one.

1605
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,710
(The 60-second countdown begins.)

1606
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,410
What are you doing?

1607
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,480
(Lee Kwang Soo is up next.)

1608
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,510
(What is it? Why does Jong Kook look so worried?)

1609
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,810
- Who is it?
 -  Is it Dong Hyun?

1610
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,240
- It's Dong Hyun, isn't it?
 -  It must be him.

1611
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,310
What are you doing?

1612
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:55,340
(Is the ultimate weapon, Dong Hyun, here?)

1613
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,010
(It's Lee Gyeong Gyu.)

1614
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,100
Come in. Hurry.

1615
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,230
(It's Lee Gyeong Gyu.)

1616
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,340
There's no other way around.

1617
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,380
- It's Gyeong Gyu.
 -  Did Gyeong Gyu come out?

1618
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,980
That's right.

1619
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,210
Kwang Soo came out as the second player.

1620
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,840
- I think we made a bad decision.
 -  Yes, we did.

1621
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,240
Come in. Hurry.

1622
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,980
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

1623
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,740
Gyeong Gyu has to play against them alone.

1624
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:28,180
It's hasn't started yet, but his will to fight looks lost.

1625
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,080
Gyeong Gyu can only hope for their respect and mercy.

1626
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,180
You're right. I think he can't even stand against them for 10 seconds.

1627
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,280
I feel bad for him.

1628
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Shall we begin?

1629
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,440
(The merciless second round begins.)

1630
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,810
- Am I fighting against you two?
 -  Yes.

1631
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,180
(Easy, boys. I'm old.)

1632
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,140
Kwang Soo, we have to do this.

1633
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,640
(Believe in your age and experience, Gyeong Gyu!)

1634
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:52,160
(Although he's old, he's skilled at martial arts.)

1635
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,240
(Will he be able to show everyone his skills?)

1636
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,310
(He runs away...)

1637
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,410
(and lies down flat.)

1638
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,180
(He lies down immediately.)

1639
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,210
We're sorry.

1640
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,010
(He kicks Kwang Soo in the face.)

1641
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,740
(It may not be martial arts, but it's a successful kick.)

1642
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,840
(As a true master of laughter, he makes everyone laugh.)

1643
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:20,210
(He's as jumpy and fierce as a caught fish.)

1644
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,640
He actually kicked Kwang Soo.

1645
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,380
He's doing better than we thought. It's a surprise.

1646
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,680
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook underestimated him.

1647
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,740
(Gyeong Gyu resists desperately.)

1648
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,310
(He smacks Kwang Soo again.)

1649
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,940
In martial arts, we call that "ground skills".

1650
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,410
You put your opponent on the ground and...

1651
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,830
(Gyeong Gyu tries everything from kicking to grabbing hair.)

1652
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:42,010
Gyeong Gyu is fighting really well.

1653
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,280
(Hold on just a bit longer, Gyeong Gyu.)

1654
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,610
(What an intense battle! Who will be next?)

1655
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,640
Five, four, three,

1656
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,610
- two,
 -  Rip his name tag!

1657
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,640
- one.
 -  You have to!

1658
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,810
(All the players on stage are exhausted.)

1659
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:09,740
(They need help from the new players.)

1660
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,740
Hurry, hurry!

1661
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,940
- Is it Dong Hyun?
 -  All right. The third player...

1662
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,540
from Team Running Man is Yu Jae Seok.

1663
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,930
And it's Cho Sae Ho from Team Avengers.

1664
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,410
(Jae Seok and Sae Ho join.)

1665
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,480
(Stumbling)

1666
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,310
(As soon as he enters, Sae Ho runs for his life.)

1667
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,310
It's Sae Ho.

1668
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,380
(I'll join you soon.)

1669
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:31,310
(The giraffe suddenly goes mad and charges towards him.)

1670
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:34,110
(Will Kwang Soo successfully rip Sae Ho's name tag?)

1671
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,980
(You're our only hope, Sae Ho.)

1672
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,780
- What should we do with him?
 -  Why is he so fast?

1673
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,780
(He desperately lies down.)

1674
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,410
(He uses the wriggling worm tactic.)

1675
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,940
Why is he so fast?

1676
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,910
(Wriggling)

1677
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,910
(It's an incredible speed.)

1678
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,680
Why is he so fast?

1679
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,440
(They explode in laughter.)

1680
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,210
He's crawling on his back.

1681
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:06,080
He's focusing on securing his name tag.

1682
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,880
(I got you.)

1683
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,010
Hurry. You must rip his name tag.

1684
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,510
Hold on. Hold on just a bit longer.

1685
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,110
(He's doing his best to secure his name tag.)

1686
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,710
- What are you guys doing?
 -  Hey, hey.

1687
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,180
- Gyeong Gyu is still holding on.
 -  That's amazing.

1688
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,540
He's holding on like a veteran.

1689
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,310
(Team Avengers is short on numbers. They need help.)

1690
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,330
- I think Dong Hyun is next.
 -  Hold on, hold on.

1691
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:30,140
(Bingo)

1692
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,540
(I will send you all off in a blink of an eye.)

1693
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,610
- Hold on.
 -  What are you doing?

1694
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,510
(Both Gyeong Gyu and Sae Ho are about to be eliminated.)

1695
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,040
Five, four, three...

1696
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,040
(We can't hold on any longer.)

1697
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,180
(We need you, Dong Hyun.)

1698
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,180
(I'm coming.)

1699
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,580
(Please hurry!)

1700
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,940
(Gary sets off to the stage from Team Running Man.)

1701
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,740
(Here comes the powerful fighting machine.)

1702
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
No.

1703
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,780
(Ripping)

1704
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,580
(He couldn't hold on any more. Sae Ho is out.)

1705
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,740
(Gary and Dong Hyun are next.)

1706
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,740
(He flips into the stage.)

1707
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,610
(Gary and Dong Hyun are next.)

1708
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,340
(Sae Ho is out. Now, Gyeong Gyu must be protected.)

1709
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,080
(Although they are short on numbers, Dong Hyun is here now.)

1710
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,580
- Is he Dong Hyun?
 -  Look. It's Dong Hyun.

1711
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,010
We can win this.

1712
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,210
Team Running Man is tense.

1713
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,710
The four of them suddenly gathered together.

1714
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,090
(Running Man members group up as Dong Hyun enters.)

1715
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,370
- Are you okay?
 -  Yes.

1716
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,790
Come behind me.

1717
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,010
(Finally, I am saved.)

1718
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,540
Did you rip it?

1719
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,380
Dong Hyun seems like he can beat all of them on his own.

1720
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,110
- Gyeong Gyu is hiding behind him.
 -  They can't approach him easily.

1721
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,380
(Focus on Gyeong Gyu.)

1722
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,310
(He is our target.)

1723
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,610
They are approaching Gyeong Gyu.

1724
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,240
He fell down.

1725
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,550
What is this? I can't move my legs.

1726
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,180
(Dong Hyun wraps his legs around Jong Kook's legs.)

1727
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,050
Jong Kook's legs are wrapped.

1728
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,510
That's amazing.

1729
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:17,010
(Team Running Man successfully pushes Gyeong Gyu to the ground.)

1730
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,380
Gary pushed Gyeong Gyu down.

1731
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,080
(Gyeong Gyu is in danger.)

1732
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,010
(No, Gyeong Gyu. I can't let you go like this.)

1733
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,410
(Can Gyeong Gyu overcome this critical moment?)

1734
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,800
Four, three...

1735
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,980
(Gyeong Gyu is out.)

1736
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,440
(It's 4 versus 1 now.)

1737
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,140
(Who are the fifth players?)

1738
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,840
It's time. The fifth players are coming out.

1739
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,910
It's Haha from Team Running Man...

1740
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,910
and Lee Su Min from Team Avengers.

1741
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,810
(Gyeong Gyu has been heroically taken out.)

1742
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,340
Hurry. hurry. It's Su Min.

1743
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,380
- Wait?
 -  Why are you here?

1744
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,610
(Haha tries to rip Su Min's name tag.)

1745
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,510
(Meanwhile, the other four members focus on Dong Hyun.)

1746
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,940
(Swarming)

1747
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,680
They look just like hyenas...

1748
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,310
- gathered up for hunting.
 -  It's like a lion...

1749
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,980
- is fighting against hyenas.
 -  Right.

1750
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,400
No, don't come near.

1751
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,000
- I got her.
 -  Get away.

1752
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,090
(Hold on just a bit longer, Dong Hyun.)

1753
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,710
(I'm coming for you.)

1754
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:24,280
- I'm sorry, Su Min.
 -  Rip her name tag!

1755
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,980
(Team Avengers is overwhelmed in number. They're in great danger.)

1756
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,210
(Will the next player turn this situation around?)

1757
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,640
(Please help us!)

1758
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:44,980
(He falls down.)

1759
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,110
(He falls down on the stage.)

1760
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,580
(Ripping)

1761
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,480
(It took only a second. Jae Hwan is out.)

1762
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,910
(That was the fastest elimination in Running Man's history.)

1763
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,710
Are you okay? Are you all right, Jae Hwan?

1764
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,780
Jae Hwan tripped on the rope...

1765
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,410
and lost his name tag right away.

1766
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:08,640
- Which team is he playing on?
 -  That was really ludicrous.

1767
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,210
(Play of the day: In a blink of an eye)

1768
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,480
Come out of there!

1769
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,880
(Laughing)

1770
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,740
(She can't stop laughing after watching that ludicrous play.)

1771
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,280
(What should I do now?)

1772
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,940
Team Avengers is still holding on. They are relying...

1773
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,770
on the personal strength of Dong Hyun...

1774
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,640
and Su Min's persistence.

1775
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,780
(But now!)

1776
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:35,410
(Dong Hyun successfully grabs Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1777
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,310
(Ripping)

1778
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,940
Kwang Soo. You're out.

1779
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,640
- I'm out, I'm out!
 -  All right, Kwang Soo.

1780
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,310
- You're out, Kwang Soo! You're out!
 -  You're out.

1781
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,700
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1782
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,780
Hold on.

1783
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,010
(He's holding on with monstrous strength.)

1784
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,080
(It's 5 versus 2 now.)

1785
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,740
How can you harass a little girl like her?

1786
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:57,340
(As long as Dong Hyun's alive, Team Avengers has hope.)

1787
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,980
(I've been ripping name tags for 6 years. I must win this match.)

1788
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:04,510
(Gary's hand sneaks behind Dong Hyun's back.)

1789
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,340
(He successfully grabs Dong Hyun's name tag!)

1790
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,170
There are 60 seconds left!

1791
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,310
(Be careful, Dong Hyun!)

1792
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:16,050
(Can Dong Hyun defend this? Or will Team Running Man be victorious?)

1793
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,110
I got it! I ripped his name tag!

1794
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:22,240
(Dong Hyun is out.)

1795
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,840
(Gosh!)

1796
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,380
Dong Hyun's name tag has finally been ripped off.

1797
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,610
(Team Avengers has lost their best player.)

1798
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,590
(Team Running Man is definitely on a higher ground now.)

1799
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,830
- What should I do?
 -  Hold on.

1800
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,380
(The end is near. Who are the last players?)

1801
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,810
(He looks determined.)

1802
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:42,280
(Just hold on. I'm on my way.)

1803
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,880
(Finally, the last members from each team enter the stage.)

1804
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,440
(Running Man's strong woman, Ji Hyo, is next.)

1805
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,980
(The last hope of Team Avengers. Jung Jin is on his way now.)

1806
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,600
Here comes the last members. It's Ji Hyo from Team Running Man...

1807
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,110
and Jung Jin from Team Avengers.

1808
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:01,580
Jung Jin is very well-built.

1809
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,110
Ji Hyo is too small compared to him.

1810
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,050
- Our plan is wrong.
 -  There's Jung Jin.

1811
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,040
- Be careful of Jung Jin.
 -  Defend well.

1812
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,340
(5 players vs 2 players)

1813
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,780
Watch out. There's Jung Jin.

1814
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,810
(We have no more players to join. This is the final round.)

1815
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:20,010
(Will Jung Jin be able to put an end to the match?)

1816
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,110
They have Jung Jin.

1817
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,010
(Jung Jin spots the absent-minded Seok Jin.)

1818
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,740
(He makes a dash.)

1819
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,610
Jung Jin isn't out yet!

1820
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:32,210
(Jung Jin catches Seok Jin off guard.)

1821
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,420
What?

1822
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,480
(He claps like a seal.)

1823
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,380
- What was that?
 -  Jung Jin isn't out.

1824
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,010
He ripped Seok Jin's name tag.

1825
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:40,840
- He removed the name tag.
 -  Wow, Jung Jin is very fast.

1826
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,080
- Jung Jin...
 -  It's not bad. We can do it.

1827
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,850
Although there are three left, you can do it.

1828
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,660
I think you can beat them.

1829
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,910
Wow, Su Min is good at this.

1830
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,620
Jung Jin, don't let them get you.

1831
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,110
The competition is getting fiercer.

1832
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:55,880
It's 4 to 2 now.

1833
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,440
But if they beat one player in Team Running Man, it'll become 3 to 2.

1834
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,480
Then, they can win.

1835
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,510
I'll take care of this side.

1836
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,380
Wait. Hold on.

1837
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,380
- Wait.
 -  Jong Gook...

1838
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,480
(Jong Gook grabs Jung Jin.)

1839
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,210
Jong Gook just grabbed Jung Jin.

1840
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,440
He's running toward Jung Jin.

1841
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,060
(No way!)

1842
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,240
No.

1843
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,510
(Jung Jin is our last hope.)

1844
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:17,740
(Will he be able to survive here?)

1845
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:18,970
(Jae Seok removes Jung Jin's name tag.)

1846
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,090
No.

1847
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,710
(3 members cooperate and beat Jung Jin.)

1848
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,910
My goodness.

1849
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,240
Oh, dear.

1850
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,280
(Jung Jin is out!)

1851
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,410
Jung Jin, you're embarrassed, right?

1852
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,550
Go, Su Min.

1853
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,480
Your plan failed.

1854
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,880
(Jae Seok removes Su Min's name tag.)

1855
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,050
Su Min is out!

1856
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,210
(Team Running Man wins the "Running Rumble" round.)

1857
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,050
(He's furious and resentful.)

1858
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,110
The final winner is...

1859
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,100
Team Running Man.

1860
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,700
(Team Running Man is the final winner.)

1861
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,080
Well, I think...

1862
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,520
- Our plan was great.
 -  I am sorry.

1863
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,560
This is an award for the winners.

1864
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,600
(Team Running Man receives gold badges.)

1865
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,600
Today, the king of variety shows,

1866
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:06,430
Gyeong Gyu...

1867
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,590
- made us laugh a lot. Thank you.
 -  You're welcome.

1868
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:09,790
Thank you very much.

1869
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,730
Next week,

1870
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,730
I will come back with new members.

1871
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,460
I'll create a new team.

1872
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,330
- They weren't that good today.
 -  Really?

1873
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,790
How was it today?

1874
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,060
It was fun.

1875
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,300
Thank you for joining us!

1876
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,030
(Variety Avengers won't stop here. There will be a rematch.)

1877
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,930
(Next Week)

1878
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,100
No! Wait!

1879
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,360
(We haven't shot the episode yet.)

1880
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,230
(We'll just show you how it will look like.)

1881
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,430
(You already know what it will be like, right?)

1882
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:40,670
(Suspicious R Rescue)
