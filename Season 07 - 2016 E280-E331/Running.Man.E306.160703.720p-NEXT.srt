1
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:13,813
(At a quiet beach on a foggy day)

2
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:17,483
(What will happen here today?)

3
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,343
I don't think there will be anyone to rescue today.

4
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:22,843
(Suspicious lifeguards are protecting this foggy beach.)

5
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:24,943
Look how foggy the sky is.

6
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,643
- Wow. - Yes, it's quite foggy.

7
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:29,813
Are we females or males?

8
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:32,643
(Mysterious gender identity)

9
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,783
(There's a blond lady with a moustache.)

10
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,713
- That's scary. - Oh, my.

11
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,113
(They need to change their hair styles first.)

12
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,243
Hello.

13
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:43,683
She looks very young today.

14
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:44,983
- You're right. - What do you eat?

15
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:46,783
You lost so much weight.

16
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:49,043
That's not true. I haven't.

17
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,643
(There they come!)

18
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:54,783
Oh, Jong Kook!

19
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:57,983
(Sexy masculine guys are riding through the foggy beach.)

20
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,783
- Hello. - Why are they...

21
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,213
- Hello. - Hi!

22
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,343
What's wrong with your shoulders?

23
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:04,913
(Team leader Jae Seok, an exotic-looking guy)

24
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,783
(Team leader Jong Kook, a muscular gangster)

25
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,143
Wow, you are here.

26
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,213
You guys look scary.

27
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:11,413
(Two charismatic team leaders show up.)

28
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,583
- My goodness. - You look scary.

29
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,013
- Hello. - They look scary.

30
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,083
Why are your shoulders so tense?

31
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,643
(Jong Kook versus Jae Seok)

32
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,743
Hi.

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,613
(Jong Kook powerfully takes his jacket off.)

34
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,713
Gosh, you scared me.

35
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,113
(Jae Seok feels unpleasant.)

36
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,883
He is really scary.

37
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:28,183
He looks like a character from a comic book.

38
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:30,343
I thought we're shooting an American animation film.

39
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:31,843
He looks just like that prince.

40
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:32,943
(They look perfectly the same.)

41
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,513
Good morning, everyone.

42
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:38,083
My goodness. Gosh.

43
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,013
- Anyway, - How are you guys?

44
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:44,743
- my team members surprised me. - Why?

45
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,783
Are you holding a concert today?

46
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:49,783
- We're the rescue team. - Are you sure?

47
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:50,883
What's your name?

48
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,943
- Sorry? - Don't you have an English name?

49
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:54,083
- Me? - Yes.

50
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,313
- I do have one. - What is it?

51
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:56,883
- It's Bruce. - Bruce?

52
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,813
It's Bruce.

53
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,043
- Bruce? - Yes.

54
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,143
- Are you Bruce Yu? - Yes.

55
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,013
- Oh, you're Bruce Yu. - What's your name?

56
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,143
I'm Cray.

57
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:06,013
- He's Crab. - Crab?

58
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:07,813
Oh, no.

59
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,743
- You like crabs. - He does.

60
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:11,683
- I'll catch you a crab later. - It's Cray.

61
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,083
So, he's Crab. What's yours?

62
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,213
- I'm Sophie. - You're Long.

63
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,543
(Jae Seok names Kwang Soo Long only because he's tall.)

64
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,953
- That is hilarious. - He's Long.

65
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,713
- Is he a guy or a girl? - His name is Long.

66
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,343
- He doesn't know that either. - That's not important.

67
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,013
- What's your name? - Me?

68
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,613
- I'm Mark. - Isn't it Bench?

69
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,383
What are you talking about?

70
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,953
- Bench? - He is Benchmarking.

71
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:33,243
(This American gangster is good at benchmarking.)

72
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:34,513
His name is Bench Mark.

73
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,543
What's your name?

74
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,983
I'm Red Song.

75
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,283
- Red Song? Isn't it Red Sun? - It's Red Song.

76
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,683
- I will hypnotise you. - In 1, 2, 3.

77
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,183
- Red Sun. - She's sleeping all the time.

78
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:45,543
- What's yours? - I'm Shark.

79
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,183
You're Jellyfish.

80
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:49,343
- You're Chakra. - No, I am not.

81
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:51,083
(Haha looks like Chakra members.)

82
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,243
Go, go, you look old

83
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:54,043
Go, go, you look old

84
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,213
- Chakra. Good one. - Hello, Chun Bong.

85
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,083
No, I'm Gary Parker.

86
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,013
Gary Parker?

87
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,083
He's Pierrot.

88
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:03,013
- No. - Pierrot?

89
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,743
- His name is Chun Bong. - No, he's Pierrot.

90
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,243
Wait. We have four members...

91
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,643
- and they have three. - Right.

92
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,783
- I think it's because... - It means they have a guest member.

93
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,013
- That's right. - They'll have a guest member.

94
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,843
We'll have 2 guest members and you'll have 1 guest.

95
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,443
- What? - We have 2 guests and you have 1.

96
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,883
- Everyone knows that, you brat. - How can you say that to me?

97
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,213
- Did you say, "brat"? - You can't say that to him.

98
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:22,913
You know how close we are.

99
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,743
In the States, everyone is friends despite the age differences.

100
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,413
- This is not the States. - Do you want to die today?

101
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,043
Hey. My goodness.

102
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,343
- What are you doing? - Hey, come here.

103
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,643
- Gosh. - We are rivals.

104
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,143
What? Rivals?

105
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,813
- He's blocking him with his hands. - Step back.

106
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,413
- He's distancing himself. - He's scary.

107
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,243
- Wait. - Who is it?

108
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:45,583
(There is someone else on the beach other than them.)

109
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:52,713
(A tall trio shows up at Hanagae Beach.)

110
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:00,443
- Who is it? - He's Nichkhun.

111
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:02,943
- He's Nichkhun. - Oh no, he's on the Red Team?

112
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,113
- Lee Ki Woo is here, too. - She's Gyeong Ree.

113
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,983
- Oh, he's Lee Ki Woo. - Hello, Gyeong Ree.

114
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,443
- Welcome to Running Man. - Hello.

115
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:10,643
- Hello. - Gyeong Ree is here.

116
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,113
- Gyeong Ree, Nichkhun... - Hello.

117
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:14,883
- Hello, Nichkhun. - It's good to see you.

118
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,253
(Nichkhun, Gyeong Ree and Lee Ki Woo)

119
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,383
Wow, Gyeong Ree.

120
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,043
Hello, how are you?

121
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,413
- We're in the same team. - Right.

122
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:23,883
It's so nice to see you.

123
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,943
Kwang Soo, you are not so tall compared to Ki Woo.

124
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,213
- That's right. - He's really tall.

125
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,313
- He's so tall. - Kwang Soo, you're not that tall.

126
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,883
And Ki Woo is tall and handsome.

127
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:34,683
Although Ki Woo is handsome and tall,

128
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,183
- he's a bit sloppy. - Really?

129
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:39,483
No, he's not.

130
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,083
Ki Woo, please introduce yourself.

131
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,343
This is my first time to be on Running Man.

132
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:44,443
I'm an actor, Lee Ki Woo.

133
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,583
He's Chung Ah's man.

134
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,413
- He's adorable. - He's so cute.

135
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,783
He's Chung Ah's man.

136
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:51,943
- Is she his girlfriend? - He's Chung Ah's man.

137
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,013
Oh, really?

138
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,253
My goodness.

139
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,843
How can you not know that?

140
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:57,443
- I didn't know. - You're embarrassing him.

141
00:04:57,443 --> 00:05:00,583
- I was just curious. - Dear me. Seriously.

142
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,753
(She's my girlfriend, Seok Jin.)

143
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,383
Nichkhun is here with us as well.

144
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,443
Hello, I'm almost a Running Man member. I'm Nichkhun.

145
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,113
(Nichkhun appeared on Running Man 11 times.)

146
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:11,783
It's been a long time.

147
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,643
- It's been so long. - He looks like an American guy.

148
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,313
Your hairstyle looks good.

149
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:18,583
- He really looks like an American. - Goodness.

150
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,043
We have Gyeong Ree in our team!

151
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:22,813
(Summer beauty, Gyeong Ree)

152
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:24,013
You're so beautiful.

153
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,783
Gyeong Ree from Nine Musics...

154
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,843
- is here with us. - It's Muses.

155
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,413
Right. Nine Muses.

156
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,883
I am sorry, but I'm sure...

157
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:35,243
you all saw how Seok Jin just corrected me with her group name.

158
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,813
But when Gyeong Ree was coming out, he said, "Who is she?"

159
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,243
- You're too mean. - You're unbelievable.

160
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:42,683
- Gosh. - She was just too far away.

161
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:45,683
- How can you not recognise her? - He's unbelievable.

162
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:48,083
- Really. - Everyone knows Gyeong Ree.

163
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,343
- Please come to the back. - His eyes are bad.

164
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:51,783
- They are. - Yes.

165
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,013
Why did you put on the sunglasses all of a sudden?

166
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,313
I wanted to look at Ki Woo.

167
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,683
He's cute.

168
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:01,143
- She's good. - She's acting like an old woman.

169
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:03,583
- Gosh... - What has gotten into you?

170
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,313
- Why did you change so much? - She adores him.

171
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,713
- I wanted to see Ki Woo. - She adores him.

172
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:09,883
You must be looking to buy some lands here.

173
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:12,913
- The red hair suits her well. - It does suit her well.

174
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,083
- New members have joined us. - Right.

175
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:17,983
Should we give them English names?

176
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,713
- You can call me Nick. - Nick.

177
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,583
- Nick is good. - Nicky.

178
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,083
How about you, Ki Woo?

179
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,883
- Panick? - "Panick" is a little...

180
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,543
- Just be Thomas. - Thomas?

181
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,183
Thomas the train is long.

182
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,513
- Great. - The Thomas train is long.

183
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,113
- You can be Thomas. - Thomas.

184
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,443
- How about you, Gyeong Ree? - I want to be Sandy.

185
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,143
- Sandy. Why? - Yes.

186
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,013
- There's sand here. - That's perfect.

187
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,743
The name Sandy and the sand go well together.

188
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,513
Sandy. It sounds tough.

189
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:45,143
Sandy, you are tougher than I thought.

190
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,183
The name has an impact.

191
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,583
- She's Sandy. - Isn't it nice?

192
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,683
- Sandy is tougher than I thought. - Is she?

193
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,913
Sandy is nice. We will call her Sandy from now on.

194
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,613
(The three new members are ready!)

195
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:02,313
Today, there will be a joint training, and one of...

196
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,783
the two team leaders will be promoted as the captain.

197
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,443
How about Chun Bong?

198
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:10,113
- You can be Sunset then. - Seok Jin is like a doctor.

199
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,413
We're rivals.

200
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,643
(They'll do unexpected missions. What will happen to them?)

201
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:20,913
(Suspicious R Rescue)

202
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,513
(The siren goes off.)

203
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,383
- It's an emergency. - What's going on?

204
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,343
(Why is the siren going off?)

205
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:33,183
- It's an emergency. - What's going on?

206
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:34,413
They're bringing out a television.

207
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,943
- What's going on? - There's a television.

208
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:39,383
(They bring out a television on the middle of the beach!)

209
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:41,083
- Will they really play something? - What is that?

210
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,743
- Will a person come out of it? - What is that?

211
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,783
Maybe someone will open the screen and come out.

212
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,343
What was his name?

213
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:51,343
(Who is he?)

214
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:53,243
Maybe someone will open the screen and come out.

215
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,043
- Hello, everyone. - David Hasselhoff.

216
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,243
David Hasselhoff.

217
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,543
(He's the captain of "Baywatch", a popular TV series from the 90s.)

218
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,083
Hello, everyone.

219
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,883
(Why is David Hasselhoff here?)

220
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:08,443
Good job ensuring maritime safety in the honour of...

221
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:11,343
- Suspicious R Rescue. - I know him.

222
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:15,143
I've heard about Team Leader Kim Jong Kook's recent...

223
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:17,113
take-down of Jaws which appeared on the beach.

224
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,313
I've also heard about how Team Leader Yu Jae Seok...

225
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:21,983
caught the pervert on the beach.

226
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,943
I'm pleased because it reminds me of my heyday.

227
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:26,943
I see.

228
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:30,783
The two team leaders' promotion to the captain depends on this mission.

229
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:34,853
(One of them will be promoted as a captain?)

230
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,113
The result of the joint training...

231
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:38,853
will determine their promotion.

232
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:42,313
The leader of the team that wins on the joint training...

233
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,483
will be promoted as the captain.

234
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,543
Yes!

235
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:48,353
And his team members will also be rewarded.

236
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,213
- Reward is nice. - The losing team...

237
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,943
will pay for their defeat.

238
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,443
You'll be gaining points on every training mission.

239
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:58,043
The points will be important...

240
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,853
for the team leader evaluation. So the team members...

241
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,353
- should try your best. - Let's go for it!

242
00:09:03,353 --> 00:09:05,853
Now, get changed into the training suits...

243
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,853
- and gather here again. - Okay. Let's go!

244
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,543
- Let's go! - Let's get trained!

245
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:13,853
The team members of the winning team...

246
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,713
will get a golden whistle as a reward.

247
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,543
I want that.

248
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:20,443
And the team member of the losing team will be flogged.

249
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:22,683
- We'll be flogged! - Stop it.

250
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:23,813
- That really hurts. - I know.

251
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,183
- The bruise lasted for a week. - Seriously.

252
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,213
Flogging is good.

253
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:29,143
Gary was flogged, but that part wasn't aired.

254
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,883
- It wasn't? - They flogged him hard...

255
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,413
and they didn't even show it on the television.

256
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,243
I'll count. In 1, 2, 3.

257
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,013
(Gary got flogged hard.)

258
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,613
(It was really fun and exciting, but we didn't have time for it.)

259
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:41,513
It hurts so much that he can't make any sound.

260
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,813
Why did you edit it out?

261
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,943
Today, one of you will become the captain.

262
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:50,283
Please do your best to win the mission.

263
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:52,383
- Please change into the suits. - Okay.

264
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,113
- And we will begin. - All right.

265
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:56,083
- Let's go! - Go!

266
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,743
- Can I talk to the team leaders? - We have to talk in English.

267
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,483
- Why are you calling us? - That's really lovely.

268
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,853
And the Red Team.

269
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,483
- Get some ice cream. - This is wrong.

270
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,353
- Why? - Why aren't we getting ice cream?

271
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,543
- What did you do wrong? - I don't know.

272
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,983
- Change into training suits. - Why aren't we getting ice cream?

273
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,513
Where's our ice cream?

274
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,283
- Why can't we eat ice cream? - I don't know.

275
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,783
- Is it because we didn't wait? - Only Red Team can eat it?

276
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,883
We must've done something wrong.

277
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,743
Why don't we get ice cream?

278
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:25,883
Why doesn't everyone get ice cream?

279
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:28,353
(We want to know the truth behind the ice cream discrimination.)

280
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,443
Isn't it strange?

281
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,913
Let's just eat first and see.

282
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,313
Perhaps we will get disadvantaged from eating this.

283
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,013
(He feels uncomfortable.)

284
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,413
Thank you.

285
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:42,243
Since you're giving them to us, we will eat them.

286
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:48,083
(They feel uncomfortable eating the ice cream.)

287
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,613
I think our team leader did something wrong.

288
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,313
(Is that what happened?)

289
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:56,483
Today,

290
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,013
every mission comes with a suspicious mission.

291
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,043
What is that?

292
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,713
There are special missions for the team leaders.

293
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,213
These missions will allow the captain to check...

294
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:09,283
if the team leaders are doing well in leading the team.

295
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,583
- Is that right? - The first mission was...

296
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,213
the team with a member who takes off the wig first loses.

297
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,443
Kwang Soo was the one.

298
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,243
(The problematic team member is Lee Kwang Soo.)

299
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,813
- That brat. - That's why the Red Team...

300
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,113
got ice cream as a reward.

301
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,213
Awesome.

302
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:31,783
(They were moving to another place several minutes ago.)

303
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:34,343
(And Kwang Soo took off the wig.)

304
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,543
(It's so cool!)

305
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,043
That's why the team leaders have to try harder.

306
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,743
Does that even make sense?

307
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,043
- This is... - Kwang Soo has to lose alone.

308
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:47,783
- Why do the team have to suffer? - Can we tell the team members?

309
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,483
We can't? All right.

310
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,843
On every game, the team leader will be evaluated.

311
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,743
- This is too much. - The moment you talk about it,

312
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:57,643
- you lose. - How can we not tell them?

313
00:11:57,643 --> 00:12:00,913
- You can't tell them. - We have to blame him though!

314
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,013
- You... - I'm craving ice cream!

315
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,783
Just go to him and slap him for no reason.

316
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,643
(It's nice to feel the air.)

317
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,083
- So do not... - Let's go.

318
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,143
- talk about it. - All right.

319
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,713
Let's go! Don't you dare talk about it.

320
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:17,513
(The training starts with much secret and frustration.)

321
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,383
(The real competition begins.)

322
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,883
- Let's go! - Start!

323
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,883
- This is... - Why do we look so weak?

324
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,313
- This is unfair. - Why are we a team?

325
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:26,513
- Why did we become a team? - It's good enough.

326
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,283
- We have Gyeong Ree. - I can do well.

327
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,413
- I know. - We can do well.

328
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:32,713
At least the vibe is good.

329
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:37,343
- What is that? - What's that?

330
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,313
Is it another obstacle game?

331
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:43,813
- Hey. - It's an obstacle game.

332
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,613
(The obstacle road is stretched along the beach!)

333
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:48,813
- This is crazy. - What's this?

334
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,383
Gary, this is...

335
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:53,043
- What's up with the angle? - This is too much.

336
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,543
It's too much.

337
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:57,283
- The captain planned it. - It's going to be fun.

338
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:59,613
- The captain did? - He should've come himself.

339
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,613
Everyone, there are...

340
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,143
hidden missions everywhere.

341
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:06,113
- What did you say? - What?

342
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,713
We all...

343
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,913
- We... - We lived abroad for many years.

344
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,913
- Is that right? - That's why he can't pronounce.

345
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:13,183
- Is that right? - No, it's not that.

346
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,413
It's been a long time since Ki Woo's been on a variety show.

347
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,943
- He is so tall. - In the past,

348
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,083
- he was in a lot of variety shows. - Many years ago.

349
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,713
- He was on "X-Man"? - Yes.

350
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:24,943
(He appealed his charms with his stiff and long body.)

351
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:28,513
(He captured girls' hearts with his cute behaviour.)

352
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,583
He used to act like Kwang Soo.

353
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,813
- Right. - Is he sloppy like Kwang Soo?

354
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,743
The tall ones tend to be sloppy.

355
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,983
- But he's balanced unlike this guy. - That's right.

356
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,743
- No, we are similar. - They are very different.

357
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:39,983
- You have to be this big. - His head is so small.

358
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,913
His head is so small, and his shoulders are broad.

359
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,843
If you're not going to be like him, it's better to be short like me.

360
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:47,443
- What's wrong with me? - It's better to be me.

361
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,843
- It's better to be him. - I hate him.

362
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,783
He's fine.

363
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,383
- What's going on? - What's going on?

364
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,113
- The television is here again. - There it comes.

365
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:57,343
It's Mr Hasselhoff.

366
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:01,443
- Mr Hasselhoff. - Are you all ready?

367
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:03,113
- Yes. - Next competition is...

368
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:06,143
"Beach Relay", which will test your teamwork.

369
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,243
- It's going to be a relay. - The team members will stand...

370
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,743
in front of the four obstacles on the beach.

371
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:14,113
You will pass the rescue tube baton...

372
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:18,613
and the team that finishes first will win.

373
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,783
- You will play three rounds, - So this is it.

374
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:22,843
and the team that wins twice will win.

375
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:26,643
Plan a strategy and place the right person for each course.

376
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,343
- We will play three rounds. - All right.

377
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,243
Let's check your abilities.

378
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:32,283
- So we have to pass the tube. - Yes.

379
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,043
The first course is running.

380
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:37,243
- Please place one member there. - Gary can do that.

381
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,543
The second course is deflating the giant tube.

382
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,843
You have to deflate it and put it in a box.

383
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:44,043
- Kwang Soo can do that. - Kwang Soo can do that.

384
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:47,413
- We'll place two people there. - Two people.

385
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:50,043
- We have to deflate it. - Then pass the baton again...

386
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,143
and crawl through the tires.

387
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,483
- That's the most important one. - Then pass the baton...

388
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:57,613
to the last member in front of the slide.

389
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,483
When the last member climbs up and comes down the slide, you win.

390
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,513
- Let's gather our hands. - All right.

391
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:07,283
(They put their hands together with determination.)

392
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,083
- All right. - One, two.

393
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,783
- That was so funny. - Why?

394
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,813
- Gyeong Ree. - Gyeong Ree was...

395
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,943
We did this, and Gyeong Ree...

396
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,943
put her hand from the bottom.

397
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:17,983
Why? Is my hand filthy?

398
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,913
- That's not it. - What was that about?

399
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,983
- My palms are sweaty. - That was too obvious.

400
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,983
- She almost put it on top. - Let's put our hands together.

401
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:25,943
(They try it again.)

402
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,813
(Screaming)

403
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,113
What was that?

404
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:32,043
Do you think my hand is dirty, Gyeong Ree?

405
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,943
- We're on the same team. - It's okay, Gyeong Ree.

406
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,113
- What's wrong? - Gyeong Ree, that wasn't nice!

407
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:38,783
No, I have sweaty hands.

408
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,313
- You have sweaty hands? - What did she do?

409
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:42,643
- She seriously doesn't like him. - We have to be one at heart.

410
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,243
I think I offended somebody.

411
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,013
Let's do a cheer. We have to be one.

412
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,243
- Let's do a cheer! - We're falling apart already.

413
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:49,783
- Isn't this too much? - Let's go.

414
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,713
- One, two, three. Go! - Don't do that.

415
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:52,983
- Let's go. - You go first.

416
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,983
- One, two, three. Go! - One, two, three. Go!

417
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,013
(Blue Team finally does their cheer.)

418
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,183
Who's fast?

419
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:59,443
Then, Kwang Soo should...

420
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,083
Should Kwang Soo and I deflate the tube?

421
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,743
- You should do this one. - It's too hard.

422
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,483
- You can do it. - You should do it for the team.

423
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:06,943
- Today's your day. - You should do hard ones.

424
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,113
- You have to do it. - How do I go on my back?

425
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:10,313
Do this one.

426
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:11,883
- Who will run? - Ki Woo can run.

427
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,243
- He can do it. - Okay, he can run.

428
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,483
- You have to deflate the balloon. - Jong Kook should do it.

429
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,583
I'll do that, then.

430
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,383
- We should do it together. - Then I'll do that.

431
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:21,543
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

432
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:22,743
Beginning's the most important.

433
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:24,013
- Let's go. - Let's go!

434
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:26,613
- We're going to fight desperately. - It might take an hour to finish.

435
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,913
It's too far.

436
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,343
- What's this on the back? - It's a parachute.

437
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,013
Do we run with this?

438
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,043
It's a parachute.

439
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,483
(We're supposed to run with a parachute?)

440
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,343
I picked the wrong one.

441
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,043
- Is that how they should run? - I see.

442
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:43,413
- What's that? - I thought you just run.

443
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:44,743
- This is no joke. - What's that?

444
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:45,813
- Don't they just run? - What's that?

445
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:47,783
- Hey, Gary! - This is no joke.

446
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,343
- Isn't that a parachute? - This is no joke.

447
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,113
- I thought they just run. - They might fly away.

448
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:54,043
Let's go, Pierrot!

449
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:55,883
Let's go, Ki Woo!

450
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:57,583
- Let's go, Ki Woo! - Let's go!

451
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,243
- You have to move forward. - You can do it!

452
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:04,053
(Gary versus Ki Woo)

453
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:06,583
- Let's go! - Let's go!

454
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,283
- Let's go! - Let's go!

455
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,813
- Sparta! - You have to win, Gary!

456
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,943
(The first members are ready to go.)

457
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:18,053
(The first runner is the most important in a relay.)

458
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:22,013
(Gary versus Ki Woo)

459
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,143
Ready!

460
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,443
(Round 1 starts.)

461
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,813
(Flapping)

462
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:33,383
(They both start strong.)

463
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:34,553
- They're flying away. - Come on.

464
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,213
- They'll fly away. - Gary's fast.

465
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:38,383
(It's difficult to move forward with the parachutes on their backs.)

466
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,553
Gary's fast.

467
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,483
(It's difficult even to walk.)

468
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,443
(They clench their teeth and run for their teams.)

469
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,483
Good. We're fast. Ki Woo's fast.

470
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:52,483
(Ki Woo's faster due to his height.)

471
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:53,783
Gary, Gary!

472
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,343
(But the competition is not over yet.)

473
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,443
(Gary chases Ki Woo.)

474
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,553
- He's good. - Good job, Gary!

475
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,243
- Hurry up! - This is it!

476
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,743
Why does Gary look so slow?

477
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,283
- Let's go! - Gary!

478
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:09,983
Gary is good, too.

479
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,283
Good job, Gary!

480
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,013
- You're not far too behind. - We got it.

481
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,183
- Why does Gary look so slow? - Good job, Gary!

482
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,683
- Gary! - Hurry.

483
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,243
- Good job, Gary. - Give me the baton.

484
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,053
- Good job, Gary. - Gary!

485
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,013
- Good job. It's okay. - Pass me the baton!

486
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:26,143
- Give me the baton! - Good job. We're pretty close.

487
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:27,643
I'm done.

488
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:31,213
(The second course starts.)

489
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,883
- Let's go! - Let's start.

490
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,083
I feel like my thighs are going to burst.

491
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,713
Sit on it.

492
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:43,883
Let's go, let's go!

493
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,783
We have to win this round.

494
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,513
(They have contrasting styles.)

495
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,783
Jump faster!

496
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,553
- I don't think it's working. - Jong Kook!

497
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:55,943
- This might not work, Kwang Soo. - Why?

498
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,213
You have to press on it.

499
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:59,613
- Press on it. - Hey, Jae Seok!

500
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,783
- You have to press on it. - Jae Seok, press on the sides.

501
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:04,113
- Press on it. - No, the air's coming out.

502
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:05,943
I think it's faster to press on it.

503
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,313
It is faster that way.

504
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,583
(They look like a bullfrog deflating a tube.)

505
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:14,343
- Can't you fold it now? - We're much faster, Jae Seok.

506
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:15,813
This is no joke.

507
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:17,313
(Are you faster?)

508
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,443
(If that's the case...)

509
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:22,683
It's working.

510
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,113
- Grab the wings. - Hey, hey!

511
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,183
(Jong Kook rips the flamingo open.)

512
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,413
(Deflating)

513
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,313
- What's that? You can't rip it! - He ripped it.

514
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,243
- You can't rip it. - That's not cheating.

515
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,213
- What did you say? - Ripping it is not cheating.

516
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:37,343
- What did you say? - He ripped it.

517
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,913
- My gosh! - You can't do that.

518
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,883
- He ripped it. - You can't do that.

519
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,113
How do you rip it?

520
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,443
Just rip it.

521
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,743
- How... - I can't rip it.

522
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,143
Power!

523
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,483
(Ripping)

524
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,443
(Jae Seok removes a wing.)

525
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:55,843
He's taking the head off.

526
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:58,283
- That looks odd. - Take the wing off.

527
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:01,113
- This is cruel! - Why are you so cruel?

528
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,813
One, two, three!

529
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:04,643
It came off.

530
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:07,743
(They take the head off, too.)

531
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,283
- How do you do this? - You can't use your teeth.

532
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,553
Hey!

533
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:18,213
(They're impressive.)

534
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:19,313
- Throw it. - Hurry, hurry.

535
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:20,783
(Red Team is about to close the lid.)

536
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,053
- Throw it. - Hurry, hurry.

537
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,913
- Throw it. - You can do it!

538
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,943
- Go. - Hurry, hurry.

539
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:28,553
- Hey, hurry! - You're good.

540
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,183
- Switch. - You're good.

541
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:32,613
- Good. - Where's the baton?

542
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,343
- You have to pass the baton. - I did.

543
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:35,443
(Haha digs like a mole.)

544
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,513
- That looks hard. - Gyeong Ree!

545
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:38,943
- Let's go! - Gosh!

546
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:40,143
- Come on. - Gosh.

547
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,683
- Let's go, Seok Jin! - Go in.

548
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,213
(All eyes are on them.)

549
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:45,243
Seok Jin.

550
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,983
- Send the baton first. - Send it over.

551
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,613
- Send it over first. - Put it on your stomach.

552
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:49,843
- Hey. - Send it over.

553
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:52,583
- Put it on your stomach and crawl. - Send it over first.

554
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,783
Watch your cap.

555
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,683
- Good job. - Good. That's big enough.

556
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:59,643
- Let's go. - You have to put your head through.

557
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,553
- Good job. - Watch your head.

558
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,643
- Put your head through. - I think he's stuck.

559
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:08,113
Seok Jin! What are you doing?

560
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:10,913
- You have to dig in front of you. - Hurry, Haha.

561
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:12,983
(Seok Jin! Dig in front of you.)

562
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,553
(This is just too funny.)

563
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:16,943
Haha is about to finish.

564
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,213
(Haha is nearly at the finishing point.)

565
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,443
My goodness.

566
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:24,313
- There's only one hole. - Push me!

567
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:26,053
There's only one hole at the end!

568
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,983
That's good. You're almost done.

569
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,713
- You're done. - Push him harder.

570
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,583
(Haha reaches the exit.)

571
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,313
Seok Jin, hurry up and hold Haha's feet!

572
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,943
- I can't get through. - Do it the other way.

573
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:39,553
Hurry, hurry.

574
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:42,083
- Come on. - Go, go!

575
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,183
- Let's stop playing. - Go!

576
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,113
(Haha hands the baton to Nichkhun.)

577
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,883
- Should we give up? - You can't go.

578
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,543
- Hurry. - What's that?

579
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,783
What's that?

580
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:52,813
(He manages to escape.)

581
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,483
- Gyeong Ree! - Look at her.

582
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:55,913
Stand your ground, Gyeong Ree!

583
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,183
- Gyeong Ree! - Oh, gosh.

584
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,243
He's too fast.

585
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:04,143
(He's super fast.)

586
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:06,183
- I wish this is a test run. - You're not even close.

587
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:09,143
- What's this mess? - Try going through.

588
00:22:09,643 --> 00:22:11,013
(Gasping)

589
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,183
(Sliding)

590
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,543
(He's relaxed.)

591
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:20,043
(Hopping)

592
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:25,543
(Red Team wins thanks to their best players.)

593
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,843
- I'm sorry, Gyeong Ree. - You didn't even get to play.

594
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,283
- I told you I can't do this. - That wasn't intense at all.

595
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:31,913
I'm sorry, Gyeong Ree!

596
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,143
- I was supposed to dig here. - I know why you got mad.

597
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:35,913
- You're supposed to dig near it. - You should have told me.

598
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:38,283
I told you like five times! I told you to dig near it.

599
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:40,143
- You should have told me. - That's what I was saying.

600
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:42,443
- We kept on telling you! - We said it like five times.

601
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,243
- You're supposed to dig here. - You need to dig here.

602
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,883
You're supposed to dig here.

603
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,813
I'll do this one.

604
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,243
- Try it. - Do it, Gyeong Ree.

605
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,713
- She was frustrated. - She's mad.

606
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:52,383
- We're sorry, Gyeong Ree. - It's okay.

607
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,613
- Gyeong Ree. - Let's go!

608
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,643
Okay!

609
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:55,783
You don't care because you have gloves on.

610
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,483
- I have gloves on. - One, two, three. Go!

611
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:58,813
Let's win this one.

612
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,843
- You're no match for us. - Just watch.

613
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,513
Let's just flog them.

614
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:05,183
- Just you wait. - Come on!

615
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,413
- You got lucky with your team. - This isn't fun at all.

616
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,343
- Watch where you put your foot. - What?

617
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:12,343
- Where are you putting it on? - There's nothing wrong with it.

618
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:14,083
- For goodness' sake. - What's there to complain?

619
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,143
Take your foot off.

620
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:17,113
(Staggering)

621
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,343
- See? He's losing balance. - You almost sprained your ankle.

622
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:22,813
- That hurt my pride. - I thought you were Shim Hyung Rae.

623
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,683
That hurt my pride. You try it.

624
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,383
- Hey, take your foot off. - Why?

625
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,783
Listen when I say it nicely.

626
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:30,413
- He won't budge. - Hey.

627
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,913
- He's driving me insane. - Just do this!

628
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:36,913
(Kwang Soo kicks him in the groin.)

629
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,443
That's how you're supposed to do it!

630
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:40,913
Why were you trying to do it like this?

631
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,213
- That's how you do it. - I was just showing an example.

632
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,883
- I'm just showing them an example. - This guy.

633
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,883
- Don't overreact. - Good job, Kwang Soo.

634
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:46,943
That's just another way.

635
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,813
Kwang Soo has anger management issues.

636
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:51,513
- I can't stand him. He angers me. - He's just like that.

637
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:55,083
Red Team takes the first mission.

638
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:57,943
- Let's overtake them. - We have three rounds.

639
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,213
- It's best 2 out of 3. - This is just 1 round.

640
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,983
- Do you understand how this works? - Yes.

641
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,983
- Only now? - We get it now.

642
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:09,643
Before you return to your positions, let me call out the team leaders.

643
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,113
- Sure. - Sure.

644
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:12,413
- Just them? - What is it?

645
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,243
- There's something going on. - There is.

646
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:17,943
Why do you give this to us in front of the other members?

647
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:20,313
- What's that? - They keep asking us about it.

648
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:21,883
- What is it? - You lose if you give it away.

649
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,913
(You lose if you give it away.)

650
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,013
- You can't say it. - This is ridiculous!

651
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:28,413
- What's this? - We lose if you tell us?

652
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,543
- Oh, my. - What is it?

653
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:32,513
Are you a spy? What was all that about?

654
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:35,813
- Are you a spy? - We thought we were a team.

655
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:36,883
- This guy! - Come on.

656
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,243
- What is it? - You're making me grab your collar.

657
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:42,043
- There's something going on. - There's something we don't know.

658
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,813
- There's something going on. - Look at them.

659
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,243
Our team members are bad in games but good at speculating.

660
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,283
- Let's just go. - Do we rip name tags?

661
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,583
Ki Woo and Nichkhun aren't asking any questions.

662
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,243
- Their team... - Look at them.

663
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:52,783
Shouldn't we take his shoes off?

664
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,883
- I know, there's something. - There's nothing!

665
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:57,513
- This is good for us, right? - Of course, it is.

666
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,083
We know how this goes so focus on the game.

667
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,213
- All right. - Don't doubt anything.

668
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,513
- Let's get ready. - Me?

669
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:03,843
What's going on?

670
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,513
- Kwang Soo! - Let's go!

671
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:09,143
(Let's go...)

672
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:12,643
(Blue Team fails the mission.)

673
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,683
What's wrong?

674
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:18,383
- Let's go! - What? Why are you giggling?

675
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:20,713
- Why are you giggling? - Is something going on?

676
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,943
- What is it? - This look fishy.

677
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:25,043
- I'm going to lose it. - What is it?

678
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:27,383
- What? - My goodness.

679
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,413
What is it?

680
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:31,113
All right. Let's start.

681
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:32,543
Let get started.

682
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:35,083
- What? - My gosh.

683
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,613
- There's something going on. - What's wrong with him?

684
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,483
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, Blue Team has lost the mission.)

685
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,013
("Beach Relay", Round 2)

686
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:44,213
Let's go!

687
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,383
(Kwang Soo versus Nichkhun)

688
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:50,683
(Running)

689
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,343
- Oh, my gosh. - Go, Kwang Soo!

690
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,343
Come on.

691
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:56,083
You're good. You're doing well.

692
00:25:56,113 --> 00:25:57,943
(Who will win? Long with long limbs or athletic Nick?)

693
00:25:57,943 --> 00:25:59,313
Kwang Soo is fast.

694
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,013
- Go, Kwang Soo! - Kwang Soo is good.

695
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:02,043
He's quite good.

696
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:04,743
- You're altering the wind's course. - Good. Kwang Soo is doing well.

697
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,843
Kwang Soo is good.

698
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:07,013
(Long is slightly ahead.)

699
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:08,243
- This way. - Kwang Soo is doing well.

700
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:09,513
(I'm pretty good at running.)

701
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:11,483
Kwang Soo doesn't look so attractive running.

702
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,983
(Good at running versus good looking)

703
00:26:14,743 --> 00:26:16,483
(They arrive at the second spot about the same time.)

704
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:18,643
- Put it over your shoulder. - Take the air out of the tube.

705
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,683
We can do this!

706
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:22,313
- Take the air out. - Take the air out. Hurry.

707
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:23,883
- I'm exhausted. - Hey!

708
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:24,913
(Ripping)

709
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:26,113
- Wow, look. - You should rip it, too.

710
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:29,143
(It's like they are ripping the wings off a chicken.)

711
00:26:29,943 --> 00:26:31,313
- How should I grab this? - Here. Grab here.

712
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:32,883
(They are all ripping the tube.)

713
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:33,943
Rip it off!

714
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,983
- Go! - Here. We can rip each parts off.

715
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:37,843
That's so great!

716
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:40,013
(He looks really brutal and manly.)

717
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,213
That's amazing.

718
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,383
- Show me a heart sign. - Don't take your eyes off. Focus.

719
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:46,213
All right, I'm done. I'm finished.

720
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:49,283
- Gyeong Ree says you are amazing. - Of course I am.

721
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:51,183
(Red Team is almost finished.)

722
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:52,383
We're done!

723
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,813
- Okay. - Let's put this in.

724
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,543
- Put this inside here. - Go, guys.

725
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,113
(Blue Team's tube still has plenty of air in it.)

726
00:26:58,113 --> 00:26:59,113
Hey, come on.

727
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:00,443
(Packaging completed)

728
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:01,843
- You're doing great. - Hurry up.

729
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,013
Okay. It's done.

730
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,543
- No! - How can they do it so fast?

731
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:06,383
(Team Red is ready to start the third course.)

732
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:09,283
- Sorry, Gyeong Ree. - My goodness. What should I do?

733
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:10,643
Put the baton in first.

734
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:13,343
(We're almost there.)

735
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:16,843
- That's it. Dig around the tire. - Oh, gosh.

736
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:18,513
- Give me the baton for a second. - My gosh.

737
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,813
Yes, I think you can. You can crawl underneath now.

738
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,143
- Go, Gyeong Ree - The hole's big enough.

739
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,513
You can crawl underneath now.

740
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:25,543
- Good. - Go, Gyeong Ree.

741
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,143
- She got it. - Great.

742
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,213
Good. You're doing well.

743
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:30,313
- I can hold it for you. - Good. You can go in.

744
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,943
(She surely knows how to crawl.)

745
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:35,883
(G.I. Ji Hyo crawls and proceeds without hesitation.)

746
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:36,983
Wow. Good job.

747
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,143
- Awesome. - Go. Go and grab her.

748
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:41,783
(Gyeong Ree finally catches up and starts to chase Ji Hyo.)

749
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:42,983
- Hurry up, Ji Hyo. - Hurry.

750
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,983
- Grab her, Gyeong Ree. - Go, Gyeong Ree.

751
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,683
- Grab her ankle. - Let go of me!

752
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:49,283
(Ji Hyo kicks Gyeong Ree fiercely.)

753
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:50,413
Go away!

754
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:52,083
- Gyeong Ree, grab her from behind. - Catch her.

755
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,413
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo!

756
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:54,743
- Come on. - Grab her tightly.

757
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:56,343
- Just push her away. - I'm sorry, Ji Hyo!

758
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,143
I'm sorry.

759
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,083
- Come out. Hurry. - Gyeong Ree, crawl out.

760
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,113
Ji Hyo, hurry up. Come on out.

761
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:05,313
- Go. Hurry. - Come on, Gyeong Ree.

762
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:06,583
- His microphone! - Look at the microphone.

763
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,443
- You're nearly there. - Which way?

764
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:09,713
Hey, Ki Woo.

765
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:11,443
(Blue Team just has passed the second tire.)

766
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:12,643
Hurry up, Ki Woo!

767
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:15,813
(Will Red Team take their victory like this?)

768
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:20,543
(If we lose again, the first round goes to them.)

769
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,943
(I won't let that happen.)

770
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:23,683
- Hey, Ki Woo. - Easy, Ki Woo. Go easy.

771
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,783
Ki Woo!

772
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:26,943
He's chasing you, Ki Woo!

773
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,313
- He's chasing you. - Give me that baton.

774
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:30,343
(Grabbing)

775
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:31,983
(Jae Seok grabs his ankle.)

776
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,043
(Sliding)

777
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,083
(Jae Seok is doing his best to stop him.)

778
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,813
- Can he do that? - Is that possible?

779
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,913
Jae Seok. Here!

780
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,713
Go, Jae Seok. Just go.

781
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:42,183
(Blue Team's baton has arrived just in time.)

782
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,683
(The game isn't over yet. It has just begun.)

783
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,613
- I'm exhausted. - Let's do this.

784
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:50,213
No, we can't lose this!

785
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:52,343
- That's right. - We have to win this.

786
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:56,513
(Ki Woo is tired already. Jae Seok easily dominates him.)

787
00:28:56,813 --> 00:28:58,343
- Hurry up. - Oh, no.

788
00:28:58,683 --> 00:28:59,683
(Jae Seok is really fast.)

789
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,713
Wow. Jae Seok is really good.

790
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:04,543
(What's going on?)

791
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,143
- What's going on? - Wow. Look at Jae Seok.

792
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,513
(Jae Seok gets to the top at once.)

793
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:08,613
He's almost there.

794
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,883
He's nearly there. We got this.

795
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:11,983
(Slipping)

796
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:14,843
Okay!

797
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,583
(Experienced Jae Seok overwhelmed Ki Woo with his skills.)

798
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:29,313
(Blue Team has won the second round.)

799
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:30,613
Well done, Jae Seok.

800
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:31,683
Good job.

801
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,413
(Our leader is the best.)

802
00:29:34,183 --> 00:29:35,213
Well done.

803
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:38,213
Anyway, Jae Seok...

804
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,343
which one is more important? This game or the secret mission?

805
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,243
- Stop asking. - I'm really curious.

806
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:44,283
- I really want to know. - We won the game anyway.

807
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,883
Look. They are not curious about it at all.

808
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:48,183
Is it because the mission was not important at all?

809
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:49,213
(Only the Blue Team is full of doubts.)

810
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:50,243
Just tell us.

811
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:51,943
- That's not important. - Then just tell me.

812
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:53,343
Which is more important? Game or the secret mission?

813
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,883
The game is more important, of course.

814
00:29:54,883 --> 00:29:57,243
Why do you keep giving us the mission in front of them?

815
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,913
- He just said, "the mission". - So is that really a mission?

816
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:01,513
- Mission? - You said "the mission".

817
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,643
It's not that mission.

818
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:04,283
- What are you talking about? - Was it really a mission?

819
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:06,943
There is definitely a mission. We ate the ice cream earlier.

820
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:08,813
We're just afraid of him and can ask what it is about.

821
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,343
- We're aware of it, though. - Let me tell you one thing.

822
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:12,483
You ruined everything. Everything.

823
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,343
- What was it about? - Our team members are doing well.

824
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:16,513
I mean, really well.

825
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,913
Can't you tell us?

826
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:20,283
(I want to ask him, but he looks so scary.)

827
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:21,813
Blue Team has won the second round.

828
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,213
That was a worthless victory and you know it.

829
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,943
That mission thing is a complete nonsense, anyway.

830
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,583
What? What about the mission?

831
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,183
- I get it. Today, it's all about... - Close your eyes for a second.

832
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,213
It's not a team game. Today's game is an individual one.

833
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:35,743
- Seok Jin... - No, it's not.

834
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:37,113
- It is. I know it. - No, it's a team game.

835
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:38,283
It's not what you think.

836
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:40,743
(Suspicious lifeguards are becoming more suspicious.)

837
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,743
- Choose your players for a run-off. - Okay.

838
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,213
What is our plan?

839
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,683
Let's not rip the tube this time. Okay?

840
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,843
- Let's just deflate it. - Yes, let's do that.

841
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,683
- So we'll take the air out only. - Yes. Don't rip it this time.

842
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,813
Okay, I got it.

843
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:53,113
It's good to win this game, isn't it?

844
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:54,313
Yes, it is.

845
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:55,783
But I think...

846
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,583
maybe this game is meaningless after all.

847
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,843
(They have no idea what's going on.)

848
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:00,583
(Kwang Soo, please!)

849
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:02,143
(Kwang Soo, my man.)

850
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:04,813
- Let's go! - Ready!

851
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,213
(The Final Round)

852
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:09,913
Gosh.

853
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:13,743
(Kwang Soo versus Ki Woo)

854
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,043
He's really good at running.

855
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:17,143
(Tall men's race begins.)

856
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,943
- Both are really good. - Ki Woo runs quite fast, too.

857
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,383
- Both are good. - Both of them are strong.

858
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:22,043
(Who will win this match? Will Kwang Soo win?)

859
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:23,843
(Or will the guest, Ki Woo, win?)

860
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:25,413
Both of them are strong.

861
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,813
Kwang Soo is faster. He's faster.

862
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:29,143
(Marching of the Titans)

863
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:30,413
Kwang Soo is faster.

864
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:33,113
(It's really a close match.)

865
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,583
It must be really hard to run like that.

866
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:36,743
Good job.

867
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:39,883
(They begin to deflate the dolphin tubes.)

868
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:42,443
Well done, Kwang Soo.

869
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,183
(Gosh. I'm so tired.)

870
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:45,343
I'm so exhausted.

871
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:49,283
- Press the tube with your knees. - Keep pressing it.

872
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,383
- Just keep pressing it. - I need your heart cheering.

873
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:53,743
- You need to keep pressing it. - Really?

874
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:54,913
(Seok Jin's hopping actually delayed Blue Team.)

875
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,943
They're already doing that way.

876
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:57,113
(Red Team is pressing the tube already.)

877
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:58,143
We lost already.

878
00:31:58,743 --> 00:32:00,543
- It's really slow. - Come on. Please.

879
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:02,513
(Then I'll...)

880
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:04,043
- I'm really tired. - You must be.

881
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,513
(I'm so tired. I want to lean on the dolphin.)

882
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:09,543
(Kwang Soo joined the cheating.)

883
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:10,913
I'm so tired.

884
00:32:10,913 --> 00:32:12,383
(I'll join, too.)

885
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:15,143
(Both teams are trying to deflate the tube as quickly as possible.)

886
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,643
- Press it. - I'm so tired.

887
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,613
- Is the air coming out now? - I'm so tired.

888
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,683
- Kwang Soo, you're leaning on me. - Seok Jin.

889
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:21,713
(What is he doing?)

890
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,983
(Kwang Soo is scratching the tube to make a hole.)

891
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:27,443
(Tearing)

892
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:31,083
- Hey, that was strangely quick. - No, that was all right.

893
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,243
(That was strangely fast, wasn't it?)

894
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,483
- Come on. Move up. - It's done.

895
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:35,883
(With Kwang Soo cheating,)

896
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:36,883
(Blue Team's tube is fully deflated.)

897
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,443
- No way. I'll do the same. - Let's go. Hurry.

898
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:39,543
- Let's go. - What are you doing?

899
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,543
- Gosh. - We're already late.

900
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,543
- Hurry up. - Grab it.

901
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,783
Good. We're on the right track.

902
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:44,683
(Both teams end up ripping the tubes.)

903
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:45,913
- It's done. - Go. Hurry.

904
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,383
- Hurry up. - Go, Gyeong Ree.

905
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,943
- Hurry up. - We must win this, Gyeong Ree.

906
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,013
Take your time.

907
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:51,613
- You can do it, Gyeong Ree. - Gyeong Ree, come on!

908
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:52,843
Please, Gyeong Ree!

909
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,043
(We'll win this time.)

910
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:56,283
- Go, Gyeong Ree. - Hurry!

911
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,713
- Come on, Gyeong Ree. - Crawl in.

912
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,583
- That's it. - Good job!

913
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:00,983
(Ji Hyo the Red Song follows her fiercely.)

914
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:02,143
(Gyeong Ree crawls in.)

915
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:03,313
- Good. - You're fast.

916
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,313
You're really fast.

917
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:06,113
- You're doing well, Gyeong Ree. - Come on. You can crawl in now.

918
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:07,113
- Good. - You're fast.

919
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:08,413
- You're doing well, Gyeong Ree. - Come on. You can crawl in now.

920
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:10,683
(Gyeong Ree raises her pace.)

921
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:13,213
- You are doing well. - We got this.

922
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,743
- You must come out. - She's not out yet.

923
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:19,383
(Gyeong Ree hasn't come out yet, but Gary tries to run with baton.)

924
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:21,513
- You must wait for her to come out. - You must wait.

925
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,283
- Not yet. - Wait for Gyeong Ree.

926
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,083
(Gyeong Ree crawls out.)

927
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,683
- Gosh. - Hold on, Gyeong Ree.

928
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:29,143
(But it's no use. Gary is in the air now.)

929
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:30,283
- Gosh. - Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

930
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,943
- My ribs! - Hurry, Ji Hyo.

931
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:34,113
(Ji Hyo crawls out.)

932
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,213
- We must stop him. - My ribs hurt.

933
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,213
- Hey. - All right. It's time.

934
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,283
(Gary versus Jong Kook)

935
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,613
What are you doing? Where is the baton?

936
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:39,743
Here. This way.

937
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:41,943
- Go for it! - Go, Gary!

938
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,143
Gary. Oh, No!

939
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:47,183
(Gary slips all of a sudden.)

940
00:33:47,683 --> 00:33:50,013
(Because of Gary's mistake, Red Team is ahead now.)

941
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:51,813
Hey, no!

942
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:53,683
(My gosh...)

943
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:55,743
- Grab the rope. - Come on, Gary.

944
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,143
(This will the turning point of this race.)

945
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:03,283
(Who will be able to climb up the Suspicious Hill first?)

946
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:08,713
(Will it be Gary or Jong Kook?)

947
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,113
(Flinching)

948
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,713
(Jong Kook is in danger!)

949
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:16,583
(Jong Kook flinches.)

950
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:20,513
(Will Gary be able to turn the game around, again?)

951
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:22,483
Run for it, Gary!

952
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:24,283
(They're quite close.)

953
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:26,143
(Slipping)

954
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,713
No. Gary!

955
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:29,843
(Gary, no!)

956
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:32,843
- No. Gary! - Please!

957
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:34,953
(Jong Kook manages to run down the hill first...)

958
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:37,383
(because of Gary's mistake.)

959
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:40,453
(No!)

960
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,483
- No! - We got this!

961
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:46,343
We'll be flogged today.

962
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:47,683
(I think I'll be flogged today.)

963
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:48,783
I'll be flogged.

964
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,513
(The relay is over!)

965
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:53,543
Gary.

966
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,213
Did you lose?

967
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:57,513
(He shakes his head.)

968
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,083
Did you win?

969
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:00,483
- Really? - Did we win?

970
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,013
- Really? - What?

971
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:04,643
- Did he win? - How did you lose?

972
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:05,643
Gary!

973
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,313
- Really? - What happened?

974
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:09,453
- Is it true, Gary? - Yes.

975
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,413
- Come here. - In 1, 2, 3. Yes!

976
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,413
Really?

977
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:14,213
- Kang Gary! - How did you win, anyway?

978
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,613
(What happened?)

979
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:19,783
(Jong Kook was ahead of the race when he jumped down the slide.)

980
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:24,453
(Running)

981
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:28,683
(Oh no, my baton!)

982
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:32,483
(Jong Kook drops the baton at a crucial moment.)

983
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:38,643
(In an instant,)

984
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,783
(Gary scores first.)

985
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:42,783
I lost.

986
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,043
Didn't we win?

987
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,383
Did we not win?

988
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:48,083
(Gary of Blue Team gets lucky and wins.)

989
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,313
How could you drop it?

990
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:51,983
I dropped it.

991
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:54,113
- That was great. - I made a mistake.

992
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,913
Gary, good job.

993
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:57,343
My heart is about to burst.

994
00:35:57,453 --> 00:35:58,513
Blue Team wins.

995
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,243
(Blue Team wins the "Beach Relay" with a score of 2 to 1.)

996
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,883
- We got lucky in the end. - That was great.

997
00:36:02,883 --> 00:36:05,643
I can't believe this.

998
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,113
Team leaders, please step forward.

999
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:08,713
- Again? - We'll get another mission.

1000
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,383
Don't call us out in public.

1001
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,483
- They'll give us a mission. - Goodness.

1002
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,883
- It's the third mission. - I'll tell you quietly.

1003
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,683
- How could Jong Kook lose? - He could have lost on purpose.

1004
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,343
- What is it? - I'm also curious.

1005
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,213
I'm very curious.

1006
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:26,813
- Okay. - Is this the mission?

1007
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:29,883
How could you give us such a mission?

1008
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,743
- It must be a mission. - Well...

1009
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:33,283
You said, "How is this a mission?"

1010
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:35,953
Are we just pawns in a competition between you two?

1011
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:37,913
- Definitely not. - What are we?

1012
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:39,913
- Aren't we also participating? - Are we pawns?

1013
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,683
- What are we? - What does that make us?

1014
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,383
Ki Woo, that's a misunderstanding.

1015
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,143
- It's a misunderstanding. - It's not like we don't know.

1016
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,343
Just answer this.

1017
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:49,213
Is what they're doing more important than what the rest of us are doing?

1018
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:51,213
- Which one? - I wish we were more important.

1019
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:53,343
- This hurts my feelings. - Come on.

1020
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:56,643
- I... - Which one is more fun?

1021
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:58,283
Are we on Running Man or The Two Men?

1022
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,383
- No. - Goodness.

1023
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,583
The main actor has been Kwang Soo all this time.

1024
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:03,953
What about me?

1025
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,643
Kwang Soo has played a crucial part so far.

1026
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:09,483
- Do you remember that? - I haven't done anything.

1027
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:11,013
He said you've been the main actor.

1028
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,243
I haven't done anything.

1029
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,613
(What is the reason?)

1030
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:18,683
(Blue Team: 20, Red Team: 10)

1031
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:20,513
(Special training to become the best rescuing team continues.)

1032
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:22,113
- Let's go. - We're ready.

1033
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:23,183
(Special training to become the best rescuing team continues.)

1034
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:27,113
Let's go and finish it quickly!

1035
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:28,783
The camera is on now.

1036
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,083
- Look at all the people. - One, two, three.

1037
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,143
- Yes! - That was amazing.

1038
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:34,413
Was that a mission?

1039
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,783
- That looked like a mission. - It wasn't.

1040
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:39,013
It seems like Jae Seok finished a mission successfully.

1041
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:41,613
- No. - Pardon me, but when I'm resting,

1042
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:44,083
please stop looking at me in a weird way.

1043
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,513
- We didn't. - Don't poke me either.

1044
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,583
- We have to find it. - It's about this size.

1045
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,343
We won't betray our team members,

1046
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:52,343
- so relax. - In your team,

1047
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:54,043
- Relax. - Ki Woo and Nichkhun...

1048
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,683
- don't care about that at all. - It's because they're afraid.

1049
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:59,043
- No, they trust me. - I can't even be suspicious of him.

1050
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,243
- In my opinion, - They trust the team leader.

1051
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:03,453
Haha keeps being suspicious of you, but those two look scared.

1052
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,513
I'm trying to stimulate them, but no one is following me.

1053
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,643
- Why aren't you two suspicious? - They just trust me.

1054
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:09,453
Ki Woo, why aren't you suspicious of him?

1055
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:11,343
- It's frustrating. - I saw it already.

1056
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:13,513
- What did you see? - I saw your stomach.

1057
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,783
What are you doing?

1058
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:16,683
- He's hiding it somewhere there. - We don't have anything.

1059
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:18,143
It's in his shoes.

1060
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:20,183
Ki Woo gave up everything...

1061
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,583
and only wants to be paid.

1062
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,113
He wants to be paid.

1063
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,043
We don't have to worry about not getting paid.

1064
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,313
- Don't worry about that. - He asked me very seriously.

1065
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,413
I'd like to say something but I can't.

1066
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,953
Ki Woo has changed a lot compared to before.

1067
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,743
I like how he's become more realistic.

1068
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,113
This training is to test one's strength.

1069
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,913
It's called "Wear the Socks".

1070
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,013
- I love strength tests. - I can't believe this.

1071
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:44,183
It's a one-to-one competition.

1072
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:47,743
Both players pull the rope while being inside tubes.

1073
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:50,383
The player who puts on all the wet socks...

1074
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:52,343
in the bowl wins.

1075
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,513
The first team to score three points wins.

1076
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:57,513
I'd like to know...

1077
00:38:57,953 --> 00:39:01,113
if this game is more important than the team leaders' mission.

1078
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,683
- The game is more important. - What does that make us?

1079
00:39:03,953 --> 00:39:06,383
- Goodness. - Which is more important?

1080
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:08,013
Which is more important?

1081
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,843
- Which is more important? - Is it the game or the leaders?

1082
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:14,013
- What's more important? - This is driving me crazy.

1083
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:17,143
- Gary, that's not right. - Stop it.

1084
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:19,713
- Kwang Soo, you can do it! - Okay.

1085
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,953
The next player is Ki Woo!

1086
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:22,953
Yes.

1087
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,213
Ji Hyo, step forward.

1088
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:25,813
Players of similar height should contend.

1089
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:28,143
- Be like him to be tall. - Come on.

1090
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:31,243
We want to be tall like Ki Woo, but not like Kwang Soo.

1091
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:36,413
That looks like some kind of sign.

1092
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:37,453
Did you do something to me?

1093
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:40,113
- Did you do something? - It's a slapping mission.

1094
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:41,953
Did you do something?

1095
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:43,413
- He missed the last slap. - What's wrong with you?

1096
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,083
- I dodged the last one. - Why don't you try it?

1097
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,643
- He only slapped me twice. - No!

1098
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:48,343
- You're driving me crazy! - Don't be easy on him.

1099
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:49,953
Do I need to slap you back?

1100
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:52,953
No, that wasn't a mission.

1101
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,083
- Was that a mission? - This is driving me nuts.

1102
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,143
Gosh, I want to know.

1103
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,613
- Gary, that's not it. - What are you doing?

1104
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,143
Protect your cheeks.

1105
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:02,683
- Wait a minute. - I'm already infected.

1106
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,183
Be suspicious of Jong Kook, too, guys!

1107
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:07,453
Just relax.

1108
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:08,683
Let's be suspicious!

1109
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:10,213
You're the only one being suspicious.

1110
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,513
- Let him be suspicious. - I think he did something to me!

1111
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,413
Stop it.

1112
00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:16,583
Even Gyeong Ree is suspicious of me.

1113
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,883
- Don't slap me. - Let's start the competition.

1114
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,453
- Please win. - Do it without your shoes on.

1115
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:22,983
(Sighing)

1116
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:25,143
Ki Woo seems very worried.

1117
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:26,643
I haven't talked for too long.

1118
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:30,383
Ki Woo said,

1119
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:32,513
"It's really hard for me."

1120
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,783
- We're only starting. - Take off your shoes.

1121
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:37,383
His role in "The Classic" was a boy who collapsed all the time.

1122
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:39,143
That's right.

1123
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:41,213
He's collapsing.

1124
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:43,243
- He's collapsing. - What's wrong with you?

1125
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:44,713
Why did you collapse so fast?

1126
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:47,883
- What's wrong? - In the movie "The Classic"?

1127
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,783
("The Classic", 2003)

1128
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:51,983
(He collapsed...)

1129
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:55,513
(and collapsed.)

1130
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:58,183
(He collapsed whenever he got the chance.)

1131
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:00,453
- What's wrong? - In the movie "The Classic"?

1132
00:41:00,453 --> 00:41:02,083
You kept collapsing.

1133
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,813
I feel dizzy whenever that movie is mentioned.

1134
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:05,543
He always collapsed in the movie.

1135
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,613
To me, you are

1136
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,643
Like the sunset

1137
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,343
- Like the sunset - He collapsed again.

1138
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,113
Like the sunset

1139
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:14,383
Please step forward.

1140
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,953
All right.

1141
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,083
Don't do that.

1142
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,213
You can do it!

1143
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,453
(The first round of a game is always important.)

1144
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:24,043
(Who will wear the three socks first?)

1145
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,043
- You can do it! - Get ready.

1146
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:29,283
Kwang Soo!

1147
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,643
(He pulls him all the way.)

1148
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:33,813
What's going on today?

1149
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:34,913
He's doing well.

1150
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,083
- What's going on today? - He's doing well.

1151
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,813
Kwang Soo, you should pull too.

1152
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:42,613
(Thanks to Gyeong Ree's cheer, Kwang Soo regains energy.)

1153
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:46,453
- Come on. - Grab one sock.

1154
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:47,643
(Ki Woo easily grabs his first sock.)

1155
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:50,383
- Good. - Follow him to get tall.

1156
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,613
You're doing well, Kwang Soo.

1157
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:56,143
- Bend your body. - You're doing well, Kwang Soo.

1158
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:58,243
- Lay your body down. - Good.

1159
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,283
(Kwang Soo also gets his sock.)

1160
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:03,983
- Good! - Go, Kwang Soo!

1161
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:07,313
- Sit down. - You're doing well.

1162
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:09,513
Get closer.

1163
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:10,643
Good.

1164
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,083
- Use your strength. - Good.

1165
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,743
(He throws water at him instead since he's not as strong.)

1166
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:18,583
Hurry and put the sock on.

1167
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,413
Kwang Soo, you're doing well.

1168
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:22,583
- Kwang Soo. - It's over here.

1169
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,143
- Good job, Kwang Soo. - The water is dripping.

1170
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:27,143
- Come on. - Kwang Soo.

1171
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:30,013
- Put one on. - I'll put it on.

1172
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,813
- Kwang Soo. - Keep the shoes on.

1173
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:35,453
- Kwang Soo, move! - You can win.

1174
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,283
Kwang Soo, hurry and put in on.

1175
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,343
Kwang Soo.

1176
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:39,453
(Kwang Soo puts on his second stockings.)

1177
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,543
Kwang Soo.

1178
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,143
- No. - He hasn't put it on yet.

1179
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:45,953
He hasn't put it on yet.

1180
00:42:45,953 --> 00:42:47,783
(Ki Woo only has one more to go.)

1181
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:51,483
(Kwang Soo also grabs for his last one.)

1182
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,743
- No! - He hasn't put all of them on yet.

1183
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,113
He did it!

1184
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,313
Kwang Soo.

1185
00:42:58,313 --> 00:43:00,983
(He celebrates his victory by showing off his leg.)

1186
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:02,713
He looks like a synchronised swimmer.

1187
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:05,413
- My leg is cramping. - His leg is cramping!

1188
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:10,743
(He went overboard with his celebration.)

1189
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:14,013
Like the sunset

1190
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:15,543
It becomes a beautiful memory

1191
00:43:16,453 --> 00:43:18,513
- Good job. - He's...

1192
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:20,743
He's really funny.

1193
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:23,683
He's an entertaining actor.

1194
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:25,343
I've told you about Ki Woo.

1195
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:27,913
He used to play the role of Kwang Soo before.

1196
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:31,543
- I'm the old giraffe. - Kwang Soo is the new giraffe.

1197
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,243
All right, next up is Gyeong Ree!

1198
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:36,443
- Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

1199
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,243
Do we play with water on the mat?

1200
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,543
- Why did you splash so much water? - The beginning is important.

1201
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:43,443
- Do we play with water on the mat? - Why did you splash so much water?

1202
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:44,513
The beginning is important.

1203
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,083
(What is that?)

1204
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:48,883
- What is that? - It's really hot.

1205
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:50,683
- Why did you splash so much water? - Are they for us to drink?

1206
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:51,943
Will you play with shoes on?

1207
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:54,213
(What's the truth behind these mysterious water bottles?)

1208
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:57,443
We'll give you water in the middle of the competition.

1209
00:43:57,443 --> 00:44:00,183
- Okay. - If you drink it first, you lose.

1210
00:44:01,783 --> 00:44:02,983
- Okay. - Is that the mission?

1211
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,683
Are you kidding? I haven't seen you in a while but...

1212
00:44:06,983 --> 00:44:08,443
- Goodness. - That's good.

1213
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:11,843
(This is the team leaders' mission.)

1214
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:13,613
- What is this? - It's really hot.

1215
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,513
- What is this? - It's really hot.

1216
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:18,783
(Jae Seok is cleaning the mat.)

1217
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:22,783
- Why did you splash so much water? - Are they for us to drink?

1218
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:28,113
(He hands the water to someone.)

1219
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:30,483
Can you bring it?

1220
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,113
(He takes a shot of cool water.)

1221
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:35,443
I'll wipe off the sand.

1222
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:37,713
- I'll do it. - It's okay.

1223
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,743
(In 5 seconds, Blue Team fails.)

1224
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:42,413
- I'm hot. - You can stay off the mat.

1225
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,443
Stay off the mat.

1226
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:46,143
- Jae Seok, stop it. - I'm wiping off the sand.

1227
00:44:46,813 --> 00:44:49,083
- Don't do anything. - Stop him.

1228
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,583
- Stop him. - Don't do anything.

1229
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:52,283
Break his arms.

1230
00:44:53,183 --> 00:44:55,413
Goodness, this is frustrating.

1231
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,643
I'm too stressed to do this any more.

1232
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:58,943
- I'm too stressed. - Jae Seok.

1233
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:01,343
- Are you playing solo? - Gosh, I'm going crazy.

1234
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:02,583
He's the only one busy.

1235
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,283
Team leaders, please step forward...

1236
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:05,543
- Okay. - before the competition starts.

1237
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:06,813
- You should be at an advantage. - What is it?

1238
00:45:07,043 --> 00:45:08,543
What is it again?

1239
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:11,283
- Are you receiving orders again? - It's the main competition.

1240
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:13,743
It's different from the competition.

1241
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,813
We'll let you know about the losing team.

1242
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:18,213
I can't do it any more due to stress.

1243
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:20,713
My team's giving me too much stress.

1244
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:22,713
Too many of them are suspicious.

1245
00:45:22,943 --> 00:45:24,383
We brought water,

1246
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,813
- and Seok Jin drank it first. - Goodness.

1247
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,683
Please tell him about that.

1248
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:31,783
Okay.

1249
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:34,713
- Please decide who's next. - What is it?

1250
00:45:34,883 --> 00:45:36,613
- Gosh. - Okay.

1251
00:45:36,613 --> 00:45:38,683
Why do you always lose?

1252
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:41,743
Our team members are impatient.

1253
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:44,643
Although they're so nice,

1254
00:45:44,643 --> 00:45:47,013
they're impatient.

1255
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:48,883
- Gosh, Jae Seok. - You can't say that to us.

1256
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:49,943
You'll see.

1257
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:51,743
- This is driving me crazy. - What's wrong with you?

1258
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,643
I can't stand it any more.

1259
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:55,783
- This is driving me crazy. - Why?

1260
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:56,783
Who is it?

1261
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:57,783
- What did he say? - Gosh.

1262
00:45:57,783 --> 00:46:00,113
- Why do you keep dropping down? - This is so hard.

1263
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:01,843
There must be something wrong.

1264
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,513
He's doing fine, but what's the matter with you?

1265
00:46:04,783 --> 00:46:06,343
Why do you keep dropping down?

1266
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:07,813
- Please calm down. - Gosh.

1267
00:46:07,813 --> 00:46:10,613
Why do you think it's unfavourable for us when we won the last round?

1268
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:12,543
Just trust us.

1269
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:13,583
- Jae Seok, - Gosh.

1270
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,683
- Are you looking down on us? - It was fine.

1271
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:19,783
- He's weird today. - Just trust us.

1272
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:21,413
He talked about the next runner.

1273
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:22,483
That's not related.

1274
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:24,143
- I think... - There's no point in winning now.

1275
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:25,343
- It's... - Now,

1276
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:27,443
let's root for Gyeong Ree.

1277
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:29,813
- Isn't there no point? - If you do that, you'll lose.

1278
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:31,983
What's the point in doing it?

1279
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:33,583
I won't do it. Don't do as he says.

1280
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,413
- Why do we have to... - Don't do it.

1281
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:38,743
- I won't root for our team. - That's meaningless.

1282
00:46:38,743 --> 00:46:40,243
- We've done it a lot. - This is crazy.

1283
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:41,883
- Gosh, I want to suspect him. - I will do it when camera is off.

1284
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:45,083
- I really want to suspect him. - They don't suspect anything.

1285
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,113
We're doing just fine without any suspicions.

1286
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:48,443
Why do you not suspect anything?

1287
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:50,013
I really want to. But there's nothing suspicious.

1288
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:51,543
Haha, you have poop on your face.

1289
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:54,713
It's just my hair.

1290
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,413
I even touched it.

1291
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,043
- It's my hair. - He touched it to check.

1292
00:46:58,043 --> 00:47:00,013
- Gosh. - He touched it.

1293
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:01,743
He even touched it.

1294
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:03,483
He touched it.

1295
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:05,613
He really thought it's real.

1296
00:47:05,613 --> 00:47:06,783
(The second round is between Gyeong Ree and Ji Hyo.)

1297
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:10,313
(One who puts a pair of socks on first wins.)

1298
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:12,483
- Get ready. - Do it quickly.

1299
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:15,113
- Go, Gyeong Ree! - Look at her.

1300
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:17,383
Gyeong Ree, you can do it.

1301
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:19,713
You can make it. Gyeong Ree!

1302
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,313
- Goodness. - Gyeong Ree.

1303
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:23,143
- You can do it, Gyeong Ree. - If you lose here, we all lose!

1304
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,083
Gyeong Ree, pull it harder.

1305
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,813
- She's too strong. - Good.

1306
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,513
- She is strong. - You're doing good.

1307
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,213
- Go. - Gyeong Ree, that's good.

1308
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:33,783
- That's it. You're doing well. - Cheer for your team.

1309
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:36,043
- You can do it! - That's great.

1310
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:38,483
- Gyeong Ree. - Ji Hyo.

1311
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,113
- Gyeong Ree. - Ji Hyo.

1312
00:47:40,113 --> 00:47:41,943
No, no way!

1313
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:44,413
(Gyeong Ree obtains a pair of socks.)

1314
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:45,443
You can do it!

1315
00:47:45,443 --> 00:47:47,283
- Gyeong Ree. - Just put it on.

1316
00:47:47,283 --> 00:47:49,483
- Go! - Just wear the socks.

1317
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:51,383
- Gyeong Ree. - Put it on!

1318
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,983
- Put the socks on! - Gyeong Ree.

1319
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,843
Put them on!

1320
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:58,343
- Gyeong Ree. - Good!

1321
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,843
- Gyeong Ree. - Gosh.

1322
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:03,383
- Put them on. - That's it.

1323
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:05,343
- Put them on. - Goodness.

1324
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,613
- Put it on now. - Do it quickly.

1325
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:09,283
- Gyeong Ree! - Put them on!

1326
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:11,513
- Do it now! - Gosh!

1327
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,843
- Do it quickly. - Make it quick.

1328
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:15,013
Gyeong Ree!

1329
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:16,783
(Speedy Ji Hyo clears the mission.)

1330
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:17,983
(Red Team earns a score.)

1331
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,813
Our team is doing so great.

1332
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:22,243
- Gosh! - We lost.

1333
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:23,983
I love it when Ji Hyo's on my team.

1334
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:25,983
- She's so strong. - I love it.

1335
00:48:26,343 --> 00:48:28,943
Did you see Gyeong Ree rolling just back then?

1336
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:37,213
(Thanks to the powerful Ji Hyo, Gyeong Ree rolled on the mat.)

1337
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:43,213
- I thought it was a tornado. - I thought she's shooting a film.

1338
00:48:43,683 --> 00:48:45,213
Let's have one more round.

1339
00:48:45,413 --> 00:48:46,943
I recommend Nichkhun and Seok Jin.

1340
00:48:46,943 --> 00:48:49,213
- It won't overturn the score. - That's right.

1341
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:50,683
- You brat. - Flip Seok Jin over.

1342
00:48:50,683 --> 00:48:52,643
How about we bet three points?

1343
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:54,413
- That's good. - Okay.

1344
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:55,683
- We might win. - Right.

1345
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,583
Seok Jin, they're like meerkats.

1346
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,513
Seok Jin, you'll never determine...

1347
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:01,683
- your team's fate like now. - That's right.

1348
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:05,483
Actually, the viewers criticised me when I did "Dig and Crawl".

1349
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:06,783
- I'm sure. - How do you know that?

1350
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,483
- Did you read the comments? - That's nonsense.

1351
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:10,543
- Is it live? - Yes, I received 300 comments.

1352
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:14,543
- Come here. - Seok Jin, that part wasn't aired.

1353
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:15,983
- Really? - Yes.

1354
00:49:15,983 --> 00:49:18,083
- It wasn't aired? - No, it was edited out.

1355
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,513
- It was edited out. - I see.

1356
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:20,943
- Gosh. - What's wrong with you?

1357
00:49:20,943 --> 00:49:22,113
I'm sure it wasn't aired.

1358
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:24,013
- It was aired. - If you give up here...

1359
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:25,443
It doesn't matter if it was aired or not.

1360
00:49:25,443 --> 00:49:27,613
- I'm sure the viewers blamed me. - This is crazy.

1361
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:30,183
- You didn't do your best. - Don't you guys suspect anything?

1362
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:32,713
- No. It's so peaceful. - Get ready!

1363
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:34,113
(This time, I'll do my best.)

1364
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:37,813
(Nichkhun must win in order to move on to the third round.)

1365
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:41,543
(This round will determine each team's fate.)

1366
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:43,643
- We'll get three points if we win. - You can do it.

1367
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:44,713
Go for it!

1368
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,183
- Seok Jin. - He might win.

1369
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,213
(Surprisingly, Seok Jin is doing well.)

1370
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:51,383
- That's a good strategy. - Seok Jin!

1371
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:53,883
(But it goes as everyone expected.)

1372
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:54,983
Gosh.

1373
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,843
I got a cramp.

1374
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:00,143
(Are cramps contagious?)

1375
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:03,383
Hey, pass me the towel.

1376
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:04,883
- Seok Jin! - What?

1377
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:06,583
The viewers are getting angry now.

1378
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,783
Just lie down on the mat.

1379
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:10,843
(I'll improve my image today.)

1380
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:12,043
Pull it harder.

1381
00:50:14,813 --> 00:50:16,483
Wow, that was a good move.

1382
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:18,813
- He might win this time. - Good. Good.

1383
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:24,143
(Seok Jin counterattacks.)

1384
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,113
(I won't let you win.)

1385
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:28,113
(A bit more!)

1386
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:30,843
My goodness.

1387
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:34,243
(He falls forward.)

1388
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:35,483
This isn't a tug of war.

1389
00:50:35,613 --> 00:50:38,243
It looks like you're trying to put the socks on him.

1390
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,683
Go put the socks on.

1391
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:43,513
(He flops on the mat again.)

1392
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:45,213
(He bumps his forehead.)

1393
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:48,283
- I can't watch this any more. - Gosh.

1394
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,113
Why does the mat always roll up...

1395
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,713
- on our side? - Wear the sock.

1396
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:53,483
- What's wrong with the mat? - Wear it.

1397
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:54,643
You can do it.

1398
00:50:54,643 --> 00:50:56,243
(Do you think it's over?)

1399
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:57,643
Fight it.

1400
00:50:57,713 --> 00:50:58,943
- Go for it! - Good.

1401
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,313
- You're almost there! - He's lying still.

1402
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:03,443
- That's good. - You're almost there.

1403
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,113
(Seok Jin boosts his power.)

1404
00:51:05,113 --> 00:51:06,913
(He obtains a pair of socks.)

1405
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:07,943
He can win this time.

1406
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,013
That's nonsense.

1407
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:10,983
- Seok Jin, put them on! - I don't agree with you!

1408
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:12,443
- No way! - Gosh.

1409
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:13,913
- That's it. - No way!

1410
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:17,383
(I can't lose like this.)

1411
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,213
He even struggles to lift his leg.

1412
00:51:19,683 --> 00:51:21,183
He's so stiff.

1413
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:22,383
Why is his feet so large?

1414
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:25,243
He can't fold his knees. He can't.

1415
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,943
(It's not over until it's over!)

1416
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:30,583
(The round is over.)

1417
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,913
Red Team wins this round.

1418
00:51:32,913 --> 00:51:34,883
- Wow. - It's good.

1419
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:36,613
(They have a tie.)

1420
00:51:36,613 --> 00:51:37,613
The game itself was so difficult.

1421
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,943
- It was hard. - Gosh.

1422
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:43,213
Before we go to the last round, team leaders, please come up.

1423
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,383
- Please stop. - Why?

1424
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:47,483
- Why does he want us to come out? - Why?

1425
00:51:47,913 --> 00:51:49,683
- It'll be a moment. - Did you clear the mission?

1426
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:50,943
Come here.

1427
00:51:50,943 --> 00:51:52,683
- Okay. - Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1428
00:51:52,683 --> 00:51:54,383
- This is crazy. - Please come here.

1429
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:56,813
- This is so stressful. - I really want to know.

1430
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:58,383
What is it?

1431
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:00,943
What will be the last mission?

1432
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:03,143
This is the first time they've given a mission so overtly.

1433
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:04,913
- I'm offended. - Just be quiet.

1434
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,913
How can they give you the mission like that?

1435
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:08,183
- Gosh. - We're not fools.

1436
00:52:08,183 --> 00:52:10,483
We are already done for, so just keep quiet!

1437
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:11,683
What is it?

1438
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:14,283
What do you mean? It's a tie.

1439
00:52:15,043 --> 00:52:16,443
(Jae Seok is angry.)

1440
00:52:16,443 --> 00:52:18,383
Should I just tell them everything and finish this?

1441
00:52:18,383 --> 00:52:19,543
Should I just...

1442
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:20,943
Fine. Put an end to this!

1443
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:22,843
- Calm down. - Tell us and end it here!

1444
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:24,913
I don't think it's a one on one match.

1445
00:52:24,913 --> 00:52:27,443
- What they do is more important. - Right?

1446
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:31,113
- You guys are so loud. - That is...

1447
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:33,243
Never tell them about your mission.

1448
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:35,143
- What do you mean? - Come tell us.

1449
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:37,783
- Tell us. - Tell us. We can cooperate.

1450
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,213
- Tell us everything and finish it. - Please tell us.

1451
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:40,683
- Tell me secretly. - What is it?

1452
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:42,283
- Just tell me. - Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1453
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:43,713
- Come on. - My goodness.

1454
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:44,843
What's most important...

1455
00:52:44,943 --> 00:52:47,283
- is that we must do our best. - Jae Seok...

1456
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:50,213
Why is Jae Seok frustrated, but Jong Kook happy?

1457
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:51,413
We must win the games.

1458
00:52:51,413 --> 00:52:53,183
- Gosh. - But Jae Seok,

1459
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:55,043
we didn't mess up yet. It's a tie.

1460
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:57,913
- That's right. - It has just begun.

1461
00:52:57,913 --> 00:53:00,313
- We can win here. - We didn't mess up yet.

1462
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,783
- We must do our best. - It's a tie. We can win this round.

1463
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:03,983
Isn't the water sweet?

1464
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:06,683
(What is their third suspicious mission?)

1465
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:12,683
(Blue Team: 20, Red Team: 40)

1466
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:14,343
We must win the last round.

1467
00:53:14,343 --> 00:53:15,843
The last one is the most important.

1468
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:18,543
- Kwang Soo, the last round... - Jae Seok.

1469
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:19,783
(Kwang Soo is more suspicious than ever.)

1470
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,243
I'm not going to say any more.

1471
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:24,743
I'm so distracted now.

1472
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,283
The most important part is that we need to win this.

1473
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,783
- Okay? - I'm not sure if I should win...

1474
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:32,983
- I mean... - or just suspect you.

1475
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:35,083
Or do I need to remove your name tag?

1476
00:53:35,113 --> 00:53:37,443
Kwang Soo, you can trust me.

1477
00:53:37,443 --> 00:53:39,443
- Kwang Soo... - It's so confusing.

1478
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:43,183
Why are there many tubes? Do we need to hang them?

1479
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:46,483
This is really difficult.

1480
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,713
(There are four poles on each corner and tubes are scattered.)

1481
00:53:48,713 --> 00:53:50,283
- We should hang the tubes. - What?

1482
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:52,943
We've done this before.

1483
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:54,943
When we went to Gangwon-do...

1484
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:56,143
(It was for episode 146.)

1485
00:53:56,143 --> 00:53:58,413
- We did this with Uhm Jung Hwa. - Oh, I got it.

1486
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:00,713
- No, we didn't. - Gosh, it's really hard.

1487
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:02,543
- Really? - Goodness.

1488
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:03,913
(The last mission will be fierce.)

1489
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:06,413
Gosh, it's really hard.

1490
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,113
- Oh, is this that game? - There's a DJ.

1491
00:54:08,113 --> 00:54:09,983
They even invited a DJ.

1492
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:12,913
- Hello. - Hello.

1493
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:14,843
Please put your hands up.

1494
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:16,183
- Good. - Put your hands up.

1495
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:18,143
This game is unfavourable for us.

1496
00:54:18,143 --> 00:54:19,583
- No. - That's not true.

1497
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,583
What do you mean? Of course, we are.

1498
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,313
- Jae Seok, move to the side. - Why do I have to?

1499
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:24,913
Move. That's not the centre.

1500
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:26,413
- This is the centre. - No, it's not.

1501
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:29,643
- This is the centre. - The producer is over there.

1502
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:32,543
(What's wrong with them?)

1503
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:34,843
- Is this a mission? - No.

1504
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,183
Gyeong Ree, come here.

1505
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:38,143
Their mission is to stand in the centre.

1506
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,683
- Goodness. - Let's begin.

1507
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:44,783
- Gosh, it's not. - Come back here.

1508
00:54:44,783 --> 00:54:47,413
It's not your turn. Just stay there.

1509
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:48,843
I already feel exhausted.

1510
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:51,313
- Is this their mission? - Do they need to be in the centre?

1511
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:53,443
(What's their suspicious mission?)

1512
00:54:53,913 --> 00:54:56,213
- Just stay put. - Please look at the screen.

1513
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,613
It's David Hasselhoff again.

1514
00:54:57,743 --> 00:55:00,243
I'm sure you're having a long and tough day.

1515
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:01,843
That is so true.

1516
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:05,243
In this round, I'd like to see how sharp your judgment is.

1517
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:08,083
This round is called "Hang the Tubes".

1518
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:09,343
- What? - What did he say?

1519
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:10,483
What did he say?

1520
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:11,843
(They have to hang the tubes as they expected.)

1521
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:14,983
When the music is on, you must dance.

1522
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:18,043
And you can't touch the tubes while you're dancing.

1523
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:22,413
When the music stops, whichever team hangs...

1524
00:55:22,613 --> 00:55:27,243
the most tubes on their team's pole wins.

1525
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,813
But first, let's check out your dance skills.

1526
00:55:30,883 --> 00:55:33,243
Let's have a party!

1527
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:34,343
(They do a dance competition first.)

1528
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:36,913
The first one to dance is Ki Woo!

1529
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:41,443
(Ki Woo is the perfect example of a tall person.)

1530
00:55:41,443 --> 00:55:42,943
Let's go, Ki Woo!

1531
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:46,343
(Show us!)

1532
00:55:47,513 --> 00:55:48,513
What?

1533
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:49,713
What's that?

1534
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,943
(He looks like he's rubbing something.)

1535
00:55:50,943 --> 00:55:51,943
Wait.

1536
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:53,183
(He passionately does the rubbing dance.)

1537
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:55,483
(And next,)

1538
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,943
(he flounders in the air.)

1539
00:56:00,883 --> 00:56:01,983
(And he falls.)

1540
00:56:03,813 --> 00:56:07,013
(He rotates 180 degrees and falls on the ground.)

1541
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:08,383
- Are you okay? - It's fun.

1542
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:10,083
- It's fun. - Didn't you fall hard?

1543
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:11,513
He has a good sense of...

1544
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:13,243
Didn't you fall hard?

1545
00:56:13,243 --> 00:56:14,683
- He has good motor nerves. - It's a technique.

1546
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:18,343
(Ki Woo tries it again.)

1547
00:56:18,343 --> 00:56:19,943
What's wrong with him?

1548
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,043
- Try harder, Ki Woo. - What's wrong with him?

1549
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:23,413
You're excited, right?

1550
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,643
- This is... - Isn't that really old?

1551
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:26,843
(He falls to the ground.)

1552
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:29,943
(He does an anaemia dance.)

1553
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:31,543
Great.

1554
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:33,713
Next is Gyeong Ree.

1555
00:56:33,713 --> 00:56:35,113
(Gyeong Ree goes next.)

1556
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,383
(She shows off her sexiness.)

1557
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:39,443
Oh dear.

1558
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,813
(She shows off her sexiness.)

1559
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:44,383
Oh dear. Let's go!

1560
00:56:45,043 --> 00:56:47,583
(I'm so thankful that I get to watch this.)

1561
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:49,813
Yes! Let's go!

1562
00:56:49,883 --> 00:56:51,213
We're winning!

1563
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,843
We are totally winning the dance competition.

1564
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,683
Let's go, Gyeong Ree!

1565
00:56:55,313 --> 00:56:56,343
What's that?

1566
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:59,883
(I am Gyeong Ree from Nine Muses.)

1567
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,613
Next is Nichkhun!

1568
00:57:01,613 --> 00:57:02,783
- Here we go! - Nichkhun!

1569
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:04,643
(Nichkhun is the handsome prince.)

1570
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:09,343
(He shows the old school dance.)

1571
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,483
Go, Nichkhun!

1572
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:13,313
(He looks good whatever he does.)

1573
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:14,613
Nichkhun is good.

1574
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:15,783
Here we go.

1575
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,783
(Jae Seok and Haha dance next.)

1576
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:23,483
(They heat up the atmosphere.)

1577
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:27,213
(Kwang Soo the Dance Machine dances next.)

1578
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,783
(His passion for dance never ceases.)

1579
00:57:31,783 --> 00:57:33,483
- You're sexy. - You're sexy.

1580
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:36,843
- Ji Hyo. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

1581
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:38,113
(Ji Hyo from Red Team comes in.)

1582
00:57:39,883 --> 00:57:41,683
She's good. It's a battle.

1583
00:57:41,913 --> 00:57:43,013
Gyeong Ree.

1584
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:44,143
- It's a battle. - Here she comes.

1585
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:45,283
(I heard you dance well.)

1586
00:57:45,283 --> 00:57:47,383
(Watch it for yourself!)

1587
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:49,813
Come on!

1588
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,683
(Kwang Soo annoys Ji Hyo.)

1589
00:57:51,683 --> 00:57:52,813
(And Ji Hyo slaps him.)

1590
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,213
(Would you please move?)

1591
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,413
(He gets beaten up while dancing.)

1592
00:57:56,413 --> 00:57:58,283
- How can she do this? - Good job.

1593
00:57:58,283 --> 00:57:59,643
- Good job. - Was that part of the dance?

1594
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,743
- Good job. - Okay!

1595
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,443
(Next is the couple dance competition.)

1596
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:05,483
That's nice.

1597
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:07,343
(It's a couple gorilla dance.)

1598
00:58:09,383 --> 00:58:10,743
That's good.

1599
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:13,213
I don't want to lose. I don't want to lose.

1600
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:15,483
(The two teams' prides are on stake.)

1601
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,083
(The warm-up dance finishes with the couple dance battle.)

1602
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,183
All right, everyone.

1603
00:58:20,183 --> 00:58:22,283
This is the mission given by the captain.

1604
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:24,043
When the music plays, you have to dance.

1605
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,213
- Okay. - Okay.

1606
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:30,043
The team that has the most tubes on the poles wins.

1607
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:32,343
When I blow the whistle, the competition ends.

1608
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:33,943
- Okay. - We can't take them out, right?

1609
00:58:34,183 --> 00:58:36,183
Try every possible means to win.

1610
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,343
(Anything goes.)

1611
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:44,013
- He's really fast. - That's it! That's it!

1612
00:58:44,013 --> 00:58:51,083
(Will Blue Team win with a miraculous one win?)

1613
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:53,913
Come on!

1614
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:57,513
(Or will Red Team that got two wins...)

1615
00:58:57,513 --> 00:59:00,543
(with persistence and power win?)

1616
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,743
He's really different.

1617
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:04,183
He's really good.

1618
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:09,283
(The current score is 1 to 1.)

1619
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:13,583
(Which team will win in the end?)

1620
00:59:15,443 --> 00:59:17,583
(DJ, drop the beat!)

1621
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,783
(The final mission starts.)

1622
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,513
(They keep sticking together.)

1623
00:59:23,613 --> 00:59:26,983
(They dance and keep each other in check at the same time.)

1624
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,043
(Everyone dances around the tubes.)

1625
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:33,543
(They look for a chance every minute.)

1626
00:59:35,413 --> 00:59:36,913
(The whistle blows.)

1627
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:39,913
(They start putting the tubes.)

1628
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:45,483
(The team that has more tubes on their poles wins.)

1629
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:46,643
No, no!

1630
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:47,883
(The team that has more tubes on their poles wins.)

1631
00:59:51,743 --> 00:59:52,813
(Everyone is busy inserting tubes into their poles.)

1632
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,043
Take this!

1633
00:59:54,043 --> 00:59:57,183
(Everyone is busy inserting tubes into their poles.)

1634
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:58,313
Do that later.

1635
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:03,443
(Then, Kwang Soo approaches the other team's pole.)

1636
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:04,513
- I'm here. - Jong Kook.

1637
01:00:04,913 --> 01:00:07,243
Look at Kwang Soo.

1638
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:11,613
(Kwang Soo is determined to take the other team's tubes.)

1639
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:12,643
No. No.

1640
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,143
(But Ji Hyo guards the pole.)

1641
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:17,643
(Red Team is winning.)

1642
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:19,583
(Jae Seok can't let it happen.)

1643
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:22,643
Take them out.

1644
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:25,183
(They take all the tubes out.)

1645
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:26,243
(Blue Team successfully ambushes them.)

1646
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:27,283
Let's go.

1647
01:00:27,313 --> 01:00:28,383
What are you doing?

1648
01:00:28,683 --> 01:00:31,013
(We can't lose.)

1649
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:32,413
(All the tubes are taken out.)

1650
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:33,483
Hey!

1651
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:34,883
That's it!

1652
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:35,983
Hey!

1653
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:37,813
(You have to say something nice to hear something nice back.)

1654
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:40,343
Good job, Ki Woo. Ki Woo is good.

1655
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,243
(Ki Woo goes from a weak one to an ace!)

1656
01:00:43,243 --> 01:00:44,243
No!

1657
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:50,083
(Kwang Soo chooses a target.)

1658
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:52,443
- Hey, you! - What's going on?

1659
01:00:56,683 --> 01:00:59,843
(But Nichkhun's defence was fast.)

1660
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:04,983
(Kwang Soo gets blocked by Nichkhun.)

1661
01:01:05,043 --> 01:01:07,583
We have to stop them!

1662
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,043
We have to stop them!

1663
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:10,843
- Take Ji Hyo out! - We need to steal them!

1664
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:12,383
- Take Ji Hyo out! - Gyeong Ree!

1665
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:16,283
(Haha runs and takes out all the tubes.)

1666
01:01:17,283 --> 01:01:18,283
(Haha attacks surprisingly.)

1667
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:19,313
No way!

1668
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:20,383
(Haha does a surprise attacks.)

1669
01:01:21,213 --> 01:01:22,313
Gosh.

1670
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,283
- What was that? - Look at Haha!

1671
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:26,313
- I'm not doing anything. - Look at that.

1672
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:28,083
I'm not doing anything.

1673
01:01:28,783 --> 01:01:31,483
(The DJ drops the beat again.)

1674
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:32,783
- Dance! - Dance!

1675
01:01:32,783 --> 01:01:33,843
Dance!

1676
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:35,883
Dance!

1677
01:01:37,183 --> 01:01:38,643
Come on.

1678
01:01:39,643 --> 01:01:41,043
- Come on. - What's this?

1679
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:42,243
What are we doing?

1680
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:43,713
- What are we doing? - It looks strange.

1681
01:01:43,713 --> 01:01:45,783
- Is this a club? - It looks strange.

1682
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:47,313
It looks strange.

1683
01:01:47,783 --> 01:01:49,713
Hey, move.

1684
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:51,683
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin dance dirty.)

1685
01:01:51,683 --> 01:01:54,683
(And Kwang Soo joins.)

1686
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:59,443
(Let's dance.)

1687
01:01:59,443 --> 01:02:00,513
This is not dancing!

1688
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:05,013
(Haha gets bounced on the floor.)

1689
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:08,483
(This is the real bounce.)

1690
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,743
(We will revitalise you, Sir.)

1691
01:02:09,743 --> 01:02:11,043
- Here we go! - Let's dance!

1692
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:15,613
(Jong Kook heads towards Haha's pole as well.)

1693
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,243
(It's so crowded around Red Team's pole.)

1694
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:20,883
Come on, everyone.

1695
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:21,913
Guard that area, Gyeong Ree!

1696
01:02:23,683 --> 01:02:24,783
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

1697
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:27,483
(Jae Seok runs fast.)

1698
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:28,783
Kwang Soo.

1699
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:31,013
(His target is Ji Hyo.)

1700
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:35,613
(She's about to get in trouble.)

1701
01:02:39,513 --> 01:02:42,143
(She's goes into a defensive mode.)

1702
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,513
Hey.

1703
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:48,043
(I am Ji Hyo.)

1704
01:02:48,383 --> 01:02:49,483
Hey. Hey.

1705
01:02:49,483 --> 01:02:51,543
Come on down, Ji Hyo. Hurry up.

1706
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:52,813
Come down!

1707
01:02:53,413 --> 01:02:54,713
- What's wrong with her? - What's up with this girl?

1708
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:57,013
- What's wrong with her? - What's wrong with her?

1709
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:59,013
She's...

1710
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:00,243
- She's... - She's unbelievable.

1711
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,513
What's wrong with her these days?

1712
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:02,913
(It's empty on this side.)

1713
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:05,243
(Some try to take out the tubes while others try to stop them.)

1714
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,683
(Seok Jin tries to take out the tubes.)

1715
01:03:09,013 --> 01:03:10,443
(This game will determine the two teams' fates.)

1716
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:11,483
- Move Ji Hyo. - Take him away!

1717
01:03:11,843 --> 01:03:12,943
Do it!

1718
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:14,983
Let go of your hands!

1719
01:03:15,843 --> 01:03:17,713
Hold on.

1720
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:18,813
(I can't let the tubes go.)

1721
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:21,183
(He raises his leg.)

1722
01:03:21,783 --> 01:03:24,143
(He defends the tubes by twisting his legs around them.)

1723
01:03:24,413 --> 01:03:26,243
Jae Seok, you have to take them out.

1724
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,183
(Screaming)

1725
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:30,713
He bit me.

1726
01:03:31,213 --> 01:03:33,183
(Jae Seok bites Ki Woo.)

1727
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:35,383
Wait.

1728
01:03:35,383 --> 01:03:36,743
He's weird. He bites people.

1729
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:38,343
Kwang Soo is coming.

1730
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:40,613
(Among all the chaos, Red Team gathers more tubes.)

1731
01:03:40,613 --> 01:03:41,613
That's enough.

1732
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:43,713
We have too many tubes.

1733
01:03:44,313 --> 01:03:47,443
(Both teams have two poles each.)

1734
01:03:47,443 --> 01:03:51,743
(Red Team has 25 tubes, and Blue Team has 14 tubes.)

1735
01:03:51,743 --> 01:03:54,213
Please stop.

1736
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:57,543
- Team leaders, come on up. - Why again?

1737
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,113
(Why are you calling again?)

1738
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:01,243
We are in the middle of the game!

1739
01:04:01,243 --> 01:04:03,643
People will have doubts if you do this in the middle of the game!

1740
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:05,913
The captain sent us a message.

1741
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:07,383
- We... - Wait.

1742
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,983
Please stop for a while.

1743
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:10,613
(They are all very suspicious.)

1744
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,383
I told you about another mission.

1745
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,813
Here's your mission.

1746
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:17,743
You are playing "Hang the Tubes".

1747
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:23,983
You have to make sure that your pole doesn't have any donut tubes.

1748
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:25,213
Do you understand?

1749
01:04:25,213 --> 01:04:29,443
(They have to remove the donut tubes without the team knowing.)

1750
01:04:30,643 --> 01:04:33,343
(This is the donut tube.)

1751
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:36,213
- What is it? - We will resume the game.

1752
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,643
What is it?

1753
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:39,683
(They are very suspicious.)

1754
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,583
- Gary. - I am so curious.

1755
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,913
- All right. - What is it?

1756
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,443
- What is it? - It's...

1757
01:04:45,443 --> 01:04:46,513
Isn't he...

1758
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:48,583
- What is it? - being too obvious?

1759
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,083
- I just had... - Isn't it too obvious?

1760
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,343
- I had something to tell my team. - Don't cheat.

1761
01:04:52,343 --> 01:04:53,783
What is it? Tell us. It's okay.

1762
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:55,443
- I think it's about you. - This is frustrating.

1763
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:58,813
I'm going to develop a stomach disease.

1764
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:00,243
(He can't tell anyone about it.)

1765
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:01,813
(It's more like a Sad Mission than a Suspicious Mission.)

1766
01:05:01,813 --> 01:05:02,883
It's okay.

1767
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:04,843
Should we guard the tubes?

1768
01:05:05,283 --> 01:05:08,443
(Blue Team has 4 donut tubes, and Red Team has none.)

1769
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:10,983
(The donut tube is the cause of his stomach disease.)

1770
01:05:12,513 --> 01:05:14,683
(The music starts.)

1771
01:05:14,683 --> 01:05:17,283
(They warm up before the game resumes.)

1772
01:05:18,183 --> 01:05:20,343
(Why are they coming towards me?)

1773
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,013
(Jae Seok slyly takes the donut tube.)

1774
01:05:23,943 --> 01:05:25,013
Wait.

1775
01:05:25,013 --> 01:05:27,243
Why are you moving?

1776
01:05:27,243 --> 01:05:29,083
(What's wrong with them?)

1777
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:31,243
(Gyeong Ree is happy that her song is on.)

1778
01:05:33,883 --> 01:05:35,683
- Bring it here. - Hey!

1779
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:37,143
(Kicking)

1780
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,913
What was that about?

1781
01:05:38,913 --> 01:05:40,143
(They're confused.)

1782
01:05:40,143 --> 01:05:41,443
That must be the mission.

1783
01:05:42,543 --> 01:05:44,343
- Come down, Ji Hyo. - Come down.

1784
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:47,143
Come down first. Listen to me. Come down, Ji Hyo.

1785
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,743
- You have to steal it! - Come down, Ji Hyo.

1786
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:51,543
- Hold this. - Steal it!

1787
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:53,083
- Hey! - You can't.

1788
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:54,883
Hey.

1789
01:05:56,013 --> 01:05:58,183
- Come down, Ji Hyo. Trust me. - Jong Kook!

1790
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,943
- Take them out. - Why are you doing this?

1791
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:01,983
- Look at them. - Hurry.

1792
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:03,543
Why?

1793
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:07,743
- Take them out. - Why are you doing this?

1794
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:09,443
- What's this? - Take this...

1795
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,043
and hang it on the other team's pole.

1796
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:13,083
(Haha catches on.)

1797
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:14,513
- What? - I think that's what you do.

1798
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:16,783
- What? - Take it out. Hurry!

1799
01:06:16,983 --> 01:06:18,013
Take it out!

1800
01:06:18,943 --> 01:06:20,043
(The doughnut tube is on the Blue Team's pole.)

1801
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:21,113
What's this about?

1802
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:22,943
What is he doing?

1803
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:25,713
(Kwang Soo is quick to act.)

1804
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:27,583
What's this about?

1805
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,043
Why are you taking it out?

1806
01:06:29,483 --> 01:06:31,243
- You have to stop him. - It's the doughnut!

1807
01:06:31,243 --> 01:06:32,443
(He donates it to the opposing team.)

1808
01:06:34,343 --> 01:06:35,943
(How dare you disturb Ji Hyo's fortress?)

1809
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:37,343
(Biting)

1810
01:06:39,313 --> 01:06:40,613
Just let go.

1811
01:06:41,283 --> 01:06:43,283
(Ji Hyo's teeth are strong.)

1812
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:44,483
- Hold on! - I took it out.

1813
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:46,743
What's going on?

1814
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:49,113
(You need to put the doughnut tube on the opposing team's pole.)

1815
01:06:49,113 --> 01:06:51,443
- Why are you taking it out? - I don't know. He's losing it.

1816
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:53,843
- What are you doing? - What is it?

1817
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:55,283
- What do we do? - Where are my glasses?

1818
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,783
What is it, Jae Seok?

1819
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,143
Take the doughnut tube out!

1820
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:00,243
Must I put it or take it out?

1821
01:07:00,343 --> 01:07:01,783
(Must I put it or take it out?)

1822
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:03,513
What should I do?

1823
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:05,643
I have no idea what's going on.

1824
01:07:07,113 --> 01:07:08,743
(Red Team has 14 tubes and no doughnut tube.)

1825
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:10,313
(Blue Team has 14 tubes and 2 doughnut tubes.)

1826
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,583
(Pass me...)

1827
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:13,743
Give it me.

1828
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:14,843
(the doughnut tube.)

1829
01:07:14,843 --> 01:07:16,483
(No way!)

1830
01:07:16,943 --> 01:07:19,143
Take the doughnut, Nichkhun!

1831
01:07:19,143 --> 01:07:20,413
(Run towards the doughnut tube!)

1832
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:22,243
Block them!

1833
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,683
(Falling)

1834
01:07:32,813 --> 01:07:34,843
(Blocking)

1835
01:07:35,783 --> 01:07:37,013
- What is it? - Wait.

1836
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:38,243
Take the doughnut!

1837
01:07:38,243 --> 01:07:39,843
(What's with the doughnut tube?)

1838
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:42,883
(Seok Jin grabs Haha's dreadlocks.)

1839
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:46,513
(Give us the tube if you want to keep your dreadlocks.)

1840
01:07:49,743 --> 01:07:50,983
- Put it over. - Move over.

1841
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,443
(They try to avoid the doughnut tube.)

1842
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,213
What's going on, anyway?

1843
01:08:01,283 --> 01:08:02,943
I have no idea what's going on.

1844
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,243
Why are you all going for the doughnut tube?

1845
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:07,713
Should we take our tubes out and hang it on theirs?

1846
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:09,443
What's more important?

1847
01:08:09,983 --> 01:08:11,343
Hurry and put it over.

1848
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:12,843
Where are we supposed to go?

1849
01:08:14,043 --> 01:08:15,083
Five,

1850
01:08:15,713 --> 01:08:17,253
- four, - You can't rip it!

1851
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,413
- three, - You can't rip it.

1852
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:21,013
- two, - Kwang Soo!

1853
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:22,753
- one. - Put a tube in.

1854
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:25,943
(Game over)

1855
01:08:26,283 --> 01:08:27,343
It's good.

1856
01:08:27,843 --> 01:08:30,013
What was this game about?

1857
01:08:30,143 --> 01:08:31,753
Tell us already!

1858
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:33,783
I already told you it was "Hang the Tubes".

1859
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:37,183
The team that hangs the most tubes wins.

1860
01:08:37,253 --> 01:08:39,213
- We could have won. - What?

1861
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:40,643
No, we're close.

1862
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:42,913
- It's a close game. - It is.

1863
01:08:43,313 --> 01:08:46,083
(Their fates are decided by this round.)

1864
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:49,343
(The winners are crowned and the losers are flogged.)

1865
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:51,183
(Who is the ultimate winner?)

1866
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:52,783
Take one out at a time.

1867
01:08:53,413 --> 01:08:54,753
- One, - One,

1868
01:08:55,543 --> 01:08:56,683
- two, - two,

1869
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:58,483
- three... - three...

1870
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:01,083
- Seven, - Seven,

1871
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:04,583
- Seven, - They have one more.

1872
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:05,583
(It's a tie.)

1873
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:06,683
- Eight! - Eight.

1874
01:09:07,283 --> 01:09:08,843
- They have many small tube. - Right.

1875
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:10,843
(They start counting the tubes on the second pole.)

1876
01:09:10,843 --> 01:09:12,143
We're only 1 behind. They have 8.

1877
01:09:13,413 --> 01:09:14,483
(Red Team: 8, Blue Team: 7)

1878
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,543
That's nine.

1879
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:17,013
(Red Team: 8, Blue Team: 7)

1880
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:18,043
Nine,

1881
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:19,753
That's 10.

1882
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,943
- We have a lot of fat ones. - We do.

1883
01:09:23,753 --> 01:09:24,913
- 14, - 14,

1884
01:09:25,483 --> 01:09:26,943
- 15, - That's 15.

1885
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:28,943
- 16, - We have a lot.

1886
01:09:28,943 --> 01:09:30,343
- There are more inside. - 17!

1887
01:09:30,343 --> 01:09:31,643
- We have more inside. - Hold on.

1888
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:33,883
- That's 18. - 18.

1889
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:35,443
- That's 18. - Wow!

1890
01:09:35,483 --> 01:09:37,313
(It's 18 to 18.)

1891
01:09:37,313 --> 01:09:38,413
- 19! - 19!

1892
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:40,213
- We have more. - They have more.

1893
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:42,443
- 20. - 20.

1894
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:43,813
(It's 20 to 20.)

1895
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:46,383
(This round is unpredictable.)

1896
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:49,543
(Which team is the ultimate winner?)

1897
01:09:50,783 --> 01:09:52,683
- 21. - We have more, too.

1898
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:53,843
- 21, - We won.

1899
01:09:53,843 --> 01:09:55,613
- 22, - Okay!

1900
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,283
- There's more inside. - We have one less.

1901
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:59,183
- 23! - Okay!

1902
01:09:59,183 --> 01:10:00,343
(Red Team wins 23 to 22.)

1903
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,343
Good.

1904
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:02,443
Okay!

1905
01:10:02,443 --> 01:10:04,183
- We should have stolen their tubes. - Good.

1906
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:05,513
That was so close.

1907
01:10:05,713 --> 01:10:08,683
- Did we lose by one? - We should have stopped them.

1908
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:11,543
What was this about? What was it with the doughnut tube?

1909
01:10:11,543 --> 01:10:13,943
I think that's a competition for these two.

1910
01:10:14,013 --> 01:10:15,943
- Are we supposed to hang it? - So everyone,

1911
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:17,613
let me announce the result.

1912
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,813
Tell them. I'm itching to tell them. This is too stressful.

1913
01:10:19,813 --> 01:10:21,643
What is this? What's this about?

1914
01:10:21,643 --> 01:10:23,643
You probably realised that something suspicious was going on.

1915
01:10:23,643 --> 01:10:25,713
- My goodness. - That was so obvious.

1916
01:10:25,713 --> 01:10:28,783
I don't know what to do with my team. Tell them.

1917
01:10:28,783 --> 01:10:32,543
Your team leaders have been receiving suspicious missions.

1918
01:10:32,643 --> 01:10:35,043
- That was hard for us. - It was really hard.

1919
01:10:35,043 --> 01:10:37,213
- It was a huge dilemma. - My team...

1920
01:10:37,213 --> 01:10:39,113
was full of mistrust and misunderstanding.

1921
01:10:39,113 --> 01:10:41,253
My team trusted each other.

1922
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:43,183
Nichkhun and Ki Woo didn't say a word.

1923
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:44,813
They just felt uncomfortable.

1924
01:10:46,213 --> 01:10:49,013
The mission for this last game...

1925
01:10:49,253 --> 01:10:51,643
was to remove the doughnut tube...

1926
01:10:51,643 --> 01:10:54,613
since it won't be counted towards the total.

1927
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,883
Therefore,

1928
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:58,813
- Red Team has 23... - It's 23.

1929
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,083
and Blue Team has 22.

1930
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:03,883
However, Red Team...

1931
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:06,643
- had three doughnut tubes. - That's right.

1932
01:11:06,643 --> 01:11:08,583
- Blue Team had two. - That's right.

1933
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:12,443
In conclusion, the doughnut tubes...

1934
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:15,313
don't count towards the total,

1935
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,783
- They don't? - it's 20 to 20.

1936
01:11:17,783 --> 01:11:18,883
- Is it a draw? - Wow.

1937
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:21,183
That's good to hear.

1938
01:11:21,613 --> 01:11:24,613
As a result, the score ends up being...

1939
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,483
a tie but when you count the doughnut tubes,

1940
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:29,783
- Blue Team wins. - We win, right?

1941
01:11:29,783 --> 01:11:31,613
- We won? - Yes!

1942
01:11:31,613 --> 01:11:33,043
- Is this what it was about? - However,

1943
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,983
do you remember the ice creams you had?

1944
01:11:35,983 --> 01:11:38,083
The mission behind the ice cream...

1945
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:41,513
was that if you take off your wig first, your team loses.

1946
01:11:41,783 --> 01:11:43,513
I wasn't the first to take it off.

1947
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:47,413
(You're the culprit!)

1948
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:49,513
(Let me try to recollect my memory.)

1949
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:51,943
(Let's rewind six hours back.)

1950
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:54,313
(He takes it off.)

1951
01:11:55,013 --> 01:11:58,253
And the mission for the first round...

1952
01:11:58,383 --> 01:12:00,943
was the team that says, "Let's go" first...

1953
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:02,143
We didn't say it.

1954
01:12:03,213 --> 01:12:04,683
- Did I say it? - You have to apologise.

1955
01:12:04,683 --> 01:12:06,043
You said it as soon as we heard the mission.

1956
01:12:06,043 --> 01:12:07,813
Focus on the game. Don't doubt anything.

1957
01:12:07,813 --> 01:12:09,113
- Let's go! - We can do it.

1958
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:11,413
For the second game...

1959
01:12:11,413 --> 01:12:13,583
- called "Wear the Socks", - I'm going nuts.

1960
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:15,943
the team member that drinks water first...

1961
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:17,913
- We didn't drink first, right? - Was it me?

1962
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:18,983
I don't remember drinking it.

1963
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,683
- When did I drink it? - I gave it to you.

1964
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:21,783
- When? - I opened the bottle for you.

1965
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:23,013
- See? - Did you?

1966
01:12:23,013 --> 01:12:24,283
- Our team... - My goodness.

1967
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,343
- Why did you give it to him? - I knew we were going to win...

1968
01:12:29,343 --> 01:12:30,713
because he likes being treated well.

1969
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,543
- Oh, gosh. - He drank it right away.

1970
01:12:32,543 --> 01:12:35,783
There were three games in total,

1971
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:38,643
- but Red Team won two missions... - They won.

1972
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,513
- wins by 10 points. - They won.

1973
01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:41,783
(Red Team wins by 10 points.)

1974
01:12:42,413 --> 01:12:44,383
- Way to go. - We have to thank Seok Jin.

1975
01:12:44,513 --> 01:12:46,443
- You two... - I just drank water.

1976
01:12:46,443 --> 01:12:48,013
- How many points was that? - Was I not supposed to cheer?

1977
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:49,983
Do you know how many points you lost?

1978
01:12:50,113 --> 01:12:52,883
The wig kept on getting in my mouth so I had to take it off.

1979
01:12:52,943 --> 01:12:55,783
So according to the Captain's guidelines,

1980
01:12:55,783 --> 01:12:58,543
Jong Kook will be promoted as the captain.

1981
01:12:58,543 --> 01:12:59,943
(Jong Kook is the captain!)

1982
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:00,983
Go on your knees!

1983
01:13:01,983 --> 01:13:03,583
- Go on your knees. - My gosh.

1984
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:05,843
- You're at the bottom. - This is what I wanted.

1985
01:13:05,883 --> 01:13:07,343
- You're at the bottom. - We're done.

1986
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:08,583
- I'll make you the leader. - Thank you.

1987
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,883
- You can be the leader. - I'm so upset.

1988
01:13:10,883 --> 01:13:12,253
- Thank you. - I'm at your service.

1989
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:14,443
All members of the Red Team...

1990
01:13:15,283 --> 01:13:17,043
get a golden whistle.

1991
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:21,013
- This is amazing. - The leader gets a badge.

1992
01:13:21,013 --> 01:13:23,413
- I didn't even do anything. - This is amazing.

1993
01:13:23,413 --> 01:13:25,253
- This is amazing. - It it real gold?

1994
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:27,113
- It is. - I didn't even do anything.

1995
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:28,813
It's not part of the game,

1996
01:13:28,883 --> 01:13:30,483
- but we decided... - I'm so frustrated.

1997
01:13:30,483 --> 01:13:32,213
that the losing team will get punished.

1998
01:13:32,343 --> 01:13:33,613
Let's start with Jae Seok.

1999
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:35,783
- Excuse me. - He's the team leader...

2000
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:37,783
so he's the most responsible.

2001
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,013
Is it just once?

2002
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:41,643
- Of course. Don't rub it. - It's just once.

2003
01:13:41,753 --> 01:13:44,343
- It's almost done. - It has to stick to his butt.

2004
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:45,383
- Exactly. - My gosh.

2005
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:47,413
Oh, gosh.

2006
01:13:47,543 --> 01:13:49,313
(He wets Jae Seok's bum.)

2007
01:13:50,113 --> 01:13:51,443
Don't do that.

2008
01:13:52,143 --> 01:13:53,543
I can't watch.

2009
01:13:53,543 --> 01:13:55,083
Stop rubbing it.

2010
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:58,483
- Count 1! - In 1, 2, 3!

2011
01:13:58,483 --> 01:13:59,513
(It's better to go first.)

2012
01:13:59,513 --> 01:14:00,643
(My goodness!)

2013
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:02,683
(That's loud.)

2014
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:05,043
Hey, wait.

2015
01:14:06,213 --> 01:14:07,983
- Hold on a second. - I'm sorry!

2016
01:14:08,283 --> 01:14:09,443
I'm sorry.

2017
01:14:09,483 --> 01:14:11,543
I should have worn red.

2018
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:15,083
I'm sorry I'm wearing blue.

2019
01:14:15,143 --> 01:14:16,883
- Ji Hyo. - Give me a red shirt.

2020
01:14:16,883 --> 01:14:19,143
- Can you do it instead, Ji Hyo? - Why?

2021
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:21,883
- Come here. - Ji Hyo!

2022
01:14:21,883 --> 01:14:23,843
- Come here, both of you. - Let her do it.

2023
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:26,113
- Let Ji Hyo do it. - Give it to her.

2024
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,213
Let her do it.

2025
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,753
- I'll do it for Kwang Soo. - Sure.

2026
01:14:28,753 --> 01:14:29,813
Let her flog me.

2027
01:14:30,283 --> 01:14:32,583
You have to flog it harder than you think, Ji Hyo.

2028
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:34,343
- Okay. - You have to hit it hard.

2029
01:14:35,283 --> 01:14:36,643
- Right. - She's strong.

2030
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,143
(She takes a mouthful of water.)

2031
01:14:39,713 --> 01:14:41,083
Did you drink?

2032
01:14:41,683 --> 01:14:42,713
Ji Hyo.

2033
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:44,513
(Trickling)

2034
01:14:45,683 --> 01:14:47,383
This is gross.

2035
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:49,183
- Don't do that, Ji Hyo. - Why are you doing this?

2036
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:52,413
I didn't even bring an extra underwear. What's wrong with you?

2037
01:14:52,413 --> 01:14:53,983
You're quite something.

2038
01:14:53,983 --> 01:14:55,983
- Let's get started. - Yes.

2039
01:14:56,443 --> 01:14:59,713
One, two, three.

2040
01:15:00,443 --> 01:15:01,443
Three.

2041
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:02,613
(Flogging)

2042
01:15:03,713 --> 01:15:05,043
(Hitting)

2043
01:15:06,443 --> 01:15:08,143
(Thank you Ki Woo, Nichkhun and Gyeong Ree...)

2044
01:15:08,143 --> 01:15:10,043
(for joining us and participating in the games.)

2045
01:15:10,043 --> 01:15:12,983
(The following segment is based on the discussion from our meeting.)

2046
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,283
We don't have anything filmed for next week's episode.

2047
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:17,343
Should we reveal the mission in the trailer?

2048
01:15:17,343 --> 01:15:19,983
It'll be a way to check if the members watch the episodes.

2049
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,113
(Sniggering)

2050
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:22,143
(Therefore)

2051
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,543
Running Man members, this is your first mission.

2052
01:15:25,183 --> 01:15:29,483
Once you see this, call the main producer right away.

2053
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:35,213
(The first three to call will have an advantage for the final mission.)
