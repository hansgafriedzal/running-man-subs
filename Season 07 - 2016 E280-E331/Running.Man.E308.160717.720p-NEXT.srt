1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,100
(At a cafe near Hongik University)

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,630
(A cup of warm coffee is waiting...)

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,500
(for today's guest.)

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,700
Hello.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,230
(Who is this mysterious woman?)

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,030
(She still looks so young and beautiful just like before.)

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,600
(Kim Hee Ae)

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,430
- Nice to meet you.
 -  Hello.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,500
It's an honour. Please sit.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,600
(Why are they meeting up in secret?)

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,220
There's a reason why we called you before the filming starts.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,300
- Please, don't get nervous.
 -  I'm nervous already.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,570
This week's special is...

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,460
Invigorating Foods for this hot summer.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,930
You will be doing a race as a team.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,000
But...

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,860
we will assign a special mission just for you.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,900
I'm getting nervous now.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,700
We will assign you as a special agent for today.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,070
You'll be doing a hidden mission alone in secret.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,980
(Special agent? Hidden mission?)

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,430
If you complete the hidden mission as the special agent,

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,530
you will get not only invigorating foods from today's race,

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,900
but you will also get the winning prize.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh. What is the prize?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,340
(She's glad to hear that.)

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,990
The prize is a golden badge...

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,700
which is specially designed for the agent.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,260
(A handmade golden badge just for the special agent)

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
(She wouldn't want to miss it.)

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,860
I see. It must be quite expensive.

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,330
Yes. You can win that badge along with other prizes.

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,600
- I'll tell you what the mission is.
 -  Okay.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,860
The mission is called "Second to Last".

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,160
(The hidden mission is "Second to Last")

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,260
- "Second to Last"?
 -  That's right.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,560
Let me explain.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,860
(The name is similar to her upcoming drama.)

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,140
Let me explain the details.

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,390
Every member will draw a number each.

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,900
There are nine members in total today.

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,330
The 2nd to last number is number 8, right?

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,600
You need to make a person with number 8, the 2nd place.

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,040
You don't want to give me the gold, do you?

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,180
Can't it be easier?

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,630
- I'll continue.
 -  Okay.

48
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,430
There will be one more special agent.

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,160
(Another special agent?)

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,270
There are two special agents including you.

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,480
Who is that?

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,820
(The other special agent will be her supporter. Who will that be?)

53
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,630
There are two special agents including you.

54
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,580
Your mission is to make the 2nd to last number be in 2nd.

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,060
You need to make a person with number 8 take the 2nd place.

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,700
(Help 2nd to last person come in 2nd place.)

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,730
(Who will hunt for the golden badge with her today?)

58
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,200
(The members come to have doubts toward the special agents.)

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,500
(If the agent fails a mission, a hint will be given...)

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,830
(to reveal the agent's identity.)

61
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,560
(Will the second to last person...)

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,600
(be able to take the second place?)

63
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,060
(30 minutes later, the members are gathering.)

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
(Kwang Soo is the first one to arrive.)

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,430
Hello. Good morning.

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,400
- Hello.
 -  Please pick a number.

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,390
(Kwang Soo does it without realising what it's for.)

68
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,400
Oh, no.

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm usually the unluckiest one.

70
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,230
It's six.

71
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,130
(Kwang Soo drew number six.)

72
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,890
Please go inside.

73
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,040
Okay.

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,200
What is this about?

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,630
(Kwang Soo enters the cafe with the number card.)

76
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,700
Hello, everyone.

77
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,730
I must be the first one to arrive.

78
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,290
- What number is it?
 -  I drew number six.

79
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,730
- I see.
 -  So it's about making a team.

80
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,530
(Next member to draw a number is Jae Seok.)

81
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,630
What's all this?

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,600
(What number would it be?)

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,700
Hello.

84
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,760
(Jae Seok picked number one.)

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
Please go inside through the entrance over there.

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,830
- Hello, Jae Seok.
 -  Kwang Soo.

87
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,860
Hello.

88
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,410
- Hello.
 -  What's your number?

89
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,740
- Number one.
 -  Really?

90
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,750
Yes, number one.

91
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,000
I get nervous without Jae Seok on my team.

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,600
Finally, the two unlucky members are in different teams.

93
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,240
I know. I'm number six.

94
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,630
Seriously.

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,270
I feel like this is really important.

96
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,930
(What number would it be?)

97
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,330
It's number eight.

98
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,400
(Haha drew number eight.)

99
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,860
(If so, would Haha be the person?)

100
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,330
The 2nd to the last number is number 8.

101
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,600
You should make number 8's team take the 2nd place.

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
It's eight.

103
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,230
I have a bad feeling about this.

104
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,330
Why are you in the centre?

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
There's nothing I can do about it.

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,270
You dressed like a gang member at a vacation spot.

107
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,160
(It looks like he's about to provoke a fight with a couple at beach.)

108
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,020
Stop making fun of me with my style.

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,500
Look how big your pupils are.

110
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,830
My goodness.

111
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,800
- You don't understand fashion.
 -  Your pupils...

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Your pupils are too big.

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,610
- This is the trend right now.
 -  Your pupils...

114
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,530
Look how black your pupils are. Are you wearing contacts?

115
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,300
- Hello.
 -  Oh, it's Jong Kook.

116
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,150
- Your number.
 -  What's your number?

117
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,300
- Is it okay to open this?
 -  Sure.

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,770
- Of course you can.
 -  Jong Kook.

119
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,700
My number is five.

120
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,270
My number is five.

121
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,100
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook are both in Yellow Team.)

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,100
Yes! I knew it.

123
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,990
- Each team has different colours.
 -  What?

124
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,100
- Yes.
 -  Right?

125
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,550
- Seok Jin is here.
 -  Welcome.

126
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,060
- What's your number?
 -  It's four.

127
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,630
It's four.

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,230
- Why?
 -  What a team!

129
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,320
- Why?
 -  What's wrong with it today?

130
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,530
- We are a team.
 -  What's wrong?

131
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,270
- Numbers 4, 5 and 6 are a team.
 -  We never had this combination.

132
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,630
So numbers 4, 5 and 6 are a team.

133
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,770
- Welcome, Gary.
 -  You are here.

134
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,200
- My number is two.
 -  Yes.

135
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,160
(Come and greet the lady.)

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,230
- Gosh.
 -  He's destined to serve.

137
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,830
He was trying to put it in a nice way.

138
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,790
Gary is there to serve his lady.

139
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,760
- Oh, Gary.
 -  Gary is there to serve his lady.

140
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,700
- Gary.
 -  Behave like a butler today.

141
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,200
(And the lady enters.)

142
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,700
- It's Ji Hyo.
 -  She's here.

143
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
- You must be 7 or 9.
 -  I'm 6.

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,920
- Did you say 6?
 -  No, you must be 9.

145
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
- You are nine.
 -  What are you talking about?

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
- What? It's 6.
 -  It's 6.

147
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,440
- I told you it's six.
 -  You were the one who got it wrong.

148
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
- Seriously.
 -  My goodness.

149
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,500
Goodness, Kwang Soo.

150
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,900
What were you doing?

151
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,550
- Now, we have the best butler.
 -  So this is my role today.

152
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,630
The best butler in the world.

153
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,730
All of a sudden, I feel so uncomfortable.

154
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,000
- I don't want this number.
 -  Are we a team?

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,760
Suddenly, Jong Kook is on pins and needles.

156
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,860
Now, we have a strong butler.

157
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,400
- He's also a butler now.
 -  Gosh, I don't like that.

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,030
(Jong Kook, welcome. You are now another butler.)

159
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,830
He has to serve his lady, too.

160
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,560
(All the members have arrived. Who will fill the remaining spots?)

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,300
(It's been a while since we invited this handsome middle-aged man.)

162
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,550
Long time no see.

163
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,830
(Ji Jin Hee)

164
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,460
Your jacket is torn apart.

165
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,400
(He ran spraying duck feathers to win the game four years ago.)

166
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,690
Look at this. He's the best.

167
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,300
(An actor with full of passion, Ji Jin Hee)

168
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,600
Can I open this?

169
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,260
(What number would he pick?)

170
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,500
It's lucky seven.

171
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,430
(Jin Hee drew number seven.)

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,930
- It's Ji Jin Hee.
 -  Welcome.

173
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,510
(Welcome back, Jin Hee.)

174
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,990
- Welcome!
 -  We have Jin Hee today.

175
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,720
- What's your number?
 -  It's seven.

176
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,060
- Good.
 -  I'm scared.

177
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,320
Jin Hee, you are more than welcome to shove them around.

178
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,130
(He has two butlers to shove around.)

179
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,720
- Oh, my.
 -  The best butlers.

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,430
I saw him at the parking lot a while ago.

181
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
So what?

182
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,610
(He's going competitive already.)

183
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,130
- He was very nice to me then.
 -  I see.

184
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,830
And he went, "So what?"

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,500
Someone's here.

186
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,100
- It's a nice car.
 -  We want a lady.

187
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,400
(The last spot is for the lady.)

188
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,830
(She had the secret meeting with the producer beforehand.)

189
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,620
Hello.

190
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,400
(The special actress is here as the special agent for today.)

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,730
(Special Agent H, Kim Hee Ae)

192
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,630
- She's here.
 -  Hee Ae.

193
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,430
- She's the queen.
 -  Oh, my.

194
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,620
(Please fall for my lies.)

195
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,700
She's the queen from Hyehwadong.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,600
- Welcome.
 -  Your number must be three.

197
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,090
- Yes.
 -  Come this way.

198
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,700
- Number three.
 -  This way.

199
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,450
- Oh, my.
 -  It's an honour.

200
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,600
- It's an honour.
 -  Please stand here.

201
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,860
She's the queen of Hyehwa High School.

202
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,530
I know about it very well.

203
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Hello.

204
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,600
You went to Hyewha and Jeon In Hwa went to Soongeui High School, right?

205
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,280
(He's bringing up the old times.)

206
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,060
My sister graduated Hyehwa High School.

207
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,060
All right.

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,230
(She forces to end the topic.)

209
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,530
- Okay, I'll stop talking now.
 -  Let's just shoot the show.

210
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,500
She doesn't like it when you try to buddy up with her.

211
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,530
(We need some time to get familiar.)

212
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,740
Today, Kim Hee Ae and Ji Jin Hee are here as guests.

213
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,960
- They're shooting a drama together.
 -  Yes.

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,600
The drama "Second to Last Love" will be broadcast soon.

215
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,400
- I see.
 -  So we prepared a special race.

216
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,330
You'll be able to obtain various kinds of invigorating food...

217
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,190
to help you get through the hot summer.

218
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,780
It's a race called Invigorating Foods.

219
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,870
Invigorating Foods.

220
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,630
- Invigorating Foods.
 -  That's right.

221
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,580
Now, you have a team according to the number you drew.

222
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,830
You are going to play various games we prepared.

223
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,200
We have prepared various invigorating food here.

224
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,730
You'll be able to get them through completing missions.

225
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,330
- What are the prizes?
 -  Can we see it now?

226
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,000
(Collection of invigorating food from everywhere)

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
(From red ginseng to fresh fruits and beef)

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,500
- Oh, it's fresh ginseng.
 -  Look at the fruits.

229
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,630
- It's Korean beef gift set.
 -  We don't usually buy them,

230
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,930
but I just want to take it when I see them here.

231
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,300
- Really.
 -  It's true.

232
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,200
- Look at the beef gift set.
 -  It's like I can't live without it.

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Who brought Chinese bush-clover?

234
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,230
I'm the one who needs it.

235
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,370
- Chinese bush-clover.
 -  Chinese bush-clover.

236
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,100
- This is great.
 -  Look at that yellow corvinas set.

237
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,630
- Yellow corvinas are the best.
 -  I want the Korean beef gift set.

238
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,600
(While everyone is focusing on the prizes...)

239
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,500
The 2nd to last number is number 8, right?

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
You need to make a person with number 8, the 2nd place.

241
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,850
(She needs to make Blue Team be in second.)

242
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,350
(Is the other special agent ready?)

243
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,400
(Possible candidates)

244
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,930
(One of them is her supporter.)

245
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,700
(I'm ready.)

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,870
(Jae Seok or Gary may be the other special agent.)

247
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,100
(Who would be the one to help Hee Ae?)

248
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,800
It's good to be outside.

249
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
How old is Seok Jin?

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's 51 years old.

251
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,900
(He's quite old.)

252
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,960
Why are you surprised?

253
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,580
I told the staff that I'd be so embarrassed...

254
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,760
if I don't understand the rules quickly.

255
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,530
They said Seok Jin still doesn't get it after doing it for seven years.

256
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,550
- Is that right?
 -  That's right.

257
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,000
(Hee Ae is relieved to have Seok Jin.)

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,790
Seok Jin doesn't understand the rules.

259
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll be the same.

260
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,390
(Hee Ae feels so familiar to Seok Jin.)

261
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,000
- By the way...
 -  I was so glad to hear that.

262
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,590
What are we doing today?

263
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,960
I have no idea.

264
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,830
(He has no clue like always.)

265
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
We are here. Is this the right place?

266
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,260
(What would be the first mission to win invigorating food?)

267
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,720
(Microphones are placed in the middle.)

268
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,960
- No one's here yet.
 -  What's all this?

269
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,370
- Why aren't they here?
 -  Something's strange.

270
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,610
You look young all of a sudden.

271
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,870
Don't say that. She lives young.

272
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
(She didn't change a bit from the old days.)

273
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,160
This is her favourite pose.

274
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,500
She speaks very elegantly. Okay.

275
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,030
(Gary transforms into an armrest for her.)

276
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,530
I'd be happy to support your arm.

277
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,630
She's the elegant lady.

278
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,300
She speaks very elegantly.

279
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,060
(The elegant lady)

280
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,830
Jin Hee, I'm begging you.

281
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,900
Would you please stop looking at us with suspicion?

282
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,100
- I was so surprised.
 -  He always does that.

283
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,300
- No, he doesn't.
 -  He does that every time.

284
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,190
He does not have desire to win.

285
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,500
- Are you serious?
 -  Yes.

286
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Don't you remember? He didn't even notice his torn jacket last time.

287
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,630
I hope everything would go fine today.

288
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,330
- He's continuously looking around.
 -  He's a pacifist.

289
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,300
It's time for the first mission.

290
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,430
- Jin Hee, please read this.
 -  Okay.

291
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,730
(Jin Hee will read the rules for them.)

292
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,300
(What? You don't have to go through there.)

293
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,930
- Goodness.
 -  You can come this way.

294
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
- There's enough space here.
 -  Why did you have to...

295
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,260
I hesitated for a second.

296
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,200
That was weird.

297
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,860
There's nothing to hesitate about.

298
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,200
You get suspicious on everything.

299
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,360
He really doubts about every single thing.

300
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
I worried that I'd be off the angle.

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,630
He was worried he'd be off the angle.

302
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,630
He did it in order to stay in the camera angle.

303
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,860
This mission is "Guess the Song."

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
Members must tie their legs to each other.

305
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,030
- And...
 -  Gosh.

306
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,130
After listening to a prelude of a song,

307
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,960
you'd come out and guess its title after naming your team.

308
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,300
You get one point if you guess the singer and the title right.

309
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,600
If you guess it wrong, you will receive punishment.

310
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,330
(Hee Ae has to make Blue Team take the second place.)

311
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,630
Put your legs in there.

312
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,060
- All right.
 -  We got it.

313
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,730
You'll play three rounds of this game.

314
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,160
- Let's go!
 -  Let's do this!

315
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,950
- Go!
 -  We can do this!

316
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,030
The first round is about songs from the 2000s.

317
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,420
- From the 2000s.
 -  Good.

318
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,200
It's when "Cyber Lover" by Turbo was released.

319
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,230
(What's Agent Hee Ae's special plan to make Haha place second?)

320
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,240
(What's the first song that was popular in 2000?)

321
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,300
Let's go.

322
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,130
(He senses something.)

323
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,300
(Already?)

324
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
(Blue Team gets to the answer zone first.)

325
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
In 3, 2 and 1.

326
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
It's by Davichi.

327
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,860
- "Love and War".
 -  "8282".

328
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,590
("Love and War", "8282")

329
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,630
What was it?

330
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,800
- Please move out of the zone.
 -  Move.

331
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,400
(They fail as two different answers were given and one didn't answer.)

332
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,560
Why didn't he say anything?

333
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
In 3, 2 and 1.

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
- It's "Love and War" by Davichi.
 -  It's "Love and War" by Davichi.

335
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,860
It's wrong.

336
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,460
Move out.

337
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,330
- Hurry and move out.
 -  Move out.

338
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,000
Here comes a Korean pop encyclopaedia.

339
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,960
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  It's "8282" by Davichi.

340
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,800
(He mumbles.)

341
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,930
He didn't say it.

342
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,160
- Only two of them answered.
 -  No way.

343
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,290
- Didn't you see it?
 -  It's not "8282".

344
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,830
- Hurry up.
 -  Isn't it "8282"?

345
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,400
(Be quiet.)

346
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,330
(Many of them complain at the same time.)

347
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,630
- "8282" is correct.
 -  Just a second.

348
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,700
Gosh, it's so noisy.

349
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,030
It's "8282".

350
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,900
They didn't succeed because...

351
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,050
- Gary doesn't know this song.
 -  Of course I do.

352
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,140
- See? You don't know.
 -  Baby, baby.

353
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,100
Let's play together today.

354
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,530
(When did Davichi sing that song?)

355
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,500
- What on earth?
 -  He doesn't know the song.

356
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,930
- Come on.
 -  They didn't get it right.

357
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,960
(These are the original lyrics to the song.)

358
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
- Do you know the song, Jin Hee?
 -  He does.

359
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,230
Try singing it, Jin Hee.

360
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,700
(He gets flustered.)

361
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,410
(He tries to sing it.)

362
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,860
What are you singing?

363
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,000
- This is nonsense.
 -  I can sing it.

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,330
- Does Hee Ae know the song?
 -  Of course she does.

365
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,960
- Do you know this song?
 -  You don't have to know it exactly.

366
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,800
- Baby, baby
 -  Baby, baby.

367
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,430
(She sings it most elegantly.)

368
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,060
- That's the easiest part.
 -  Come on.

369
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,000
It's not a round.

370
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,390
- Hee Ae always sings that way.
 -  She's always beautiful.

371
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,300
Since there's too much arguing...

372
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,600
- Why?
 -  Come on.

373
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
- Their answer is invalid.
 -  It's invalid.

374
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,930
Their answer doesn't count.

375
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,330
- Let's move on to next question.
 -  Why doesn't it count?

376
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,130
(Pink Team's answer doesn't count.)

377
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,490
- Good job.
 -  You're the fair judge.

378
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,680
Now,

379
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll give you the next song during the 2000s for the round 1.

380
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,530
(Here's the second song from the 2000s.)

381
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,290
- What is it?
 -  Let's go.

382
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,160
- 1, 2, 1, 2.
 -  1, 2, 1, 2.

383
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,690
(Blue Team runs to the microphones.)

384
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,860
- What's the answer?
 -  Get ready to answer.

385
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,230
In 3, 2 and 1.

386
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,460
- It's by Ivy.
 -  It's by Ivy.

387
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,230
Goodness.

388
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,160
(Why did they look so sure when they didn't know?)

389
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,100
- What was that?
 -  Did they even know the answer?

390
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,320
- It's a song by Ivy.
 -  Go slowly.

391
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,400
Let's listen to the song more.

392
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,360
Play the song a little more.

393
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,730
The song stops when a team comes forward.

394
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,530
- Of course.
 -  It should stop.

395
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,630
That's right.

396
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,760
All right. In 3, 2 and 1.

397
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
Do we just have to get the title right?

398
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,700
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

399
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,440
- "Sonata of Temptation" by Ivy.
 -  "Sonata of Temptation" by Ivy.

400
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,130
- Hee Ae didn't move her lips.
 -  Yes, she did.

401
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,160
- She didn't.
 -  She did.

402
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,030
(The answer is "Sonata of Temptation" by Ivy.)

403
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,960
- It was Ivy's song.
 -  Somebody do it.

404
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,550
- Didn't she dance like this?
 -  That's right.

405
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,630
This was the dance.

406
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,700
(The song is from her 2nd album released in 2007.)

407
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,600
(It became popular due to its unique dance choreography.)

408
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,700
Did the dance go like this?

409
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,300
(Hee Ae makes Ivy's song popular again in 2016.)

410
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,530
She knows how to have fun.

411
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,500
Why are you dancing like a robot?

412
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,300
There she goes.

413
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,360
Isn't this someone else's dance?

414
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,630
(Let's go.)

415
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,460
(Sonata of an excited robot)

416
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,730
She's full of fun.

417
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,330
We did it.

418
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,630
- Here's the next song.
 -  Okay.

419
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,300
(Here's another song from the 2000s.)

420
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
I've never heard of it before.

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
(Which song starts with a cyber-like sound?)

422
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,930
(Are they planning to just go for it again?)

423
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,960
- I know the answer.
 -  "Two of Us" by Chae Yeon.

424
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,630
(Does "Two of Us" by Chae Yeon really start like this?)

425
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,630
- I know the answer.
 -  "Two of Us" by Chae Yeon.

426
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,320
(The answer is "Two of Us" by Chae Yeon.)

427
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,510
(Blue Team is correct.)

428
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,960
I knew this song.

429
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,920
("Two of Us" by Chae Yeon is from her 2nd album in 2004.)

430
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,400
- Stop it.
 -  I knew this song.

431
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
(He does a happy ceremony with the dance.)

432
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
You don't know this song, Jin Hee.

433
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,630
(He strongly protests.)

434
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,460
- Dance to the song.
 -  Jin Hee doesn't know.

435
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,940
(He suddenly becomes a dancing machine.)

436
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,140
Come on, Jin Hee.

437
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,260
- See?
 -  He doesn't know it.

438
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,070
- You don't know the song.
 -  Yes, I do.

439
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,030
- This isn't the dance.
 -  The dance goes like this.

440
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,360
What you did is something else.

441
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,590
This is what you did.

442
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,300
- Wasn't this the dance?
 -  No.

443
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,530
You did well.

444
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,200
I watched this music video over 3000 times while serving the army.

445
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I only heard of Honey Family's songs while serving the army.

446
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
That's cool.

447
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,930
Over there.

448
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,030
From afar.

449
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,260
- Don't do it.
 -  I believe.

450
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,730
We can... Stop it.

451
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,300
- Is the next song from the 2000s?
 -  Yes.

452
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,630
(The next song is another one from the 2000s.)

453
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,430
- Hee Ae.
 -  Hurry.

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
(They sense what it is.)

455
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,930
How do you know from the sound of a bomb?

456
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,860
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  "Turn Back" by Kim Hyun Jung.

457
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,460
(The answer is "Turn Back" by Kim Hyun Jung.)

458
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,500
It's not correct.

459
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,200
(She gets a blow of air.)

460
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,080
- That was incorrect.
 -  I'm sorry.

461
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
Hey, you.

462
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,760
Move.

463
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,510
Goodness.

464
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,760
Did you hear what Hee Ae said?

465
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,860
She said, "Hey, you."

466
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,570
How could you make it blow out air?

467
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,380
- Let's go.
 -  "Bruise" by Kim Hyun Jung.

468
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,430
Right. It was "Bruise".

469
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,520
(Is the song "Bruise" by Kim Hyun Jung?)

470
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,600
- Yes.
 -  It's "Bruise".

471
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,800
That was the title.

472
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,110
I got confused about the song title.

473
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,200
Does the dance go like this?

474
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,300
("Bruise" by Kim Hyun Jung is from her 3rd album released in 2000.)

475
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,600
(It's the most famous hit song by Kim Hyun Jung.)

476
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,260
- Turn everything back
 -  Turn everything back.

477
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,330
- To the way things were before
 -  They're trying to spin.

478
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,420
Turn it back.

479
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,520
(Turn things back to the way things were.)

480
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,600
(Hey, hey!)

481
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,040
You seem excited.

482
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,940
I went clubbing a lot when this song came out.

483
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,630
In 1, 2, 3 and 4.

484
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,360
(Let's go, kids.)

485
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Turn everything back.

486
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,620
(The song stops.)

487
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,700
- I'll stop it now.
 -  Please do.

488
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,160
Here comes the next song.

489
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,500
- I said the wrong title.
 -  That was good.

490
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,030
- Let's go.
 -  Come on.

491
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,590
- Let's go.
 -  Come on.

492
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,930
- Hurry up.
 -  It's one of my favourite songs.

493
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,330
In 3, 2 and 1.

494
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,200
Will I be able to see you again.

495
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,230
All right.

496
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,630
(He whispers.)

497
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,630
- Let's listen to the song first.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

498
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,530
- "Poisoned Love" by Cho Jang Hyuck.
 -  "Poisoned Love" by Cho Jang Hyuck.

499
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,830
("Poisoned Love" by Cho Jang Hyuck is correct.)

500
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,450
Jin Hee doesn't know this song.

501
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,930
Yes, I do.

502
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,700
The other teams also knew what it was.

503
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,530
I forgot the title of the song.

504
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,760
- I didn't know the exact title.
 -  It's Kwang Soo's favourite song.

505
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
- Kwang Soo likes the song.
 -  It's my favourite song.

506
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,030
(He gets emotionally into it.)

507
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,610
Will I be able to see you again.

508
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,230
Why did you stop the song already?

509
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,230
- Don't sing.
 -  Why did you stop it already?

510
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,000
- Move away.
 -  I was just getting into it.

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,700
How can I release my emotions otherwise?

512
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,600
Did you forget?

513
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,960
It seems like...

514
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,160
it's a competition between me and Kwang Soo.

515
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,930
- Is the score 1 to 1 to 2?
 -  Yes.

516
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,200
Here's the next song.

517
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,450
- I know this.
 -  Do you know the song?

518
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,050
Please get ready.

519
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,800
- I know the answer.
 -  I know the answer.

520
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,100
(Do they already know the answer?)

521
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,030
- Move over, please.
 -  I know the answer.

522
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,690
- Just say anything.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

523
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,200
- "Have a Drink" by Zia.
 -  "Have a Drink" by Zia.

524
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,260
(It's incorrect.)

525
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,620
I was so certain.

526
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,340
- I'm sorry about that.
 -  I can't believe it.

527
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,790
- Please go back to your seats.
 -  I can't remember song titles.

528
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,500
- Isn't that it?
 -  Go back to your seats.

529
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,900
Goodness.

530
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,780
- Let's go.
 -  What's the title?

531
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,960
Isn't it by Baek Z Young?

532
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
- They wouldn't know the answer.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

533
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,860
- "I Won't Love" by Baek Z Young.
 -  "I Won't Love" by Baek Z Young.

534
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,430
(The answer is "I Won't Love" by Baek Z Young.)

535
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,840
- Wow, we got it right.
 -  Yes!

536
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,130
- That was the song.
 -  We got it.

537
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,500
Wow, it's a miracle.

538
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,820
I won't love any more.

539
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,230
- Ji Hyo.
 -  The person like you.

540
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,300
Don't lie.

541
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,800
(She's lying about not loving again.)

542
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,900
You shouldn't say that, Ji Hyo.

543
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,160
- She's full of love.
 -  She really is.

544
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,400
Here's the next song.

545
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,070
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

546
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,730
- Let's go.
 -  It's by Rain.

547
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,200
(It's definitely a song by Rain.)

548
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,300
It's by Rain.

549
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,860
- Say it together after the count.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

550
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,830
- It's by Rain.
 -  "I Am Rain".

551
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,730
("I Am Rain" by Rain)

552
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,790
(It's completely wrong.)

553
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,030
In 3, 2 and 1.

554
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,860
- "It's Raining" by Rain.
 -  "It's Raining" by Rain.

555
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,070
(The answer is "It's Raining" by Rain.)

556
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,630
That's right.

557
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,200
- What's wrong with you?
 -  You're good.

558
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,530
Jung Ji Hoon, Jung Ji Hoon!

559
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,730
("It's Raining" by Rain is from his 3rd album released in 2004.)

560
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,630
(It's popular for his dance with a slurping sound.)

561
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,800
(Let's do the slurp.)

562
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,700
That's right.

563
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,830
Seok Jin, be careful not to break your ribs.

564
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,460
(He warns him out of concern.)

565
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,830
That was good.

566
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,560
- Seok Jin's so funny.
 -  The current score...

567
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,870
is 3 to 1 to 2.

568
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,430
Is that the score?

569
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,030
The team to score five points first wins.

570
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,220
Let's go.

571
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,060
- Here's a hint as I'm Hee Ae's fan.
 -  Gosh, it's going crazy.

572
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,630
- This is...
 -  Hurry up and go.

573
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,760
- Hurry up and go.
 -  Go.

574
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,300
(What makes Gary get up to answer?)

575
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,220
Doesn't Gary know this song?

576
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,860
- This is Gary's specialty.
 -  Really?

577
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,130
(Will Pink Team answer it right?)

578
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,460
In 3, 2 and 1.

579
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,180
- Brown Eyes' "Don't Go, Don't Go".
 -  That's right.

580
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,950
- What did you just say?
 -  That's right?

581
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,330
("That's Right, That's Right" by Brown Eyes?)

582
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,430
- What was that?
 -  Wait.

583
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,960
- No. Wait.
 -  We don't have to say all together.

584
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,720
- It's okay if one of us answers.
 -  What was that?

585
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
- He just agreed on my answer.
 -  Yes, I did.

586
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
In 3, 2 and 1.

587
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,430
- Brown Eyes' "Don't Go, Don't Go".
 -  Brown Eyes' "Don't Go, Don't Go".

588
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,600
- It's not fair.
 -  Stop it.

589
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,160
- She just pretended to say it.
 -  Stop it.

590
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,960
(Why does Gary know about this song?)

591
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,230
I listened to it more than 10,000 times to write its lyrics.

592
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,060
(Gary wrote the lyrics for the song, "Don't Go, Don't Go".)

593
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,930
- It's hard to sing the high note.
 -  Yet, I.

594
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,000
(Gary is an emotional songwriter to write the sentimental lyrics.)

595
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,330
(Kwang Soo is into the song, too.)

596
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,100
(Thanks to Gary's hard work, Pink Team gets one point.)

597
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,900
Now, the score is 3 to 2 to 2.

598
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,360
- It's 3 to 2 to 2.
 -  It's really hard.

599
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,560
Here comes the next question.

600
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,970
Ballad songs usually start like this.

601
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,530
- I know this song.
 -  Hurry.

602
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,620
(She knows this song.)

603
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,830
What? What is the answer?

604
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,790
All right. Tell us the answer.

605
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,760
You need to tell us the answer now.

606
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,500
- In one...
 -  You can speak out the answer.

607
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,730
- You should.
 -  In 1, 2 and 3.

608
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,990
(I know the answer and I won't miss it.)

609
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,030
- It's "Sad Fate" by Nami.
 -  It's "Sad Fate" by Nami.

610
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,630
(The answer is "Sad Fate" by Nami.)

611
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,630
(The answer isn't "Sad Fate" by Nami.)

612
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,300
(It's the air again.)

613
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,520
- It can be the remake version.
 -  Yes, It can be.

614
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
- It's from 80s, isn't it?
 -  It's okay.

615
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,000
I thought it was the answer.

616
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,560
That song is really old.

617
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,930
It could've been remade in the 2000s.

618
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,960
(It could've been remade in the 2000s.)

619
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,950
(What is this mysterious song with piano?)

620
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,690
- I think I heard this before.
 -  What is this?

621
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,030
There are many songs which begin like this.

622
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,450
(They are all waiting to hear the first lyrics.)

623
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,600
- What are you doing?
 -  I only need the first part.

624
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,850
(You fill my heart.)

625
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,700
(They all noticed the song right after hearing the first lyrics.)

626
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,600
Please tell us the answer. All right.

627
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
In 3, 2 and 1.

628
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,100
- It's "One Love" by Park Sang Min.
 -  It's "One Love" by...

629
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,790
- That's wrong.
 -  They got it wrong.

630
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,430
- It's "One Love".
 -  That's right.

631
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,600
(The answer is "One Love" by Park Sang Min.)

632
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,100
I almost forgot the title.

633
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,000
("One Love" is from his 5th album released in 2000.)

634
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,160
(It was popular especially to boys at that time.)

635
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,930
(Seok Jin is confused with the lyrics.)

636
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,860
(The score is 4 to 2 to 2.)

637
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,520
This song is a masterpiece.

638
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,530
Let's move on to the next song.

639
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,990
(This can be the last song of the first round.)

640
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,430
- Wait.
 -  This kind of intro is common.

641
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
- Wait.
 -  This kind of intro is common.

642
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,230
- Hurry.
 -  Let's go.

643
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,260
(They all sensed the rhythm.)

644
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,430
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  They have to guess right away.

645
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,320
- Wait a second.
 -  It's by Baby V.O.X.

646
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,430
- That's wrong.
 -  They got it wrong.

647
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,560
(They guessed it wrong.)

648
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,630
(It's not by Baby V.O.X.)

649
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
- What was that?
 -  Move over.

650
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,720
- Wait. What is it?
 -  All right. In 3, 2 and 1.

651
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,630
- "Baby, One More Time" by Jewelry.
 -  "Baby, One More Time" by Jewelry.

652
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,720
(It's wrong.)

653
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,800
- "One More Time" by Jewelry.
 -  "One More Time" by Jewelry.

654
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,500
("One More Time" by Jewelry is the correct answer.)

655
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,860
What was that? "Baby, One More Time"?

656
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,160
It's "One More Time".

657
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
(Oh my baby)

658
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,730
This is their dance, right?

659
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:16,300
("One More Time" is from their 5th album released in 2008.)

660
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,160
(It's popular for the rhythmic and unique dance.)

661
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,810
- Very good.
 -  For the first round,

662
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,900
- Yellow Team wins.
 -  Yes!

663
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,030
(Yellow Team gets three points.)

664
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,430
Let's start the second round right away.

665
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,900
The 2nd round is about songs from 1990s.

666
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,330
- Good.
 -  Songs from 1990s?

667
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,360
Turbo was playing in the scene during 1990s.

668
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,530
(The second round of "Guess the Song" begins.)

669
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,000
(They sense it right away.)

670
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,490
(Dragged)

671
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,300
We were faster. I grabbed it first.

672
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,390
(They're trying so hard not to lose the microphones.)

673
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,600
- It's so obvious.
 -  You should know it.

674
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,620
(Whispering)

675
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,530
All right. In 3, 2 and 1.

676
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,300
It's "You Do Not Answer" by Kim Jong Seo.

677
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,800
- That's right.
 -  To whom should I lean on.

678
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,930
(Their answer is correct.)

679
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,400
("You Do Not Answer" is from his 1st album released in 1992.)

680
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,760
(To whom should I share my hurt feelings now?)

681
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,630
(Being highly emotional)

682
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,030
(She's also into the song.)

683
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,200
Do you know this song?

684
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,600
(Thumbs up!)

685
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,730
I want to say.

686
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,600
That I am so hurt.

687
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,000
(This is the feeling that I've been waiting for!)

688
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,620
That's right!

689
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,800
We all memorise its lyrics.

690
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,490
- It's from early 90s.
 -  It's so much easier.

691
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,030
- It's going to be easy.
 -  The music is on.

692
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,260
(What would be the second song?)

693
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,560
(A siren is wailing.)

694
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,100
- Come out.
 -  Let's go.

695
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,760
(They hurry to the microphones after hearing the mysterious siren.)

696
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,060
- Let's go.
 -  I know this.

697
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,630
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  Wait. Give us a few seconds.

698
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,530
What?

699
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,050
- In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  Gosh.

700
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,130
Wait.

701
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,260
- Give us another chance.
 -  No, please go back.

702
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,460
Move over.

703
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,730
- Just give us another chance.
 -  Hurry. Move over.

704
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,250
- Move.
 -  That's so cruel of you.

705
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,260
Move.

706
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,330
- You invited me here.
 -  I mean...

707
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,200
- I'm trying my best here.
 -  Look at her hair.

708
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
We didn't mean that.

709
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,030
- Are you ready?
 -  All right.

710
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,300
In 3, 2 and 1.

711
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,500
It's "Change" by Lee Jung Hyun.

712
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,700
(The answer is "Change" by Lee Jung Hyun.)

713
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,600
(Is it "Change" by Lee Jung Hyun?)

714
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,560
- "Change"?
 -  Yes.

715
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,030
(Blue Team got it right.)

716
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,630
(He imitates the famous moves of the song.)

717
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,030
("Change" is from her 1st album released in 1999.)

718
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,530
(The country became crazy about techno because of her song.)

719
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,790
(Blue Team dances to celebrate.)

720
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,860
(Hesitating)

721
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,050
(Do I need to dance again?)

722
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,130
Jin Hee doesn't know this song.

723
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,860
- What are you doing?
 -  Come on.

724
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,900
Just do it.

725
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,860
Just once.

726
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,090
(He's starting to dance.)

727
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,550
Why do you keep your hands like that?

728
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,190
That's not right. Make it like this.

729
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,760
- Pretend the microphone is here.
 -  Does he want something else?

730
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,830
Does he think it's boring?

731
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
- Blue Team got one point.
 -  It's crazy.

732
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,450
(The score is 0 to 1 to 1.)

733
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,760
(What is this song?)

734
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,630
- I heard this before.
 -  Me, too.

735
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
- Go.
 -  Let's go.

736
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,320
Hurry.

737
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,460
(Two teams head towards the microphones.)

738
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,960
- Hurry.
 -  Let's go.

739
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,450
(Yellow Team arrives earlier.)

740
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,830
- You're not in the line.
 -  You went out of the line.

741
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,800
It's "Love is a Cold Temptation", but was the singer Bang Mi?

742
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,200
(Was the singer Bang Mi?)

743
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,360
(That's wrong.)

744
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,950
- Don't count that one.
 -  I didn't answer it.

745
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,950
- I talked to myself.
 -  He was just talking to himself.

746
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,590
- Why? What's wrong?
 -  It's our turn. Move.

747
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,830
- All right.
 -  Please guess the answer.

748
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,100
(It's Pink Team's turn now.)

749
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
In 1, 2 and 3.

750
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,030
It's "Love is a Cold Temptation" by Yang Soo Kyung.

751
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,100
It's not right.

752
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,330
(They got it right.)

753
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,120
- Really?
 -  Wasn't the singer Min Hye Kyung?

754
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,160
It's Yang Soo Kyung.

755
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:45,710
("Love is a Cold Temptation" is from her 4th album released in 1991.)

756
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,300
- Good job.
 -  We were so close.

757
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,900
- Well done.
 -  Love is a cold temptation.

758
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,560
(The score is 0 to 2 to 1.)

759
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,200
Still, it's inevitable.

760
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,580
That was a tough question.

761
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,930
- I thought is was Min Hye Kyung.
 -  You're so foolish.

762
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,930
It's tough.

763
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,360
All right. Here's the next song.

764
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
(What's the next song?)

765
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,560
Let's go.

766
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,560
(Let's go!)

767
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,190
Gosh. Slow down!

768
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,230
(Pink Team is quick to take over the microphones.)

769
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,630
Lee Ja Yeon.

770
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,790
- Tell us the answer. In 3, 2 and 1.
 -  The singer is Lee Ja Yeon.

771
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,130
- Please tell us now.
 -  No, it is Kim Ji Ae.

772
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,530
- Yes. That's right.
 -  In 3, 2 and 1.

773
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,360
It's "Spiteful Person" by Kim Ji Ae.

774
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,400
Gosh.

775
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,430
- Yes.
 -  You gave them too much time.

776
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,300
- You're spiteful
 -  That's unfair.

777
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,260
("Spiteful Person" is from her 4th album released in 1990.)

778
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,340
I knew it.

779
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,260
I knew it right when I heard the intro.

780
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,250
(They all remember its catchy lyrics.)

781
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,900
- Let's move back a little.
 -  Isn't this song from 1980s?

782
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
The score is 1 to 3 to 2.

783
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,360
Here comes the next song.

784
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,630
I know this song.

785
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,200
- I know this song.
 -  I forgot the title.

786
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,230
(Where did I hear this melody before?)

787
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,900
(They're getting close to the answer.)

788
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,430
(It's 3 seconds before the first phrase.)

789
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,460
- Let's go!
 -  Go.

790
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,430
(Everyone hurries to the microphones.)

791
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,430
Be careful.

792
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,460
(Falling down)

793
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,860
- Watch out.
 -  I got it!

794
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,060
(They do whatever it takes to get the microphones.)

795
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,100
- My gosh.
 -  Are we fighting here?

796
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,800
- I'm just kidding.
 -  Wait a second.

797
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,620
- I know the answer.
 -  What is it?

798
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,060
- It's by Lee Sang Woo...
 -  Let just one person answer it.

799
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,730
Jin Hee, you say it.

800
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,300
- It's Lee Sang Woo's...
 -  He got it wrong.

801
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,520
- No.
 -  It's...

802
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,730
"Met Her 100m Before"

803
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,460
(The answer is "Met Her 100m Before" by Lee Sang Woo.)

804
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
Is it 10m then?

805
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,530
No, it's definitely not 10m.

806
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,560
Move over.

807
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,730
(Move over so we can answer.)

808
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,800
- Isn't that the answer?
 -  It should end with away.

809
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,920
- No, that's wrong.
 -  All right.

810
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,460
- Just follow him this time.
 -  Answer now.

811
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,620
In 3, 2 and 1.

812
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,730
It's "Met Her 100m Away" by Lee Sang Woo.

813
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,200
("Met Her 100m Away" by Lee Sang Woo is correct.)

814
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,160
- Yes.
 -  Really?

815
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,400
- Wasn't that our answer?
 -  No, it's different.

816
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,190
Singing the song leads us to the title.

817
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,160
I met her 100m away.

818
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,460
("Met Her 100m Away" is from his 2nd album released in 1991.)

819
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,200
Should I give her a bucket of roses?

820
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,830
- A bucket of roses?
 -  What was that?

821
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,600
(He changes the lyrics into very weird ones.)

822
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,490
(He is an astonishing songwriter.)

823
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,360
We were so close.

824
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,460
(The score is 2 to 4 to 2.)

825
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,630
- Let's get this one right.
 -  Here comes the next song.

826
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,700
Let's do this.

827
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,360
I got it.

828
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,400
Let's do this.

829
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,720
(Okay. Let's go!)

830
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,880
Let's go.

831
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,900
Hurry up.

832
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,250
(Jae Seok reacts as soon as he hears the first part.)

833
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,260
- Kim Won Jun is the singer.
 -  Okay. In 3, 2 and 1.

834
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,500
It's "After All Asleep" by Kim Won Jun.

835
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,490
(Is it really "After All Asleep" by Kim Won Jun?)

836
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,720
- They got it right.
 -  That's right!

837
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,330
- They were correct.
 -  All right!

838
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,260
I knew the lyrics.

839
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,530
I also knew the answer.

840
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,030
("After All Asleep" by Kim Won Jun was his debut song in 1992.)

841
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,960
After all asleep.

842
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,100
It's all right to remember a lot of things

843
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,600
I sigh at the moments I've lost.

844
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,060
As Pink Team earned...

845
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,460
five points, you move up to round two.

846
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,730
We're tied.

847
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,010
For the other two teams,

848
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,700
- I'll give you one more song.
 -  Okay.

849
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,460
(The last question will determine which team places second.)

850
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,760
(For Haha to win second place, he needs to get this right.)

851
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,430
(If you answer correctly this time, I'll give you a special compliment.)

852
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,860
(The final round to determine second place starts.)

853
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,800
(They're very focused.)

854
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,960
(They run forward first.)

855
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,260
- Do you know the song?
 -  No.

856
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,230
Don't be too impatient.

857
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,060
- I thought you knew.
 -  Don't be so impatient.

858
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,850
- Go on.
 -  Go back to your seat.

859
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,230
- Let's listen to it longer.
 -  Shall we do that?

860
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,900
- Let's go back to our seat.
 -  Why don't you go back?

861
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,430
(The song plays for the second time.)

862
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,500
Pass.

863
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,960
Don't pass it.

864
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,200
I have no idea.

865
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,800
(The first verse starts to play.)

866
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,630
(On a melancholy day)

867
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,350
(They run toward the microphones as soon as the first verse plays.)

868
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,320
- Stop it.
 -  Let go.

869
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,900
- What's the answer?
 -  That's not the original song.

870
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,470
Is this a remix?

871
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,930
- Isn't it?
 -  It's not the original.

872
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,930
This isn't the original song.

873
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,110
- One, two, three.
 -  Marronnier Park.

874
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,460
- Marronnier.
 -  Marronnier Park.

875
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,000
She said Marronnier Park.

876
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,900
(Yellow Team is wrong.)

877
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,500
- Isn't it Marronnier Park?
 -  Marronnier Park?

878
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
(She created a new song, "Daehakro Love" by Marronnier Park.)

879
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,970
- "Cocktail Love" by Marronnier.
 -  "Cocktail Love" by Marronnier.

880
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,030
That's correct.

881
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,360
("Cocktail Love" by Marronnier is correct.)

882
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,900
- Goodness.
 -  It's Marronnier's song.

883
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,830
("Cocktail Love" by Marronnier is from their first album in 1994.)

884
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,730
I thought it was Marronnier Park.

885
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,330
- I love this song.
 -  I thought it was correct.

886
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,400
Now, take your shoes off.

887
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,700
Anyone from the team who knows the answer can come up.

888
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,100
- Is that so?
 -  Okay.

889
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,430
The current total score is...

890
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,800
We're all tied.

891
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,000
- That's amazing.
 -  Is it true?

892
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,130
- This is the current total score.
 -  Let's win our special victory.

893
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,260
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

894
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,300
We're the original victory.

895
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,700
- Special victory.
 -  Special victory.

896
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,050
- Special victory. Hurrah.
 -  Hurrah.

897
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:12,580
- Original victory
 -  Original victory.

898
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,800
Our team will win anyway.

899
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,500
Why are you embarrassed?

900
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,830
(Everyone is embarrassed.)

901
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,400
Why do you feel embarrassed?

902
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,880
What kind of cheer was that?

903
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,200
Goodness.

904
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,230
- Here's the next song.
 -  Okay!

905
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,930
(Round three that will determine the winning team starts.)

906
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,900
(She stumbles.)

907
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
(She pauses and goes forward again.)

908
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,460
I think I know the answer.

909
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,400
- One, two, three.
 -  Move away.

910
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,860
It's a song by Girl's Day. This is the dance.

911
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,300
- I'll answer it.
 -  "Something" by Girl's Day!

912
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,800
(Blue Team dominates at the beginning of round three.)

913
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,470
- Original victory
 -  Original victory.

914
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,300
Original victory.

915
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,970
Gosh, I knew the song.

916
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,970
- That was impressive.
 -  Good job.

917
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,470
Wow, that was great.

918
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,370
You're impressive.

919
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,820
Gosh, I was so close.

920
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,900
He knows so much about girl groups.

921
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,800
(He's a girl group specialist.)

922
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,900
- It was so close.
 -  About girl groups?

923
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,260
- All right.
 -  Seok Jin.

924
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,030
(Does he already know the answer by listening to such a short opening?)

925
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,260
(Viewers, can you guess which song it is?)

926
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,900
- What's the answer?
 -  It's Jong Kook's favourite song.

927
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,700
- "Last Love" by Kim Bum Soo.
 -  That's correct.

928
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
("Last Love" by Kim Bum Soo is correct.)

929
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,720
My last love

930
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,760
I've heard Jong Kook sing it a lot.

931
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,000
Really?

932
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
He even sings it in his sleep!

933
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,260
He sings this song a lot.

934
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,610
He always sings this song instead of his own.

935
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,500
I know it right away by listening to the opening.

936
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,900
- You knew it right away.
 -  I know it.

937
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,470
I don't know who it is, but please come back.

938
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,400
(What are you talking about?)

939
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,610
What?

940
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,930
Seriously.

941
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,100
I don't know who you are, but please come back.

942
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,260
- Please.
 -  What's wrong with you?

943
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,130
- You sing this a lot.
 -  I only like the song.

944
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,310
I don't know who it is.

945
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,500
- He answered it correctly.
 -  Goodness.

946
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,360
The score is 1 to 0 to 1.

947
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,610
Here's your next song.

948
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,600
I need to recognise the opening.

949
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,630
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

950
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,430
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

951
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,720
(While everyone runs forward, )

952
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,860
(she stays behind alone.)

953
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,990
- It's my turn to answer.
 -  Wait.

954
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,940
- He was so fast.
 -  It's okay.

955
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,530
- One, two, three.
 -  "Growl" by EXO.

956
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,560
That's right!

957
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,760
That's right.

958
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,630
- That's right.
 -  Pardon me.

959
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,120
- Please play something I know.
 -  I'm sorry, but...

960
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,030
- let's stand in a circle.
 -  Seriously.

961
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,400
He's too close.

962
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,300
- His seat is the closest.
 -  If not,

963
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,980
let's switch seats.

964
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,620
- All seats are the same.
 -  I know.

965
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,800
Don't let them discuss.

966
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,060
- This is the shortest distance.
 -  To make it fair,

967
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,560
we'll take out two microphones.

968
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,830
Three points are given in the last round.

969
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,060
Don't say that.

970
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,240
You won't be able to get out of your seat.

971
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,900
No one can get out of here.

972
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,910
- Gary, don't stay still.
 -  Let's go.

973
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,900
All right, here's the next song.

974
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,420
(I'll do it too.)

975
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,470
- Look at Ji Hyo.
 -  Hey.

976
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,400
(He recognises the song.)

977
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,350
One, two, three.

978
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,560
"Penniless Youth" by Buck.

979
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,800
("Penniless Youth" by Buck is correct.)

980
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,470
I was so close.

981
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,470
("Penniless Youth" by Buck is from the first album released in 1997.)

982
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,200
Why did you do that?

983
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
My ribs are broken.

984
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,400
- Why did you do that?
 -  My ribs are broken.

985
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,730
What happened?

986
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,430
Didn't you hit me as you went out?

987
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,230
- It really hurts.
 -  I didn't hit you.

988
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,980
Here's the next song.

989
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,060
(Currently, the score is 1 to 1 to 1.)

990
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,160
- All right.
 -  Ji Hyo.

991
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,100
- Ji Hyo is also holding him down.
 -  He should lay him down.

992
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,400
Ji Hyo, I didn't think clearly.

993
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,580
Wait a minute.

994
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,130
- This is going to be hard.
 -  Block Blue Team.

995
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,820
Hey, stop it.

996
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,100
I'll go instead.

997
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,520
- Don't do it.
 -  Wait a minute.

998
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,600
- Go now.
 -  Wait.

999
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,200
(Jong Kook grabs the microphone.)

1000
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,860
- Jong Kook was the fastest.
 -  He grabbed it.

1001
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,330
One, two, three.

1002
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,600
- Is it "Speed" by Kim Gun Mo?
 -  That's it.

1003
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,630
("Speed" by Kim Gun Mo is correct.)

1004
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,500
Why did you hold me back?

1005
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,200
I know this song too.

1006
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:21,100
("Speed by Kim Gun Mo is from his fourth album released in 1996.)

1007
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,090
- Yellow Team...
 -  Did they place first?

1008
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,760
Is the winner of this game.

1009
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,730
You earned two coupons.

1010
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,400
We'll determine the second place that will win one coupon.

1011
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
Your current score is 1 to 1.

1012
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,630
(My team has to lose for Haha to place second.)

1013
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,470
(If he doesn't win, a hint on the agent's identity is given.)

1014
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,240
(What will happen to Agent H?)

1015
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,000
- Don't hold me too tightly.
 -  Jae Seok.

1016
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,360
He can't get out.

1017
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,860
- Jae Seok knows.
 -  Stop it.

1018
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,300
(Let's slowly take action to make Blue Team place second.)

1019
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,000
(Where are you going?)

1020
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,300
He doesn't know the song.

1021
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,970
Hurry up.

1022
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,430
(I can't let you go no matter what.)

1023
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,830
(They're struggling.)

1024
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,930
(He falls down.)

1025
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,030
Jae Seok doesn't know either.

1026
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,060
(There's no such thing as fair play in Running Man.)

1027
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,470
Put your foot there.

1028
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
(He throws a shoe.)

1029
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,060
(Kwang Soo throws his large shoe toward the microphone.)

1030
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,400
(Jae Seok stretches Haha's legs.)

1031
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,910
(He screams in pain.)

1032
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,150
- It hurts.
 -  Stop it.

1033
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,080
You don't even know the song.

1034
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,830
What's wrong with you people?

1035
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,800
Do you even know the song?

1036
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,130
Do you even know the song?

1037
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,100
(Blue Team must get up.)

1038
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,630
(This is their chance.)

1039
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,100
- Do you know it?
 -  I know the answer.

1040
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,200
- One, two, three.
 -  "No. 1" by BOA.

1041
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,970
"No. 1" by BOA.

1042
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,300
(The agent's mission would succeed at the same time.)

1043
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,680
"No. 1" by BOA.

1044
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,760
Really?

1045
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,860
(Blue Team answers correctly.)

1046
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,270
He got it right.

1047
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,900
Wow.

1048
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,560
- That was good.
 -  Blue Team places second.

1049
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,330
(Blue Team wins second place.)

1050
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,300
(Since she accomplished her mission, her identity won't be revealed.)

1051
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,000
Yellow Team earned two coupons.

1052
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,500
- Congratulations.
 -  Blue Team earned one coupon.

1053
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,160
(Agent H Kim Hee Ae succeeds in making Haha win second place.)

1054
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,160
(Round 1 of the agent's mission is a success.)

1055
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,930
I haven't lost in a long time.

1056
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,060
They're like machines. How could they guess...

1057
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,900
- I know.
 -  by listening to the opening?

1058
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,560
Thanks to you, our team kept our reputation.

1059
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,940
- I know.
 -  Goodness.

1060
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,900
Gary knows all the hip hop songs.

1061
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,230
Why didn't they play any hip hop?

1062
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,130
They should have played hip hop.

1063
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,800
- It's popular these days.
 -  My children love hip hop too.

1064
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,130
I know. Hip hop is popular now.

1065
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,320
Does Announcer Na have a lot of complaints?

1066
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,600
Because you're too busy?

1067
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,360
She doesn't complain, but...

1068
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,760
- she gets a little disappointed...
 -  Does she?

1069
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,400
When I can't join the family on vacation.

1070
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Does your child like you?

1071
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,200
Of course.

1072
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,100
- You must do your best.
 -  I try.

1073
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,060
I don't go out or anything.

1074
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,060
After work, I go straight home.

1075
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,630
That's what I do.

1076
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,100
It's hard because there's only one year difference between my sons.

1077
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,470
They're going through puberty.

1078
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,800
- Is that so?
 -  Whether it's puberty or not,

1079
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,330
it's really tough these days.

1080
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,230
I didn't know raising children would be this difficult.

1081
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,380
I have so much respect for all the mothers out there.

1082
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,630
I was really surprised.

1083
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,330
(He can sympathise.)

1084
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,700
I never thought babies needed that many diapers a day.

1085
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,060
I really didn't know.

1086
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,630
(While they're talking about mothers...)

1087
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,860
We're here. It's a market.

1088
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,030
We're at a market.

1089
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,080
- They sell tasty foods.
 -  They do have a lot of foods.

1090
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,560
I love traditional markets.

1091
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,760
Me too.

1092
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,600
(They'll have their second race in a traditional market.)

1093
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
It's been a very long time since I visited a market.

1094
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,470
I love this place.

1095
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,900
(This traditional market sells a lot of tasty foods.)

1096
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,500
(What mission will they do there?)

1097
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,070
- Oh yes.
 -  Food!

1098
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,200
Really?

1099
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,450
(Is that tteokbokki?)

1100
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,900
Why is there tteokbokki at a barbecue restaurant?

1101
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,230
Tteokbokki at a barbecue restaurant?

1102
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,030
Please find the dish of your colour and enjoy the food.

1103
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,810
- Really?
 -  Can we eat this?

1104
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,970
- Yes, please.
 -  Thank you.

1105
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,060
- Do we eat now?
 -  Yes.

1106
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,130
Don't we have to count the number of rice cakes?

1107
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,900
We're eating tteokbokki at a barbecue restaurant.

1108
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,200
- Do we eat now?
 -  They sell beef here.

1109
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,070
Find the right dish that has your team's colour.

1110
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,330
- Don't count out loud.
 -  Please help yourself.

1111
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,200
This is for free, right?

1112
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,360
(They never give things for free.)

1113
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,340
- It's good.
 -  I feel uncomfortable.

1114
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,450
Jin Hee.

1115
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,900
- It's so good.
 -  It is.

1116
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,000
Please enjoy it.

1117
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,330
- Did you enjoy it?
 -  Yes.

1118
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,860
All right. We prepared a mission...

1119
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,360
- to carry out in this market.
 -  Okay.

1120
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,260
We named the mission...

1121
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,460
"Mrs Market".

1122
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,960
You named it after the drama Hee Ae appeared, right?

1123
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,130
"Mrs Market"?

1124
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,690
"We'll give you an Exchange Card if you earn the most points."

1125
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,300
"The first game is Jang Geum's Tteokbokki."

1126
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,900
"Please buy the tteokbokki ingredients."

1127
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We used 14 ingredients for the tteokbokki you just had.

1128
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,000
But we'll tell you what seven ingredients are.

1129
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,500
"The basic ingredients we used are rice cake, water, chilli paste,"

1130
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,200
"sugar, seasoning, fish cake and cabbage."

1131
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,040
"Please buy the rest seven ingredients."

1132
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,630
"But if one of the three members' feet touch the ground,"

1133
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,930
"you fail."

1134
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,300
Aren't you good at cooking?

1135
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,930
There's taco sauce in it.

1136
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,530
- That's why it tasted like this.
 -  Wow.

1137
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,830
Gosh, you're amazing.

1138
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,960
- This tastes like...
 -  He knows many good restaurants.

1139
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,060
- Who knows?
 -  Jin Hee.

1140
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,460
I think they put ingredients we'd never think of.

1141
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,560
Gosh, this is hard.

1142
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,060
- I don't know what's in it.
 -  Let's go.

1143
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,730
(What are the 7 ingredients?)

1144
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,560
Sir, please give us onion and garlic.

1145
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,110
(Pink Team buys onion and garlic.)

1146
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,030
- We don't need many.
 -  We need just a few.

1147
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,860
We'll buy the same ingredients.

1148
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,220
You can't do that.

1149
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,630
Gary, go inside and buy there.

1150
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,330
Go inside the store.

1151
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,460
(Confrontation)

1152
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,900
Goodness.

1153
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,330
(Do you want some special spanking?)

1154
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,460
- Hey.
 -  Come over here.

1155
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,960
Hee Ae's used to our show now.

1156
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,430
I'll hit you with Hee Ae's foot.

1157
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,060
Goodness.

1158
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,900
What would it be? Eggplant?

1159
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,630
No, I don't think so.

1160
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,360
- There were vegetables.
 -  Shepherd's purse?

1161
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,600
- There were vegetables.
 -  Bracken.

1162
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,160
(What? Bracken?)

1163
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,900
(Was bracken in this tteokbokki?)

1164
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,730
- Let's buy bracken.
 -  Okay. Let's buy it.

1165
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,350
Please give us bracken.

1166
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,360
We want bracken.

1167
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,560
Let's buy kelp.

1168
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,400
- Let's buy a bit of kelp.
 -  Kelp?

1169
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,680
The sauce can be sticky because of rice cake.

1170
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,060
We'll count on your judgment.

1171
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,560
- Do we buy kelp then?
 -  My judgment?

1172
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,460
(This special housewife chooses kelp.)

1173
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,530
Let's buy kelp, then.

1174
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,630
(Meanwhile, Jin Hee is...)

1175
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,760
We need walnuts.

1176
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,200
Please give us walnuts.

1177
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,630
(Walnuts?)

1178
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,930
(At the restaurant a while ago)

1179
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,630
- This is...
 -  It's not peanut but walnut.

1180
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,860
It's walnut.

1181
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,700
Let me see.

1182
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,030
(They find walnut.)

1183
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,230
(Jin Hee is a gourmet.)

1184
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,300
- Jin Hee is very...
 -  He's like Jang Geum.

1185
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,860
Sir. Excuse me.

1186
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,830
Excuse me.

1187
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,530
Hello?

1188
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,130
Hello?

1189
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,630
Sir!

1190
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,510
(He's in a hurry.)

1191
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,830
Jin Hee, we have to go now.

1192
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,840
Sir. Hurry.

1193
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,050
What is it?

1194
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,230
What was it again?

1195
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,900
- Licorice?
 -  Please give us licorice.

1196
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,830
- A herb?
 -  Jang Geum is in its title.

1197
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,130
I'm sure they used healthy herbs.

1198
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,200
Licorice?

1199
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,520
How many seconds left?

1200
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,800
- 10 seconds.
 -  10 seconds?

1201
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,000
Sir, see you later!

1202
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,330
Goodbye. Come here.

1203
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,130
(Blue Team buys licorice.)

1204
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,000
Everyone, we'll open all 14 ingredients we used...

1205
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,800
in "Jang Geum's Tteokbokki".

1206
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,730
- Okay.
 -  Take out the ingredients...

1207
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,210
you bought if you got them right.

1208
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,230
Gosh, I'm not sure if we bought the right ingredients.

1209
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,460
But we have no choice now.

1210
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,260
(What are the 7 ingredients?)

1211
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,230
Then, the first ingredient is...

1212
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,260
red pepper powder.

1213
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,300
(Red pepper powder)

1214
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,060
(Goodness.)

1215
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,360
You forgot red pepper powder?

1216
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,460
Great!

1217
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,100
(It's a basic ingredient.)

1218
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,730
- Red pepper powder is...
 -  Gosh.

1219
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,460
I thought you're a good cook. Are you not?

1220
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,860
It happens.

1221
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,930
- There are still six left.
 -  Okay.

1222
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,860
- The second one is...
 -  Gosh.

1223
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,060
Onion.

1224
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,230
(Onion)

1225
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,700
- Onion.
 -  Onion!

1226
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,500
They forgot onion, too.

1227
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,610
- No. We have onion.
 -  Onion.

1228
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,230
- No, this is garlic.
 -  That's garlic.

1229
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,600
- Oh, I found it.
 -  They have it.

1230
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,210
- Gosh, I was worried.
 -  Good.

1231
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,200
- I'm nervous.
 -  The third one is...

1232
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,330
Please.

1233
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,360
Green onion.

1234
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,600
(They didn't buy it.)

1235
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,800
You didn't buy green onion?

1236
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,300
That's unbelievable.

1237
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,860
- You need green onion.
 -  It's so important.

1238
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,040
Have you seen tteokbokki without green onion?

1239
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,860
You forgot it.

1240
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,960
- The fourth one is...
 -  Gosh.

1241
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,130
- Kelp?
 -  starch syrup.

1242
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,630
(He had it ready.)

1243
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,790
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

1244
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,000
There's always starch syrup in tteokbokki.

1245
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,700
Now, we have three left to go.

1246
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,110
- This is hard.
 -  Gosh.

1247
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,280
We told you that the tteokbokki was very special.

1248
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,430
Good. We made it.

1249
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,000
- Angelica root?
 -  No way.

1250
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,200
- Ginseng?
 -  It's curry powder.

1251
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,350
That's right. It was curry not taco sauce.

1252
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,760
You only added a tiny bit.

1253
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,000
- I didn't know there was curry.
 -  I couldn't taste curry at all.

1254
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
- You fooled me. You're amazing.
 -  The next one is...

1255
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,510
pear juice.

1256
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,000
- Pear juice?
 -  I was going to buy it. Gosh.

1257
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,160
I never thought of it.

1258
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,360
- The last one is...
 -  I think we got it.

1259
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,760
A kind of nuts.

1260
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,100
- That's right.
 -  Good.

1261
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,360
- We must have the right one.
 -  Great.

1262
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,430
(Blue Team seems confident.)

1263
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,800
- It's walnut.
 -  Yes!

1264
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,030
- Yes!
 -  I told you.

1265
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,560
(They all get it right.)

1266
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,330
It's me who bought walnut.

1267
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,460
- Blue Team got five right items.
 -  Yes.

1268
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,200
And the other two teams got three correct.

1269
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,740
Please show me what you bought.

1270
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,300
We bought kelp. Hee Ae said we must buy this.

1271
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,760
I told her we needed starch syrup. But she insisted on kelp.

1272
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,430
(Special housewife's mistake)

1273
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,900
And we also bought Cheongyang chilli.

1274
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,230
We found it very spicy.

1275
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,450
- Right.
 -  We have garlic, too.

1276
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,830
We bought peanuts. Because we weren't sure...

1277
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,070
- if it was peanut or walnut.
 -  Right.

1278
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,200
This team bought more than seven items.

1279
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,500
- But they bought eight.
 -  No, they said we can buy more.

1280
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,160
- Do you have more than seven?
 -  Yes.

1281
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,100
- Take items away from them.
 -  This is nonsense.

1282
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,460
- This is ridiculous.
 -  Gosh.

1283
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,130
- This is total nonsense!
 -  We asked them.

1284
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,360
We asked you before we left.

1285
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,400
- You could buy only seven items.
 -  Right.

1286
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,760
Anyway, these are the main items.

1287
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,200
We bought this for Jin Hee's wife.

1288
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,750
I bought this ginseng for myself.

1289
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,930
They even bought ginseng and angelica.

1290
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,400
- That's a foul.
 -  Gosh.

1291
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,460
Hee Ae, please say something. Does that make sense?

1292
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,960
- That's nonsense.
 -  See?

1293
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,300
That means you failed.

1294
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,360
Let me announce the result of the first game.

1295
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,360
Although Blue Team has five right items, they failed.

1296
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,560
Isn't it amazing that we bought this many items in a limited time?

1297
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,450
Don't you think you should compliment us?

1298
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,630
Good job.

1299
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,800
- Every team gets one point.
 -  Nice!

1300
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,630
But there are more missions left.

1301
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,200
We'll decide a winning team in the two missions left.

1302
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,560
- That's chicken.
 -  Chicken.

1303
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,600
It's dakgangjung.

1304
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,630
- Gosh, I like it.
 -  It's chicken.

1305
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,030
Is it Jang Geum's chicken as well?

1306
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,700
(Jin Hee starts inspecting it.)

1307
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,190
This game is very objective.

1308
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,360
(What mission will they do with this dakgangjung?)

1309
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,600
- Please help yourself.
 -  This is strange.

1310
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,000
(They're very distrustful.)

1311
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,160
Please enjoy. It's very tasty.

1312
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,160
- That's very famous here.
 -  It's good.

1313
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,630
(Gary finds something.)

1314
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,000
Grain powder?

1315
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,950
(Hee Ae bursts into laughter.)

1316
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,360
What is he talking about?

1317
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,630
(Did they put grain powder because it's summer?)

1318
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,400
Gary is dissecting the dakgangjung.

1319
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,130
(Dakgangjung Detective Gary)

1320
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,230
Please enjoy it.

1321
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,090
(She bites into the dakgangjung elegantly.)

1322
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,200
It's good.

1323
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,630
- Hee Ae.
 -  What?

1324
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,360
Although you're hungry, don't just eat up.

1325
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,300
(She's caught.)

1326
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,460
I have no idea.

1327
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,230
(She seems to have given up on everything.)

1328
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,830
Please guess the total weight...

1329
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,150
of the dakgangjung you just had...

1330
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,160
- What?
 -  What?

1331
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,310
And the plate.

1332
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,580
Then, you should go to...

1333
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,900
a fruit store and buy fruits that weigh the same.

1334
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,830
How can you make such an annoying game?

1335
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,130
(That's why we handed it right into your hands.)

1336
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,360
- Guess the weight.
 -  He's measuring with his hands.

1337
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,300
Don't forget to add the weight of your plates.

1338
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,600
(What fruit will weigh the same as the dakgangjung and the plate?)

1339
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,300
(Pink Team chooses an oriental melon.)

1340
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,030
Oh, this isn't that heavy. Hold it with your left hand.

1341
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,800
- And Jin Hee...
 -  It's not so heavy.

1342
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,160
Keeps trying to hold us in check. It's pretty stressful.

1343
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,710
This is it. I think this weighs the same.

1344
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,800
- Theirs is heavier.
 -  Really?

1345
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,960
- Isn't ours more heavy?
 -  It's very confusing.

1346
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,160
Can we have a bite of our fruit?

1347
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,860
As long as it's not a quiz to guess the fruit,

1348
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,180
we'll allow you that until we start measuring its weight.

1349
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,160
Let's just have one bite.

1350
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,260
Do you want it?

1351
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,900
(Biting)

1352
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,330
Stop there. Give it to me.

1353
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,630
But don't we have to wash it before we eat?

1354
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,000
(Pink Team cuts it with a knife.)

1355
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,900
- Time is ticking. Please hurry.
 -  We should hurry up.

1356
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,030
Take two-thirds of it.

1357
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,360
- Two-thirds?
 -  Maybe one-third?

1358
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,540
- Okay. One-third.
 -  We'll take one-third.

1359
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,760
Okay. That's good.

1360
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,360
I think it's too light.

1361
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,260
It's too light.

1362
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,440
This is...

1363
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,700
This won't be enough.

1364
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,300
- Stop eating, Kwang Soo.
 -  Stop eating!

1365
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,600
Stop. It's too light now.

1366
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,960
(It's significantly smaller.)

1367
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,560
The total weight of the plate and dakgangjung is...

1368
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,760
820g.

1369
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,300
- Wow.
 -  I think ours is about that heavy.

1370
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,900
- Is it 820g?
 -  The total is 820g.

1371
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,460
- It doesn't look that heavy.
 -  We didn't have to do that earlier.

1372
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,630
Blue Team first.

1373
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,860
Please put your fruit on the scale.

1374
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,860
Stay still. Leave it as is.

1375
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,630
(It starts with 4.)

1376
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,870
Gosh.

1377
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,160
Take it back.

1378
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,700
(Kwang Soo is to blame.)

1379
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,130
(It starts with 4 for Pink Team too.)

1380
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,960
(What a shame.)

1381
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,100
(It's 4 again for Yellow Team.)

1382
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,730
(All of their numbers start with 4.)

1383
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,960
Let me announce the results. Blue Team's pear...

1384
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,800
weighs 472g.

1385
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,400
(Dakgangjung on a plate: 820g, Blue Team's pear: 472g)

1386
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,000
Why did you eat so much?

1387
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,630
I don't know.

1388
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,630
- Why would you even ask?
 -  Yellow Team's...

1389
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,540
Gosh.

1390
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,030
The melon weighs 488g.

1391
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,430
(Dakgangjung on a plate: 820g, Yellow Teams' pear: 488g)

1392
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,530
Pink Team's melon...

1393
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,430
weighs 498g.

1394
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,230
(Dakgangjung on a plate: 820g, Pink Team's melon: 498g)

1395
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,730
- Are we first?
 -  Yes, we are.

1396
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,060
- Are we really?
 -  Be quiet.

1397
00:53:58,730 --> 00:53:59,900
- This is heavier.
 -  Does this make sense to you?

1398
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,160
- Why did you eat so much?
 -  This is amazing.

1399
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,800
- Why on earth did you eat so much?
 -  You kept telling me to eat.

1400
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,500
- We did well.
 -  Currently,

1401
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,460
the scores are 3 points for Yellow, 4 for Pink and 2 for Blue.

1402
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,400
The last mission...

1403
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,560
- at the market...
 -  Let's make it up this time.

1404
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,830
- will determine the winner.
 -  Okay.

1405
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,030
(At this pace, )

1406
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,500
(they might fail the special agent mission...)

1407
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,460
(and end up revealing Agent Hee Ae's hint.)

1408
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,160
(Mrs Market Final Round)

1409
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,130
- I don't think we should eat.
 -  Here.

1410
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,230
(The food for the final round is mandu.)

1411
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,760
- Have a piece, Hee Ae.
 -  Thanks.

1412
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,060
- What could it be?
 -  I need some soy sauce.

1413
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,230
- What could we be doing?
 -  What are we supposed to do?

1414
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,260
- Enjoy.
 -  Give me some soy sauce.

1415
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,300
- We can't be weighing this.
 -  Should we guess what's inside?

1416
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,060
- I don't think it's about that.
 -  Is it something about soy sauce?

1417
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,600
- Usually, what goes inside is...
 -  This is just plain soy sauce.

1418
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,230
What we have to guess.

1419
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,130
Mostly, when you get mandu, you have to guess what's inside.

1420
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,060
(Can I really go on and eat?)

1421
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,830
Let's savour the taste.

1422
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,830
This is good.

1423
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,060
- It's salty.
 -  I don't think we have to guess...

1424
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,160
- the ingredients.
 -  I don't think so.

1425
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,760
It wouldn't be the weight.

1426
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,400
(Blue Team finished eating first.)

1427
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,430
It's really good.

1428
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,460
(Blue Team finished eating first.)

1429
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,460
It tastes really good.

1430
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,700
I think the soy sauce tastes good.

1431
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,700
First place goes to...

1432
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,930
Blue Team.

1433
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,300
(Blue Team is the winner.)

1434
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,560
(We won?)

1435
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,930
- Second place goes to Pink Team.
 -  The first to finish.

1436
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,460
And third place goes to Yellow Team.

1437
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,600
It's about finishing first.

1438
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,860
- What was it?
 -  The first to finish.

1439
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,560
You won because you finished eating first.

1440
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,730
(I knew it.)

1441
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,510
(It's a relief they were lucky.)

1442
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,000
Seok Jin left some on purpose.

1443
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,400
(Nothing works for Seok Jin.)

1444
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,860
This was unexpected.

1445
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,300
The overall winner of "Mrs Market" is...

1446
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,030
- Pink Team.
 -  Yes!

1447
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,030
(Pink Team is the winner of Mrs Market.)

1448
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,230
- We won?
 -  We did well.

1449
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,060
It's because the scores accumulate.

1450
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,430
That makes Blue Team come second.

1451
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,460
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

1452
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,930
(Haha's team comes second.)

1453
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,930
Thank you.

1454
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,600
(Fortunately, the hint about the agent remains unrevealed.)

1455
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,530
(5pm, SBS)

1456
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,730
Now, it's time for the final mission.

1457
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,410
(What is the final mission?)

1458
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,680
We'll win no matter what.

1459
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,730
The final mission is...

1460
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,230
(Whatever it may be, I won't miss the chance.)

1461
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,260
It's "Name Tag Elimination for Exchange Cards".

1462
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,330
(The final mission is name tag elimination for exchange cards.)

1463
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,200
It's "Name Tag Elimination for Exchange Cards".

1464
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,400
You all turned out to have equal number of cards.

1465
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,130
- Two each.
 -  Right?

1466
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,060
You'll be rewarded with three cards for this game.

1467
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,700
Look at Jin Hee's eyes.

1468
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,100
- Only the winner will be rewarded.
 -  I'm just tired.

1469
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,960
- They will have five in total.
 -  Oh, really?

1470
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,830
The winner will also get to choose the invigorating foods first.

1471
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,630
(The winner will have extra cards and choose the food first.)

1472
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,030
- What are you talking about?
 -  Why are you doubting things?

1473
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,160
Why are you speculating?

1474
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,600
- Why?
 -  You trust nothing.

1475
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,460
- Jin Hee doubts everything.
 -  He just guessed something amazing.

1476
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,230
- It gave us the chills.
 -  What is it?

1477
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,030
The title is...

1478
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,830
"Second to Last", right?

1479
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,400
Is it about getting the second place?

1480
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,900
Check it when it airs.

1481
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,960
Seriously. I think he may be right.

1482
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,460
We have one condition.

1483
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,630
- What is it?
 -  Only those who pass...

1484
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,960
the extra mission will be able to participate in the final game.

1485
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
What?

1486
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,700
All of you will go into separate rooms.

1487
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
You'll be given the same mission.

1488
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,530
I have no hope if it's about being clever.

1489
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,530
Is it about luck or brain?

1490
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,530
If you can't complete it within 30 minutes,

1491
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:16,730
you'll be disqualified completely.

1492
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,160
- Oh, I see.
 -  Really?

1493
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,830
- That sounds like fun.
 -  You can't even participate.

1494
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,200
I'm not good with these things.

1495
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,330
"Gary is disqualified."

1496
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,430
(This doesn't look easy.)

1497
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,460
- I understand.
 -  Cover your eyes.

1498
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,930
- Okay.
 -  You shouldn't see where you are.

1499
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,600
- I see.
 -  We have to be blindfolded.

1500
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,930
I'm worried.

1501
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,930
(They move to their designated rooms.)

1502
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,260
Can I take it off now?

1503
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,200
(The mysterious mission is revealed.)

1504
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,230
What is this?

1505
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,430
(The mysterious mission is revealed.)

1506
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,860
Oh no. Do I have to put them in the cups?

1507
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,430
Do I have to put them in?

1508
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,330
How do I do this?

1509
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
I won't be going out then.

1510
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,960
Be ready.

1511
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,960
(The extra mission starts.)

1512
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Okay.

1513
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
(It goes in.)

1514
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,630
(Jae Seok succeeds on first try.)

1515
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,930
(Bouncing)

1516
00:57:58,930 --> 00:57:59,930
It's in!

1517
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,030
(Gary succeeds.)

1518
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,060
I get it now.

1519
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,560
Everyone would get out.

1520
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,460
Oh no.

1521
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,330
No. I can't do it.

1522
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,330
Gosh.

1523
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,560
(Whatever)

1524
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,630
Oh no.

1525
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,760
(It's not so easy to handle.)

1526
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,130
This is frustrating.

1527
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,000
(Jae Seok is laid-back.)

1528
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,360
I should try to read the atmosphere.

1529
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,330
(It's in).

1530
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,930
I don't think getting out quickly is a good thing.

1531
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,900
(She aims for the cup in the middle.)

1532
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,130
(It goes in anyway.)

1533
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,530
What just happened?

1534
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,800
How did that end up there?

1535
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,460
(Jae Seok only needs to get one more in.)

1536
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,700
(It goes in.)

1537
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,330
Gosh.

1538
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,460
(He finishes first.)

1539
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
What do I do?

1540
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,260
Since you completed the mission, here is the rule.

1541
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,300
(Here is the rule.)

1542
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,900
I thought I could just leave.

1543
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,930
"Different mission"?

1544
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,160
(Be aware of the two people with a different mission.)

1545
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,300
They have a different mission?

1546
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,700
(Hints on those two have been revealed.)

1547
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,760
What?

1548
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,630
When were they revealed?

1549
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,360
You know them.

1550
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,230
They have a different mission?

1551
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,260
(He receives a pass to go into the building.)

1552
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,130
(Jae Seok escapes the room first.)

1553
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,160
What is going on?

1554
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,560
What other mission?

1555
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,230
Yu Jae Seok escapes the room.

1556
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,200
Yu Jae Seok escapes the room.

1557
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,700
He escaped already?

1558
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,760
Wow, Jae Seok is unbelievable.

1559
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,800
(The news got them nervous.)

1560
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
This is nerve-racking.

1561
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,260
(Kwang Soo of Blue Team...)

1562
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,260
Okay!

1563
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,460
(also succeeds.)

1564
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,460
Thank you.

1565
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,530
(He also gets the rule card and the pass.)

1566
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,300
"The two people with a different mission."

1567
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,950
(What does this mean?)

1568
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:44,960
Gosh.

1569
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,900
"Be aware of the two people that have been acting suspiciously."

1570
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,830
(Two people who have been acting suspiciously)

1571
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,400
It must be Jin Hee.

1572
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,760
For Kwang Soo.

1573
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,060
(Jin Hee is oblivious to everything.)

1574
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,130
Korean beef for Kwang Soo.

1575
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,160
Korean beef.

1576
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,400
That's it!

1577
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,830
(Haha of Blue Team...)

1578
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,830
(also completes the mission.)

1579
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,500
"The two people with a different mission."

1580
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,030
I knew it. This wasn't what's important.

1581
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,060
There are suspicious people.

1582
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,930
There are.

1583
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,800
(The two who have been deceiving everyone)

1584
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,830
(Who could they be?)

1585
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,100
What is this again?

1586
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,630
(Who could the two people be?)

1587
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,000
Oh gosh.

1588
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,360
(Startled)

1589
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,460
You scared me. Jae Seok.

1590
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,700
- You read the hint, right?
 -  Kwang Soo,

1591
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,760
there are two people with a different mission.

1592
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,200
Don't just rip anyone's name tag.

1593
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,260
Jin Hee is suspicious.

1594
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,800
Should I share this with you?

1595
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,890
What is it?

1596
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,860
(Tell me, what is it?)

1597
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,960
Today...

1598
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,900
While we were on missions...

1599
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,360
(While we were on missions today...)

1600
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,630
I noticed that the game titles...

1601
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,100
were related to Hee Ae's filmography.

1602
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,300
- Hee Ae's?
 -  Yes.

1603
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,330
- And?
 -  "Dae Jang Geum" is Jin Hee's work.

1604
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,500
You're right.

1605
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,030
Right? So I think it must be the two.

1606
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,430
(Is everything related to Hee Ae and Jin Hee today?)

1607
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,630
Kim Jong Kook escapes the room.

1608
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,500
None of my team has escaped. Where are Seok Jin and Ji Hyo?

1609
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,460
(Jong Kook has escaped, )

1610
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,060
(but others are still struggling.)

1611
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,130
Gosh.

1612
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,630
(Other team members are struggling.)

1613
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,500
Shoot.

1614
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,630
(Agent Hee Ae is still at it.)

1615
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:35,760
(It goes in.)

1616
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,760
Oh my gosh.

1617
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,530
(Hee Ae escapes the room.)

1618
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,600
Where should I head to?

1619
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,430
(Looking around)

1620
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,060
I can't find anything.

1621
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,000
Where do I go? You know, right?

1622
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,030
(Is she acting or what?)

1623
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,100
Tell me, please.

1624
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,170
Is no one out yet?

1625
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,430
Ji Jin Hee, Song Ji Hyo and Jee Seok Jin has escaped the room.

1626
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,930
(Everyone is out.)

1627
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,430
I just want to meet anyone.

1628
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:12,200
(I'm bored.)

1629
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,530
From what I see,

1630
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,730
setting up a different mission for the two...

1631
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,030
- must mean Hee Ae is one of them.
 -  Be careful.

1632
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,330
- Oh gosh.
 -  She scared me.

1633
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,960
I was just tying my shoe laces. Aren't you scared?

1634
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,200
Oh, you guys are on the same team.

1635
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,800
Did you just get that?

1636
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,830
Be careful. Don't wander around on your own.

1637
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,500
Please don't walk about by yourself.

1638
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,800
- Please.
 -  I'm serious.

1639
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,430
I don't know.

1640
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:37,630
- I was just happy to see you guys.
 -  You're out if we rip you.

1641
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,330
Hee Ae!

1642
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,630
Do I have to go over there?

1643
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,590
Gary!

1644
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,630
They're here. Jae Seok is here.

1645
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,630
(Team Yellow vs 2 members of Team Pink)

1646
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,160
- You two are here.
 -  Jae Seok.

1647
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,760
- Someone has different intentions.
 -  I know.

1648
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,230
Hee Ae,

1649
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,560
do you have a different motive?

1650
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,200
Me? I just came down here...

1651
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,700
because no one was up there.

1652
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,030
I was happy to see them, but they're running away for some reason.

1653
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,230
Is that so?

1654
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,100
I have no idea what the mission is.

1655
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,060
Is this a team game or an individual game?

1656
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,500
Right. Can you at least tell us the goal of the game?

1657
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,600
Is our goal to simply eliminate everyone?

1658
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,630
How am I supposed to know?

1659
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,600
Hee Ae, what's the spy's purpose?

1660
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,730
What are you talking about?

1661
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,000
What do we have to do?

1662
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,930
(My goal is for Haha to be the second from last to be eliminated.)

1663
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,230
- Hee Ae...
 -  It's not that difficult.

1664
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,260
Is just astonished to have...

1665
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,960
- Right?
 -  something like this take place.

1666
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,150
- That team is too strong.
 -  Excuse me.

1667
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,030
Jae Seok, don't you think that Blue Team is too strong?

1668
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:41,260
- I think they're very strong.
 -  We should eliminate at least one.

1669
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,960
- At least one of them.
 -  Right.

1670
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,120
- Look at him.
 -  Kwang Soo is running away.

1671
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,590
Can't you hand Kwang Soo over to us?

1672
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,600
Let's hand him over. We'll be eliminated if we don't.

1673
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,530
Okay. Okay. Kwang Soo is the most suspicious right now.

1674
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,930
- Before, Kwang Soo was...
 -  He was strange.

1675
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:00,750
- acting strange.
 -  I thought the same thing.

1676
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,730
He kept eating.

1677
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:09,060
(Sorry, Kwang Soo. Goodbye.)

1678
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,400
Are they going to eliminate me?

1679
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,330
You're going to eliminate me?

1680
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:16,280
(Running away)

1681
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,000
Wait, hold on. You guys must be crazy.

1682
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,800
- Why are you running away?
 -  You guys should be protecting me!

1683
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,360
- What are you doing?
 -  Why are you fleeing?

1684
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,230
- What are you guys doing?
 -  It's because you're running away.

1685
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,300
Aren't you guys going to help me?

1686
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,820
(They pretend not to notice.)

1687
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,360
What's my team doing?

1688
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,530
I got it.

1689
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,430
I ripped him.

1690
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,160
(I won't leave them alone.)

1691
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,860
- Why did you run away?
 -  Why would you flee?

1692
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,430
- Why'd you run away?
 -  You should've helped me!

1693
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,300
- Let me see your back.
 -  Why should you run? You have us.

1694
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,990
You shouldn't run away when you have us on your team.

1695
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,300
(There's nothing there.)

1696
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,730
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1697
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,200
Kwang Soo is out.

1698
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,260
You're not anything?

1699
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:06,130
I can't believe this. I'm bewildered, really.

1700
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,300
(I can't believe I was abandoned because I ate a pear.)

1701
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,460
(Among the three teams, )

1702
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,700
(Kwang Soo has been eliminated from Blue Team.)

1703
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,310
- Is that so?
 -  Why'd he run away so suddenly?

1704
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,360
I have no idea.

1705
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,860
Maybe he ran away and acted strangely on purpose.

1706
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,800
- Do you know why I'm spooked?
 -  Why?

1707
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,900
Because I think you might be the agent.

1708
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,770
- I'm so scared, really.
 -  Haha.

1709
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:33,160
- I feel like it might be him.
 -  I see what you mean.

1710
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,800
(If so, Haha easily gave Kwang Soo away.)

1711
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,260
I hope Blue Team loses!

1712
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,560
Jin Hee's a spy!

1713
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,450
- It might be Jin Hee.
 -  It's a possibility.

1714
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,620
Hold on.

1715
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,700
- Why are you touching my name tag?
 -  Be careful.

1716
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,200
- Why are you grabbing my name tag?
 -  She grabbed your shirt.

1717
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,200
- What's wrong with you?
 -  Gosh, I got scared.

1718
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,700
(The battle officially begins.)

1719
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,460
I'm scared. Guys, my arm hurts!

1720
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,910
(Stay away, my arm hurts!)

1721
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,100
I apologise.

1722
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,160
- I'm sorry.
 -  Be careful, Hee Ae.

1723
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,930
(Hee Ae lies down on the floor.)

1724
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,220
- Wait a minute.
 -  Hee Ae. Hee Ae.

1725
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,200
- Stop. Stop.
 -  Hee Ae's lying down.

1726
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,800
- She lied down.
 -  You have to get up now.

1727
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,160
- Would you like to stay down there?
 -  Hee Ae...

1728
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,500
- She lied down on purpose.
 -  Maybe she did.

1729
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,560
- Then stay there, Hee Ae.
 -  Go away.

1730
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,320
Hee Ae.

1731
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,430
- Hold on, Hee Ae.
 -  Are you shooting a movie?

1732
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,200
- You shouldn't stay there, Hee Ae.
 -  Are you?

1733
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,300
I'm scared.

1734
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,000
(Pink Team has become the new target.)

1735
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,700
(Jin Hee makes a sudden attack.)

1736
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,370
- Jin Hee has quick hands.
 -  Are we battling now?

1737
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,960
Gary, Jae Seok's grabbing your name tag right now.

1738
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,200
Jae Seok, why are you doing this?

1739
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,300
- We have to eliminate one of them.
 -  Go over there.

1740
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,400
That's right. Keep going straight.

1741
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,450
- Go straight. Good.
 -  That's good.

1742
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,440
- Great. We cornered them.
 -  That's great.

1743
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,700
- We made it.
 -  Stay still.

1744
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,400
Someone rip their name tags.

1745
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,790
It's okay. It's okay.

1746
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,900
- Hold on.
 -  We got it.

1747
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,630
Come inside. What are you guys doing?

1748
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,930
(Ripping)

1749
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,560
(As soon as Gary's eliminated, Jae Seok and Jin Hee battle.)

1750
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,630
- My goodness.
 -  They're battling.

1751
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:05,400
- Go for it.
 -  They're battling.

1752
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,500
- Spread out.
 -  Oh, gosh.

1753
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,400
(Goodness, I'm scared.)

1754
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,360
(Who ripped my tag?)

1755
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,530
Who is it?

1756
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,530
(Jae Seok is very competitive.)

1757
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,700
He's determined.

1758
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,940
- He has a strong will.
 -  Jae Seok is very determined.

1759
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,260
There's something going on. They might both be spies.

1760
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,630
(Hee Ae, I will protect you.)

1761
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,560
(Is Jae Seok Hee Ae's supporting agent?)

1762
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,090
Jae Seok, I think you're the one who ripped my name tag.

1763
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:31,130
What are you talking about?

1764
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,360
(Is Gary blowing his team's cover?)

1765
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,530
You're right. You're right.

1766
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,300
(Jae Seok and Jin Hee...)

1767
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,730
(were both holding Gary's name tag.)

1768
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,240
(Did Jae Seok remove Gary's name tag amidst the chaos?)

1769
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,900
- You're right.
 -  Gary!

1770
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,960
I was trying to save you!

1771
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,500
Are you sure?

1772
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,830
(Jae Seok seems suspicious.)

1773
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,200
There's something strange. They might both be spies.

1774
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,960
There's something going on.

1775
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,630
(Gary is out from Pink Team.)

1776
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:02,300
(Who is the other special agent?)

1777
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,240
Gary, are you out?

1778
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,380
I think it's either Jin Hee or Hee Ae.

1779
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,230
Jae Seok was a bit strange toward the end.

1780
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,300
Is there a hint in the visitor's card?

1781
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,600
No way.

1782
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,560
It says it can't be handed over to Tiger.

1783
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,530
(Tiger?)

1784
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,630
(Tiger and special compliment?)

1785
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,230
(If there is a tiger among us, )

1786
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,600
(wouldn't it be Jong Kook?)

1787
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:41,630
(Hee Ae was given a secret mission this morning.)

1788
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,890
It's going to be hard.

1789
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,030
(Special agent Hee Ae felt great pressure with the secret mission.)

1790
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,400
That's why we designated...

1791
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,000
another secret agent.

1792
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,230
Who could that be?

1793
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,230
(Who will be the agent to help Hee Ae?)

1794
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:01,150
(A wide chest and bulky arms)

1795
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,500
Wow, it's Jong Kook!

1796
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,600
- Goodness.
 -  Hello.

1797
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,300
(Agent Jong Kook)

1798
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,300
(Goosebumps)

1799
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,430
I just got the chills.

1800
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,830
Who's the other one? Are both hints here?

1801
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,430
- It's "special compliment".
 -  Who's that?

1802
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:18,360
Do you not watch television?

1803
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,150
It's Hee Ae.

1804
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,230
Why is she "special compliment"?

1805
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,830
"Special compliment".

1806
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,500
(Don't you know this catchphrase?)

1807
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,630
This hint wouldn't have been helpful to me anyway.

1808
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:32,060
I can't believe I'm out with someone like him. It's stifling.

1809
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,830
It's depressing, really.

1810
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,230
(I guess Hee Ae was a special woman.)

1811
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,060
(Will these two agents complete their mission without being caught?)

1812
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,800
(The three teams are once again face to face.)

1813
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,270
- Are they here?
 -  Okay.

1814
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:47,300
- Hee Ae stay out, you can get hurt.
 -  I'm hiding over here.

1815
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,820
I'm here.

1816
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,070
Is today's show going along properly?

1817
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:55,030
- I'm getting so suspicious.
 -  I agree.

1818
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,860
I'm questioning my own actions.

1819
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
- Hee Ae, get ready.
 -  Hee Ae...

1820
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,960
- Get ready, Hee Ae.
 -  hasn't been doing anything.

1821
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,830
- Be prepared.
 -  It's a great strategy.

1822
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,430
(Hee Ae hides behind a cameraman.)

1823
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,400
I'm dizzy. Let's turn in the opposite direction.

1824
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,500
(The official battle begins.)

1825
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,200
- Let's finish this quickly.
 -  All right.

1826
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,860
(Hee Ae grabs Ji Hyo.)

1827
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,630
(Hee Ae makes a surprise attack.)

1828
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:25,000
(Slipping)

1829
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,230
- Oh, gosh.
 -  My goodness.

1830
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,270
(Hee Ae attacks and runs away.)

1831
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,600
She attacks while being scared.

1832
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,630
It was a good try.

1833
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,990
- She's scary.
 -  She made a good effort.

1834
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,200
Seriously.

1835
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,770
(Gosh, it was close.)

1836
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,360
You guys are amazing.

1837
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,270
I'm so scared.

1838
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,560
(Jong Kook makes the first attack.)

1839
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,330
(Jin Hee's target is Ji Hyo.)

1840
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,630
(Jong Kook protects Haha while attacking Jae Seok.)

1841
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,730
(It's Ji Hyo vs Jin Hee.)

1842
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,030
Hey, watch out.

1843
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,960
(Seok Jin and Hee Ae join them.)

1844
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,290
- Hee Ae, you have to come now.
 -  Come in now.

1845
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,800
- Come here.
 -  Hurry.

1846
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,220
Wait a minute!

1847
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,720
- Come here now.
 -  Hurry.

1848
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,030
Wait a minute!

1849
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,770
- I got him.
 -  He's out.

1850
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,830
(Seok Jin of Yellow Team is out.)

1851
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,930
Okay. Okay. Get her now.

1852
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,230
(Jin Hee and Hee Ae go for Ji Hyo.)

1853
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:15,230
What do I do?

1854
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,830
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1855
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,130
(Jong Kook, we have to eliminate everyone but Haha.)

1856
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,860
(Okay, Hee Ae.)

1857
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,730
Hey, Haha!

1858
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,930
Haha, rip him!

1859
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:27,700
Rip his tag.

1860
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:29,330
Did you get ripped?

1861
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:31,160
(Haha grabs Jong Kook's name tag.)

1862
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,770
- Rip it.
 -  Did you get ripped?

1863
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,560
There we go!

1864
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,550
Good job.

1865
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,800
(Special agent Jong Kook is out.)

1866
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:45,800
(On the other hand, Jin Hee and Hee Ae...)

1867
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,500
(easily eliminate Ji Hyo.)

1868
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,530
Are you okay?

1869
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,100
What's going on?

1870
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,460
(Now, they just need to eliminate Jae Seok and Jin Hee.)

1871
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,030
(But at that moment, )

1872
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,330
(Jae Seok makes a surprise attack.)

1873
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:05,600
(Ripping)

1874
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,700
(Haha is out, thanks to Jae Seok.)

1875
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,730
Hey.

1876
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:15,930
(The final secret mission to make Haha come second has failed.)

1877
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:21,330
(Haha, why did you eliminate me?)

1878
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,230
Hee Ae.

1879
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,800
- Hee Ae.
 -  Are they all eliminated?

1880
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:27,530
- It's okay.
 -  Gosh, then I'm going to lose.

1881
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,930
What are you?

1882
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,400
It was you.

1883
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,600
(Let's just get as many invigorating foods as possible.)

1884
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,930
- Goodness.
 -  Hold on.

1885
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,130
- Hee Ae, go away.
 -  Come here!

1886
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,330
Stop it. Hee Ae, what are you doing?

1887
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,560
Please stop!

1888
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,960
You can't do this!

1889
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,360
Come on!

1890
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,200
Gosh!

1891
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,230
(Jin Hee's name tag is removed.)

1892
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,770
(They succeed in getting the invigorating foods.)

1893
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:57,240
Pink Team won. We'll give you three Exchange Cards.

1894
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,630
Great.

1895
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,450
It's all thanks to Hee Ae.

1896
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:03,950
Pink Team earned five invigorating foods.

1897
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,850
You can pick first.

1898
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,550
But...

1899
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,760
while you were playing the race for invigorating foods,

1900
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,860
you also had a special race for two golden badges...

1901
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,900
at the same time.

1902
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,200
Based on a specific drama,

1903
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,230
- we named it "Second to Last".
 -  Right!

1904
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,560
Jin Hee talked about it in the car.

1905
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,850
The eighth person who showed up...

1906
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,130
- It's you.
 -  was Haha.

1907
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:30,900
So the mission was to make Haha's team come second to last.

1908
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,000
(It was to make Blue Team come second to last.)

1909
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,930
Haha's team takes the second place.

1910
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:40,630
(Haha's team came second after the first mission.)

1911
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,630
Blue Team came second.

1912
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,100
Thank you.

1913
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,710
(Haha's team also came 2nd during the 2nd mission.)

1914
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,730
We got two Exchange Cards.

1915
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,990
As Haha's team came second again, so we didn't give you any hints.

1916
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:53,360
They were going to give you hints about us.

1917
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,700
But you succeeded the mission.

1918
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,830
- That's why they didn't give us...
 -  Did you intentionally do that?

1919
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,430
And in the final mission,

1920
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,460
Haha, who was the second to last,

1921
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,600
had to become the second last one to be out.

1922
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,230
That's why you didn't rip my name tag.

1923
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:10,400
So, you failed to complete your secret mission.

1924
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,600
- They failed.
 -  The winning team is Pink Team.

1925
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,330
- Yes!
 -  We made it!

1926
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,400
(Pink Team is the final winner.)

1927
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,060
Thank you very much for joining us today.

1928
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,400
Let's have a round of applause...

1929
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,380
for Hee Ae and Jin Hee.

1930
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,110
- Thank you!
 -  And we'll watch...

1931
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,530
your new drama.

1932
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,300
- We'll definitely watch it.
 -  It's a weekend drama.

1933
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,390
Thank you.

1934
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,430
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1935
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,030
- Goodbye.
 -  Thank you.

1936
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,460
(Thank you, Hee Ae and Jin Hee, for joining us on such a hot day.)

1937
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,770
They've been treating me quite awfully these days.

1938
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,230
I was going to get therapy.

1939
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,860
We're here to save you.

1940
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,490
(They have come to his rescue.)

1941
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,820
(Hong Jin Kyung, Seo Jang Hoon and Lee Ki Woo)

1942
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,730
I'll take revenge!

1943
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,500
Today's the day.

1944
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,830
We used to work together.

1945
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,930
(Let the tall ones prepare for battle.)

1946
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,800
Get out!

1947
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,590
(Their average height is 192cm. This will be immense.)

1948
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:06,230
(Will they be able to stop these giants?)

1949
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,630
(Kwang Soo's Revenge)
