1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,840
(A special vacation to escape the heat wave)

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,370
(They compete with each other both physically and mentally to win...)

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,110
(the "Changing Lyrics Project".)

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,940
(Seven judges including Han Hye Jin, Park Bo Young and Im Jin Mo!)

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,240
(A music concert on a summer night!)

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,170
(What performances will they show us tonight?)

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,280
(On a very hot summer day)

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,040
(In a village in Yangpyeong)

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,540
- Hello.
-  Hello, Kwang Soo.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,830
- You're here.
-  Hello, Kwang Soo.

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,590
You must be so hot now, Kwang Soo.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,430
I thought it's already autumn.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,740
He's a fashion leader.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,460
- Hello.
-  Hello, Gary.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,560
Gary dressed as if it's winter now.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
(Gary is in a black hooded sweatshirt.)

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,950
-You're ahead of the season.
-  It has fur inside.

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,190
Hello, Jong Kook.

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,040
- He changed his shirt.
-  Jong Kook is here.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
What season are we in now?

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,690
What is it?

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,090
What happened to you?

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,170
- She is dressed like a hunter.
-  A hunter?

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,460
- You look like a theme park worker.
-  You're right.

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,960
- Hello, everyone.
-  Hello.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,860
- She looks like a baby lion keeper.
-  She does.

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,360
You look like an animal trainer.

28
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,840
Everyone, it's your last shooting in July.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,660
We'll take some time to look back on your performance in July.

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,060
(It's time to evaluate how they did in July.)

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,090
No way.

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,160
- Wow!
-  Gosh.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,890
(A special guest joins them for the evaluation.)

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,030
- Wow.
-  Goodness.

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,590
- Hello.
-  Hello.

36
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,230
She is the queen of baseball.

37
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,760
She's the reporter, Kim Mi Na.

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,030
- Hello.
-  She's the queen of baseball.

39
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,090
How do you know her?

40
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,260
Of course, I know her. She hosts a sports show.

41
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,160
The one who's very tall?

42
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,730
- No way.
-  She's not the one?

43
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,130
(Are you talking about me?)

44
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,230
Hello, I'm a reporter Kim Mi Na of SBS Sports.

45
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,590
Hello.

46
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,830
It will be August soon,

47
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,960
so I came here to help you evaluate how you did during this month.

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,060
- I see.
-  I recognise her voice.

49
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,390
- Okay.
-  I like her voice.

50
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,690
We will evaluate your performances together today.

51
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,790
- Let's check out your report cards.
-  Report cards?

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,360
- That's not necessary.
-  Gosh.

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,830
- Report cards?
-  My goodness.

54
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,260
- Why did they make report cards?
-  My goodness.

55
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,990
You won't ask us to get our parents' signature, will you?

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Let's find out how many times you became the final winner.

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,600
- I don't think there'd be my name.
-  Is my name there?

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,960
- Wow. Did Ji Hyo win three times?
-  I didn't win once?

59
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,180
(The number of each member's final wins)

60
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,260
- Wow.
-  Ji Hyo!

61
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,600
- I didn't win once?
-  That's amazing.

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,150
- The team ace Ji Hyo...
-  Did she win that many times?

63
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,200
- I failed to get even one title.
-  It's Ji Hyo's Running Man now.

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,360
- Unbelievable.
-  That is right.

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,420
Team ace Ji Hyo takes first place with overwhelming number of wins.

66
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,130
She excelled in both team and couple missions.

67
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,430
However,

68
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,490
unlucky Kwang Soo is the only member...

69
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,960
who failed to win even once.

70
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,260
- That's right.
-  His column is empty.

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,660
- Were you even with us?
-  How is that possible?

72
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,390
Kwang Soo even failed to win in Kwang Soo's Revenge episode.

73
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,660
How could I fail to get a single win?

74
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,490
(He lost even in Kwang Soo's Revenge episode.)

75
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,840
How can it be possible?

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,860
Moving on, Running Man is famous for its Name Tag Elimination.

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,630
This can be considered big data.

78
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,030
(The number of times each member removed others' name tags.)

79
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,960
- Okay!
-  Look at my bar!

80
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,890
(Haha and Kwang Soo both ranked top.)

81
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,030
Kwang Soo, what on earth happened to you?

82
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,450
When did I eliminate that many times?

83
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,660
The members who removed the most name tags...

84
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,030
- are Haha and Kwang Soo.
-  Wow! We made it.

85
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,190
- Kwang Soo...
-  Is this really true?

86
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,360
Teamed up with Seo Jang Hoon, Hong Jin Kyung and Lee Gi Woo...

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,030
in Kwang Soo's Revenge episode.

88
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,260
- I'm more amazed at Haha's record.
-  Right.

89
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,460
He was good in Special Agent H episode.

90
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,960
He did great then. He even removed Jong Kook's name tag.

91
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,130
Considering that you both didn't earn many wins,

92
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,230
you let others remove your name tags as much as you removed others' tags.

93
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,560
You lost as much as you earned.

94
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,560
- I'm like a bottomless pit.
-  He allows others to take his.

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,390
While some removed name tags, others lost their name tags.

96
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,030
Seok Jin, Kwang Soo and Haha lost their name tags the most.

97
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,510
- Betrayal cross!
-  Betrayal cross!

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,390
Betrayers take others' tags as much as others take theirs.

99
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,960
Didn't they remove each other's name tags?

100
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
It's because we're too nice.

101
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,090
As they become others' target often, they're considered...

102
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,330
weak members and pretty fair game.

103
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,330
I felt offended when she said pretty fair game.

104
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,330
Her calm voice makes me upset even more.

105
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,860
I don't want to be considered weak.

106
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,730
- I just tried my best.
-  This is my second time meeting...

107
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,960
Mi Na, and I see why she's the queen.

108
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,660
She keeps her hair on one side.

109
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,560
Isn't it bad for your neck?

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,690
- It will stiffen your shoulder.
-  What are you talking about?

111
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,330
She might have a disc problem on this side.

112
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,530
It has to be divided evenly.

113
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,290
- Her hair isn't that heavy.
-  It will be all right.

114
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,290
She loves to tilt her head like this to look pretty.

115
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,160
I've never seen anyone with such hair since I saw it in fairy tales.

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,690
If she goes to a higher place and has longer hair,

117
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,990
she'll be Rapunzel.

118
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,050
(If she only had longer hair, she would've been Rapunzel.)

119
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,930
Now, let's take a look at the average survival hour graph.

120
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,130
They prepared so many graphs.

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
In this graph, it's found that Jae Seok's survival hour

122
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,960
is the longest, which is 12 minutes and 23 seconds.

123
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,930
You were alive for a long time.

124
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,820
Most members survived for about 10 minutes.

125
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,420
However, the graph declines abruptly on Kwang Soo's column.

126
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,830
Was I alive only for 3 minutes and 34 seconds in a month?

127
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,730
- That's very short.
-  Kwang Soo was alive...

128
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,830
- for 3 minutes and 34 seconds.
-  He's so ephemeral.

129
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,630
- What do you mean by that?
-  You were...

130
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,860
You barely survived for a minute per week.

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,030
No, he survived for about three minutes every week.

132
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,130
I couldn't do anything.

133
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,230
I hope Kwang Soo survives longer in August.

134
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,160
- Only three minutes?
-  Right.

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,690
- Now, we'll watch video clips...
-  Is there more?

136
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,760
- that were viewed the most.
-  Is there more to go?

137
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,530
- The number of views?
-  We have top three video clips.

138
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,460
Let's check out the video in third place.

139
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,830
(Top three Running Man video clips)

140
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,530
(A scene from The Best Couple's Trip episode.)

141
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,940
- I remember that.
-  Yes.

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,520
My Hyo Lyn!

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,690
- I miss my lady, Hyo Lyn.
-  Look at the screen.

144
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,690
What's wrong with your hands?

145
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,290
- I had to dance with her.
-  You two were dancing.

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,030
I can't stand watching them.

147
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,460
Look at his face.

148
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,660
Let's find out the top two clip.

149
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,630
It's Gyeong Ree's dance on the beach.

150
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,460
- Was that one viewed a lot?
-  Really?

151
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,060
- I remember that.
-  Oh, that dance.

152
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,090
- I knew it.
-  Is that what viewers like?

153
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,430
That's why they asked her to dance.

154
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,390
People just wanted to watch Gyeong Ree dancing.

155
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,090
Then, let's check which one had the most views.

156
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,790
- Which one is it?
-  I wonder what it is.

157
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,940
- Is it Gary again?
-  Right. I knew it.

158
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,390
(Gary and Hyo Lyn's dance ranked first.)

159
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,190
Was our dance that spectacular?

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,890
- Their dance was awesome.
-  Oh, that dance.

161
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,330
- I remember that.
-  That's it.

162
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,530
My goodness.

163
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,590
Gary actually plays important roles from time to time.

164
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,560
(He's still embarrassed.)

165
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,030
- What is it?
-  What are you doing?

166
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,090
What on earth are you doing?

167
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,170
He couldn't stand watching them dancing.

168
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,590
The title of the video clip must be...

169
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,160
"Jae Seok Stopping the Dance", right?

170
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,170
- What are you talking about?
-  It must be "Jae Seok Stopping..."

171
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,690
- Why do you take credit for that?
-  That must be my scene.

172
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,090
That's ridiculous.

173
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,690
It's "Jae Seok Stopping the Dance" because I'm at the centre.

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,350
That would've been impossible if it weren't Hyo Lyn.

175
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,930
It dominantly defeated other videos with about one million views.

176
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,160
Congratulations, Gary.

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,330
- Thank you.
-  She congratulated Gary.

178
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm happy although I failed to earn the final winner titles.

179
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,930
I don't think she meant it.

180
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,230
Not at all.

181
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,520
So, this is all for the July evaluation session.

182
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
As hard as you ran in July,

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,530
I hope you'll continue to do your best going forward as well.

184
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,360
- Thank you.
-  I'm Kim Mi Na.

185
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,890
Will you visit us every month, then?

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,230
- He's right.
-  "Will you visit us every month?"

187
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
I want to you see her every month.

188
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,030
This is how Jae Seok met his wife.

189
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,330
That's right. No, she's married.

190
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,060
- Gosh.
-  Really?

191
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,590
You really don't know who she is.

192
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,930
- Are you sad?
-  No.

193
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,290
(Thank you Mi Na for joining us.)

194
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,670
Are you leaving now?

195
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,390
Lastly,

196
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,030
we should talk about...

197
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,160
improvements we could make in the future.

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,410
Some said that there are too many betrayal and cheating...

199
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,760
although they sometimes make the programme fun.

200
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,360
- Oh, cheating.
-  There were many of them.

201
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,620
- So we made a bold decision.
-  What is it?

202
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,190
The Rio Olympic Games are being held now,

203
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,560
so we need to celebrate the Olympic spirit.

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,890
- For a month,
-  Without cheating?

205
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,690
We'll have a campaign against cheating and betrayal.

206
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,760
(Campaign against cheating and betrayal)

207
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,060
(Let's stamp out foul play and betrayal.)

208
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,530
- What is he talking about?
-  So for a month from today...

209
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,680
- Do you want us to die?
-  Actually,

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,550
no one wants to cheat or betray anyone,

211
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,760
however, to survive on this competitive show...

212
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,590
- It can't be helped.
-  What he's saying is accurate.

213
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,660
- If we don't, we'd be destroyed.
-  We would.

214
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,030
- All right?
-  Let's try not to cheat.

215
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,960
Aren't the results already determined?

216
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,630
For the next month,

217
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,260
we'll have a committee to ban cheating and betrayal.

218
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,760
- Really?
-  The committee members...

219
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,940
will keep you in check.

220
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,030
If...

221
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,860
you get more than three warnings by cheating or betraying this month...

222
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,500
and the committee points you out,

223
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,330
you'll be banned from participating in one episode of Running Man.

224
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,330
(Banned from participating in one episode)

225
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,060
- That's terrible.
-  Banned from participating?

226
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,790
Kwang Soo won't be on the show then.

227
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,260
Isn't that too cruel?

228
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,430
It's a very natural way to...

229
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,030
- let him go.
-  Wait a minute.

230
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,660
- Goodness.
-  You'll let me go?

231
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,260
- How could you fire me?
-  That's horrible.

232
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,030
That's a very complex way to let people go.

233
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,060
Please talk to them.

234
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,130
- That's how it's going to go.
-  Poor Kwang Soo.

235
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,130
I know.

236
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,110
- Isn't the result obvious?
-  It makes sense.

237
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,580
Gosh.

238
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,370
Based on the purpose of today's race, we'll divide you into teams.

239
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,430
Therefore,

240
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,730
we'll divide you into Team Singers...

241
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,640
and Team Non-singers.

242
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,530
Jong Kook,

243
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,640
Gary, Haha,

244
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
and Seok Jin are Team Singers.

245
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,130
Why Seok Jin?

246
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,590
- Is Seok Jin considered a singer?
-  Isn't that ambiguous?

247
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,630
It's been over 20 years since he released an album.

248
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,730
- Seok Jin is not a singer.
-  Yes, I am.

249
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,460
- He's not really a singer.
-  How is he a singer?

250
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,150
- Of course, I am.
-  He's a less experienced comedian.

251
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,530
How is he on my team?

252
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,890
I released an official album with eight tracks.

253
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,490
The remaining three...

254
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,440
are Team Non-singers.

255
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,430
Team Non-singers needs one more person.

256
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,790
We invited someone to fill...

257
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,160
the empty spot.

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
(A special guest is here for Team Non-singers.)

259
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,060
(Who's the special guest...)

260
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,160
(who will save Team Non-singers?)

261
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,160
- Goodness.
-  He's a real singer.

262
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,660
- Of course he is.
-  Gosh.

263
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,060
(Yoon Jong Shin)

264
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,860
(Running Man members, I'm here.)

265
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,530
(They're reluctant to welcome him.)

266
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,570
Is Jong Shin the only one who came today?

267
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,560
- Gosh.
-  No way.

268
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,120
Reporter Kim Mi Na left,

269
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
but why is Jong Shin here?

270
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,470
Jong Shin reminds me...

271
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,860
of Baek Il Seob quite a lot.

272
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,890
(He reminds me of Baek Il Seob.)

273
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,030
How could you say...

274
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,030
"quite a lot"?

275
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,960
He's gained a bit of weight.

276
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,660
You've become quite an old man.

277
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,050
I can't distinguish between...

278
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,030
you and Seok Jin if you have your sunglasses on.

279
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,430
He's a singer and producer.

280
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,060
He's the president of a large entertainment agency.

281
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,100
He's the head.

282
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,460
- Head?
-  Yes, the head.

283
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,430
Do you mean you'll drown me?

284
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,460
We invited Jong Shin, the head of an entertainment agency.

285
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,460
He's the CEO.

286
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,530
We'll start "Changing Lyrics Project".

287
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,750
- Changing lyrics?
-  Changing lyrics?

288
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,730
(Changing Lyrics Project?)

289
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,130
- What's that?
-  Jong Shin has composed...

290
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,760
- He's composed many.
-  Many popular songs.

291
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,130
With Jong Shin's songs,

292
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,260
we'll change the lyrics and compete.

293
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,760
That's the race for today.

294
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,630
I'm not happy with competing with non-singers.

295
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,860
- Jong Shin is on my team.
-  Jong Shin is a singer.

296
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,590
- That doesn't make a difference.
-  Why are you unhappy?

297
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,830
Most of them have voices that are louder than yours.

298
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,560
Do you know that? I'm sorry.

299
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,350
I still can't look at Jong Kook in the eyes.

300
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,040
There are words...

301
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,000
you must insert into the lyrics.

302
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,550
- Do we have to earn them?
-  Yes.

303
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,560
We have to insert them into the lyrics?

304
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,690
You must change the lyrics by adding the specific words...

305
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,030
that we give you.

306
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,760
Here are the criterion for evaluation.

307
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,290
There's 15 points for how well you change the lyrics,

308
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,890
and as you'll be performing, there's five points for performance.

309
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,160
- Five points?
-  Evaluating the change of lyrics...

310
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,110
will not only be based on what the audience thinks,

311
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,260
but it'll also be based on what seven celebrities think.

312
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Celebrities?

313
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,610
(A celebrity evaluation group?)

314
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,030
The celebrity evaluation group includes...

315
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,660
actress Han Hye Jin.

316
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,090
- Really?
-  Actress Park Bo Young.

317
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,490
Lyricist Kim Ea Na.

318
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,990
Webtoon cartoonist Jo Seok.

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,660
DJ Song Eun I.

320
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,300
Music critic Im Jin Mo.

321
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,130
- Im Jin Mo?
-  We even have Jin Mo?

322
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,530
- This sounds difficult.
-  He represents music critics.

323
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,150
Lastly, we have anchor Bae Sung Jae.

324
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,260
We certainly have an award for the winner.

325
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,850
We'll give you Golden Musical Badge...

326
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,860
as an award.

327
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,490
As an additional award,

328
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,030
we'll give you a lost item that was found during last recording.

329
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,960
- What is it?
-  We'll give you...

330
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,760
two Golden Musical Badge...

331
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,490
and a Hungarian meal ticket.

332
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,560
- A Hungarian meal ticket?
-  Didn't he take it?

333
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,130
He received it last week but he left it behind.

334
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,420
Goodness, Jong Kook.

335
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,660
Why did you leave it?

336
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,030
Why did you do that?

337
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,060
You're not desperate at all.

338
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,730
Look at those messages.

339
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,690
Both teams will choose which song to sing.

340
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,260
- We selected four songs beforehand.
-  I want to sing "Patbingsu".

341
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,630
- It's definitely "Patbingsu".
-  I want to sing "Patbingsu".

342
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,030
- "Patbingsu".
-  I choose "Patbingsu".

343
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,360
- I definitely want to sing it.
-  "Patbingsu" is a good summer song.

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,460
- This is the first song.
-  This is it.

345
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,490
("Patbingsu")

346
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,260
- It's "Patbingsu".
-  Nice.

347
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,590
"Patbingsu" is one of the songs that represent summer.

348
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,130
Since Jong Shin releases many songs, we're always given one of his songs.

349
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,790
- I'm being serious.
-  It's a great song for the summer.

350
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,960
What are you talking about? It was organised beforehand.

351
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,860
- Did you hear what he said?
-  It was planned in detail.

352
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,160
"It was organised beforehand."

353
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,390
("Reincarnation")

354
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,760
It's "Reincarnation".

355
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,530
- "Reincarnation".
-  It's a different version.

356
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,260
It's from my fifth album in 1996.

357
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
("Reincarnation" was released in his fifth album in 1996.)

358
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,930
Isn't this originally a slow song?

359
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,090
- This is its reggae version.
-  I see.

360
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,890
Here's the next song.

361
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,060
("My Love Ugly")

362
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,130
It's "My Love Ugly".

363
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,930
- I see.
-  That's right.

364
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,230
- It was when Jong Kook debuted.
-  That's right.

365
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,260
The song was competing with Turbo's songs.

366
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,690
That's right. It was released when Turbo debuted.

367
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,860
Shouldn't Jong Shin be on "Immortal Songs" instead?

368
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
(Every song that plays was a hit song in Korea.)

369
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,890
He should be somewhere else.

370
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,230
His songs are famous enough to be on "Immortal Songs".

371
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,760
- It came out when I was 10.
-  I know.

372
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,860
- Here's the last song...
-  It was when he was 10?

373
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,150
We selected.

374
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,330
("Highway Romance")

375
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,370
- This is also a great song.
-  I see.

376
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,060
- It's "Highway Romance".
-  "Highway Romance".

377
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,360
- I like this song.
-  Didn't Jang Hoon make it popular?

378
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,630
- That's right.
-  I was more famous than him.

379
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,690
Didn't it become popular because of Kim Jang Hoon?

380
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,030
- Didn't he also sing it?
-  I let him...

381
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,390
have it to save his career.

382
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,760
- Open the windows
-  Hey.

383
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,630
- And shout
-  Isn't it Kim Jang Hoon's song?

384
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,240
It is Jang Hoon's song.

385
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
- No, it isn't.
-  Didn't he sing it while kicking?

386
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,860
We know of it as Kim Jang Hoon's song, but it's actually Jong Shin's.

387
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,230
- Did you or Jang Hoon sing it?
-  Jang Hoon sang the song.

388
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,960
- I sang this version.
-  Did he remake it?

389
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,430
Jang Hoon can't sing like that.

390
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,890
(He mimics Jang Hoon's singing.)

391
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,930
He sings like this.

392
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,060
I told you that Jong Shin gets lucky like this.

393
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,690
- Also...
-  He did with "Highway Romance".

394
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,290
Why do you keep saying that? I'm not a boxer.

395
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
It's either "Patbingsu" or "Highway Romance".

396
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,260
- I want to sing "Patbingsu".
-  Yes, you should choose one.

397
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,550
- I want either "Patbingsu"...
-  "Patbingsu" sounds good.

398
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,160
I like "Highway Romance".

399
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,160
I also like "Highway Romance".

400
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,660
- I agree.
-  Okay.

401
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,780
- It suits summer holiday season.
-  Right.

402
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,760
It's also a great song to listen to while driving.

403
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,940
That's true.

404
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,460
You'll sing "Highway Romance".

405
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,660
- Shall we?
-  Gosh.

406
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,360
- It might be moving.
-  All right.

407
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,460
(The war on "Changing Lyrics" officially starts.)

408
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,030
- Non-singers, come here.
-  Okay.

409
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,460
We can't cheat, but can't we have physical fights?

410
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,260
Physical fights are okay.

411
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,130
The committee will determine if you're cheating or not.

412
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,170
They're really over there.

413
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,530
(We're watching you.)

414
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,430
(Why are you scaring us?)

415
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,860
For today's "Changing Lyrics Project",

416
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,760
there's an item that may help you. The winner of the game will get it.

417
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,860
(An item?)

418
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,930
What kind of item?

419
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,660
What? Is it an intro?

420
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,250
It's a great song.

421
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,860
(Why do we hear music instead of seeing an item?)

422
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,830
- Isn't that Kim Kyung Ho?
-  It's Kim Kyung Ho.

423
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,500
- Goodness.
-  What?

424
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,350
- It's Kim Kyung Ho.
-  Oh, my.

425
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,630
- He's the item?
-  No way.

426
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,090
I thought he was Kim Hyun Jung.

427
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,760
- What's going on?
-  Kyung Ho.

428
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,860
I didn't know it was Kyung Ho.

429
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,760
- I can't believe it.
-  Are you the item?

430
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,860
Kyung Ho.

431
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,460
- Are we having a pool party?
-  Is he going to sing?

432
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,730
(This is it!)

433
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,760
("People Who Make Me Sad" by Kim Kyung Ho)

434
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,750
Is this some kind of a party?

435
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,960
His voice is great for singing "Highway Romance".

436
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,660
- Really?
-  That's true.

437
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,490
That's awesome.

438
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,490
The item is a singer.

439
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,660
(Kim Kyung Ho is a great item everyone wants to have.)

440
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,140
He's a great item.

441
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,200
Let's play the game.

442
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,130
(Can't I be someone like him)

443
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,890
(To you)

444
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,490
(Everyone is hypnotised by him.)

445
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,390
(I love you, Kyung Ho.)

446
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,260
Stop it already.

447
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,590
(He sings in vibrato.)

448
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
(I want to run)

449
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
(I wish)

450
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,590
(I could tell him)

451
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,430
(This)

452
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,890
(I give you my everything, Kyung Ho.)

453
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,630
(To me)

454
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,890
(She's my everything in life)

455
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,040
Thank you.

456
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,260
(Kim Kyung Ho is the best item.)

457
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
Kyung Ho.

458
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,660
Team Non-singers...

459
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,850
gets to choose an item first.

460
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,860
- We should choose Kyung Ho.
-  Here's the next item.

461
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,590
- What did he say?
-  There's another one?

462
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,390
- It's "Mad".
-  What's this?

463
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,560
Everyone, turn it in circles.

464
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,890
(Turn it in circles!)

465
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,530
(She's here.)

466
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,630
Everyone, turn...

467
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,660
your finger in circles.

468
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,290
(Mad)

469
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,530
- Mad
-  Nice.

470
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
(Everyone's into her song.)

471
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,700
(Bada, the human megaphone)

472
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,830
(Pointing)

473
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,530
(Water gun is cast into the water.)

474
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,030
(Do you trust me?)

475
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,360
(Yes, we do.)

476
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,090
("Summer Time" by Bada)

477
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,890
(I want her on my team.)

478
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,530
(Dancing)

479
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,290
(The second candidate is also desirable.)

480
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,730
- Hello.
-  Hello.

481
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,260
You're great.

482
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,360
I guess we get to choose whoever they didn't choose.

483
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,530
Everyone.

484
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Your items are Kyung Ho and Bada.

485
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,800
- They are both appealing.
-  I know. I want them both.

486
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,060
- We are satisfied either way.
-  Who should we choose?

487
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,760
- I like both of them.
-  Seok Jin.

488
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,510
- I know.
-  We do like both of them.

489
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm a good swimmer.

490
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,090
How have you been, Seok Jin?

491
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,060
(Who will Team Non-singers choose?)

492
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,290
- In 3, 2, 1... Kim Kyung Ho.
-  Kim Kyung Ho.

493
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,430
(Kim Kyung Ho)

494
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,700
- Kyung Ho joins Team Non-singers,
-  Yes. Bada!

495
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,930
- and Bada will join Team Singers.
-  Mad.

496
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,630
(Team Singers and Team Non-singers are assigned.)

497
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,160
(They are holding hands.)

498
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,890
I'm so uncomfortable right now.

499
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,360
- Why?
-  I'm so...

500
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,120
- It's my first time seeing her.
-  Really?

501
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,760
- Do you really have to do this?
-  It's all right.

502
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,830
- It's all fine.
-  Is it?

503
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,160
(I don't want to let go of this hand.)

504
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,290
- Even I'm getting uncomfortable.
-  It'll be fine.

505
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,790
(Hula hoops are hanging over the pool. )

506
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,160
What is this? Do we have to get through these?

507
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,060
Are we watching a dolphin show?

508
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,960
What if they light a fire on it?

509
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,540
- Please, don't.
-  We aren't animals doing tricks.

510
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,060
(You should've expected this much. This is Running Man.)

511
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,060
The first game is "Toss Them In".

512
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,490
We'll have to hold up someone.

513
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,990
I knew this would happen.

514
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,160
- Let me explain.
-  Is this even possible?

515
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,390
- Choose one person among your team,
-  And you'll throw them in the air.

516
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,890
And pass the person through the hoops.

517
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,240
Whoever gets to the finish line first will win this game.

518
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,490
- An item will be given as an award.
-  We'll have to throw...

519
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,060
and the person will have to jump too.

520
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,830
We'll reveal the item first.

521
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,930
- Are they going to show us now?
-  There's another item?

522
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,230
You'll have to win the game first.

523
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,450
- What's happening?
-  What music is this?

524
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,230
- Are they men?
-  I guess he's not a fashion expert.

525
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,200
- I can't see his face.
-  They have poor sense of style.

526
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,560
(Who would they be?)

527
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,090
They have poor sense of style.

528
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,260
- Who are they?
-  It's Yoo Byung Jae.

529
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,290
Cho Jung Chi.

530
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,490
(Oh my.)

531
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,790
- It's Byung Jae and Jung Chi.
-  It's Byung Jae and Jung Chi.

532
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,930
- It's Jung Chi.
-  Jung Chi works for Jong Shin.

533
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,990
Did Jong Shin recommend him?

534
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,490
Jong Shin must've recommended him.

535
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,540
Did Jong Shin pay you to get him on the show?

536
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,160
- Why are you here, really?
-  Is your company facing crisis?

537
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,560
Your company must be facing crisis.

538
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,140
I paid for this water.

539
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,560
I paid for everything today.

540
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,020
- He says he paid to be on the show.
-  Jong Shin, don't be like that.

541
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,360
So do we have to play this game to take one of them?

542
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,590
I think the least two popular people...

543
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,000
from each company are here.

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
The least popular at YG,

545
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,030
and the least popular at Mystic 89.

546
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,410
Goodness.

547
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,530
- I respect you all.
-  You look great.

548
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,060
- We missed you.
-  Hi, Byung Jae.

549
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,260
- Who should we choose?
-  Jung Chi, good to see you.

550
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,200
- Hi, Jung Chi.
-  Hello.

551
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,340
- Hello, Jung Chi.
-  Musically, Jung Chi is talented...

552
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,090
- You shaved your beard, Jung Chi.
-  Byung Jae is good for performance.

553
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,280
- I agree.
-  Yes, performance is his strength.

554
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,360
- He's a writer.
-  Yes.

555
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,860
- That's right.
-  He'd be full of ideas.

556
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,060
- That's right.
-  It's true.

557
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,450
- Right.
-  I know.

558
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,390
Jung Chi has a baby now. He'll work hard.

559
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,960
(I need to support my family.)

560
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,160
Please choose a person to pass through the hoops.

561
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,790
(I'm so happy.)

562
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,030
(She must be very happy.)

563
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,210
Aren't you a member of Dynamic Duo?

564
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,630
(A member of Dynamic Duo?)

565
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,160
No, I'm not. Wait a minute.

566
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,130
- No, I didn't mean to...
-  She asked me if I'm Dynamic Duo.

567
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,590
Please, stop.

568
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,560
She asked me why I didn't feature her album.

569
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,930
I said I hadn't heard about it. Then she asks me if I'm Gaeko.

570
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,290
- Really?
-  She asked me if I'm Gaeko.

571
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,730
- What are you talking about?
-  No, what I mean is that...

572
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,390
- Do you not know Gary?
-  Did you say Dynamic Duo?

573
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,860
- I meant to say Two Ssang.
-  She just said Two Ssang.

574
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,830
I worked with Gaeko recently and people asked me...

575
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,300
if he was the one who wrote erotic lyrics.

576
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,250
- People get confused.
-  How can it be confusing?

577
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,690
Erotic lyrics...

578
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,130
Please be fair and square. It's a single-round match.

579
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,730
- Of course.
-  Throw her first.

580
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,590
- Hey, Gaeko.
-  Just do well.

581
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,660
(Fine. I'll be Gaeko then.)

582
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,790
Get ready.

583
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,330
(It's Ji Hyo versus Bada.)

584
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,890
(The winner gets to choose first.)

585
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,030
(Diving)

586
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,640
(Bada kicks off fast.)

587
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
- Let's go.
-  We are on the track.

588
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,040
(Ji Hyo swims fast to keep up with her.)

589
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,430
- Jump.
-  That's right.

590
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,360
- Hurry.
-  Go. Pass through it.

591
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,060
(Bada passes the third hoop.)

592
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,390
You're doing well.

593
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,730
(Ji Hyo passes the third hoop.)

594
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,460
(Bada is indeed good at swimming.)

595
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,260
- They are so fast.
-  Just step on me.

596
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,300
- Go, go.
-  Let's get going.

597
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,450
- Just step on my hands.
-  Hurry.

598
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,290
- Hurry up.
-  Good job.

599
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,600
- That's right.
-  You're doing great.

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,490
- All right, Ji Hyo.
-  Good job.

601
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,460
We almost got them.

602
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,230
Seok Jin, get out of our way!

603
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,960
(Bada passes the fifth hoop.)

604
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,630
- Let's go.
-  Seok Jin, move.

605
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,690
(I don't care about the referee. I'm going to win.)

606
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,960
- Let's go.
-  Come on. Hurry.

607
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,960
Great job.

608
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,040
(Ji Hyo passes the fifth hoop.)

609
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,460
Be careful.

610
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,660
- Hold her.
-  Be careful not to fall down.

611
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,630
- Hold her.
-  Be careful.

612
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,230
(This is the last hoop.)

613
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,560
(We won't let that happen.)

614
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,230
No way.

615
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,290
(Grabbing)

616
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,460
(We knew they would play dirty.)

617
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,530
Pull her out.

618
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,590
(We'll drag you back to the other side of the hoop.)

619
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,360
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo each get a warning.)

620
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,330
(It's chaotic here.)

621
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,490
(Aren't I here to sing?)

622
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,100
Let her go.

623
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,330
Stop her.

624
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,390
(Ji Hyo won't miss this chance.)

625
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,190
(Even Ji Hyo is trying to cheat.)

626
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,160
I won't let you pass.

627
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,730
(We don't know the meaning of fair play.)

628
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,290
(Are they doing all that just for us?)

629
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,980
Tilt her body.

630
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,550
(Who will get through this chaos first?)

631
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,390
- No way.
-  We're almost there.

632
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,160
(They pass the hoop at the same time.)

633
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
(Bada is slightly ahead of Ji Hyo.)

634
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,630
Bada got through.

635
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,860
Bada got through.

636
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,130
- Are you guys all right?
-  Team Singer wins the game.

637
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,790
We won.

638
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,130
- Yoo Byung Jae.
-  Yoo Byung Jae.

639
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,260
(Thanks a lot.)

640
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,860
You guys are so slow.

641
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,180
- This game wasn't fit for me.
-  What?

642
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,110
Kyung Ho, I can't stand the scent of your shampoo.

643
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,660
- Was it his hair?
-  Yes, it's Kyung Ho's hair.

644
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,860
It was so sweet I almost fell asleep.

645
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,130
Kyung Ho, that was too much.

646
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,790
The scent reminds me of France.

647
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,620
This is hilarious.

648
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,130
- We are about to choose.
-  I think my mum uses that shampoo.

649
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,330
You guys are so indifferent. Show us something.

650
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,130
- He's right.
-  Show us something.

651
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,960
- We had to play a game.
-  Boast your charms.

652
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,520
Since I'm a writer, I know I can write good lyrics.

653
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,680
- What about you, Jung Chi?
-  He's also a good lyricist.

654
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,560
I wrote lyrics for 10 songs this month.

655
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,470
- Then he must be out of ideas.
-  Are there any popular songs?

656
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,090
(He must be out of ideas.)

657
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,860
We've reached a decision.

658
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,960
- Have you decided?
-  Yes.

659
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,060
(Between Jung Chi and Byung Jae, who will Team Singers choose?)

660
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,500
- Yoo Byung Jae.
-  Yoo Byung Jae.

661
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,740
Cho Jung Chi.

662
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,130
- Cho Jung Chi.
-  Cho Jung Chi.

663
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,360
(Byung Jae joins Team Singers and Jung Chi joins Team Non-singers.)

664
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,330
When it comes to music, Jung Chi is the right one.

665
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,160
Byung Jae is on our team now.

666
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,860
- What?
-  Byung Jae.

667
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,290
Hi, Byung Jae.

668
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,560
- He'll be really helpful.
-  Yes.

669
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,860
- We can see that he hates his team.
-  My shoulder hurts.

670
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,560
Look. He's sweating.

671
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,090
Byung Jae is...

672
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,960
one of my favourite people.

673
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,060
- Do you guys keep in touch?
-  No.

674
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,860
- Byung Jae, give me your number.
-  Yes, I will.

675
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,160
Jung Chi, you're not sick or anything, right?

676
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,430
Yes, I'm healthy.

677
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,160
What's wrong with your rash guard?

678
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,590
Your rash guard seems too big.

679
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,290
He makes it feel like we're here for medical treatments.

680
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,760
Don't say that.

681
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,480
- He's here to practise.
-  He's your employee.

682
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Don't put it that way. Stop teasing him.

683
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,830
The winner of this game will get to choose the order of performance.

684
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,590
- This is really important.
-  It's important.

685
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,760
- It is.
-  We must win.

686
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
Whoever sings last will have the advantage.

687
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,890
We'll compete with the same song.

688
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,390
This mission is called "The Battle of Flamingos".

689
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,160
"The Battle of Flamingos".

690
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,660
Here are floating swans and flamingos.

691
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,630
Hop on the tube and knock out the others.

692
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,940
Whoever survives until the end wins.

693
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,630
- It'll be a lot of fun.
-  Can we get physical?

694
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,230
Getting physical is only natural.

695
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,730
It should be allowed.

696
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,960
Is the rule same as the cavalry-battle game?

697
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,430
- The cavalry-battle game.
-  You are correct.

698
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,060
The losing team must include "The Battle of Flamingos" in lyrics.

699
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,560
How do we include "flamingos" in "Highway Romance"?

700
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,170
- It's a total mismatch.
-  It doesn't make any sense.

701
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,090
You'll have to incorporate it using your ideas.

702
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,230
("The Battle of Flamingos" starts.)

703
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,390
Jong Shin, knocking out Jong Kook is really important.

704
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,560
- I think this will do.
-  How about this?

705
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,590
(They can pick a weapon to attack.)

706
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,760
- You can go over and push.
-  I like this one.

707
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,830
If Jong Kook attacks you, you shouldn't fall down alone.

708
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,360
- What do I do then?
-  Try to take him down with you.

709
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,260
- Take him with you.
-  Sacrifice yourself.

710
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,690
Like Nongae.

711
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,490
(I won't let it happen.)

712
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,460
(The order of performance depends on this game.)

713
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,860
- Can I try this on you?
-  Yes.

714
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,730
- Goodness.
-  What do you think?

715
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,430
- Does it hurt?
-  Try hitting my palm.

716
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,060
(Punching)

717
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,160
(I'll fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee.)

718
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,290
- All right, let's go.
-  Let's go.

719
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,590
(Both teams enter the pool.)

720
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,830
(Six swans versus six flamingos)

721
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,460
- Is everyone ready?
-  Yes.

722
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,660
Get ready.

723
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,760
(We will win and get the right to choose the order of performance.)

724
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,190
(Who will be the winner between flamingos and swans?)

725
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,330
("The Battle of Flamingos" begins.)

726
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,660
(Who should I attack first?)

727
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,360
Come on, Kyung Ho.

728
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,260
It's too fast.

729
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,590
(They are about to clash.)

730
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,460
(The players are looking for their opportunities.)

731
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,260
(Who will be thrown into the water first today?)

732
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,230
- It's too fast.
-  I'm keep losing my balance.

733
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,070
My tube is going flat.

734
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,290
(What happened?)

735
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,630
- I'm doomed.
-  What are you doing?

736
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,290
- Please come out.
-  What is this?

737
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,930
(Meanwhile, Gary is approaching Jae Seok.)

738
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,060
Hey. Gary is behind you.

739
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,520
- Be careful.
-  I'm scared.

740
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,930
- I got him.
-  Wait a minute.

741
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,230
(Gary and Jong Kook surrounds Jae Seok.)

742
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,390
Jae Seok, watch out.

743
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,660
(Gary and Jong Kook surrounds Jae Seok.)

744
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,160
(I'm coming for you, Jae Seok.)

745
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,290
Jae Seok, watch out.

746
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,250
(Charge forward)

747
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,560
No. Seok Jin.

748
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,290
(Jong Shin seizes a good opportunity and attacks Jong Kook.)

749
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,970
Jong Shin. When you play against Jong Kook,

750
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,590
try to fall in together. Grab him when you fall down.

751
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,790
- I shouldn't aim to survive alone.
-  Exactly.

752
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,920
(Will he able to dive in with Jong Kook?)

753
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,120
(Jong Shin, Gary, Jae Seok, Jong Kook)

754
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,690
(Falling)

755
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,190
(Jong Shin falls and gets eliminated alone.)

756
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,490
(Jae Seok is still in danger.)

757
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,690
(Ji Hyo is on her way to assist Jae Seok.)

758
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,990
(Hitting)

759
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,960
Seok Jin.

760
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,890
(But...)

761
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,160
(the tube is flipped upside down.)

762
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,660
My tube is flat.

763
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,060
(What?)

764
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,190
(Is he still in the game?)

765
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,760
Grab this.

766
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Isn't he out?

767
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,350
(He hasn't touched the floor yet.)

768
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,150
- He is still in.
-  How come?

769
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,870
- Isn't he out?
-  No, he's not. He's still playing.

770
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,190
I'm not out yet.

771
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,760
- He's not out.
-  I'm not.

772
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,990
(Meanwhile, in the other side of the pool...)

773
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,390
What a great chance. I got this.

774
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,630
(Gary is our target.)

775
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,560
(Kwang Soo is holding something in his hand.)

776
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,030
(Gosh. They are scissors.)

777
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,790
(Kwang Soo punctures Gary's tube.)

778
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,130
He's out, isn't he?

779
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,890
(Goodbye, Gary.)

780
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,460
Hey, Ji Hyo.

781
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,560
My tube is going flat.

782
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,130
(What's going on there?)

783
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,030
(Referees couldn't catch Kwang Soo.)

784
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,830
(Laughing)

785
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,260
Look. Isn't he out?

786
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,630
(Ji Hyo is attacked by Gary.)

787
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,660
No, he is not out yet.

788
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,630
(Ji Hyo is out.)

789
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,890
Ji Hyo is out.

790
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,340
Dong Hoon. Haha.

791
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,690
- Please, rescue me.
-  Hang in there.

792
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,460
Please come and save me.

793
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,790
Hang in there, Gary.

794
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,830
Hurry.

795
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,660
(His tube is going flat.)

796
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,090
My tube is almost flat now.

797
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,260
Hurry up. Come and save me.

798
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,530
(Ripping)

799
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,260
(Kwang Soo continues ripping other tubes.)

800
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,230
(Kwang Soo the Scissorhands)

801
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,560
Why is my tube going flat?

802
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,160
What's going on?

803
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,090
(Kwang Soo hid his scissors under his gloves.)

804
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,630
(That's the reason why referees cannot catch him.)

805
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,330
(Kwang Soo is the master of cheating with six years of experience.)

806
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,730
(He continues to succeed in puncturing others' tubes.)

807
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,190
Why is my tube going flat?

808
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,630
What's going on?

809
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,590
- What is this?
-  Mine is going flat.

810
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,760
My tube is going flat.

811
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,630
- There's a hole here.
-  What is that in your hand?

812
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,230
Where is the head of my swan?

813
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,530
- Look at this.
-  He has scissors in his hand.

814
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,730
Look. Take a look at this.

815
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,660
(Who said you can use that?)

816
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,160
(They revenge Kwang Soo for his cheating.)

817
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
(Why are they fighting in the middle of the game?)

818
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,360
He cheated.

819
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,060
Kwang Soo made a hole on my tube.

820
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,690
(A cheater must be punished.)

821
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,890
(They are paying him back.)

822
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,750
Kwang Soo has a nail.

823
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,590
Why were you just watching?

824
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,460
Kwang Soo has a nail.

825
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,700
He has scissors in his right hand.

826
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,830
He has scissors.

827
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,660
Stop it. Wasn't that enough?

828
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,830
(Because of Kwang Soo, Haha, Seok Jin and Gary are out.)

829
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,660
Jae Seok. No.

830
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,790
(Jae Seok is still holding on.)

831
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,930
My tube is flat.

832
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,930
(Jae Seok is in danger.)

833
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,830
Referees. Isn't he out?

834
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,690
I'm not.

835
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,420
- Isn't he out?
-  No.

836
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,590
He's still in.

837
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,160
(Jae Seok is really tenacious.)

838
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,600
- He's still in.
-  Hang in there.

839
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,390
- I'm still in the game.
-  He's not out.

840
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,190
Jae Seok. Hang in there just a little longer.

841
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,790
- Hey. What are you doing?
-  Hey.

842
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,090
(Jong Kook makes a hole on Jae Seok's tube with his teeth.)

843
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,690
(That's monstrous strength.)

844
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
Hey. What are you doing?

845
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,430
Hang in there. Just hang in there.

846
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,590
Swim, Jae Seok. You can swim.

847
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,640
(Jae Seok hasn't touched the floor yet.)

848
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,160
- Isn't he out?
-  No, he isn't.

849
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,360
He hasn't touched the floor yet.

850
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,490
- No?
-  Yes. I knew that.

851
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,930
(Won't you go out? Please?)

852
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,410
Take Jong Kook with you.

853
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,490
Jae Seok, grab Jong Kook and fall in together.

854
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,490
I can't.

855
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,760
(While Jae Seok is trying hard to survive, )

856
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,790
(Bada and Byung Jae get eliminated one after another.)

857
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,560
Jae Seok, grab Jong Kook and fall in together.

858
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,630
- I can't do two things at once.
-  Jung Chi.

859
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,830
We need more.

860
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,290
- Block the hole. Block it.
-  Come this way.

861
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,790
You should puncture his tube.

862
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,130
(Jong Kook approaches Jung Chi, who is a weaker prey.)

863
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,190
(There you are.)

864
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,360
- Don't attack Jung Chi.
-  Stay away from Jong Kook.

865
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,730
- Be careful with your legs.
-  He is really scary.

866
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,930
(You can't run away from me.)

867
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,450
- He's like a shark.
-  Grab him and dive in together.

868
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,730
That's right.

869
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,160
- Jung Chi, grab him and dive in.
-  That's right.

870
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,890
(He looks as scary as a shark.)

871
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,060
- Let my legs go.
-  Jung Chi, grab him and dive.

872
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,190
- That's right.
-  Jung Chi.

873
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,530
- No. Jung Chi.
-  Flip the tube.

874
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,530
(Flipping)

875
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,330
(Jung Chi is out.)

876
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,390
Hey, Jae Seok.

877
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,230
- He is the only one.
-  What an easy target he is.

878
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,690
(I'm coming for you, Jae Seok.)

879
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,090
- It's Jong Kook.
-  You can win this fight, Jae Seok.

880
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,780
- He's scary.
-  He looks like a pirate ship.

881
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,330
(Jong Kook is about to ram Jae Seok.)

882
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,330
No. Jae Seok.

883
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,960
- There you are.
-  It's a shark.

884
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,330
(To catch or to be caught, that is the question.)

885
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,190
- He's coming for your head.
-  Poor Jae Seok.

886
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,790
- Jae Seok, grab Jong Kook.
-  Yes. That's right.

887
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,100
- He's out already.
-  No, he isn't.

888
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,480
(I wasn't hanging in there for nothing.)

889
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,410
(It isn't over until it's over.)

890
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,560
Use your teeth. Rip off the head of his tube.

891
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,610
- That's it.
-  Rip it off. Yes.

892
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,900
That's it.

893
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,730
(It must be easier to bite with his protruding mouth.)

894
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,130
(Can you stop biting, please?)

895
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,290
- It's all over, Jae Seok. Give up.
-  It's over.

896
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,290
- Rip it off with your teeth.
-  He needs Kwang Soo.

897
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,330
(I'm not giving up here.)

898
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,780
- He's so desperate.
-  A little bit more.

899
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,040
Use your canine.

900
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,060
Don't do that. He will bite your hand off.

901
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,760
(That flamingo must be really delicious.)

902
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,030
- It's almost...
-  Yes. That's it.

903
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,530
Pull him down. Pull him.

904
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,190
(Jae Seok strikes back.)

905
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,360
(Yes!)

906
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,630
(Did Jae Seok win? Then it must be the biggest upset in Running Man.)

907
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,730
What is going on?

908
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,790
(Did I finally beat Jong Kook?)

909
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,960
(He never stood a chance against Jong Kook.)

910
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,190
(After all those years of humiliation...)

911
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,630
(I fought, and I won.)

912
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,160
(You finally...)

913
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,530
(Hold on!)

914
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,230
He's not out.

915
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,790
(Jong Kook isn't out yet.)

916
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,100
(Replay)

917
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,600
(Jong Kook managed to hang onto the tube.)

918
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,860
(Jae Seok touched the floor first.)

919
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,030
I thought I won.

920
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,060
(Team Singers has won "The Battle of Flamingos".)

921
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,610
- I thought I won.
-  But you didn't.

922
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,890
- I thought it was over.
-  Didn't you expect that?

923
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,930
No, I didn't. I thought it was over.

924
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,460
- He didn't touch the ground.
-  Yes, that's right.

925
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,550
- He turned himself around.
-  Exactly.

926
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,970
You hung on to that for quite long.

927
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,790
I was holding on...

928
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,730
to this dead flamingo.

929
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,510
(Team Singers wins the Performance Order Card.)

930
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,830
I was really surprised...

931
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,020
- in the waiting room. Really.
-  Why?

932
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,290
- What was the matter?
-  I thought...

933
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,120
there was another female guest with us today.

934
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,220
Really. I'm not kidding.

935
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,290
I often get surprised.

936
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,630
Actually,

937
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,860
it has been 22 years since I last took a shower...

938
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,930
- in a public shower.
-  What?

939
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,830
- Really?
-  Yes, 22 years.

940
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,190
- Why?
-  There was an incident before.

941
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,960
- Yes, I remember it.
-  I was called outside...

942
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,230
from a public shower by the police because of my long hair.

943
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,660
After that, I never went to public showers even with my friends.

944
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,160
Today I did. It felt strange and embarrassing.

945
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,850
Byung Jae was stuck in the corner.

946
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,030
While we were taking a shower,

947
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,690
he was standing in the corner by himself and...

948
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,890
(Looking around)

949
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,760
- Why are you so shy?
-  What's the matter with you?

950
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,160
Why are you always stuck in the corner?

951
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,930
You shouldn't be sitting here. Can you change your seat with him?

952
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,890
- You must sit here today.
-  That looks good.

953
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,160
- It suits him better.
-  Stay next to Jong Kook.

954
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,560
Don't stay at the sides.

955
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,990
- Stay at the centre.
-  He should.

956
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,690
(I envy him.)

957
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,360
We're going to begin a war with words.

958
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,030
You will toss words to each other by playing games.

959
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,660
Toss us really difficult or really strange words.

960
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,360
We have to win a game to toss words, right?

961
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,260
- Yes.
-  And our sentences must make sense.

962
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,120
- Of course.
-  Let's see.

963
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,420
- It'll be evaluated by experts.
-  You will...

964
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,410
- "Sweating madly" looks great.
-  "Sweating madly".

965
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,660
They have "bamboo floor".

966
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,030
"Piranha" is hard to pronounce.

967
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,030
"Piranha" seems good.

968
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,030
"Piranha".

969
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,230
- "Piranha" is ours.
-  That's terrifying.

970
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,890
Jong Shin's jokes are like piranhas.

971
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,330
I'm never the first.

972
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,560
If someone's bleeding, I get closer.

973
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,230
If someone drops a bait,

974
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,260
he bites it.

975
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,430
- "My love, Soo Ae" is a title.
-  There won't be much left.

976
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,730
- What?
-  "My love, Soo Ae".

977
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,730
There's Su Ae.

978
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,800
They won't be able to use "My Love, Soo Ae" well.

979
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,660
We'll have to take it.

980
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,560
- Let's choose a unique one.
-  "My Love, Soo Ae" is far-fetched.

981
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,860
Jong Kook, you should do mosquito repellent.

982
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,110
- Or what about...
-  That's good.

983
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,460
We need to repel you.

984
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,030
- Do you want him to die?
-  Do you?

985
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,760
You've seem to have lost it since it's been a while since we met.

986
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,550
- What did you say?
-  What?

987
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,430
This game is called "10 Songs Challenge".

988
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,030
- That's great.
-  If you stop singing...

989
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,210
or if the lyrics are incorrect, you will receive a warning.

990
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,100
It's possible that only one person tries.

991
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
So we win if just one person gets it correct?

992
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,490
That's right. The person who knows the song should sing.

993
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,710
You will be warned if you get it wrong.

994
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,460
You'll be able to see part of the lyrics.

995
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,100
Let's go.

996
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,660
- Let's do this.
-  We can do it.

997
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,390
Let's sing "Emergency Room".

998
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,230
- "Emergency Room".
-  Number five!

999
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,730
(They're a great team.)

1000
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,030
It's related to summer.

1001
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,230
Summer.

1002
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,760
- This is...
-  It's about summer.

1003
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,190
- That's easy.
-  Is this a summer song?

1004
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,930
- My goodness.
-  Watch the pronunciation.

1005
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,860
- Okay.
-  I know the whole lyrics.

1006
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,920
(The lyrics are shown with blank spots.)

1007
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,530
- You need to go on the ice.
-  Get on it.

1008
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,760
- Go on it.
-  You need to go on.

1009
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,230
(He's frozen.)

1010
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,930
(It rids of the heat instantly.)

1011
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,930
- Gosh, it's cold.
-  You need to bear it.

1012
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,030
(I can't.)

1013
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,930
Put one foot at a time.

1014
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,390
(I'll dance the pain off.)

1015
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,430
The prelude is so long.

1016
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,390
Stay a while longer.

1017
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,890
- A while longer.
-  I can't.

1018
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,530
- In 1, 2, 3 and 4.
-  In 1, 2, 3 and 4.

1019
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,490
When you feel gloomy.

1020
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,530
Go up to the mountain and shout.

1021
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,360
Like me, like me

1022
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,830
(1st warning)

1023
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,260
Kung ddari sha bah rah bah bah bah.

1024
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,430
- Anyone
-  Happiness.

1025
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,030
(They get it wrong.)

1026
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,830
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, )

1027
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,360
(joy and sorrow are exchanged.)

1028
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,230
- He got it wrong.
-  Isn't it "Anyone could feel"?

1029
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,590
- Anyone could feel
-  That it doesn't go their way.

1030
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,730
- That it doesn't go their way
-  Then like me.

1031
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,030
(Halting)

1032
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,930
(I'm getting confused.)

1033
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,530
I know it but I forgot.

1034
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,930
It's easy to forget.

1035
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,160
- It is.
-  It's too hard.

1036
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,830
It would be amazing if they chose "Patbingsu" by Jong Shin.

1037
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,260
I need to see the lyrics to sing it.

1038
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,860
I can't sing without the lyrics.

1039
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,580
Singers my age can't sing without the lyrics.

1040
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,230
- My feet hurt.
-  Gary picks well.

1041
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,530
- That's right. He's lucky.
-  My feet hurt.

1042
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,020
- It's number 10.
-  Anyways...

1043
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,130
- I know that song well.
-  It's "Eve's Warning".

1044
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,260
- I know it.
-  Really?

1045
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,990
- Are you sure?
-  Yes, I'm certain.

1046
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,690
- Don't sing it in the original key.
-  Not the original note?

1047
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,220
- Jump.
-  Pull it.

1048
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,290
(The song starts.)

1049
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,690
The prelude is really long.

1050
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,160
I want to skip it.

1051
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,280
You need to stay on it.

1052
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,630
I thought it out wrong.

1053
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,030
It's really long.

1054
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,560
(She needs to be on the ice.)

1055
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,730
- It's so cold.
-  Why did you go all the way there?

1056
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,630
- You avoid me again
-  Not yet.

1057
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,330
- In 1 and 2.
-  In 1, 2, 3 and 4.

1058
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,360
You avoid me again while thinking of other things.

1059
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,530
(It's a smooth start.)

1060
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,460
Never been.

1061
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,100
(She shuts her eyes tightly.)

1062
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,490
If you know my thoughts today.

1063
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,630
(She gets it wrong.)

1064
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,660
- It's not that.
-  It was written.

1065
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,620
- I tried not to look at it.
-  It was written on the board.

1066
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,130
- Is it your first time hearing it?
-  I tried not to look.

1067
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,730
- My goodness.
-  I memorised it.

1068
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,260
Are you insane?

1069
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,100
You're so mad.

1070
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,460
I tried not to look at it.

1071
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,600
I thought I had memorised it so I had my eyes closed.

1072
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,730
You've failed.

1073
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm sorry.

1074
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,390
- It's not as easy as you think.
-  It's difficult.

1075
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,600
- It's difficult.
-  Number one.

1076
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,660
- Isn't it "Patbingsu"?
-  It's "Patbingsu".

1077
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,990
- I know this one.
-  Great.

1078
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,430
I know this completely.

1079
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,830
Can't I sing it?

1080
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,660
- Byung Jae.
-  Byung Jae.

1081
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,910
- You can't see it.
-  It's too cold.

1082
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,600
(He slips on the ice.)

1083
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,960
- He fails if he slips off.
-  Yes.

1084
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,930
(Is he frozen?)

1085
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,430
The intro is really important.

1086
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,730
(The beginning is important.)

1087
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,830
It hasn't started yet.

1088
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,500
Wow, it's summer.

1089
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,890
- Byung Jae, good luck!
-  It's really long.

1090
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,830
It's a party.

1091
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,230
(The prelude is really long.)

1092
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,530
(But my feet are experiencing winter.)

1093
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,100
- I don't need to do that part.
-  It's winter.

1094
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,960
It's summer time.

1095
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,600
What is this?

1096
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,820
- What?
-  In this summer.

1097
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,660
(He has no boundaries in range.)

1098
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,760
I'm just home alone

1099
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,930
I can't

1100
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,860
- I'll just have
-  It's cold.

1101
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,730
- To break up with you
-  Great.

1102
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,200
The tears that you shed.

1103
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,960
- He got it wrong.
-  It was difficult for me too.

1104
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,690
(He fails.)

1105
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,630
- It's difficult.
-  Don't go up on it.

1106
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,500
This is stressful.

1107
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,710
- It's harder than I thought.
-  No one completes it.

1108
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,730
(The prelude was longer than the time he sang.)

1109
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,430
I'm getting very stressed.

1110
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,510
I want to go to a karaoke!

1111
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,520
We'll give you two warnings from now on.

1112
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,560
We will give you...

1113
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,830
- Okay.
-  One more chance.

1114
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,530
Let's pick a song we know.

1115
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,560
- It's number 2.
-  Number 2.

1116
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,860
I know this one!

1117
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,090
Do you know this?

1118
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,230
- Let's sing it together.
-  You need to go on the ice.

1119
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,760
(Striding)

1120
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,730
- Go on it.
-  Step on top of it.

1121
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,530
- You need to go on top.
-  I can't do the rap.

1122
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,530
Past summer.

1123
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,930
(He feels the cold.)

1124
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,490
(They're a perfect team.)

1125
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,630
- He seems cold.
-  He won't make it.

1126
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,030
(I'm a professional karaoke singer.)

1127
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,430
Kwang Soo, isn't it cold?

1128
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,020
In 1, 2, 3 and 4.

1129
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,630
Past summer.

1130
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,090
The girl I met at the beach.

1131
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,590
Had long, dark hair.

1132
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,030
There was no need to ponder

1133
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,930
I just fell in love.

1134
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,700
I fell in love.

1135
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,330
(See?)

1136
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,430
- Where?
-  I met her.

1137
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,560
- The beautiful girl
-  You didn't know.

1138
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,930
I can't believe it.

1139
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,030
- She is so beautiful
-  You can't meet her.

1140
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,910
- I was so lucky
-  Isn't it "I can't meet her"?

1141
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,830
- You got it wrong.
-  You're incorrect.

1142
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,190
- The starry beach
-  They said "sketch book".

1143
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,790
Sing it instead of me.

1144
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,390
(They receive their 1st warning.)

1145
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,290
(Jae Seok takes Kwang Soo's spot.)

1146
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,490
It's prelude.

1147
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,080
(It's the prelude as soon as he steps in.)

1148
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,090
You should have picked this.

1149
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,460
After winter.

1150
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,290
(They receive their 2nd warning.)

1151
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,560
Please come back and save me.

1152
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,690
(They fail.)

1153
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,030
(That's a shame.)

1154
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,910
- It's not easy.
-  Jae Seok.

1155
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,300
- Like a crazy person
-  It's too difficult.

1156
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,190
- It's number 4.
-  Number 4.

1157
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,890
- Okay.
-  Number four.

1158
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,100
- We only have one left.
-  "In Summer".

1159
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,030
- Haha.
-  I know this one.

1160
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,630
It's Deux.

1161
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,060
It's Deux. Let's sing what we know.

1162
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,560
(Singing)

1163
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,530
(He looks at ease.)

1164
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,630
Deux.

1165
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:53,930
(He's full of confidence.)

1166
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,630
- Story
-  Looking at you.

1167
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,630
(He tries to distract them.)

1168
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,390
I know it.

1169
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:59,930
(They're determined to win.)

1170
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,030
I'll sing the parts I know.

1171
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,030
People who know the song, keep singing it.

1172
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,030
Get ready.

1173
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,410
The moment I've been dreaming of.

1174
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,230
- Here
-  Is unfolding here.

1175
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,130
(They receive their 1st warning.)

1176
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,830
My heart towards you.

1177
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,830
You accepted it.

1178
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,690
(Bada says the lyrics in advance...)

1179
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,530
(and Jong Kook sings it.)

1180
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,330
(They're a great team.)

1181
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,800
- Cool breeze
-  Cool breeze.

1182
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,510
- Comes to me
-  I feel

1183
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,010
- I feel
-  Happiness.

1184
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,390
- Happiness
-  We did it!

1185
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,850
(They only have the refrain left.)

1186
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,460
- We're here
-  The sky.

1187
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,630
The sky is open.

1188
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,230
- Listen carefully.
-  Next to me.

1189
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,730
(He tries to spot any mistakes.)

1190
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,990
(It won't work.)

1191
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,760
- Listen carefully!
-  You stand.

1192
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,830
With a big smile.

1193
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,760
You're the blue ocean.

1194
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,230
(They pass!)

1195
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,230
(Long live Deux.)

1196
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,690
- Deux.
-  I don't know this song.

1197
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,430
- That's it.
-  Team Singers win.

1198
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,630
(Team Singers win "10 Songs Challenge".)

1199
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,640
You can choose three words.

1200
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,120
You can toss it to the other team.

1201
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,830
Pick "Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach".

1202
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,130
- This one.
-  "Chogyeguksu".

1203
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,820
- "Chogyeguksu".
-  "Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach".

1204
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,560
- "Chogyeguksu".
-  It's no good.

1205
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,490
- Can it go in?
-  How about "straw handbag"?

1206
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,360
"Straw handbag"? Let's go with that.

1207
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,060
- "Straw handbag"?
-  "Hyo Lyn".

1208
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,390
(He slyly joins in.)

1209
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,130
- This is difficult.
-  Get out.

1210
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,560
(Get out.)

1211
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,180
What are you doing here?

1212
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,590
"Kongguksu" looks good.

1213
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,560
- That sounds good.
-  "Kongguksu".

1214
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
It's boring.

1215
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,690
We can make good use of Kongguksu.

1216
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,600
- Try kongguksu in summer
-  Seok Jin.

1217
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,530
- It's only seven dollars
-  Seok Jin.

1218
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,090
(They're a great team.)

1219
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,830
It needs to be opposite.

1220
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,460
(I'm great at changing lyrics.)

1221
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,590
It's great.

1222
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,730
Do "the butterfly stroke".

1223
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,130
That's boring.

1224
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,430
Wait. If it goes with...

1225
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,190
It's funny if they say they do the butterfly stroke in kongguksu.

1226
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,930
The butterfly stroke is my star.

1227
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,930
That's right.

1228
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:12,110
(These are the words that they selected for each other.)

1229
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,290
The next stage will be...

1230
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,290
- tossing difficult words.
-  Great.

1231
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,730
So we'll do proverbs.

1232
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,930
- That's really difficult.
-  That's too hard.

1233
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,490
- That's really hard.
-  I don't know many.

1234
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,930
It will be limited to proverbs related to summer.

1235
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,360
The winning team selects a proverb to give to the losing team.

1236
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
The proverb should be added to the lyrics?

1237
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,930
Yes, the proverb has to be included in the lyrics.

1238
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,060
(How do we include proverbs in the lyrics?)

1239
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,330
The next game is called "Exploding Karaoke".

1240
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,030
- Is that right?
-  Will something explode?

1241
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,590
We'll give you a topic without playing the music.

1242
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,160
Then, you must at least sing four phrases, or one verse,

1243
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,430
of a song that's related to the topic.

1244
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,130
This is scary.

1245
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,790
In three minutes, it'll explode.

1246
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:49,860
- That's right.
-  We have to be careful.

1247
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,890
- Shall we start?
-  Hold it like this.

1248
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,310
We'll get started. The topic is...

1249
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,360
- food.
-  Food?

1250
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,560
- All right.
-  Songs that relate to food?

1251
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,460
- It's difficult.
-  Either the lyrics include food...

1252
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,790
- If food is included in the lyrics?
-  I don't know any.

1253
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,590
- I have so many on my mind.
-  Let's start.

1254
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,760
I'm afraid someone will sing the song I have in mind.

1255
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,560
Start.

1256
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,960
A woman who makes good kimchi bokkeumbap.

1257
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,490
- That was one song.
-  Woman.

1258
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,390
Bingsu.

1259
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,590
- Patbingsu
-  Oh, no. What should I sing?

1260
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,030
Don't melt.

1261
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,290
What should I sing?

1262
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,090
Yongyebaeksuk.

1263
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,930
- Yongyebaeksuk
-  I have no idea what to sing.

1264
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,130
- I have no idea what to sing.
-  Take it.

1265
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,430
- Wait a minute.
-  Take your time. You have time.

1266
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,490
- What should I sing?
-  You may run out of time.

1267
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,620
I haven't thought of any.

1268
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,450
- Give me a hint, please.
-  Americano.

1269
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,550
Oh, that's right.

1270
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,130
Americano.

1271
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,360
That startled me.

1272
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,630
(Goodness)

1273
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,590
- No, this can't happen.
-  What did you do?

1274
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,430
The time is almost up.

1275
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,160
I like Americano.

1276
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,760
Americano, syrup, syrup, syrup.

1277
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,060
Naengmyeon, naengmyeon.

1278
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,930
You might as well say kongguksu.

1279
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,560
That's true.

1280
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,630
Naengmyeon, naengmyeon.

1281
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,560
You are too cold.

1282
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,330
- Three minutes will be up.
-  It's.

1283
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,350
Very delicious.

1284
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,230
Naengmyeon, naengmyeon, naengmyeon.

1285
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,160
- She did it.
-  Ji Hyo is impressive.

1286
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,430
I haven't cooked for you once.

1287
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,730
That was amazing.

1288
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,730
The lyrics mention food.

1289
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,890
The topic is food.

1290
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,930
- Twelve legs of squid
-  Kwang Soo.

1291
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,230
What did you say?

1292
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,890
- What did you say?
-  I said squids!

1293
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,160
- What was the word?
-  It's "Squid Aliens".

1294
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,630
- He said squid.
-  Stop singing that song.

1295
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,890
- What's that?
-  A glass of Bellflower whiskey.

1296
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,530
- What's this song?
-  It's by Choi Baek Ho.

1297
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,790
You're right!

1298
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,390
- You have a minute and half.
-  We have enough time.

1299
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,290
My hand keeps going.

1300
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,460
- No way.
-  You can't sing that.

1301
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,730
- It counts.
-  No way.

1302
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,630
- It's a song from a commercial.
-  This doesn't count.

1303
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,660
It's okay as long as you don't say the brand.

1304
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,890
- Why doesn't this song count?
-  It doesn't count.

1305
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,430
Hurry up.

1306
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,490
About two minutes have passed.

1307
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,530
I'll hand it over when three minutes have pass.

1308
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,560
- Hey.
-  I can't come up with any.

1309
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,430
- When it's been 3 minutes...
-  Take it from him after 5 seconds.

1310
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,660
What if it explodes on me? Hurry up!

1311
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,490
- It might explode on you.
-  If.

1312
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,290
- There was no kimchi
-  If there was no kimchi.

1313
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,430
There it is.

1314
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,130
How will we eat rice?

1315
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,960
- Give it to me now.
-  Hurry.

1316
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,140
(Give it to me now.)

1317
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,660
Mother said she didn't like jajangmyeon.

1318
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,510
Take it now.

1319
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,830
- Hello, it's me
-  At least, I passed.

1320
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,160
It's "A Shot of Soju".

1321
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,560
He passed.

1322
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,550
(He sings.)

1323
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:44,360
"Bob" is not food.

1324
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,260
- You dropped the microphone.
-  Cuban sandwich.

1325
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,360
- Put it back on now.
-  Cuban sandwich.

1326
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,650
- Does that song work?
-  Cuban sandwich.

1327
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,180
(He switches to a song about sandwiches.)

1328
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,690
- Put the microphone back on.
-  I sang one.

1329
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,060
- It's Jong Shin's song.
-  Hey, hey.

1330
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,590
- It's Jong Shin's song.
-  Hey, hey.

1331
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,630
(Jung Chi is selected.)

1332
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:01,790
Hey, hey.

1333
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,360
- Did he lose?
-  No way.

1334
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,950
Isn't it one of your songs?

1335
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,890
Cuban sandwich.

1336
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,360
He sang a song we didn't know.

1337
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,390
He has a song called "Cuban sandwich".

1338
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,730
- That song doesn't count.
-  Wait.

1339
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,860
- Wait.
-  Why don't you listen to it...

1340
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,560
- starting now?
-  No way.

1341
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,660
- It doesn't count.
-  What?

1342
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,690
- Why should we listen to it?
-  Cuban, Cuban.

1343
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,380
- Look it up on music charts!
-  Stop singing.

1344
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,260
- You'll find it.
-  What are you doing?

1345
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,830
- Search it online.
-  What's your problem?

1346
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,590
Who composed the song?

1347
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,890
- The winning team is...
-  The song doesn't exist.

1348
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,490
Team Singers.

1349
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,330
(Team Singers wins "Exploding Karaoke".)

1350
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,540
You must be confused,

1351
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,060
but the order should have started again from the first person.

1352
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,630
Let's just continue.

1353
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,190
- It's a waste of time.
-  I do think...

1354
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,960
that's the right order.

1355
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,430
Let's start with Gary,

1356
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,460
and he'll start again after Ji Hyo finishes.

1357
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,660
Yes, that's fair.

1358
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,530
Here's the topic. Listen carefully.

1359
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,010
They'll give us a hard one.

1360
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,160
It's either location or name.

1361
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,630
- Gosh, all right.
-  Name of a person.

1362
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,790
Get ready, start.

1363
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:07,290
Seoul, Seoul, Seoul, a place I remember.

1364
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,990
How many people came to visit?

1365
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,060
Don't refuse.

1366
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,960
- He's singing his own song.
-  He has his own.

1367
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,390
- Good job.
-  Jae Seok has his own song.

1368
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,090
Everybody, come to Haeundae.

1369
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,960
("Busan Vacance" by Skull and Haha)

1370
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,350
(Singing)

1371
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,150
Everybody, come to Dongbaek Island.

1372
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,860
The lyrics include so many places. Haeundae, Dongbaek Island.

1373
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,800
- Crossing Jeolla Province
-  And Gyeongsang Province.

1374
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,830
His songs are always depressing.

1375
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,190
Ari, Ari, sseuri, sseuri.

1376
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,790
- Where's the place?
-  It's "Jeongseon Arirang".

1377
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,690
- Ari, Ari
-  He's right.

1378
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,960
- Hill
-  Hill.

1379
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,930
- Heeya, please look at me
-  What should I sing?

1380
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,160
- It's "Heeya".
-  It is.

1381
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,290
What should I do?

1382
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,860
Annie.

1383
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,290
- It's "Annie".
-  Do you know?

1384
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,290
All right, I'll sing this one.

1385
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,050
J, in passing wind.

1386
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,190
- He's safe.
-  All right.

1387
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,360
Can I sing this one?

1388
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,290
Let's run to a rough field.

1389
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,020
- Is it because of "field"?
-  Field.

1390
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,030
Field.

1391
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,960
(Field is not a location.)

1392
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,890
That doesn't work.

1393
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,560
That definitely doesn't count.

1394
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,620
- "Field" doesn't count.
-  "Field"?

1395
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,110
- Goodness.
-  Location?

1396
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,430
- Wait, I remember.
-  Southeast of Ulleung Island.

1397
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,060
Right, I remember now.

1398
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,410
Southeast.

1399
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,090
- Of Ulleung Island
-  It's "Dokdo is Our Land".

1400
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,010
It's a lonely island, a homeland for birds.

1401
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:37,820
When the boatman's singing fades.

1402
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,790
- What song is that?
-  Dongbaek Island where flowers grow.

1403
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,890
That's a great song.

1404
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,810
That was one.

1405
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,530
Yeosu night sea.

1406
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,590
- Hurry and give it to him.
-  Is it my turn?

1407
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,630
- Hurry up.
-  Give it to him now.

1408
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,880
Can you tell me a song?

1409
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,190
- Let's leave together
-  "The Blue Night of Jeju Island".

1410
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,730
Let's forget everything and go to Jeju Island

1411
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,130
- I said, I love you only
-  What's wrong with him?

1412
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,460
- "Only" isn't a name.
-  "Only".

1413
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,080
That doesn't count.

1414
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,260
- "Only" can be a name.
-  No, it can't.

1415
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,790
I know someone named Only!

1416
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,760
That doesn't work.

1417
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,220
- Which apartment does she live in?
-  In block 15!

1418
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,190
- Hurry up.
-  Why doesn't it count?

1419
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,690
- You don't have much time.
-  Hurry.

1420
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:23,190
- The explosion won't reach you.
-  S, E, O, U, L.

1421
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,630
S, E, O, U, L

1422
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,760
A small boy named Dong Hoon.

1423
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,630
Here you go.

1424
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,790
- Hurry up.
-  Ja Ok.

1425
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,490
- "The Honam Railroad in the Rain".
-  I was going to sing it.

1426
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,490
Sing it.

1427
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,190
(It's Jung Chi again.)

1428
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,560
You should've sung that.

1429
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,360
Both of them exploded near me.

1430
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,690
- All right.
-  Goodness.

1431
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,430
Why didn't you sing it?

1432
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,690
Team Singers wins.

1433
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,060
(Team Singers wins the second round.)

1434
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,760
Take a proverb.

1435
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,090
(Team Non-singers gets a proverb.)

1436
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:56,530
"Weak things united become strong."

1437
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:00,090
"When the season ends, mosquitoes start to disappear."

1438
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,160
(They've decided immediately.)

1439
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,890
- I've never heard of those.
-  What about mosquitoes?

1440
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,830
We can use that in the lyrics.

1441
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,790
Write down that proverb.

1442
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:15,660
(Team Non-singers gets the proverb about mosquitoes.)

1443
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,490
With the given words and proverb,

1444
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,230
you'll change the lyrics.

1445
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,260
- Really?
-  Get together.

1446
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,660
Let's do it.

1447
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,990
You can start.

1448
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,470
There are so many.

1449
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,730
We have to add 11 things.

1450
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,260
This is a good idea.

1451
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,430
Let's choose a topic.

1452
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,760
- Seobinggo is a location.
-  Vacation...

1453
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,390
Let's have Hyo Lyn as the person leaving.

1454
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,930
Of course, Hyo Lyn should leave.

1455
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,490
- Let's have Seobinggo...
-  Hyo Lyn didn't do anything wrong.

1456
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,270
- the place of departure.
-  How does this sound?

1457
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:49,010
Hyo Lyn, pack mosquito repellent, Baby.

1458
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,310
- That's great.
-  You're good.

1459
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,350
- He can do it so easily.
-  That sounds great.

1460
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,190
Pack mosquito repellent, Baby.

1461
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,430
Why don't you add piranha here?

1462
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,960
- Pack mosquito repellent
-  Then Hyo Lyn becomes a piranha.

1463
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
It sounds strange.

1464
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,460
Kwang Soo, stay quiet. Just sing later.

1465
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,140
- Just sing a verse and leave.
-  It's my first time.

1466
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,490
- Pack mosquito repellent, Baby
-  I've never done it before.

1467
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,190
- I don't know how the song goes.
-  "Mosquitoes there..."

1468
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,160
"may get jealous of you". What if that comes next?

1469
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,060
Those are the exact lyrics I hate.

1470
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,190
- It's my personal opinion.
-  I get paid...

1471
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,550
for writing lyrics.

1472
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,660
- Gosh.
-  That wasn't very good.

1473
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,930
- Shall we pick a theme?
-  Yes.

1474
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:34,390
If we write lyrics with words that relate to food,

1475
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,830
these will be easy to use.

1476
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,630
Chogyeguksu.

1477
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,560
A magical phrase to use when writing lyrics...

1478
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,070
is "by the way".

1479
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,330
Does it work every time?

1480
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,560
You can say, "I love you, by the way, insect collection is..."

1481
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,260
(That's right.)

1482
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,810
- It works for everything.
-  This is it.

1483
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,790
"I want to go to Hawaii. By the way, I'm craving chogyeguksu"?

1484
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,240
Let's make the title of this song "By the Way".

1485
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,760
That's a possibility.

1486
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,390
We have to earn more points,

1487
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,760
but it's hard because we need to use those words.

1488
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,530
- When this season ends
-  When this season ends.

1489
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,060
It doesn't fit the notes.

1490
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,230
When the season ends, mosquitoes start to disappear,

1491
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,690
- Baby
-  All right,

1492
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,930
- that works.
-  I know.

1493
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:20,330
- Just sing it a bit differently.
-  Disappear, Baby.

1494
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,330
That's right.

1495
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,830
It's Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach.

1496
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,050
- That's right.
-  We can also sing like this.

1497
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,760
Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach is great.

1498
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,890
- Great, that works.
-  Make "Se" longer.

1499
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,950
- Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach is great
-  Let's do that.

1500
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,830
- Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach is great
-  No.

1501
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,290
(Elongate the "Se", Jae Seok.)

1502
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,420
How about this?

1503
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,830
(I want it to be like this.)

1504
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,130
- Yours sounds better.
-  Right?

1505
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,930
I've never seen anyone fight over the notes.

1506
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,590
- Let's move on.
-  We'll go back to that phrase.

1507
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,110
For the "piranha", let's just say we cook and eat it...

1508
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,560
after the beach part.

1509
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,590
How about this?

1510
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:03,430
Holding hands is too common of an expression.

1511
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,730
Will you bite my hand once, piranha?

1512
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,190
(How about this?)

1513
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:12,160
(It is quite a scary song.)

1514
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,930
Sometimes, you want to bite someone out of happiness.

1515
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,630
- Right?
-  That sounds good.

1516
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,760
When you love someone, you want to bite that person.

1517
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,230
"Bite me like a piranha would."

1518
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,390
I think that works.

1519
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:27,660
(Team Singers are lost in too many food-related words.)

1520
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,090
That's not it.

1521
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,080
(Do I need to change it?)

1522
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,930
Shall we change it to "let's be as passionate as Hawaii"?

1523
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,480
We have to make it past tense.

1524
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,960
I think the original is okay too.

1525
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,460
Just use the original phrase.

1526
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,960
Change it to "I like it because we are passionate, Baby".

1527
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
- I like the first one better.
-  Okay.

1528
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,930
- Let's start over.
-  It sounds more sophisticated.

1529
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,230
Use the first one.

1530
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,290
(It's a state of chaos.)

1531
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,590
It's really difficult as we have so many singers.

1532
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,860
Look at this.

1533
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,190
- "The Battle of Flamingos".
-  Shall we shout out that one...

1534
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,940
meaninglessly?

1535
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,830
We can suddenly shout, "the Battle of Flamingos"!

1536
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,890
It doesn't have to relate to the lyrics.

1537
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,660
- It's to show our excitement.
-  That sounds fine.

1538
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,930
How about this?

1539
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,830
We say "hey" several times throughout the song.

1540
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,890
It happens four times. So how about...

1541
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,060
- Open the window
-  The.

1542
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,560
- And shout
-  Battle.

1543
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,260
- Then it's "open the window" again.
-  Of.

1544
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,060
- And shout
-  Flamingos.

1545
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:19,330
Wouldn't that be too sly?

1546
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:22,730
- We'll be singing live.
-  This is just...

1547
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:23,830
Throw it away.

1548
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,630
(How will Team Non-singers change the lyrics?)

1549
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,930
When they held hands, the hand smells like kongguksu.

1550
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,960
- That's right.
-  It smells like kongguksu.

1551
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,130
No, that doesn't work.

1552
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,660
We should have a part that's funny.

1553
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,190
Since it sounds too average,

1554
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,290
- let's make it fun.
-  It should be fun.

1555
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,990
Please give me a discount.

1556
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,990
- That's awesome.
-  Isn't it great?

1557
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:45,430
If you're going to be this late, you should give me a discount.

1558
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,080
Gunmandu, mulmandu.

1559
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,360
(What is that?)

1560
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,930
- I knew he'd say that.
-  Did you?

1561
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,860
- How about we do this?
-  No way.

1562
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,090
(What kind of lyrics will Team Singers create?)

1563
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,430
(It's time for the real competition.)

1564
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,160
(Rehearsal on stage starts.)

1565
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,930
Let's practise this part.

1566
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,360
Let's try this at the end.

1567
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,990
There are eight verses before that part.

1568
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,970
(Is this the delivery dance to fit the food-related lyrics?)

1569
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,730
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1570
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:15,130
(Team Non-singers make a cute and fresh dance to match the song.)

1571
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,890
That's great.

1572
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,160
It's better than the original.

1573
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,160
The original song turned into a song about food.

1574
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,230
It's unbelievable.

1575
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,660
(Which team will win today?)

1576
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,250
As you earned the Performance Order Card,

1577
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,150
you may choose the order in which you'll go.

1578
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,730
- Let's go last.
-  Wouldn't that be better?

1579
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,530
It's better to watch them first.

1580
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,720
- Yes.
-  All right.

1581
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,600
- Team Non-singers will go first.
-  Okay.

1582
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,360
Once the audience is seated,

1583
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,330
you can start the performance.

1584
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,230
(The evaluation group enters.)

1585
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:56,260
We've invited a small audience to watch your performance.

1586
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,930
They'll evaluate you fairly because...

1587
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:03,630
they're students who study Literary Creation and Practical Music.

1588
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,260
(There are even Practical Music students.)

1589
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,560
No way.

1590
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,930
(We're in trouble.)

1591
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,390
- What?
-  They're music students.

1592
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:14,070
(Students who major in music are ready to evaluate them.)

1593
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,230
(This is their score card.)

1594
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,560
(There are 4 criteria for today's evaluation.)

1595
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,990
The seven judges have received the lyrics.

1596
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:25,830
We'll also send them the video of your performances.

1597
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,410
(The list of seven judges)

1598
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,690
- Please go on stage.
-  Okay.

1599
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,560
- Let's do a good job.
-  I'm nervous.

1600
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,110
(Each half of the score comes from the audience and the 7 judges.)

1601
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,430
Good luck. Competing isn't important.

1602
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,230
I hope we all do a good job.

1603
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,090
- You can do it.
-  Good luck.

1604
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,460
Running Man's "Changing Lyrics Project" will start soon.

1605
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,930
Please be seated.

1606
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,730
- In 1, 2, 3, let's go.
-  Let's go.

1607
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,490
Going last is better.

1608
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:54,190
Team Non-singers will liven up the mood,

1609
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,630
but we're the main singers.

1610
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,930
("Highway Romance" is on standby.)

1611
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,330
(Their hearts beat fast.)

1612
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,990
Please welcome the first team.

1613
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:14,130
(Finally, their song starts.)

1614
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,260
- Hello, thank you for coming.
-  Hello.

1615
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,830
(Who am I? Where am I?)

1616
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,460
(3 late summer Running Man series.)

1617
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,560
Game of Emperor's Throne.

1618
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,460
(Running Man and Scarlet Heart Ryeo on August 28.)

1619
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,890
Running Map, the ones who seek secrets of the map.

1620
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,560
Train to Prison.

1621
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,330
I think strange people appeared.

1622
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,690
(Running Man and who else?)

1623
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,990
(Game of Emperor's Throne, Running Map, Train to Prison)

1624
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,930
(Finally, their song starts.)

1625
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,990
- Hello, thank you for coming.
-  Hello.

1626
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,660
(Who am I? Where am I?)

1627
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,590
("Highway Romance" by Team Non-singers)

1628
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:59,060
(It sings about Hyo Lyn's excitement as she heads to the ocean.)

1629
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,190
They're dancing...

1630
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,990
like this.

1631
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,990
Hyo Lyn, pack mosquito repellent, Baby.

1632
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:10,930
Baby.

1633
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:16,330
When the season ends, mosquitoes start to disappear, Baby.

1634
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,160
Baby.

1635
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:23,330
Will you bite my hand once, Piranha?

1636
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,260
Piranha, piranha.

1637
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:31,460
Is today real or just a dream?

1638
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,930
Gimnyeong Seonsegi Beach is great.

1639
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,960
Sizzling sun is great, too.

1640
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,630
- Heatstroke
-  Heatstroke

1641
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,060
I'm not afraid of it.

1642
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,160
Where are we? Are we passing Seobinggo?

1643
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,130
I feel like we're in the living room.

1644
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,230
Go.

1645
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,130
(The audience is evaluating objectively.)

1646
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,690
A little faster.

1647
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,130
(Let's get to the highlight.)

1648
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,830
- Open the window
-  The.

1649
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,110
- Goodness.
-  Open the window.

1650
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,890
- Open the window
-  The.

1651
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,730
- And shout
-  Battle.

1652
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,260
We're going to the sea.

1653
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:16,830
With a straw handbag and wearing off the shoulder tops.

1654
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,530
We'll be back all tanned.

1655
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,230
- Open the window
-  Of.

1656
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,090
- And shout
-  Flamingos.

1657
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:28,490
We love each other too much.

1658
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,160
We lost our minds

1659
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,390
I like travelling.

1660
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,960
Summer dream.

1661
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,330
(The original singer adds a lot of ad-lib.)

1662
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,830
(He's doing a weird dance.)

1663
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:50,490
One more time.

1664
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,860
- Open the window
-  The.

1665
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,530
- And shout
-  Battle.

1666
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,060
We're going to the sea.

1667
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,830
They're like a choir.

1668
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,930
Let's...

1669
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,360
do one movement at the same time.

1670
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,420
They keep dancing.

1671
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,130
- Open the window
-  Of.

1672
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,830
- And shout
-  Flamingos.

1673
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:13,430
We love each other too much.

1674
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,160
We lost our minds

1675
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,590
- I like travelling
-  One more time.

1676
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,530
- Open the window
-  The Battle.

1677
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,330
- And shout
-  Of Flamingos.

1678
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,860
(They might as well open up a flamingo farm.)

1679
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,230
(Their last shout)

1680
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,930
(4 points for the content and the context)

1681
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,760
Summer dream.

1682
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,290
(They finish the song with a cute pose.

1683
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,060
(They're satisfied.)

1684
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,760
(Please give us a perfect score.)

1685
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:51,560
Summer dream.

1686
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,190
(Team Non-singers finishes performing.)

1687
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,830
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

1688
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,060
Thank you.

1689
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,330
I can't lift my face.

1690
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,730
- What have we done?
-  We worked hard.

1691
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,890
- Good job.
-  We worked very hard. Thank you.

1692
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,960
- Gosh.
-  It's so embarrassing.

1693
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,290
It's so embarrassing.

1694
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:11,730
- It's so embarrassing.
-  Goodness.

1695
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,790
It's much more embarrassing than I thought.

1696
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,530
Why do I feel embarrassed when we did well?

1697
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,490
They didn't laugh at all.

1698
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,190
It's because they have to evaluate us.

1699
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,230
- Shall we get off stage?
-  You have to do it.

1700
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,890
It'll be better to get off stage.

1701
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:23,590
- Shall we get off stage?
-  Do it when they clap.

1702
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:27,060
(They add a little spice to their performance.)

1703
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,990
This is quite organised.

1704
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,090
We sang very well.

1705
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,130
We sang well together.

1706
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,460
(What's the score for Team Non-singers?)

1707
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,760
Thank you for your support.

1708
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,530
Please welcome the second team.

1709
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,290
(They're very excited.)

1710
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,660
(Bada appears.)

1711
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,330
(She's the original idol.)

1712
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,060
(She laughs.)

1713
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,790
("Delivery Romance" by Team Singers)

1714
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,460
It's so much fun.

1715
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,890
(It sings about Bada who falls in love with a delivery boy.)

1716
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,660
Isn't that too much?

1717
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,060
That's too much.

1718
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:09,400
I like that we're hot like Hawaii, Baby.

1719
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:16,690
But I don't like your refrigerator pants, so bye.

1720
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,860
(A man appears.)

1721
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:24,490
- Will you hold my hand, Baby?
-  Baby.

1722
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:32,360
We've been really waiting for this trip to Busan

1723
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:39,830
I like chogyeguksu and also watermelon salad

1724
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:46,830
I'd like to eat anything with you.

1725
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:54,130
Is kongguksu here yet? Please be quick like a water gun

1726
01:08:54,130 --> 01:09:01,060
I won't forgive you if you're late.

1727
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:07,400
What a quick delivery it is

1728
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,550
I love you.

1729
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:15,560
Can you hear my heart bouncing like a peanut boat?

1730
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,190
As if you're doing an insect collection.

1731
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:26,230
Please catch and trap me I love you so much.

1732
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:32,130
Don't forget your helmet.

1733
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,160
Bada, let's go!

1734
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,090
- Let's go.
-  Look at the sea!

1735
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,090
Bada, get on.

1736
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,660
Here comes our motorcycle.

1737
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,130
(He has transformed into a motorcycle.)

1738
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,660
Let's go!

1739
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,400
That wasn't in their original plan.

1740
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,960
They just thought of it. There wasn't anything like that.

1741
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:52,690
(They're near the climax of the song.)

1742
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,460
Please catch and trap me.

1743
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,330
(Amazing chorus by Bada)

1744
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,560
I love you so much.

1745
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,760
My goodness.

1746
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,430
Bada is really good.

1747
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,560
(They join the audience for a strong finish.)

1748
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,710
They went down the stage.

1749
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,630
(They try to "catch and trap" their audience's attention.)

1750
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:16,690
Clap!

1751
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:20,830
(We're definitely ahead in stage performance.)

1752
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,190
Don't forget your helmet.

1753
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,990
(The song finally ends.)

1754
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,490
Thank you.

1755
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,830
- I'm so happy, Bada.
-  Yeah.

1756
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,870
Well done.

1757
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,130
That was a neat finish.

1758
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,090
There was something that was unscripted.

1759
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,190
- Yes?
-  It was sudden.

1760
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,790
- What do you mean?
-  You can be honest with us.

1761
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,070
- Bada got on Jong Kook's back.
-  That wasn't planned, was it?

1762
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,590
Everything went as we had planned.

1763
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,090
We have different strengths.

1764
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:47,290
Your performance was very plain and typical.

1765
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,930
It was about harmony.

1766
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,430
Ours was more of a free-style.

1767
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,470
What happened to your lyrics?

1768
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,930
We have all the words...

1769
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:57,190
- and proverb in our lyrics.
-  We do, too.

1770
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,490
"Hyo Lyn, don't forget to take the mosquito repellent, Baby."

1771
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,330
"When the season ends, mosquitoes start to disappear."

1772
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,290
- That's how you did it.
-  Can you see?

1773
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,160
Look at how we put "Baby" at the end of the proverb.

1774
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,480
It makes the lyrics sound a lot less typical and boring.

1775
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,590
"Can you bite my hand once, Piranha?" Does this make sense?

1776
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:12,030
- It makes sense.
-  How could it?

1777
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:15,290
- "Find out whether we're..."
-  It makes sense, right?

1778
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,730
You're asking the piranha to see if...

1779
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,430
- you're dreaming or not?
-  That's right.

1780
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:19,560
It will cost your finger at least.

1781
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,460
"Be quick like a water gun. I won't forgive you if you're late."

1782
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,490
Why is a water gun fast?

1783
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,690
- It is fast.
-  It shoots water very quickly.

1784
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,460
- It's slow. I can see the water.
-  Are you sure?

1785
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,640
I can even dodge it.

1786
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,590
You were talking about a trip and now, it's about a delivery man.

1787
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:35,090
Look. The girl went to Busan for a trip and met that man there.

1788
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,130
- She met a delivery man in Busan?
-  That's right.

1789
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,590
Then there should've been Busan dialect.

1790
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,290
I love it because it's hot like Hawaii.

1791
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,930
- Like this.
-  No way.

1792
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,460
That's what Jong Kook did.

1793
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,490
He said it like this to mimic the dialect.

1794
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,960
- That's from Jeolla-do.
-  That's a different dialect.

1795
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:52,030
- But our opinions don't matter.
-  You're right.

1796
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,590
(The audience's scores are what matters.)

1797
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,990
(They begin their evaluation.)

1798
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,660
(They have finished evaluating.)

1799
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,090
(The 7 judges have finished their evaluations, too.)

1800
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:10,160
Everyone, we have your scores.

1801
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,530
I guess our scores must be really good.

1802
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:15,490
You could get the maximum of 100 points from the students...

1803
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:19,230
and another 100 points from the 7 judges.

1804
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,230
So in total, you could get 200 points in total.

1805
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,330
- I'll tell you the final scores.
-  Okay.

1806
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,440
What are our scores?

1807
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,030
(What's the difference between their scores?)

1808
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:33,790
You got 140.1 points and 142.7 points.

1809
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:36,560
- Really?
-  It's really close.

1810
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,180
- Is it 142.7?
-  It is so close.

1811
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,560
- What were the scores again?
-  The difference is only 2.6 points.

1812
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,590
- Only 2.6 points?
-  That's it?

1813
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,490
- No way.
-  Are you sure?

1814
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,090
- So which team won?
-  I have no idea.

1815
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,230
I really don't have any idea.

1816
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:49,310
The lyrics from "Delivery Romance"...

1817
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:53,190
are so closely linked together.

1818
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:59,400
What a quick delivery it is

1819
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,430
I love you.

1820
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:03,430
"As if you're doing an insect collection"...

1821
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:06,690
"Please catch and trap me". This part...

1822
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,730
is really catchy.

1823
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,790
I think it will stay in my head...

1824
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,290
and make me hum.

1825
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,690
- That's good.
-  That was a good evaluation.

1826
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,890
I knew I could count on her.

1827
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,630
The lyrics of "Beltway Romance"...

1828
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,790
are not really...

1829
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,540
connected.

1830
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,480
They are somewhat simple, too.

1831
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,560
Also, the sentences sound quite unnatural.

1832
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,990
When the season ends, mosquitoes start to disappear.

1833
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:41,030
Can you bite my hand once, Piranha?

1834
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:44,400
I'm sorry to say this,

1835
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,160
but I have no idea what they were trying to say with your lyrics.

1836
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,790
I'm sorry.

1837
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,400
That was really harsh.

1838
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,790
- Disjointed and simple.
-  That's harsh.

1839
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:56,290
"Beltway Romance"...

1840
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,210
successfully created a big image with their lyrics.

1841
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,740
It was a big harmony.

1842
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,930
I knew I could count on him.

1843
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,790
"Delivery Romance" did well,

1844
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,930
(He compliments "Delivery Romance" as well.)

1845
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,090
but their lyrics were disorderly.

1846
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,930
- It was a disorder.
-  He loves that team.

1847
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:12,060
Only Bada did a great job.

1848
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,920
- That's true.
-  I guess he didn't hear our rhyme.

1849
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,050
"Bye, bye, Baby".

1850
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,290
You can go tell him.

1851
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,760
We love another Jin Mo, Joo Jin Mo. Not him.

1852
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,430
There's a talented person in "Beltway Romance".

1853
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:25,030
- "The Battle of Flamingos" was...
-  It's because she knows Jong Shin.

1854
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,380
A really difficult phrase to insert in their lyrics,

1855
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,290
but they separated the phrase in many words and inserted them in.

1856
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,030
- That was really smart.
-  She's so good.

1857
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,790
- Nicely done.
-  We deserve points with that one.

1858
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,270
Kim Ea Na is so good.

1859
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,290
"Delivery Romance"...

1860
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:40,790
seems lost with their lyrics.

1861
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,560
When people who never wrote lyrics before...

1862
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,460
are asked to write or change lyrics.

1863
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,800
Many words are placed randomly.

1864
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,690
Can I take out some points from them?

1865
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,370
I can't?

1866
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,930
Does she not know what "diversity" is?

1867
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,960
I'm going to review every single song she ever wrote.

1868
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,090
I will find every single mistake and post them on the internet.

1869
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,310
- The webtoon artist, Jo Seok.
-  Yes. Jo Seok.

1870
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,560
For performance scores,

1871
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,660
he said that he's a big fan of Kim Kyung Ho.

1872
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,190
(Jo Seok is a fan of Kim Kyung Ho.)

1873
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,230
He said that he had to give the perfect score for performance.

1874
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,230
The perfect score?

1875
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,290
You should've kept dancing.

1876
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,090
- Thank you.
-  He stopped in the middle of it.

1877
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:16,480
- Yes, he stopped.
-  It's so unexpected.

1878
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,120
About "Delivery Romance",

1879
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,960
he questioned why the narrator suddenly...

1880
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,090
went out for an insect collection while waiting for delivery.

1881
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,290
Does he not know metaphors?

1882
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,990
- What's wrong with him?
-  Does he really not know?

1883
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,490
But he was okay about being bitten by a piranha?

1884
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,090
- Was it okay?
-  I guess so.

1885
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,880
That person lost his finger.

1886
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,830
Park Bo Young evaluated very carefully and precisely.

1887
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,160
She said it was unfair for the original songwriter to participate.

1888
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,900
- That's right.
-  It's unfair.

1889
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,090
- He shouldn't help.
-  Of course not.

1890
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:45,330
You'll realise that it's not unfair at all if you come and work with us.

1891
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,030
- That's right.
-  I had no idea.

1892
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,230
He didn't help us at all.

1893
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,590
Seriously. We were handicapped.

1894
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,180
Announcer Bae Sung Jae mentioned that...

1895
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,090
- Yes.
-  Announcer Bae Sung Jae.

1896
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:58,190
He said "Beltway Romance's" lyrics had an impressive introduction,

1897
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,330
but later parts were almost the same as the original song.

1898
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,660
It was like an anticlimax.

1899
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,230
How could he say that?

1900
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,290
That is harsh.

1901
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,590
Yes. Their song sounded almost the same.

1902
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,190
They didn't change the lyrics.

1903
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:09,330
Sung Jae. Don't be nosy and focus on your work.

1904
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:11,080
Your commentaries were anticlimax.

1905
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,090
Your brother is a lot better than you. He's a great actor.

1906
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,060
About "Delivery Romance", he said the lyrics were...

1907
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,930
closely related and that the words...

1908
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,790
were catchy and well-placed.

1909
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,400
- Bae Sung Jae.
-  Bae Sung Jae.

1910
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,090
- He's good.
-  I knew we could count on him.

1911
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,830
He knows something about lyrics.

1912
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,490
- He's sensible.
-  He's the best commentator.

1913
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,760
- Bae Sung Jae is so good.
-  He surely knows the trend.

1914
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,790
He's amazing.

1915
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,330
In total, it's 140.1 points versus 142.7 points.

1916
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,570
- I have no idea about the winner.
-  I have no clue.

1917
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,590
So...

1918
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,760
(What is the outcome?)

1919
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,190
The team that scored 142.7 points is...

1920
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,790
(Which team was it?)

1921
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:49,560
(Which team has won the game?)

1922
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,790
Team Singers.

1923
01:16:56,790 --> 01:17:00,900
(Team Singers wins.)

1924
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,490
(Team Singers wins by 2.6 points.)

1925
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,760
- Yes.
-  That was so close.

1926
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,590
- We won the audience over.
-  Yes, that's right.

1927
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,830
- We won them over.
-  We did it.

1928
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,030
- We performed well on stage.
-  Well done, Jong Kook.

1929
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,780
- Bada did an amazing job.
-  No. I didn't.

1930
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,090
- It was because they went last.
-  You're right.

1931
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,590
We lost almost all the games today.

1932
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,490
Here are two Special Badges...

1933
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,330
and four Golden Musical Badges.

1934
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,330
(The winning team receives the Badges.)

1935
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,490
- Well done.
-  Good job.

1936
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:29,060
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

1937
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,060
(We'd like to thank all the guests.)

1938
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,960

(Running Women.)

1940
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,850
Are you here to ruin Running Man?

1941
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,400
They're toying with us. It's hopeless.

1942
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,400
(The men are intimidated.)

1943
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,760
Just stop it.

1944
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,480
I will make you a hero today.

1945
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,690
Take that!

1946
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,400
(Are you ready to meet these women?)

1947
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,930
Did I do well?

1948
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,260
Jong Kook.

1949
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,060
