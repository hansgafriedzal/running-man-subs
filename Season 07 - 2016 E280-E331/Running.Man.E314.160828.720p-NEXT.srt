00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,230
(Game of Emperor's Throne)

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,680
(In the beginning of the R Empire, there were 10 princes.)

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,810
(Princes Jae Seok, Jong Kook and Kwang Soo)

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,410
(Princes Ji Hyo, Haha, Seok Jin and Gary)

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,080
(Princes Lee Joon Gi, Kang Ha Neul and Hong Jong Hyun)

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,410
(The day of the proclamation for the emperor's heir)

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,410
I just wanted to let you know in advance...

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,710
that I'm willing to give everyone a spot when I take the throne.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,610
(What did you say?)

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,780
You're so uneducated and vulgar.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,320
(Princess Jong Kook and her brothers, Haha and Jong Hyun)

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,780
- Where did that come from?
 -  How dare you look me in the eyes?

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,780
What just happened?

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,310
(Princess Jae Seok and her brothers, Ha Neul and Ji Hyo)

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,340
- I'm Princess Kwang Soo's brother.
 -  You're my brother?

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,740
- You're his brother?
 -  Yes.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,510
(Princess Kwang Soo and her brother, Gary)

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,340
(The Rebellion of the Princes)

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,710
I'm sure we will be take the throne.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,510
You know, considering all things including the looks.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,340
Do you want to start a fight?

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,600
- Do you want to start a fight?
 -  Try me.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,110
- Let's see what happens.
 -  You little...

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,680
Did you even finish studying the Chunjamoon?

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,610
- Have you?
 -  Chunjamoon?

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,940
Whatever you say.

27
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,450
I know you got in here through some special admission.

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,780
- My goodness.
 -  It's funny you say that.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,930
There's bad blood running in your family.

30
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,010
Princess Kwang Soo has the superior genes.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,980
- What did you say?
 -  Our family is the most superior.

32
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,910
- Why would you say that?
 -  She doesn't look superior at all.

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,590
Aren't you a totem pole? Shouldn't you be standing outside?

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,130
(There are suspicions on Princess Kwang Soo's origins.)

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,230
- Did you call me a totem pole?
 -  Yes, I did.

36
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,750
(There is so much drama.)

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,510
I'd like to make things clear.

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,180
Once the emperor has spoken, it's final.

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,310
- It is final.
 -  Whatever.

40
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,180
- It's going to be me.
 -  Goodness.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,040
Don't you work at the tavern?

42
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,980
Don't get me started.

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,540
(Do you want some of this?)

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,570
- How dare you?
 -  Can I get a pint of mead?

45
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,640
Don't make me angry.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
Do you have what it takes to take the throne?

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm just her brother.

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,430
- What was that?
 -  Who is that?

49
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,380
Here comes Your Majesty!

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,310
- What's going on?
 -  Who is that?

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,440
- Honey!
 -  It's the emperor!

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,710
- Honey!
 -  Hey, Honey.

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,710
(He enters with a glowing appearance.)

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
- Honey.
 -  It's the emperor!

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
- Honey!
 -  Honey!

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,210
(Emperor Lee Joon Gi)

57
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,120
Honey!

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,680
- Our Highness is so sexy.
 -  Honey.

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,280
- That's my husband.
 -  Oh, Honey.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,110
Don't you think that's getting old?

61
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,610
- What does that make me?
 -  That's not funny any more.

62
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,840
Quiet down.

63
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,350
I've said this many times. There is no order in the palace.

64
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,800
Fire all of them, Honey.

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,510
That's not how you talk to the emperor!

66
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,140
- He called him Honey.
 -  He's my husband, after all.

67
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,740
- He should be kicked out.
 -  I said, quiet down!

68
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Quiet down!

69
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,340
His Majesty has spoken!

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,040
Yes, sorry.

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,700
What's wrong with you all?

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,410
I say Joon Gi, you say Emperor.

73
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,640
- Joon Gi.
 -  Emperor.

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,210
I say Joon Gi, you say awesome.

75
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,310
- Joon Gi.
 -  Awesome.

76
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,310
Make some noise.

77
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,140
(They'll do anything he says.)

78
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,680
- That's much better.
 -  The emperor speaks English.

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,210
- Is he drunk?
 -  Is he a DJ?

80
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,280
He has adopted the Western civilisation.

81
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,340
I've been traveling there.

82
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,110
Anyway, there's a reason...

83
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,240
why I summoned you all.

84
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,140
I will pick the heir to the throne.

85
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,810
- It's about time, Your Majesty.
 -  Yes.

86
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,980
I've heard the news...

87
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,880
that the princes are fighting over the throne.

88
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,180
I shall send my sons to the future...

89
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,440
and make them compete for it.

90
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,120
What did he say?

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
Are you ready?

92
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,180
(The bloody battle between the 10 princes begins.)

93
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,880
(They shall fight for the throne in future times.)

94
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,510
(Only one will survive to take the throne.)

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,010
(Who will become the last survivor?)

96
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,110
- Understood, Your Majesty.
 -  Understood, Your Majesty.

97
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,840
I will choose the new emperor...

98
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,810
on the day the Moon and the Sun overlap.

99
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,840
(The heir will be chosen then.)

100
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,440
Take this.

101
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,280
(You will meet again on the day they overlap.)

102
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,840
(The scroll is passed down to the princes in the future.)

103
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh my.

104
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,340
(Future princes, follow the emperor's commands.)

105
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
What is this?

106
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,310
(He throws it back.)

107
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,310
(Take it back.)

108
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,480
(He plays around.)

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,780
What is this? Is this the scroll from the past?

110
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,880
(The Emperor of the R Empire commands you.)

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
I will choose the new emperor...

112
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,040
on the day the Moon and the Sun overlap.

113
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,480
I can't count the times I've travelled to the past.

114
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,340
"To the princes who were born with the destiny of the empire,"

115
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,010
"the Game of Emperor's Throne is about to begin."

116
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,250
"Game of Emperor's Throne"?

117
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,710
(Game of Emperor's Throne)

118
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,590
(Three more princes are invited to the Game of Emperor's Throne.)

119
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,610
I feel like they're going to throw something at us.

120
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,710
(They seem to be handsome.)

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,080
(Yes, this is how princes should look like.)

122
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,780
(They have travelled time from the R Empire...)

123
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,250
(and have brought their handsomeness with them.)

124
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,250
Look out.

125
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,810
(He grabs it.)

126
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,910
(Nice catch)

127
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,610
(He's already into it.)

128
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,780
It's time.

129
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,380
It looks like it's from them.

130
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,610
I think so too.

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,880
Are you ready?

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,380
- Yes, we are.
 -  Yes, I am.

133
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,240
"To the princes who were born with the destiny of the empire,"

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
"the Game of Emperor's Throne is about to begin."

135
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,610
"You shall pass through where the sun and the moon overlap."

136
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,880
"In order to do so, you must win over the hearts of the people."

137
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,080
(The scroll explains the rules of the game.)

138
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,410
(It's a clue pointing where they must go.)

139
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,720
(They must interact with the citizens.)

140
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,100
I think something big is about to happen.

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,910
I must be from the past.

142
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,680
Come on, it's the 21st century.

143
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,880
What is this story about princes and the empire?

144
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,140
Does this even make sense?

145
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,580
I don't understand a single word. What is this talking about?

146
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,960
- So we're working individually?
 -  Yes.

147
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,910
I shouldn't have shared this with you two.

148
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,560
I was wrong.

149
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,280
I thought this was a team game.

150
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,910
I'll be going now.

151
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,010
Where are you going?

152
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,310
Do you want to see my kick?

153
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,610
- Don't make me do that.
 -  I was going to the restroom.

154
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,310
We thought that it wouldn't be a fair game...

155
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,280
since you're against a very experienced group of people.

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
So we will provide you with items for the game.

157
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,440
The two of you appearing on the show for the third time will get this.

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,280
- This doesn't feel right.
 -  I have a weird feeling.

159
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,540
It's a voucher that allows me to participate in this show again.

160
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,510
(That's funny!)

161
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,740
You're so greedy.

162
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,880
(Prince Ha Neul is hungry for TV appearance.)

163
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,310
Look at that colour.

164
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,880
Is this possible?

165
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,510
It must be blood.

166
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,580
Don't look.

167
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,610
I don't want you to get a head start.

168
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,680
(He takes a quick glimpse.)

169
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,570
(What item did Prince Joon Gi get?)

170
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,740
I hope these two will shine today.

171
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,710
As for me, I'll just strive to do my best.

172
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,050
He's not going to go easy on us.

173
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,840
- It's begun.
 -  So it begins.

174
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,740
Okay, let's go.

175
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,430
- Good luck.
 -  You too.

176
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,940
- Wish me luck.
 -  Hey, hey.

177
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,710
You'll be seeing my kick today.

178
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,780
(Everyone's an enemy in battle.)

179
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,510
(Jong Hyun is running away.)

180
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,680
Let me give you some tips.

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,510
How do I get to the ground floor?

182
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,010
- Hey, Jong Hyun.
 -  I found it.

183
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,880
Calm down, Jong Hyun.

184
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,480
Hey, it's right over here.

185
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,040
Ha Neul, sorry to bother you but I left something back there.

186
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,240
- Can you go get it?
 -  I'll get it after this all ends.

187
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,310
(Joon Gi, your trick is so obvious.)

188
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,780
(Win the support of the people to compete for the throne.)

189
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,110
I will approach the first person I see.

190
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,780
"I am a prince..."

191
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,810
"of R Empire."

192
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,710
"As one of my people,"

193
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,440
"do you know my name?"

194
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,300
- "I am a prince of R Empire."
 -  Gosh. You surprised me.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,790
- "Do you know my name?"
 -  "Do you know my name?"

196
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,710
- I don't know who you are.
 -  You are Grasshopper.

197
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,110
- What?
 -  You are Grasshopper. Aren't you?

198
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,180
Your name must be Shorty, then.

199
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,040
You must be on your way.

200
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,180
- Hey.
 -  They are my people.

201
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,780
- What are you talking about?
 -  Go away.

202
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,440
Look at your clothes.

203
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,850
You tried to look fancy? It's just horrible.

204
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,980
I must find a person who seems good at playing games.

205
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,510
Ji Hyo.

206
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,440
Long time no see, Jong Hyun.

207
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
Hello. "I'm a prince of R Empire."

208
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,020
(I'm happy to see this lady, not you.)

209
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,780
Hey. She is mine.

210
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,810
Who is this? Hi, Jong Hyun.

211
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,810
Hello.

212
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,310
"I am a prince of R Empire. Do you know my name?"

213
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,610
- That... What was it?
 -  It's Jong Hyun.

214
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,780
Let's see.

215
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,010
Let's find out...

216
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
who are my people.

217
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,880
Hello.

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
(He's greeting his fans.)

219
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Thank you.

220
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,450
"I am a prince of R Empire."

221
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,820
"As one of my people, do you know my name?"

222
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,710
- I do.
 -  What is it then?

223
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,210
- It's Lee Joon Gi.
 -  You're correct.

224
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,170
Now, you can join me. Will you come with me?

225
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,510
(Screaming)

226
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
All right.

227
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
- It's "Two Bodies, One Heart".
 -  I'll give you the words.

228
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,380
Choose between action and melo. One, two, three.

229
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,140
- Melo.
 -  Action.

230
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,670
That's okay.

231
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,410
What was the dialogue? R... R...

232
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm R... "I'm a prince of R Empire."

233
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,510
- "As one of my people..."
 -  Ask if they know your name.

234
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,080
Gosh. Do I really have to say this?

235
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,980
Okay. I'll choose him.

236
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,810
(Grabbing)

237
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,510
"I am a prince of R Empire."

238
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,710
"As one of my people,"

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,540
"do you know my name?"

240
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,950
No, I don't.

241
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,780
- Kim...
 -  What?

242
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,410
No, it doesn't start with "Kim". It doesn't.

243
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,740
"Do you know my name?"

244
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,310
- What?
 -  I don't know. Sorry.

245
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,240
- Why not?
 -  Sorry. Bye.

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,940
- Please tell me you know my name.
 -  I'm sorry.

247
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,980
Please.

248
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,890
"I am a prince of R Empire."

249
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,480
"My people, do you know my name?"

250
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,210
- It's Lee Kwang Soo.
 -  That's right.

251
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,980
Thank you so much.

252
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,300
- It's "Two Bodies, One Heart".
 -  Okay.

253
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,940
Summer or winter. One, two, three.

254
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,240
- Summer.
 -  Summer.

255
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,210
(Prince Kwang Soo passes "Two Bodies, One Heart".)

256
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,210
Okay.

257
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,980
Should I go with her?

258
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,040
Okay. Let's go.

259
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,980
"I am a prince of R Empire."

260
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,580
"As one of my people, do you know my name?"

261
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,700
It's Kang Ha Neul.

262
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,580
That's right. Let's play "Two Bodies, One Heart".

263
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,610
It's "Two Bodies, One Heart" now.

264
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,510
Mulnaengmyun or bibimnaengmyun. One, two, three.

265
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,770
- Mulnaengmyun.
 -  Mulnaengmyun.

266
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,140
(Shouting)

267
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,410
I must go with him, right? All right. Please come with me.

268
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,070
"I am a prince of R Empire."

269
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,580
"As one of my people, do you know my name?"

270
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
- It's Hong Jong Hyun.
 -  That's correct.

271
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,210
Please tell me the next game. We must be really quick.

272
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,540
- Hurry. We must be quick.
 -  Oh, no. We must hurry.

273
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,710
Choose between mountain and sea. One, two, three.

274
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,840
- Sea.
 -  Sea.

275
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Can you spare a few minutes?

276
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,300
- Just a moment.
 -  Yes, I can.

277
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,910
All right. Let's go. Quickly.

278
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,180
(Screaming)

279
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,610
She is really enthusiastic.

280
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,810
"I am a prince of R Empire."

281
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,280
"As one of my people, do you know my name?"

282
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,940
- It's Lee Joon Gi.
 -  Correct.

283
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,210
Now, you can join me. Will you come with me?

284
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,410
- Yes. Of course.
 -  So your answer is yes?

285
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,910
Can I get a hug?

286
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,340
Of course.

287
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,140
Okay. Get ready.

288
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,400
Let's begin.

289
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,510
Choose between Coke or Sprite. One, two, three.

290
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,810
- Coke.
 -  Coke.

291
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,880
(Prince Joon Gi passes "Two Bodies, One Heart".)

292
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,510
She is a smart one.

293
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,680
(She is a smart one.)

294
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,840
(They need two balls in their crown to pass Sun's Gate and Moon's Gate.)

295
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,410
Bounce the ball high in the air. Bounce it hard.

296
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,310
(Bouncing)

297
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,510
Isn't it in? Give me a moment.

298
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,740
Why isn't the ball in? Let's try again.

299
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,540
Is the ball in? Okay.

300
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,910
Is it in?

301
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,910
I passed the mission, right?

302
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,480
- We passed it. We passed.
 -  Yes.

303
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,410
You bounced them really well.

304
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,080
(Now, they need to cast a spell to open Sun's Gate and Moon's Gate.)

305
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,380
- This time...
 -  Let's put the ball in at once.

306
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,240
- Bounce the ball like this.
 -  Hello, Jae Seok.

307
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,780
- Hello, Kwang Soo.
 -  Hello.

308
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,060
- Hello.
 -  Let's finish this in two throws.

309
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,180
What are you doing here?

310
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,450
(Kwang Soo blocks the ball.)

311
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,880
- That's a foul.
 -  Is he playing a game?

312
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Is this a mission?

313
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,010
- Kwang Soo is so annoying.
 -  Is this a mission?

314
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,710
- How can you do that?
 -  I didn't know.

315
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,710
All right. Two throws left.

316
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,110
(The ball goes in.)

317
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Just one more.

318
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
(They succeed once again.)

319
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,510
Yes. That's it.

320
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,310
- Are they finished?
 -  This is it. Come.

321
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
- What's going on?
 -  It's Kang Ha Neul.

322
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,910
Let's go back. It's you, Ha Neul.

323
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,030
- Hello, Ha Neul.
 -  What? Are you leaving already?

324
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,080
How have you been?

325
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,780
- Hello. How are you?
 -  Hi. Good to see you.

326
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,440
- Jong Hyun. How have you been?
 -  Hello, Haha.

327
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,600
- Get ready. Hurry.
 -  You must aim the crown...

328
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,740
and bounce the ball once like that.

329
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,340
We don't have any balls left. We must try one more time.

330
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
(Prince Ji Hyo fails the mission.)

331
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,110
(Prince Kwang Soo gives it a try.)

332
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
(The ball goes in.)

333
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,950
I got it.

334
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,400
(They are amazing.)

335
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,780
Open sesame!

336
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,180
(Prince Jong Kook is the first to pass the gate.)

337
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,930
(They have to cast a spell to open the gate.)

338
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,540
Open sesame!

339
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,880
(Prince Jae Seok is the second to pass the gate.)

340
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,840
(Open sesame!)

341
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,510
(Come to think of it, this is quite embarrassing.)

342
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,110
Why isn't the gate opening? Should I just go through?

343
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,240
(Prince Kwang Soo is the third to passes the gate.)

344
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Shall we begin now?

345
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,100
(Prince Ha Neul begins the mission.)

346
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,310
Catch it well.

347
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,930
(The ball goes in.)

348
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,280
(He's quite good.)

349
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,010
(He shouts in joy...)

350
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,040
(over his success.)

351
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,110
Thank you so much.

352
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,540
- You will travel back in time.
 -  Okay.

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,210
(Now, he has to cast the spell.)

354
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,210
(Laughing)

355
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,780
Open sesame!

356
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,310
(He shouts shyly.)

357
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,040
(Prince Ha Neul passes the gate fourth.)

358
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
(Prince Jong Hyun begins his mission.)

359
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,980
It was too low. Bounce the ball just a bit higher.

360
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I failed.

361
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,010
- Can I try one more time?
 -  Jong Hyun, come out.

362
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,210
That handsome brat...

363
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,940
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

364
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
(Another handsome brat, Joon Gi begins the game.)

365
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,940
(Bouncing)

366
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,410
(Come on, Prince!)

367
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,180
No. This is not right.

368
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
You must find another person to proceed.

369
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,180
It's okay.

370
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,310
(Don't worry.)

371
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,610
Open sesame.

372
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,780
(Prince Haha is the fifth to pass the gate.)

373
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,380
Open up sesame.

374
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,510
Wrong spell?

375
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,340
Open sesame for me.

376
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Why? What's wrong?

377
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
(It is said that he eventually passed quite a moment later.)

378
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,710
(Prince Jong Hyun gives it another try.)

379
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,410
I can't see the ball. Bounce it a bit higher.

380
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,610
(Meanwhile, Prince Joon Gi is busy having a good time with his fan.)

381
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,080
(Is the ball in or out?)

382
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,040
(It's in.)

383
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
All right. The last one.

384
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,010
(He needs only one more ball to pass.)

385
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,780
(Prince Jong Hyun passes the mission.)

386
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,540
- Thank you, Se Jun.
 -  Thank you.

387
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,080
Open sesame!

388
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,280
(Open sesame!)

389
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,980
(Prince Jong Hyun is the seventh to pass the gate.)

390
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,140
(Prince Gary is on his mission.)

391
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
The ball got in.

392
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
(No!)

393
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
No!

394
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,030
- It's in.
 -  No. I must go in before him.

395
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,780
Thank you. Open sesame.

396
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,310
Can I go in now?

397
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,410
(Prince Gary passes the gate as the eighth.)

398
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,080
(Only Prince Joon Gi and Prince Ji Hyo are left.)

399
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Nice.

400
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,580
(Is Prince Joon Gi about to cheat?)

401
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,710
(He just pretends.)

402
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,740
It's in.

403
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,180
(Prince Ji Hyo passes her mission.)

404
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,340
The ball finally got in.

405
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,810
(Oh, no.)

406
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,910
Open sesame!

407
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,780
(Prince Ji Hyo is the second last.)

408
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,610
(Only Prince Joon Gi is left here, alone.)

409
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,360
Okay.

410
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,210
(Prince Joon Gi finally passes his mission.)

411
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,480
Good job.

412
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
- You are really amazing.
 -  Thank you.

413
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,480
You're worthy to become my vassal.

414
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,910
My man. Oh my.

415
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,710
Thank you. See you in next life.

416
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,880
Open sesame!

417
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,140
(He might annoy the emperor if he comes too late.)

418
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,410
(It seems he doesn't care about it.)

419
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
(The ones how passed the Sun's gate,)

420
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,240
(are you ready to fight?)

421
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,210
(The secret of your birth...)

422
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,180
(will be unveiled here, today.)

423
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,510
All the babies are holding a toy hammer.

424
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,610
Aren't these pictures of us when we were babies?

425
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,810
- That's right.
 -  When we were babies?

426
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,760
Is that boy with two toy hammers you, Jae Seok?

427
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,950
- Your family must have been rich.
 -  No.

428
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,210
No way.

429
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,510
- Those clothes look expensive.
 -  They do.

430
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,680
- Look at those clothes.
 -  They look new.

431
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,080
Those clothes look modern.

432
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,810
Who is this? The one with black top...

433
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,710
- Is this Ji Hyo?
 -  Yes. That's me.

434
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,510
- She looks exotic.
 -  You looked really handsome.

435
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,610
- Who is this naked boy?
 -  Who is it?

436
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,610
Isn't it Joon Gi?

437
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,280
- It's Joon Gi.
 -  Joon Gi. Is it you?

438
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,810
- He is.
 -  Is that Joon Gi?

439
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,010
That's how he looks when he's naked.

440
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,590
Who is that boy next to Jong Kook?

441
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
- He's handsome.
 -  Isn't that Ha Neul?

442
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,880
- It must be Ha Neul.
 -  Yes, it's me.

443
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,310
- It's Ha Neul.
 -  He's so handsome.

444
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,130
- Ha Neul was a handsome boy.
 -  He was fashionable.

445
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,880
- Is that Jong Hyun?
 -  Yes, it's me.

446
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,410
(He looks like a son of a rich family.)

447
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,610
Who's that in the picture from the Korean War era?

448
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,980
- It's even crumpled.
 -  Who's that?

449
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,650
- Is it Seok Jin?
 -  It was hard to find the picture.

450
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,180
- It was you.
 -  Is it from Joseon Dynasty?

451
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,280
I saw that picture in a history book.

452
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,000
You look cuter than I thought.

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,480
It cost about 6 yang.

454
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,080
Welcome, Princes.

455
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,800
Now, a full-fledged war of the emperor's throne will begin.

456
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,840
So toy hammers, the symbol of the R Empire, will be bestowed upon you.

457
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,500
But the 9th and the 10th princes who came later than the others...

458
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,610
should find the toy hammers on their own.

459
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,210
They should find on their own.

460
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,550
There should be some disadvantage like that.

461
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,510
(Joon Gi and Ji Hyo will be our prey then.)

462
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,080
- Okay.
 -  Is this something to applaud?

463
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,110
Of course.

464
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,840
- Your misery is our happiness.
 -  There were lots of people looking.

465
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,610
But seven princes among you...

466
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,610
are very used to a variety of games,

467
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,340
whereas the three of you are less accustomed.

468
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Right, I admit to that.

469
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,280
So I will grant them a special chance.

470
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,380
What will you give them?

471
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,050
- Why do you give them such a thing?
 -  Please don't.

472
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,410
- They're all good.
 -  Jong Hyun is really good.

473
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,470
Jong Hyun is so good at games.

474
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,390
He is the fastest one I've ever seen.

475
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,510
Yes, he is.

476
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,670
- He really is fast.
 -  Right, he's so quick.

477
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,610
Don't you think Seok Jin needs some chances too?

478
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,810
Yes, along with them.

479
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,600
I think it's not fair.

480
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,340
- I should get one.
 -  Give him some money or something.

481
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,810
Money? Why money?

482
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,950
Please do not neglect him.

483
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,280
The emperor's orders have arrived.

484
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,660
The first round will start.

485
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,940
Those who obtain two hearts from the back of the others' heads...

486
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,690
with the hammer will win.

487
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,070
Four winners will face the door of victory...

488
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,970
whereas the rest will go to the door of defeat.

489
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,660
Ji Hyo and Joon Gi should find the hammers on their own.

490
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,080
- They should find the hammers.
 -  They should?

491
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
According to the result of this game, the fate will be...

492
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,110
different between the 4 winners and the 6 losers.

493
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,080
- Really?
 -  They will play different games.

494
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,240
I can already guess who the six losers will be.

495
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,210
- Right.
 -  This will be...

496
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,910
a fight in the mud among the six.

497
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,780
As you said, the losing team will play a game in the mud.

498
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,910
Literally?

499
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,270
The one who ranks last in the losing team...

500
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,050
will be dethroned on the site.

501
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,860
(Will that person be dethroned even before the show ends?)

502
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,380
- Then is that the end for him?
 -  Dethroned?

503
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,050
- It's the end.
 -  Then can he just go home?

504
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,210
- He'll be the dethroned prince.
 -  Does he go home?

505
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,410
- It's the end of him.
 -  Does he go home?

506
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,340
Seok Jin is interested in this.

507
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,690
Can that person go home then?

508
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,750
He won't be able to participate in the final mission.

509
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,980
Will he still be on camera?

510
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,610
The winner...

511
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,880
among the four will receive an advantage that will help him...

512
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,510
in the final game.

513
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,050
We should target Ji Hyo first.

514
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,280
We should send people home.

515
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,580
(The Rebellion of the Hammer)

516
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,550
(They get prepared on separate sites.)

517
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,940
(Seok Jin practises.)

518
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,140
Oh, it works well.

519
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,550
(Kwang Soo practises defending his head.)

520
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,010
I can just avoid getting hit over here.

521
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,310
(The heart falls off.)

522
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,080
I have to be careful of my back.

523
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,090
(He is totally into today's theme.)

524
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,050
Let's go. But wait.

525
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,680
It's not time to put on airs but it's time to find a hammer.

526
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,980
If Kwang Soo finds the hammer first, he might hide it.

527
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,720
(The 10 princes are all ready.)

528
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,050
(The Rebellion of the Hammer begins.)

529
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,580
(Let's get started.)

530
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,580
(Would you like a taste of my hammer?)

531
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,610
Let's go.

532
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,780
(Would you like a taste of my hammer?)

533
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm getting slightly nervous.

534
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,880
I want to be the emperor.

535
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,910
I have to guard my head well.

536
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,580
Going out there empty-handed with a hammer...

537
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,810
is almost like suicide.

538
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,010
(Joon Gi and Ji Hyo need to focus on finding their hammers.)

539
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,840
I don't think they hid them nearby.

540
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,440
(Here comes my prey.)

541
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,440
Do I have to run like this...

542
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,780
without knowing where to go?

543
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Oh my.

544
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,340
(There is no use running without a hammer.)

545
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,910
- You're not attacking me already.
 -  Of course not.

546
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,110
- I need to promote my drama.
 -  Sure.

547
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,940
Let's get Joon Gi.

548
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,840
(Let's get Joon Gi together.)

549
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,780
(All right.)

550
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,680
(Not knowing anything, Joon Gi is busy looking for the hammer.)

551
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,180
(Prince Joon Gi, wait right there.)

552
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Where is he going?

553
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm scared.

554
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,910
(Prince Joon Gi sneaks out casually.)

555
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,510
(We lost him.)

556
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,780
Wait a moment.

557
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,440
- Go first.
 -  Let's go together.

558
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
You need to protect your head too.

559
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't come near me.

560
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,110
(Distrust has now become a habit.)

561
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,980
What's that? There is a box.

562
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,740
Isn't that a box?

563
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
(Ji Hyo has found a hammer.)

564
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,210
I found it.

565
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,810
(She has obtained a hammer.)

566
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,280
- Who's that?
 -  It's Jong Hyun.

567
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
I see. Haha is over there too.

568
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,710
(Ji Hyo hides the hammer from them.)

569
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,980
- Ji Hyo doesn't have...
 -  What, she has already found one.

570
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,710
Without this hammer, my life is in danger.

571
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,510
(Seok Jin meets Kwang Soo.)

572
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,810
What's behind the house?

573
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,840
I don't know if there is a road.

574
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,310
Seok Jin, why don't we hold our hammers upside down?

575
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,180
(Okay. I'll trust you.)

576
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,580
Let's give one heart to each other.

577
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,740
(Seok Jin tries to negotiate.)

578
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,040
Then we just need one heart each.

579
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,980
(That sounds tempting.)

580
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,580
- I'll go first.
 -  You shouldn't go first.

581
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,510
- Then how?
 -  At the same time.

582
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,710
Let's give one each.

583
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,840
In 1, 2, 3.

584
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,340
Hey.

585
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,110
(It looks like the Rebellion of the Fools.)

586
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,740
I knew you would do that.

587
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,980
I feel dizzy.

588
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,110
(They are fools who don't know anything but betrayal.)

589
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,780
(How's Joon Gi doing?)

590
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,040
Gosh, I can't find one.

591
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,360
(He searches around...)

592
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,540
(in vain.)

593
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,740
This must not be the right place.

594
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,840
Where is it?

595
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,510
(He's damaging his own dignity.)

596
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,740
I thought it was a hammer.

597
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,420
Joon Gi is still searching.

598
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,480
Shall we go to him?

599
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,910
- We should get him first.
 -  Let's go.

600
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,540
- Let's go.
 -  Le's go.

601
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,580
He didn't find a hammer yet. Let's go quickly.

602
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,740
Watch out for your backs.

603
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,110
(Haha sneaks behind Gary and surprises him.)

604
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,240
Watch out.

605
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
I'll just smash. I won't look out.

606
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,810
(Haha swings his hammer.)

607
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,540
(You are so annoying.)

608
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,610
Oh my gosh.

609
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,840
Oh, I got it!

610
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,380
He really got it.

611
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,740
(Gary takes one of the hearts.)

612
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,910
I got it.

613
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,110
- Come on.
 -  I got one.

614
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,180
Really?

615
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,020
So why did you fool around?

616
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,960
Gosh, I'm sorry, Haha.

617
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,810
- You don't have to be sorry.
 -  The fight has begun, Gary.

618
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,610
(Prince Gary obtains 1 heart.)

619
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,940
(Realising the power of the hammer, everyone gets nervous.)

620
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,080
The hearts detach easily.

621
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,110
(They intimidate each other.)

622
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,110
(Someone hits Seok Jin from behind.)

623
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,340
(One of his hearts is taken.)

624
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,880
What? You can't do that.

625
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,910
Of course, I can.

626
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,910
I should have watched out for my back.

627
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,030
- What happened to Haha?
 -  He lost one heart.

628
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,110
(Sneaking)

629
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,280
(This is what happened to Haha.)

630
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,610
(It's like this.)

631
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,240
(Boing)

632
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,480
What was that?

633
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,980
Who was that?

634
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,580
It's Kwang Soo, right?

635
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,940
(Prince Kwang Soo also obtains a heart.)

636
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,410
(Now, the hammer battle has officially begun.)

637
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,780
(They attack each other.)

638
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,710
(Haha joins the battle with another heart.)

639
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,580
My hammer burst.

640
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,340
Wait, mine burst.

641
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,170
- Mine's damaged.
 -  I know.

642
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,710
Jae Seok's hammer burst!

643
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,980
It's damaged.

644
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,600
You should've been careful with it.

645
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,710
(They all attack him.)

646
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,780
- I got it!
 -  Oh no.

647
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,380
What...

648
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,610
I said mine burst.

649
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,590
(It's dangerous here. I'd better get moving.)

650
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,190
(He runs away while defending his head.)

651
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,010
(That looks ridiculous.)

652
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,880
(I won't let you take mine.)

653
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,780
(Seok Jin, Haha, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok have one heart each.)

654
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,980
(Joon Gi still hasn't found a hammer.)

655
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,380
It's so hard to find.

656
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,740
(Where on earth is it?)

657
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,040
(I found it!)

658
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,080
Yes!

659
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,880
(Finally, he finds a hammer.)

660
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,080
Now, the time has come.

661
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,440
No one will get out alive.

662
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,610
(With the help of the hammer, he's more into his character.)

663
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,710
(You guys better be prepared.))

664
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,930
(Shall I begin my hunt?)

665
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,340
(Kissing)

666
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,310
They are doomed.

667
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,610
(He swings his hammer.)

668
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,880
(He pretends to be Thor.)

669
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,180
No one will get out alive.

670
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,610
(Princes, watch out for your backs.)

671
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Joon Gi, do you have a hammer?

672
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,480
No, I don't.

673
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,800
- You have one behind your back.
 -  No, I don't.

674
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,180
- Just let me see the hammer.
 -  Ha Neul.

675
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,510
- Joon Gi.
 -  Ha Neul.

676
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,740
Please just show me if you have one.

677
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,710
Let me see your hand.

678
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,080
- Okay?
 -  You saw it, right?

679
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,680
- I'll hate you if you attack me.
 -  Me too.

680
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,810
I won't attack you.

681
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,840
(They make an alliance.)

682
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm very scared.

683
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,740
(Jae Seok comes back with a new hammer.)

684
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,560
- Gosh, you're scary.
 -  Did you get a new hammer?

685
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,980
(Kwang Soo, you jerk.)

686
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,240
You...

687
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,520
How could you gather everyone...

688
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,210
when I had a flat hammer?

689
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,710
- I'm sorry.
 -  How could a human being do that?

690
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,880
How could you?

691
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,610
- Jae Seok, let's get Kwang Soo.
 -  Let's go.

692
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,910
- Let's go.
 -  Ha Neul.

693
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,980
I'll help you.

694
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,710
- Ha Neul, why will you help him?
 -  We promised.

695
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,140
- Think again.
 -  Ha Neul.

696
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,040
- Why would you help him?
 -  Don't listen to Jae Seok.

697
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
- Kwang Soo, let's end here.
 -  Don't listen.

698
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,580
- Otherwise, you may be out.
 -  Think again.

699
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,050
Ha Neul, don't listen.

700
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,820
(I'm in such a dilemma.)

701
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,210
- I never...
 -  You should choose carefully.

702
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,280
I never...

703
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,040
- Why are you stepping back?
 -  I'm not...

704
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,710
- going to attack you.
 -  Okay, okay.

705
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,480
- Aren't you strong, Gary?
 -  I'm weak.

706
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,580
- Why?
 -  He's very fast.

707
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,940
He was very strong in the swimming pool.

708
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,810
(Jong Kook suddenly attacks him.)

709
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,740
(It's suddenly a chaos.)

710
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,440
Goodness, it doesn't fall off easily.

711
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,990
It doesn't fall off.

712
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,610
That was a great attack.

713
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,610
(Haha hits his head.)

714
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,680
(Haha's attack fails.)

715
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,480
Why didn't it fall off?

716
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,180
(At that moment,)

717
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,440
(Haha gets hit.)

718
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,440
(Haha is out.)

719
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,780
What happened? I'm out.

720
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,240
I didn't think someone would come from behind me.

721
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,080
Pointless fights aren't necessary.

722
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,810
- Why don't we...
 -  Let's eliminate Kwang Soo.

723
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,540
- Let's eliminate Kwang Soo.
 -  There are two hearts.

724
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,280
One of the hearts fell off already.

725
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,410
We need to eliminate him.

726
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,210
- He needs to be eliminated.
 -  Let's go.

727
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,080
(Everyone hits Kwang Soo.)

728
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,440
I took one of his off.

729
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,780
- Taking this off is... Okay!
 -  Hey.

730
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,340
(Ha Neul approaches her slowly and hits her hard.)

731
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,410
Yes!

732
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,930
(I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.)

733
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,980
That's it!

734
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,440
Ji Hyo is out.

735
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,910
(Ji Hyo is out.)

736
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,210
Ji Hyo.

737
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,910
I'll keep my eye on you.

738
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,590
I won't go easy on you today.

739
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,940
Ji Hyo is very upset.

740
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,580
(She walks off angrily.)

741
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,870
(Hitting)

742
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,200
- The hearts are gone.
 -  What are you doing?

743
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,060
Why are you eliminating me twice?

744
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,510
(She's already sad to be eliminated.)

745
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,380
(The men start to hit each other.)

746
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,580
What was that?

747
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,110
I think I'm eliminated.

748
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,170
(Seok Jin's counter-attack)

749
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,540
- I did it.
 -  Seok Jin eliminated me.

750
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,040
(Mud, here I come.)

751
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,180
(Haha, Ji Hyo, Jae Seok are out.)

752
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,280
Shouldn't one of the guest members be eliminated?

753
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
Let's eliminate one of the guests.

754
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,940
- Each of them has two hearts.
 -  Really?

755
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,710
(We can't leave them like this.)

756
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,540
Where's the prison?

757
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,010
Where do people go when they're eliminated?

758
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,680
Kwang Soo.

759
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,080
- How many hearts do you have?
 -  I'm already out.

760
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
I'm already out.

761
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,740
(Kwang Soo approaches Prince Jong Hyun's back.)

762
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,810
He's out.

763
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,980
(Now is the time!)

764
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,210
(Kwang Soo hits him.)

765
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,110
(He takes off Jong Hyun's hearts.)

766
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,940
(Kwang Soo's plan was successful.)

767
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,810
You told me you were eliminated. You fooled me.

768
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,410
- You said you were out.
 -  I did it.

769
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,380
I have two hearts.

770
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,610
(The winning team is determined as he takes the first place.)

771
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,410
(They find out Kwang Soo took the first place.)

772
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,610
Where do I go next?

773
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,880
(They start attacking each other again.)

774
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,200
(They hit one another.)

775
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,580
(Hitting)

776
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,740
Goodness.

777
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,840
(Joon Gi obtains Seok Jin's headband by default.)

778
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,690
What's that? I dropped it.

779
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,510
- It doesn't matter.
 -  Does it mean I'm eliminated?

780
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,910
- I am, aren't I?
 -  You were supposed to guard this.

781
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,780
It's a little sly, but this is what it takes to win.

782
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,210
- Come here now.
 -  You are here.

783
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,840
People who are going into the mud were already decided.

784
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,910
That's right.

785
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,610
(He's in high spirits as a winner.)

786
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,450
I'm sorry.

787
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,590
- What did you say?
 -  I'm not in the same boat as you.

788
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,880
- I'm a winner.
 -  You're already?

789
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,310
I won because I took off two hearts.

790
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,190
I'm of a different class now.

791
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,610
I think one of them is already finished here.

792
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,530
(His anger rises.)

793
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,010
Ha Neul, you'll be the main character next.

794
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,330
Let's play a fair fight.

795
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,380
(He gets startled.)

796
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,600
It's Jong Hyun.

797
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,510
(I won't let you attack me.)

798
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,610
(He gets hit.)

799
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,380
(How about this kind of attack?)

800
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,510
(Gary places second and joins the winning team.)

801
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,540
I'm sorry, Joon Gi.

802
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,880
I was just lying down.

803
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,340
(Is this the kind of fun on variety shows?)

804
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,880
Did you lose one heart?

805
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,610
- Let's finish the game.
 -  Okay.

806
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,880
- Joon Gi. Joon Gi.
 -  No.

807
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,280
(It's Jong Hyun versus Ha Neul and Jong Kook versus Joon Gi.)

808
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,180
(Only two of them will join the winning team.)

809
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,940
- Did he stop playing?
 -  It's Gary.

810
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,740
(Ha Neul tries to fool Jong Hyun.)

811
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,480
(However, he fails.)

812
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,110
(You tried to fool me?)

813
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,580
All right, stop it.

814
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,480
(Jong Hyun places third and joins the winning team.)

815
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,780
Oh my goodness.

816
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,460
(Who will win between Jong Kook and Joon Gi?)

817
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,310
Jong Kook, please calm down.

818
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,440
Wait a minute.

819
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,710
(Only one of them can join the winning team.)

820
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,780
(Neither of them can give up.)

821
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,940
(Joon Gi hits him.)

822
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,730
(His hearts are taken off.)

823
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,940
Wait, are you okay?

824
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,140
(It's impossible to fight with strength, so he approaches shyly.)

825
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,740
- I did it.
 -  Did you take them off?

826
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,910
(Prince Joon Gi is the last to join the winning team.)

827
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,980
Okay.

828
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,780
(Prince Joon Gi is the last to join the winning team.)

829
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,040
He's coming. Is he on the losing team?

830
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,590
What's wrong with your clothes?

831
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,540
I was in a fight with a wild animal.

832
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,020
Did you fight with Jong Kook?

833
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,040
I'm an actor, but this show almost became my posthumous work.

834
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,170
That's nonsense.

835
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,540
- Is Jong Kook coming here?
 -  Jong Kook is coming.

836
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,610
- He's one of the winners.
 -  Are you a winner or a loser?

837
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,610
I'm going into the mud.

838
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,980
(Seok Jin, Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Haha, Ha Neul and Jong Kook lost.)

839
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,280
(The winning team celebrates.)

840
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,840
He's going into the mud.

841
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
(However, the losing team will be punished.)

842
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,380
Jong Kook, why did you have to join our team?

843
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,540
- He shouldn't be on our team.
 -  It wasn't my choice.

844
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,040
- We're all old and weak.
 -  Exactly.

845
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,480
(All of them sigh at the same time.)

846
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,810
Princes of the winning team, please move on.

847
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,200
Two princes and two patients, please enter.

848
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,370
- Open sesame!
 -  Open sesame!

849
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,510
(They shout the spell to Sun's Gate.)

850
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,450
- Open sesame!
 -  Open sesame!

851
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,600
(They shout the spell to Moon's Gate.)

852
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,880
Why do you sound so down?

853
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,580
I don't want to go in there because of him.

854
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,040
Come on, let's go.

855
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,080
- Goodness.
 -  Let's go.

856
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,740
(What kind of competition awaits them behind this door?)

857
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,840
(Next is the second round of the Rebellion of the Princes.)

858
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,940
(The winning team arrives after passing through Sun's Gate.)

859
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,680
- Hello. Wow.
 -  Hello.

860
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,040
- The water is clean here.
 -  The air smells fresh.

861
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,410
It looks cool.

862
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,580
It's for the winning team.

863
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,410
(It's a swimming pool for the winning team.)

864
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,410
(What awaits the losing team behind Moon's Gate?)

865
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,610
- Goodness, we have to climb up.
 -  It looks better.

866
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,950
Is that it?

867
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,810
- Is that it?
 -  Goodness.

868
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,980
(It's a mud stage for the losing team.)

869
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,710
(A loud noise)

870
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,850
Here's an order from the emperor.

871
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,380
Princes must receive the order.

872
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,930
Are you going to plot treason again?

873
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,510
No, I won't.

874
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,680
Please read it.

875
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,360
The second round of the Rebellion of the Princes.

876
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,060
- "The Princes' Bows".
 -  Bows?

877
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,950
Grab the arrows in the water and shoot it to knock out the opponent.

878
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,810
The prince to knock out all the toys with others' names attached wins.

879
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,610
The winner will obtain the imperial secret weapon.

880
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,540
Haven't you done archery before?

881
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,080
- No.
 -  No.

882
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,020
- I can't shoot arrows at all.
 -  I'm sure you did in the drama.

883
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,240
No, I've never done it.

884
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,710
(Is this playing darts, then?)

885
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,220
You did it in the recent drama.

886
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,580
- Come on.
 -  I didn't.

887
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,280
I won't have a chance against them.

888
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,980
The prince whose toy remains until the end wins.

889
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,010
Aim the toys with other people's names.

890
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,540
You can only shoot the arrow on the buoy.

891
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,610
- This looks fun.
 -  Why must we cheer for them?

892
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,340
- Gosh.
 -  We're only watching the game.

893
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,610
Goodness.

894
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,610
- We don't have to cheer.
 -  No, you don't.

895
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,410
It's that jingle.

896
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,340
(This stop is Imperial Station. The exit is on your left.)

897
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,280
- What is it?
 -  I've never heard of it before.

898
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,740
(This stop is Imperial Station. The exit is on your left.)

899
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,080
When do we start?

900
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,200
(It's a Korean traditional music show.)

901
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,380
(The music stops.)

902
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,110
("The Princes' Bows" starts.)

903
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,910
(He runs hurriedly.)

904
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,010
Here it is.

905
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,210
(Kwang Soo is the quickest.)

906
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,240
(The bow bounces off.)

907
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,340
(Move out the way.)

908
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,410
(I must hurry up to survive.)

909
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,610
- This is too hard.
 -  There's only one.

910
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,840
(The arrow is stuck.)

911
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,770
He's in a hurry.

912
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,400
- Goodness.
 -  Why doesn't it work?

913
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,080
(I've shot arrows before.)

914
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,740
(He shoots his own toy.)

915
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,710
- Wait.
 -  That was yours.

916
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,340
He shot his own toy.

917
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,950
Jong Hyun is good.

918
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,210
(Here I go.)

919
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,080
(He shoots Joon Gi.)

920
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,910
Joon Gi's toy got knocked down.

921
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,540
Let's go again.

922
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,950
(Here I go.)

923
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,110
Block him.

924
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,080
Why are you so bad at shooting, Gary?

925
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,540
The arrow doesn't fit my bow.

926
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,840
(Kwang Soo is annoyed.)

927
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,080
Bring the sword.

928
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,210
(Bring the sword.)

929
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,310
It's okay.

930
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,710
- Jong Hyun is good.
 -  Jong Hyun is shooting well.

931
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,610
(He's doing it for real this time.)

932
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,740
Please hit the target.

933
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,610
Please hit the target.

934
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,610
(His arrow hits the target.)

935
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,220
Please hit the target.

936
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,810
He hit Gary. Jong Hyun is good at archery.

937
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,510
(One of Jong Hyun, Joon Gi and Gary's toys are knocked down.)

938
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,480
(It's my turn now.)

939
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,510
(Screaming)

940
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,540
How will they know which one they shot?

941
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
It hit Jong Hyun's.

942
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,450
(Kwang Soo shoots his own.)

943
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,680
(One of Kwang Soo's toys is shot.)

944
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,980
- I'm sorry.
 -  It was Kwang Soo.

945
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,040
(Watch this!)

946
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,740
Bring the sword.

947
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,880
(He hits Kwang Soo's toy.)

948
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,610
Why is Jong Hyun so good?

949
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,010
Kwang Soo is out if someone shoots his toy.

950
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,470
(Kwang Soo has only one toy left.)

951
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,180
Stop shooting at mine!

952
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,280
- He missed it.
 -  Stop shooting at mine!

953
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,110
- Let me shoot one more time.
 -  Okay.

954
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,210
(He shoots at Gary's toy.)

955
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,710
- I'll kill him.
 -  Why are there so many?

956
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,110
- Joon Gi...
 -  Gosh!

957
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,810
(Gary hits his own toy.)

958
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,080
(What's wrong with me today?)

959
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,010
- Gary is totally out.
 -  Okay!

960
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,510
- It's called self-destruction.
 -  Gary is out!

961
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,710
(Prince Gary is out.)

962
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,110
(Joon Gi lies down to shoot.)

963
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,580
(He lies down and shoots an arrow.)

964
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,510
Look at him. He makes it.

965
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,140
Joon Gi cares about his looks too much.

966
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,340
Are you doing equestrian martial arts?

967
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,180
(Joon Gi has become Cupid.)

968
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,480
(Ladies, would you gladly accept my arrows?)

969
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm the prince of the R Empire.

970
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,480
(He aims to capture the ladies' hearts.)

971
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,310
My goodness.

972
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,950
(This is how you should do in Running Man.)

973
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
(The arrow touches Joon Gi's toy.)

974
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,040
It's falling back.

975
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,540
(The arrow slightly touches the toy...)

976
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
(and the toy falls down.)

977
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,810
- Yes!
 -  He made it.

978
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,110
Wait.

979
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,140
Joon Gi needs to make it just one more time.

980
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,740
(Here are the remaining toys.)

981
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,450
(His bowstring is broken.)

982
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,680
(Prince Kwang Soo even breaks his bowstring.)

983
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
- Let's go for it.
 -  Go!

984
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,010
He's so good.

985
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,010
Kwang Soo, it serves you right.

986
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,010
(Prince Kwang Soo is out.)

987
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,110
I will win this round!

988
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,540
(If he hits the toy first, he wins.)

989
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,680
(It's either Joon Gi or Jong Hyun.)

990
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Jong Hyun.

991
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,680
I envy him. He's a handsome and talented archer.

992
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,450
Without Gary and Kwang Soo, it looks great.

993
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,610
I feel like I'm watching a drama.

994
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,210
(This is such a great scene to look at.)

995
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,520
(It's more than beautiful that they're together.)

996
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,480
It's good to see them together.

997
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,710
(Now, it's time to shoot my arrow.)

998
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,210
(He hits his own toy.)

999
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,480
(Here is another self-destruction.)

1000
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,950
(No way!)

1001
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,410
- Gosh.
 -  Okay!

1002
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,580
(Jong Hyun wins The Princes' Bows.)

1003
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,040
Wait. I will make an incantation.

1004
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,810
(He's about to open his card.)

1005
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,040
(Prince Joon Gi received a special card.)

1006
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,610
- What is it?
 -  Is it the time travelling chant?

1007
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,480
Fix my hammer first.

1008
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,710
The time has come.

1009
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,510
- Why is he so phony?
 -  "The time has come"?

1010
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,340
The sun and the moon!

1011
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,610
Set time free!

1012
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,040
It's no different to the time travelling chant.

1013
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
(I look better.)

1014
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,040
There he goes again.

1015
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,910
He re-winded time.

1016
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,610
(He winds time backwards.)

1017
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,540
(Will Jong Hyun, the talented archer, win?)

1018
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,840
(Or will Joon Gi be able to make a different result?)

1019
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,610
I'll put an end to this now.

1020
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,340
(Jong Hyun hits his own toy.)

1021
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
That was dangerous.

1022
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,410
(Joon Gi hits Jong Hyun's.)

1023
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,610
(Everyone's so focused.)

1024
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,980
Move to the left.

1025
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,610
(Jong Hyun hits both toys.)

1026
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,910
(It's very fierce.)

1027
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,310
How is Jong Hyun so good?

1028
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
It's like the Olympics.

1029
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,140
(Who...)

1030
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,540
(will become the final winner?)

1031
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,010
(Jong Hyun shoots the arrow.)

1032
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,840
(He hits Joon Gi's toy.)

1033
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,740
(Prince Jong Hyun wins The Princes' Bows.)

1034
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,740
Wow, Jong Hyun.

1035
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,010
(What a bowman!)

1036
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,710
Wow, he's an excellent archer.

1037
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,280
Let's go to the mud pit.

1038
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,710
(Jong Hyun wins and obtains a chance card.)

1039
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,210
(Jong Hyun earns a chance card.)

1040
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,740
(Now, it's the losing team's Consolation Game.)

1041
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
It's time for the "Consolation Game".

1042
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,240
"Those who lost really disappointed me."

1043
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,450
"If you lose in this round, you'll never be able to hold the throne."

1044
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,450
(We must avoid dethronement.)

1045
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,840
(They'll fight in a mud pit to avoid dethronement.)

1046
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,610
Ha Neul, don't forget to make us laugh even if you lose.

1047
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,450
(Ha Neul's pressured.)

1048
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,210
Start when I say so.

1049
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,680
Are you guys planning something?

1050
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,950
Stop planning things out.

1051
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,310
- We weren't.
 -  They were just talking.

1052
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,740
(Those left in the mud 30 seconds after the music starts will lose.)

1053
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,680
(I will make you lose your mind with my modern dance.)

1054
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,740
That's a nice collaboration.

1055
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,610
- You must compete!
 -  Or you'll lose.

1056
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,120
Go fight!

1057
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,840
- You should do your best.
 -  Go for it!

1058
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,540
(They're watching for a good chance.)

1059
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,950
What if all of them win this round?

1060
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,330
30 seconds is too short.

1061
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,180
What are they doing?

1062
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,260
Only one person gets to lose. Think wisely.

1063
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,310
Everyone...

1064
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,210
Let's go.

1065
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,910
(They start the fight.)

1066
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,810
Please move.

1067
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,810
(Everyone, go down to the mud pit.)

1068
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,580
Wait, push him.

1069
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
- 10 seconds!
 -  Please.

1070
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,950
Haha, you can do it.

1071
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,610
- I can make it.
 -  Don't push me.

1072
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,710
- You can't do it.
 -  Do not push me!

1073
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,250
- Hold him.
 -  Wait.

1074
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,480
- Look at them.
 -  Wait!

1075
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,520
- Wait!
 -  20 seconds left!

1076
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,710
Wait! Wait!

1077
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,740
(Two members fall into the mud.)

1078
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,950
(They're Prince Seok Jin and Prince Haha.)

1079
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,950
Hey!

1080
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,710
(Haha grabs Ha Neul tightly.)

1081
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,900
(Prince Ha Neul, we need to cling onto you.)

1082
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,210
We must push him down.

1083
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,440
(Let me go up.)

1084
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,840
(I want to avoid dethronement desperately.)

1085
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,080
(Seok Jin falls into the mud.)

1086
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,910
(The first round is over.)

1087
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,060
We made it.

1088
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,110
Am I out?

1089
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,610
Let's get ready.

1090
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,910
The four princes have survived.

1091
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,940
I made it!

1092
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,510
- This is so funny.
 -  Ha Neul.

1093
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,690
Ha Neul!

1094
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,810
- Ha Neul, are you all right?
 -  I survived!

1095
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,010
How could this happen?

1096
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,340
Why is it Seok Jin again?

1097
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,140
Why did they target us?

1098
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,070
You'll have the last round.

1099
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,310
Now, this is the real fight.

1100
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,430
- Gosh.
 -  It will be so fun.

1101
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,900
- This will be a fun fight.
 -  This is real.

1102
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,210
- If you lose...
 -  Right.

1103
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:19,450
(Who will win this round?)

1104
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,060
I never expected this round.

1105
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,940
- Right.
 -  This is the main part.

1106
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,810
(It won't be easy, Prince Haha.)

1107
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,440
(That's for me to say.)

1108
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,740
(We fear nothing when we fight together.)

1109
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,840
(The last round between Seok Jin and Haha begins.)

1110
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,340
I can't bear to watch them.

1111
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,910
You must go up.

1112
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,410
(They both fall down.)

1113
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,740
(Thanks to the mud, we'll at least have great skin.)

1114
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,010
- No!
 -  20 seconds left!

1115
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
(What a fierce fight it is.)

1116
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,740
(Who will be the one to leave?)

1117
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,110
- Go up.
 -  You should go up.

1118
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,140
Ten!

1119
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,280
(Seok Jin falls.)

1120
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,910
(Haha trips him and gets the chance to win.)

1121
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,440
(But Seok Jin pulls him down.)

1122
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,110
Go up!

1123
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,480
(Seok Jin grabs Haha's shirt.)

1124
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,810
(They have less than 10 seconds.)

1125
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,310
(Prince Seok Jin gets a chance this time.)

1126
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,580
(He tries to jump,)

1127
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,040
(but fails.)

1128
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,740
(How can a man that bad at jumping?)

1129
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,210
He failed to climb up.

1130
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,730
Who will become the loser?

1131
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,340
This is a really funny fight.

1132
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,190
(The first round is over.)

1133
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,210
I failed to jump.

1134
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,320
Go for it! Do it again!

1135
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,740
This is so funny.

1136
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,810
Everyone,

1137
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,410
you will start on the platform.

1138
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,340
The one who falls first loses.

1139
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,340
That will be the rules.

1140
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,520
- Okay.
 -  That's a good idea.

1141
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,540
You can do it!

1142
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,340
(Are you there, Seok Jin?)

1143
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,440
(Yes, I'm here and you're there.)

1144
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,140
(When this round is over, one of them will no longer be a prince.)

1145
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,530
- Push him hard.
 -  Push him.

1146
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,540
- Okay.
 -  You made it!

1147
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,310
(Go down!)

1148
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,310
(Haha uses force on Seok Jin.)

1149
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,180
- Okay.
 -  Good job.

1150
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,710
(Are they playing ssireum now?)

1151
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,540
- This is so fun!
 -  It is.

1152
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,240
- This is really funny.
 -  Goodness.

1153
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,740
(Seok Jin is struggling.)

1154
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,810
- What are they doing?
 -  Are they wrestling?

1155
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,910
(He even uses his facial muscles.)

1156
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,940
This is like the Olympics.

1157
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,680
Go for it!

1158
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,180
You can do it.

1159
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,910
- Great. That's it.
 -  You can do it.

1160
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,280
(Their match impresses us the way Park Sang Young did.)

1161
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,910
(I can do it. I can dethrone him.)

1162
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,580
I don't know why this is so moving.

1163
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,580
Why are you so heavy?

1164
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,310
This is a close game.

1165
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,210
- You're so tenacious.
 -  I'm so tired.

1166
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,450
They're exhausted.

1167
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,710
- They're both winners today.
 -  You guys look great!

1168
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,380
You're really strong.

1169
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,340
- You were tenacious.
 -  This is so touching.

1170
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,340
Goodness.

1171
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,940
- He's moving.
 -  You're very strong!

1172
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,340
(Let's play fair and square.)

1173
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,810
(Haha grabs a forbidden area.)

1174
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,240
Haha, you can't do that.

1175
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,440
It hurts! Seriously!

1176
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,540
What is he doing?

1177
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,120
(Their dirty fight commences.)

1178
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,610
Haha, push him with your legs!

1179
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
(Prince Seok Jin falls into the mud.)

1180
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,990
- You must go up to the platform.
 -  He won.

1181
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,080
(The round is over and Prince Haha wins.)

1182
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,070
The ending was funny.

1183
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,540
He's the true winner today.

1184
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,570
You're irritating him even more.

1185
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,940
You also did a good job.

1186
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,220
Since Prince Seok Jin...

1187
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,190
failed to win the round, he's dethroned.

1188
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,210
Be quiet!

1189
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,010
(Prince Seok Jin is dethroned.)

1190
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,610
(The final round awaits the princes.)

1191
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,410
(This is the final place.)

1192
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,710
Prince Seok Jin.

1193
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,200
What do you mean? He's no longer a prince.

1194
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,310
Actually, dethroned princes usually...

1195
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,940
enjoy the rest of their lives.

1196
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,240
Aren't they sent into exile?

1197
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,930
Since Seok Jin is dethroned, let him fill the time.

1198
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:05,980
Hey.

1199
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,330
What's he got to do anyway?

1200
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,440
Dethroned prince has a different task.

1201
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,840
- I see.
 -  He must have another role.

1202
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,680
You shouldn't have revealed that.

1203
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,210
Maybe it's something important.

1204
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,340
- Well...
 -  Here comes the scroll.

1205
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,990
Stop throwing things at us.

1206
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,010
(He has no manners.)

1207
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,970
- How could you miss that?
 -  Throw it nicely.

1208
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,610
(Let's give it another try.)

1209
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,460
Catch it. Show us what you've got.

1210
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,840
(He is serious.)

1211
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,080
- Gosh.
 -  What should we do?

1212
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,740
Joon Gi.

1213
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,340
(You are an utter disgrace.)

1214
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,440
He failed.

1215
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,890
- But it's hard to catch.
 -  Stop acting foolish.

1216
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,500
Maybe he wants more attention.

1217
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,680
Let's just start.

1218
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,740
Joon Gi, show us what you've got.

1219
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,440
(He gives it another try and succeeds.)

1220
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,720
(Joon Gi, what a nice catch.)

1221
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,560
But you know what? They'll air the part you failed.

1222
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,010
You mean they'll air the part I failed?

1223
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,380
(Please edit the film nicely for me.)

1224
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,710
Who will sit on the throne?

1225
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,210
The final race to determine the one to take the throne will start.

1226
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,740
- The final race.
 -  It's the last race.

1227
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,980
(So this is the final race.)

1228
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,050
To take the throne, you need to offer two name tags of others.

1229
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,590
- It's going to be hard.
 -  Two name tags?

1230
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,540
You can rip the name tag in person,

1231
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,840
but there's another secret method only passed on to the princes.

1232
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,880
What would that be?

1233
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,610
Find the emperor's cushion that will appear randomly.

1234
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,880
Sit on it and chant the spell with a name and hold for three minutes.

1235
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,410
Then, you'll obtain the person's name tag.

1236
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,810
(If you manage to stay seated for three minutes, you'll gain the tag.)

1237
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,110
You want us to stay on it for three minutes?

1238
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,480
If someone uses a cushion once, you cannot reuse the same cushion.

1239
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:39,340
Remember. You must stay on the moon while you hold out.

1240
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,440
(This isn't going to be easy.)

1241
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,450
We should prevent others from getting two name tags.

1242
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,590
Let's say I'm on the cushion.

1243
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,240
What happens if someone kicks me and I fall off from it?

1244
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,610
The cushion is going to be on the moon which is a little bigger.

1245
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,140
If you go off the moon, it'll no longer be effective.

1246
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,410
- I can rip it off by hand, right?
 -  Of course.

1247
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,610
Oh, you mean that's also possible.

1248
00:49:58,610 --> 00:49:59,980
It's going to be a busy day.

1249
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,180
(I'm sure we'll be running everywhere.)

1250
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,010
Can we rip off the name tag of the person who's on the cushion?

1251
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,540
Yes, you can rip it off even if the person is on the cushion.

1252
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,580
(The answer is yes.)

1253
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,530
Does that mean I have to defend my name tag for three minutes?

1254
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,440
If three minutes pass, you can eliminate the person you called.

1255
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,340
Can we move the cushion from its place,

1256
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,880
instead of sitting on it?

1257
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,110
There'll be a moon on the floor which is bigger than the cushion.

1258
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,680
Three minutes must pass while the cushion is on the moon.

1259
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,980
You mean we can eliminate the person even if he's on it?

1260
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,540
You'll be eliminated if your name tag is ripped off,

1261
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,940
- and if you're off the zone.
 -  We've gone over this a minute ago.

1262
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,540
Can we take off the name tag of the person who is on the cushion?

1263
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,110
We repeated this three times already.

1264
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,610
How many cushions are there?

1265
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,980
He said, it will appear one at a time, randomly.

1266
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,980
- One by one...
 -  You should read this again.

1267
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,740
- One by one, Ji Hyo.
 -  Will you please read this again?

1268
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,160
You'll be able to find out when it is broadcast.

1269
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,710
How many times do we have to repeat the same thing?

1270
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,840
Pass the Gate of Total Eclipse,

1271
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,110
and you'll be led to the final race.

1272
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,080
But before that, we have something for Prince Jong Hyun.

1273
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,310
- Yes, he has an advantage.
 -  What is it?

1274
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,240
- He won a mission.
 -  Yes, he did.

1275
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,010
- He must have an advantage.
 -  Really?

1276
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,410
That may give him power to summon the cushion.

1277
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,880
(What could this advantage be?)

1278
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,010
- What can it be?
 -  Jong Hyun does have an advantage.

1279
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,110
Jong Hyun, I hope for your victory.

1280
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,040
Take the throne.

1281
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,810
Get ready.

1282
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,110
We'll start the final round.

1283
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,610
- Let's go inside.
 -  What about me?

1284
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,440
- You can't enter. I'll explain.
 -  So I'm not allowed to enter?

1285
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,600
(Nine princes, come through the Gate of Total Eclipse.)

1286
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,130
(But only one will take the throne.)

1287
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:41,280
(Who will be the prince to sit on the throne?)

1288
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,480
(The final match will be held in this building.)

1289
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,510
I'm going to win.

1290
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,210
It's all mine. I'm going to have it all.

1291
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,140
All I need is two name tags, right?

1292
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,610
First, I'll team up with Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

1293
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,940
And eliminate everyone we meet on the way to find the cushion.

1294
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,480
I think I'll be eliminated soon.

1295
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,980
I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to be eliminated soon.

1296
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,980
If Jong Hyun's advantage is reversing the effect,

1297
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,210
I'm sure he'll try to attack me.

1298
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,010
I should use this to save myself rather than to eliminate someone.

1299
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,140
(What would be the chance card that Jong Hyun has?)

1300
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,180
(Nine princes, prepare yourselves for the final match.)

1301
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,160
Microphone testing.

1302
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,180
Gosh, it scared me.

1303
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,410
The game is about to start.

1304
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,480
It's Seok Jin.

1305
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,710
So that must be his role.

1306
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,610
I'm the voice from the sky.

1307
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,940
The race will start in a minute.

1308
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,080
(Laughing)

1309
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,410
(His tone is so awkward.)

1310
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,010
I can tell he is a first-timer.

1311
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,910
I hope no one else but us is listening to this.

1312
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,840
I hope no one else is listening. This is so embarrassing.

1313
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,880
I apologise.

1314
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,670
(I apologise on behalf of him.)

1315
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,910
What's he doing? There are people working here.

1316
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,320
(Seok Jin is being frivolous.)

1317
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,390
(Laughing)

1318
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,080
So is he like the spirit of mountain?

1319
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,210
The final round is about to start.

1320
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,840
Prepare yourselves, nine princes.

1321
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,280
Who would be the one to take the throne?

1322
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,310
Five,

1323
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,740
four,

1324
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,240
three,

1325
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,780
two,

1326
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,310
one.

1327
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,180
The game starts now.

1328
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,580
Can I go now?

1329
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,580
(It's time for the final match.)

1330
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,680
Let's go find them.

1331
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,380
Hiding is not always a good thing,

1332
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,260
because someone else can get two name tags first.

1333
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,040
The best strategy is to find the cushion.

1334
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,880
Someone's coming.

1335
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,610
(Running)

1336
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:55,140
(Who are you?)

1337
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,180
I think someone's there.

1338
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Who is that?

1339
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,610
(Running)

1340
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,180
(Let's charge forward.)

1341
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,610
- Joon Gi, it's you.
 -  Jae Seok.

1342
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,590
- Can you give me some advice?
 -  What kind of advice?

1343
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,840
Just run. That's all.

1344
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,140
I see. Jae Seok, will you help me?

1345
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,380
- I know you're good.
 -  Me?

1346
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,580
- Well, later...
 -  Yes.

1347
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,210
Well... We need to look into each other first.

1348
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,240
- Someone's coming.
 -  Really? Where?

1349
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,550
- There she comes.
 -  It's Ji Hyo.

1350
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,870
- It's useless if Jong Kook appears.
 -  That's what I mean.

1351
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,280
We need to find the cushion before he shows up.

1352
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,810
- I think that's what's important.
 -  Yes, that's important.

1353
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,680
- Joon Gi, you need to think hard.
 -  We need to eliminate him first.

1354
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,130
I've no intention of attacking you. I'm here for some advice.

1355
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,210
- Then, let's go find the cushion.
 -  Let's find it.

1356
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,910
- Let's go find the cushion.
 -  Okay.

1357
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,210
- Are we allies now?
 -  What I mean is...

1358
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,930
Ji Hyo, who's that over there?

1359
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,300
Jong Hyun, we are trying to find the cushion to eliminate Jong Kook.

1360
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,610
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1361
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,810
That's a good idea.

1362
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,510
- Hello.
 -  Ha Neul,

1363
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,240
- go find the cushion first.
 -  All right.

1364
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,910
Let's find the cushion and eliminate Jong Kook first.

1365
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,210
You mean we should eliminate Jong Kook?

1366
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,380
Jong Kook is over there.

1367
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,410
(Jong Kook alarm is issued.)

1368
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,510
Ji Hyo, hurry.

1369
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,240
Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

1370
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,080
(Roar)

1371
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,110
Jae Seok,

1372
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,980
it's fine.

1373
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,880
- Ji Hyo, hurry.
 -  We should hurry.

1374
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,650
(It's an emergency. Evacuate.)

1375
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,270
- Shall we go for it now?
 -  Shall we?

1376
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,110
- We should eliminate them.
 -  You are very intuitive.

1377
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,770
(Let's go and hide.)

1378
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,010
- It's Jong Kook.
 -  Jong Kook teamed up with Haha.

1379
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,310
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1380
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,440
- This is a dead end.
 -  This way, Ji Hyo.

1381
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,840
I already know your strategies.

1382
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,680
(It won't be easy for you.)

1383
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I have an important information.

1384
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,610
What is it?

1385
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,410
The cushion has appeared.

1386
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,910
(The cushion has appeared.)

1387
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,710
The cushion is on the ground floor of the main building.

1388
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,540
(Ground floor of the main building?)

1389
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,490
- On the ground floor?
 -  Let's move. Hurry.

1390
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,130
He said it's on the ground floor of the main building.

1391
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,040
It's on the ground floor of the main building.

1392
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,880
- Where is that?
 -  Let me repeat.

1393
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,200
The cushion is at the main building, on the ground floor.

1394
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,880
Ground floor of the main building? Hold on. This is the annexe.

1395
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,610
I thought this was the annex. Is this the main building?

1396
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,680
(Ground floor of the main building)

1397
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:21,380
(The cushion is waiting for you.)

1398
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,780
(Princes, hurry up!)

1399
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,510
- Let's cooperate until we find it.
 -  Okay.

1400
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,580
Be careful.

1401
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,880
(Joon Gi arrives first.)

1402
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,610
(Running)

1403
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,780
(What?)

1404
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,790
(Kwang Soo arrives second.)

1405
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,740
- Did you just get here?
 -  Kwang Soo, I just heard...

1406
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,240
(Where will it be?)

1407
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,940
(It's here.)

1408
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,480
that the cushion appeared.

1409
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,410
(Whoever is faster will get the cushion.)

1410
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,040
(Kwang Soo sits on the cushion first.)

1411
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,010
(Now, Kwang Soo has the power to eliminate one of the princes.)

1412
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,510
(What should I do now?)

1413
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,990
Hurry. We'll guard you. Name someone who's not here.

1414
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,280
- Whom should I eliminate?
 -  Hurry up.

1415
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,270
- Choose someone who isn't here.
 -  I'm here.

1416
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,080
- Jae Seok.
 -  Call Jae Seok. Hurry.

1417
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,340
Hong Jong Hyun, Hong Jong Hyun.

1418
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,940
- Hurry.
 -  Jong Hyun is here.

1419
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,740
Jong Hyun is here.

1420
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,110
(The princes are gathering around the cushion.)

1421
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,180
We'll help you.

1422
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,440
(What am I supposed to do?)

1423
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,480
Hey, call out someone who's not here.

1424
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,310
What is he doing on the floor?

1425
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:44,110
(Jae Seok and Ha Neul are observing the situation closely.)

1426
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,510
Everybody's here.

1427
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,110
(Kwang Soo can't make up his mind.)

1428
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,510
(Will he eliminate the strongest member, Jong Kook?)

1429
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,040
(Or will he eliminate Jong Hyun with a chance card?)

1430
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,610
(Who will Kwang Soo choose to eliminate?)

1431
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,780
The third prince Gary will...

1432
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,940
(Oh my.)

1433
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,180
be dethroned from his position.

1434
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,080
He won't be able to become the emperor!

1435
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,540
Why me?

1436
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,710
Why is it me?

1437
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,330
You're the only one who's not here.

1438
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,610
(That was a great move, Prince Kwang Soo!)

1439
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,880
Everyone is near me except you.

1440
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
Why is it me? He must be out of his mind.

1441
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,310
- We have to block him.
 -  We should block him.

1442
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,780
Let's block him.

1443
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,240
(The members plan to intercept Gary.)

1444
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,110
But why is it me?

1445
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,240
You were the only one that wasn't here.

1446
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,840
I was up there!

1447
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,980
(Gary must get Kwang Soo off of the cushion.)

1448
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,180
Block him for me.

1449
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,610
Get closer.

1450
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,980
(We'll show you what defence is.)

1451
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,410
Why is it me?

1452
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,480
- Everyone else was here.
 -  Why me?

1453
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,080
Everyone was here except you.

1454
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,610
(Now is the time.)

1455
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,740
(Don't you dare.)

1456
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,480
Gary.

1457
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,110
(Joon Gi makes a sudden attack.)

1458
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,040
At least give me a try.

1459
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,840
I'm sorry, Gary. We have no choice.

1460
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,480
(He moves quickly.)

1461
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,580
(They're playing tight defence.)

1462
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,580
Look at him.

1463
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,280
Look at him.

1464
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,280
(These will be your last moments, Gary.)

1465
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,510
How much time is left?

1466
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,110
Take him out.

1467
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,040
(Gary has 1 minute and 30 seconds left.)

1468
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,440
(Goodness)

1469
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,410
(Gary loses his balance and gets encircled.)

1470
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,460
- Let's hold him like this.
 -  No!

1471
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,940
(I just need to hang on a bit longer.)

1472
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:38,310
(Thanks to Kwang Soo's attack, will Gary be out?)

1473
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,780
Goodness, no.

1474
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,580
(Gary grabs onto Haha's tag.)

1475
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,510
No, no!

1476
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,880
No, you can't!

1477
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,570
(I'll save you, Haha.)

1478
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,310
Hurry.

1479
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,970
- Cover him.
 -  Hey, hey.

1480
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,980
(Is that Haha's name tag in Kwang Soo's hands?)

1481
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,280
No, you can't!

1482
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,040
(Kwang Soo betrays Haha.)

1483
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,280
Kwang Soo!

1484
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,510
Cover my tag. Hey, Kwang Soo!

1485
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,720
- Okay!
 -  Kwang Soo ripped mine.

1486
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,580
Kwang Soo ripped mine.

1487
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,920
- Get Kwang Soo out.
 -  I just have to hold out.

1488
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,670
- No!
 -  We have to get Kwang Soo out.

1489
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,510
- Get Kwang Soo out.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1490
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,410
- He ripped mine.
 -  He'll have two name tags.

1491
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,980
We have to get him out or else, he'll have two name tags.

1492
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,610
(In that case, let's get him out.)

1493
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,240
Wait, I'll go out! I'll go out! I'm out!

1494
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,010
(Kwang Soo quickly gives in.)

1495
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:30,000
I'm out! I'm out!

1496
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,910
- Wait.
 -  Get him!

1497
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,080
- Wait! Hold on!
 -  Joon Gi, hurry and rip his tag!

1498
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,110
(I've come to get Kwang Soo.)

1499
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,180
Rip it, quickly.

1500
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,710
I'm out!

1501
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,580
(Kwang Soo, this is the price you pay for betraying.)

1502
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,940
- Get him then.
 -  Gary ripped the tag!

1503
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,610
Guys! I got off the cushion a long time ago!

1504
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,310
(Ripping)

1505
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,410
(Jae Seok makes a quick attack.)

1506
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,410
(Joon Gi is out.)

1507
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,910
I'm sorry, Joon Gi.

1508
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,690
I couldn't help it.

1509
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,140
- Jae Seok!
 -  I'm sorry, Joon Gi.

1510
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,380
(Haha and Joon Gi are out.)

1511
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,240
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo have two tags.)

1512
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,520
(What will the members do with Kwang Soo?)

1513
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,040
- What do we do?
 -  Don't trust him.

1514
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,210
Let's rip Kwang Soo first.

1515
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,580
I don't have the desire to attack any more. I only have one tag.

1516
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,370
- I'm on your side, Jong Kook.
 -  We have to eliminate him.

1517
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,810
I'm so angry. I can't believe you, Kwang Soo.

1518
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,480
(His betraying instincts can't be ignored.)

1519
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,010
I gave my all to help him.

1520
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,710
I feel sorry to Joon Gi.

1521
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,910
(Jae Seok starts to feel guilty.)

1522
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,240
Whatever.

1523
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,140
I can't trust Jae Seok.

1524
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,880
He suggested joining hands before.

1525
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,710
Can the top host of Korea act like this?

1526
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,780
Gosh, I'll complain about this on the show's website.

1527
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,300
(I'm going to tell on you, Jae Seok.)

1528
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,710
Get up now.

1529
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,360
Get up, Kwang Soo.

1530
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,140
Do you really have to get me, Jong Hyun?

1531
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,810
Jong Kook, I was on your side from the beginning.

1532
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,340
Why'd you rip Haha?

1533
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,610
Gary ripped most of Haha's tag.

1534
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,700
Goodness, you got blinded by your greed to win again.

1535
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,740
They tried so hard to protect you.

1536
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,240
(Gary barely ran away.)

1537
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,540
(Let me catch my breath.)

1538
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,180
(Oh my gosh.)

1539
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,110
(He's nervous. It shows that he's a rookie.)

1540
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,310
(Ha Neul is over there.)

1541
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,080
(Shall I go for a hunt?)

1542
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,110
(Attacking)

1543
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:43,110
(Ha Neul quickly positions himself for an attack.)

1544
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,230
Ha Neul.

1545
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,250
It's nothing, Gary. That wasn't anything.

1546
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,610
(You've improved, Ha Neul.)

1547
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,110
(Ha Neul's attention is elsewhere.)

1548
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,910
(I will show you the true skill of name tag ripping.)

1549
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,310
(Ripping)

1550
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,440
(Ha Neul is out.)

1551
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:11,510
This is how you play the game, Ha Neul.

1552
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,260
I'm sorry.

1553
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,540
This is how you rip name tags.

1554
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,020
I'm sorry.

1555
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,610
(Hello, there.)

1556
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,710
(Jong Kook makes a surprise attack.)

1557
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,210
No! What is this?

1558
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,410
Gary.

1559
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,310
(You should practise a bit more, Gary.)

1560
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,910
Hey, Gary. So this name tag game...

1561
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,080
This is how you play Name Tag Elimination.

1562
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,220
I'm so mad. I'm embarrassed. Go away!

1563
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,180
Go away! I'm embarrassed.

1564
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,510
This is my most embarrassing moment ever.

1565
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,080
(This is my most embarrassing moment in Running Man's history.)

1566
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:55,780
(Ha Neul and Gary are out. Jong Kook has two name tags.)

1567
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,040
Here they come.

1568
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,080
(What are the people in jail doing?)

1569
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,180
- Is Jong Hyun our last hope?
 -  Oh my goodness.

1570
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,040
Why did I win the mud fight?

1571
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,480
Don't join hands with anyone, Haha.

1572
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,370
I really trusted Kwang Soo this time.

1573
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:11,810
You'll get betrayed.

1574
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,480
- Honestly...
 -  Kwang Soo is out.

1575
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,810
Kwang Soo is out.

1576
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,110
(Serves him right.)

1577
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,710
(Kwang Soo was cornered by Jong Hyun and Ji Hyo.)

1578
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,580
I got it.

1579
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,660
I got it. Kwang Soo is out.

1580
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:34,580
(Why did you betray if you were going to get out like this?)

1581
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,840
(Trudging)

1582
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:40,940
You dirty fool!

1583
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,080
(It's an angry water slap.)

1584
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,340
- Dirty fool!
 -  I'm sorry.

1585
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,680
I have nothing to say. I apologise.

1586
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,180
- You're horrible.
 -  I'm sorry.

1587
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,780
I should've shown you a better side of me. I'm sorry.

1588
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,130
But really, how could you do that?

1589
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,610
It's not that, Haha. Listen to me.

1590
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,910
Gary ripped most of it.

1591
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,840
I got away though.

1592
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,010
I didn't know that.

1593
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,540
- How can you not know?
 -  You showed your back too easily.

1594
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,440
And it's not even that.

1595
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,280
It's the fact that I was helping you.

1596
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,540
I don't want to be like this, but I can't help it.

1597
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,310
I don't want to do this either.

1598
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,120
But I can't control myself any more.

1599
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,510
I'm upset, too. I don't know why I'm like this.

1600
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,810
I drank a lot because of this.

1601
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,280
There's nothing I can do any more. I'm done for.

1602
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,050
- I can't change.
 -  He says he's done for.

1603
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,380
I really can't change.

1604
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,610
Okay. If it's that serious, I'll understand.

1605
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,810
- I really can't.
 -  He can't change.

1606
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,190
He can't go back.

1607
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,040
- We have to understand him.
 -  He can't change no matter what.

1608
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,040
- Some things can't be changed.
 -  I'm done for. I can't change.

1609
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,380
Stop it now. I understand.

1610
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,980
My cheeks hurt.

1611
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,940
My niece has big expectations.

1612
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,710
She said that she hopes...

1613
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,610
I'll stay alive until the very end.

1614
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,590
It's going to be on his SNS.

1615
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,810
Joon Gi practising ripping name tags.

1616
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:03,010
(Joon Gi practises diligently. Ripping name tags is hard.)

1617
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,580
I'm really going to practise.

1618
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,580
(I'll get revenge.)

1619
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,680
(I'm sorry, my niece.)

1620
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,780
(What's going on at the site of The Rebellion of the Princes?)

1621
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,830
(They all ripped one name tag except for Ji Hyo.)

1622
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,680
A mysterious cushion has appeared.

1623
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:25,680
The cushion is on the second floor of the main building.

1624
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,280
(The 2nd cushion is on the 2nd floor of the main building.)

1625
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:34,410
(Jae Seok is the first to enter the cushion zone.)

1626
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,740
(At this rate, the prince sniping chance will go to Jae Seok.)

1627
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:47,180
(Who will be Jae Seok's target?)

1628
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,840
Prince Jong Kook will never...

1629
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,010
be able to become the emperor.

1630
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,380
He won't become the emperor.

1631
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,330
(Jae Seok snipes Jong Kook.)

1632
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,610
Where is it? It's not over there.

1633
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,980
They said the second floor but there's nothing here.

1634
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,480
This doesn't make sense.

1635
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,880
I win if I just hold out for three minutes.

1636
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,080
The emperor's cushion has been operated.

1637
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,040
Someone on the second floor...

1638
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:20,140
has called out Prince Jong Kook's name.

1639
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:22,180
Where is it? Let's go.

1640
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,710
Please.

1641
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,940
(Please let's hold out for 3 minutes.)

1642
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,080
My goodness.

1643
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,380
(Who is this?)

1644
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,780
Get out when I say it nicely.

1645
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:38,310
Has it not been three minutes yet?

1646
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:40,380
- You're mistaken. It's not you.
 -  Get out.

1647
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,010
- Just get out now.
 -  Jong Kook.

1648
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,980
Get out when I say it with words.

1649
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,680
- Jong Kook, you're mistaken.
 -  Get off.

1650
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,940
- It's not you.
 -  I said, get off.

1651
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,380
- Jong Kook.
 -  All right.

1652
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,880
- Come on now.
 -  It's not you.

1653
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,180
- Get out.
 -  It's a misunderstanding.

1654
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,740
Get off when I say it nicely!

1655
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,040
- You're mistaken.
 -  Get off when I say it nicely!

1656
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,370
Get out!

1657
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,320
- Get out!
 -  Jong Kook.

1658
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,240
They called my name.

1659
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,510
I just heard it!

1660
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,680
(I'm sorry, Jong Kook.)

1661
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,850
I'm sorry. Please let me go.

1662
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,040
- What are you sorry about?
 -  I'm so sorry.

1663
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,460
(Be quiet and get out.)

1664
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,750
Jong Kook, I'm sorry.

1665
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,780
I'm sorry.

1666
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,180
Can't you be generous...

1667
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,610
and ignore it just this once?

1668
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,840
- If I get another chance,
 -  Why did you do that to me?

1669
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,110
- I'll never call your name again.
 -  You shouldn't have done it.

1670
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,980
A mysterious cushion appeared.

1671
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:27,010
- The cushion is on...
 -  Where is it?

1672
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,980
the ground floor of the annex building.

1673
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,580
(The person who obtains the cushion...)

1674
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,780
(will take the emperor's throne.)

1675
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:46,340
(Which prince will hold the cushion that will determine their destiny?)

1676
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,340
(Prince Jong Hyun sits on the cushion first.)

1677
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,250
(Who is his target?)

1678
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,680
Prince Jong Kook may not take...

1679
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,710
the emperor's throne.

1680
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,510
Also,

1681
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,710
(Also)

1682
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,110
I'll use my chance card.

1683
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,210
(It's time to use his secret chance card.)

1684
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,250
Play the music.

1685
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,080
(Prince Jong Hyun won "The Princes' Bows".)

1686
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,340
There must be something like teleportation.

1687
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,440
(He was given a chance card.)

1688
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,880
Jong Hyun has an advantage.

1689
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,480
(Music card)

1690
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,250
I'll use my chance card.

1691
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:39,280
(Play the music.)

1692
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,430
Everyone, freeze. Someone used a chance card.

1693
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,440
What's going on?

1694
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,440
(What's the music card about?)

1695
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,880
Prince Jong Hyun's last chance is the music card.

1696
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,860
When the music card is used,

1697
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,300
nine princes except Prince Jong Hyun...

1698
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,480
must freeze immediately for two minutes.

1699
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,510
(Music card makes the other princes freeze.)

1700
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,140
(If we don't stop him, Jong Hyun will take the emperor's throne.)

1701
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,540
We don't know how long it'll last.

1702
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,140
This is such an advantage.

1703
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,510
(If we don't stop him, Jong Hyun will take the emperor's throne.)

1704
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:10,910
Prince Jong Hyun used his chance card.

1705
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,610
To follow the prince's order for everyone to sing and dance,

1706
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,370
DJ Seok Jin will play some music.

1707
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,080
Enjoy it.

1708
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,310
This is great. Here we go.

1709
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,340
(People are forced to dance for two minutes.)

1710
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,110
Goodness.

1711
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,540
I'm not in the mood to dance right now.

1712
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,880
Must we do this?

1713
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:38,080
Do we get to know whom he called?

1714
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,470
Whose name did he call?

1715
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,390
- He said Prince Jong Kook.
 -  What? Me?

1716
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:43,680
That was great.

1717
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,340
This is fun.

1718
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,980
We don't know how it'll turn out.

1719
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,210
Come on. Let's go.

1720
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,680
(They must stop Prince Jong Hyun before three minutes are up.)

1721
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,410
Jong Hyun has the most advantage.

1722
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,650
I should have eliminated him.

1723
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,780
I hope Jong Hyun wins.

1724
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:07,840
(All he has to do is last a little longer.)

1725
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,580
(They must take him off of the cushion before the time is up.)

1726
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,250
- Can we move when the music stops?
 -  Yes.

1727
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,440
(The music stopped.)

1728
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,180
Has it stopped?

1729
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,210
(Has it stopped?)

1730
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:30,380
(Jong Hyun, you've been waiting long.)

1731
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,180
(He shudders.)

1732
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,450
Move out, Jong Hyun.

1733
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,480
Move out.

1734
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,680
(Frightened)

1735
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,710
What's going on?

1736
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,080
(Jong Kook's anger...)

1737
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,140
(is about to explode.)

1738
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,180
Hey.

1739
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,580
Goodness.

1740
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,130
(Prince Jong Kook tries to take revenge on Prince Jae Seok.)

1741
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,380
(What do I do?)

1742
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,610
Give me a chance.

1743
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,780
Come here now.

1744
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:03,610
(If any of them take a name tag, they can become an emperor.)

1745
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,580
(They start to move.)

1746
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:08,760
Why doesn't it come off?

1747
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,040
(Now, everyone has a chance to become an emperor.)

1748
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,250
Why doesn't it come off?

1749
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,940
(Who will it be, Prince Jae Seok or Prince Jong Kook?)

1750
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,980
(Is it Prince Jong Hyun or Prince Ji Hyo?)

1751
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,780
(Who will take the emperor's throne?)

1752
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,780
(A name tag tears.)

1753
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,080
(The Rebellion of the Princes ends.)

1754
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,140
Everyone, come this way.

1755
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,390
Goodness.

1756
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,940
Here comes the emperor.

1757
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:41,980
(May the emperor live forever.)

1758
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,610
(The royal face of the emperor is revealed.)

1759
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:48,140
- Is he the emperor?
 -  Is he really the emperor?

1760
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:51,080
(His appearance seems awkward.)

1761
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,910
- Is that him?
 -  No way.

1762
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,840
(He trips immediately.)

1763
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,180
He's a eunuch.

1764
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,840
- I know you're a eunuch.
 -  I'm playing two roles.

1765
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,380
(He's a hybrid eunuch.)

1766
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,080
Are you envious of me?

1767
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,980
Now, I'll turn over the throne.

1768
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:11,250
(Now, I'll turn over the throne.)

1769
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,880
(Who's taking the emperor's throne?)

1770
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,280
- How many times have you won?
 -  I'm sorry.

1771
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,380
- You're so tactless.
 -  That's not true.

1772
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,610
You're so tactless.

1773
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,250
(The one to take the emperor's throne is...)

1774
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,380
(During the decisive match 10 minutes ago)

1775
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,410
(A name tag gets torn.)

1776
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,680
I did it. I did it.

1777
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,940
(Jong Kook eliminated Prince Jae Seok.)

1778
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,280
Why didn't it come off easily?

1779
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,810
Why is Jong Kook so good at tearing?

1780
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,480
(Prince Jong Kook takes the emperor's throne.)

1781
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,310
I'll turn over...

1782
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,540
- the emperor's throne to you.
 -  Thank you.

1783
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:48,980
My gosh.

1784
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,410
(Emperor Kim Jong Kook)

1785
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,880
(Prince Jong Kook puts on the royal robe.)

1786
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,250
Did you bring it yourself?

1787
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,170
Is this your actual outfit?

1788
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,060
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1789
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,230
That's mine.

1790
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,970
Joon Gi was very ambitious today.

1791
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,530
- Joon Gi worked hard.
 -  He was very ambitious.

1792
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,440
I want to be on the show again.

1793
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,780
I'll practise all night.

1794
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,880
(I'll come back for a revenge match.)

1795
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,680
I feel very awkward and left out.

1796
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,020
I'm sorry.

1797
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,440
- Why am I standing alone in this?
 -  Go back up.

1798
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,340
- Go and sit over there.
 -  I want to end the show with you.

1799
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,250
- Sit down.
 -  How many times have you won?

1800
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,940
- I feel lonely.
 -  I'm tired of it.

1801
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,580
- I'm tired of his winning.
 -  I feel lonely.

1802
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,510
- Good job.
 -  How many times did you win?

1803
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,110
- You can be the emperor forever.
 -  Goodness.

1804
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,020
The first episode of "Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo"...

1805
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,520
is going to air tomorrow.

1806
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,680
Don't miss it, and I hope you'll like it.

1807
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,340
- That's great.
 -  Thank you.

1808
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:44,080
(We thank Joon Gi, Ha Neul and Jong Hyun for being on the show.)

1809
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,140
(Complete Running Map)

1810
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,780
This is a problem.

1811
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,480
(A guide in entertainment, Cha Seung Won is here.)

1812
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,880
(Find the last piece and complete the map.)

1813
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,410
(Find R Mon hidden in various places.)

1814
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,610
- The last one is...
 -  There's another one.

1815
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,610
- We have two hints.
 -  I don't think that's it.

1816
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,860
Hey, I kicked it.

1817
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,280
- I've never seen it before.
 -  He looks so sexy.

1818
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,610
He's someone who loves variety shows.

1819
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,570
(And)

1820
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,480
I can't believe it.

1821
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,510
Just follow the order.

1822
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,980
What's going on?

1823
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,590
Why would I go to prison?

1824
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:18,680
How could this happen on the train?

1825
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,340
I'm not a criminal.

1826
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,940
If I succeed, can I escape?

1827
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,300
You're not Hyo Lyn today.

1828
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,310
Why did you do that to me?

1829
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,140
(Train to Prison is coming soon.)
